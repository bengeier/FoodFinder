{"text":"Great place for happy hour! (4-7pm). I've had both the triple sliders and the half-rack ribs (on different days btw). If you near 101 & N. Scottsdale near happy hour, this is the best place in the area to eat!"}
{"text":"Service was good..way over priced for the quality of food for a steakhouse. Prime rib was chewy and our filet was over cooked."}
{"text":"DO NOT GO HERE- VERY ILL MANAGER SERVING FOOD!!! I have never written a bad review on here, but this is a matter of public safety. Yesterday on 2/4/17, my husband and I came in for lunch. An assistant manager was coughing ( constant, wet hacking cough) all over the kitchen and food prep areas. She was serving food as well. We told the head Manager who was a bit snarky and said \" well, that's why I sent her home\". Unfortunately for all guests, he really didn't. She walked out the front door and quickly returned, back to the kitchen and handling food. We left and my husband asked the manager why he lied and why this was okay to endanger so many people with someone who was so very sick. He said nothing and was very lax in his overall concern for health. Very disturbing and gross!!! Real shame because we use to go here all the time."}
{"text":"A much anticipation of a return trip to WCG,and I must say I was terribly disappointed. For starters, we HAD a reservation and it still took us 40 minutes (and several inquiries) to get our table..... Once seated, a good 10 minutes passed before our server came to our table. Had to ask for water refills. The food, while good was a bit pricey (accept for the dessert, I will say it was yummy) Sadly, I will not be returning here anytime soon."}
{"text":"White Chocolate was hands down is my most favorite dinner ever and restaurant now! Suzie and the gentleman helping her were amazing I forgot his name I feel bad, food was amazing. my boyfriend and I had the Arizona egg rolls for a starter they were mouthwatering ahh With freshly squeezed lemonade. (Which I drank lile 500 of) I also had the New York strip cooked perfect with mushrooms and gravy with garlic mashed potatoes and the honey grilled carrots. I THINK I died and went to heaven. It was wonderful and also had the Banana cream vanilla pie for desert. Forgive me if I didn't say the names right. Then I realized I was in heaven. That pie was the best pie I've ever had in my life. I love white chocolate I can't wait to be back. My boyfriend said his hat was off to the chefs and to the staff great team work and thank you to the awesome staff for making my birthday!!!"}
{"text":"I am gluten intolerant and have been extermly excited about finding the WCG.  However, my experience didn't live up to my expectations. We had 3 different servers, which did make it slightly difficult to figure out who was actually helping us.  With this confusion we only received our drinks and main course. Sadly, this was my husbands birthday and did cast a little cloud for awhile on our evening. As I mentioned i was slightly upset over our dinner and manager never came and stopped by our table. However, I did really like the atmosphere here, the kitchen appeared calm and the host staff which we were sitting close to were professional.   I gave the WCG 3 stars due to the quality of the meal we did have and i can tell the resturant is manged well.  I would go back and give another chance."}
{"text":"White chocolate grill has recently decided to include a surcharge for dining with them. It is called P206.  Check your bill when you receive it. I encourage you to complain about it as well. Management decided to hide it on your bill versus the menu hoping less people will see it and question it.  Check out Charleston's right down the street."}
{"text":"best french dip ive had in a long time my wifes bbq platter was good too she really liked the ribs the only down side of this place is the wait and its just too dang dark its nice to see the food your eating"}
{"text":"We were there last evening for dinner. Excellent service and attention even after my sister's dinner was not made to order. Appreciated the wait staff and floor manager helping us when the food was not prepared correctly. Recommend a number of their dishes as it reminds me in terms of menu and atmosphere of Houston's in Atlanta and Bricktop's in Nashville, TN."}
{"text":"This is a \"must\" visit whenever we are in Scottsdale - always a great experience. LOVE the Grilled Artichokes and Wild Mushroom Soup (when you can get it!) and the WCG Bacon Blue Cheese Salad too.  Too many great choices, so little room in the stomach!"}
{"text":"I brought my wife here because of the reviews of other Yelpers. We had the dinner for 2 for $29 bucks each. Outstanding dinner. The servers were very attentive. No empty glasses here.  Our server, Colin, knew how things were made and offered some great recomendations. Next time we're in Scottsdale we'll be sure to come back. I've paid a lot more for a lot less. Thanks for the nice evening."}
{"text":"The food and service here is always excellent. Nice casual and comfortable but upscale environment. On the expensive side, but quality and service live up to the prices."}
{"text":"I have had lunch at The White Chocolate Grill several times and it never disappoints. The service is good and quick, but not real friendly. I have been frightened by the hostess a time or two. But neither keep me away. I love their special sides. They are fabulous every time."}
{"text":"Love the name, love the guacamole, love the crab cakes, love the French white chocolate bread pudding, somewhat disliked the service.  It is very luxurious ordering from a menu that starts with the desserts.  We split the guacamole which was pretty good.  Good flavor, not bland.  The chips were too salty for my tasting, but a friend loved how much salt there was.  The salsa was good too, nice and spicy.  I ordered the crab cakes for dinner which were awesome.  Two crab cakes with large lumps of yummy crab.  Not breaded (the best kind of crab cakes), and as the accompaniment I chose the couscous.  The couscous was pretty good on first taste, then all the mayo and nuts in it made it feel so heavy in my stomach.  I think I ate about 5 small bites and couldn't eat anymore.    We shared the bread pudding for dessert.  It was hard to gauge how good it was as I was sooooo full already.  It was pretty good for bread pudding, the white chocolate sauce was tasty.  I'm a fan of regular 'ol chocolate (esp. dark...mmm) but the white chocolate-ness of this dessert was pretty delicious.    The only complaint I have is the service.  As we waited for another friend to arrive, he didn't come by for what seemed like forever!  And some of us were ready to order drinks.  He didn't seem all too friendly or willing to serve us.  The ambience was nice, good for conversation.  As other reviews say it was dark in the restaurant, it wasn't bad as each table had a light overhead with just enough illumination for social dining."}
{"text":"I do like White Chocolate a lot.  The food is very consistent and the service is freindly.  I wish they would allow take out on the weekends, as not everone has the energy (quite frankly) to go out to dinner on a friday night, sometimes take out and a movie at home is best, and depending on the day, they don't do take out orders.  other wise I really like the WCG salad and one of the better hamburgers in town!"}
{"text":"Diet advice: Never eat more chocolate than you can lift!  Placed gets packed quick! Make sure you have reservations!  The food was good. Expensive but good. Honestly it takes a lot to screw up Traditional American food. They had a deal that at $60/per person you could sample a lot of what they had to offer. Everyone at my booth took it and we got to sample almost everything!   Their white chocolate brownie was amazing. I usually don't like white chocolate. I like my chocolate like I like my.....nights? Dark? (dumb dumb dumb) but it was really good.  Go for dessert. Stay to people watch- seriously, the people in AZ are different. Or maybe it's just because people think I look Mexican. You won't deport me back to Cali!"}
{"text":"Called for a take out order and was told by hostess that she was to busy to take order. 1st time in my life I've ever heard such a thing. This struck me as strange as I have only had great service and food from WCG. I'm sure I will give WCG another chance to give 5 stars."}
{"text":"Let me just be blunt and cut right to the chase here, this place's bread pudding dessert is amazing. Like to die for. i live in New York and went here to visit Arizona State, but may i say one thing Arizona has are resturaunts! I also have to say that the Baked chicken dinner with the Candied Carrots is delish!! i absolutely love this place and will be returning on my next visit."}
{"text":"Great overall value.   Food is great and you can get   good healthy selections, too.  Bar has great ambiance.  Tomato Gin soup, to die for.  Cajun fish sandwich is a favorite!  1/2 rack babyback ribs at happy hour for $6.00!! Other decent selections as well.  Regular menu has something for everyone that won't break your budget and plenty to share if so inclined!  Great place for a nice night out when you don't want to spend your entire paycheck! And I didn't even mention the deserts...heavenly!"}
{"text":"We used to live in Gilbert for 21 years.  Almost 5 years ago we moved to Oceanside, California.  White Chocolate Grill is my favorite restaurant in the Scottsdale area.  It used to be a frequent dining spot for us, and since moving we never miss eating there at some point when we visit the area.  This past Saturday night we had another wonderful meal there. We sat in a cozy booth by the patio door.  Anthony was our waiter.  We've had him several times before and he is such a great server!  He is kind, fun, never rushes us, makes great suggestions, and makes our dining experience first rate.  I'm always amazed at how he anticipates our needs before we even vocalize them! We never have to wait for refills, our finished plates to be cleared, etc. I love how the whole staff has each other's backs.  I wish you would open a restaurant in the Oceanside/Carlsbad area! We miss it for sure. Oh! I almost forgot! The food is the bomb!! We had the French Dip and the Cajun Chicken Sandwich with Carrots (duh!) and Mashed Potatoes. Thank you so much for a great dining experience! Great food, great ambiance, great service.  You won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"The experience was  exceptional. Be sure to order the grilled artichoke - to die for! The grilled sea bass seasoning was amazing & grilled to perfection. Idaho trout, veggies all superb. Server Cody kept our martinis fresh with new chilled glasses - A first in our dining experience & earned an extra tip. Had to pass on tempting desserts due to diet but OMG had to be yummy. Don't miss this!!!!"}
{"text":"Great lunch salads; had the wild caught ahi tuna and was delicious. Friend enjoyed the filet mignon Cobb style salad and pop enjoyed the blackened mahi mahi... thumbs up all around!"}
{"text":"Umm I can't see what the fuss is about in the other reviews.  Our server was mediocre, passing by our empty glasses, and food was just, meh. I had chicken soup that tasted like enchilliata sauce. The Caesar salad was big and in a big bowl-nothing special.   I agree with Justin from Dallas.  Anyone from out of town, keep looking."}
{"text":"I love this place. I have been there a couple of times and the food and services is always top notch. Try the filet mignon salad or the french dip! They are soooo good!"}
{"text":"Great food, excellent waiter, Justin, if we are ever in the area again it would be on our list"}
{"text":"my gf and i go for martinis. we imbibe in happy hours and happy hours alone. the thought of paying three times more for the same thing by arriving one hour later offends me deeply. having said that, i will pay full price for one item on their menu.  grilled artichokes. i have prepared artichokes for ages and i love them done in every way. but, this. this! is undeniably the best prepared artichoke ever conceived. it is cut in half, grilled and served with amazing grated parmesan. full of flavor and absolutely worth paying full price.   the rest of the menu is all right. there are a few plates that are tasty, but you can get the same dishes in fifteen different restaurants in the same zip code."}
{"text":"slow service but good food! really liked the chicken salad. sooo good."}
{"text":"The best baby back ribs in town!  We are frequent visitors to the WCG.  The service is very good and the food outstanding.  They also offer good kids' meals."}
{"text":"This was the second visit made to The White Chocolate Grill- allowing another chance for this popular and well-regarded restaurant to give me a reason to include it in the repertoire of eateries I frequent.  I wanted to like the place so much, the name just spoke to me with my love of all things white chocolate, but it seems I will have to find a way to convince myself to give them one more chance to redeem themselves...  I'll tell myself that this time I should cut them some slack because it was not only Valentine's Day, but our reservation was so late, at 9:30pm. I'll tell myself that this time I had a migraine and, yeah, we ordered with a few minor changes to accommodate our personal tastes and dietary / allergy needs... (Could she please substitute Monterey Jack for the Pepper Jack and please no mayo on the chicken sandwich... And could I please have either avocado or guacamole instead of the mayo on my burger? Which one? Guacamole, please. Thank you.)  Did we get seated fast after arriving early and there being more than a dozen people waiting for seating before us? Was both our hostess and server polite and perform professionally? Did the food arrive quickly and presented nicely? Was the atmosphere pleasant and tasteful? Was the food delicious? All these are \"Yes\"  Was the food prepared correctly? Well, not entirely. The burger was served with avocado rather than the requested AND confirmed guacamole, however, it was also served with the dressing still on it. Minor and easy mistake really, but was really expecting \"perfection\" after seeing the ruthless corporate efficiency with which this restaurant is run during our short time there. Oh... and the fries (ugh- shoestring), while seemingly homemade, well, they left much to be desired- at least more than the messy scattering of limp, greasy potatoes that adorned our plates (sans the ketchup which one must order with their food- we did).  Am I being a tad harsh? Probably. The problem, though, is that my previous visit several years ago was marred by two pretty major issues... My mother chose to treat me to my birthday dinner at WCG- she arrived earlier than I did and was directed that she should sit in the bar area to wait for me. Mom sat directly at the bar top and when asked what she would like to drink, requested a margarita. Her bartender flitted away without further conversation and returned a few moments later with her beverage.  I arrived and joined her at the bar top, whereupon I asked what she was drinking, and she informed me a \"regular margarita, nothing special\"... I inquired whether she had asked for something specific- be it by drink name or alcohol brand / variety- since I had also picked up the tab in front of her to pay it so we could move to a table for dinner and saw a check for nearly $20! She confirmed she had said nothing more than \"margarita\" and the bartender had not made any suggestions, let alone ask if she wanted something more than a simple \"well\" margarita. Nice way to take advantage of your guest, not to mention one who is a senior citizen.  After paying the tab, we had the hostess arrange a table for us and we were seated promptly. Dinner plans came to a screeching halt within minutes, sadly- I'm a vegetarian and there was nothing, save one salad, the chips & salsa appetizer, and dessert (at the time, not a one made with white chocolate, consequently...) on the menu for me to order. We inquired of our server whether there were any items on the menu which could be made vegetarian-safe and were told, after she had gone to the kitchen to verify, that the menu items I mentioned were the only ones available- others could NOT be modified (?)  Needless to say, we left and ended up having a nice meal at The Blue Agave Mexican restaurant in the same complex.  So, one star for the first visit, a generous four for the second visit- weighted average of three stars given. Let's hope the third time's a charm..."}
{"text":"The steak sandwich is one of the best sandwiches I've ever had. Tremendous flavors and textures. The atmosphere in the bar area is great with good happy hour prices. Great service and overall experience."}
{"text":"Good vibe and mix of people. Enjoyed the food. Quality of steak was a pleasant surprise. Nice choice of brews on tap with a trendy bar area.  Good service. Reminds me of the Cheesecake Factory."}
{"text":"We visited Arizona last month and ate lunch here after being advised by a friend.  This place is really as good as she said it was.  The food is delicious and the portions are very generous.  We enjoyed everything that we ordered in our party, but didnt get to try the dessert because we had no more room left in our tummies!  I can only imagine how good there dessert must taste."}
{"text":"We love coming here for happy hour.  1/2 rack of ribs and fries for $9. WCG Old Fashioned was so delicious according to my husband. Looking forward to coming back."}
{"text":"White Chocolate is one of my favorite restaurants in town (and also one of the coolest nicknames for a basketball player,  but I digress).  Everything on the menu is delicious, the drinks are fantastic (they have a really extensive bourbon list) and the desserts are fantastic.  The ribs and rotisserie chicken is probably my favorite dish, but I've never had a bad meal here.  Highly recommended."}
{"text":"I just don't know about this place.  We  had to wait for a table for an hour and a half.  Menu deceiving - oven roasted beets??  They were cold!!  Steak listed on a bed of mashed potatoes and we got maybe a tablespoons worth.  Waiter was not attentive.  Manager not very accommodating but did offer a side of mashed potatoes.  Not sure if we will return???"}
{"text":"The white chocolate martini is great! The crab cakes are good but the place is a little over priced in general. I prefer to visit for happy hour when I can make it. If not the drive is still worth one of the best martinis ever."}
{"text":"We are frequent visitors of the White Chocolate Grill ever since it opened.  We consider ourselves foodies and appreciate fine dining and trying new restaurants.  The service has always been great and the food has never disappointed.  We usually split the prime rib french dip sandwich and the meat is cooked medium and is very lean, hardly any fat.  The Au jus is standard.  It also comes with a horseradish dip as well which packs a little punch although not enough to open up the nasal passages in the summer.  The spinach/artichoke dip is very good!  The chips are thin and tasty with just the right amount of salt and the spinach/artichoke dip is better than Houston's (I know that sounds blasphemous).  The star of the show however is the \"soon to be famous\" White Chocolate Brownie...THIS is the most incredibly rich and pure decadent desserts we have ever had!  It is a MUST to try this dessert!  The combination of the the brownie, chocolate sauce along with white chocolate shavings, vanilla ice cream and whipped cream is the perfect blend of all things sweet without being overly sweet.  We've frequenting this place since our daughter was 6 months old and that was 4 years ago.  WCG has always been one of our favorite Saturday lunch destinations!    You gotta go!"}
{"text":"So, my dad took me here today and billed it as an \"upscale Houston's.\"  I think not. This place is a total Houston's rip-off.  Seriously, the decor is the same, the smell when you walk in is the same, the servers' outfits, the menu, the drinks, the silverware - I guess you see the point. So I ask the server, \"are you affiliated with Houston's?\"  He goes off on a story about how the WCG is an original concept and much better than Houston's - yada yada, save it for someone who isn't an aficionado of the Houston's persuasion. If you are going to say all of that, and clearly be a rip-off of my *favorite* restaurant, then you had better live up to the name.  And frankly, they don't.  I had the seared ahi tuna salad with mango and avocado (surprisingly, Houston's has the EXACT SAME SALAD - only better).   It was good, as I was jonesing for some tuna - but I could have done without the heavy sesame crust and the drenching with dressing.  My dad has the rotisserie chicken, and was so disappointed that they ended up taking it off of the bill (it was cold and dry).  We both had fresh-squeezed Arnold Palmer's - and they had ooky sugar-coated rims.  No thanks. The french fries were excellent, yay french fries.  Oh, and surprisingly, you can get them with mustard-honey dressing, just like at Houston's - though again, it wasn't as good. You know, it is probably a 3-star restaurant, but I was so put-off by the whole \"we aren't Houston's and that restaurant sucks\" attitude - when they are so clearly trying to be Houston's, that I will not ever be back.  If I want Houston's I will get the real thing, and it will taste better. Plus, I think the name is super lame.  The service was fine, the place is fine - but just go get the real thing, it is worth the wait.  **UPDATE** I upped my star rating to 3 because the GM contacted me and explained a bunch about the restaurant.  I really appreciate such personalized customer service - he certainly didn't have to be so nice.  So, I will try WCG again and hopefully pull the rating up another star!  I still think the name is funny . . .  ** ANOTHER UPDATE ** I was harassed by a fellow \"reviewer\" of the WCG who was clearly affiliated with the restaurant.  This \"reviewer\" has no other reviews and is a bit fishy.  I do not appreciate being contacted to argue about the experience I had and this type of activity destroys the integrity of Yelp.  I will not be returning to WCG and neither will anyone I know in AZ (they will all be hearing this story!).  Plus, we like Houston's better, anyway, so this will not be a loss!"}
{"text":"2 part review.  1) food was fantastic. Filet Cobb salad was amazing and you can't go wrong w anything salmon.  2) the staff and management Could not have given better service.  Wife and I were out for our last date night before our baby boy got here (due date is 3 days from now) and there was a small delay in the kitchen before our entrees came out.  LiterAlly maybe 20 min..... we were just enjoying our time together and they went way above and beyond to compensate for the delay.  Hannah is a fantastic waitress.  Can't say enough about there willingness to ensure we had a good experience."}
{"text":"We've lived in AZ for over a year now and TWCG is one of our most frequented restaurants. I don't think we've ever had anything bad there. The roasted chicken is unbeatable. Over Thanksgiving they had the best pumpkin pie I've ever tasted. They have plenty of service and everyone is always nice. Its a little dark so its more of an intimate feel. Definitely recommend this place!"}
{"text":"Amazing food, amazing service, amazing atmosphere!  That says it all.  Check out the White Chocolate Grill for yourself and I think you'll agree.  And if you're from Maryland, check out their Maryland-style Dancing Crab Cakes.  You won't be disappointed.  Moist, jumbo lump crab meat with Old Bay seasoning. Yum!"}
{"text":"This place was fantastic and the service was fabulous! I had the tomato gin soup, which is one of their house specialty. I almost locked my bowl clean. Our group had the mahi mahi, the soy-citrus salmon, the perfectly grilled salmon, and he balsamic ribeye. Everything was perfectly cooked and absolutely delicious! The white chocolate brownie was mouth wetting and a great finish to the meal. Our waiter was very attentive and helped us with our decisions and what to order. His recommendations on food and beverages was perfect!"}
{"text":"My wife and I stayed at a nearby hotel. I searched yelp to try to find a really good but not excessively expensive place to eat dinner. This place was our choice based on the reviews and we were trying to avoid the drive into the heart of Scottsdale.   It was a mistake. While the food is ok, this place is nothing more than a run-of-the-mill, strip shopping center concept restaurant. If you would be satisfied with something like that then go there. Otherwise make the drive into Scottsdale to one of the more quant places that I wish I had tried."}
{"text":"This is one of the spots we really enjoy eating at fairly regularly in the North Scottsdale area.  The food has always been consistently good. The grilled artichokes appetizer is something we get every time we go and they are always quite enjoyable. Service has always been very good and its one of the few places I order dessert at, always enjoying their bread pudding (which I normally don't like). The dining area is nice and provides a nice atmosphere to enjoy your meal in.  If you are looking for a consistent American grill style restaurant in the North Scottsdale area that delivers your money's worth, White Chocolate Grill is a great choice."}
{"text":"The waiter asked if we were from around here. Realized although this is near where we live and we've been living here for a long time, but never visited this place. Must be scared of chocolate on grill.  Well, this place is great. We found out they serve great steaks. We ordered New York Strip, Center cut fillet and BBQ ribs. All well prepared and tasty. Told waiter we would definitely come back."}
{"text":"White Chocolate Grill's Famous Chicken Salad is my absolute favorite salad in the world. I can't say much about the rest of the food, because I always get the same salad, but I've tried things others have ordered, and they've always been fantastic. The tomato gin soup is crazy good, and if they happen to have the cold sweet corn salad as a side dish, don't think twice before ordering that! Desserts are also good, as you'd expect from a place that lists them first on the menu. Service is always terrific, and the atmosphere is very nice (think Houston's)."}
{"text":"First time review: Great food and service! We received everything very quickly, and the server was friendly. I ordered the French Dip, and it was delicious! The white chocolate dessert (must get it here!) was great as well!   Second time review: We came here for happy hour, and everything was pretty good."}
{"text":"So I came in today and I had just gotten out of work so I was in dress clothes and all I wanted was a glass of water. I was waiting for the bus just outside the restaurant in the 109 degree heat and was feeling dizzy and dehydrated so I thought to myself why not walk in and ask for a water Togo right? Well apparently they couldn't even give someone a water to go when they offer to pay for it. It's Arizona, scorching hot out and still they wouldn't give someone a glass of water to go. That tells me everything I need to know about the type of people who run the place."}
{"text":"Definitely our family favorite place to go! Love the French dip and the code steak salad! Amazing glazed carrots never disappoint! White chocolate martini is a must have!"}
{"text":"Loved our time at White Chocolate! Josh our server was great, the food was spectacular, drinks awesome! Would recommend to anyone. My only complaint, everything on the menu sounded so good we had a hard time choosing."}
{"text":"Based on a suggestion we tried White Chocolate. From a meal cuisine standpoint it's 4 stars but from a value standpoint it's 5 stars. We had the Atlantic Salmon, Layered Chicken Enchiladas and the Tomato Gin Soup. The soup was wonderful...5 stars!  The salmon was very good but not special enough for 5 stars. The enchiladas were very good and quite a large portion. I'm a big guy and couldn't finish it. The nice thing is that the prices are very reasonable for a nice restaurant, will good atmosphere in Scottsdale which is why I say from a value standpoint it's 5 stars. We paid $53 for two and that included a glass of wine. Highly recommend when in Scottsdale."}
{"text":"Nice place. I went there for lunch with my coworkers, had tuna grill burger it was awesome.  Service: I order for Tuna but instead got the veggie burger, waiter and manager both came over to apologize and didn't charge me for burger. Which shows me how much they care about their customers.  I would recommend this place to anyone."}
{"text":"What a great place if you are looking for a good (reasonably priced) steak. It is one of my girlfriend's favorite restaurants. She loves the Parmesan Crusted Filet and my Filet Mignon Cobb Salad was delicious. The bread pudding is the bomb for dessert! Nice restaurant environment, intimate setting for date night, and the restaurant was pretty quiet."}
{"text":"This is one of our favorites and last night was no different. Glad we made reservations because it was quite crowded. Very friendly and capable staff makes dining here very enjoyable."}
{"text":"I've never had a roasted artichoke - or any kind of artichoke,  until I was brought by a good friend to WCG...I must say...DELICIOUS! The atmosphere was calming and relaxing and quite romantic. Service was impeccable and the food was served quickly and was really satisfying! I will be back for more! I didn't have dessert as I knew it would be WAY too good! I do recommend the drive to get to WCG if you don't live close by. It is worth it!"}
{"text":"First time here for lunch. Had filet salad which was wonderful. Can't wait to go back and try something else. Service was great. Attentive, friendly, refills without asking. Very pleasant atmosphere and service."}
{"text":"Their quinoa veggie burger is the best veggie burger I've had in a long time. It's not dry, it's flavorful and has texture to it. This is a place where I consciously choose to make room for dessert. The bread pudding is amazing, it's light, it's fluffy, it's sweet but not *just* sweet. You know how some desserts just seem to have only one taste setting and they might as well have brought you a huge pile of sugar? The souffle is delicious as well. Nice atmosphere,  relaxed but classy."}
{"text":"We had a department function here on Friday last week. Amazing food and the best service I have experienced in a while. Never a bad experience at White Chocolate Grill. Try the Tomato Gin Soup."}
{"text":"Enjoyed the BBQ trio, and a very good selection of draft beers. I'd recommend it, and will be back next time I'm in Scottsdale."}
{"text":"This has really become our go to spot. The restaurant has a wonderful feel to it and the staff has always been great. We often bring friends and out of town guests here and everyone loves it. I have never had someone not like a meal they have ordered. The menu is extensive and prices are reasonable. I love the famous chicken salad and my husband goes crazy for their burgers. Be sure to save room for their banana cream pie! I don't like pie (or bananas really) but this is one of the most incredible desserts I have ever had!"}
{"text":"First time here with my date.. The food was great an tasty though a bit on the pricey side. Very nice place and again the food was good.   The service on the other hand was very weak at best. She never said her name, only asked to fill our drinks one time, and really was not very communicative. Hopefully she is just having a bad day  I would still come back because the food is good."}
{"text":"I'm not one to complain, however I don't think it's right that they snuck in a surcharge onto my bill for prop 206. If you want to increase your prices or print new menus (the reason I was given by the waiter) don't try and slide an additional surcharge (tax) on the bill an expect your customers not to notice.   As a small business owner, I understand the financial impact of prop 206 but I feel it's completely unethical to add a surcharge (tax onto your bill) to cover the overhead expenses and hope your customers don't notice.     As a side note the food here is fantastic but management trying to hide a surcharge is just not right."}
{"text":"It's a great place to dine. Lovely ambience and awesome food. I would surely recommend this place."}
{"text":"My wife and I were in town for a meeting and found the WCG on Yelp. Made a reservation through the Yelp app and it worked great - and would highly recommend a reservation on the weekend.  I had the center cut filet and it was amazing! My wife (also an obligate carnivore) had the bleu cheese crusted filet and, while good, I think the bleu cheese actually distracted from an amazing steak. The white chocolate-raspberry cheesecake was outstanding! And the Dean martini was pretty well done. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"This was an all around wonderful experience. I can hardly wait to return!  Service: The hostesses were friendly, kind, and calm despite the Friday night rush. The service continued to be outstanding with my server, Sean, who was patient and full of great suggestions, not to mention let me sample three beers before deciding on one. He was perfectly attentive and never too present.   Food: Just fantastic. Started with the house specialty soup--Tomato Gin--and I have never been so in love with a soup. Full of amazing flavors, creamy but not heavy, and some vegetables for adds texture. Had the Ahi Tuna appetizer as my entree which, once again, was full of a variety of flavors and every bite was uniquely satisfying. I cannot wait to go back!  Atmosphere: perfect amount of soft lighting, music level was loud enough to hear but certainly not overbearing, and the seating is very comfortable--the bar area is very cool with the lit up wall!  I was stunned by how great this experience was. Highly, highly recommended!"}
{"text":"My mojito and salmon were delicious! Plus, our waiter was attentive but not evasive. I will definitely be going back!"}
{"text":"This is a great restaurant. We thoroughly enjoyed the salmon with soy/citrus and the different and delicious Brussels sprout salad. My husband's ribeye was the best he has ever eaten. Delicious and unusual grilled artichoke, honey carrots were also standouts. We don't  have room for dessert but we may have to order the chesecake. Our waiter, Marty, was superb!"}
{"text":"I have probably eaten here close to 30 times over the past few years.  Even after all of those meals I can't remember either myself, or the people I have eaten with, being disappointed.  And for those of you who haven't tried the restaurant yet, or for those of you who don't like to make many decisions for yourselves, here you go: start with the AZ egg rolls, order the Cajun chicken sandwich for your main course, and then chase all of that with a fresh baked apple pie for dessert."}
{"text":"I ordered their Famous Grilled Chicken Salad. Soooooooooo good!! Really fresh, just the right amount of dressing. I almost licked the plate it was so good. We brought our two year old and were surprised to find a kids menu (although she refused to eat anything). They also had booster seats and high chairs. The next time we're in town we are definitely going back."}
{"text":"Excellent service, friendly staff, and great food. Got the New York Strip, looked like a small portion, but was very filling and perfectly cooked. Finished the night with the white chocolate brownie, was excellent as well. Overall: new favorite restaurant in Phoenix area."}
{"text":"While not our first time here, I felt I had to leave a review after last night's amazing service. First, everything we've ever ordered here was great. The dishes are creative and I'd definitely recommend this place for fine dining. Prices are reasonable.  Last night we are here for my boyfriend's birthday dinner. Ashley was our server and she was very lovely! What gets me is the staff is very knowledgable about the food and able to describe everything. She was great! We ordered everything they had on special last night. We decided on the silky gluten free chocolate soufflé for dessert. I felt it was good, but super dry and crumbly. Thinking it was just supposed to be like this and I just didn't like it, I ignored it. Ashley came by and asked how we liked it. After telling her it was a bit dry she offered something else. We declined as we had eaten some of the dessert already. A few mins later a manager came over with a fresh one and stuck around while we tried it. It was completely different and moist! Delicious! She comped it for us. It just happened that we got a bad one.  This place really cares about your experience. Highly recommended and we'll be back! Thanks Ashley and manager (sorry we forgot your name!)"}
{"text":"This place was really pleasant to go to because I really loved the food here and the service at the restaurant was terrific too.   The staff that I communicated with all had great personalities and they were super friendly and a pleasure to deal with and this was before I even had the awesome meal that they served up which cannot be described accurately in words how delicious it was, it was definitely was a great place to get something to eat, it is a little pricey but definitely worth it and I would completely recommend going there if you are in Phoenix because the food was awesome and I didn't mind paying a few extra dollars because I definitely think it was a good deal.   There's no doubt in my mind that I would go there again if I'm in Phoenix again because it definitely an awesome place to eat."}
{"text":"We eat here once a week, always great food, only negative comment is they don't   Seem to like to take any phone in orders to go,  but perhaps that is our fault and they are just not set up for that service.  Also the bar is actually a bit quieter than the restaurant area, strange as that may  seem. All around a great spot, would get 5 stars if they could handle to go orders with a bit more grace."}
{"text":"Consistently great food and service.  This week was our 10th visit there, and we highly recommend it. We have never had a mediocre meal....the appetizers, main courses and desserts are always excellent."}
{"text":"First time here. Very impresses with the service the Gumbo, Shrimp Coctail and Chicken Salad were great. The atmosphere is very nice. Prices were under what you would expect."}
{"text":"This is by far one of my most favorite restaurants.  Their ahi tuna appetizer is better than most Sushi restaurants, the service is always great.  I think they have the best hamburger and fries in town.  However, I love their ribs."}
{"text":"So as you can see I have written a previous review about wcg and gave it five stars.  There is nothing more disappointing than an inconsistent restaurant.   Tonight we had dinner at the bar. We had some drinks and ordered the spinach dip and split the steak sandwich.  All of the food was \"warm\", not hot.  That reminds me that a. My food was either sitting getting cold or b. the chefs just didn't spend the time necessary to complete the meal.  As well as the food not being hot, the steak on the sandwich may have been mooing still.  I love red meat but when it's chewy enough that I can't even take a bite of my sandwich then we have a problem.  I could have let the \"warm\" appetizer slide but it was the entire meal.  Inconsistency determines my return of establishments and I may skip returning here and spend my money elsewhere rather than \"maybe\" getting my moneys worth."}
{"text":"I have been here many times and usually order the WCG salad and soup, as I did tonight. I'm not a fan of onions and tonight I accidentally forgot to order my salad without onions. The server, Michele was very pleasant and noticed me picking the onions out. She was very quick to offer to have a fresh one made without the onions. I would not have asked since it was my mistake. She didn't hesitate. The salad was wonderful as always. The dressing is the perfect compliment too. I love the chicken enchilada soup. My mother loves the tomato soup. The WCG brownie dessert is wonderful and my husband loves the bread pudding. We didn't order dessert tonight, but it was really hard not to. We are not dessert eaters when dining out so When we do order dessert it's usually here and It's always difficult for us to make a choice between the two.   The service tonight was on point and well managed. We noticed this restaurant clearly trains their staff to help each other. Our drinks were always full and our completed dishes promptly removed.  We had a great date night experience. We will definitely be back!!  The only reason I didn't give a full 5 star rating is the noise level in this restaurant, as in most places anymore, is kind of high."}
{"text":"always friendly service and good food.  I like the atmosphere.  It's not too crowded to feel you have a little privacy...and it's not too noisy to have a conversation."}
{"text":"As a first timer to this establishment. I have to say I have no complaints. The food was awesome. The dessert is a must when you try this place."}
{"text":"I really do save my 5s for OUTSTANDING restaurants.  But WCG deserves a 4.7 or so.  Absolutely delicious and I cant wait to try something else.  We skipped appetizers to make sure we had room for dessert.  I got the bacon burger (over the steak sammich) as the waiter said the burgers were great.  And he was right.  Very fresh, nice seer on the outside and perfectly cooked. very fresh and seasoned well.  The mashed potatoes were good as well.  had a bit of a nutmeg/cinnamon thing goin on with it.  Different, but I liked it. wife had some type of Salmon.  I hate fish, but I tried it since she was raving about it.  It was actually very good and that pains me to say it.  I would actually order it...(if they ran out of red meat).  Then comes dessert.  Neither of us are bread pudding fans, but the waiter said it was the best.  He was NOT wrong.  Ive never had bread pudding like this before.  it wasnt mushy at all.  it was a hugemongous, dense, amazing, tasty treat.  the vanilla ice cream was a nice touch although it should have had a bit more of that.    Were goin again this week!"}
{"text":"This place opened on Mayo a few years ago.  I never went because I don't like white chocolate...so it didn't seem appealing.  I should have been more open-minded.    The menu has a great variety but I always end up ordering the Ahi Tuna Salad.  It is amazing.  However, it is rather small and pricey and each time I wonder if the salad is getting smaller and smaller.    Important to note, they do have a dark chocolate lava cake on the menu for dessert."}
{"text":"The Ahi tuna salad and Steak Cobb salad are the best thing on the menu. Nice selection of wines as well.  The menu can be a bit pricey but not crazy."}
{"text":"It was a quick decision on WCG for our business lunch since it's right across from the office, didn't really know what to expect, but the first experience was truly great!   There were 8 of us and of course I did not remember everyone's dish, but definitely remembered a few of them. Especially my Ahi Tuna Salad, it was delicious!! The salad had a really nice presentation, a good amount of dressing, and the fish was just melted into my mouth! The Filet Mignon Cobb salad looked really good too, and apparently was very tasty after seeing the empty plate. Another coworker had the Center Cut Filet, and according to her, you can really taste the flavor of having it on a wood grill, she liked it a lot and definitely enjoyed the side of roasted mushrooms as well.   We also shared a few desserts since the dessert section was on top of the first page of the menu..it means something, right? They were all good, but the one I was highly expected - the White Chocolate Bread Pudding - was just a okay, I guess I was expecting more of a real pudding, but not soggy bread in a chocolate and caramel syrup....if you're a texture person, I'll go for an alternative.."}
{"text":"Even if you don't like to eat white chocolate, you must get the bread pudding. Even if you are beyond full, you must get the bread pudding. It is that good. Ask for it a la mode, it's so worth it.  The four of us went to dinner at WCG on a saturday night at around 9 pm. We had a 10 minute wait, and afterwards we sat at a comfortable booth. The atmosphere is very nice and is good for a relaxing meal. To start, I shared the AZ egg rolls with my girlfriend. These come with 6 pieces (3 egg rolls cut in half), and coupled with a jalapeno ranch type dip and a side of salsa, all over shredded lettuce.   For dinner I ordered the Prime Rib french dip sandwich. The sandwich is delicious. It comes topped with horseradish sauce, a side of au jus, and a side order. I recommend the mashed potatoes, I ordered the fresh cut french fries, though these need work. They do not taste like fresh cut fries, but like greasy lower tier french fries.  For desert we shared the bread pudding and the white chocolate brownie. The brownie was meh, maybe a 5/10, but the bread pudding was great. Mix it with vanilla ice cream (which it doesn't come with, we took the ice cream off the brownie), and it's perfect.  I give White Chocolate Grill a solid 4 stars.  Egg rolls were around $9.00, Prime Rib french dip was $14.99, and the bread pudding was like $9.00. Not bad for a 3 course Saturday night."}
{"text":"Made reservations to celebrate our anniversary.  Check in went smoothly and on time, as it was a busy Saturday evening.  We sat for a while without being greeted by our server and then when she showed up she let us know that she was very good at what she does - btw...she is very mistaken...oh right...and happy anniversary (the only thing that happened for the event) not sure why they ask. (small token chocolate??)  She brought our drinks, took our order and that was about the last time we saw her.  Someone else brought the mediocre food, set it down and left.  My husband has entertained business guests a number of times and has been served an assortment of bread which either isn't done anymore or was left out.  We asked someone as they went by if we could have bread, he said it would take five minutes - wow!!  Two rolls came out on a plate that were hard as a rock and cold - microwaved for sure.  He ordered salmon, which was good, but the broccoli was cold.  I ordered chopped chicken salad which was drenched in dressing and I left half behind. Not once were we asked how are meal was by anyone.    Our glasses sat empty and we were never asked if we would like anything more to drink.  I finally asked for another club soda with lime and I was brought a glass of warm soda water, no ice or lime.  I asked if I could have ice, and she brought a cup of ice. Guess I have to combine the two!!  She did drop the check off and someone else finally picked it up to process it.  After much time, we had to flag her down - \"oh, did I not bring it back to you?\"  Nope...that's why we are still sitting here!!  Needless to say, she was the worst server we have ever had (and we eat out a fair bit).  What was suppose to be a really pleasant anniversary dinner, turned into an irritating disappointment of an experience.  We both agreed that we have had better service and overall dining experience as far less expensive restaurants."}
{"text":"I really like this place! I came in with a group of 4 and we were seated immediately. There was a decent amount of people there but the service was still fast. I had the sirloin steak sandwich, which was divine. My dad had the scallops, which were also very nice. My little sister had the kiddie ribs with a side of fries. The fries were great, but the ribs were only ok. For dessert our party shared the bread pudding. The only con was that the pudding was topped with a whole bunch of whipped cream when I thought it would come with ice cream. All in all, a good restaurant and I would come back for more."}
{"text":"We have been here once before over 5 years ago, so I thought it would be nice to come here for my birthday dinner. We had reservations for this past Saturday at 8pm. When we arrived we were promptly seated at a two-person booth, kinda small but just right for the two of us.  For an app we ordered the grilled artichokes. They were good but not great, would have preferred less leaves & more hearts. I also ordered a cocktail, the Flirtini, it was so tasty! For our entrees my hubs ordered the stacked chicken enchiladas with a side of rice & I ordered the ruby red trout with a side of mashed potatoes. My hubby liked his enchiladas but said he's had better. I loved my trout & so did my hubby because he helped me finish my plate. The herb goddess sauce that came with it was delish as well. The mashed potatoes were ok, definitely not \"freshly mashed\"-more like from a box! But the \"good gravy\" that came with it was indeed good. For dessert I ordered the bread pudding with ice cream. This thing was HUGE & oh so yummy! I took it home & bought some more ice cream & devoured it.   Our total came to about $85 (including tip), not bad at all! We would definitely come back."}
{"text":"Amazing!!! what a great place to go to and enjoy great food. Literally i have not tried anything over here and did not love. from salads to burgers to steak & sea just simply amazing. the best part about this place is the dessert, i just tried the white chocolate brownie and it was amazing, even tho we were stuffed if you take a bite then you're hooked. love this please my favorite spot in town."}
{"text":"I had a party of 13 and it was perfect. We sat on the patio which has a soft ambiance and a private atmosphere. The food was the best I've had this year and the dessert for two is so rich and so yummy. The presentation is beautiful. Our waitress, Lori, was the sweetest waitress I've ever had and is the reason our experience couldn't have been better. 5 star service, 5 star food, 5 star environment. This is our new go-to spot and should be yours too."}
{"text":"Kind of surprised myself, but I have to give them a five.  Let's begin with the drink was excellent.  I had some kind of pom martini that was one of the best I've had in a while.  I ordered the sirloin steak cobb salad.  My salad arrived two minutes after the people I was eating with, and it was taken off the bill....they also brought us a free dessert and apologized...really?  That's good service.  They may have even gone overboard, but I didn't complain.  The food itself was excellent.  I loved my salad, and it was a nice size portion.  All in all, a great experience."}
{"text":"Just had a wonderful dinner at White Chocolate Grill! Heirloom tomato Salad and Prime rib were amazing! Our server Rachel made us feel so welcome and taken care off,  as if we were in her home!"}
{"text":"Excellent meal. Excellent service. Eggs Benedict scrumptious.  White chocolate brownie out of this world. Had to eat slowly to enjoy it was so sweet."}
{"text":"This was the fourth time that I've been to the White Chocolate Grill.  It was also the last.  The food here, while not gifted with any superstars or outstanding and memorable dishes, is what I can best classify as \"good, if a bit expensive.\"  Except for the chocolate souffle cake, which tasted Easy Bake Oven-esque, the eats here are good, at the very least.  The ambiance is fine, too.  What's not good, decent, adequate or at all enjoyable, and the reason that I won't be coming back, is the service.  It's one thing if the guy who's supposed to get drinks says he'll be getting us water and will be coming back to take the actual drink orders in a minute ends up taking seven (despite us being about 15 feet from the bar, where one assumes water can be filled into beverage containers), and then forgets to take the actual drink order.  It's a whole other thing when the server is just terrible.  \"I'll bring you some plates for your appetizer,\" he said after setting it down.  Ten minutes later, our table plateless, he asked how it was while refilling my water glass.  He was so shocked that he forgot to bring the plates that he over-poured my water, spilling it onto the table.  He didn't clean it up.  He forgot to bring the requested condiments with our entrées until ten minutes after they'd been on the table (no idea why it was always in tens).  He conscripted other waiters into delivering our food, asking how the food was, and cleaning off the table (which he, at no point, really did - appetizer plates were still on the table by the time dessert was ordered).  He was scowling at us when talking to the table, but was much nicer to the table next to ours.  When you get down to it, choosing a restaurant is half about the food and half about the experience.  And in this case, the experience was bad enough to make sure that I won't come back.   Both stars are for the food, which as I mentioned before, was pretty good.  Just not good enough to justify the terrible server."}
{"text":"Very yummy... The tomato gin soup is to die for (must have a lot of gin in it because the asked to see my ID before they would serve it to me lol...)   The Blue Cheese Crusted Filet and the Barbecued Baby Back Ribs were both really good also. The prices are not to high for what you get.   The  Apple Pie was soooo good and the White Chocolate Raspberry Cheesecake wasn't bad either"}
{"text":"This would probably have to be one of my favorite restaurants. The service and food are exceptional. Usually when we go to the same restaurant I stick to the same thing, but WCG is the exception. The crab cakes delicious, prim rib fantastic and the dessert is awesome. Love love love this place."}
{"text":"I took a friend of mine out for her birthday last Friday (May 9th) and The White Chocolate Grill was her choice.  Neither of us had been there before but the menu looked very intriguing.  The facility is stylish and intimate - better suited for couples than just friends - and we were seated quickly and courteously.    I ordered the Citrus-Soy Glazed Salmon.  It was over cooked and floating in far too much, and quite non-distinctive, juice.  I didn't finish it.  When the wait person asked if I wanted it boxed I honestly told her that \"it wouldn't be worth it.\"  My friend had the Blackened Mahi.  The menu indicates that it was 'grilled, topped with crab meat and a tomato Creole sauce\".  When it arrived we both wondered where the crab meat was.  We envisioned something that would be at least visible.  She said that it was 'ok'.  I was probably more disappointed that she was because this was part of her birthday 'gift'.    For desert we split the White Chocolate Raspberry Cheesecake.  Although it was good I personally couldn't help thinking that is was just a 'dressed-up' Costco cheesecake.    The wait person was pleasant but disinterested and didn't even put a candle in the desert even though she knew it was my friend's BD.  I raise this as an issue only because sometimes the wait person can make turn an unpleasant experience around by doing something 'special'.  But it apparently never occurred to her that she was an integral part of the 'dining experience.'    Overall, our experience at TWCG was mediocre and in this price tier Houston's has them beat 10 to 1!  Maybe it is a good place for happy hour and a desert or maybe it's a 'date value' thing but I won't bother with it again."}
{"text":"Our second time dining here and another superb dining experience! Friendly and attentive service with absolutely delicious food. My family all enjoyed their entrees. A special shout out to the quinoa burger, carrots and cold green beans with pistachios. Yum, yum, yum. We topped it off by sharing the divine white chocOlate blonde and banana cream pie. We will most certainly return here when visiting Scottsdale!"}
{"text":"If I could give it 4 1/2 stars I could.  I'm feeling generous today so I'll round up instead of down.  The only thing I didn't like about the experience were the onions in my salad...But I'll get to that:  I enjoyed the Prime Rib French Dip.  The roll was soft and perfect for the sandwich.  The meat was very tender.  The horseradish sauce was spicy and creamy.  The french fries were real thin...perfectly crispy on the outside, salted perfectly, and \"mushy on the inside\".  I also enjoyed the Bacon Blue Cheese Salad.  The Maytag Blue Cheese was intense.  It was dressed perfectly.   It had tons of bacon, walnuts, and cheese.  It was a worthy salad.  The onions were unfortunate. They tasted bad.  I will go forth with good intentions and ASSUME that this was a one time event.    The service was spot on from greeting to delivering the check.  Knowledgable and attentive staff will always get a return visit from me!  5 stars for sure!"}
{"text":"When we go out to eat this is often our go-to place because it's easy and the menu has something for everyone, but the food quality is hit or miss. Unfortunately after my last experience I doubt we will return. I took some family on Saturday (day before Mother's Day) we arrived at 11:30am and the restaurant was very quite. They sat us at a booth that had a horrible stench of dirty mildew. We moved tables, but they were all the same. For just opening for the day this was just disgusting. We had their chips and guacamole to start and the chips were old and stale and for my entree I had their \"famous chicken salad\" and I can tell you it was far from famous. The chicken had an old foul smell and taste (the kind that makes you worry how sick you will be the next day). Horrible experience"}
{"text":"Very good food, the French Dip was excellent. Definitely worth a try."}
{"text":"Manager of that restaurant is terrible. We placed a very large order from our work which we do 3-4 times a week for lunch. I called to inform them of the bugs I found in my salad and the manager assumed I wanted something for free, which was not the case at all, the person who answered the phone insisted I speak to him. His exact reply to me was...\"What do you from me, you ordered take-out.\" completely blown away by his tactless reply I chose to never set foot there again. So when we order lunch each day we will never go there again nor will I take several clients that visit me daily there either. What really makes me mad was I never wanted anything, not free food or any money back, just to simply tell them my experience after they insisted I speak to the manager. It just goes to show the poor business choices people make with who they choose to run a business."}
{"text":"Always enjoyed coming here.  I've been to the location in Scottsdale and Denver at Park Meadows mall.  Never disappointed.  Decor is beautiful.  Great for lunch or dinner.  The one at Park Meadows is located next to an American Girl Doll store that doesn't have a cafe inside.  They honor the girls bringing their dolls to lunch.  Cute.  Skinny on the food:  I am one for mixing things up when I go to a restaurant BUT this place is the exception.  Filet Mignon Cobb Salad every time.  It's big enough to split with another person too."}
{"text":"This place had amazing reviews and I heard people rave about it! But it turned out to be a disappointment not nce but twice. The first night I got their house feature, scallops, they came charred giving them a bitter taste. The side of mashed potatoes was delicious. I went back for lunch the next day, because I wanted to make sure I wasn't missing out on something great, I got the French dip sandwich with fries which was good. Service was bad, the waiter was slow, brought in wet plates and didn't check in for water refill until the end of meal! I also got the bread pudding, bad choice too sweet, bread was hard. I have eaten much better bread puddings. All in all disappointing will not go back!!"}
{"text":"Amazing food! Went there on Sunday evening to celebrate a birthday. The ambiance was cozy and intimate with a nice pit fireplace outside of the restaurant.  We ordered the 4 cheese spinach and artichoke dip and the AZ egg rolls...Yum yum! For dinner we had the jambalaya which was spicy but delicious.  My friends ordered the crab cakes and blackened Mahi. Both were very fresh and moist. For dessert we shared the white chocolate bread pudding. ..we were in heaven!  Definitely a great place to go for a special occasion."}
{"text":"Have been a couple of times now and have ever been disappointed.  Honestly, the main reason I went back is their desert, and specifically, their bread pudding - I DO NOT LIKE bread pudding, but this one is to die for - it is frigging awesome.  They use croissants - OMG.  Anyway, their regular food is good too - steak sandwich, salads etc, but just make sure you leave room for the bread pudding.  Service is always good and just love looking at the bar as well - it is so pretty."}
{"text":"Great salmon, the BEST mashed potatoes and banana cream pie!  Service is excellent; all are friendly, conscientious, prompt!  The ahi tuna appetizer is good; loose the slaw (or atleast drain throughly before plating).  2nd visit last week with family in from San Diego; they too loved it!  Will be back and definitely recommend; worth the hunt to find!"}
{"text":"I met several friends here for lunch and ordered the ahi tuna salad.  After studying the menu, I was torn between the ahi tuna salad and the ahi tuna appetizer that comes with a coleslaw.   I read yelp reviews dealing with both and decided on the salad.  I was disappointed after all the hype, with several reviewers saying it was their favorite.  It was too sweet for my tastes, and there must have been less than 1 tablespoon each of mango and avocado.  It was basically mixed greens lettuce, with a tiny bit of mango and avocado, a dressing that was much too sweet, and a few poppy seeds sprinkled in with ahi on the side.  The ahi tuna was good, but not exceptional enough to justify the price.  It's not that it was gross, necessarily, just that I expected something more for the price.  I'd be willing to pay about $8 for this salad, but not $16.  Some reviewers complained about the quantity of lettuce and tuna...I thought there was plenty of both, but just that it was sort of a bland, flavorless, overly sweet salad.  I was not impressed with the rolls that came with the meal, either.  They were dense, like a muffin should be, not light and fluffy, and they were either way too sweet, or the butter that was served with them was honey butter.    The service was really good, though -- someone said the waiters were like ninjas, there when you needed them, but disappearing immediately afterwards.  We left an extra-large tip.  Also, it was pretty quiet out on the terrace, which was perfect for our large group."}
{"text":"We went here for dinner for the first time over the weekend and were unimpressed to say the least.  I had the grilled trout and it was the only thing that we ordered that actually came warm.  My husband ordered the ribs after our serve saying it was her favorite, the ribs came with fries and broccoli- all of which was cold to the touch, as was my broccoli.  I let the server know and she was going to get a new plate ordered; instead they threw the old plate back in the warmer and pushed the ribs back together.  No one came back to check on us after that except to bring the check.  The service was less than stellar and the mgmt who brought the food out didn't seem concerned at all.  I would not recommend nor would we go back.  We were hoping  for another good option near us but this is not it"}
{"text":"We have eaten at the White Chocolate Grill two other times, but it has been a while so we thought we would try it again.  Overall, we had the same impression as we have had in the past--it is okay but not a place to rush back to any time soon.  We took advantage of the date night special, a summer menu others have mentioned in previous reviews.  For the shared appetizer, we ordered the AZ eggrolls that were chewing and just not good.  To the credit of the restaurant they did take this off the bill without even being asked.  The salads were typical (green and Cesar were ordered). The entrees were very good, fillet and pork tenderloin.  One of the best parts of the meal was the couscous.  Very good and not typical of sides you order at other restaurants. We both thoroughly enjoyed this dish.  Our shared dessert was the bread pudding. Okay, but a bit too sweet for my liking. I still think Phoenix City Grille has the best bread pudding in town.  The biggest issue with this restaurant is around service.  I felt rushed. Salads were delivered less than 5 minutes after the appetizer.  The wait staff hoovered.  This really took away the end of the work week dining experience when you just want to relax and have great food feeling."}
{"text":"WCG has been a favorite for years. There is always a crowd so make a reservation. Very cool ambiance with dark lighting. The wait staff is very professional. We order the artichoke app every time. Recently I had the ribeye (their most popular steak) it was cooked to perfection. Nice and tender and juicy. My wife loved her tomato soup. And our 2 yr old scarfed down the kids pasta ( and my skinny French fries).  The food is delicious. This is truly as good as it gets."}
{"text":"They quoted us 30 minutes. It ended up being an hour. The service was crappy. Way  overrated."}
{"text":"I have eaten at the White Chocolate Grill a few times and had a good experience. We stopped in on a Saturday around 5 pm and a couple sat behind us with a dog wrapped in a yellow baby blanket its head peeking through.  I mentioned this to a manager and the hostess staff upon leaving the restaurant. They weren't aware of it being in the building even though the server commented on it.  Service dog??? I highly doubt. Either way, I won't be back."}
{"text":"My tip is definitely ask for Angelo or call in a resevation with him he's one of the best servers iv ever seen he knows his stuff ! His suggestions for meals, wine, and dessert will have you coming back for more."}
{"text":"My wife and I happened to drive past this establishment on our way to Bed, Bath and Beyond and were glad we did. As a vegetarian, we avoid restaurants catering to meat lovers. However, this restaurant serves the BEST Veggie burger--period. The burger was made of a quinoa blend which avoided soy. The burger tasted like a real meat burger! It was incredible. The staff was extremely courteous and polite. We will be back"}
{"text":"Amazing food and desserts, my new favorite place. I had the chicken crepes and oh my gosh I will go back for that again and again, they were delicious. The bread pudding was fantastic, so light and flakey, simply perfect!  We all loved it, one of the best meals I have had and  definately worth the calories on the desserts. Thank you for making my Mother's Day so Yummy!"}
{"text":"Every time I come here, the service, decor and food are top notch. They also have one of my favorite Cabernet's in Joel Gott.  You cannot go wrong with anything on the menu, including dessert. For appetizers; the Caprese is served in a bowl with cherry tomatoes and mozzarella balls, which is actually fun to pick at if you have other guests at your table. Never disappointed in WCG."}
{"text":"Stumbled upon this restaurant on line after searching for a place in Phoenix that was a bit nicer than the usual casual restaurants at Arizona Place in downtown PHX (think hot Mexican with cold beers, which we also like) - yet we still wanted to wear just nice jeans and a sweater. Great choice. Worth the 20 minute drive from PHX. We were a bit skeptical at first because it is a free standing restaurant in a mall parking lot, and in Boston, that usually means chain restaurants with mediocre food like Applebee's. Service was the best we had in Arizona. Four of us all loved our meals - Ribs, chicken, salmon, Guacamole (wow), trout & shrimp; steak were all cooked perfectly. The drinks were great as well, and the dessert is a must (any of them). Everybody has a different experience with the atmosphere, but we went on a Thursday night at 8pm and the place was only half full. Ambiance was nice: dimly lit, but not too romantic where you have to whisper. If you are with a group or a few people and are sitting around like we did - saying \"I dunno, where do you wanna go?\" Then head here. Menu on web site as well."}
{"text":"This place is great I had the most amazing salmon there with a citrus sauce and i was cooked perfectly like seriously if you've never been go to this place for your next date night!"}
{"text":"I could not have asked for more! My friends made reservations ahead of time for a party of 4 on a Saturday night. As two of us approached, we saw that it was packed. We figured that not only would it be a while before we were seated but that they would not seat us until all 4 of us had arrived (and our two friends always run late). As we walked to the bar thinking that we had time to kill, we were called back over and brought to our table. Not only was a table free for us but they let us sit. Wow! We ordered drinks and an appetizer while we waited for our late friends to arrive. We ordered the AZ Egg Rolls  - traditional egg rolls filled with spicy grilled chicken, corn, black beans and Jack cheeses with jalapeño dipping sauce and oven roasted salsa. It was some of the best that I have ever had in my life. As my meal I ordered the Famous Grilled Chicken Salad - field greens tossed with sliced grilled chicken, goat cheese, toasted almonds, golden raisins, cherry tomatoes and croutons in an aged balsamic vinaigrette drizzled with yogurt sauce. It was too big to finish so I took it home and ate it the next day. It was a warm environment and our server was professional and efficient. Great place to go on a date, had a cozy feel to it but was classy as well."}
{"text":"Did I mention in my profile that I LOVE white chocolate? :o) It's not a brainiac that for our anniversary I chose to test-drive the White Chocolate Grill.   Thank God that I reserved a table in advance with an easy on-line service on their website, because apparently this place is very popular and was pretty crowded already at 6 pm on a Sunday night. In my reservation I specified that we were celebrating our anniversary and all of my requests about a quiet romantic table were satisfied :o) It was actually very nice to receive greetings from the staff too!  We chose to go with the \"Date menu\", which allows you to taste an appetizer, 2 salads, 2 main courses, and a dessert all for a little under $30 per person. You would think the portions would be smaller... Well, that's what we thought and were wrong! For main course we had rib-eye steak and blackened mahi - YUM! The portions were real size and we thought we might need to take some of this fabulous food home, but then decided to finish this deliciousness there.   I could not leave without the famous white chocolate brownie dessert! Big chunks of white and milk chocolate in the cake and they even accommodated my request for extra white chocolate on top :o) YUM-YUM!   Great food and service! WTG definitely satisfied my hunger for white chocolate for a while now! When white chocolate fever comes back - I know where to find it now :o)"}
{"text":"The service we received this evening was Outstanding! Jason, our waiter, was Fantastic. The food was excellent, served hot and delicious. I could not have asked for a better server or a better evening at a steakhouse. My compliments to Jason, all the staff and management for an excellent evening out. Thank you very much."}
{"text":"I go go out a lot to eat around the valley for business and pleasure. This place always delivers !!! Food is fabulous, there's a little something for everyone. Servers have all been pretty good.. I was there Tuesday night and Amanda had taken care of my party and she's really amazing! Friendly, attentive and great memory to know what I drink before I order. (Im only here a few 1-3 times a mth w different servers) she's on it. WCG is a Fabulous place! Must try pumpkin cheesecake in Fall"}
{"text":"Always great service and great food.  Must have a reservation if you want to get seated right away.  It's loud, but all restaurants are these days.  This place has consistently delivered since I've live here and we always cannot wait to go back.  We love the Ribs (fall off the bone), the Prime Rib dipped as our go-to food but I've tried just about everything on the menu at this point and haven't had a bad meal yet."}
{"text":"This place is pretty good. I have been here a few times and enjoy this place a lot. The price isn't too bad, and the food is very delicious. I usually get the jambalaya, it is so tasty! They also have very good salads, and the burgers are also very good. The service is great and the atmosphere is quiet a bit dark so no one should be sitting at the table with sunglasses because that would just be creepy. Check this place out, if you enjoy a nice quiet place to enjoy a nice fine meal."}
{"text":"Joe in the Bar was wonderful! Great service and food was delicious. Bread pudding was perfect!"}
{"text":"Best fish I'd had since moving to Scottsdale. Totally recommend the citrus glazed salmon!"}
{"text":"You will never find a better restaurant. Hands down the best. My husband and I go here all the time for date night. The service and food is worth every penny. And we have yet to try something that we don't like. And you must always stay for dessert. The White Chocolate brownie is beyond praise."}
{"text":"I think everybody in my party would agree when I say that the food was orgasmic and the service was A+ as well. Will definitely be back here again."}
{"text":"Been here twice in the past week. Once for lunch and once for dinner. Service remains top notch; something you would expect from a much more expensive restaurant. Ahi Tuna Salad is exceptional for lunch. For dinner, I had the Ribs and my wife had the Burger.....both excellent. Consistency is the key here....their standards with both their staff and food are very high. They care, it shows, and wonderful atmosphere also!"}
{"text":"my second time here and no regrets! Took a party of 13 during valentines weekend. Everyone had a great time and treated to great food. Large menu that appealed to everyone. I had the steak cobb salad again which is amazing and very reasonably priced. Others had salmon, prime rib, ribs, parmesean steak and more. Kind of reminds me of cheesecake factory but in a nicer setting. Prices about same or less.  Bar is sooooo gorgeous with upscale scottsdale feel. Highly recommend this place!"}
{"text":"Came here for a dessert only sit down, after the movies.  We had a date night with some friends of ours and were so pleasantly surprised!  It was about 9:00pm and so we had the restaurant to ourselves. We ordered the banana cream pie, bread pudding, rasberry cheesecake and the chocolate cake.  All were amazingly good!  I especially liked the bread pudding.  Make sure you share, their portions are for 2 people.  Needless to say, we took the leftovers home."}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite places in AZ! The Filet Cobb salad is unbelievable...and they even make it to go!"}
{"text":"Eh......for a suburb of metro phoenix it was excellent but i live in central phx where the food is freakin awesome, hard to compete.....perdón."}
{"text":"I have eaten here about 6 times and I have loved every meal. The atmosphere as another review said is elegant and casual. But the food is the best, I've had chicken enchiladas, Rib Eye steak, Hamburger that was to die for, Jambalaya, Mahi, and a few other things that I can't remember. And all the deserts are to die for. This place rocks!"}
{"text":"My fiance and I love coming here as often as we can.  It's also where I proposed to her. All of the food is fantastic. Big fan of the pulled pork sandwich with their delicious lemonade.  The salads are also superb, we've gone through the menu pretty extensively trying a lot of the food. Never disappointed! The only reason I won't give the 5th star is due to our issues with making reservations and having to wait for a pretty length amount of time to be seated for two people. Excellent place overall."}
{"text":"Good flavorful food! Had the Cajun and fillet sandwiches and both we were very happy with both! Service was good overall very happy with this place!"}
{"text":"Sarah is the best!!!! The Brussels sprouts salad is awesome!  The corn salad is awesome.  The French dip is good.  The drinks are good."}
{"text":"Ok, this is one of my favorite type of places - the type where you pick dessert first and then plan your meal accordingly. The service was very attentive and, for the record, my steak was very tasty. In fact, my steak was better than the one I had at bourbon steak during restaurant week and for about half the price.   but, the desserts here are truly the stars of the show. there is a reason the brownie is \"famous\" and the white choc. banana cream pie was wonderful. Seriously, you will want to cuddle with these desserts when you are done."}
{"text":"I've been here a few times with friends and it's always been the same. The service is great, the atmosphere is fine, the food is adequate, and the dessert is definitely a step or two above average...  ...but it's a bad copy of Houston's. And they tend to be very snippy about any sort of comparison with them.  Although, again, if I could rate them differently for their dessert, they would have received possibly 4 stars. It might be a place where a few cocktails over dessert could be quite appealing. But I can't shake the fact that, while the two menus share many similarities, the menu at Houston's is more streamlined and just provides.. more.  It's sadly a forgettable dining experience."}
{"text":"Great food, great service, great prices... The White Chocolate Grill reminded me of Houston's, but with cheaper prices.  I had the prime rib with mashed potatoes.  Cooked perfectly, very tasty.  My wife had the citrus-soy glazed salmon, it was sweet, spicy, savory... very tasty.  For dessert, we tried the apple pie, it was ridiculous.  Our server was excellent, very knowledgeable about the menu and had great suggestions.  Definitely make a reservation!  We will be back."}
{"text":"This restaurant is my favorite of all time. Tonight my dad and I enjoyed two specials that I have never had, the side of spaghetti squash and the pumpkin pie cheesecake as dessert. Both were fantastic and the spaghetti squash is gluten free, which I love. If you are in the area, definitely give this place a try, you cannot go wrong with the ahi tuna salad, the dancing crab cakes, or anything else for that matter."}
{"text":"Met with 3 other college alumni leaders for a working dinner here. Lighting was just right. Posh booths, blonde wood tables. Service was great, have to mention our waiter, \"Kai\" who was attentive and friendly throughout the meal. The seared tuna app was excellent. Served on a porcelain plank upon a bed of delicious fresh cabbage strips that were lightly basted with a tasty dressing. My main plate was broiled scallops. Outstanding large scallops, lined up in a row perfectly done and lightly braised, complimented with an interesting concoction of assorted greens with pine nuts. Dinner companions had different styles of salmon plates, which were all raved about. I don't normally go for after dinner sweet stuff, but did after prodding by my companions.  If you love desserts - I mean really, really awesome desserts - this is your place! Yep. I am looking forward to our next visit to White Chocolate!"}
{"text":"I took my wife there for my anniversary. The service was very good. I had the WCG salad. Best of all was the desert we had the white chocolate brownie. It was great they took reservations."}
{"text":"We like the place but the last few visits we noticed servings are smaller and prices have gone up.... the chicken rib combo is not enough to feed me.... not sure what the restaurant is thinking"}
{"text":"Great for the entire family, great service, Fantastic food. Try the grilled artichoke, man is it great!"}
{"text":"My family of 4 dined here about a week ago, and our experience was wonderful.  From the minute we walked in, we felt welcomed by the friendly smiles at the front desk, all the way to our requested booth (thanks hostesses).  Our server (Chandler) was so sweet and knowledgable.  He made our experience stand out from other restaurants, our glasses were never empty, and he even went out of his way to re-fold our napkins before we got our meals.  Food was excellent.  Will definitely be back, and will ask for Chandler every time!"}
{"text":"We went there two times so far, If you get there right before 6 you just miss the swarm of crowds waiting to get in. The Happy Hour is only in the bar area, where they serve 20 OZ Hefeweizen's and Kilt lifter's as well as some other beers for $4.00 from 2-7pm M-F (I believe, they have a weekend happy hour too if I remember correctly). I did love the rotisserie chicken with the asparagus for the side, My boyfriend ordered the SW chicken salad and The chicken Madeira which he liked both dishes. The first time I got a chicken crepe dish and although it was very good, it was not what I expected. It seemed more like a lasagna style chicken Stroganoff. I think I was expecting something in a crispier crepe style but it was good. I also have to add the Manager went out of his way to find us a table at the bar to be able to enjoy the happy hour specials, despite it being very busy. I was impressed by that!"}
{"text":"I ate here twice this week while I was in Scottsdale on business. I always try to stop at White Chocolate Grill when in Scottsdale. Service is great. Sometimes too fast between courses and I have had to send food back so I could relax between courses. Not sure if they kept it warm or prepared fresh. They always appear to have sufficient staff and they are always busy. Watch the bill as they like to up charge for \"rocks\" in your cocktail even if not ordered straight up. Not a big deal but annoying."}
{"text":"Came here for restaurant week and I very much dug the decor. Especially the wall of bottled spirits. That was kinda kickass and the only thing it was missing was one of those rolling library ladders.  The food itself was alright but nothing mind-blowingly spectacular. For appetizers, we had the chips and spinach artichoke dip which was extremely cheesy and creamy but not overpoweringly so. An excellent appetizer, I must say.  Next was the entree. I ordered the blackened mahi. It was topped with crab meat and tomato creole. Didn't really taste much of the creole sauce but the crab meat was pretty good. The mahi itself was kinda bland and didn't have much flavor. A friend ordered the citrus-glazed soy salmon or something and I had a bite of that and it was pretty good! But on the side, the honey-roasted carrots were super awesome. They were soft, gooey but not mashed gooey, sweet, and just very flavorfull.  And finally dessert, the white chocolate brownie was quite good. Complex in its design and presentation but simple in its taste. But sometimes, simplicity tastes excellent! What we have is essentially a brownie topped with a scoop of vanilla ice cream and ribbon-like shavings of white chocolate. Can't go wrong with that, yeah?  So in the end, I'd give this place a 3.5 stars. The food, while good, wasn't spectacular and my mahi was kinda bland. But the dessert and the decor made up for it and it's a neat little place to take a lady out on a date to. Yay!"}
{"text":"Steak house that cannot cook to the right temp. 3 out of 5 sent back.  Disappointing......"}
{"text":"I ordered the Balsamic Ribeye and it was very good. Definitely not the best I've had, but good none the less. There was a good amount of fat on the steak, which didn't bother me but none the less my waitress hooked me up with a free cheesecake (which please note is definitely for 2 people) and it too was good. I also ordered a side salad, which came with a house dressing that was light and refreshing."}
{"text":"Citrus soy salmon is my favorite. You should try the couscous. Best in town. It's a little noisy but worth the trip. I did my reservation through open table and got on at the time promised. They serve bottomless drinks."}
{"text":"Above average upscale chain.  If you have ever been to a Yard House and enjoyed it you will like the White Chocolate Grill.  Good (if a bit expensive) bar, good service and good food.  Usual selection of sandwiches, salads, fish, chicken and steak to pretty much keep most people happy."}
{"text":"It had been eons since we were at the WCG, but somehow it seemed like a good choice as with our party of four, we all wanted something different and the WCG menu delivered.   First of all, let me proclaim that I was SHOCKED at how busy they were at 5:30 on a Monday night. They must be doing something right.  There was nothing particularly bad about our experience there, but then again, there was nothing that stood out either.    Some of the highlights: My friend had the Famous Grilled Chicken Salad and she was thoroughly delighted by the quality of the chicken. The french fries that accompanied the burgers were thin-cut, crispy, not at all greasy and very tasty. The squash soup was delicious. They managed to cook my salmon on the rare side!  The low lights: My husband's burger was cooked medium instead of medium rare. They didn't serve bread before dinner, but I didn't bother to ask for it either. They cleared plates before everyone was done (my pet peeve). The waiter who brought my cocktail said \"You'll love this one . . . \" It was exactly the opposite for me; I hated it. The mashed potatoes that accompanied my salmon were watery. No one has any real enthusiasm, from the hostesses to our various servers . . . pretty dull.  Not a huge disappointment, but an overall blah experience.  Now I know why I waited so long to go back!"}
{"text":"Great food, great drinks...If you like Houston's, you'll like WCG.  I've had great meals in the dinning room, and great times in the bar as well!"}
{"text":"I've now been to the WCG twice.  The first time I went, I only had a salad.  Only salad has new meaning here as they have some fantastic salads.  In fact, several people at the table said they had never had a salad so wonderful.  I also heard that the seared Ahi was to die for.  Salads were just filler as prelude to desert however.  Everyone at the table ordered something different and they were all passed around.  I can highly recommend the cheesecake and the banana pudding.  Both were outstanding.  On my second visit I tried the Parmesan crusted filet.  It was to die for and I ate way more of it than intended.  I also enjoyed the mashed potatoes and shared someone else's honey roasted carrots.  Tablemates had ribs and the steak sandwich and both had rave reviews.  Overall the service was wonderful, the atmosphere is relaxing and reasonably quiet even when the place is busy.  The food is excellent (I have not heard a bad thing about any dish) and the dessert is worth the trip.  They even list it first on the menu; a sure sign of something great!"}
{"text":"White Chocolate is our go-to place for birthdays and treating out-of-towners to a great meal in a more sophisticated atmosphere. I always order the French Dip, which is stacked high with thin-sliced prime rib and is served with warm and flavorful au jus. My favorite side dish is their beets, though it's a seasonal side that's served infrequently. Sadface. My hubby loves to order the Filet Steak Sandwich. He says the steak is tender, the bread is fresh with a bit of a crunch to contrast with the juiciness of the meat, and the cheese and garlic mayo add creaminess. Their desserts are amazing; you can't go wrong with the White Chocolate Brownie, Banana Cream Pie, or Apple Pie, depending on the flavor profile you are going for.  Service is always top-notch, friendly and knowledgeable about the menu. The atmosphere is great, especially in the bar area. They also have a large patio with abundant seating for those non-100+ degree days/nights."}
{"text":"Date night standard! One of the few restaurants the hubby and I can agree on.  We have visited WCG at least a dozen times and always had a great meal.  Our favorites: filet Cobb, honey carrots, BBQ bacon burger!!!  The only bad thing I've had here is their house margarita, which is made with a mix not fresh lime! Ew"}
{"text":"Picked up a Pumpkin Cheesecake for a Christmas party. Nothing pumpkin about it. Worst  $36 I ever spent. Will not be back."}
{"text":"Nice atmosphere, not too bright. Ate on the patio which was covered and very comfortable at 7pm. Had the blackened mahi with crab sauce. It was really good, tasty and no too heavy. Had an assortment of items on the menu from fancy salads to steaks. All priced reasonably."}
{"text":"I have been to this location many, many time for happy hour and dinner.  This great restaurant never disappoints.  Food and service is always on point.  Happy hour cosmopolitans are delicious. The wait staff is very attentive and will replace your martini glass with a fresh cold one! AZ egg rolls and sliders are our favorite things on the happy hour menu.  Will keep coming back here and recommend to everyone."}
{"text":"Wow! This restaurant was recommended to me a couple of years ago. The Roasted Turkey Sandwich with Mushroom Dip was superb! Since I couldn't stay and eat at the restaurant, I ordered to go. My car smelled wonderful until I reached my destination. The sandwich was still fresh and flavorful 45 minutes after I got it.   They have an extensive menu and everything looked amazing. Definitely will be back when in the area."}
{"text":"Like another reviewer  posted, I submitted a compliant and never heard back. Long story short, I ate at WCG last week and we ordered the grilled artichoke and it had a worm in it. Yes... A worm!!  The manager did try to explain to us as to why and how the worm got in there like that was ok. Oh and he offered to comp the grilled artichoke. You think?! I sure as heck wasn't going to pay for it either way. I felt bad for the people around us eating the same thing. Hopefully those weren't cooked with ours.   When our dinner came, we told him we lost our appetite and they offered to box our dinners up for us so we could take home and eat later. The manager gave us a $25 card which I thought was to use to pay our bill which should have been comp but the waiter came back and said we couldn't use it towards that visit and it was to be used next time. I couldn't believe it. Even the waiter said if it was up to him, he'd let us use or comp our meal. Not the right way to treat a customer that frequents WCG.   WCG should have handled this situation. I've eaten there many times and loved the food but this is unacceptable. You have no problem taking our money but when an issue comes up you don't take care of it. Poor customer service and to not respond to an email to corporate, even worse."}
{"text":"Of all the visits I've made to the grill both in Scottsdale and Denver,I was most dissatisfied with my dininig experience Feb. 8th.  You were out of artichokes, Angostura Bitters and evidently strip steaks.  I ordered the strip and i'm sure it was a top sirloin, both by texture, fascia covering and flavor.  Plus being overcooked.   The banana cream pie, as always, was superb.  Drl J  DVM."}
{"text":"Wonderful place to eat. Not for large parties. Favorite is the Chicken Enchiladas. Service is AAA"}
{"text":"Really good food. Fair prices. Nice decor. Bar area is really nice. Service was solid. Upscale casual in scottsdale"}
{"text":"We came out for Restaurant week to try it out.  They had a great selection with numerous items to choose from or you could just pick off menu.  We were happy with restaurant week choices so went that route.   We had the trio appetizer with guacamole, salsa & cold queso and chips--very good.  Chicken & ribs was perfect although I didn't care for the gravy.  NY Strip steak was tender and juicy.  Dessert was the blonde brownie with ice cream---so good Our server Josh was great, gave us a couple suggests that were spot on.  Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"WOW!! Found this great place on Yelp and was so amazed at how delicious! It had a full Gluten Free menu which is hard to come by in 5 star places. Had 3 kids with us, and they loved it and were treated fabulous. We came in late, at 9:00, with a party of 7, which is a nightmare to most places. We were not rushed and felt so welcome. Highly recommend!!!! Loved it!"}
{"text":"Wow! What a place. Every time we have been, it's been wonderful. Our server was top notch, he actually suggested to not get the Mardi gras rice- instead we got the pumpkin pesto and the ny strip steak is TO DIE FOR! It's a must! Our friends ordered the halibut and the turkey dip... they were not disappointed! Great for family and visitors."}
{"text":"Great dinner choice. Simply delicious food. Great service."}
{"text":"We visited Scottsdale last week and \"this\" is the restaurant we had to come back to before we left!  We didn't make reservations, so luckily we went to the bar to wait for our table where we met our bartenders, Susie and Spenser.  They were so attentive, fun and welcoming that we ordered and ate at the bar.  The drinks were perfect (Mule & Pomegranate Martini) and the recommended chicken enchiladas were wonderful.  On the second time back we also ate at the bar, to engage in more fun conversation with Susie and Spenser and indulged in the key lime pie for dessert (in addition to those enchiladas).  Don't pass on this restaurant.  Also, thanks Susie and Spenser. :)"}
{"text":"May tag burger and the may tag salad are the best! Only thing I find annoying is if you sit in the bar area against the back wall they have these spotlight recessed lighting. If your unfortunate you'll be sitting in one of these seats with a ridiculously bright spotlight shinning down on you it's quiet annoying when your trying to enjoy a meal"}
{"text":"This place is a gem.  They keep things simple and seem to execute flawlessly with great service.  I had the tomato soup and balsamic ribeye and was very pleased with quantity and flavors.  To boot, drinks are quite affordable for N. Scottsdale.  $9 for a martini that was $15 elsewhere."}
{"text":"My cousin and I are very, very bad influences on each other. Fortunately it's rare we're together otherwise I'd be about 20lbs heavier. This week, while both home for the holidays, we set out for one of our signature indulgent meals. White Chocolate Grill's name was like a beacon to us... how can you go wrong with a dinner place named for dessert? This has gotta be delicious and bad for us I figured. Turned out I was right on both counts. We ended up getting the \"date night\" menu... 4 courses for $30 each. Insane amounts of food.   We had: First course - grilled artichokes. best artichokes I've ever had. they're grilled perfectly and sprinkled with Parmesan so full of flavor. Salad course - blue cheese bacon salad. ridiculous. i probably had more calories in this salad than in a normal entire dinner. But hey, when you're going big... Entree - we both got fillet mignon. mine had balsamic mushrooms and you chose a side to go along. the mushrooms were a bit aggressive on the vinegar, otherwise perfectly cooked. Dessert - white chocolate bread pudding with creme anglaise. bring on another obscene dose of fat (it's made with croissants) and tons of sugar. oh so good though.  Quality of food overall was good, but it was really more about having your dessert and eating it too just in terms of everything being full on fat+flavor. If I lived in the area, I'd love to come here for happy hour drinks and apps, and save a full meal for a rare treat, after lots of working out."}
{"text":"these guys have it figured out, we always sit in the bar area, great service, nice facility, food is over the top."}
{"text":"Food was very good. We had the ribs. Thy were cooked perfectly! The arriving duo could have been warmer. My daughters child's meal was freshly made chicken fingers, they were excellent. Service was fast & efficient!"}
{"text":"Service is always excellent. Food is really good and always has great flavor and cooked perfectly.   Check out the White Chocolate Raspberry Cheesecake. 5 Stars. Enough said."}
{"text":"ALWAYS AMAZING!! Service is the best I've ever had, every single time.  Food is consistently delicious.  We'd go here more except there is always a wait on the weekends and we're usually starved.  Call ahead is my tip."}
{"text":"Best consistent restaurant in North Scottsdale. Won't disappoint!!! Apps are amazing and the salads are even better. They have the best fresh fish love the salmon and trout plus there's always something special. Don't forget about the steaks too!!! Best kids menu in town if you have little foodies...."}
{"text":"We had a birthday lunch here for a friend in mid-September (2010).    I adore this place, and went back when my daughter came to town from out of state 2 weeks later.  I just had to have another Portobello Sandwich with Israeli CousCous!  Fabulous item!  My daughter loved her meal too, but I forget what she had.  We split our dinners, and she loved the Portobello too.  Very tasty, and reasonably priced. They had dimmed the lights and it felt like an entirely different restaurant than when I was there for lunch.  Very classy, with great art work.    Lunch was busy the first time I was here, so the service was much slower but that was OK.  Took a long time to get our coffee, must have been some problem with the brewer.  Other than that, I was really impressed and it has quickly turned into one of my favorite restaurants in the area."}
{"text":"This is one of the best business lunch places in Scottsdale. I'm never disappointed when I take clients here.. The service is in point and food is awesome... Happy Hour is a must!!!"}
{"text":"Yup. Super amazing. And Awesome. And all those A words. I had the fish special; it was to die for. Señor had the salmon. I may have had a few bites of his too. It's fine. I'll just run 6 extra miles tomorrow. Grow up .  Come here."}
{"text":"Visited here a couple weeks ago. The food wasn't what I expected. I was expecting well prepared food on the nicer end. This was more like an elephant bar. Now that I know what to expect I won't be as disappointed."}
{"text":"Man this place has a goofy name, but great food.  I have never ordered anything from their menu that wasn't fantastic.  Nothing is rolling off of a Cisco truck here.  All well done and really consistent.  Wait times can be insanity and I have left the restaurant several times due to wait, but the food is excellent.  Try to avoid the typical snowbird crowds at 12-2 and 5:30-6:30, and you should be fine.   Tomato gin soup is stellar.   Famous chicken salad is top notch.   Maytag cheeseburger is worth it every time. Bar is a little loud, but rest of restaurant is booths exclusively."}
{"text":"My wonderful in-laws took me here for a late birthday present. (My birthday was several months ago) I had the fillet topped with blue cheese and it was outstanding!   I've been to this place three times and every time it was nothing but extraordinary.   It is a little pricey but if you have a few extra bucks and are hungry (I always am!) I highly reccomend that you stop by here if you're in the Scottsdale area."}
{"text":"Good food. Great service and they had a decent variety on the menu. Not your typical chain restaurant."}
{"text":"Talk about amazing service! Our server was extremely helpful and prompt. On top of a great staff, the food was divine and I enjoyed every bite. I would highly recommend this place for a date night."}
{"text":"I have been here a few times when visiting my mom. This past weekend the place was empty and were seated right away which was a nice treat.   The interior is dinner appropriate with dark woods and colors plus dim lighting. I wouldn't dine here during the day though. It would put me to sleep after a big meal.  Our waitress was very nice and gave good suggestions.  We started with the Caprese Salad which was tasty. But something wasn't timed correctly in the kitchen and our entrees arrived 3 minutes later. We would up taking 1/2 of the appetizer home.  I was in the mood for something different. In past trips I ate the crab cakes which are good. This time I got their Rotisserie Chicken Crepes. The crepes were filled with spinach and mushrooms & topped with Madeira sauce & parmesan cheese. The spinach was so finely chopped I didn't taste it. It was good. If you like mushrooms you'll like this. I have now had my fill for 6 months.   We managed to find room for a dessert and chose the White Chocolate Brownie with Callebaut Chocolate and French Vanilla Ice cream. It was wonderful!"}
{"text":"My husband & I visited with our parents,  for the most part everyone enjoyed their meal.  My mom's scallops weren't hot upon arrival to the table,  my husband ordered the BBQ combo and found the pulled pork and ribs dry for his liking but he enjoyed the chicken.  I ordered the sea bass and it was too fishy for my taste which is no reflection on the restaurant I should have asked more questions.  Both fathers and my mother in law all enjoyed their meals with no complaints.  We all enjoyed dessert very much.  Our server Michelle was fantastic as well as the rest of the staff who were very attentive and pleasant.  I will bring my husband back  for sure."}
{"text":"So the food was okay nothing was great. Here were my biggest problems, 1st the plates are to big, meaning I ordered the filet and broccoli. The steak is small being a filet and the mashed potato that was supposed to come with it was smaller than the steak. The plate was big and the portion was not, so visually it was disappointing. Second issue was the dessert, we ordered two the first was the brownie and that was great the second was the white chocolate raspberry cheesecake. Here it is, that cheesecake is not a raspberry cheesecake. It is a regular cheesecake with white chocolate shavings and raspberry sauce. That was not what I was expecting."}
{"text":"Great spot for a sandwich. Has an interesting way of being casual but appearing higher class than its derivative Applebee's or Chile's contemporary brethren. Good ingredients, attentive service and very conveniently located off the 101."}
{"text":"My husband and I went here for our anniversary dinner.  We wanted to go somewhere we had never been and we are glad we did.  I ordered the crab cakes and he ordered the balsamic rib-eye.  Both were delicious but my husbands was even better.  We ordered the Caprese salad for the app and it was delicious!  The drinks were great.  I ordered a mojito and my husband got a Glenlivet.  For dessert we had a cappuccino with a shot of amaretto and the white chocolate raspberry cheesecake.  Of course we shared both!  Both were yummy and a great end to a great meal.  We will definitely be back!!"}
{"text":"Enjoyed Sunday lunch here with my mom recently. Menu is exceptional. I had the soy citrus salmon and she had the filet mignon Cobb. Both were amazing. The salmon especially was delicious. They had salmon three different ways on the menu. Plus other fish as well. Service was great. And, of course, the white chocolate bread pudding for dessert is the bomb!"}
{"text":"I LOVE WHITE CHOCOLATE GRILL!!!! It's the perfect combination of consistently excellent food at a fair price, and is a great spot for dinner, lunch, happy hour or brunch.  First time I went to WCG, I actually got food poisoning.  That was 4 years ago and I'm happy to say they have improved.  THE BEST happy hour in town, in my opinion.  My husband and I go regularly, always seem to get a good table in the bar, and have a drink and a meal each for under $30 total.  There is a $7 happy hour menu including sliders and ribs, but I always get just the steamed broccoli ($3) and couscous ($3) with a glass of the Bogle pinor noir ($6 at happy hour).  Seriously, the couscous could possibly be the best thing on the planet.  Big, yummy cous cous grains with pistachios, raisins and just enough dressing to make it tasty but relatively light.  This is not fluffy cous cous, but a cous cous salad. The ahi is wonderful, the steaks are delish, and the chicken sandwich is yummy too.  They do a nice brunch too, and did a fantastic job for my post-wedding brunch for 30.  The patio is NOT air conditioned however, so keep that in mind if you're planning on dining there in the summer (or on a particularly HOT morning in early May).  The servers are all young but relatively professional..friendly without being \"I want to be your FRIEND-ly\".  WCG chef was recently a finaslist on the Regis Philbin show for Top local chef, and that makes me happy. : )"}
{"text":"This is within walking distance of my apartment. Really nice place to eat. I like to eat in the bar section it almost feels like movie theater style as you can sit up higher and still see the TVs. Been there quite a few times it really depends on the waiter or waitress you get sometimes it's amazing service sometimes you hardly see the person. Everything I've eaten there has been  very good,  love the white chocolate brownie! Super good.  Four stars due to sometimes pretty bad service.   But most of the time it's been good."}
{"text":"I would've cleaned out what remained of the three desserts for our table if only my 5 coworkers weren't starting to stare at me like I was a starving yeti.  Desserts: -Seasonal pumpkin cheesecake, very fluffy with a rare naturally fresh pumpkin flavor, one of the best of its kind -French white chocolate bread pudding, loved the spongy texture and the smooth silky blend of sauces drizzled all over -White chocolate brownie, unique and has my stamp of approval as well  Other dishes: -Blackened mahi topped with crab meat and tomato creole sauce, I don't usually like blackened fish but this one was thoroughly enjoyed -Israeli couscous, unexpectedly delicious, and with the aggressive rate at which I fed myself, I might as well have sniffed the couscous grains  Service: -Very good -Our waiter put stars in my eyes after giving us that heavenly pumpkin cheesecake for free since I couldn't decide on a dessert (or 5)"}
{"text":"A disappointing revisit to one of my favorite stops.  The guacamole appetizer is still wonderful, but the filet mignon cobb salad and mardi gras jambalaya were both very average.  The filet mignon was presented as overcooked, chewy nuggets atop the salad and the jambalaya was very bland.  This was not the same great restaurant that I remember."}
{"text":"Wow. Nice place. Good food and prompt service. I had never been here before but heard from friends and colleagues that it's a great place to go. Wife had the Atlantic Salmon and I had the New York Strip Steak. We'll be back for sure!"}
{"text":"We had dinner and the service was hands down fantastic. Kai was our server and bar and helper staff all awesome. I ordered the chicken salad and it was delicious!! My husband ordered the jambalaya and that was not great (over cooked) but everything else was fantastic including the white brownie dessert. Super yum and we will definitely come again!! Thank you!!!"}
{"text":"A while back I had 2 really good friends of mine visiting from Maryland.  Neither one of them are into Southwest Dishes that much or Mexican food either so I had to find a place with good seafood ... besides Pappadeaux.  We've dined at Pappadeaux more times than I can count with both hands so I wanted to try something different while they came to visit.  They were staying in Scottsdale during their visit and didn't want any of the fancy steakhouses in the area.  They wanted something they'd only get in Arizona so thanks to Yelp, I found White Chocolate Grill.   It was 3 of us dining on a Friday night.  There was a small wait, super small.  We decided to grab a cocktail in the bar while we waited with our little buzzer to go off.  2 sips in the buzzer went off and it was time to be seated.  There weren't any appetizers on the menu that we were intrigued by so we skipped appetizers and went straight to the entrees.  I'm originally from Baltimore, Maryland.  I could eat Crab Cakes every single day.  I usually do not try crab cakes outside of Maryland because well .... No one makes crab cakes like Marylanders.  The server convinced me that White Chocolate Grill's Maryland style crab cakes were a good replica.  The server was completed true!!   I ordered The Dancing Crab Cake - Maryland Style with mashed potatoes.  They were soooooo good!  They were lightly breaded, did NOT contain green or red peppers (I'm not sure why folks outside of Maryland add peppers to their crab cakes), and I really wanna believe they were seasoned with Maryland style Old Bay.  I could be wrong but man ... they were really good!  My other friend ordered Blackened Sea Bass with crab meat with mashed potatoes.  Great!  Super tasty!  My other friend ordered Salmon New Orleans - Blackened with shrimp and crab sauce w/ Mardi Gras Rice.  This was pretty tasty too but I must say Pappadeaux took the cake on that one.    For dessert, we all shared the White Chocolate Brownie.  Scrumptious!  It was warm, white chocolate-y and the vanilla ice cream was a nice touch.  I highly recommend White Chocolate grill for a nice dinner.  I'd suggest you make reservations first."}
{"text":"Disappointing. Arrived at 2 PM on Friday 9/22. The Male host was unfriendly and put off some major attitude when we asked not to be seated in the middle of a family in the bar area that had six tables. The rest of the bar tables were empty... We ended up moving up to the bar when our drinks weren't brought out after 15 minutes. (Beer and a water). Female bartender was very friendly and attentive. BBQ burger smelled like mold and was over cooked, chicken sandwich was just okay. This place has been great in the past, but it appears to be slipping fast. Won't go back anytime soon."}
{"text":"So our waitress at Durants told us that this is another good spot to try. She was a pretty awesome waitress so the lady and I decided we would try it out.   It was indeed another good spot.   The waiter guy was a bit of a douche as he kept staring at my girlfriends breasts most of the time. However even though she said she was dressed the way she was because it \"was so hot out\" I believe she likes the attention. ;)   That being said the food was really good. We started withe the Ahi and I also had the Mahi Mahi. Now I don't think I've had this much seafood in the middle of the desert( except Vegas) which made me wary. I was worried for nothing. Both dishes came out superb. Perfectly cooked the Mahi was nice and flaky and the Ahi was very fresh.   The girl had something they called the famous chicken salad and she said it was awesome. I have to believe her as she rarely finishes a dish and she sucked this up like it was the last bag of potato chips at a Cypress Hill concert.   If I come back to AZ ( Better be in freaking December too damn hot out here) i will return."}
{"text":"I like this place because it has a variety of a menu and the food is pretty decent. It reminds me of a nicer yard house. I had Ahi salad And it was bomb. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"My sister and I go here for the dessert...so that is where i am going to start...the white chocolate breadpudding OMG OMG OMG!!!!  It is fabulous and the blond brownie with chocolate sauce AWWWWWWW i think I just had an orgasm!! I love how they say the desserts are for two, but my sister and I always split two so we are each eating two desserts!! ITS AWESOME!!!   Now the food is wonderful too...I got the blu burger and the gin tomato soup...delicious!!!!!  I love it here...i love the atmosphere and the food and the staff...its a perfect combo of deliciousness!!!"}
{"text":"Second visit to WC confirms my four star review.  Tried the stacked enchiladas and they cured a little Tex-Mex craving.  Magarita sealed the deal for a very enjoyable meal.  Service was very good, and everyone walked away happy and with to-go boxes.  That being said, if their desserts were better I would probably give it another star."}
{"text":"White Chocolate Grill sounds like my imaginary dream land from when I was a child, and the name of the restaurant lives up to everything in my dreams! My family and I had dinner here last week before the holiday and we all left happy and with clean plates!  The drink menu is extensive and fun; I had the dragon berry lemonade. Then as a meal I had my usual scallops with couscous. The scallops were cooked perfectly with a delicious sauce. I loved the couscous; it was cold and had a different play on your average couscous but it was the good kind of different! I especially loved the added pistachios to the mix!  While we had an amazing dinner, I also need to applaud the service at White Chocolate Grill. From the moment we walked in to the moment we left, we were served by happy and helpful waitresses and hostesses. Anything we needed, they were there!  There is clearly a reason it is hard to get a reseravation at White Chocolate Grill. Call now- dont miss out!"}
{"text":"Came here for dessert only, one evening. And it was SUPERB! Tried the apple pie and raspberry cheesecake. They were both delicious. I don't know which one is better. I would consider going back to try their regular food if the dessert is that good!"}
{"text":"Everything was exceptional- the food, the service, the atmosphere, so on point. We were celebrating some great news, and we picked the perfect spot! Enjoyed a full 3-course meal with adult beverages, and the experience far exceeded the cost. Highly recommend if you're looking for a truly special night."}
{"text":"Had a company paid-for lunch here and thoroughly enjoyed it!  They have some pretty great food. I got the crab cakes and loved all of it. Portions for this dish were great -- was satisfied and didn't feel the need to eat more. However, would say some of the dishes my colleagues ordered did seem like too much food. But I guess worth the price, right?  We also got an assortment of desserts and would definitely recommend getting them. My favorite was the bread pudding and this was recommended to us by the waiter!  Also would love to comment on their wonderful service! Unsure the name of the waiter we had, but they were great!"}
{"text":"This food is great and service is great! Came to celebrate daughters birthday and they do not offer a complimentary desert. Frequent many restaurants and have never had  any of them charge me for a birthday desert. I brought 4 people that would not have been there if not to celebrate the birthday."}
{"text":"I look forward to eating at this establishment every time I come to town. With it's dark wood, plush booths and open kitchen, the ambiance is set for a special meal. The menu is large but easy to navigate and is always fun to try a little of everyone's dish. The daily specials are thoughtful and seasonal and they have no problem altering an item for a guest with dietary restrictions. The brussel sprouts are excellent as well as the spaghetti squash casserole that I ordered last visit which had a distinct flavor and crunch with the addition of the pistachios. The coconut-steak-a must try as the sauce is so rich and it compliments the beef beautifully. The service is always superb and I look forward to my next trip to Phoenix..."}
{"text":"Food was great. The crab cakes are the BEST I've tasted. Only the bottom of a huge pile of crab meat was breaded to keep the shape. The crab was sooooo tasty and not ruined with heavy sauces. This is our 4th time there in 2 months and have been consistently impressed by everyone from greeter on the way in to greeter saying good night as we leave. The only reason for 4 stars is the noise level is very high. Guess it's a eat, pay, get out philosophy although we were never rushed."}
{"text":"Okay...so this is my second time there and my second review.  the first one was not so good and in all fairness I was contacted by someone from the white chocolate grill and they sent me a $25.00 gift card apologizing for my past experience and asked me to give them another try.  i found this to be quite refreshing and it says a lot about a place when they try to make things right!  So, with that being said..off we ventured to give it another try!  From the moment we arrived we were greeted by the hostess who sat us promptly and informed as that Tara would be our server.  from the time it too Tara to reach us ( about 10 minutes) we were helped by the busser who made sure that we had drinks, etc.  this time here our water glasses were refreshed constantly and the service was very attentive.  My wife and I both ordered the date night out special which you had choices of an appetizer, salad, entree, and desert all for 28.99!  Was a lot of food, but a really great deal.  The food this time was decent as well except the steak could have been seasoned a little bit more.  I must say that they did a great job this time and I am glad that I got the chance to go back and have them make it right!  I will continue to come here in the future because of that effort of theirs alone!"}
{"text":"We enjoyed our meal very much.    My daughter got the ribs and they were tender and falling off the bone.   The summer corn salad as a side dish is perfect for summer in Arizona.   I got the glazed salmon and it was cooked perfectly and the cucumbers on top were delicious.   My only complaint is that we ask for rolls and when they came to the table they were very hard and not warm.   Besides that everything was delicious and the service was great"}
{"text":"We love this place.  Each year we come to Scottsdale for a week and always eat here.  We have had a full dinner but most times we eat in the bar for happy hour; it's t from 2PM until 6PM and you can make a reservation for the bar area as well as dining.   The menu is limited to 4 or 5 items but how about a  1/2 rack of baby-back ribs and fries for $8.99 and 3 pork sliders and fries for $6.99;  it's perfect.  The happy hours drinks are the usual Cosmo's, etc so if you want a scotch or something of that sort expect to pay about $10 for a moderate priced brand like Dewar's.  Love this place.  The staff is friendly and the restaurant and the bar nicely appointed."}
{"text":"Came here on new years eve because I wanted to see their gluten free menu. Im newly diagnosed with celiac disease so Ive been on the hunt for places to eat.  I tried their GF grilled artichokes and holy crap were they delicious. Seasoned well with a yummy aioli sauce. Seriously would make a trip way the hell up north just to eat those again.  For my entree I had the GF burger. Unfortunately, it was just a burger with no bun, I was kind of hoping it would either be wrapped in lettuce or they would have a GF bread. But, it was good. Their french fries have so much potential, they were shoestring and cooked perfectly, but had almost no seasoning. All they need to do is throw a little seasoning on those puppies and they would be fantastic.   Service and management were really great. They gave us a free dessert (GF souffle) because we had a little incident with another patron. It had nothing to do with them, but they apologized for it and gave us the dessert, which I thought was really nice. And the fact that they remembered I was doing the GF thing was really cool.   I would definitely go here again and they had a fairly decent size gluten free menu if you need it. :)  TVs in the bar area."}
{"text":"Upon entering White Chocolate Grill, it's immediately apparent that they've tried to recreate the decor and atmosphere of Houston's which simply invites customers to compare their experience to a comparable dinner at the restaurant that they are attempting to emulate.  Perusing the menu confirms this as there are many of the same items listed.  Unfortunately, however, the food quality and wine list do not compare to Houston's and I would have gladly paid the extra $50 to have simply dined there.  At 8:45 on a Saturday night, we arrived to find almost no other customers dining.  We ordered the tortilla soup, Caesar salad, and veggie burger, all items that we've had before at Houston's.  The soup was flavorful, but not as good, the salad was glopped with a heavy Caesar dressing (it's counterpart at Houston's is light and eggless), the veggie burger was good, but nothing that would bring us rushing back.  A positive, however, is that we did get a side of mashed potatoes with the veggie burger which was very good and is an item not offered at Houston's.  All in all, this appears to be an example of a situation in which the original is just better in all regards than a knock-off. Our meal wasn't terrible, but just not nearly as good.  Next time, we will drive a few extra miles south and head to Houston's."}
{"text":"I'm definitely a fan of this restaurant. I have heard of this place back when i lived near Chicago and was never able to go. I had a couple of girlfriends in town and we went the other week. The service was great (ask for Cody if you can). I had the stack of ribs (which I was hesitant on) but was the best decision ever. Great night and great food...GO THERE!"}
{"text":"love the atmosphere, bar setup and HH specials were good.  great pomegranate martini.  unfortunately, no vegetarian choice for HH appetizers except chips and salsa.  they couldn't apparently take the chicken out out of their roll.  had the spinach/artichoke dip/chips and was fantastic!    unfortunately no wifi access.  bad move :(:("}
{"text":"Great find for Arizona!  Food was great!  Service was great!  We loved our waitress...  Ask for Susie!  The Citrus Glazed Salmon was cooked correctly and tastefully."}
{"text":"We eat there at least once a month. Love eating in the bar. I always get the white Chocolat special salad, excellent ..... service is always top notch"}
{"text":"I have heard so many raving reviews about the food here. Heard the salads are to die for. We tried it the other night. The steak sandwiches were excellent. Very fresh ingredients. Service was excellent but had one suggestion for them. We were still eating our appetizer and were asked 3-4 times by different staff if we were done while they were pulling the dish away from us. Hands on the dish pulling it away. Continued asking way too many times if we were done with our entrees when we still had plenty of food on it. It wasn't one staff member it was all. All different people not just our waitress. We spent the majority of our dinner saying no we weren't done yet. Constantly interrupting us. I was still eating my entree and got tired of the constant asking so I eventually told them to take it. I wish there was a do not disturb sign we could have put up."}
{"text":"This restaurant has a great menu .... we couldn't decide.   The spit roasted turkey dip was amazing, the jambalaya, the enchiladas .... all excellent.  Their freshly mashed potatoes were really good but I didn't care for their signature gravy.  Drinks were fun and good.  Service great but checking tables for where you are in dinner service got annoying and made you feel rushed.  Manager making rounds was totally superficial.  We will definitely be back though."}
{"text":"I had a business dinner here during a conference a couple of months ago and enjoyed the food and atmosphere immensely. The two of us wanted to try everything, so we shared. We got the two specials: spaghetti squash with garlic butter & roasted pistachios and the blackened Ono. Both were beautiful and delicious. We also shared the cheeseburger. I noticed that they grind the meat in-house. It was simply one of the best burgers I've ever eaten. I would definitely go back for that alone!  Add the French White Chocolate Bread Pudding and we were on cloud nine. Great value for the price."}
{"text":"Hey hey my Az peeps this place never disappoints . From beginning to end service and food was impeccable . Make sure you all save room for dessert .... you will want to share their White Chocolate Brownie, \"it's to die for \""}
{"text":"Don't get me wrong, I've been to WCG many times. I've gone for date nights, family gatherings, etc., but after my most recent visit I feel posed to finally write a review. Now, it's not that WCG wasn't worthy of a review, it's just I normally don't write reviews for chain restaurants, but I am making an exception because I REALLY like their food and service.   So, my favorite things to get here are their salads. I've had most of them besides the Tuna one and each one is fresh with quality ingredients that alone are standouts. The cajun chicken sandwich is amazing as are the crepes. The desserts are great- I judge a dessert on whether or not it is served warm (if it should be) and this place passes the test with flying colors.   The service is great- in fact one time we got a free dessert because dinner took \"too long\" to get to us- the thing was we didn't even complain, nor did we think it was taking long... of course I will take a free dessert though! Reservations are a must and sometimes you will still have to wait, but for a good standby for a nice occasion, WCG is the place to go!"}
{"text":"Very disappointed. We were there to celebrate a 70th birthday.  When we walked in, we were very impressed by the ambiance.  We sat down and ordered a couple of drinks.  Dinner consisted of splitting a caprese salad and the prime rib for two.  Was disappointed that they didn't serve baked potatoes but instead only had mashed with gravy?  The rib is in an au jus so I don't know why they'd serve it with spuds and gravy.  Anyway, after waiting quite a while (we arrived for our reservation at 5:00 p.m.) we were suddenly presented with our dinner.  Ooopsey!  Forgot the salad and so we waived off our dinner and the caprese showed up which was standard.  Then while dining on the salad, our dinner was presented once again and we waived it off a second time indicating that it better not be sitting under a heat lamp while we were finishing our salads.  But that's exactly what happened.  When the meal finally arrived, the potatoes were lukewarm as was the prime rib. and needless to say overdone.  My piece was gross.  It had a huge bone and was surrounded by an enormous amount of fat.  I was lucky to get 4 bites out of $28.99 rib.  My husband's was ok and he ate it because at that point we were famished.  Oh, by the way, don't bother with the rolls.  They were hard and tasted more than a day old.  I was so disappointed for my husband since this was a very special occasion and I wanted to surprise him with a great place for dinner.  I told the young waitress that when she turns 70, hopefully she'll celebrate hers at a much better place."}
{"text":"Let me just start by saying OMG!!! My hubby and I were in the neighborhood and came here for lunch. walking up to the place you see a huge outdoor covered patio with big cushy chairs and huge fireplace. Great place to chill while waiting in the cooler AZ months (they also have a huge dining patio on the back of the building with an even bigger fireplace). Upon walking in the front door, there are lit rock walls with dark wood through out. To your right is the bar with a floor to ceiling liquor wall that is lit from behind making the whole wall glow with booze!! It's very eye catching. The seats in the bar area are quite unique too, all half booths which face the wall o' booze and a few large flat screen tv's, it's also teared like stadium seating. We sat in the main dining room just to the left of the bar. It was a very upscale, yet chill/cozy atmosphere.  throughout the main dining area are mostly all cozy booths and half booths. the lighting is dim but not so dim that you can't see your hand in front of your face or so dim you can't read the menu. The wait staff is very friendly, accommodating, and efficient. The prices, are actually quite decent. I didn't see anything on the lunch or dinner menu that was a break the bank kind of price. Since we were there for lunch, we just had a sandwich and salad. My hubby got the French Dip. I know that sounds average and boring, but it was the best looking and best tasting french dip i think I've ever had and my hubby said the same thing! It was freshly sliced roast beef, like prime rib sliced thin on a french baguette. The meat was buttery soft and melted in your mouth. I just had a salad, their Southern chicken salad. it was HUGE! It's a salad, not much to say with that other than it was also very good. The most awesome part of our dinning experience was dessert!! this is a place you go to where you NEED to save room for their desserts! We split the White Chocolate Brownie. This thing was a meal in itself! the brownie had to be at least 3 or 4 inches square then topped with vanilla ice cream and white chocolate shavings. When the brought it out it had to have stood about a foot tall! We devoured it! how we had room for that is anybodies guess. It's very rich and decadent and you can bes' believe I was at the gym for a loooong time to work that off my waist! So well worth every single calorie!! I'd say this is a great date night spot! Can't wait to get back up there to enjoy their dinner menu and another over-the-top dessert!!!"}
{"text":"Service was excellent and the atmosphere was pleasant, but the food cannot be recommended.  Filet was thin, dry and not particularly flavorful, and the broccoli side was over cooked.  My wife's crab cakes had nice large pieces of meat, but seemed a bit old.  There are must better choices near by."}
{"text":"I have eaten here several times most recently about a month ago.  They occasionally have a Pulled Pork Sandwich Special that is one of the best sandwiches of this type that I have ever had and that's saying a lot coming from an Iowa Hog Farmer.  IT SHOULD BE ON THE MENU THAT MIGHT GET UM 5 STARS.  Kinda funny but last time I was there we were sitting by the bar and the waiter accidentally hit the wall with the plate and dropped the hot sandwich on my leg and the floor.  I damn near chewed my leg off.  HaHa.  You could tell he was very embarrassed but there was no way I was leaving until I finished my delicious treat.  So I simply cleaned myself off and waited for the replacement.  The atmosphere is casual comfortable and dressy all at once so thats cool.  Great place to bring your significant other.  Highly Recommended."}
{"text":"My husband and I ate here for Restaurant week, and we were VERY happy that we did! It was definitely the best place we went all week, and we will be back! Sean was our server, and he went above and beyond to make sure that we had a great experience. I had the salmon, my husband had the steak, and both were great! I should have gone with Sean's suggestion for the side of carrots, but chose my own, the mashed potatoes. They were okay, not amazing, but I guess not everything can be!   We will be back, and hopefully get Sean as our server again. He made the dinner a very good and memorable one!"}
{"text":"This is one of our favorite places to eat. Great selection and very high quality food, without super expensive prices.  The white chocolate brownie dessert is a MUST have.  The cocktails are also well-made."}
{"text":"Made reservations via Yelp app and was pleased to be seated immediately when we arrived, it was really busy! Menu had a lot of great options, something for everyone. Our waiter was amazing, super friendly!   I ordered the rotisserie chicken, hubby ordered the filet salad, mother in law ordered chicken Milanese and 8 year old ordered ribs. Everything came pretty quickly. By the time the 3 adults tried our dishes and looked over, my 8 year old had devoured all his ribs. They were apparently amazing. Everyone else's dishes were pretty good. Could complain. Mother in law said hers was amazing.   We would definitely come back and try some other dishes...really want to try the quinoa burger."}
{"text":"Short and sweet. Great food with lots of variety. Great atmosphere. And fantastic service. Their attention to detail and to customer service is the best. Don't pass up a chance to try this place. Once you do you will be back again and again."}
{"text":"Husband ordered jambalaya and I had their signature chicken salad. Both fantastic. My cousin ordered barbecue trio and split with his girlfriend - more than enough to share and they said it was fantastic"}
{"text":"This place stole the show as far as steakhouses I've tried here. After getting done with the school campus visit, my buddy and I came here for some much needed food. He's lived in Phoenix before, and recommended this place. We came here in the late afternoon, and thankfully there were not too many people. For an appetizer, I ordered the artichoke with dip. It was pretty good, and the Parmesan cheese added a good kick of flavor. For the main course, I ordered their salmon plate with mardi gras rice. The salmon tasted above and beyond delicious, as did the rice was pretty good too. I was very impressed by the quality of food here. My buddy had a plate of grilled chicken, ribs, and shredded pork. I don't eat pork, but I did try the chicken. I can tell it was good quality. The staff here is super friendly, and they are very attentive. I am impressed by their service, and I hope they open house in the Los Angeles area."}
{"text":"Good food assisted by great servers.  Try the bread pudding dessert which is In my all time top three."}
{"text":"This is one of my all time favorite restaurants in Phoenix. Even though I prefer local mom and pop places to chains this chain does it right. The service is always impeccable, the drinks are strong and delicious. They make the best prime rib sandwich in town and the filet mignonette salad is delicious as well. The white chocolate raspberry cheesecake is sinfully good and two can barely finish it....but we do because it is so good."}
{"text":"This place serves the best French Dip I have ever had. Their other food is also delicious but the French Dip is carved prime rib still pink and not over cooked. When we lived in Scottsdale my husband and I went here for lunch often and now when I visit I try to go as often as possible."}
{"text":"Overall nice restaurant with great ambiance. Great spot for birthday celebrations with family. The food is above average but the desserts are 5 star!"}
{"text":"Visiting from Seattle & first time at this restaurant on the recommendation of a friend. It was a busy Saturday but was able to snag a 730pm reservation. We were a party of six and got seated on time. Our waitress was amazing, the food was very good. Hubby had the filet mignon Cobb salad and I had the French dip -- we both would have it again. The dessert was to die for- of course there were white chocolate specials but we opted for the dark chocolate soufflé- yum!! We loved it so much we're going back again before we head home. Definitely will recommend to friends who plan to visit the area."}
{"text":"Five stars for the roasted turkey sandwich and white chocolate blonde brownie. Great waitstaff."}
{"text":"Went to this place with my best friend from college who considers it his favorite restaurant and was not disappointed. It's a really awesome dark-lit venue serving American-style food and a decent list of cocktails and wine. I had a New York in a mushroom sauce that came out amazingly, but as a fan of blue rare steak, I didn't get to experience the steak fully since it was covered in sauce. I wish I would have known before.   Service is great and the staff is very friendly. I was a bit disappointed with the cocktails, however. The Old Fashioned they serve could absolutely do without the splash of lime soda or whatever carbonated item they add. It does not make the drink too enjoyable.   In all, if you want a great dinner or a spot to have a fun date, this definitely is worth it."}
{"text":"Service was excellent,  tomato soup with gin was incredible and the white chocolate banana cream pie was out of this world!"}
{"text":"Great place for dine-in and pick-up!  Ambience: Contemporary/ Casual  Food/Drink: American.  Good salads and desserts!"}
{"text":"My anniversary restaurant. I always start dinner with a white chocolate martini and they are good and strong here. Everything you order will taste out of this world. We started with the chicken tortilla soup  and a side salad . BOTH DELICIOUS. My boyfriend had a steak and I had a smokehouse bacon BBQ cheeseburger and guuuuurl let me tell you...I LOVE this thing. But make sure you save room for dessert. We had the white chocolate brownie with shavings of white chocolate and the cheesecake with strawberry or raspberry sauce over the top. I will be thinking of this meal until my next anniversary. This pace is a must do."}
{"text":"We went for lunch and got there just in time to beat the business crowd. This was by far one of the best lunches I've had in a long time. Hands down, THE BEST service I've ever gotten!! The wait staff run like a well tuned machine!! Drinks always filled, plates taken away immediately, and constantly checking in on us. Now... to get to the food. The 3 of us ended up sharing because it was all soooo good. We got the Spit Roasted Turkey Sandwich with mushroom dipping gravy, the Filet Steak Sandwich,and the Rotisserie Chicken Crepes. Very filling but there was no way we were leaving without dessert. Our picks were the banana cream pie(oh my), the moist chocolate soufflé cake(delightful), and the Key Lime Pie(heavenly)!!! The desserts are more than big enough to share(we didn't see that it said desserts for 2), but we managed to eat most of it. I can't decide what was better, the food or the service. We waddled out of the place like happy little piglets."}
{"text":"The food was absolutely fantastic ,nice crisp  Wedge salad, blue cheese filet, balsamic ribeye, couscous,and mashed potatoes, White chocolate,brownie and fantastic drinks, nice and strong very tasty and perfectly potent, The food and wait staff were absolutely perfect"}
{"text":"The name of the restaurant intrigued me and so I gave it a try to see what it was all about.  We've been here four times and even brought out of town guests here who also enjoyed the place.  A few things that we've tried so far:  Fresh guacamole- served with warm tortilla chips and a side of salsa. The guacamole was definitely made fresh as you can tell from the taste and color. The tortilla chips are light and crisp and works very nicely with the creamy guacamole. We liked it so much we ordered this again.   Four Cheese Spinach & Artichoke Dip- served with warm tortilla chips. This is one of their more popular appetizers so I gave it try.  Maybe it was an off day when I ordered it, I found it very salty...probably won't order this again.  WCG Bacon Blue Cheese Salad- assorted mixed greens, blue cheese bits, bacon, candied nuts and red onion with a light vinagrette. I ordered this as a side salad and I was actually pleasantly surprised how great this tasted. Yum!  Fish of the day- Steelhead trout with herb sauce and fried shrimp with a side of vegetables.  I ordered this and was surprised that the trout tasted and looked a lot like salmon. The waiter mentioned that this particular trout had a similar lifestyle as it swam from the ocean to the river to spawn.  There was a creamy herbal sauce and a smattering of crispy fried shrimp on top.  http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/UE3AvVnaPEBPneVahYT2eA?select=tF2C4TMHcohGdMiZ3EEIcw#FNWVAqP8NlvZ4Hm1TIR5Rg  Balsamic Ribeye - ribeye that is infused with balsamic vinegar and grilled. This was an item that one of the waiters recommended on our second visit. He recognized and welcomed us back again. This is a nice option for a twist on regular grilled steak. The balsamic vinegar has a nice tang and sweetness to it as it is caramelized over an open fire.  http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/UE3AvVnaPEBPneVahYT2eA?select=tF2C4TMHcohGdMiZ3EEIcw#tRk182jI0MgeSm8WpHz4pg  Rotisserie Chicken Crepes - crepes filled with spinach and mushrooms & topped with Madeira sauce & parmesan cheese. I ordered this the 2nd time we went to WCG. It sounded interesting and I decided to give it a try. I would give it a 3 out of 5.  Maybe it was the parmesan cheese but the sauce was too salty for my liking. It wasn't so bad that I would send it back, but I probably wouldn't be inclined to order it again anytime soon.  Prime Rib-slow roasted with au jus. Delicious! They have prime rib after 4 pm and I think on holidays as I well. We went again on Father's Day and the waiter mentioned that they will be serving prime rib all day.  http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/UE3AvVnaPEBPneVahYT2eA?select=tF2C4TMHcohGdMiZ3EEIcw#VpmZd5AfZmF4vExYIM_dow  Save room as their desserts are quite good.  White Chocolate Banana Cream Pie- the banana cream was smooth and creamy and there were slices of banana and ribbons of white chocolate on top. However, the best part was the graham cracker and granola crust. Highly recommend this dessert!  http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/UE3AvVnaPEBPneVahYT2eA?select=tF2C4TMHcohGdMiZ3EEIcw#vy0bhfeJMAHo4pfvpTZ_YA  White Chocolate Raspberry Cheesecake - the cheesecake was a generous piece and was drizzled with raspberry sauce and caramel sauce. This was probably one of the best cheesecake I've had in a while. It doesn't compare the cheesecake from the \"Cheesecake factory.\" This cheesecake was silky smooth, creamy and surprisingly not very sweet. Highly recommend this dessert too! lol.  Freshly Baked Apple Pie a la mode- the waiter told us that this dessert takes about 10-15 minutes as they need to bake the crust and since we weren't in a hurry we waited. Sliced apples sprinkled with cinnamon filled a round flaky pastry and there was a scoop of vanilla ice cream and was drizzled with caramel sauce.  This was pretty good dessert if you like something similar to an apple tart.  Regarding the waitstaff Devin was great. He was attentive but not intrusive. However, on Father's day for lunch, another waiter who served us was less experienced and less attentive. It wasn't particularly busy that day either, maybe he was new and in training.    My friend and I both ordered the balsamic ribeye on Father's Day. She ordered her's medium but when it came out, it was more like well done. We mentioned it to our waiter and he promptly brought it back to the kitchen. In about 10 minutes or so, I think it was the manager who brought the entree to my friend. He asked her to cut into the steak to make sure it was cooked properly and it was.  I would definitely call ahead to make a reservation as this place does get busy."}
{"text":"We went to dinner here on a Sunday night with my in-laws who frequent this restaurant.  Our service was bad, they waited over 10 minutes for their alcoholic drinks.  My husband and father in-law had the Perfect Salmon which smelled very fishy for Salmon and he could taste a strong fishy flavor.  He also ordered a salad with Vinaigrette dressing and the dressing tasted bad and he couldn't even it.  I had the Parmesan crusted steak which was mediocre.  To top the experience off, there was no toilet paper in the women's restroom and it was a mess with toilet liners on the floor in the stall."}
{"text":"Our server this evening was a lovely young lady named Swayze. She was fun and attentive. Our meal was incredible. Of course the desserts were pure heaven. What surprised was everything that came before. From the Frisky Whiskey cocktail which was so delicious it was dangerous to a perfectly prepared prime rib, every aspect of the meal was heaven. If we were locals, we would be back often!"}
{"text":"The most delicious steaks ever!! Totally worth the prices. The atmosphere is perfect for a date night. Love everything about this place. No complaints!"}
{"text":"I never thought much of this place from the outside but the inside is really well done. I will keep this short and simple.. their happy hour is great and you MUST try the ribs. You get a half rack (which was a huge half rack) and fries for $6.99. The meat falls off the bone and it is tender and juicy with a sauce that is incredible. I also enjoyed the $6 martini.  You can get 20 oz beers for $4 as well. I will be going back to try a  full meal next time."}
{"text":"We have dined here many times, mostly in the bar, and the food is always great with good service and friendly service with big smiles. Love their salads, though my favorite the Ahi salad has shrunk  in size a little. The carrot side is simple but excellent as is my latest surprise the couscous side. My wife ordered it and we were both fighting for bites!  After a long day of travel landing at PHX, we stop in here every chance we get. There is not a weak link on their menu."}
{"text":"Just don't bother...  Had dinner here last night for my birthday because apparently several of my husband's coworkers highly recommended this place. I'm not sure what food they're used to that they consider this good, but I certainly did not. The highlight of our meal was the appetizer and the vegetable of the day. Other than that, it was barely edible.   Starting with drinks, I had a pear martini and hubby had a Long Island iced tea. The martini was thick and excessively sweet. Tasted like cheap pancake syrup. The Long Island was standard, nothing great but not bad. Though I would suggest a different glass or maybe a different colored straw, because halfway through our meal someone walked by (not our waiter) and topped it off with regular iced tea before we could even say anything.  For an appetizer we ordered the shrimp cocktail. I'd say this is pretty hard to mess up, but what made it really great were the sauces. It came with cocktail sauce as well as a jalapeño sauce. They were both fantastic! I assumed they were made in house, but I guess it's quite possible that the 1 thing we liked wasn't even made in the restaurant.   For dinner I ordered scallops (not on the menu, they were a special) with the vegetable of the day, and hubby had the BBQ trio with fries.   My scallops were awful. They came atop a lemon beurre blanc.  Both the sauce and the scallops were cold, they were missing the beautiful sear that I expect to see on scallops, and they were undercooked (still slimy in the middle). The vegetable of the day was a corn salad. That was the only good thing on the plate. It had corn, tomatoes, zucchini and queso fresco and it was delicious. I plan to make it at home.  Hubby's BBQ trio was nothing special. It had pulled pork, ribs, and rotisserie chicken. The meats were cooked well, the problem was the BBQ sauce was sugary sweet. Not really to our liking. The side of fries was the worst part of the dish. The menu touts fresh cut fries, well let me tell you, what we got was a soggy, greasy pile of junk. They didn't even look appetizing. I wish I had gotten a picture of them just to see how many people might actually be willing to eat them. I'm sure not many.   As far as decor goes, if you've ever been in a Firebirds, you've seen the inside of this place. Everything from the dark wood, to the open kitchen, to the back-lit liquor bottles at the bar. It's all the same. And the food at Firebirds is much better.   The one positive I can speak to (and the only reason for giving 2 stars instead of 1) was the service. We had a reservation and we were seated very quickly even though we arrived 20 mins early. And our waiter was very attentive and friendly.   Unfortunately, the food was so bad I don't expect to ever be back."}
{"text":"Not good they try, but the BBQ Trio is a Dennys Dinner~!! Great service and friendly people.... the end~"}
{"text":"This restaurant has the fantastic customer service and delicious food. Our waitress, Susan was very patient and had suggestions. We shared a bacon bleu cheese salad and a pulled pork sandwich with a side of French fries. Both delicious. I would recommend both. For dessert, we had white chocolate brownie. That is a must have since it is called White Chocolate Grill! Our bill was about the same for what we pay at a casual restaurant in Tempe, FYI. Definitely recommend this place!"}
{"text":"We had a party of 3 and we all very much enjoyed the experience.  We were there on a Saturday evening without reservations.  We waited in the bar for maybe 30 to 45 minutes and the time went fast. We were seated in a booth and liked our location. The food was excellent.  I had ribs and was very satisfied.  The other two people gave their items rave reviews.  We talked and laughed and had a great time.  Our waiter was average but didn't wreck anything. The ambiance was very nice.  The food was very good.  The experience was enjoyable and memorable.  I would definitely return!"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I received a gift card from a friend so we decided to dine last night.   The server was very sweet but lacked professionalism and experience.   I ordered the Dragonberry Lemonade and the server had to come back and tell me they were out of the Dragonberry rum. I picked another drink - but... I have to say, I work for 8 restaurants in food and beverage at a resort and in no way do I think it's acceptable to run out of an ingredient for a cocktail featured on the menu.   We ordered our entrees, my boyfriend the filet and myself the prime rib. The server tried to suggest adding mushrooms to his filet but couldn't tell us what kind of mushrooms they were and instead settled for drawing us a picture of what the mushroom looked like. 10 minutes after we ordered the server came back and told me they were out of the prime rib. It DOES say \"limited availability\" on the menu and I understand this is an easy item to run out of but I think a server should know this prior to taking an order at the table. I opted to have the balsamic ribeye instead.   When our food arrived everything was cooked perfectly but we both found everything to be over seasoned. The balsamic ribeye was delicious but the flavor was too intense for an entire steak. I could only eat a couple bites because it was so rich.   For dessert we had the brownie which the server said was the best which we thought was just mediocre.   This isn't a restaurant we would recommend or come back to. It was just \"eh\"."}
{"text":"A manager from WCG emailed me saying I wouldn't have had a bad experience if I had asked for a manager.  Thanks, but I think I will stick to restaurants who don't need me to complain to a manager in order to get good service."}
{"text":"So I met a friend there for dinner last night and the joint was jumpin'!  i was absolutely floored by the tomato soup...OMG, it was just delicious!  I also had the sesame tuna for my main course...it was only OK, cooked too much for my taste.  It's a cute place and the staff is really well trained so that was really a nice treat.  I don't know if I will make this a regular since it's so far away but it has potential.  NOW, if they had a good happy hour, it might become a stop.  Just sayin'"}
{"text":"Been wanting to try this place for awhile.....BIG DISAPPOINTMENT!    I'm usually very nice about reviews but I won't be back again........no excuse for cold food......my wife's food was cold too.   We even went when it wasn't that busy.   Any hot dish we ordered was beyond cold......and for the price  you pay........absolutely not worth it.    Ordered the bread pudding and that was cold.........am I wrong or isn't that suppose to be even a little bit warm?    Place is nice, service is nice but the food temps were a major problem.........major!!    Should have went to Firebirds, half the price and much better........thank me later."}
{"text":"The list of things that makes this place awesome can go on and on.  The service is top notch, you will never be in need of anything.  The food, beyond outstanding. I LOVE the Filet Mignon Chopped Salad.  This salad will move you, it is unlike any other.  I took a friend there the other day, boasting about this salad, and he was impressed.  Yes, it's a man friendly salad as well.  The ingredients are fresh and crispy and let me tell you about the dessert.  We had the White Chocolate Brownie, which was beyond amazing.  The place is usually pretty packed, so it can be a bit loud but there is ample seating both inside and out.    Overall love the place, it is a bit pricey spent $60 on lunch for 2 people so heed that warning but aside from that, it's AMAZING."}
{"text":"I travel to Scottsdale a lot on business and ended up eating at White Chocolate Grill for the third time this past Thursday. The first time I had Jambalaya almost as good as my momma makes. Second I had a hamburger made from fresh ground beef that they grind right there. It was incredible. And this last time I had Macadamia Mahi Mahi. WOW! And everyone else loved their food also. What a great Restaurant."}
{"text":"This place is one of my favorite, the waitresses  Are nice and kind. The food is great and you have to try it.   EA"}
{"text":"In town for a business conference, this restaurant popped up on Yelp with great reviews. Decided to give it a try & the food was amazing! Especially loved the house specialty - gin tomato soup. It was different but very hearty. Also enjoyed the balsamic ribeye and desserts - white chocolate bread pudding & brownie. Amazing service as well!"}
{"text":"My family and I eat here regularly. A couple things we really like are the Baby Back Ribs (Our favorite item on the menu), French Dip, Filet Cobb Salad, WCG Salad, Field Greens, Grilled Artichoke, and the WCG Brownie for desert. I also love their bourbon menu, it may be the best variety in Phoenix. The service is always great and they have never let us down. Why a four star review you may ask. The only reason is that I feel their sides are lacking compared with the quality of the entrees and appetizers. The portions are usually pretty small when it comes to the steamed and/or seasonal veggies and are often over cooked. Small price to pay when everything else is spot on. We love this place and will continue to visit."}
{"text":"White chocolate grill is one of my favorite places to grab a nice dinner our with family. They have a large wine selection and will accommodate almost any order. The only complaint I have is that the bar area and dining both can be extremely loud which takes away from conversation."}
{"text":"Tried out this place last Friday for a late lunch. The interior immediately reminded me of Houstons.  I found out the owner once worked at Houstons so......I had guacamole and chips and the Ahi, mango and avocado salad. It was very good and extremely reminiscent of the Ahi and mango avocado salad that I've had at Houstons....The outdoor covered patio is really cute and I'd like to enjoy it at night for dinner in front of that fireplace. The bar is awesome and I think my husband will like it. I'll be back."}
{"text":"Best service we have ever have ever, our server BRIAN was very helpfull , helping us decide , polite, just absolutely the best server I have ever come across in all my dining experience . Because of service like BRIAN now it's one of my favorite place to eat! Ps : the food was outstanding we literally ate even after we were full even the dessert! This place was outstanding !"}
{"text":"I took my mother here for her birthday. She loved it and it was good food. Food is a bit pricey but not unreasonable. I would go back to this place again. Just wish they did something for people's birthdays."}
{"text":"Came here with some friends and ordered drinks and dessert. Nice decor, ordered some food to go and it was delish!"}
{"text":"I love their Ahi Tuna Salad! I usually don't write reviews on chain restaurants, but I had to because I eat here frequently and love their tuna salad. I have been here many time with family, friends, coworkers, and clients and there are not many complaints! The servers are always very attentive, sometimes overly attentive. The ambiance is nice and how the tables are set up makes you feel like you have your own space (not overly crowded). My biggest complaint is that all the desserts are white chocolate desserts...I know it is the 'white chocolate' Grill but, another option would be nice. I love chocolate, but I am not a fan of white chocolate.   On the weekends and Friday, I would recommend having a reservation otherwise the wait could be quite long.  If you are looking for all around good food, good service with a pleasant atmosphere this is a great spot!"}
{"text":"Could possibly be the best dessert we have ever had. The food was great and the service is amazing. A big bonus, they even take reservations!  We have already made reservations for our Anniversary!"}
{"text":"First time at the WCG and I couldn't be more pleased with the service or food. Would definitely eat there again! Our server Kendall was very nice and patient. Took his time and explained the menu and genuinely seemed to care, not just because it was his job. Would fill his glass and was on top of empty dishes. I had the prime rib and it was perfect. The taste was far better than most others I've had prime rib at. Desert was excellent as we had the white chocolate brownie. Excellent dining experience and would fair prices. Would recommend to anyone for any occasion."}
{"text":"Amazing!!! Love this place. I had the Parmesan crusted fillet mignon and it was cooked to perfection. The service was also exceptional. I highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"went here when all the snow birds left town (5/18/11) noisy but good atmosphere. tomato gin soup was awesome as was the salsa... i know..salsa?.. but i would have eaten it with a spoon!!! great service (yo, Jaime!!) had a great burger and wife had a chopped salad both at a fair price good drinks... will be going back next trip"}
{"text":"Had a wonderful service experience and a good lunch. I almost bypass this place due to the name. I was in the area while my auto was being serviced and decided to give it a shot. The service from the moment I walked was great. All smiles. Had lunch at their bar and I was surprised as the bar was fantastic and had a high end feel. All the bells and whistles in the bar. Did not have anything from the bar but saw that it was doing well. Had the Cajun chicken sandwich which I was told was a staff favorite with fries and it tasted excellent.  Portions were good. Little pricey for lunch but then again the lunch was worth it. Great ambiance and will surely visit again when in the area."}
{"text":"The service and food was amazing. The menu is packed with great options it was hard to choose. We settled on the trout and scallops. We almost ordered the roasted chicken so we could try the bacon almond hash with broccoli. When the waitress asked the manager if we could buy a side of the hash, he said \"no!\".  Really???"}
{"text":"One of our all time favorites. Great staff. Solid, stable morale throughout. Excellent, chill vibe. Phenomenal food and the most attentive management in the area. We have a PT facility in the airpark and cater to a good base of professional clients. It's a fan favorite. Ask for Mike in the bar. Tell them big Dave sent you. The best!"}
{"text":"I've been here about a dozen times since it opened many moons ago and while it was actually pretty great at first, throughout the years its been hit or miss upon each subsequent visit.  The service for me has absolutely never been an issue, in fact its been pretty fantastic.  The food however can either be pretty great or quite frankly awful.  Not a great spectrum to what is an already established restaurant and menu a la houstons.    My number one suggestion is do not order the burger...of any type.. which i unfortunately did last night.  Its pretty awfully dry (although ordered medium rare), with what amounts to a cup of grated raw cheese thrown over it on a tiny little bun.  I should have known better,  but remember the burger being great when it first opened which was If memory serves me right was well over 7 years ago at least.  But I did enjoy the french dip sandwich the last few times I was there and the fries have always been great.  The ribs also were pretty good although I had them a few years ago so who knows if that is still the case.    The end all be all is with the prices they charge you should have a good experience each and every time, however that is not the case.  Consistency and flavorful dishes are not the fortay here, and at $13 minimum a dish Id rather travel a bit more from now on."}
{"text":"Great service.  We enjoy the food, but I believe the Naperville, IL location is better.  They seem to offer a larger variety of specials.  But, and thats a large but, the Scottsdale location is still a must try.  My favorite item is the Quinoa veggie burger."}
{"text":"This was my first time and it definitely won't be my last. Everything from entrance till the I be was amazing. The hostesses sat us in a timely matter and when we sat we were greeted by our server assistant within a minute. Our service was quick and efficient. That's one of the things that makes me really enjoy a restaurant. I used to be in the service industry so good service can really make or break a review in my opinion.  I had the filet with brussel sprouts on the side and man was it good. My steak was perfectly cooked to order and I enjoyed every bite. For $34 it was definitely a great piece of meat. My friend had the rotisserie chicken with side of carrots and was that good too! Oh my gosh I loved everything. Of course we had to get dessert, i mean who goes to a place called white chocolate without getting dessert. I rarely get dessert at restaurants but I'm so glad we did here. The bread pudding was incredible.   This was a great experience. Our server Chris (no not me) was great! He was super friendly and helpful. I love servers that check in on us, but not too much. My ketel one was never empty. Good job white chocolate! We'll be back soon!!"}
{"text":"We love White Chocolate Grill. The desserts are listed on the top of the menu (and for a reason). We will come here literally just for the bread pudding ! Top notch service ... The chocolate martini is a great after dinner drink. Whiskey selection is amazing. I would recommend it to anyone."}
{"text":"This was an OK place.    The food was good and not over priced.  No complaints on the food.  And the flourless chocolate cake thing was AWESOME.  It is not a romantic or \"local feeling\" place and not good for a sit, relax, and talk kind of date.  It has has a large chain feeling with out much charm or atmosphere (reminded us of a bland Cheesecake Factory).  When we went (Friday evening) it was very loud, we couldn't hear ourselves talk across the table without raising our voices.    Service was pleasant enough, but not personal.  The goal for all employees was to get you in, get you food, and get you back out as fast as possible.  All the employees were zipping about doing all kinds of things, it just seemed rather chaotic to watch.  We were in town on vacation and after eating at other local places with great service and atmosphere the rest of the week, this place was a major let down.  We feel that dining out should be a complete experience, not just food as fast as possible."}
{"text":"I love the food and eat there quite often, but take-out is a pain. Take-out is only offered before 6pm on weekend nights. Additionally, I have had a lot of issues with take-out in the last 5 months. One time I waited 40 minutes at the restaurant to pick up my food (after the allotted 20 min). Another time my order was wrong and didn't know until I got home (always check inside the boxes before leaving). Most recently, I called to place an order on a weekend night and they said they couldn't do it because they were busy... and I called before their deadline of 6pm. Absolutely ridiculous."}
{"text":"Staff has a real attitude from the front desk greeting   Someone takes your order someone else delivers. Not bad but no checking back.   Total disconnect I. This outstanding beautiful eatery.   We won't bother with it again too many other together places around.   We asked the hostess \" you must love working here in this beautiful place ?\"  She replies \" it's ok \"  We knew we were in trouble at the get go.    Ugh."}
{"text":"Very nice place. Didn't have dinner but the menu looked delicious. We went for desert, but will come back for dinner. We had the white chocolate brownie. Good lord it was awesome. Gooey and warm"}
{"text":"My wife and I love this place. A bit out of our budget to go as much as we want.   The artichoke is a must when you can get it. Not sure how it's prepared, but it is amazing. Be adventurous and try the tomato gin soup. I can explain exactly how delicious this is, just trust me ( you have to be 21 to order it).  Great Salads, steaks, and seafood.   I am not a dessert person, but I do like a bite or two of my wife's favorite desert....white chocolate brownie with ice cream."}
{"text":"I love this place!  Only been for lunches, but I highly recommend the WGC salad, or the French dip.  I had a guest once who also said the crab cakes were very good.  Thank you!!"}
{"text":"We knew as soon as we walked in...we were in trouble...chips and salsa...store bought. Store bought frozen ribs served cold... brussel sprouts purposefully served chilled...chicken lacked flavor above a bed of nonsense \"flavor enhancers\"...and warm white chocolate brownie was OK...also not fresh - everything here is just reheated and served."}
{"text":"Wine is good, prime rib is good and service is good. Reasonably priced. Pretty popular place so be prepared to wait."}
{"text":"Dark, mysterious and sultry inside and out, but lacks that passion, that soul, that oomph.  Wanna be upscale, but you can't dress up a boring personality.  Ultimately just your cookie cutter chain restaurant.    Beautiful decor, menu is just bland and limited compared to the variety you'd get a CAKE or Yardhouse.  Southwestern egg roll appetizers were nothing special (can't beat CAKE avocado egg rolls). Had a unmemorable french dip.  Really wanted some mashed potatoes w/ some gravy, but their special gravy is basically just like a runny au jus.  Service was decent, but sadly can't make up for the unexciting grub.    Eat here if: You like driving a Prius around a racetrack."}
{"text":"This place is the place to go in northern Scottsdale, for a reasonably priced and delicious meal! Always packed.  They have really unusual dishes, that make it hard to pick what to order! I had the  Rotisserie Chicken Crêpes filled with rotisserie chicken, spinach and a mushroom cream sauce. Topped with Madeira sauce and parmesan cheese. Delicious!!  Then my hubby and I finishes with the White Chocolate Brownie a la Mode. WOW!  Fantastic! We even came back another night on our trip, for dessert, and had the White Chocolate Brownie, again!!  I highly recommend the White Chocolate Grill!"}
{"text":"@quinterogolf. We had the best meal tonight at white chocolate grill.  The service was fantastic.  The meal was served so promptly.  I had the fish of the day.  snapper!  It was perfectly cooked.  The steamed green beans were crisp and lovely.  My husband loves the rib and chicken !"}
{"text":"Here comes the dreaded three star review. I hate writing 3 star reviews. They feel like teenage breakups... no, no, it's not you, it's me, I am just not satisfied. Sometimes the 3 star reviews are like nagging mothers... fine, mom, I don't want to cover my cleavage but I will do it for you.  Bottom line, I feel indifferent towards mediocre places. Three star reviews have nothing interesting to say. Who wants to go to an average place anyway? Don't we all want what's best and top notch? We are Americans after all. USA!! USA!!   I digress. Let's get to the review.  Recipe for White Chocolate Grill: 1 scoop of Applebee's. 2 scoops of Outback 1/2 scoop of Pei Wei 2 scoops of other generic chain restaurants  Mix the above ingredients well, add a dash of good looking and professional staff, one semi-trendy looking bar area, and serve to patrons who do not know any better. There you go, you have it!  Okay food, everything we ordered was edible, nothing stood out. It's a safe bet when you do not want to venture out  or if you don't want to play all dress up for fancy food. It fulfills the need for a uninteresting but safe restaurant where everyone in the family, including that bratty screaming six year old (there are quite a few of them here), can get something to eat.  In the end, my mother-in-law was happy everyone in the family got something to eat. That's all that matters.  Told you this review will be boring."}
{"text":"This place is AWESOME. It is very similar to Houston's and I am totally fine with that since the closest Houston's is in Old Town.   This is a usual Friday night date spot for me and my boo. Usually has a wait but we get lucky every time to find a seat at the bar to order a pre dinner cocktail. The lemon drops are tasty, the BF gets gin and tonics normally. He wishes they had a little more selection of gin..but no big deal.   We like to go for the date night special where we can sample an app, salads, and a main meal for about $30 bucks a piece. We are not strict on how much we spend on meals so it just depends on what the main entrees there are offering at that time.  My typical eating style is big eyes, smaller stomach. I order way too much food but luckily, my man usually eats any left overs the next day.   I am a big fan of the the artichoke dip with the salsa as an appetizer and I usually go straight for the ribs. They are damn good! I have also had a steak that is marinated in balsamic vinegar. The steak looked funky when they brought it out, I didn't say anything and they said they were already making me another steak to take home. OK! Steak and eggs for breakfast.   Go to this place. You will make it one of your weekly destinations."}
{"text":"Everything I've had here has been really good, but I have to order their rotisserie chicken and mashed potatoes every time because it is too good to pass up. I don't know what they put in the gravy but I've never had chicken this good. You really can't go wrong with anything on their menu. Good atmosphere and service too. And if you're there around November/December you have to get the pumpkin cheesecake, there are no words to describe the goodness."}
{"text":"Had dinner here the other night.  I tried then cesar salad NO DRESSING , so I sent it back.  SO I asked for a blue cheese dressing salad, WHAT do I get a salad with a few bluecheese sprinkles on.   Fries were cold and had to be sent back.  Looks Like I am always going back to Houstons"}
{"text":"Omg... I mean the appetizers delicious. Started off with the shrimp cocktail and ahi tuna nachos!!   Main course order the blue cheese crusted filet was Cooked to perfection with creamy mashed potatoes, but don't forget the honey glazed carrots were on point!!  To finish off with ordered the \"White Chocolate Brownie\" that was seriously on another level !! I can now claim this to be the best ever desert I've ever had and the Brownie was simply on its own mind blowing!!"}
{"text":"This place is delicious. The food and service are always consistent. I gave it 4 four stars for the lack of diverse appetizers.  However don't let that deter you and if you save room for dessert the banana creme pie is fantastic. My girlfriend and I will be repeat customers for the foreseeable future."}
{"text":"Once again another \"this place is awesome\" word of mouth place in Scottsdale that let me down.  I had been hearing about this place for awhile but its kind of far so when I saw the groupon for WCG, it was the push I needed to head north.    Things that went wrong: - I didn't know it was a must have reservations kind of place, but it is.  Thats fine though- you live and you learn, but the way the hostess handled it was the problem.  She was very rude, took our name and gave us the vibrator thing.  After sitting for 30ish minutes we heard another host tell people coming in that they could sit in the bar area or the patio instead of waiting.  Would of been nice to know when we came in!  -I don't like the fact that you have to ask for bread.  If a restaurant is gonna have bread it should just be automatically taken to the table.  It makes you feel like a fatty, cheap ass wanting free food when you have to ask.   -I got the chicken crepes. The madeira sauce was just a dark gravy, it just wasn't my thing so I can't blame them for me making a bad choice.  What I was mad about was the broccoli.  I've had better broccoli from a school food service buffet line!  The broccoli was so overcooked that it turned to mush when you touched it with a fork.  AWFUL!  Should NOT happen at a nice restaurant.  Things that were good: -The server -My bf said the ribs were good.  I didn't try. -The white chocolate blonde brownie was amazing.  It is the only thing that is making me choose 3 stars rather than 2.  I will most likely not be returning here.  Not worth the drive or money."}
{"text":"The White Chocolate Grill is a great place to meet friends for a dinner and a drink.   I love the decor of the restaurant.  The menu is unique and the food is unbelievable.  ( It can get a little loud when it's busy. )"}
{"text":"The ahi tuna salad is amazing!  If you swing in before the lunch hour rush you can be seated right away.  The staff is so nice.  I can't wait to go back next week!  YUM!"}
{"text":"This place is a Cheesecake Factory Restaurant wannabe.  I decided to write this review with apprehension. Much to mention and much to question.  Not trying to make enemies in Phoenix with the yelpers, or for that matter the restaurants but I will start by questioning the yelp reviewers from this area and why  3 star restaurants (clearly just an A OK where I am from) are being rated 4 and 5 stars? This place is simply not a 4 or 5 star where I come from. Yes I am being snobby but thats partly what yelp is about.  Let's just say that I have spent much time on the phone with management and the insurance company trying to resolve my issues here @ this restaurant. I have been promised that my issues are being addressed and that management takes them very serious. I do have reason to doubt but will give them the benefit of the doubt for now.  The great service that people claim here is ok (3 stars) but the people operate like they are on auto pilot. They know the company motto, fast and service with a smile but it fails to be anything personable and i just find personality equates into stars...more stars than just one. The food runner asked who was eating one dish, placed it in front of the wrong person and while we were saying \"no\" he kept putting down the second wrong meal ( when you get one meal placement wrong, chances are you'll get two or more wrong). We started to switch the plates ourselves since the food runner was already running back to the kitchen.  Food, the food was ok, seriously ok, just ok. See, three ok's equal three stars not 4 or 5 stars. The steak 6.5 ounce was cooked right but was just ok. Again, ok is 3 stars on yelp. The rotisserie chicken, 3 stars, just ok. The caprese salad, odd with cherry tomatoes with lil balls of mozzarella, balsamic vinegar...ummm guess how many stars? Yup, 3, quite possibly a 2. The dessert was the banana thingamajig, I didn't partake so let's say a zero for that which won't effect the overall score. It is cute that desserts are placed at the top of the menu in the beginning but they should put the dessert at the top of the bill too. One weird thing, when seated with two kids and two adults, they switched the kids black napkin roll ups with white ones? Hmmm, profiling kids? Why?  The place is dark, loud but good people watching place. Nice fire pit outside for waiting, lines move rather quickly but seriously it's a knock off of the cheesecake factory but the cheesecake factory is much better!  I reserve the right to re-star depending on the outcome of the management and the insurance companies response."}
{"text":"Well it has been a week since I dined at the WCG and had a bad situation. I sent the Managing Partner an email that evening expressing my concerns. By the way the Managing Partner has his email printed on the front of their menus. You would think that after a week someone would respond to my concerns....BUT NO!  My email stated that while dining at the bar I had two insects crawl across my bar napkin in front of my Prime Rib dinner as well as a dead fruit fly. I asked for my check and to bag most of my dinner up to take home to my dogs. The server just shrugged her shoulders when I said I wasn't happy with the uninvited pests. On the way out I looked for a Manager but only two hostesses were at the front desk who were busy seating customers.  If you are going to disclose your email on your menus you should respond to them in a timely manner! #BadStyle"}
{"text":"Another on the list of items that you simply must have before you die:  the tomato gin soup at WCG.  I will agree that the place has its misses on the menu, but overall it is a very solid place with at least one completely exceptional soup.  They have a filet cobb salad with a red wine vinaigrette which is really good and I always love the baked broccoli or the honey-gooped carrots (not their real name).  Finally, their sandwiches are really tasty.  The story goes that some people split off from Houston's and went off to start WCG.  You'll see that right away.  But whereas Houston's is a five star delight, WCG merits only four.  But trust me when I tell you to get the tomato gin soup.  Today."}
{"text":"I've been here a few times and have always found it so-so.  Our past visit rocked my socks!  The mojito was delicious - wonderful balance of mint, lime, sugar and rum.  My steak was a tad pricey but it too was delicious.  It's a bit on the spendy side but I'd definitely go again."}
{"text":"The food is ok. A little over seasoned. The restaurant popped up on here when I did a search for organic restaurants however, nothing on the menu is organic. Thats a disappointment.  The staff is very friendly and on point. I won't be back but only because its not conducive to my eating style. How they got categorized in organic is questionable."}
{"text":"Came here on a Sunday night at 8:00 - it was not busy at all.  I guess we were not in the mood to eat out, because nothing seemed quite right here.  The server was efficient but very cool and aloof.  The chips and salsa appetizer was way too spicy to eat.  The shrimp cocktail was good, but it was served on bed of lettuce - never seen that before.  My BBQ hamburger was ok, and side of honey glazed carrots were a little mushy.  The tomato gin soup tasted a little sour, and just did not taste right.  We got the white chocolate bread pudding and it was just ok - it did not WOW me like I was hoping it would.  The white chocolate banana pie, again was just ok. This place gets good reviews, but I just didn't see it."}
{"text":"I absolutely love this place. Excellent food and atmosphere. Anytime I'm in the area I eat there, and I have to sit by the bar (it's gorgeously designed). If you're looking to not spend a great deal of money just get a burger (and their white chocolate bread pudding!), they're delicious and worth it.   Also, make sure you make a reservation in advance for Friday and Saturday nights because, it can get PACKED.   Lastly, it's good for any night really, a family dinner, friends/ladies night, date night, etc. It's a classy place with style. (Yeah if you've noticed I haven't been there during the day so I don't know how lunch is - but I have been there for all of the previous reasons/nights mentioned)."}
{"text":"This place is amazing! The food is spectacular,the service is five star, and we love the  décor! If you don't at least give this place a try, you'll never know what your missing. Eric was a great Server, and the manager took care of us as well. A must try! Seriously! We'll be back, again and again. Thanks White Chocolate Grill!"}
{"text":"This place is consistent and one of the only chain restaurants I'm willing to visit.  Last I went my friend and I ordered the same thing, so they brought us out something different to try. On the whole the place is a little on the pricy side....but a nice way to grab something to eat before or after a movie."}
{"text":"I just love this place and the ambiance is great. I always get Idaho trout here no matter how many times i come here."}
{"text":"Funny, I didn't remember going to this place until I saw I did a review over five years ago.  Good place, very aggressive on the customer service.  They followed us in and asked if we had been there before.  When we said no, they asked if we had questions on the menu.  We had not even taken our seats yet, so we politely said, um, we haven't seen the menu yet."}
{"text":"Probably my favorite restaurant. Not over priced but still gives off the vibe of an upscale restaurant. The service is usually pretty good from my experience. The white chocolate brownie is so good definitely share it with someone."}
{"text":"So delicious. Loved every bit of it.  My husband and I decided to go out out and splurge in calories and money a bit. We got a chocolate martini and a white Russian to start. The chocolate martini was too sweet, but if you're into a dessert drink with your meal was good. The white Russian was okay, probably wouldn't order it from here again. I cannot recommend the Four Cheese Spinach and Artichoke dip enough. So freaking delicious. We practically inhaled it. We both enjoyed our entrees of the sweet BBQ baby back ribs and the BBQ bacon burger. The fries were particularly good. Dessert was a Blondie brownie. Super good. Had to take a lot of this food home, yay for leftovers!"}
{"text":"This was our first experience dining here and we won't return. The long list of service failures was over the top. Our server made it clear you had to specifically request basics like ketchup and mustard, didn't check in on our table, and never put the order in for to go item. They were short on chairs so asked to take one from our table and proceeded to hit one of us in the head w the chair and then knock dirt into a salad and actually had to ask if we wanted another one. After waiting for 30 min on the to go order we were informed it would be awhile longer because a big party was now ahead of us but that they wouldn't be charging us for the meal (which we had already paid for and asked for at the time we ordered our meals).  The food was ok but not good enough to risk the bad service."}
{"text":"Came by here for dinner while we were in Scottsdale and had a wonderful time.  The house specialty: Tomato Gin Soup Fire roasted tomatoes, cream, bacon, mushrooms and Tanqueray Gin was really good and the first time I had a soup where you had to be 21 to eat it - but it was really good.  I like to start a meal where both the food & drink might give me a buzz!"}
{"text":"Thoroughly enjoyed our meal and the staff. Very attentive staff and excellent service. Food was excellent and we enjoyed our food. The selection was great for my health conscience diet and my husbands looking for that wonderful Rib Eye. Don't forget desert, you won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"I went here with friends for drinks.  I had the mojito and my friend had some lemonade/stawberry drink at the bar.  They were both delicious.  I ordered the Caprese salad and she ordered the southwest egg rolls.  My caprese salad was very fresh and delicious and her egg rolls were really good.  We then ordered The White Chocolate Bread Pudding to share.  I had a White Chocolate Martini to go with it.  Couldnt be better.  So delicious.  Great time!"}
{"text":"I have been wanting to try this restaurant for years, so my fiancé and I decided to try it for our anniversary tonight. From the beginning, the customer service was great. Very welcoming and the atmosphere was great as well. It reminds me of Hillstone on Camelback, but not as pretentious (even though I love Hillstone). We ordered drinks, the spicy chicken egg rolls, the bbq platter and a dessert. The food was fabulous! I took awhile to finish my drink, and our server asked if I liked it because she seemed concerned with how long it took for me to finish. I assured her it was great, I was just taking my time. She came back after awhile with a fresh chilled glass for my martini- I was blown away at how thoughtful that was! They consistently had \"managerial\" types walking around checking on everyone, the bussers were very friendly, and the server was great! It seems a lot of places have been lacking in their customer service, but White Chocolate Grill went above and beyond. We will definitely be coming back!"}
{"text":"The food was delicious! I got the parmesan crusted sirloin and my husband got the bbq meat platter (ribs, chicken, pulled pork) and it was all great.  My only complaint was my portion size.  Small steak and a small pile of fries.  It was a good thing my husband got a bit more food because I finished his plate. You would think spending $75 (w/o tip) would mean you'd have some to take home but nope! But it was still delicious.  Also, make a reservation."}
{"text":"I had a filet mignon salad, which was great. Took too long to bring the food, but the manager was super nice and offered it for free! Can't complain."}
{"text":"Today was my fourth visit to WCG (twice for lunch, twice for dinner).  I've never been disappointed in anything I've ordered there.  My favorite lunch was the tuna burger that they offered as a lunch special--a patty of tuna grilled like a hamburger, only it was still nice and pink on the inside.  It was served with a wasabi sauce that made it scruptious.  Tonight for dinner I had the 6.5 oz filet mignon, and it was absolutely perfect--medium rare, melt-in-your-mouth tender and perfectly seasoned.  My hubby had the ribs and raved about them (he also brought half of them home since it's a large rack.)  I have two favorite dishes that I MUST have at WCG each time I visit.  The first is the Israeli couscous.  It's a delicious side dish of pearly Israeli couscous mixed with golden raisins, pistachios, chopped herbs, in a creamy flavorful (curry?) sauce.  It's amazing!  The second dish is their white chocolate bread pudding.  It's a large portion, enough to feed several people, and it's so rich and decadent.  It comes with real whipped cream, and has a scrumptious white sauce.  Superb!  Service at WCG is generally attentive and prompt.  The decor is upscale with lots of dark mahogany wood, mood lighting, booths and tables.  The bar area is very cool with a lighted display of various liquor bottles.  The entrance to the restaurant features a seating area with a fireplace that comes in handy on the few cool evenings that we have here in AZ.  I definitely recommend WCG!"}
{"text":"Great place for a work lunch, a date, or eating with friends. Service was very professional and efficient. The menu is very large, with a few options for vegetarians. I had the quinoa veggie burger, and I thought it was outstanding. I always get nervous ordering veggie burgers from restaurants in fear they use crap Boca or Morning Star patties, but the White Chocolate Grill makes their own in house and it's wonderful. Very fresh, great light texture that's slightly cripsy on the outside, and the toppings for the burger are so flavorful (aioli that basically dresses everything). It's a little bit on the pricey side, but the atmosphere is very nice and overall a very good experience."}
{"text":"Great food, the best service I ever had at a restaurant to date. Other restaurants need to take note. Also I must mention our waitress Swazy (I hope I'm spelling it correctly) was amazing. Very pleasant and knowledgeable.  The food was amazing. I ordered the Jambalaya and my husband ordered the baby back ribs and it was wonderful. Large portions so bring your appetite."}
{"text":"We continue to enjoy our happy hour visits.  Since we live elsewhere, it is an experience we enjoy only when we are at our place here.  This time a bartender who has waited on us before gave excellent beverage service and took our orders.  He kept track of beverage levels and refilled or replaced as needed.  The sliders are always a good choice but my wife enjoyed an entree salad. It is the time of year for their famous pumpkin cheesecake which we enjoyed too.  It isn't just happy hour, of course. We were here for lunch recently and had a good meal."}
{"text":"Chill, cozy vibe. White chocolate grill the spot on a cold Arizona night. I ordered enchiladas and a beer. Not bad. Lacked Arizona local flavor and creativity but overall not bad for a chain."}
{"text":"We went on Saturday night and this place was packed. Luckily I had made reservations beforehand. The bar area is pretty cool, but it and the dining area were so loud. We sat on the patio, which is covered and has fans and misters so we could actually hear each other talk.   We tried the date night special. It included 1 appetizer, 2 salads, 2 entrees and a dessert to share for $58. The AZ rolls were a pretty tasty appetizer, even though I had to pick the corn out of it. I enjoyed my WCG Bacon Blue Cheese salad. It would have been a lot better had they used spinach instead of mixed greens. The Caesar came with some nice big shavings of parm. Yummy. We both decided on the Parmesan Fillet for our main. The parm was a little overwhelming. We both pushed most of it aside, but the meat was very tender. My mashed potatoes started off yummy, but got pretty hard toward the end of the meal. We split the White Chocolate Brownie for dessert and it was pretty good, but we were so full we didn't finish.   Service was slow. We were here for almost 2 hours, but our waiter was very friendly. Everyone I know really likes this place so I think we may come back and give it another chance."}
{"text":"Its really good place, delicious food, nice service, very pleasant atmosphere.  Well we'll get back to this restaurant)"}
{"text":"Best service I had in a long time.  The service was very attentive.  Our waitress Susie was so nice, even came over and gave my dad.. a huge martini fan.. a cold glass half way thru his drink.  Food was good and desert was excellent..   It is amazing what good service can do..  thank you Susie."}
{"text":"Excellent service and menu options.  It was a short wait and we were promptly sat and greeted.  All around a great meal and experience!!"}
{"text":"First time in at WCG and we absolutely loved it!! Ashley our waitress was very attentive and gave us great service.  That combined with a great dinner just made our night. Bbq trio was spectacular and great ambiance. Finally she recommended the white chocolate brownie wich sealed the deal. We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Excellent pulled pork sandwich! 100% pork -no fat! Also very nice French fries. My husband had an Amana blue cheese burger and he loved it also."}
{"text":"Impeccable customer service especially if you have a large group.  Our hostess was very friendly and accommodating. The Specialty Drinks are delish, try the White Chocolate Martini  especially if you like sweets, best drink I've had in a while .  The appetizers; AZ Egg Rolls  and Four Cheese Spinach & Artichoke Dip as they are very good, the  egg rolls have a southwestern taste of deliciousness.  As far as the entrée , the trout and chicken enchiladas were pretty good. A nice place to take a large group."}
{"text":"I've been having dreams about the Famous Grilled Chicken Salad.  It was so good, I wish I could go to the White Chocolate Grill every week and eat one.  I keep thinking of ways to make that convenient for me, but in reality it's crazy to schedule your life around a salad.    It does remind me a lot of Houston's, but that's okay, I like Houston's... and Houston's doesn't have that salad.  The service was great and I like the intimacy of the booths.  The lighting is really neat if you pay attention to the details. In the bar, narrow streams of light wash out strips of color and expose the texture of the brick wall.    I will be back and I will eat that God among salads.  Seriously, if you like a good salad, get the Famous Grilled Chicken.  I gave 5 stars because of the salad, I just couldn't help it.  I mean, salad's not that great and that is how good it was.  All my dining companions enjoyed their food too, by the way."}
{"text":"One of my my favorite salads is at the White Chocolate Grill. The Filet Mingon Cobb Salad is FANTABULOUS and DELICIOUS!! Their seasonal Pumpkin Cheesecake is the best cheesecake I have ever eaten and wish they had it all year (except I would gain a few pounds). Their other food is also very tasty, great service and ambiance!  Not a place for groups though, they only have booths...  highly recommend you try White Chocolate Grill though... It's fabulous!"}
{"text":"One of my VERY favorite places to eat. The menu is so unique and their desserts are STELLAR. I think I come just for the dessert, but the food is just as good. I love bringing out of towners here, as I think it is one of the most unique restaurants in Scottsdale.  Their waiters/waitresses are very professional and accomodating. Always my favorite."}
{"text":"The food was far better than I previously remembered and the service was more than impeccable. Amazing teamwork and a great meal. A good spot for a nice lunch or a semiformal dinner."}
{"text":"Always good and consistent. Old dining place, good food rather traditional, booths, Good maybe for an older crowd or you want to talk intimately with friends."}
{"text":"I think I had high standards for this place before I even set foot in the restaurant just b/c the name sounded so delish, unfortunately that's where all the magic stopped.  The decor was nice but it kind of has that chain restaurant vibe and the food just didn't make the cut for me.  I tried the artichoke dip for appetizer, the salmon as my entree, and the souffle as my dessert...none of the dishes blew me away so I didn't end up finishing any of them even though i was famished!"}
{"text":"Yes. Just so much yes. The burger was awesome, my husband had the Cajun chicken sandwich and loved it, my grandparents couldn't stop raving about their barbecue! Our waitress was so sweet and though she was so attentive to our needs, other members of the wait staff would stop and grab an empty plate, top off a water or just see how things were going which I really appreciated. We ordered the white chocolate raspberry cheesecake and the white chocolate banana bread putting. Holy. Wow. Tried the cheesecake first and was in Heaven (or so I thought), then took a bite of the bread pudding and omg guys. Even if you don't plan on having a meal, stop by and get this bread pudding. It's phenomenal. It's amazing. It's everything. I didn't want to share. GO GET THIS PUDDING."}
{"text":"I must admit, the idea I had of this place totally did not fit with reality. And that's not their fault. Somehow, I had this image of the White Chocolate Grill as a chic place - but it is far from it. The decor really does remind me of Houston's. The place is very dark and fairly masculine. Not exactly what I had in mind for lunch with mom, but whatever ... I was ready for anything.  Still, I never did quite get my bearings in this place. Service was rushed and the food wasn't really that great. I can't turn down an Ahi Tuna Salad, which is what I ordered here, but the dressing was overpowering, even after I sent the salad back asking for less of the creamy stuff. So that wasn't good, but even more disappointing was the tuna, which really had no flavor. Oh, and the server never did return to ask how everything tasted. Given that it didn't taste that good, that was disappointing.  The bar was beautiful and I may be back for a happy hour drink. But overall, not a place I'm clamoring to return to."}
{"text":"WORST EXPERIENCE EVER!!! I made a reservation ahead of time for a special evening, then called that afternoon to confirm my reservation and time. As we were driving, we even called to say we would be 3 min late to the reservation. They said it was fine come on in and we will be waiting for you. We were 4 min late to the reservation, and as we were walking in, an employee comes to the door. We were thinking 'what great service, they are evening getting the door.  No. They locked the door in our face. Then the said they cannot let anyone in and refused to serve us. When we said we were going to write a review on this experience, they then said we could come in and eat. We didn't. Never will again. Real companies value customer service above all"}
{"text":"This restaurant has great ambiance and style.  The menu is diverse and easy yet elegant if wanted.  We split a side Caesar Salad (smaller to go with dinner).  The Caesar need a little less dressing although the flavor was outstanding.  One of us ordered the Classic Beef Dip with mashed potatoes as the side ant the other ordered the Madeira Chicken with the side being honey glazed carrots.  We shared the plates of the sides and took home half of each order as they easily could have served four people.  Both dishes had fantastic flavors, great sauces and overly generous on portions.  It was a great dining experience"}
{"text":"The food is fantastic, the service was absolute garbage. I came for my birthday and they sat us in a two-person booth by the kitchen. After moving us, we realized that we had one lunch menu and one dinner menu. When we asked about the menu, the server she said to look at just the dinner menu. However, the food was quite tasty! I enjoyed the filet Cobb salad and citrus salmon. For a birthday dessert, they did not comp it or even add a candle. This was my favorite spot to eat three years ago, now I would choose another restaurant in the area."}
{"text":"It seems I come here every 2 to 3 years.  I am not sure why I don't keep this place in my rotation more often.  I had a great meal tonight.   Of course I was with a great girlfriend who I haven't seen in a while so the whole evening was a lot of fun.  We had a couple of cocktails, I had the Moscow Mule, I asked them to add mint to mine and they did it perfectly.  My friend had the pomegranate martini.  Both were delicious.  For our meals I had the filet mignon cobb salad and she had the seared ahi salad.  I enjoyed my salad very much, it was nicely presented and the beef was very tasty.  To end we shared a French bread pudding.  Oh my, this was sinful and delicious, worth every single calorie."}
{"text":"First time here. Came here for Mother's Day. It was good. Pretty pricey. Make sure you make a reservation. I did, so we don't wait to long. The inside was nice and elegant. We got an appetizer with chips and spinach dip & salsa, it was good. I had the roasted chicken and ribs with potatoes and broccoli, everyone kept eating my broccoli I had to order another plate of broccoli"}
{"text":"Been here once before, though it'd been awhile so we stopped in on a Thursday evening (missed the Restaurant Week promotion by two days, but oh well).  One of the first things you'll notice inside is the bar with liquor bottles stacked to the top of the ceiling.  Cool and colorful little aesthetic touch.  The seating and atmosphere otherwise though is tough to distinguish from the other various finer dining establishments in the Scottsdale area.  We started off with the spinach and artichoke dip.  Gotta say I was less than impressed with it.  Generally I prefer this type of dip to be thicker and heartier, but the dip was pretty runny watered down for my taste.  It was passable, but unimpressive.  For the entrée I went on the lighter side got the citrus soy salmon and couscous.  Pretty good overall as the salmon was cooked adequately and the couscous was light and subtle.  For dessert my girlfriend and I tried two things.  We got the bread pudding and the white chocolate brownie.  Now these did not disappoint.  The white chocolate brownie was decadent, flaky, flavorful, and dense.  The bread pudding was huge and had croissants as the bread which gave it a great texture.  Overall I give this place a so-so rating for a couple of reasons.  As mentioned earlier, the atmosphere is relatively blah.  It's nice, but other than the bar setup, there's nothing unique or interesting about it.  The appetizer and entrée were good, but not worth the fairly pricey tab that came with them in my opinion.  The desserts though are very impressive and are worth saving room for.  And our server was very friendly and attentive.  If the rest of the experience matched the desserts, I'd give it a 5 star rating.  In the case though, I didn't feel we always got adequate value for the price."}
{"text":"This place never disappoints! My husband and I come here a lot and are always happy with the food. The service is OUTSTANDING!  It is one of the best ran restaurants I have ever been too! Waitress/waiters are always on point with managers constantly walking around monitoring every table. I've had the salads, burgers,steaks and chicken enchiladas.  I like to try something different Every time we go...but one thing that doesn't change is the amazing white chocolate brownie dessert WOW!!!"}
{"text":"Been here four times and have never had a bad meal or experience.  The food is delicious and the portions are generouse, service has always been perfect, and the restaurant itself is beautiful.  I've had Maytag burger  (blue cheese) served with spaghetti squash, wow, (I'm not even the biggest burger fan) it was incredible.  Had the grilled chicken salad for lunch one day and ate the whole, huge thing, couldn't get enough of it. Highly recommend WCG!"}
{"text":"Nothing to complain about.  The \"perfectly grilled salmon\" was actually perfectly grilled.  Great service.  It's just not a 4-5 star restaurant."}
{"text":"Is it wrong to update a review a lot?!   I went in and decided to try a new item other than my usual rotisserie chicken , which did I mention was like the most delicious thing ever?  For some reason I just wanted like a sandwich. I wouldn't think of them for a sammy(my girlfriend hates when I call them that)   I got the club BUT it isn't like other clubs. They actually rotisserie up the turkey themselves so it isn't shitty processed nitrate grossness.  it was moistest, non gamey, turkey ,the most crisp bacon,awesome cheddar and peppered tomatoes so damn good!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! I got it with no mustard or mayo and a side of BBQ.  The mustard I got on the side too. mayo is gross. But the BBQ I think they make, it is kinda fruity like cherries or something perfect to dip every other bite in.   The have crappy fries so dont get them as a side the mashed potatoes are very good and they added a speck of nutmeg and have a fresh thin jus from the chicken. They are really good and normally i would never order mashed potato's.  The cous cous is pretty good it has a cilantro yogurt sauce and raisins and pistachios. very pleasant ;)  I did try to get a burger once and I took it back, never get a burger. If the burger was good they would get 5 stars"}
{"text":"This place is amazing! Everything we ordered was perfect. The service was top notch too, Sarah was very attentive. Got raving reviews from some of the locals, so glad we ate here. We need one of these in Baltimore!"}
{"text":"I called to make a reservation for 6 people and I was told that, reservation for large party was no longer available. In a way, I am glad we are not eating there after reading about finding worms in the artichoke and insects crawling on the napkins.  Too bad... It was a decent place to eat."}
{"text":"Went to this place for the second time and it was really good! Got the special that night which was the rainbow trout and it was delicious!! Side of broccoli and carrots were delish as well. Then we got to dessert and it was absolutely delectable. All the food was very professionally put together and presented and our waitress was very attentive. Slightly fancy atmosphere and ambience which was nice. Will be returning!"}
{"text":"So I know the name is cheesy. But this place serves up a mean burger.   Too bad we didn't have more time to explore it for dinner, because it had a sweet looking bar filled to the ceilings with hard liquor. Dark ambiance filled with booths, a visible kitchen, and lots of lively conversation.  Yes, this place is known for fabulous white chocolate desserts. But dammit, that cheeseburger left room for absolutely NONE of that. It's sad, but true... we left here without eating a bite of anything that had white chocolate in it. Fail.  Caprese salad was surprisingly good, service was excellent, and did I mention the burger??? Try it, and please have some dessert for me. The WC bread pudding looked sinfully ass-packing-fat good."}
{"text":"We have visited this restaurant on several occasions and have been satisfied with the food.  Unfortunately, a couple of times we have been disappointed.  The manager has a very bad attitude which is basically lump it or leave it.  Once we sent our food back and they purposely burned it to a crisp and brought it back to our table.  This is not just us, a couple sitting next to us complained and they did the same thing to them.  My suggestion is don't go here for quality food and service.  Great restaurant, but management has an attitude!"}
{"text":"Been coming to WCG since right after they opened - how have I not reviewed it before now? This is one of my standard places to bring folks when we're looking for a nice and cool place to grab a bite.  It's great for lunch (good burgers and sandwiches at good prices - and the fries?  wow!)  Dinner is my favorite though - almost always goes something like this:  Appetizer - Seared Ahi - comes on a bed of slaw that's got curry(?) in it - heck, I'll not fight too hard for the Ahi if you let me have your share of the slaw!  It's that good (hey WCG - maybe make that a side dish?  :-))  If the crowd is big (or hungry), add the southwest egg rolls -they're also very good.  Main course - Balsamic Ribeye - marinated in a balsamic reduction (overnight, IIRC), then grilled to order - served with fresh tomato slices with some balsamic reduction drizzled on them - for the side, get the honey glazed carrots - best carrots ever!!!  Now for dessert - this gets tougher - the chocolate lovers will want to order the  Silky Chocolate Soufflé Cake - it's really amazing (and gluten free, if that's your thing), but...you can get something like that at a lot of places, so I'm going to recommend the (wait for it) the Freshly Baked Apple Pie.  Yes, I just said to order the apple pie because you can get something like the chocolate souffle cake lots of places...the apple pie isn't what you're thinking.  It's got a puff crust, not a normal pie crust.  The filling is pretty much what you'd expect - apples and cinnamon, then it's topped with caramel sauce and a scoop of vanilla ice cream (and littered with chopped walnuts).  The only way to make it better would be to add a second scoop of ice cream and offer a glass of milk to go with it.  Mmmmmm..."}
{"text":"The service was awesome and the atmosphere was fun.  It was a little dark inside for how light and bright it was outside... but I guess that's the atmosphere they are going for.  It's a loud and trendy restaurant... lots of wait staff so if your waiter is unavailable someone is ready to help you.  Our waiter, Ivan (I think?) was a good guy.... he was on top of refills and giving us excellent menu suggestions.  The food was aight.  I got the salmon and it would have been fine if the bottom of it wasn't burnt to a crisp.  Luckily I could scrape that part off.... but I was definitely disappointed.    I may try again in the future hoping for a meal that isn't on the burnt side."}
{"text":"The grill was good. Service was pretty good, food was pretty tasty, and the ambiance is nice.   We all had something different.  I had chicken crepes, very rich, lots of mushrooms, very tasty. Good job.  My boyfriend ordered a Prime Rib, which they were out of, and he ended up ordering another steak, which was tasty. My friend had a cobb salad. More items in the salad than lettuce, yummy, good job.  Her boyfriend had a prime rib dip. Which is made out of prime rib, which we were told they were out of. I guess it is pre made? Not sure. But the sandwich was really bland, definitely not the best dish on the menu.   Now, the mashed potatoes. I was NOT a fan. Who puts nutmeg or cloves in mashed potatoes and doesn't tell a person!?!? I see mashed potatoes and thing, YUM, butter, maybe milk, maybe cream, maybe even garlic. But nutmeg and cloves? Unless you like that, don't order the mashed potatoes.   Now, the not so tasty mashed potatoes also came with a hair. Doesn't totally gross me out, but isn't pleasant. I asked for mashed potatoes to go, hoping I would like them later, but nope I did not. However, the manager comped some desserts and whatnot to make up for it. We did not ask for this, so I am assuming he did because we were really nice and easy going about the whole matter.   So, although parts of the dishes I would not order again, because of the other food, the service, and the overall care of the manager (generosity as well), I would definitely go back.   The desserts we had wereL: A chocolate souffle thing, which was yummy, and a banana thing, which I personally was \"meh\" about, but my friend LOVED it. Thanks wcg!"}
{"text":"My husband and I normally really have a great dinner experience but tonight I can't stand feeling rushed. Our main course arrived while we were still eating our salads and they were left on the table getting cold while we had to rush and eat our salads. Then during our meal my husband needed another drink And no one came around. Then the check came before we even finished our dinner....not cool we will not be back ."}
{"text":"Had dinner here for the first time and we will definitely be back.  Our server Seth was the best I've had in a while. He knew everything about the menu and made great recommendations. I'm surprised we hadn't heard more about this place before. The crab cakes are fantastic, as were our drinks. Very enjoyable dinner!"}
{"text":"Called tonight to get a two dinners for take out.  I was told they couldn't do take outs because they were too busy!  Go figure, not good on the customer service scale"}
{"text":"Went there last night for dinner because hubby had a gift card. It was quite a drive from where we live in Gilbert - the restaurant is near the 101 and Scottsdale Rd. The decor is very nice, with dark woods and booth seating - like many other reviewers it kind of reminded me of Houston's but not quite as stuffy. Their dining room is quite large and they have a large bar area as well. We only had to wait about 20 minutes on a Saturday night, but we were there pretty early too. Service level was just right - we were always attended to but didn't feel like we were being rushed.  Their menu had many great selections but hubby and I decided on their limited-menu \"Date Night Special\" for $29 per person. We split an artichoke dip appetizer, each got our own salads and entrees, and split dessert.   Our salads were just OK - I had the blue cheese WCG salad which I thought would be more like the yummy wedge salads you can get at some places. It was more of a mixed green salad with vinaigrette dressing and sparingly-added bleu cheese and pecans.   I was actually impressed at the many entree selections on their special menu. I decided on the bleu cheese filet and hubby got the crab cakes, each with mashed potatoes. We both thoroughly enjoyed our selections and ate every bite.  For our shared dessert we chose the white chocolate brownie which is their signature. It's a delicious hot blondie brownie with a few chocolate chips, topped with rich vanilla bean ice cream, chocolate syrup and a few shavings of white chocolate. YUM - it was so good even my husband (who's not big on sweets) ate as much as me. We were fighting for the last bite!  Overall food was very good and the value was excellent with this special. I do think we could have had a dinner just as nice closer to home so I doubt we will be back - it's not worth a special trip for us. Still, we were very happy and in fact stuffed when we left!  It's a great place to celebrate a birthday or take your mom when she comes for a visit. You would be comfortable wearing jeans with a dressy shirt, or you would also fit in if wearing a dress or jacket. Great place if you just want to have dessert, too."}
{"text":"After having written the review below we received a message from the restaurant stating that they were very sorry for our poor service and wanted to send us some gift certificates so that we would return and hope we would have a better experience. After having received 2-$25 gift certificates we returned on a Friday for lunch and sat in the bar area. The service was wildly better versus our dinner experiences. We ordered beverages and then two of us proceeded to change seating positions. The server remembered who had what and gave us each the right beverage. That was an impressive moment. We all ordered soup and or salads and were very pleased with both the flavor and quantity for the price. The wedge salad was very substantial and a Caesar salad served as part of the soup and salad combo was enormous. Both had very flavorful dressings as others have mentioned.   We will return again in the future to try some of their sandwiches at lunchtime.  ---------------------------  We ate here on Sunday and then again on Thursday with different couples. See attached receipts.  The food is very, very good here. The service however needs a lot of work. Our first server on Sunday, Maxwell, had an almost snarky attitude. He definitely sounded and looked like he did not want to be there. When the server has a almost condescending, nasty tone in their voice you know that something is wrong either with that person or management.  Thursday we had dinner and were quickly seated at our table and approached by our server Ryan. He seemed very nice and we told him we needed a few minutes because we had not seen each other in a very long time and we were going to be chatting for a few minutes. When we did finally order he almost looked like a deer in the headlights when answering questions about the menu and listening to my request for extra crushed red pepper for my jambalaya which he said was not spicy.  After he left we realized we wanted to order bread, so it took at least seven or eight minutes to snare him and ask him to bring some. Another 10 to 15 minutes went by and lo and behold our dinner is being served and the bread has not yet arrived. We asked the server who was dropping off the entrées and he said with a not so nice attitude \"that is baked to order, so it takes a little while\", to which I responded that we ordered it quite some time ago.  About five minutes later the same server came back and said the bread was on its way. Our server Ryan finally showed up to see if everything was okay and I reminded him that I had requested crushed red pepper when I had placed my order, to which he looked at me with wide eyes and then ran away to go get it, and that return trip took at least three or four more minutes again.  In the meantime while we were waiting for the bread, that didn't arrive until after our entrées were served, Ryan had asked if anyone wanted another drink and one of us asked for a second beer. That beer did not arrive until we were almost done eating our entrées easily 15 minutes after the order for that drink had been taken.  Then we ordered dessert. You're not gonna believe what happened next, the bill came before the desserts were even served. Clearly unacceptable we took the check and put it by the salt-and-pepper shakers and did not look at it until we were good and ready to pay the bill.  We know this place has good food and reasonable prices but the service needs work and trying to herd you out of there like cattle is unacceptable. Management needs to work on these aspects especially with these two servers.  Am not going to comment on the food because everyone else has touched on everything we ate."}
{"text":"This place really is as good as it gets.   I don't really understand how anyone can give this place any less than 5 stars.   Lets start off with walking in.....The place is great...warm and cozy, beautifully decorated,  very clean.   The kitchen has the open glass view so you can see the kitchen staff working.   The hostesses are very attentive along with the wait staff.  You can tell the place has great management.  And now for the food.   Its delicious.   From the appetizers to desserts this place is 5 stars.   one main thing I love about WCG is that the food is always consistent.   I hate certain places where you order something and it comes out good one time and the second time it tastes different or not as good.   Not with WCG.  Its always great.   And the desserts are to die for.  Especially the white chocolate brownie.  I read a review on here where someone said \"I know its the white chocolate grill, but cant they have something other than white chocolate for dessert\"  How could you write that?  You go to a place called the white chocolate grill and your gonna complain about the white chocolate desserts?  Whats next?! are you gonna go to an italian restaurant and complain cuz they serve pasta?  Are you gonna go to a steakhouse and complain cuz they serve steaks?   Next time don't order dessert.   This place is fantastic.  Decor, ambiance, service, and Food.   A plus!"}
{"text":"This is hands down one of my boyfriend's and my favorite place to eat. It has the best French Dip I've ever had. The au jus is flavorful too. Then I usually get their mashed potatoes with extra good gravy. It's super delicious. My boyfriend usually gets the Salmon New Orleans with fries and loves it and practically licks the plate. Then usually we finish off with the White Chocolate Raspberry Cheesecake. Definitely the best cheesecake we've ever had. I've also had the white chocolate brownie. It's literally white. This place is top notch. Very professional staff and nice bathrooms. We usually have to park out far but that's okay."}
{"text":"I really wish I could rate their food and their desserts differently using the yelp 'stars', but sadly I can't.  More on that in a bit.  One of the first things you notice about this place when you step in the door is how strikingly it resembles 'Houstons' -- the set of chain restaurants.   As other reviewers have pointed out, they really seem to want to emulate this chain.    Badly.    The interior is cool and dark, they have the same style Houstons high-back booths, and even the menu is pretty much the same.  Right down to the thin-cut fries!    I ordered their club sandwich and fries (because I have little faith in 'trendy' restaurants that serve American fare -- and I figured it would be hard to screw up a club sandwich).  I was pleasantly surprised by their version of a club -- with hand cut turkey and apple-smoked bacon.  It was 'good' -- not 'excellent-and-I-need-to-come-back-here-to-enjoy-this-again'.  Where the White Chocolate Grill really shines is in its dessert selection.  Their desserts are quite good.  A bit more expensive than most places, but they give you large portions.  I ordered the 'White Chocolate Banana Cream Pie' and was surprised to get not a slice -- but a whole small pie!  The pie WAS 'excellent-and-I-need-to-come-back-here-to-enjoy-this-again'.  Its served cold over a very thick (and tasty) graham cracker crust, with shavings of white chocolate as garnish on top.  And man, if you like white chocolate you'll be in heaven in this place.  5 out of the 6 desserts offered by the White Chocolate grill have white chocolate in them.  I would give their desserts 4 stars, and their food 3 stars.    Definitely come here if you want a place to take a date for dessert and a coffee."}
{"text":"We have enjoyed The White Chocolate Grill (WCG) many times, both for Happy Hour and for dinner. Our experiences have been universally good.  We came here last week after church for Easter Sunday around 2-ish for dinner.  We had made our reservations on Open Table/Yelp and our booth was waiting for us when we arrived.  Actually, the WCG was only half full at the time after a busy brunch, but it was nice having the hostess escort us over to our table by the window.  Our water glasses were filled, as we sat looking at our menus.  Heather our server came by giving us the Specials of the day.  The three of us decided to skip the wine list, opting instead for Ice Tea.  It had already been a long day, and any alcohol would have put us to sleep.  We started by sharing the Ahi Tuna Salad for $14.95.  WCG normally sears it with a sesame crust which is very good, but today we asked them not to cook it but serve it raw.  There is something about raw ahi tuna, in their champagne vinaigrette that speaks to me.  Today was no different, it was very nicely done.  For dinner we order, the End Cut Prime Rib for $24.99, the Baby Back Rib for $21.99, and the Balsamic Rib Eye for $26.89.  Each of us had a bite of the others and we were very happy with our selections.    The Rib Eye was not what you would have expected, in so far as it was not a piece of prime rib without the bone, but instead two small 7' cutlets cooked in a glazed balsamic reduction sauce.  Very nice.   The Baby Backs were as you would expect, as was the End Cut.  For dessert, we ordered the Bread Pudding for $7.59 and the house special Silky Chocolate Soufflé Cake also $7.59.  We also had some coffee for $2.49 and a Cappuccino for $2.99.  In my Yelp Tip, I mentioned the Bread Pudding as being exceptional and it is,  I know on some cooking shows, it looks like just day old bread and a cream sauce of some kind.  But at WCG, the sauce is almost Creme Brulle-ish and it really is out of this world.    The total damage came to $116.00, before tax of $10.79 and tip; which seemed fair for three people.  One of things we like to do is go to a movie at the nearby Harkin's Cine Capri and stop at WCG for dessert afterwards.  We really had a nice time at the WCG on Easter and we will certainly recommend them.  Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Really excellent service and great food. Good ambiance as well. I highly recommend this restaurant!"}
{"text":"I have dined at WCG before and attempted to make plans for my group of friends and I to celebrate a birthday there.   Unfortunately, WCG does not accomodate parties greater than 4. You will have to wait until tables become available as they will not even take a reservation for anything greater than party of 4. No, this isn't advertised on their website. Seriously...and in this economy? Really?  Keep this in mind as you all are preparing for your holiday celebrations and go somewhere where your business is appreciated.  I sent them a copy of the receipt from our party of 9's  dinner elsewhere to the corporate offices to let them know what they missed out on. I doubt they will care as Jillian, the hostess who answered the phone when I called about our reservation was completely unfettered  to lose our business. Absurd."}
{"text":"The food was delicious, the service was great, the atmosphere was amazing. I would definitely come back.  I took my team there for lunch to celebrate the holidays.  It was a little pricey, but I expected that.  We had a great time in a place that was just made for comfy beautiful dining."}
{"text":"The White Chocolate Grill never disappoints. Sure, the ambiance is nice, the servers are awesome, and the location is great as it is located on the brink of north Scottsdale, but the highlight of my most recent visit was sinking my chompers into a juicy, fall-off-the-bone rack of baby back ribs with fresh mashed potatoes and french fries to compliment (I'm all about potatoes, but different sides may be chosen). I'm crazy about this place alright; I'd even be crazy enough to say that the artichoke dip beats Oregano's Boom Dip as it does not have any oil or grease - ftw! And then there's the white chocolate brownie a la mode that is totally drizzled in milk chocolate, totally covered with white chocolate shavings, and totally worth the entire trip alone. Can I get a \"yes please\"?  My only other thoughts: 1) Why isn't there more white chocolate on the menu? 2) There was no puff to my chocolate souffle, which would've made worlds of a difference as souffle loosely translates into \"puff up\". Regardless, puff or no puff, this may not be the best chocolate souffle out there, but it still makes a damn good chocolate lava cake. 3) Service is great - my water never gets beyond the halfway mark :)"}
{"text":"One of our ALL time favorite places to treat ourselves on date nights! We love this place. Service is always great and team oriented, the atmosphere is extremely pleasant, and the food is always exceptional. Two thumbs up."}
{"text":"We received a gift card for The White Chocolate Grill over Christmas and decided to make a reservation for dinner in March.  Good thing we made a reservation as this place was packed!  I enjoyed a flirtini (well mixed and so deliciously good) with an order of the AZ egg rolls - wow, delicious!  I enjoyed the rotisserie chicken crepes for my entree and enjoyed every single bite.  We shared an apple pie for dessert - not bad, but probably my least favorite part of the meal.    The atmosphere is living and sophisticated and the service was excellent too!  The bar was packed, so I assume they must have a pretty great happy hour.  Definitely worth a visit if staying in the area!"}
{"text":"Yummy! The chicken salad with goat cheese is a favorite of my whole family! I live in California and hope for WCG to make its way there. Delicious!"}
{"text":"Incredible!!!!! Food Service Ambiance Parking  All incredible !!!!! You will love it. Try the Prime Rib French dip."}
{"text":"This type of restaurant concept has been done to death...mediocre bar-and-grill food, nice decor, with a white-chocolate variation on the theme.  The service is decent, but these kind of restaurants are a dime a dozen...no real character.  Someone could put up a sign with \"Cheesecake Factory\" or \"CPK\" the next day, and people would probably hardly notice.  The benefits of going to a place like this though, is that it's bland enough that it wouldn't offend anyone if you have a larger group.  Their one unusually unique appetizer though was their tomato gin soup...honestly never had anything like it, and that was interesting enough with a nice kick.  I was hoping for same kick in their bread budding, and was quite disappointed."}
{"text":"Great place, love there chicken/ avocado salad.. very yummy. Nice ambiance, the hostess was a little off but I get it it's a starting position."}
{"text":"One of our favorite restaurants in North Scottsdale. Their food is incredible, and their salads are some of the best I've ever had. If going on the weekend, plan to see a line because this place is always packed.   I highly recommend you try it if you haven't yet"}
{"text":"While on vacation my fiancé and I were looking for a nice place to have a great dinner and this was it! All these reviews helps so much to choose this terrific restaurant. We both ended up ordering a fillet mine topped with blue cheese and his with Parmesan. How they cooked those fillets perfectly at medium rare and got them to the table piping hot is beyond me - but they did. The mashed potatoes or incredible, perfectly seasoned and the right consistency. I ordered the brussels sprouts as a side dish and oh my gosh, I could've eaten a big bowl of these they were so delicious. I have never had them prepared that way and if were ever in Scottsdale again will be back and I'll order the exact same items !  We couldn't resist the desert for two menu and chose the white chocolate banana cream pie. This wasn't like grandma or Marie calendars makes.   This was a crunchy graham cracker and chocolate chunk crust with fresh sliced bananas,  vanilla cream custard and whipped cream with Carmel sauce and shaved white chocolate .  My fiancé was thrilled that I was so full from dinner that I could only eat a few bites a dessert and he had to polish off the rest!   The ambiance is casual but nice and romantic at the same time. The wood walls and dark ceiling with low lighting is so relaxing compared to those bright, sterile restaurants. You can see the kitchen and wait staff through an entire glass wall - they were smiling and laughing. It looked like they were enjoying working there as much as we were enjoying our evening meal.  The service was exceptional from the moment we walked in until we left. Dine here! Celebrate here! You'll be so glad you did!"}
{"text":"Went there for there happy our and I must say. I was extremely impressed. I got the ribs platter for 8 dollars. Came with a decent half rack and some fries. Next time I want to try there bread pudding."}
{"text":"A disappointing evening at the white chocolate grill. Apps were good, my salad was fresh and tasty and the bread pudding dessert was amazing. Unfortunately my balsamic ribeye came out completely raw.. I ordered it medium rare and it wasn't even close. I mentioned it to our server who agreed with me and took it away. I would have been happy if they offered me a free dessert at this point but they put the already thin piece of meat back on the grill, burnt it and brought it back out with some fresh rice and fresh balsamic drizzled on it. I assumed a new steak was coming but I paid 26 bucks for an entree that was minimally edible both times it was brought out. I was surprised because I have had good experiences here in the past, and I should know better than to order a steak in a non-steakhouse..its my fiance/professional chef who insists I complain.. I just can't imagine Ruth's or Mastro's putting a served raw steak back on the grill, burning it to a crisp and re-serving it.."}
{"text":"I'm kicking myself for going to WCG and not getting a white chocolate brownie!   The whole reason I love this place is for their brownies. My husband and I went here yesterday for lunch and decided we were going to get a brownie to split. Too bad we got full on our lunch or we would have.   This time, I tried the Quinoa burger with fries and he got a Turkey Club, also with fries. I liked my burger a lot, but I still prefer their split turkey sandwich with gravy.   Our waitress was friendly and kept water & tea glasses full. I feel bad that I forgot her name already, but she was awesome.   Next time we're back, we'll definitely split something and THEN get a brownie. Lol"}
{"text":"This place has a great atmosphere, perfect for dates, groups, and girl's night! I came with my parents for a family dinner. We came on a Friday night without a reservation in mid-July, and had only a 15-20 minute wait. We got drinks at the bar and hung out. At some of the tables in the bar area, you can seat yourself if they're open. A waiter came and let us know, which was really nice of him. We ended up being beat to the table, but we weren't worried!  I enjoyed a pomegranate martini. It was delicious, and I love that they bring you a chilled glass about halfway through. Totally unnecessary, but TOTALLY appreciated! We shared the spinach/artichoke dip as an app. Yummy! I had the bleu cheese crusted filet, which was perfectly prepared. Dad had the ribs/chicken combo and thought the ribs were surprisingly good for a non-barbeque place. Mom had some kind of salad, and it was huge. When she was done, she barely looked like she touched it. We tried the White chocolate banana cream pie.... it was a little weird. Came on a crust that looked like a cookie. Dad said it was okay, but then.... I noticed a very small hair on the whipped cream. We quietly told the waitress, who immediately apologized and offered another. Since we weren't impressed, we declined. She comped the desert and our appetizer.  Food was great, drinks were great, desert was just fine. Service is where WCG shined. We were really impressed with the way the waitress and the manager treated this hair. Probably 4 apologies total... It was nice to NOT be blown off for a small complaint, or made to feel like we were making a big deal.  I would definitely return! Yumm!!"}
{"text":"Great selection of contemporary american cuisine. They do great things with their veggies, have several good salads, an amazing French Dip and Turkey French Dip, and do wonders with both their fish entrees. Desserts are quality and the ambiance is great. Only complaint is that they have no seating options for large groups."}
{"text":"We had an awesome night, and great meals!! Very highly impressed. They have excellent service w/ drinks and food. We ordered 2 desserts and shared them, and were AMAZING!! (Michelle was our waitress) Highly recommended:)"}

{"text":"My family and I just had a wonderful experience! From the time we were greeted by the hostess, to the time we were sat at our table, to the time we were greeted by our server and then when we received our food. The staff was extremely friendly, efficient, and welcoming throughout our entire experience. Our food was prepared perfectly, seasoned excellently, and was thoroughly enjoyable. We ended with an amazing dessert that we shared, definitely plan to come back! Our server Mal was phenomenal!!"}
{"text":"This was my 3rd time here and I'm really starting to like this place.  I really like the decor which is pretty dimly lit, modern, etc.   It has a really nice vibe and looks almost exactly like Houstons.  The service was excellent, the food came out quickly and everything was very tasty.  Here are the highlights I would go back for in an instant:  * Grilled Artichokes - they were excellent and so was the aioli they serve it with * WGC Bacon Blue Cheese Salad - excellent and even the \"side\" salad portion was sizable * Honey Roasted Carrots - I never thought I would actually like to eat carrots but these were phenomenal and an excellent side * Corn Salad - this was also an excellent side.  Fresh cut corn off the cob with some other stuff in a light dressing.  Very very good.  I ordered some steak thing that was a special.  It wasn't memorable so next time I'm going to stick to what is on the regular menu.  My wife ordered the trout and it was excellent.  I have to say thought my favorite was their bread pudding.  Wow.  Just Wow.  I want that for dinner next time."}
{"text":"I felt way under dressed in my jeans.  A very nice ambiance and I enjoyed our meal.  I had the filet mignon cobb salad and it was the perfect dinner.  The meat was so tender and the combination of additional ingredients was delicious.  (I did not have the bacon on it.)  The friends I enjoyed dinner with had: Ahi Salad (did not look as good as mine) Jumbalya (not my thing but looked pretty good) Prime Rib (had a very large bone) Roasted Chicken (didn't look good to me) Stacked Chicken Enchiladas (looked really good) carrots (good) broccoli (okay)  Had the bread pudding for dessert and it was amazing!!!  So good.  The brownie looked okay.  The service was pretty good.  Drink refills were slow and dessert took forever after we ordered it.  The waiter was very friendly though."}
{"text":"I had never heard of this restaurant before and was introduced by some business associates.   We came for lunch with a party of 8. We were seated in the back patio in a semi-private area.   Our server was great and we had a good meal. Most of the girls had the salads (all gigantic sized) and most of the men had sandwiches and things of that nature.  They had lemonade which I had and it was just okay. I had asked if they could flavor it and was looked at like I had asked if they could add alcohol to it. Usually in Seattle, you can get a strawberry lemonade, etc so I didn't think my request was too strange but apparently it is in AZ.   The atmosphere was nice and I can see it being a good spot for happy hour. The interior bar area definitely had a hip feel to it."}
{"text":"I am not sure how this particular restaurant has reached such rave reviews to warrant an average of 4 stars. The appetizer was okay (seared ahi tuna), but I've had better. The culinary experience only got worse from there. Our entrees were either too salty (I was chomping on himalayan salt bits on each scallop- a bit much) or overly cooked. The Arnold Palmer was WAY too sweet. I can only imagine what the cocktails would have tasted like. As we were there to finally try the desserts others have raved about, unfortunately the bread pudding was cool (as in cold and not warm or gooey), the white chocolate sauce overdone, and overall did not please the palate. Service was good. It was a busy night, however this should not have excused the problems with the food.  We will not be dining here again."}
{"text":"Went here with my boyfriend for our anniversary. Top notch. We both got coffee Jameson's to start out. Both of our drinks were very strong and that is NEVER a problem. I also got a vodka water and it was very strong. Drinks here are great!  As for food.. I got the Cajun chicken sandwich with a side of fries. The sandwich was pretty amazing! The fries are shoestring style and tasted amazing. My boyfriend got the prime rib and said it was absolutely perfect.  We got the white chocolate brownie for dessert.. Definitely one of the best desserts I've ever had! And I'm a sweet food enthusiast ;)  Our waitress was Tara and she was great! Service was a bit on the slow side, but it was Saturday so rah is to be expected.   Overall superb experience and we will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"The food was good but definitely average. We waited a long time to put in our order, and it took just as long to order dessert and get our checks. The only above average part of our experience there was the white chocolate raspberry cheesecake. To die for!"}
{"text":"I have been here a few times for both lunch and dinner....and I will keep coming back. Its in a great location to have dinner and a movie, since the Cine Capri is a stones throw away. Their menu is the only one that I have seen that starts listing the desserts first!! HELLO - I think they are onto something here! My recommendations:  the Blackend Fish Sandwich The Mahi Mahi Rainbow Trout (yeah I like my fish...living in the desert!) Parmesan Filet  The service has always been great. I really like the interior  - wood from floor to celiing and the lighting is a good mood-setter. Thumbs Up for me!!!"}
{"text":"We had a wonderful experience eating at The White Chocolate Grill.    We decided to come during restaurant week to take advantage of the special menu. My husband and I both had the prime rib which was delicious!  Our spinach dip appetizer and the white chocolate brownie dessert were both also amazing.   But I think what made me enjoy this place so much was how great the service was.  I waited tables for many years so I'm kinda picky about service and our server was top notch. Our food and drinks arrived quickly, we never had to ask for a refill and our server was very knowledgeable about the specials going on for restaurant week.    Great place to go on a date night!"}
{"text":"A huge thank you to Manager Lindsay for quickly resolving our issue tonight. We have been going to this White Chocolate Grill for many years now. We always have a great experience. Tonight was the first night where we had a problem with our food not coming out correctly. Lindsay kindly resolved the issue for us quickly. Both Lindsay and our server Sarah are wonderful assets to this company!  Thank you so much!"}
{"text":"Our Server Sarah (Short hair) was very pleasant and attentive.  My girlfriend and I dined at lunch on a Thursday in the heat of late July and they were moderately busy.  It seemed like a lot of business lunch and early retirees.  All the servers helped to fill drinks which I thought was great because most restaurants have servers who are snippy/greedy about their tips and only care to serve their own tables/needs.  The teamwork here really helped to elevate the service.  Great decor, not too dark but dark enough to create the right ambiance for this upscale American food.  Healthy comfort food.  The appetizer special was the double dip which came with freshly fried tortilla chips and jalapeno queso dip/salsa/guacamole.  Great portion.  Good dips!   For Entree it was the Filet mignon Cobb Salad for her, and the Spinach Kale salad for me.  House made dressings really make a salad and theirs were on point.  The filet cobb had a bite from the intense bleu cheese they put on the plate but combined with the steak and their red wine vinaigrette with marinated mushrooms, it was so good!  The tanginess from the asian dressing on the kale salad worked well with their strawberries and sesame seeds.  I believe the kale was either quickly blanched or massaged into submission to lend it's mellow and comforting texture.  This is crucial for a kale salad otherwise you'll be looking like a dinosaur trying to conquer those big leaves.  Great place and my girl and I will definitely remember this place and be sure to be back!"}
{"text":"Great food and service prices r fair. And I would go back. The drinks r strong and kept coming."}
{"text":"Ate here for lunch on a weekday. Parking lot was packed! Although I had been here years prior, I couldn't remember what the bar area looked like, or if it was accommodating for a quick lunch on a weekday. Long bar area with a lot of lone people grabbing lunch, so it was perfect.  Asked for the Gluten Free menu and was pleasantly surprised at the selection! I \"think\" that they may actually make the GF items in a separate area of the kitchen. Had the caprese salad, and it was delicious. Also had Tomato Gin Soup (House Specialty) Fire roasted tomatoes, cream, mushrooms and smoked bacon. Topped with Tanqueray Gin. Both were delish. Only had iced tea, so the bill came out under $20 bucks.  Can't wait to go back again for dinner and try some other GF options with a nice glass of wine. Thanks to other Yelpers for letting me know about the GF options here... I never would've known!"}
{"text":"Love the food but have issues with the service almost every time we come here.  Ahi tuna salad is amazing!  Filet Cobb salad is amazing!  Fire Roasted Turkey Dip is amazing - instead of gravy I sub out for the au jus from the french dip sandwich or you can just get the french dip... its amazing!  Got the burger once... just okay.. nothing special.  Love the very thin french fries and the garlic green beans are sometimes the daily vegetable... yummy in my tummy if I choose to sub out fries and be a little healthier.  People love the carrots... they are carmelized and sweet if you like that.  Definitely a must for just about anyone...  prices are mid to high.  Salads are Ahi - $13.99 and filet one is $15.99 during lunch.  Haven't been there for dinner so not sure about that.  Nice decor...  gives you a nice upscale feeling without being snobby."}
{"text":"I wish I could tell you how awesome their entree's are but I can't. We had an awesome appetizer and a dessert to die for!!! To say they were good would be a lie. I might sell my husband just for another brownie!! If you looking for great dessert you HAVE to try this place!!!"}
{"text":"My husband and I have been to WCG several times. We've been to the one in Denver and the one in Scottsdale, never have we ever had such poor service. My husbands boss was in town and we love eating here and his boss (Scot) had never even heard of it so that's where we picked. The waitress started off terrible and got worse. The waitress asks if we knew what we wanted and I told her to give us a minute if she would please because Scot had never been there and he proceeds to tell her that he'd never been and he was happy to be there where she replies with huh, you picked here? Here white castle, whatever, I guess I should be happy you picked a place where I work. WHOA!!! I was so embarrassed, she ends the night by tossing the booklet with the check in it, on the table and says I'll be back when you're ready, two min later comes back and tries to pick up the booklet where its still sitting when she tossed it. Scot tells her we're not ready yet as we're still working on our dessert. Needless to say, Scot puts his card in the booklet and hands it to a different waitress to take care of, which she did, thankfully. I will definitely NOT be taking anyone back there again. So disappointed."}
{"text":"Did I die and go to dessert heaven? White chocolate is my favorite edible thing and their desserts definitely deliver. My favorite is the white chocolate banana cream pie. Get it... you won't be sorry. I have also had the pleasure of trying the white chocolate brownie and white chocolate bread pudding, both amazing as well.   As far as the restaurant and food itself... the food is good for a \"high-ish end\" chain grill. I had the Parmesan crusted steak (it was cooked perfectly) and my garlic mashed potatoes were fabulous but let me talk about the appetizer. I was pregnant the last time we went, so it could be the hormones talking BUT I know a good artichoke when I get one. It's not many places you can order a grilled artichoke appetizer and this place made me one extremely happy pregnant lady because it was one of the best I've ever had."}
{"text":"I've only been here once but I remember it being very good. It's not the most trendiest spot and sort of has a franchise-e feel to it, but I'd come here again for sure granted my meal is being paid for."}
{"text":"White Chocolate Grill was outstanding in every respect. The staff was very friendly, the food was outstanding and the whiskey list was top notch.   A buddy and I decided to grab some appetizers and drinks here after work and sat at the bar tables. The service was fantastic and the staff timed the arrival of the food perfectly. Each subsequent appetizer arrived just as we'd completed the previous one. The servers were very attentive and friendly without appearing overbearing. Overall, the menu provided a variety of choices to meet all tastes and budgets.   In regards to the cocktail menu it's very extensive, particularly the whiskey list. They have an excellent selection of bourbons at very reasonable prices. Along with our food we spent the evening enjoying a variety of selections from the whiskey list.   Overall, we had a fantastic experience at a White Chocolate Grill and this has become one of my new favorites when I'm in the Scottsdale/Phoenix area. This place certainly deserves a try!"}
{"text":"Oh dear God, people should NOT compare this to CPK or Cheesecake Factory. Yeah, okay, it's themed around white chocolate. Does that make it bad? No. WCG serves decent food in a nice atmosphere that doesn't give off the mass produced feel of those other places.  And just to clear things up, only the desserts incorporate the namesake ingredient. You won't be seeing any white chocolate shavings on your filet.   Last night we had the chicken madeira, the blackened fish sandwich, and a chicken caesar salad. For dessert we tried the white chocolate raspberry cheesecake. Overall everything was pretty good. The chicken and fish were cooked perfectly. The madeira sauce on the chicken was thick with mushrooms.   The mashed potatoes were different. They have a hint of nutmeg or cinnamon, and the gravy is more of jus with peppery flavor. I liked it, but my brother didn't.  The cheesecake was good. Not the best, but good. The graham cracker crust and white chocolate shavings made it. Coulda used more raspberry.  I'll be going back. But I will be making a reservation. The wait is pretty crazy on the weekends."}
{"text":"I had already made dinner and we ate for the night but then decided to look up some places for a quick dessert.  I love chocolate so this place stood out to us.   The food was phenomenal and the white chocolate martini Is the best martini I've ever had !  We'll be coming back for sure. :-)"}
{"text":"One of my favorite places to go for a nice dinner! The service is always great and I've never ordered anything less than amazing :) definitely recommend the ribs and the white chocolate brownie. SO GOOD!"}
{"text":"I've never had a bad experience at White Chocolate. I've been here countless times, and the food and service has always been top notch. I don't think I've even had a \"pretty good\" meal here; it's always \"very good.\"  Here's something I recently discovered: the Guacamole here is amazing. Who knew!? It's not even a Mexican restaurant!  My current favorite dish is the Prime Rib French Dip sandwich. Mmm! But, like I said above, I've never had a bad meal here. Forays onto other parts of the menu have always yielded tasty results.  I'm a fan. I will undoubtedly be back."}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite spots in north Scottsdale. I've been coming here with my family for a long time, and it's always a welcome treat.   I would 10/10 recommend their filet mignon cobb salad...it's perfect! Their cheeseburger is also TO DIE FORRR...and it's totally worth it. My family always used to give me a hard time for ordering \"just a cheesburger,\" but let me tell ya, it's not \"just\" a cheeseburger. It's amazing, cooked to perfection, cheesy, flavorful deliciousness.   What I really love about this place is the bar and the desserts. First of all, the bar is just pretty to look at - it lines a whole wall up to the ceiling and it's filled with backlit colorful bottles. It really gives the place a cool vibe. They make super good drinks, and they're pretty strong. And for dessert...I don't think you could go wrong here, but the white chocolate brownie takes the cake. Make sure you check it out!   The vibe is upscale and classy, but I've seen everything from athleisure to suits and ties and prom dresses, so it's really just come-as-you-are. The service is always great, even when they are super busy. I've never had a bad experience here.   Check it out!"}
{"text":"Went here for the first time this weekend on Saturday night with some friends. The place was packed. Great ambience and excellent and prompt service. I had fried artichokes for an appetizer and the Filet Mignon Cobb Salad. They were both excellent choices but the dessert blew me away! I'm from the South and have tried lots of bread puddings but the White Chocholate Bread Pudding was by far the best I've tried! Will definitely be going back soon!"}
{"text":"This is a pretty solid joint. A little pricey, but it's worth it if you're eating with the right folks. The summer corn salad was the 5-star feature of this meal in my view. It occasionally happens that a side dish outshines the main attraction, and this definitely fit the bill.  Not that my main dish was bad: the chicken crepes had a pretty catchy sauce to them, and they were cooked really nicely.  The place was a little noisy, but that's a fair price to be paid. Yum."}
{"text":"A local suggested The White Chocolate Grill for our late-nite sweet tooth. Their menu specifies \"dessert for two,\" so I can't explain the 1:1 person to dessert ratio at our table. These sugary mountains of fat & carbs are under $8 each & are perfect examples of quantity over quality. We tried:   -- silky chocolate soufflé cake: did not try, but got a feeling this one was the least popular of the trio  -- white chocolate banana creme pie: this was my pick because...bananas & white chocolate *insert girl motioning \"duh\" emoji* Large white chocolate shavings were a dessert all on their own. Pastry creme & whipped cream melted quickly, & caramel was overwhelming.  -- white chocolate raspberry cheesecake: again, overloaded with caramel sauce & whipped cream. Soft, overly sweet, but plenty of raspberry flavor.   I wouldn't recommend. However, if you've got a group to feed on a budget & no one is too particular, this may be a restaurant to consider."}
{"text":"Hi Everybody,  Just a follow-up to my previous review. I'm officially blown away.  Within 24 hours of my posting that review, I got a note from the WCG apologizing for the experience and asking me to come back in. They sent over a gift card and we trucked on over.  I'm happy to say that everything positive from my last review, and the burgers were back to normal. \"Normal\" meaning \"excellent,\" of course.   I've never *ever* noted a restaurant performing like this, both in terms of customer service and follow-up, and in terms of their taking ownership of a problem. Of course, it helps a lot that the problem was completely resolved when we went back. :-)  This is my go-to place when I have out of town guests, and it's still our go-to place when we're looking for a quiet wind-down. Kudos!"}
{"text":"Bravo!! Absolutely phenomenal salad menu!! The wait staff works as a team so there is absolutely no wanting for anything, it's always at the table before you need it. The Fillet Minion Cobb Salad was incredible, very filling and the GF had a Cajun Chicken Sandwich that she said was very good. The salad though... the meet was perfectly cooked, the blue cheese was good, the addition of the cooked mushrooms though brought the steak into the Cobb salad and it was all finished with a delicious house made vinaigrette that was perfect."}
{"text":"This place was a nice find in the Scottsdale area. The area is chain ridden, so you could pick any number of places. I saw the decent reviews on Yelp and gave this a try. We sat on the back patio, which was dark, but gave a nice romantic atmosphere. The food was very good, as well as dessert. Wait staff were friendly. Overall great experience!"}
{"text":"The food here is just okay. The service is okay as well. There's really no \"oomph\" to anything here, especially for the prices, which I find to be a bit high.   I've been here a few different times, and once got the chopped salad and the other got the club sandwich. Chopped salad was of decent portion size, however didn't have any wow factor. Club sandwich was a little better, but like I mentioned, nothing to be amazed about.   One time I came here with my boyfriend and he ordered the filet mignon salad and said it was really good, which is a plus.   Other than that, certainly average."}
{"text":"I took some clients there and it was a nice place for a business lunch. I had the Citrus-Soy Glazed Salmon and the roasted beets with walnuts and goat cheese and it was excellent.  It was a nice medium size lunch which is exactly what I wanted. Both my clients had been there before and like the place as well. Next time I'm in the area, I'll go again."}
{"text":"I love heading to WCG for lunch, dinner or happy hour! Be sure to try the WCG steak salad for a meal, or the caprese for happy hour. If you sit in the bar area, make sure to ask for Swayze! She's the best bartender there is.  Also, the key lime pie martini is a must-try for those who like key lime pie. The martini is a perfect sweet-tart combination of lime & coconut, with a graham cracker rim! YUM!!"}
{"text":"I will say that I have had the best Ahi Poke Wonton Tacos ever here. I love the atmosphere and the food is great! Staff treated us great and would definitely recommend The White Chocolate Grill to anyone as their menu caters to the needs of anyone's tastes!"}
{"text":"Not impressed with anything , main dining room noisy ,  staff scrambled around like they were on their first day on the floor. Can't say I would return to see if I just hit a bad day. To close to other venues that have been consistently better"}
{"text":"Reminded me a lot of Houston's atmosphere. Had an ahi tuna salad (that I definitely recommend with dressing & sauce on the side), and a pinot noir.   Great food, good wine, ok service."}
{"text":"One of my favorites in Scottsdale.  Best whiskey selection I've ever seen.  If you're a bourbon fan this is a must visit!  Ribs and bread pudding are equally amazing!  I'll be back at least once a month!"}
{"text":"Pros - The food was great and prices in the $$-$$$ range. A good variety of foods as well; something for everyone. Our party had the AZ eggrolls, the chicken crepes, filet mignon cobb salad, the NY strip and the white ras. cheesecake. The salad was very large, easy to share with 2... the steaks were done as ordered, the chicken crepes I was told were so-so and the cheesecake was very rich and easy to share with 4.  The service was also very good; quick and kind server... came back to the table several times to check on us. Cons - The only con for us was the noise level. We sat near the semi-enclosed open kitchen area so we really had to talk loudly to hear each other from across the table. Noise seems to carry here just because of the large layout and high ceilings. I would certainly go back again... perhaps just request to be seated away from the kitchen area, especially if you are with any soft spoken people."}
{"text":"Been a longtime fan. Went for my birthday. I got the halibut SPECiAL and it wasn't - the chef overlooked it a lot.  Boyfriend got the prime rib, it was tough.  Bread was Thick and not warm.   My long time favorite is no more.  Thank goodness I had 50 dollar gift card or I would felt ripped off big time   Pass on this place folks."}
{"text":"We are visiting Scottsdale and went to the White Chocolate Grill because of the name and we were so surprised to find great food at moderate prices.  We ate outside which was wonderful because it wasn't noisy and the temp. was perfect."}
{"text":"I don't know if it was just this location, but I was totally underwhelmed. So was my friend. I was so excited to eat here. Everything was just blah. The drinks were so bad, we didn't finish them. One drink tasted like Nyquil. Their signature drink tasted like it was made with rubbing alcohol. I wish I had just gone to the cheesecake factory."}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite restaurants. I love the shrimp cocktail for the appetizer and filet mignon steak salad as an entree .  I've been here maybe 6 or 7 times and I still love coming back.  The ambiance is great, service is great, food is good, and the deserts are to die for. Prices are $$ to $$$ but I  don't mind paying for good food and good service.  They get kind of busy in the regular eating times, i try to go a little later to avoid the rush.  Highly recommended!  You won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"First time here and was not disappointed at all! Our server was wonderful! Very attentive and friendly! The manager, Lindsey, came over when our appetizer was taking too long and let us know it was on the house. As we continued speaking to her, she found out we were from out of town and bragged about how wonderful their desserts are. She let us know that they have the best cheesecakes, hands down!  And they are also known for their bread pudding. As we were contemplating which dessert we wanted Lindsey told us she'll bring us both desserts and they were on the house!  Talk about excellent customer service!  Next time I visit Phoenix, we will definitely return!  The food was wonderful as well!"}
{"text":"My family and I came here for dinner. All and all we had a good experience. It just wasn't 5 star worthy. For starters the attire is labeled as casual. We arrived in jeans, t-shirts, and baseball caps after a day of baseball (spring training). We all felt incredibly underdressed. We were seated in the bar area where it seemed all the underdressed people were being seated. Our service was excellent. Our drinks were always being refilled. Two of us ordered the blue cheese crusted filet and the BBQ trio. The blue cheese crusted filet came with mashed potatoes and your choice of a side. I chose the brussel sprouts. The brussel sprouts were cold and done in a salad form. It was amazing. The filet was so juicy and tasty. The mashed potatoes were good unfortunately we were only given a small smear of them on the plate. The BBQ trio was very tasty and a large portion of food. The price of the food seemed fair. Would definitely come back but in a different outfit."}
{"text":"We go here for our birthday dinners since it is expensive. I love their shrimp appetizer and my family loves their artichoke dip appetizer. I get their prime rib and fall in love with it every time. We really love the ambience of their outdoor patio seating, great for large groups. One of my sisters gets their jambalaya, another gets their citrus soy-glazed salmon and my mom gets their rotisserie chicken. For dessert we get their chocolate soufflé and love it!"}
{"text":"Ok, so 2nd visit was much more enjoyable. WCG knows red meat and knows what med. rare is. THX WCG, most establishments are scared to prepare beef that way.   I had the blue cheese crusted center filet, my Husband had the balsamic infused rib-eye. Both were terrific and the only item finished on the plate! I love the honey roated carrots, and the Israeli couscous has a nice, refreshing tang that I like. Thx WCG we will be back."}
{"text":"I love the Trout and order it almost every time. The service is great and the atmosphere is good but very loud. I would highly recommend this restaurant to my family and friends. A little on the pricey side $$$"}
{"text":"Our first time at The White Chocolate Grill. Great service, excellent ambiance, very good cheeseburger, and the apple pie with ice cream and caramel sauce was out of this world. We WILL be back!"}
{"text":"I love this place! The food is great and the White Chocolate Brownie is AMAZING! They also have a very extensive bourbon and whiskey selection if that is something that you like to drink."}
{"text":"For a chain restaurant, I am definitely impressed. The atmosphere is clean, cozy, and comfortable. It's a great place to catch up with friends and family or to watch a ball game at the bar. Everything on the menu is tasty. Be sure to check out their desserts such as the bread pudding and the brownie. I am a carnivorous meat lover. However I usually opt for the WCG salad with filet on top, and it satisfies my tummy and taste buds. Wait staff is usually friendly and attentive, yet some of the hostesses can act like they're too cool for school and be really annoying. Other than that, it's a great place."}
{"text":"Well, well, well. Not all is merry and cheerful in Scottsdale. Went to this establishment with some neighbors here for the winter. They were quite excited to go. I thought- \"hey! most of the places I have visited by there have been ok, so why not?\" Looked on Yelp and the menu seemed very good, so we were off... Friends made an 8:00 reservation... Had to wait 15 minutes to be seated. The hostesses were snobby!! Refused to look at you in the eye, and smile??? Not once. Got seated by a waiter because the hostesses all disappeared at once. He was nice, but seemed rushed. Obviously was more concerned about his own tables than us. Hey- I get it.. He got us water and actually changed the color of our napkins to ensure there would be no lint from the fabric showing on our clothes.... Uhmn ok? New one for me there.(and I have seen some interesting things) Our server arrived. This is a NOISY place, and we all had to strain to hear her voice over the din. We ordered drinks. My friends shared a bottle of wine, but two of the three glasses had to go back because they were dirty. I had a very good \"Dean \"Martini. Ordered the cheese artichoke dip. Meh. Not exciting. Typical. Ordered dinner.  One of my friends has an herb allergy and specifically told the server who wrote it down in big letters. She showed it to us. I ordered Prime Rib.  When our meal came, my sauces were not there, and my friends meal had the herb she asked NOT to have on it sprinkled liberally. Really??? Replaced and manager came and apologized Prime Rib was tough, but the Brussels sprouts salad was excellent. All my friends said their meals were ok. Not steller. We ordered dessert. They were out of what we requested and the one we ordered, the white chocolate brownie was so sweet, I could barely stand a spoonful.  They get two stars because they took my friends meal off the bill, but otherwise- nope. Not interested in going to a place to pay that much for attitude at the front, and carelessness in the back. This place needs work for what they charge. Maybe work on that instead of worrying about napkin lint."}
{"text":"We eat here at least once a week or take out! They have not only the Best food but the kindest employees always making sure your satisfied:) Excellent food friendly service you can't go wrong!! A+++ They always have a different side special which is awesome! The Brussel sprouts, or Beets are  always my Fav!!! The Turkey Ruben, French. Dip, and Ribs are AMAZING!!! Best Cesar in town! And Actually you can't go wrong with anything you order here! We love this place!"}
{"text":"I suppose it's good....for what it is: a generic, chain restaurant eerily similar to Houston's, or Hillstone, or whatever the hell generic shit it is.   It isn't that the food that I ordered was not good, but it wasn't very creative. It's all the same shit you get at Cheesecake Factory, or a steakhouse, or whatever. There wasn't much exciting about it. After a 30 minute wait to be seated, service was good. The clientele is a bit, um, on the older side. Again, it's a chain.... that's pretty much what you get.  We didn't order dessert and am now regretful, they looked absolutely fantastic!"}
{"text":"Stopped here for lunch and sat in the bar. The decor was interesting and loved the way the bottles in the bar were organized. We went because we heard the bourbon menu had some really good choices and it did not disappoint. The food was also very good, I had the filet mignon salad which was awesome. Service was excellent and the bartender was attentive and helpful."}
{"text":"Terrible, we bought hundreds of dollars worth of bourbon and the manager and waitress were arguing over a 15 dollar charge we said we didn't care about, yet they persisted. Really ruined our experience. Manager even insinuated we were lying, even after we stated to charge us whatever he wanted. Weird experience, would not recommend"}
{"text":"I made reservations here for my friends birthday. As soon as we got there we were seated immediately though the hostess wasn't too friendly. We ordered drinks and an the spinach and artichoke appetizer to share, which came out very quickly. All of the food was very good. The portions were large and everyone had food to take home. Since we were celebrating a birthday we had to order dessert. We got the blondie to share. It was super delicious! Overall I really enjoyed this restaurant, although the service could have been better. I would come back again."}
{"text":"Spent a few hours here this past Friday with some coworkers. I loved the ambiance...fireplace outside, soft amber glow in the interior.   My blackened whitefish sans bun was delish, the honey carrots tasted and felt more like yams?! The waiter helped me pair a fresh white wine that I seriously enjoyed...wish I could have had a few more glasses. The blondie brownie is huge...delicious and more like enough for 4.   I still am not sure I get the correlation of the name to the restaurant menu...maybe if they had chocolate fish or other odd creations like that...   Overall a pleasant experience, very pleasant."}
{"text":"The food was very good but what we appreciated was the experience. We came for my husband's Birthday dinner, just the two of us. We enjoyed an appetizer, salad, entree, and dessert complete with cocktails. Our server Sean did a wonderful job. We didn't feel rushed and had a great experience. My husband even said, \"tip him well, he did a great job\". What I noticed was that the wait staff were always helping each other. If one was walking by and noticed an empty plate, it was cleared even if it was not their table. Way to go. Thank you for the experience."}
{"text":"Don't get me wrong, White Chocolate Grill is good and definitely a place I will go back to, but there is something that just doesn't click. Everything tastes good and the service is fast and efficient but it is more of a relaxed dinner that a meal you get excited about. I can't say for everyone I really don't like waiting a half hour for a table. Call me impatient I don't care,  I really do not think many restaurants deserve that title even on a Friday night. I do love that they have an entire menu for gluten free diners. It's so hard to find gluten free in restaurants don't even mention an entire menu! I was impressed! I ended up splitting artichokes with parmesan (ask for no bread crumbs) with my mom and got myself a chicken caesar. Both were decent. We did end up ordering a gluten free chocolate soufflé (make sure to specify that you want it gluten free because they had a normal version as well) which was amazing and I would definitely go there just for that. Overall a good family weeknight restaurant that is that is above average meal. Definitely a place to go if you have celiacs or are gluten intolerant."}
{"text":"Great find! The food is consistently delicious. The service - wonderful.  Happy hour is super value for the $'s. The salads are amazing!"}
{"text":"I had a yummy White Chocolate Martini, but other than that, it was average.  Seems like plenty of people really like it because there were lots of people willing to wait."}
{"text":"Went here on Super Bowl Sunday. Great food! Stacked enchiladas very tasty. Salmon salad and Cobb salad were enjoyed by our guests. Service impeccable. Very clean restrooms. Meals averaged around $17a piece."}
{"text":"Phenomenal food as always. We had the trout and mashed potatoes, and they were cooked perfectly. The wine was delicious as well (get the Malbec!). Great ambience and service. We love the white chocolate grill and will be back anytime we want a nice dinner out!"}
{"text":"WCG came highly recommended from a friend who used to be a manager there. We made a rez for 8pm Saturday night and I'm glad we did...it was packed and a fair number of ppl were hanging outside. We had an absolutely fantastic meal from start to finish; the drinks were stiff; the kale salad was enough for three to share as a starter; the ribs and chicken were very tasty; our guests had the quinoa burger and soy glazed salmon, both received two thumbs up; and finally, the cheesecake and chocolate soufflé were the perfect amount of decadence. Special thanks to Ryan and Elizabeth for their excellent service. Overall, a great dinner with family on a Saturday night"}
{"text":"Me and my husband are visiting from CA and found this restaurant on yelp so we decided to try it for lunch. The food was DELICIOUS! I ordered the blackened fish sandwich with fries. The fish was great, it had a large portion on the sandwich and the fries were seriously soooo good (I love fries almost as much as I love sweets). My husband ordered the ribs and he said they were super tender, they fell right off the bone.  Of course we had to try desert, so we ordered the white chocolate brownie....to die for!!! It was so rich and the chocolate sauce and  ice cream on top made it even more delectable.   Everything was great and the service was wonderful. We are planning on coming back tomorrow for dinner!"}
{"text":"Enjoyed a nice dinner there on Sunday, to celebrate our anniversary!  I ordered my steak well done.  When it arrived it wasn't even close to that, but I didn't say a word, just went with it.  Our server noticed that my steak was not how I ordered it and asked if she could take it back to have them cook it longer.  I was trying to not be difficult, so I told them not to worry about it, it was fine.   The manager came over later and profusely apologized for the status is my steak send promptly comped my meal.    That's how the situation should be handled.  I will return.   Had they not gone above and beyond, I may not have felt the same way,  but I now feel that I will be assured a pleasant experience.  Well Done ;)"}
{"text":"Exceptional service, food, ambiance and pricing. There was a 35 minute wait at 5 o'clock on a Saturday but we found a spot up at the bar and it all worked out.  this place must be really good to have that kind of a wait that early on a Saturday night."}
{"text":"Went to WCG on Saturday with my family. My daughter eats anything, my son does not eat red meat and I don't eat any meat/flesh.  I was very disappointed to find the only thing that I could eat, other than a green salad, was a side of broccoli and a side of summer corn salad.  The veggie burger has walnuts which makes it hard for someone with nut allergies.  The House Special Tomato soup has bacon cooked in it and the couscous has pistachios on it.  Making it through the meal, we ordered dessert. We were again disappointed.  The Silky Chocolate Souffle' Cakes was neither silky nor souffle'.  It was more like a dense brownie cake.  The French White Chocolate Bread Pudding was burned on the bottom and I suppose the Fresh Apple Pie was good, my son at it all, but I couldn't taste it because it too had nuts in it.  Please, when making your menu, consider customers who may have allergies or desires to eat or not eat meat.  I will not be back to WCG unless some changes are made to their menu."}
{"text":"Love this restaurant. It never disappoints. Service always good & food delish! I ordered a salmon ceasar salad ($18). Lettuce tastes very fresh & a generous portion of salmon. I also ordered a side Brussels sprouts with almond. Very very good. I will recommend every one of my friends to dine here."}
{"text":"I love this restaurant. I order the same thing every time.  I wish I could try something different, but I miss my favorites when I am not here.  The Steak Cobb Salad, and the Chicken Salad are my favorite.  The bread pudding is fantastic, as well as the banana dessert, although I order it with a side of milk chocolate and puddle it all over.  Its time for another visit. :)"}
{"text":"Every single time I go here, I am always impressed....A+ on service, food, and ambiance!  Cocktails were made just perfect as well.  Can't wait til next time!"}
{"text":"hello from movie  mike we went there a months ago and had a great time the  waiter was wonderful  he pointed out some good things to eat and drink very helpful  check this place out for yourself"}
{"text":"Wonderful salads, great drink selection, and a dark romantic setting. The salad was so good that I ate it all! So I didn't have room for dessert. But I'll definitely go back soon for some! Great restaurant and highly recommended. Close to the theater too so it's perfect for a dinner And movie date night."}
{"text":"Nice atmosphere and great service.   I had the Parm crusted filet and it came out slightly over cooked.  The server agreed and immediately grabbed the plate to have them refire a new steak and let me know it would take a while and offered soup or salad while I waited.  The second steak was melt in your mouth amazing.   When something happens, taking care of it promptly and effectively is what service is about.  I would return to WCG and recommend it to others.  The server was also very helpful with recommendations for wine pairings as well.   Excellent dinner!"}
{"text":"Excellent food. Great service. Definitely recommend White Chocolate Grill. A bit pricey but well worth it."}
{"text":"I would give zero stars if I could.  My water remained empty the entire meal.  We were there to celebrate my wife's birthday and dessert is not free on birthdays.  Not a big deal, but Denny's has more class than this joint.  They have a \"vegan\" burger.....served on an egg bun.  Sharp thinking, genius chef!  Their $14 kale and spinach salad has only one vegan dressing- oil and vinegar.  Gross!  The people I was with said their food wasn't that great, either.  My wife had a field greens salad and currently can't drink enough water because something was spicy and she has an awful taste in her mouth.  Their $8 \"birthday\" bread pudding (thanks for the free candle, cheapskates) \"sucked\" according to everyone who tried it.  Awful, awful, awful.  Never again.  I hope this place is boarded up and replaced with ANYTHING- even a Chili's, Applebees, or Sizzler would be higher end than this noisy dump."}
{"text":"Always delicious, fresh and fun. I tried the hot chocolate this time and it was amazing!"}
{"text":"Abject disappointment is what best describes the whole of this experience, beginning with a Friday night happy only lasting until 5:30. Imagine that.  I'd happily slogged down on beer when last call cast its gloomy shadow.  [Quick, another beer and some appetizers before the cutoff. \"WAITER!\"]  Me:  Uh, I'll have another 8th St and an order of the         happy hour chips and guacamole.  Waiter: speaking uncannily like Bill Lumbergh from Office Space:       \"Yeahhhh, nooooo, the guac isn't part of the happy hour menu         anymore.         It's a side order for $9.99\".  Me: (looking perplexed, thinking, what the fuck?)  \"WHAT THE FUCK?\" (nice inflection on the         fuck)         Waiter: Yeahhhh, sorrrry  Me:  Alright, bring another beer and I'll have my order ready when you get back  Beer arrives - time is 5:30.  Waiter: Are you ready to order?  DM:  Yep. Eleven more beers, the happy hour ribs, the happy hour shrimp, and           the happy hour Arizona egg rolls.           And get my wife seven pomegranate martinis, an order of ribs, a water, three           glasse of ice and about thirty napkins.  Wife: Have you lost your fucking mind? Two hours from now you'll be          sawing logs on the family room floor and I'll be watching Dateline - again -         by myself.          WE'RE LEAVING, NOW!  Me:   [sore from impromptu neutering]   Yeah - just bring the check   Our beloved White Chocolate Grill has, like so many other restaurants of its ilk succumbed to cheaping-out on happy hour; overcharging for popular menu items, and featuring surly waiters. If this was 1920's Alabama, I'd  have shot him, thrown him in my pit barbecue and feed him to local law enforcement officials at their annual picnic.  White Chocolate: I've been patiently waiting for this joyous time of year when snowbirds flock to their cool summer abodes -  just like rats jumping off a sinking freighter.  This is when I come knocking, so I can have you all to myself.  And you pull this shit?  DISCLAIMER  1.) I'd just finished watching Office Space before heading out for happy hour.       Bill Lundbergh was everywhere.  2.) I wouldn't really shoot anyone like the girl in Fried Green Tomatoes. I would      however give them a savage tongue lashing. (not the Michael Douglas variety)  3.) My balls are detachable in situations such as this - neutering isn only temporary  4.) I wish I'd taken the Rodeo Clown career path.       Being gored a few hundred times would  beat this life I'm living.  5.) Mrrrrrrr."}
{"text":"Has to be one of my favorite places to eat.  I have never had a bad meal or experience, and I have been many many times. Prime rib has to be my fav."}
{"text":"I enjoyed the prime rib, and I thought it was reasonably priced. We sat in the bar which was noisy, but we still got good service from the waitress. The trout and cous cous was also very good. We split the banana cream pie for desert and it was so fresh with real banana's. Would definitely go back."}
{"text":"I take business clients to White Chocolate about once or twice a week. Unfortunately, the restaurant has deteriorated so badly that I will no longer patronize it. My last visit was a disaster. The hostesses did not greet us and a sullen, taciturn host grabbed the menus and wandered to a table without inviting us to follow him. He then came back and wanted to know why we had not followed him. The kitchen has become a disaster: all 3 of us left food. The veggie burger was burnt, my ahi tuna salad lacked avocado, and my 3rd guest complained that her chicken salad was overly drenched in dressing. The only bright spot was our helpful server, Marty, who comped us the burnt burger."}
{"text":"On our anniversary night we finally made our way out to Scottsdale just to give this place a try.   For an appetizer, we had the grilled artichoke with aioli sauce (which was recommended by the waitress, supposedly it's one of their popular appetizers). we've never tried a full artichoke before, but it was actually good..you could smell and taste the wood grill in the artichoke and it was even better with the aioli sauce. Just wish there was more to eat because towards the middle it was mainly just the leaves so there was not much to eat.   For dinner we had the Rotisserie chicken crepes with mashed potatoes topped with mushrooms!! lots of mushrooms!! and their signature gravy. This was truly amazing! Their gravy had such great flavoring that it made everything just taste so good!  (we couldn't finish it so we took it to go, heated it up the next day and it was still THAT good!)   We also had their Balsamic Ribeye with Israeli couscous. They could of used a bit more balsamic for their ribeye just to add a bit more flavor to it, but overall it was good, not bad.   and last but not least the white chocolate banana cream pie for dessert!!!!!!!!! I was mainly excited for this particular dessert and it was soooo yummy!!!! One of our favorite! and we wanted to order more and more and moreeeeeee! we would drive 45 min. just to go eat more of that banana cream pie!"}
{"text":"Stopped here for an early dinner. Amazing customer service and food too!  I ordered the filet Cobb salad. Super yummy. And, yep, I had dessert--their bread pudding. It should be illegal. Taking most of it home. They packed a to go box that will set me back 600-2000 calories. Don't miss going to this place. It's one of the best restaurants in the are."}
{"text":"I came back here with my boyfriend recently and I truly think it's worth the five stars so I figured an update was due! The food is exceptional, I'm not a vegetarian but I ordered the veggie burger (not sure on the actual name) and was blown away! P.S. if you go this route, get the Israeli couscous on the side. The service is so friendly and it feels like you're talking with a friend - I think ours was Shawn? Sean? I could be wrong on the name but regardless he was a great server.   I'll definitely be coming back. It's a little pricey but you get what you pay for. :)"}
{"text":"A client of mine gave me a $100 gift card and I've gone in for lunch twice in the last month.  I've had the French dip and the Southwest Chicken salad....yum on both!!"}
{"text":"They do a pretty good Houston's impersonation. Highlight is the roasted chicken."}
{"text":"My husband and I enjoy coming to WCG when we're in Phoenix however, this may be our last visit. We were in town over the long Memorial Day weekend on our way to the resort we stopped for lunch. I had the Flirtini which was good, we ordered the rib eye sandwich and the dip duo and it was all good. Our waitress was sweet, she had a great personality and took really good care of us.   We decide to have dinner there on our last night in town, the shrimp cocktail was not cleaned properly and I proceeded to clean the shrimp myself and make a \"poop pile\" on the appetizer plate.  When our waiter (he had NO personality) came by my husband told him to let the chef know that this is unacceptable. He seemed unfazed so I interjected and said \"I love to cook and I would never serve that to a guest\" he mumbled something then walked off with the plate. We ordered the prime rib but they sold out. Okay, no problem bring us the rib/chicken platter with mashed potatoes. The chicken was dry and really had no flavor, the ribs were decent nothing to write home about.   Our waiter comes back to check on us then leaves a dessert menu on the table when we just started to eat our dinner.  This is my husband's biggest pet peeve, if you ask my husband if he is interested in dessert and he has a plate full of food in front of him your tip just went down. If you ask him if he'd like a coffee or cappuccino when his glass is full of wine, your tip just went down.  Our waiter never came back, we had to ask someone else for our bill. The shrimp cocktail was not taken off of our bill nor was any apology from the manager or chef, no dessert was offered for having to clean the poop shoot of each and every shrimp we ate.   Long story short, my husband left 0 tip and wrote the waiter a note saying the shrimp cocktail was $13 that would have been your tip but you didn't take the shrimp off of our bill, customers don't want to eat sh*t and shouldn't have to clean their own shrimp because the cook staff is too lazy."}
{"text":"I didn't realize this was a chain (I don't have them near me) and I don't generally rave about chains (as others have said) but this was really good.  We had drinks, appetizers, dinner and desserts (it was a work event) and all were very good.  We sat outside on the patio - it was a Wednesday night and the place was packed.  The service was a little on the slow side (for drinks) but not horrible considering we were a big party and it was really busy.  The deserts were TDF - so save room for those!  I had a steak, others had fish and everything was the right sized portions (not too big and not too small) so that we could enjoy appetizers shared and still have dessert as well :)  I will definitely be back"}
{"text":"This place drew me in because of the name - I love white chocolate and the majority of their desserts are made with this decadence. It reminded me a little bit of Cheesecake Factory, just with a bigger bar and no slippery floors. A lot of the reviews said that wait times were bad, even with a reservation; but we didn't have a problem and were seated at the exact time of our reservation.   The food is just ok, and I think overpriced for the portions. There was nothing overly outstanding about our meal except for the service, which was attentive and fast. We started with the artichoke dip, which was salty but decent; however the chips they served with it were thin and greasy. It didn't compliment the dip at all and we left most of it untouched. We ordered the scallops and Alaskan halibut, both dishes were cooked and flavored well. The side dishes were a bit of a problem though. Our green beans were under cooked and had little flavor and the brussel sprouts were just as lack luster.   Overall, underwhelming for the price but great service and decent entrees."}
{"text":"Took my girlfriend here for her birthday. Staff was very nice and attentive, even though they were slammed.  Both of our meals were top notch.  If you are looking for a classy, higher end place to go for a special occasion, White Chocolate Grill is a solid choice."}
{"text":"We had our weekly family dinner here last weekend and had the pleasure of being waited on by Swayze. As another reviewer mentioned, she treated us like Royalty as well. My parents are old and crabby but that never threw her off her game and she rolled with the punches. She kept my wine glass full and the food came quickly so I could make a fast exit.   Thanks Swayze for making family dinner a little less painful."}
{"text":"The atmosphere was nice, but the food was not good. I ordered the spinach dip and the chips came out stale twice, I ordered rotisserie chicken and the mash potatoes came out cold, and the chicken was over cooked. The waitress was not helpful and in attentive."}
{"text":"I used to go to this place when it first opened - something has changed.   It used to have a upscale feel, without a minimal menu, and mediocre food -- USED TO.  It used to have a friendly wait staff, that explained the menu items of question, and filled empty drinks in a timely manner - USED TO.  It used to be a good place to take the family, know we were going to have a nice meal, and have a good time - USED TO.  It USED TO be one of my favorite places to go, sadly no more."}
{"text":"The White Chocolate Grill is a great place to dine! I've gone twice now. Once for lunch and the other for an early dinner. The hostess staff on my lunch visit were very attentive and helpful. All servers in our section helped to either bus the table, refill water, or ask if there was anything they could do.  We had the AZ Egg Rolls for an appetizer and they were delicious. The jalapeño sauce is fantastic - definitely get some to have on the side. I had the salmon which was cooked perfectly and the mashed potatoes. My boyfriend had the Cajun chicken sandwich, also phenomenal. The sauce that came with that (almost like a spicy ranch) was also a nice touch. For dessert we had the White Chocolate Brownie! Delicious!!  My most recent visit, I was helped by the bartender who made a suggestion for the ahi tuna. Maybe some of the best ahi tuna I've ever had.   Overall, great experience and I look forward to going back!"}
{"text":"I visited this restaurant during the summer with a party of 8.  We were a large group so we opted for patio seating. The restaurant was packed on a busy work day week. The bar was overflowing with people.  The restaurant is casual but dimly lit so it gives it that intimate feel.  As our large party made it from the bar to the patio, our drink orders were promptly taken.  I decided to go with white wine since I had my eye on the Stacked Chicken Enchiladas. Oh boy was I happy with the decision, these were the one of the best enchiladas I have ever had. The food tasted fresh. The atmosphere was quite lively....give it a chance!"}
{"text":"Bobby runs a great operation. Other than the enchiladas, I have never had a meal that I didn't like."}
{"text":"I got the rotisserie chicken crepes. It was delicious, as was the broccoli I had for a side. It was a large portion. My fiancé got the jambalaya. It was spicy and delicious. It was very low on shrimp and sausage, so it was basically rice. The pricing was a bit high. Overall it was an enjoyable evening, I might go one day."}
{"text":"This place was a great value for happy hour food deals as portions are big.  On my last visit thou the chicken strips seemed different as far as taste and meat was stringy.  Won't be going back for sometime"}
{"text":"One of my favorite restaurants by far!!! They have an awesome gluten free menu and a gluten free desert that is to die for!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! The restaurant itself is beautiful and the bar area is so unique. You just can't take your eyes off of it. The way they have the bottles organized on the wall with the lighting is awesome and an art piece in itself. The service there is always top notch which is a plus for me. Its probably a good thing that I don't live closer because I would be in there everyday. lol Love this place."}
{"text":"Dinner for four.  Had reservations and did not get table asked for. Tortilla soûp..not so great. The Cobb salad with beef tenderloin.....salad good, but tenderloin was stringy trim pieces, it appeared. Pretty disappointed.  Noisy as usual.  Not much that can be done about that.  Love the way the restaurant is decorated.  Not sure we'll be back.  Disappointing."}
{"text":"It took me almost a year to come back after a poor dining experience.  However, I tried it again and really enjoyed myself.  The service was very good, the salmon was prepared to perfection.  The other meals at the table: the jambalya, the French dip were equally prepared well.  All in all, a very nice meal.  Would consider returning if I was in the area."}
{"text":"Let me start out by saying that this place is amazing! I've never had a problem with the service or the food myself, so if it were just based on what my experiences were with WCG, it'd get five stars. Unfortunately, and this is a rare occasion, take out orders get a little messed up. Once, they forgot a complete order. They did offer to correct it, and they did, for free. Its nice when a place will say they screwed up.  Now on to good! The Spinach Artichoke dip is sooooo tasty! I always get it when I go. The tortilla soup is amazing. The caesar salad is ok, the dressing isn't my favorite, but it's not bad. The rustic club is THE sandwich to get (unless you like french dip..... then that's THE sandwich to get....)  I have yet to try dessert, I always get too full from my meal to try it, but they look very tasty!"}
{"text":"My wife and I came in here with our (surprisingly well behaved!) twenty-month old daughter for a weekday dinner... I told her, I know you're going to judge me for taking you to \"The White Chocolate Grill\", but just ignore the name and enjoy it for what it *IS*!  And it was incredible!  The servers were so nice to our daughter, offering to bring her kids food out first, giving her lots of attention, and giving us a great booth so we could trap her in! :)  As for our meals, we loved the local beers on tap, my wife loved her veggie burger (she loves it when restaurants make the time to create their own veggie burger patties), and I loved my BBQ 3-way combo plate.  Somehow I needed a bunch of meat that night, and TWCG delivered in a BIG way.  And my wife wouldn't stop talking about how great everything was... so that was good!  I think we were just in the exact right mood + temperament + appetite to enjoy this place for what it is, and it was definitely one of our favorite dining experiences in quite some time!"}
{"text":"Absolutely love this place! The bartenders are great! They are very knowledgeable. They have a great happy hour with both food and drink. Classy atmosphere. I do have two complaints. The lighting in the bar and the A/C. Please turn down the lights a little. I feel like I'm being interrogated. Also, cool the bar to a comfortable temperature."}
{"text":"When visiting the Scottsdale area, I had the opportunity to eat at The While Chocolate Grill, an honest American dining experience, two times.  The salads are amazing, the service was excellent and I couldn't wait to go back for the filet mignon cob salad.   We were wondering why everyone doesn't get a little piece of white chocolate with the bill......"}
{"text":"We love coming here. This visit had a bit of an issue with the preparation of the food for the first time, which happens, no big deal. But our server and, I'm assuming, manager Lindsay we're very professional and handled everything beautifully.  Thank you."}
{"text":"I was visiting Scottsdale and wanted to try someplace new.  I noticed that the White Chocolate Grill was nearby and had wonderful reviews so we decided to check it out.  What a wonderful surprise!  The decor is cozy and chic.  The outdoor entryway patio has a very inviting fire pit around which people were sharing bottles of wine.  We each had the pyramid hefeweisen and the chips and guacamole, which were very good.  The waiter noticed that we ran low on chips and brought us more without us having to ask. I the seared ahi tuna appetizer as my entree.  It was perfectly cooked, and the portion was so large it was definitely enough for an entree.  My dining partner had the balsalmic ribeye with the Israeli couscous, which was fantastic.  For dessert we had the chocolate souffle cake which, like all chocolate souffle cakes, was delicious.  I would definitely recommend trying this place out."}
{"text":"I've been coming to WCG for years, and it's always a reliable choice for lunch or dinner.  Their Famous Chicken salad (sans chicken, as I'm a vegetarian) is wonderful... Creamy goat cheese, crunchy almonds, sweet golden raisins and flavorful crotons in a tangy and warm curry dressing... I dream about this salad when I'm in NY and CA.  Also, upon my last visit to the WCG, I discovered a veggie burger on their lunch menu!  It was one of the best veggie burgers I've ever had; it had an excellent texture and consistency and the flavor profile was complex.  IMHO, the fries were too salty, so next time I'll choose a different side.  Also, another slight shortcoming was the dessert I ordered.  I had the banana cream pie and I was underwhelmed.  When eaten with the caramel sauce, it was a delicious, perfectly sweet dessert, but if you had to take a bite without the caramel sauce (which was often necessary due to the small amount of caramel provided), it wasn't sweet enough and also lacked an in depth flavor profile.  Something else to note about the WCG is that it's an excellent restaurant in the area for take-out!  I've ordered take-out from the WCG on numerous occasions, and the food is always hot, fresh, and delicious, and usually comes with plenty of rolls and deliciously addictive butter.  I would recommend the WCG for locals, and travelers, as it's right off the 101 for a convenient stop while traveling."}
{"text":"Took hubby here for his birthday-we have been in this area for two years and have never gone. I am a superfan after one visit! Great food-seriously, really great food. Great service and a nice atmosphere. We will be back very soon. Don't forget to have the white chocolate cheesecake for desert-one piece, two forks and a real espresso and a perfect end to the meal. I had the filet mignon salad and hubby had the salmon-shared a caprese salad to start. It was all just perfect. GO!"}
{"text":"This is the second time we have been to WCG and we had another good meal and great experience!  The service was good and so was the food! Keep up the good work!"}
{"text":"Went there for my baby's birthday for the first time and it was amazing! We had the double dip app(8.99) which was so tasty! The chips were thin and not oily at all, the guacamole was awesome and the cheese was yummy even if it was a bit spicy! My baby ordered the balsamic ribeye( 27.89) with broccoli as her side. The ribeye, huge tomatoes and the mashed potatoes were awesome! The broccoli on the other hand was soooo salty!! It was more like a side of salt with some broccoli. I ordered the kale salad ( 13.99) and it was huge but tasted so good! It wasn't too much dressing and the chicken that was mixed in the salad was delicious! We will have to go back to try desserts because we couldn't eat anymore after all this yummy food!"}
{"text":"Very cool restaurant with great service. Happy hour is a bit pricey, but good food. I had the southern chicken salad which was great. They serve salad exactly how I would love it everytime, a cold big bowl, and already chopped and mixed. They gave  a generous amount of chicken and good amount of dressing. Dessert was good, but I like very warm bread pudding and it was just slightly warm. Mojito's are strong, but missing the flavors of the mint which is a reason why I ordered it. Good place, will definitely be back."}
{"text":"I'd give another star if I could.   Spencer waited on us and the service was amazing. We came in for the bread pudding that is beyond delicious and ended up with banana cream pie too!! Both were some of the best I've had anywhere!!"}
{"text":"Returned for our anniversary dinner, we have been here multiple times and always Had good experiences. This time however, food was horrible and would expect much better quality from WCG. Fish was very tough, steak was a bad cut, very thin and dry. I tried to contact the management to give them feedback on our visit and never got a response from them. We will not be returning and will have to go somewhere else to make up for our anniversary dinner."}
{"text":"Wooooooooooooooow. The employees of this place are masters at being terrible to customers. I get a message thru Yelp from an Amber apologizing and saying they addressed the matter with their employee and would like to replace the experience. I was not interested in free food because that wasnt the point of my previous review, but I appreciated that they addressed the matter with the employee, so I was willing to give them a second chance.  I went in and said that an Amber said she was going to cover my meal. IMMEDIATELY the employees demeanor changed towards me like a palace guard guarding the gates. AGAIN I was treated by employees like I did not matter and was asked to move to the side for their paying customers WHICH IS EXACTLY WHY I DIDNT WANT THE FREE MEAL IN THE FIRST PLACE!!!  Even AFTER SPEAKING TO THE MANAGER I was told they were not going to replace the meal. Wow. UN BELIEVABLE EXPERIENCE. This place can go fuck themselves. DONE WASTING MY TIME WITH THIS DUMP.  Seriously! Did they just invite me back to remind me they all suck?! Why?!"}
{"text":"Food was great. Service started out good. We were left midway through our entrees and they sat in front of us for a good while before server came back. I said in the reso it was my bf's birthday. NOTHING was done. Experience was fabulous but ruined by how the meal ended. Disappointed."}
{"text":"This is by far my favorite restaurant in town.  Steak sandwich is out of this world.  It has a 5 star feel for a 4 star price.  Great place for an intimate date, happy hour or celebrating with fam."}
{"text":"My husband and I went to eat before a memorial service., We were seated quickly on the outdoor heated patio because it was a 20 min wait. Which was fine. We ordered the spinach artichoke dip that was very good. It stopped there, we waited until our meal was,served for water refills and our entrees were not good. I had the filet cobb salad, it was soggy and my filet was cold. My husband had the chicken and spinach crepes that were over covered with mushrooms. You tasted nothing but over powering mushrooms. We don't live close so we will not be back."}
{"text":"The drinks were amazing, but the food wasn't all that great. My friend ordered a Caesar salad and said she has had better. As a vegetarian, I didn't have much options, so I ended up getting a bunch of sides. A fly fell in my drink and they replaced it for free. The service was good."}
{"text":"This is one of my fiancee's favorite restaurant in the valley.  We have been here several times now.  He really wanted me to give it five stars but I think its more four stars for now.  I may edit later.       I Treated my fiancee's family here on a very busy friday night.  We had reservations for six at six.  We arrived 15 mins late, so we had to wait about 20 mins for seating.  Wasn't  bad considering the place was PACKED.       Our food came pretty quickly.  My fiancee loved his parmesan crusted filet.  My fish special was really good. Slightly overdone, but still very good.  Everyone else liked their choices as well.  one of them was the baby backed ribs that apparently fell off the bone, it was so tender.  I didn't try it but everyone else told me.      Dessert was so YUMMY. Banana cream pie mmmmmm. My fiancee loved the apple pie.      Overall, i have to give this place four stars.  Atmosphere  was fun, it is a little dark but i loved it.   Our food was timed perfectly.  Portions were great, not small but not big either.  Our server was great.  I think the price for food was very very reasonable .  I do not consider the place pricey but more moderate.  Pricey to me is Mastro's or Roys ( Those are my faves).    I never had happy hour here but it looks fun."}
{"text":"I cannot gush enough about this place. I have told so many people about it already, that I had to write a review. The food was DELICIOUS!! When you don't have to use the salt and pepper shakers at a meal, you know it's good! We started off with the AZ spring rolls, they were perfectly crunchy on the outside and served with yummy side sauce choices ( I told the waiter I could of ate 20 more)!  For the entree I had the Crab Cakes and Garlic Filet Mignon, served with  mashed potatoes and their  \"good gravy\". The tarter sauce on the Crab Cakes was home made and was perfect, I could of licked that sauce bowl. The \"good gravy\" was really f'ing good! It wasn't a traditional brown gravy but more of a clear color. I am a mashed potatoe whore so I know good potatoes and these were killer! I didn't need to use any kind of sauce for my crab cakes or filet, they were good just the way they came, filled with flavor. I also ordered a Long Island that was one of the best I've ever had, later the waiter told me the sweet and sour was home made too! Being so impressed with everything, we decided to do two desserts. We had the white chocolate brownie and the bread pudding. Both rich and tasty. The waiter warned me that  I might not be able to finish both desserts ( boy, he didn't know who he was talking to!) I finished all my plates and dessert!  I was so incredibly happy with this place. I have seriously not been this impressed with everything (from service to food to drinks) in who knows how long. I guess I'm spoiled with the chef I work with,  I have high expectations on food!   Go try this place, it's SO worth it. And if you get Anthony he rocks! He knew the menu like the back of his hand, which was so helpful for my friend who has allergies.    I plan to go there and just move down the menu, it's my new favorite spot in Scottsdale!"}
{"text":"This was a first visit for us. Good thing we had reservations because  it was very busy. Our server was superbly pleasant and cracked jokes with us every time she stopped at our table. The atmosphere is a little confusing to me. It seems like a higher end establishment but then it's full of overly casually dressed patrons. It also felt like the kind of place people go to eat quickly and then leave...as of 9pm, the place emptied out. But the food....would have been much better had the A.C. vent right over our table not blasted the food cold. The air temperature was so cold, we had to go to my truck and get a blanket to wrap on our bodies. Maybe that's why I don't really remember the food because all we could think about was shovelling in our food and getting out of there."}
{"text":"This review is only based on their bread pudding dessert! Top 5 on my dessert list hands down! Make sure to make it a la mode with a scoop of their vanilla ice cream-the only way to do it. Other than that, I've never actually had their food here but it looks like a nice open restaurant to have dinner at. It has always been pretty busy every time I've been here too so try making a reservation when coming here, and make sure to get the bread pudding. Even if your full."}
{"text":"It's hit or miss here.   The Tomato Gin soup is \"off the chain\"....but the gravy on the rotisserie chicken crepe will have you running to find the nearest outhouse.  The desserts are blah.    You would think being named the \"White chocolate Grill\" you would have some awesome desserts.  No, they are simply \"okay\".  Nothing to write home to mom about.   On the other hand, the service is awesome  and there is no pretentious behavior from waitstaff.... in spite of the location."}
{"text":"Some of the best gumbo I've had.  Very quick service both times I've been there.  Beautiful dinning area aside a gorgeous bar/ lounge.  The grill offers some delicious steaks and smoked fish. The samon and bbq are my favorite.    Highly recommended :)"}
{"text":"The staff was friendly and attentive.  The filet was probably one of the best I have had since moving to Phoenix.  Highly recommended,"}
{"text":"Have had many lunches at the White chocolate Grill. Everything has been spectacular. I normally gravitate towards the prime rib French dip. But have also had the fillet mignon cobb salad, the Cajun chicken sandwich and the Ahi tuna appetizer. All terrific. Today I tried the Maytag cheeseburger and it did not disappoint whatsoever. Also their fries were delicious as usual. Highly recommend the WCG. Friends favorite dinner is also outstanding."}
{"text":"I do not understand when you ask for well done meet the chef burns the meet is a rule in USA   Pros: nice and clean  Cons: food Is mediocre nothing came as we ask  Meet came burned, hamburger came with cheese waiters stop in our table at least 5 times asking how was everything   Very loud please  Another sport bar  Not recommend"}
{"text":"Stumbled upon this amazing spot on my recent business trip - Everything about it was exceptional. The ambiance is very cool, almost swanky. The highly attentive and well trained staff look like they were hand picked from a J.Crew catalog.  Bar area is stadium seating with cool high ceilings, and comfortable plush  leather seats.  Even the bathrooms were minimalist class in stone grey w/recessed candle cubbies.   Food is as amazing as the ambiance - Cajun Chicken sandwich was one of the best I've had. Reportedly good burgers with melted in to patty cheese and salads. It was so good on my last day and given there are many other eateries to try in the area I was drawn back to the same place to see if they could repeat the performance.    They did and it was actually even better - amazing team service - awesome steak and turkey sandwich and some unidentifiably delicious mashed potatoes and mystery gravy.   Really impressive - I will be back"}
{"text":"Food and service both deserve this rating as does the other location outside of Chicago."}
{"text":"We stopped here for a late night snack. I was looking for something light. I decided to try the artichoke appetizer since full artichokes were not normally available in the area where I live. The artichoke was good and something different. Consuming an artichoke takes some work. The rest of my party seemed to enjoy their meals."}
{"text":"Overall, this was a good choice for a birthday dinner with my family!  In the distant past, I had visited this restaurant and found the service to be slow. I was reluctant to try it again however, with two munchkins under 8, options are limited. I can only visit Chili's or Red Robin so many times.   Yes, it's décor is very Houstons-like and WCG reeks of its opening days when trendy hotties and desperate men with money would troll and try out the cocktails and food. Now, everyone is a little older and guess what they have now?! A CHILDREN'S MENU AND CRAYONS! If I was childless, I would lament the decline of Western Civilization. However, I was happy. And the kids were happy. And I had an awesome white chocolate martini and the mahi. My husband was content with his steak. My children devoured the white brownie desert. (So much for my birthday treat. ) I do have one complaint. The white pasta on the children's menu is just that, simply pasta and butter. The kids hated it, and instead shared a yummy cheeseburger.  Give it a try again, even if you have kids."}
{"text":"We love going to this place for dinner, or just to get a drink at the bar.  The food is very good.  The BBQ ribs fall off the bone.  Nice ambience inside, and outside on the patio. Nice place for date night, or to celebrate a special occasion. Great service too!"}
{"text":"The White Chocolate Grill is a nice restaurant with a good sized menu. Some things are super expensive but its nice because there's a range, not everything is crazy pricey! So I had not been here in many years but I went back for lunch today.  I love a good house-made veggie burger and was happy to see this option on the menu. Was also happy to see all of the different sides to choose from. I went the unhealthy route and got fries though haha. The veggie burger sounded really delicious, with brown rice, quinoa, walnuts, all the things I like in a veggie burger! Unfortunately I do not think I read close enough and there was pickles on it. I like pickles in general but hate them on sandwiches for some reason, and felt like the taste was still there when I took them off so that was a tad disappointing, but my own fault haha. Also the bun was a bit soggy on the bottom and there was too much spicy mayo (which was not spicy). The patty itself was very good though and the sesame bun was yummy, the other veggies on there were tasty! I think if I go back I'd just have to ask for no pickles and no mayo then I'd be happy. It was still expensive for a veggie burger though, I've had cheaper ones that are much better, but I did like it. I tried the broccoli too and enjoyed it! Our server was very nice and chatty, and the atmosphere there is awesome. Overall, not my number one fave restaurant, but not too shabby!"}
{"text":"Everyone's side dishes were cold and main dishes were REALLY SKIMPY. I ordered a Mojito and couldn't taste any rum in it. The waitress forgot to bring my daughter her soda, then when she finally did bring it, it tasted watered down and flat. You would think that when restaurants charge $3 for a soda, it should at least be good. The waitress was not surprised the soda was bad; like she expected it to be. All of our carrots were cold and we told the waitress, so she brought us ONE order of hot carrots for the FOUR of us to share. My daughter ordered the center cut and it was TINY. Waitress said that it came on a BED of mashed potatoes; one should hardly call a TEASPOON a \"bed\". She had to turn over the meat and the bloody mashed potatoes were stuck hidden under there. My daughter complained so the waitress brought over a whole Tablespoon and a Half of mashed potatoes. When they first brought out the food our younger son remarked how STUPID all the dishes looked except for the ribs (which I think are now about $26. Up for just under $20. Last year) because there was WAY more EMPTY space on the plate than food. This place has downsized their portions incredibly but are too cheap to buy new smaller plates. No one had leftovers except for the cold carrots we took to go. I can't understand how restaurants think it's ok to jack up their prices to $30 per dish and cut back so much on the portions. Everybody is still hungry, so I have to cook now! Ever since the restaurant rescue shows are on tv, it seems like all the restaurants think it's acceptable to have a 10% food cost with a 90% profit. My son loved his ribs though."}
{"text":"Finally, a great all around dinner.  I ordered the NY Strip which was prepared perfectly.  The server was excellent.  Gave great menu descriptions of flavors and suggested sides and wine with our meal.  My wife had the grilled salmon which had a great light flavor.  Next time we make the reservations we will request for the same server he really made the experience wonderful. The best part was that the entire restaurant was packed and the kitchen made it seamless.  Awesome fresh food and above and beyond service."}
{"text":"The food was great and the service  even better for a very busy Saturday night crowd.  I wanted to take this opportunity to personally thank Montana who went out of her way to get my son some bread and a glass of water after telling her that he had an upset stomach.  She even came outside to check on him as we were waiting for our table, to see if he needed anything else.  This is what I call great customer service.  My son and I are very appreciative of you,  Montana.  Thank you for going the extra mile and helping my son during his time of need."}
{"text":"White Chocolate Grill = Heaven's Waiting Room  There are more old people crammed in here than the dining hall in a Geezer Ghetto on Bingo night.  Food is PRICEY and bland.  Think of a Piccidilly or Wyatt's or Luby's cafeteria with nice decor and table side service.  I will say this - they do a fantastic job at what they do.  It just isn't my cup of tea.  If you like OLD and BORING, you might give this place a solid 4 stars.  Just not my scene."}
{"text":"I only went here once, I don't recall what I ate for dinner but I will never forget the chocolate desserts. So yummy!"}
{"text":"This place is rapidly becoming one of our go-to spots.  My wife loves the ribs, and I am a big fan of the chicken sandwich.   Also a great place for for a salad at lunch or dinner.  It is always jammed, but the service is spot on, and we have not had a meal there that we didn't like.  But better make a reservation."}
{"text":"What a dinner.  I picked this place because it was very close to my house, and the reviews on Yelp were relatively good. I am only disappointed that I didn't try it sooner. The wait staff, hostesses, runners and bartenders were friendly, courteous and quick to smile; everybody seemed genuinely eager and happy to take care of the guest's needs. The ambiance is trendy casual without crossing the line to pretentious. The lighting is warm and inviting but low enough to still provide an intimate feel, and the dark woods used throughout the restaurant help lend a subtle sophistication to the atmosphere.  The menu is quite large and can be almost overwhelming, with entrees ranging from salads and sandwiches to burgers and steaks. My date and I decided to start out with an appetizer and, although the guacamole and chilled cheese with chip special sounded good, opted for their shrimp cocktail.  The shrimp were perfectly cooked and served with a cocktail sauce and a mayonnaise-based jalapeño sauce. The cocktail sauce was really horseradish heavy, which we both loved, and really tangy. The mayo sauce seemed odd, as I thought it was tartar sauce, but turned out to be a very good, subtle accompaniment to the shrimp. It was so good, in fact, we were dipping our forks into it and taking bites of the lettuce garnish from the plate. The staff also added an extra shrimp (the menu said seven were served) because there were two of us sharing.  For dinner I chose the bleu cheese crusted tenderloin, rare, with broccoli as a side. The steak was cooked right on the border of bleu, which is how I think a rare steak should be served. The bleu cheese was slightly melted over the top of the steak, forming a cap, and then either brûléed or browned under a salamander. The meat was tender, moist, well seared, and more flavorful than most tenderloins I've had. The broccoli was also very well cooked, sitting in that zone right between crunchy and soft, and very well seasoned.  My date had the Ono in a light citrus bur blanc and honeyed carrots. The fish was wood grilled perfectly and the sauce added a bit of needed fat and acid without overpowering the subtle flavor of the fish. The honeyed carrots... Wow; the carrots were fantastic.  For dessert, two caramel lattes and the gluten free chocolate soufflé cake. The coffees were stellar, and the texture of the cake had me doubting it was gluten free. The chocolate was extremely rich, still warm, and the cool creme anglaise was a delicious counterpoint to the dark, earthy chocolate.  I've had dinners half as good at three times the price. An impressive first outing to the White Chocolate Grill. I'll be going back again soon."}
{"text":"I hadn't been here for several months the place I original wanted to go was closed. What a massive mistake this turned out to be. Why? Food poisoning! I've been violently ill, from a veggie burger. It seemed a little soggy, but sometimes that's just how they are. This destroyed my evening and entire day. Thanks White Chocolate. How about get your sh*t together?! To say I'm furious, would be an understatement. Poor service or something of that nature is excusable. Making someone extremely ill because of carelessness in the kitchen is NOT. I will never return, the thought of walking through the door alone makes me sick."}
{"text":"(Lyrics - Billy Idol - White Wedding)  Hey little Yelper, what have you tried? Hey little Yelper, who's the only one? Hey little Yelper, how's your food reviews? Hey little Yelper, what's the drink you want? Hey little Yelper, Bo Bites  It's a nice place to eat again It's a nice place at The White Chocolate Grill It's a nice place for Star reviews   The White Chocolate Grill is a staple of the North Scottsdale area.  When I'm in need a spot to hit up for some good eats this is probably my pick for a sure bet.  I came here many a times, but usually ordering burgers and steak.  This time around I went for a salad and a fish dish.  My partner and I ordered the Kale & Spinach Salad with goat cheese and raisins added and for the fish entree we shot for the Blackened Mahi.  Overall, I'm glad we added the goat cheese adding an extra sweet but creamy texture to the salad.  The salad originally came with chicken, strawberries, carrots, candied nuts and tossed in a Asian honey vinaigrette.  Overall, a solid salad of crunchy bites and a fresh start to our meal.  Our entree was cooked to perfection with a creamy Creole sauce and crab meat.  The fish itself was moist and meaty.  Service here is always stellar and on point.  We sat at the bar enjoying the view of the game and a beautifully display of drinks.  Whiskey flights to your liking and interesting cocktails; the Chocolate Grill does not disappoint! - Enjoy!"}
{"text":"I hate to give 3 stars because the food is really pretty good, however the service was awful.  We've been here at least 25 times over the years and the service has steadily declined.   The prices have increased but the quality of service has not.  Our server would disappear for periods of time and we'd have to ask someone else for things.  She also had a condescending attitude.    -As far as the food the artichoke appetizer is outstanding and the kids menu has great options for a reasonable price- large piece of salmon and nice portion of ribs.  Our meals were pretty good but overpriced.   Amazing how bad service can really put a damper on your meal.  At this price point service needs to be better. Next time we will go to Houston's."}
{"text":"I cannot say enough good things about the white chocolate grill.  There has never been a time where I have had a bad, or even an average meal.  Everything is always wonderful from the food to the servers and even the drinks!    I am obsessed with the crab cakes, that is kind of my go to meal, but the chicken and ribs are out of this world-definitely a Place you will want to come to hungry. They also have hands down the best tortilla soup I have had in the area.   I also always look forward to their specials.  It's always exciting when you find out they have a house special fish on the menu the evening you arrive, or when they have the spaghetti squash side available, that's the best and there are very few places that will even attempt that.    For finishing, you always have to get dessert-the white chocolate brownie  is a must, but if you're feeling adventurous, try the apple pie.  You don't expect it but it is hot and fresh out of the oven with a giant scoop of ice cream on almost like a puff pastry croissant crust- you will not be sorry.  I also have to commend this restaurant for its consistently great service. There are not a lot of places you can go to count on having a great server no matter if you are seated at the bar or in the dining room, or if you are a party of 2 or 10, and white chocolate grill makes it happen every time.  I will continue to come here and bring guests here and recommend this to friends."}
{"text":"There are two types of experiences you can have here; very good personalized weekDAY service, and very rushed and sterile crappy weekEND service.  Most recently my mom and I came here on a Friday, we made reservations and were seated right at the reservation time. It was very busy so I definitely recommend the reservation.  Our server was nice and smiled a lot but I have no idea what her name was and she had the personality of a beer coozy,  helpful but not necessary. She was obviously very busy because we were greeted by one person, had our drinks dropped off by someone else, she took our order and then another new person dropped the food off.   The food was okay. Nothing amazing, but good. We ended up taking some home as leftovers. If your dish comes with a sauce that you would like to take home, you have to ask them for a separate container, they only bring you the one box for everything.  About $25 each for one entree and one glass of wine.   I'm not rushing back any time soon."}
{"text":"I've been coming here since they first opened.  Consistent quality of service and great food make me a frequent diner here.  Plenty of seating area makes easy to get seated right away during lunch time.  Perfect for business lunch, with variety of menu, we all can find something we like to eat.  My favorite is Tomato Gin Soup, followed by Ahi Tuna Salad.  I like the hamburger, grilled salmon, crab cake... I don't think I ever had anything I didn't like.  Don't forget the desert too. Can't pick my favorites. All good.  Desert potion is large enough to share with others. I wish they have smaller portion desert, then I will be ordering desert all the time."}
{"text":"Good food.  Fairly priced.  Comfortable atmosphere."}
{"text":"Dined here a couple of nights ago. Excellent food, wine and service. My friend had the jambalaya and said it was the best he has ever had! Cobb salad with steak was also a winner. Always enjoy coming here as it is very consistent."}
{"text":"I absolutely love this place. The service is always great and they have a good beer selection. I usually get the chicken crepes and they are good but the tomato gin soup is amazing, I've never had anything like it before. I definitely crave it at least once a month. We always get dessert, nothing beats the white chocolate brownie!"}
{"text":"The food was good. What did we eat?  We had the Jumbo Shrimp, The Blackened Mahi, The Mahi burger, The Trout and something I can't remember. For dessert, we had the bread pudding and the white chocolate brownie.  I recommend the Blackened Mahi (not the burger). For some reason, the burger came out cold and not cooked. The regular dish came out fine. Plus, crab on top of Mahi... how can you go wrong? It's delicious. But if you get a bad burger, let them know ASAP.  Service was pretty decent. The desserts are probably what they are good at it. The main dishes were ok... So if you are here for desserts, it will be less of a disappointment. But if you are in the area looking for a posh place to eat, this is it."}
{"text":"Ok I am a fan.  First of all, great job with the name.  It's catchy and peaks your attention.    I came here with 2 co-workers after a day at the office.  None of us live in Phoenix so we found this place through Yelp and loved the name.  Plus it got good reviews.  The interior of this restaurant looks very expensive.  Darker woods, an expansive bar, an open kitchen.   It's very clean and crisp and you feel as if you may be sitting in an exclusive steak house.  The menu is wonderful!  Tons of fresh soups, salads, sandwiches, and entree's to choose from.  I love this fresh, upscale American dining experience and The White Chocolate Grill nails it.   The prices are unbelievably reasonable for where you are and what you are getting.  I got the rotisserie chicken because they described it on the menu with \"really good gravy\".  Again, great marketing because we all know that really good gravy can make your whole meal.    It was wonderful.  The chicken was perfectly seasoned and tender and juicy, and the gravy was, in fact, really good.   I also had a few bites of the chicken tortilla soup and loved every slurp.  I was too full to order dessert which kind of upset me because I was looking forward to trying the white chocolate banana cream pie.   Although I would have had to unbutton my pants, I hear it's worth it."}
{"text":"Its our daughter's 10th birthday today!  We've been coming here since she was about 3 WEEKS old!  One of our go-to places.  The serve baby back ribs on the kids menu and that is what she normally gets and its a very nice sized portion! Me and wife always share the prime rib dip and it is always nice and tender!  The shoestring froes arw always a fav of mine.   We always share the artichoke and spinach dip as an appetizer and that is always a crowd pleaser!! Of course the grand prize here is the white chocolate brownie!  It is one of the most decadent desserts that you will have...a must try!!!  Enjoy!"}
{"text":"I wanted to share what I remembered what we enjoyed about this restaurant with our adult children.  My husband ordered the prime rib, we were very unhappy with the meet.  It truly tasted as if it was cooked under the warming lights.  No flavor and rubbery.   I know we will not be going back at the $$'s we spent, Wendy does better."}
{"text":"I met my friend and her mom here tonight for dinner. We got here pretty early which was great because by the time we left, it was standing room early. Gotta love those early dinners :)   We were seated in the bar area and were promptly asked our drink order. When our first waiter arrived, he seemed friendly at first but when I asked him if the flirtini drink was any good, he proceeded to say \" If it wasn't good it wouldn't be on the menu\" We were like, that is not necessarily true but hmm ok. (Needless to say it was good though)   I ordered the plate of sliders which came with miniatures of the WCG Cheeseburger, BBQ Bacon Burger and Maytag Burger and french fries. I asked that my fries be made without salt because lately I have noticed that fries seem to be caked with salt. Needless to say that when my fries arrived they were COVERED in salt. Ewwww... I looked around and out of nowhere, our new waitress Tiffany (who was also manning the bar) came over and asked if everything was ok. I told her that I had asked for fries with no salt and she said lets just leave these here and I will get some fresh ones out to you. About 5 mins later this huge plate of piping hot no salt added fries arrived and needless to say I devoured all of them. Yes I know greedy but they were so good. Oh and the miniature burgers were yummy as well but ended up bringing home a mini because I was stuffed from all the fries.   My friend and her mom ordered the rotisserie Chicken Rotisserie Chicken Crêpes which were filled with rotisserie chicken, spinach and a mushroom cream sauce and topped with madeira sauce and parmesan cheese. They both said that it was really good. We also ordered the AZ egg rolls which were traditional egg rolls filled with spicy grilled chicken, corn, black beans and jack cheeses. They had a salsa dip and a jalapeno dip and they were quite yummy.   Now for dessert, my friend and her mom ordered white chocolate brownie to share. It had french vanilla ice cream, a warm white chocolate brownie, chocolate sauce and whipped cream with white chocolate shavings. I am not a fan of white chocolate but they both seemed to enjoy it.   So my experience at WCG was all in all a good one. I was with my fabulous friend and her adorable mom, plus Tiffany went above and beyond for us by just making sure we were ok. Hats off to you girl!"}
{"text":"Went here when my parents were in town, and then again with a visiting sister.  Both times it was spot on.  Reasonable prices for what you get.  Excellent all around."}
{"text":"Maxwell was an awesome server! This place has outstanding service and even better food! Try the spinach dip!!! One of the best I've ever had!! We also had the Cajun chicken sandwich, it was amazing! Loved the fries and the homemade ranch! We also had the white chocolate brownie it was amazing!! This place is phenomenal! We're coming back for sure"}
{"text":"This place is swanky. Pretty cool. Out of all the great food here. The most memorable thing is the Caesar salad. It's incredible. The best I've had and it's my default salad. 5"}
{"text":"My husband and I come into the restaurant about twice a month. We love the ambiance and the food. But I cannot help notice the last few times that we have been in there we have heard the general manager talk down to his employees openly in the restaurant. One of the instances happened to be tonight. I happen to be a restaurant manager and this is unacceptable. I will be making sure that the owner will know about my experience tonight. I will not be returning to the restaurant and I will making sure my friends know about this."}
{"text":"Being that my office is near this restaurant, I have probably been here about 20 times in the last three years. The staff are always accommodating and friendly. The assortment on the menu is excellent, and everything I've ever ordered there has met or exceeded my expectations. The ambience is quite inviting, but it is not a place for young children. One of my favorite things on the menu is a turkey dip sandwich that comes with a side of mushroom gravy. It is delicious! In addition, their couscous cannot be beat. My favorite dessert...when I allow myself to have one!... Is the white chocolate bread pudding. It is simply a slice of heaven! If you're looking for a great place to meet somebody for lunch or a romantic dinner, this is the place. Some of the menu items can be a little pricey, but their food is the best. As I said, I have been here several times throughout the past few years and I've never had one problem with my order. This is one of my favorite places restaurants in the Valley! Try it...you'll love it!"}
{"text":"Ribeye was really good!  I've had ribeye at quite a few places, but this one was mouthwatering."}
{"text":"My hubby and I were in the area and saw this place had good reviews so we gave it a go.  Why does this place have 4 star reviews, let alone 5?!  Place was packed, ambiance was pleasing but service reminded me of being on a commission-based sales floor with how many people/times interrupted our 25 minute visit. Now on to the food...  Cold mashed potatoes in water... I mean gravy - we thought maybe they were trying something avant-garde but nope, they were in fact cold mashed potatoes which were quickly - I assume - microwaved since they were returned to our table in about 2 minutes.  Soggy blackened fish burger with bun and condiment quality akin to In-N-Out Burger (I'm not exaggerating - check out the pics).  Watery cream-based gin tomato soup (house specialty).  Wish I had something to rave about here.  So I figured out what the 4 star rating is for: the ambiance and PRICE (too expensive for this quality of food)!  There are so many great restaurants of similar pricing in Scottsdale - I recommend you head to one of those and pass by the White Chocolate Grill."}
{"text":"We saw this place on Yelp after a long day moving in and decided to give it a try.   The food was terrific.   My husband had the Balsamic Ribeye and I had the ribs.    Both were outstanding.   Loved that they have a gluten free menu. Service was quick and very friendly.   Looks like this place will be on our list!"}
{"text":"Yes, it may be a chain (there are locations in Vegas and Chicago too), but WCG is a special restaurant... with top notch service, awesome food & drinks, fun atmosphere, and moderate prices, I have to give 5 stars.  I almost don't want to give 5 stars, just because they're a chain, but after my experience there tonight, I feel they deserve an all-star rating!  I arrived first (as usual) and put our name in (party of 4)... it was prime time (7:30 on a Friday night), so I expected a wait.  (They don't take reservations during dinner; only lunch).  I was given a beeper thing, and no more than 5 minutes later, it vibrated.  The rest of my party was not even there yet!  The hostess sat me anyways - there was a great table available in the bar area.    Alicia was our server and approached me within minutes of sitting down to take my drink order.  I also ordered the artichoke appetizer for the table.  The rest of my party arrived and Alicia was back to take their drink orders. share the specials, answer questions, etc...  3 of us ordered the crab cake entree (2 with a side of broccoli and 1 with a side of honey roasted carrots) - and my dad had the halibut with fries... everything was delicious!  The crab cakes are not breaded at all; they melt in your mouth!  The broccoli is steamed just right and sprinkled with parmesan and some special seasoning that makes it taste great.  The carrots are sweet like candy.  I didn't have any, but the fries that came with the fish looked good too!  In the past, I've also had the Four Cheese Spinach & Artichoke Dip (served with warm tortilla chips and salsa), the Rotisserie Chicken Tortilla Soup, and several salads... I've always been impressed with the quality, taste, and serving sizes too!  I didn't tonight, but if you can - save room for dessert!  The desserts are actually listed at the top of the menu, so they stand-out - for good reason!  They are all phenomenal!  My favorites are the White Chocolate Brownie, the White Chocolate Banana Cream Pie with Graham Cracker Crust, and the apple pie a la mode!  Yes, the menu is similar to Houston's; yes, the bar is a replica of Ocean Club... but, the service and quality of WCG make this place unique and worth every bit of the 5 star rating I'm giving them!  EDIT: Service on a Friday night was not quite as great... I'll keep their 5 star review, but i'm rounding up now from a 4.5.  We'll see what happens next visit!"}
{"text":"We saw the reviews on this place and we were not disappointed!!!  Chicken Enchiladas were great!  Chicken Madeira was yummy! To top it off we enjoyed the banana cream pie dessert....mmmmmmm.   Highly recommend this spot!"}
{"text":"I had such a wonderful lunch experience here, that I took my dad back for dinner.    The Ahi grade tuna burger I had for lunch was simply divine.  It was a special, and I expected it to cost more than the reasonable price of $11.99.  It was so very delicious.  The service was excellent, and it's obvious that this restaurant prides itself on teamwork and efficiency.    My dinner experience was wonderful as well.  We both ordered salads, and they were excellent.  We also ordered desert, both the brownie and the cheesecake.  The brownie was good, but the cheesecake was to die for.  I will definitely be dining here again."}
{"text":"Food was excellent. French dip sandwich was excellent and had no fat on it. The banana cream pie was excellent too. Service was excellent and all servers seem to help out. A little bit pricey but overall was an excellent place to eat."}
{"text":"It has been 7 years since I last visited The White Chocolate Grill at Scottsdale, AZ. Back then, I was dating a good friend of mine. I guess the date went so well and the food was really good, she ended up marrying me 4 years after. After dating for 4 years and married for 3 years, my now wife and I decided to revisit The White Chocolate Grill.  Now in our casual attire instead of a dress and a suit, we got a chance to enjoy and focus on the food, the service and the ambience of the place. I did remember one particular appetizer from their menu. They still had the Grilled Artichoke. I loved it so much back then that I tried to eat everything on the plate. Even the choke and the leaves ( just to be honest, I didn't know which part to eat. So I ate everything. I was trying to be cool. I WAS ON A DATE!!! Note: only eat the heart).  The Food: We had the Ahi Tuna Salad and the Grilled Chicken Madeira for dinner and the White Chocolate Brownie for dessert. Everything was fantastic!   The Ahi Tuna salad was very light and refreshing. The sesame crusted Ahi Tuna was seared rare to perfection and served with field greens, mango, avocado, cherry tomatoes and cucumbers then lightly dressed with a champagne vinaigrette. The combination of the tangy and sweet vinaigrette complemented the salt water freshness of the ahi tuna. The sesame crust and avocado gave texture to each bite. The mango and cherry tomatoes gave balance to the dish while the greens and cucumber gave the fresh taste in your mouth that makes you believe that you are actually eating something healthy.  The Grilled Chicken Madeira was hearty and satisfying. A serving plate had 3 pieces of marinated chicken breasts grilled to order and then served in a savory mushroom sauce with a hint of tarragon and a choice of side. We decided to go with the Israeli Couscous topped with roasted pistachios. The chicken breast was very tender and juicy. It was also seasoned well enough to stand on its own even without the mushroom sauce. I did find the mushroom sauce a tad on the salty side (it can be overlooked since it compliments with the couscous).  The couscous was a winner! It was al dente to the bite and was seasoned well. The chopped mint leaves and apple slices cuts through the savory mushroom sauce that just complimented each other so well. The dried cranberry and toasted pistachio provided texture, contrast and balance for the dish. I wouldn't hesitate to order this again on my next visit.   The White Chocolate Brownie was a warm blonde brownie with white chocolate shavings and topped with French Vanilla Ice Cream, chocolate sauce and whipped cream. It is sweet! Literally! I guess theres a reason why the menu says \"Desserts for Two\". Because the dessert is meant to be shared. It would be overwhelmingly sweet for one person to finish the whole plate. Just imagine the combination of the blonde brownie, chocolate sauce and chocolate shavings. Even the vanilla ice cream and whipped cream is not enough to cut through the sweetness. Don't get me wrong. It's not bad. I actually think it's a good way to end your meal while enjoying a cup of coffee and a good (or maybe sweet) conversation. Just take time enjoying the dessert.  The Service: Our server for the night was Angel. She was an angel. She recommended the Israeli Couscous over the Mardi Gras Rice for our Grilled Chicken Madeira. I think it was the perfect side for the savory mushroom sauce. She also kept our glass full. Which means she kept track of our meal the whole time. Since we mentioned that my wife and I were sharing everything, extra plates and utensils were always provided as each order was served. We never felt rushed and we never felt unattended. It is worth noting that it was a busy dinner service at the time we were there. Kudos to Angel!  The Ambience: The whole place was very cozy and relaxed. There was an area with a bar and the latest sporting event for the night on TV. There was also an area where you enjoy your meal with a good conversation. It is both classic and sophisticated.  Overall, it was a great meal experience. Good food, good service and overall nice and relax place. Now, why did I to wait for 7 years before the second visit? With this kind of a quality restaurant, maybe the third visit should be anytime soon.  Read my other reviews at http://themealexperience.blogspot.com"}
{"text":"First time here. We choose to come here during Restaurant Week with the prefixed menu.  We started with the AZ egg rolls. They were okay, I've definitely had better. They did come with a tasty ranch/dill dipping sauce.  We both got the green field salad. It was very fresh and the dressing was light and just the right amount.  For dinner I ordered the Park Avenue NY strip, which was outstanding. It comes covered in the most delicious mushroom sauce. I got the Israel couscous and broccoli as sides. The couscous is to die for while the broccoli was a tad cold and lack luster. My mother got the filet, which was very tender and flavorful. She got the mashed potatoes, which unfortunately were bland and an extremely small portion, and the honey glazed carrots. The carrots were not good at all. Overcooked and a weird texture.  For dinner I got the white chocolate brownie, which was stale at first but they quickly replaced it. Th new brownie met my expectations and is just as good as everyone raves about. My mom got the silky soufflé, very rich and decadent. The desserts were overall delicious but then again I'm a sweets girl.  All in all it was a decent meal. The service was good, a few little hiccups, and the ambience is nice. Nothing to rave about but it did have its positives."}
{"text":"We came here for Valentine's day dinner as a special treat. I was a little disappointed with the food. For the price I was definitely expecting way better food but this seemed nothing to write home about. The best part was the appetizer, grilled artichoke with parmesan cheese with lemon aioli. That definitely would get 5 stars on its own. However, the runner who brought out our food took my artichoke and it was only half eaten! I asked them to bring me another one to replace it since that's like throwing half your meal away. Not sure if we'll be back but we shall see."}
{"text":"Was visiting from out of town and we found this place via yelp. The atmosphere is so perfect for a relaxing enjoyable night out. We started in the bar and ended up staying and having our meal in there. The frisky whiskey, was delicious and highly recommended. All of our meals were plated beautifully and cooked to perfection. Our waitress was knowledgeable, friendly and even though busy, she did not act rushed when we asked her for recommendations. In fact everyone we dealt with was friendly and welcoming. For great food and a great night out, you can't go wrong here."}
{"text":"We tried the apple pie and white chocolate banana cream pie. I loved the apple pie was simply delicious, as well as, the cream pie. I would definitely recommend!!!"}
{"text":"We love the restaurant but hate having to sit through the server trying to up sell you on everything!  And I mean everything. The food (except the banana cream pie dessert) is great and has a great atmosphere.  Please let us order what we want and quit wasting everyone's time."}
{"text":"Great American/ fancy food, always busy.  Attentive and professional wait staff."}
{"text":"This place is wonderful in its simplicity.  My friends and I decided to stop by WCG to have dessert. I have been dreaming of their bread pudding for about 5 years. LOL. That was the last time I had it.   Who said Dreamd don't come TRUE!!! LOL I had the best bread pudding know to man. It was surrounded by a white creamy ocean of goodness.. Of course the waiter brought two forks, which was a good call.    Then out comes the blond brownie topped with whip cream and shredded white chocolate... Ohhhh myyyy worrrrrrd..... This is incredible...   We can't forget about the apple pie.  It's round like a pizza pie.  This place is great to hang out with friends or a quite Sunday Brunch...."}
{"text":"Got the blackened mahi and it was overcooked. For a $25 entree, they could absolutely do better. The sauce was flavorful but the fish itself was bland. I love fish but it was not that good. The mashed potatoes were light and fluffy but again, only saved by the sauce. I wasn't impressed."}
{"text":"Fancy, shmancy.  This place is really nice. The interior is impeccable and very attractive. The service fantastic. The servers here are well trained, very friendly, high-class professionals. Feels like a one-off, high brow, downtown, dining establishment for power players.  The food is really good quality. You can tell a lot of effort goes into making things just right.  I had the balsamic rib-eye.  The meat was very tender and juicy. The balsamic flavor was way too strong for my liking. It is essentially a steak soaked in vinegar. I'm sure if my palate was more refined, I would enjoy this, but it's a bit too refined for my middle-class taste buds. For the foodies out there - it would probably be the cat's meow.   My taste leans toward steak with butter and salt with a side of mashed potatoes. And I can speak to the mashed potatoes here: exquisite. The kind of potatoes you hear about in legends. Fluffy, creamy, and full of fresh, solid potato flavor. They must fly the potatoes in from Idaho on the Concord each morning. I would come here just for the mashed potatoes. I don't have to tell you they were lump free - of course they were!  Overall, if you want to be pampered by high-class, professional servers who make you feel at home in a wonderful setting, and you like fancy food - this is a great place to check out."}
{"text":"The food is very good, the desserts are excellent, and the atmosphere is really nice.  The only complaint I have is that the wait staff comes to your table WAY too often.  I know that sounds like an odd complaint - most people complain if they don't check up enough - but every twenty seconds there was someone there.  We couldn't carry on a conversation because between every single sentence a new member of the wait staff was there to check up on you.  We counted 11 different staff members total, and several of them came to our table multiple times.  It's a minor inconvenience at best, and like I said, everything else was fantastic.  I will definitely go back."}
{"text":"If you want food that's going to pop with distinct delicious flavors you should come here. The atmosphere is really nice I would say that I'm glad a wore a dress if I had worn jeans I would've felt underdressed but it was a nice casual dress. We had the seared tuna salad which was fantastic and really fresh! Then my mom and I shared a burger with blue cheese and bacon with fries that had garlic flavors that were excellent! The service was impeccable I never needed to ask for a refill they were very attentive. I would recommend this place for a nice night out on the town to anyone in this area!"}
{"text":"I was seated in the bar area and let me tell you the energy level with the music playing was outstanding! We had the citrus soy glazed and Atlantic salmon dishes that came out in ten minutes ! Lastly the staple desert is by far the white chocolate raspberry cheesecake, delicious! Be back soon."}
{"text":"Came here with my god-daughter to celebrate her 18th birthday.  We had a great time and it was perfect.  I ordered the New York Strip and their mash potatoes.  Cooked to perfection....  Roast Prime Rib with asparagus.  She inhaled the whole prime rib and all the veggies.  WOW, I think she loved it?  LOL!  We had White Chocolate Brownie for dessert:  A Warm Blonde Brownie, Freshly Baked with Callebaut Chocolate and Topped with French Vanilla Ice Cream, Warm Chocolate Sauce and Whipped Cream.  It was so good!  The service was outstanding."}
{"text":"Though we live in TX, we always eat and drink at the White Chocolate. We especially love the happy hour there. Inexpensive apps, perfectly made cocktails at great prices, great atmosphere, what's not to like? We have never had a bad experience at the White Chocolate Grill. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"Sure the food is low in price, but it is also cheap in quality. They cover everything with made up unhealthy sauces. The service was annoyingly attentive, the \"ambiance\" music was distracting. Overall a place that wants to be super fancy but leaves much to be desired. \"Different\" traditional food is an oxymoron for a reason."}
{"text":"Very solid menu and atmosphere.  Turkey French Dip and the Steak sandwich are excellent options.  Desserts are excellent too.  Good one to have in the rotation"}
{"text":"This place has a special place in my heart! My boyfriend at the time (husband now) would take me here for our anniversary dinner date. It has always been a anniversary tradition and i don't see myself breaking that tradition anytime soon!   Not only the atmosphere is set just right but the food is outstanding!! My husband orders the same thing he ordered when we were just Bf/Gf and that's the steak platter! I always get the steak sandwich and it's to die for! Both entrees are exquisite and full of awesome flavors! They always start you off with chips & salsa and you can never go wrong with their cocktail menu.   Remember to always finish your meal with their famous white chocolate brownie dessert. It's to die for! Scrumptious and warm and you get the vanilla bean cold ice cream kick all in one bite."}
{"text":"four star average? Why? This place is a chain restaurant with a silly name - the family made me eat here and I will tell you this - the only thing four star here are the sexy tall young fit waiters.... everything else is weak and salty...  At least they serve bourbon - but seriously the cocktail menu was silly and the preparation by the untrained bartenders was obvious - silly rolls with honey butter oh that's cute -  the food was applebees meets outback  - one of those taste of the world menus - my dad was silly enough to order the prime rib - it looked like a swanson frozen dinner - poor dad - IT IS CALLED WHITE CHOCOLATE GRILL - what does that mean - oh it means we are silly and have duped people into thinking we are a trendy restaurant.  So sad - seriously the service is lovely and attentive the food is better prepared and home with more flavor and less salt - i guess the real french fries - the string kind were yummy but I needed to up my BP meds.  oh and a funny decor thing - they use rolled up, stacked utensils in napkins as sorta sculptural decor around the restaurant - sorta weird"}
{"text":"The food here is delicious. I had the citrus-soy salmon with honey glazed carrots. My husband had the BBQ trio which was ribs, chicken, and pulled pork with a side of Brussels sprouts. We shared a bread pudding for dessert. Everything was perfect! There was a mix-up in the kitchen and our order was lost. The manager came out and explained what happened and comped the two dinners! What a great way to insure we return, and we definitely will. Excellent service as well."}
{"text":"This is the place to be apparently!  Excellent service, good food, and heaters on the patio!   My experience with the restaurant is from hosting a happy hour for an organization in which I am involved.   Parking: easy - it's in this shopping center with all these other stores, similar to one of the other billions of outdoor strip mall type things in the valley.   Service: amaze! We had a very handsome guy and lady help us out for the happy hour event. They were attentive, nice, and provided suggestions. This was a happy hour for individuals in the health field, and they provided ideas for veg-based foods.  The waters were refilled every few minutes, and the food came out super quickly and was good.   Food:   One can order happy hour foods only at the bar, so we did not.  We ordered: Chips and guac, ahi tuna, chips and artichoke dip, Brusells sprouts, caprese salad, roasted carrots, and a few other items for folks to share.  The grilled artichokes/dip were delicious! This was a unique dish. The caprese salad and roasted carrots were also tasty. The artichoke dip was mostly cheese and very little artichoke or spinach.  The roasted carrots were warm and slightly sweet -soft but not mushy.   Ambiance: Chill, seemingly like any other trendy chain place.   This place was *packed* on a Tuesday night at 6-6:30pm. I did not realize it was such a happenin' place, but with the service and good food, I can see why!"}
{"text":"This was my first visit here. Although I was disappointed by the food, I was highly impressed by the service. Tara was an amazing server: nice, competent, and always checking on us. They also have a support team that refills drinks, removes dirty plates, etc. The service was five star quality.  I was so disappointed by the food though! Some things could be chalked up to individual tastes, i.e. I didn't like cold queso. But I found my prime rib to be quite tough and flavorless. My entire family was let down by the white chocolate brownie and the chocolate soufflé cake. We found them to be mushy and forgettable.  We had wanted to visit here for some time, but don't think we'll be back. If you do go, tip your servers well. They work very hard."}
{"text":"Oh my heavens, can you say D-E-L-I-C-I-O-U-S???? This place has the most amazing food ever that is home made.  I cannot wait to try more on the menu along with the desserts which im really bummed we did not get to try.  The chicken crepes were out of this world with the honey carrots.  I tried replicating and could not even come close to how good those were. Mouth watering goodness. Make sure if you get fries to get the house ranch they also happen to make from scratch its unbelievable.  If I win the lottery I would eat here every day and not get sick of it!"}
{"text":"Their Filet Mignon Cobb is my all time favorite there, its already perfectly tossed in dressing and is a meal.. not bird food by any means. I have also tried their mushroom/chicken crepes and Im not a crepes fan and I was more than impressed. Great place for a date or just meeting a friend out for a bite. Its swanky yet you won't feel uncomfortable dressed down. Not pretentious and the waitstaff is fantastic. My only complaint is on their mashed potatoes..too much oil and they're whipped to death.. but hey i like mine with lumps..so it's a preference thing."}
{"text":"An okay to mediocre experience translates to a 3 star rating on Yelp. That is exactly the rating The White Chocolate Grill deserves.   Food: We ordered mashed potatoes, but were told they were out of them. However, the waitress told us that they had french fries. I would like to think a restaurant serving french fries can also serve mashed potatoes as they both come from the same original source, the potato. However, they probably use frozen french fries. They were also out of the white chocolate bread pudding.  The alcohol was not great. While they do have a varied range menu options with great aesthetic appeal, the mixing was not proportional. Either too little or too much alcohol. However, it wasn't bad - just not perfect.  Entrees was A-OK. The Jambalaya was underspiced and tasteless. As a Jambalaya fan, this was the worst Jambalaya I have tasted. I tried a little bit of the hamburger meat to get an idea of the quality. It was okay.  Tomato soup was pretty good. Probably the best thing they had.  Dessert: Because they were out of the white chocolate bread pudding, we asked for the white chocolate brownie. Again, it looked fantastic - but the quality was not great. It was too sweet and didn't go down easy. Almost like an Applebee's dessert. It's easy to see when a dessert option was prepared with time and craft. These weren't.  Service: Good service. They didn't charge us for the white chocolate brownie because the waitress felt bad that they didn't have a lot of the things we ordered. She was professional, but nothing exceptional."}
{"text":"Fantastic food, service and atmosphere!  I loved their ribs and salad.  I will put White Chocolate Grill on my list of regular stops."}
{"text":"Great fish selection, knowledgeable wait staff.  Menu is varied with appetizers, soups, sandwiches, salads, steaks, and fish.  Great side selection that goes beyond the typical potatoes, including honey carrots, brussel sprouts, and couscous.  Easily would appeal to a diverse crowd.  Will definitely come back."}
{"text":"Delicious grilled artichoke, very good salads. Big and filling. I would definitely have the same meal again!"}
{"text":"By far one of my favorite places to visit. Really great atmosphere, top notch food, phenomenal customer service. You really can't go wrong with this restaurant. This is a must do in AZ!"}
{"text":"This place was suggested by a local who had just moved here from CA. As for the service all I have to say is amazing!  it's not just one person serving you but everybody around you.Everybody's nice and polite and willing to help.   Great ambiance!!  We loved it so much we returned the next day, the only negative thing I have to say is the person that was working up front short red hair the hostess. She was unlike the rest with an attitude and no willingness to help us get seated and a proper table for six. That was the only negative thing I found and I think of management handles that this place is hands down one of the top restaurants in AZ."}
{"text":"I went with my servers choice while visiting this restaurant, I ended up having the soy salmon. It was definitely a great choice and was delicious to the last bite but was kind of on the expensive side. The interior of this restaurant is gorgeous, the staff was a little bit on the slow side though."}
{"text":"Wow! This place is good! It started with our server, Amanda, and just kept getting better. Amanda was pleasant and prompt with service.  I had the Ahi Tuna Burger cooked perfectly- seared rare  My wife had the crab cakes that are actually CRAB cakes.  This place is definitely a place to come back and you haven't been, put it on your list."}
{"text":"First time here and no need to come back. Nothing special and overpriced. Ordered a sandwich with fries...fries were very thin with too much salt and the portion was very, very small. We were attended to by at least five different people who didn't give us a moments peace. It was impossible to have a conversation with the constant interruptions. The staff started clearing the empty plates from our table while some in our party were still eating. They were very rudely reaching over those who was still eating to get dishes off the table and then left the check before we were even done eating. It appeared they were rushing us out of there but no reason to do so it was a Sunday afternoon and place was not even 25% full."}
{"text":"Great food. Great service. It's always crowded so making reservations is best. Get your open table points!! Had the filet mignon and was cooked perfectly! The server was so sweet with every request! Must dine here!!"}
{"text":"This place was incredible. Great service and EXCELLENT food. My wife and I both had the Balsamic steak with veggies. We split a dessert of the white chocolate brownie. This was one of the best dinners we've had in a very long time. Food, drinks, dessert all for less than $80 in a classy environment. You cannot go wrong here."}
{"text":"Upbeat place with good food and liquor. I had the ahi tuna app and the az egg roll and that was enough for dinner. Decent price and sports on the tv at the bar."}
{"text":"A glorified applebees. Didn't eat my meal. I don't understand why it is getting high reviews. I couldn't stand it. The appetizer was ehhh the salad was filet salad was gross the barbecue was unremarkable. I was expecting something much better."}
{"text":"We have been here many times in the past 5 or 6 years and it has always been ok. It is not a fabulous restaurant but it is (usually) better than most. Upsides: it has a very broad menu. Most anyone can find something there that they should like. Extensive bar menu, whiskies and bourbons in particular at pretty fair prices. While the kitchen can be inconsistent, it is usually good enough. Down sides: it can be, and usually is, unbearably loud in the dining room. The hostesses can be a little off putting and your table is almost never ready at your reserved time. We ate their last week and everything was so good that we came back last night with a group of 6. Things didn't go quite as well this time. Two of us had the chicken and rib combo and while their rotisserie chicken is always quite good, the ribs were just horrible. Do not under any circumstances order them. VERY little meat on the bones and what was there was bone dry. Should never have been served. Speaking of service, our server (I wish that I could remember his name) was just fantastic. Really personable and professional. Another less than positive factor was that many of our drinks ended up costing significantly more than we anticipated because of various preparation upcharges that get tacked on. The final blow was the 2 desserts that we split (bread pudding and a white chocolate brownie sundae thing) both just sucked. While we will likely return it will probably not be for quite a while."}
{"text":"I adore this place, I'm a BIG fan! I have been here 3 times and I have only known about it 3 months! This place is classy and clean! The first time I was there me and my Fiancee sat at the bar ( Which was a gorgeous well stocked bar) we had lunch we both got chicken sandwiches OMG Delicious!  They have the BEST desert! We are big Fans of bread pudding so we got the white chocolate bread pudding! OMG wow! Very good! We were very impressed. The cost for that was like $30.00 it was quite cheap! We received WONDERFUL service. The next time we went was on a Friday evening and we were celebrating my new employment. They had a date night menu which we decided to order off of. The date night menu Included appetizers, two salad, two entrees  and a desert. it also included a drink, or for a little more a bottle of wine. We got the spinach artichoke dip, which was good, we got there WCG salad OMG so good! I had got the prime rib and my fiancee the rotisserie chicken and ribs... All of it was delicious! Then finally desert we did the white chocolate bread pudding becuase it was so good last time! The price was good we spent $58.00 plus tip so it was fairly inexpensive considering all we got. Again Great service and  GOOD food! The last time i went i went with my sister. She loved it, we got the WCG salad and shared a chicken sandwich all oh so good! This time I switched up the desert. We got the white chocolate brownie! oh my it was tasty! I will definitely return! Every time I go good food, great service and its a cool and clean place!"}
{"text":"Made a reservation through Open Table which was quick easy and convenient.  Indicated that my party of 4 was celebrating a birthday. When we arrived we were enthusiastically greeted and seated right a way.  We were quickly then greeted by our server who acknowledged that we were celebrating a special occasion.  Server was attentive, friendly and knowledgeable.  Food was really good.  When it came time for dessert our server brought the dessert menu and asked if we would like to celebrate my birthday with a d desert.  He's words implied that the dessert was complimentary.  When the bill arrived we realized no complimentary dessert.  This was the only negative about our experience.  Overall good service and good food."}
{"text":"I never leave this place disappointed. I am always satisfied, full, and content. The Tomato Gin soup is certainly a must.  I've only been here a few times, but in the past have always ordered my own entree, and have never had room for dessert.  This time my wife and I decided to share an entree. Which worked out perfect. We were able to try the bread pudding. It was awesome.  Make sure to save room for dessert."}
{"text":"This was my second trip to The White Chocolate Grill, originally I was drawn to this restaurant by the reviews on Yelp. Then invited on my second visit. This is not a legit 4 star yelp location. Every appetizers I have tried were bland and tired. Entrees were ordinary to say least. Finally the restaurant is starting to smell like a Denny's The service was good, the prices a bit over priced and the look of the restaurant a little dated. Not sure how a restaurant like this manages to get over 400 reviews and 4 stars. Perhaps social media (Yelp) has failed us. Not sure how this happened but 4 stars for The White Chocolate grill brings all the legit 4 star yelp reviews down."}
{"text":"We decided to make the trip to No. Scottsdale today to have lunch at WCG, as it had been recommended by a couple of my coworkers.  It's pretty far for us, but I wanted to see what the place is about since I had been told so much about it.  I pretty much live off of grilled meat.  More specifically, grilled chicken, steak, and salmon. So when I saw the menu item at WCG called \"perfectly grilled salmon\" I was like 'yeah right it's going to be just as boring as salmon is everywhere else.'     But was I ever wrong.  It is just exactly that: perfectly grilled.  It's crispy on the outside and just right in the center. It is so good that I am inclined to go back and find out how they do it.    My Fiance had the baby back ribs, which she said were about a \"7,\" which for her is pretty good.  We also had the white chocolate brownie which was very rich and delicious, but probably not good enough to warrant the calories.  The prices are reasonable, especially for a nice restaurant in Scottsdale. The ambiance is nice and upscale and it would make a great place for second date with someone you are trying to impress."}
{"text":"Service is always great!  Had my favorite grilled chicken sandwich-best in town. Splurged today with the white chocolate brownie dessert. If you've never had it save room, splurge and get it. There is nothing better. Highly recommend this restaurant.  Today our server was Swazey. Great personality, great service. She seemed happy to be there."}
{"text":"3 of us went to dinner here while on a trip.   I ordered the WCG bacon blue cheese salad as a starter.  It never was delivered, so cannot say how good it is :( Also ordered the Rotisserie Chicken on recommendation from the wonderful waitress.  It was as good as she said.  they do it in-house in their rotisserie oven.  very flavorful and juicy.  about a quarter of a chicken.  choice of one side:  french fries, Israeli Couscous, Freshly Mashed Potatoes, Steamed Broccoli or Honey Roasted Carrots.  I had the steamed brocolli- and it was as good as broccoli gets. Others with me had the rotisserie chicken and rib combo.  the ribs literally just fell off of the bone.  one had the broccoli and the other the fries.  The fries were  very good! they also brought us out a sample plate (for free!!!! :) )  of the pork tenderloin and veggie of the night - snap peas.  Both were excellent, and I would order it off of the menu.  wine list was very nice and not just the usual selections.  Lemonade was homemade but very tart. we were originally led to a table  in the bar area, but it was very noisy so we were shown to a table in the back.  much quieter, but the AC vent was right above the tables and made it feel like a meat locker.  we all commented how quick are food got cold from the vent blowing on the food. we made a reseravation for 7:30 on a Tuesday, but it really was not needed.  Very nice atmosphere in the place, except for the noisy bar area.  very reasonable prices for the quality of food."}
{"text":"Been meaning to hit this place up for awhile now and finally had the chance to do so last week. We made reservations, but arrived early and they were very nice to seat us right away despite being early.   Our waitress came over within a few minutes and took drink orders while also filling us in on the various specials of the day. I opted for the filet sandwich and he went with the au jus. Both sandwiches were delicious and I wouldn't hesitate to get either of them again. They also came with fries that were cooked perfectly.  We skipped on the appetizers so we could order one of their amazing sounding desserts and we weren't disappointed. Went with the White Chocolate Banana Cream Pie - \"A Graham Cracker and Chocolate Chunk Crust, Fresh Bananas and Vanilla Pastry Cream. With Caramel, Whipped Cream and Shaved White Chocolate\" - make this happen if you go...seriously.  Overall: A If you want happy hour deals - sit at the bar, otherwise the dining area has great ambiance, and the food won't disappoint!"}
{"text":"Time for an update! I decided to come back since management contacted me to resolve any issues. I'm all about second chances especially if management is willing to improve and make a customer happy.   My hubby came for dinner and it was a whole different experience. Our server was friendly and our food was delicious! I ordered the rotisserie chicken (based on Yelp recommendations) with the side of Brussels sprouts and hubby on ordered the steak sandwich. My rotisserie chicken was so flavorful and I highly recommend that you order it! Hubby liked the steak sandwich. I thought the Brussels sprouts were ok- not a fan of how they made it with nuts and cranberries. We also decided to order the white chocolate brownie since they DO have \"White Chocolate\" in their name. I don't regret ordering and eating it because it was sooooo good! I'm a sucker for sweets and this did not disappoint!  Overall, a way better experience than the last. I still think that prices are above average, but you can always take advantage of happy hour here!"}
{"text":"This is my second time to this restaurant first time in Arizona. The desert was amazing. I noticed somethings they have on the menu in Chicago was not on there, overall our meal was wonderful. We made reservations and was prom promptly seated. Parking was not the greatest as there are a lot of restaurants near by. Outside is a fireplace and indoors was dim and really set the mood. Awesome restaurant."}
{"text":"I don't give excellent scores very often but this restaurant was exceptional. The service, the food, the ambience, even the music was wonderful. Everyone was very friendly and accommodating.  Ashley was a very good server. She even brought new chilled glasses for two people that ordered martini's, I've never experienced that. The prices were very reasonable, even the desserts were excellent and made for 2. I highly recommend this restaurant."}
{"text":"Roommate raved about this place so I had to check it out. Happy I did. Had the Artichoke and spinach dip appitizer. For dinner the Jambalaya. And for dessert the White Chocolate Brownie. Service was spot on for a Saturday night. (They were busy) I will return cause this place made my tummy Happy."}
{"text":"OMG!!!! We are here last night and ordered a bottle of Kim Crawford Sauvignon Blanc at $45.  We just bought the EXACT BOTTLE at $9.75 At COSTCO!!!!! You have got to be kidding!!! Will NEVER order wine there again OR better yet - dine elsewhere!!"}
{"text":"My first visit, I thought this place was dope. Very Non-North Scottsdale... kinda. Whatever this means. I guess its meaning, I was impressed without catching an uncontrollable itch.   It is cool, quaint, a bit chainy... but ok for a new experience.  The basic menu is what you would expect from a chained \"Grill.\" The main reason to visit is the dessert menu, which most of the reviewers have agreed. The White Chocolate Brownie IS better than sex. Yes, ok guys... not many men say this, but obviously you don't know my ex-, unless you were in Old Town Scottsdale 3 months ago and the douchnozzle reading this review. It just wasn't that great, but the White Chocolate Brownie... scrumpths without her 14 yr old boyish figure.  Go with someone that isn't a cadaverous lay and has great taste in dessert delights. You'll be happy with the visit."}
{"text":"The food, service and atmosphere here is top notch. It has a really great vibe and a beautiful Frank Lloyd Wright inspired bar. The menu is really diverse. The champagne vinaigrette is a favorite of mine making any salad delicious. Everything I've had or my friends have had has been incredible--from the fish to the prime rib sandwhich to the drinks. You MUST save room for dessert (hence the restaurant's name.) All desserts are made in house with white chocolate. My favorite is the white chocolate bread pudding made with Godiva white chocolate sauce and croissants. I recommend making a reservation as it gets crowded. The servers are really professional and they provide a great dining experience. Check it out! It's my go-to place to bring out-of-towners."}
{"text":"I went there few days back just for a casual dinner. Had their sandwiches, salads and dessert. Taste, presentation, everything was perfect. Kids meal was too good. The staff behavior was awesome. Would strongly recommend this to anyone."}
{"text":"Had lunch with friends and of course we were not disappointed. WCG is consistently good. Service and food terrific. We all has the Filet Mignon Chopped Salad. Yumm!!!!  I highly recommend WCG to everyone anytime! Another one of my fav's is the Maytag Burger...absolutely delicious!  Go Visit White Chocolate Grill...you will NOT be disappointed...!  Tell them Van sent you!"}
{"text":"Love this place!! the Parmesan crusted fillet is to die for!! I've tried other restaurants fillets and its just not the same. The hubby loves the french dip and just like me he hasn't found a better french dip out there. We love their string fries and the ranch is really good. Not a fan of the cesar salad however we both loved the spring rolls for appetizers. For dessert we have pretty much tried them all. My favorite is the banana cream pie but they are all pretty yummy. The waiters and staff is just amazing. about a year ago when we came for dinner i was brought a mushroom fillet instead of the Parmesan crusted fillet... i didn't mind but they were awesome and comped my meal and brought out the Parmesan that goes on top so i can have it with the stake they already gave me.(we were in a hurry so i didnt want to wait for another one) A couple of months after that we went again and we had a horrible experience wait for our table/service and food was just horrible. We came there just for dessert and i need to mention that it was not busy at all. we were never asked for our drink order until waiting about 5-10 minutes after we sat down when i asked a manager for assistance. by the time he got our drinks our waitress finally came to ask for our order (she must have been on break as we didn't see her anywhere in the room) then it took what it seemed like forever to get our 4 different types of desserts. By the time we left i was very very disappointed. But i guess the last few times we have been this year we have had great customer service. We will definitely go again."}
{"text":"Great food! My favorite is the Cobb salad with filet, and of course the white chocolate bread pudding! Amazing!!"}
{"text":"I have mixed feelings on this place. This was my second time here but I'm just not in love. I made a reservation for lunch and we were immediately seated. It was little while before someone came over and take our drink order, however this person was just helping out. She took our drink order and told us who our server was going to be. This is when the really long wait started. It was about 8 minutes before our server showed up. That's quite a while when the menus are closed!  We figured he was on a smoke break and when he showed up, clearly he had been!   We started out with fresh guacamole and salsa. Nice fresh warm chips. Pretty good all around!  For my entree I had the filet mignon Cobb salad, substituting ranch dressing for the red wine vinaigrette. My salad arrived and it looked beautiful but I had two complaints about it. The filet mignon was more like overcooked steak cubes and there was way too much blue cheese. I love blue cheese but this was excessive and overpowered the flavor of the salad completely.   My friends seemed to enjoy their bun-less cheeseburger and famous chicken salad entrees. No complaints from them.    Enjoy!"}
{"text":"I enjoyed dinner here. The service here is pretty amazing. Never a moment when you're left looking around for a server. I lucked out and got Josh as my server. He was wonderful. I explained to him that I was just visiting the area and had never been to the White Chocolate Grill. He immediately offered me a complimentary bowl of gin tomato soup. All I can say is - AMAZING! Definitely ask for Josh.  Initially I ordered the Ono with a mango shrimp relish as my main entree. I was over cooked, so I sent it back and opted for the balsamic ribeye. I really enjoyed the flavor but it became tough at the end. Not to worry, I would definitely give this place another try."}
{"text":"It's as yummy as it sounds! I've been known to only order their sides for a meal, they're super delishhhh. The Honey Roasted Carrot are a MUST. If you think you don't like carrots, get that look of disgust off your face long enough to savor this delight.  If you're into burgers (I'm usually not), you must try their BBQ Bacon Burger. Also, if you're looking for recommendations a lot of people swear by the Filet Mignon Cobb Salad."}
{"text":"A wonderful place for dinner in north scottsdale.  Particular highlights include the mayo burger and steak sandwich. Great baked crab cakes, and the most excellent appetizer in maricopa county...the venerable Arizona egg rolls!"}
{"text":"I have been wanting to try this place for a long time. I finally had an opportunity to stop for lunch. I am extremely disappointed. The food was gross and the service was terrible.  I got their famous tomato soup and it was like the opened a can of crushed tomatoes and a can of sliced mushrooms and dumped them in a bowl with a little bit of a bisque base.  Aster waiting another 20 min I finally got the ahi appetizer I ordered and the tuna did not appear fresh and had a grayish/brown color and it was all sitting on top of a soupy slaw pile which was absolutely gross! I am so disappointed after all the good things I had heard.  I don't think this place even deserves a 2nd chance.  gross!!!"}
{"text":"You absolutely must try the tomato gin soup!  There is nothing like it in ANY other restaurant. Food was awesome, I had the New Orleans blackened salmon - a healthy piece with Mardi Gras rice.  Seemed sparse, but left room for the most fabulous white chocolate brownie I have EVER had.    My only complaint?  Our table (for two) was small and cramped.  But great service and great food!"}
{"text":"Alright, it's only fair that I write an updated review for WCG since I have had good experiences there since my grilled cheese sandwich fiasco. I give the place props for being very easy to work with on last minute reservations for big groups. Several times, about 16 or so of my coworkers and I have decided to do a last minute group outing, and they've been able to accommodate us in a pinch. During our group outings, the waiters and waitresses have provided excellent service, making sure everyone in our large group was well set on drinks and such. WCG, you've won me back."}
{"text":"Visiting Scottsdale from Nashville. This place came highly recommended from and friend. It did not disappoint and gives us a great go to. Our server Hayley did a fantastic job. My wife asked a couple questions and her recommendations fit perfectly. I had the filet and my wife had the Salmon New Orleans. Both dishes where great and the drinks we had where delicious. We are only here for couple more days but if can make it back we definitely will."}
{"text":"Read some of the other reviews and can't understand how people give this place more than 3 stars, especially when they had a complaint about the food!  This place was a huge disappointment.  When we arrived, we thought we were in for a treat since the place was packed.  Unfortunately, the food was just mediocre.  Had the spinach/artichoke dip and AZ egg rolls .... nothing special.  In fact, they tasted like your typical \"chain restaurant\" fare.  The entrees were just as uninspiring.  I had the crab cakes and my husband had the trout.  Best way to describe both.. \"meh\".  Here's the kicker though - with a name like The White Chocolate Grill and the desserts listed at the top of the menu, you would expect them to be exceptional. Not! Silky Chocolate Souffle Cake was dry and one dimensional.  The crust on the White Chocolate Banana Cream pie was so think and hard, it was impossible to cut into.  The crust so dominated the dessert that you could barely taste any of the other ingredients.  We're from Chicago and maybe there's just a lack of exposure to good food here, but no way does this place rates even close to 4 stars let alone 5."}
{"text":"Tomato gin soup is a must. Caprese salad was good, but nothing spectacular. Grilled artichoke? Skip it. You can literally make it at home. Cut 1 artichoke in half, throw on grill and brush with olive oil, then dash with Parmesan cheese. Too basic to be $12 but I tried it for the reviews. Also unimpressed by how long I had to wait for my food. I don't think I'll be back."}
{"text":"Peg and I took an out of town guest to the WCC on a typical stay-at home to eat night, Friday, (because of the usual craziness involved on such a popular night). We waited about 25 minutes past our reso time, but the experience was still incredibly good. Lindsey (floor manager) and our server (Hannah) were incredible. In two of the most difficult positions in one of the most difficult professions, these women were stellar. The food was good, served quickly (given the kitchen had to be swamped because of the SRO and wait times) and attitudes were professional. the poke appetizer was fresh and delightfully light, crab cakes moist and flavorful,  AZ eggrolls (traditional egg rolls filled with spicy grilled chicken, corn, black beans and jack cheese. With jalapeño dipping sauce and oven roasted salsa), and traditional prime rib was juicy, cooked perfectly, and very satisfying. They also bent over backwards for our guest who because of illness had unique dietary restrictions and requests. While this place is out of our usual flight path for meals, it was a great experience and one that will be repeated."}
{"text":"After my initial visit long ago, I re-discovered WCG with my Partner in Culinary Crime this summer.  Since then, I think we have tried a little bit of everything - lunch, happy hour, dinner, the Date Night Menu and on one occasion just dessert.  Yes, it is that good.  I update my review specifically to share three outstanding items on their menu that I would be happy to enjoy again and again:  Filet Mignon Cobb Salad - large enough for sharing, it is a very pretty presentation with orderly rows of marinanted filet, mushrooms, blue cheese, crutons, bacon, tomato, avocodo and egg all atop field greens in a red zinfandel vinaigrette.  I prefer it without the egg or avocado, but hey, I'm picky!  Silky Chocolate Soufflé Cake - A warm chocolate soufflé cake topped with with créme Anglaise and whipped cream.  Decadent and delicious - I doubt I could ever get tired of this.  Life is short, eat dessert first!  and my new favorite:  Maytag Burger - WCG grinds all their meat in-house, and this juicy delight is just right!  Each bite is infused with Iowa blue cheese and applewood smoked bacon, and these flavors enhance rather than overpower the beef.  Mmmm... Beef!  WCG now accepts reservations (recommended, it can get crowded) -  which are easily accessible from Yelp!  Reserve, go, eat and be merry!!"}
{"text":"This past Thursday reservations were attempted at 5PM for 5 for a birthday dinner. After a conversation with management, an ordeal at best, they indicated they were over booked but would accommodate us at a booth with a chair at the end. To make a long story short, we were seated with the above stated booth and chair in plain site of two large booths that would have sat 6 but remained empty during our dining experience. The exuse given was lame, something about a new reservation system.....etc blahblahblah. While the food was delicious and service was good there's more to dining and  that includes the ambience and courtesy, both lacking this evening. In light of the failure of management to adapt and overcome a bad management decision to utilize a defective reservation system I reluctantly will not return to WCG."}
{"text":"One of our go-to spots for nice/casual. They have a fair selection of items to choose from and they do not disappoint. On the lone occasion that we have ever not been completely satisfied with our meal, the manager went out of his way to ensure that we were completely satisfied before we left. A great spot for Date Night or a casual dinner."}
{"text":"My hopes for White Chocolate were high, especially upon walking into the place. The decor is very nice, and the staff are attentive  After dining here one word sums it up:  meh.     The waiters do a good job of refilling beverages, but this doesn't make up for the lackluster fare. The spinach dip was so-so (ask for a side of raw veggies to accompany it).   Our entrees were the biggest disappointment. When I asked my waiter what was better, the classic chicken salad or the veggie burger, he said the latter. He wasn't convincing.  I asked about the minted green beans, he responded \"they're not my favorite, but I eat them all the time.\"  Okay...points for honesty.   the most impressive part of the place is the bar.  It's gorgeous.  I could see myself lounging around here for a couple hours, soaking up the atmosphere, enjoying good company...if only food lived up to this standard.  It was a decent experience, nothing to rave about.  Meh."}
{"text":"I have been here several times in the past and was always pleased.  Went for lunch yesterday and was not so pleased, here's why:  Our server was not on top of things, he did not fully explain the special, only noticed this when I overheard another waitress describing it.  I ordered the Blackened fish sandwich(mahi-mahi) (see pics) I chose to have the Vegetable of the day which he told me was roasted spaghetti squash.  The fish itself was very good, the sauce however had a weird herb or spice that just didn't sit right with me and the squash was riddled with raisins and pistachios (that would have been nice to know beforehand) it was also barely warm.   My husband ordered the Balsamic Rib-eye with mashed potatoes (see pics) I tasted it it had a great flavor and he loved it! The mashed potatoes however were lukewarm at best.......sigh........ I ate the tomatoes that came on his plate and they were the best part of the meal, so sweet and juicy drizzled with balsamic Yum!  We  Finally got a refill on our soda when we had only a few bites of food left! Our little waiter was too busy pretending to be cool holding up the bar.  There is nothing worse than food that is not hot, except not having anything to drink while eating!!  They are only getting 3 stars now because I KNOW they can be quite good.  Hope you make it up to me WCG!!"}
{"text":"terrible experience,unfriendly staff, low quality food, such a waist of time and money."}
{"text":"I've really enjoyed WCG for both biz and personal dining.  The service has always been outstanding as well as the food...but today was an anomaly.  We went during the lunch hour on Friday, and were seated in the bar area...the only downside was the 5 table group adjacent to us celebrating some business milestone - not a big deal.    However, mgmt must have been unprepared as our server took much too long at 1135am to get the job done.  They were obviously understaffed for the day...it was busy - a good thing.    Wife had a shrimp salad, daughter - the enchiladas or burritos - and I chose the (yikes) Mahi Mahi with Crab.  Wife and daughter immediately remarked, when we were served, \"something smells weird\".  I have the constitution of a marine...so was 100% unaffected..until about 5 minutes after we left and went to BBB across the parking lot.  I've never been so ill from food in my life.  I spent the entire afternoon in the restroom and am still paranoid about solid foods.  The worst part is I mentioned this to someone at my golf club and learned their husband went thru the same thing a couple of weeks ago - same dish, same location.    Bottom line:  loved WCG, but, unfortunately, will never go back.  Great service, toxic food.  Sorry guys.  Really loved you up til now, but I'm too busy to be sick from lunch."}
{"text":"We met a friend for early dinner and drinks. The server was nice but the food was terrible. We ordered chips and guacamole for $9and there was less than half cup of guacamole and a plateful of thin generic chips.  I said something about the portion size being so small and the reply was it is supposed to be a ''cup'' of guacamole. More like 3 tablespoons.   We ordered the quinoa burger with side of steamed broccoli for dinner. The burger was ok, but the broccoli? They added some horrible seasoning which was salty and frankly ruined the taste. To be fair we did sit at the table a long time with our friend, so we tipped generously but sure wouldn't recommend and would never go back.  Very disappointed."}
{"text":"This restaurant is top notch. Great food, the Crispy Chicken Salad is to die for, and the service is really good. Very attentive restaurant staff."}
{"text":"We ate dinner here last night in our waiter Sean was very attentive. My wife has an allergy and he made sure to check with the chef with all of our questions and we felt Very comfortable with all of their knowledge and concern for their customers. The food was delicious and the service was great and I would recommend."}
{"text":"Great food and service. Perfect place to celebrate special occasion. Make a reservation!"}
{"text":"Food was decent, too pricy for its taste. Busy and loud environment, definitely not a place for a nice romantic dinner."}
{"text":"Much busier than the last time we visited Phoenix a couple of years back.  The place seems quite popular now.  The food was very good as were the desserts."}
{"text":"I love their dessert! It's my favorite thing to eat here. The best one is the freshly baked apple pie. Besides the dessert, their burgers and sandwiches are great too.   Food 4/5 Service 4/5 Atmosphere 3/5- it's really dark inside, I wish it was brighter"}
{"text":"Had lunch at this place on Friday with a friend, but I think this place is good for dinner because the way they set-up the light fixtures and the ambiance. The bar was kind of cool.  I had soup of the day which was chicken thai curry soup with mushroom and field green salad with goat cheese topping.  The soup was beyond salty, but the salad was delicious! At this restaurant everything is in huge portion, so if you are not big eater I suggest to share."}
{"text":"Great salads.  Went there for the first time yesterday and I had the salmon salad.  It was delicious!"}
{"text":"Everything I've eaten here is wonderful.. The steak salad, pulled pork sandwich and of course the bread pudding"}
{"text":"We had high hopes when we walked in when the place was mobbed but the food was not very good. I will say the hostess was friendly and the waitress was fantastic but the grilled stuffed artichokes were under cooked, my burger left me unsatisfied, and my husband's crispy chicken salad was incredibly salty.  I gave the stars I did because everyone that worked there were super friendly, fast and helpful."}
{"text":"I love this place because it reminds me of Houston's! Rumor has it that the owner of WCG use to be a manger at Houston's but quit and opened this place.   The food is pretty good but a little on the bland side. I ordered the blackened sea bass and I had to add quite a bit of salt to make it flavorful!  I know we are in the desert, but the fish tasted frozen, not fresh,! Ugh!!! I do enjoy the ambiance but they need to season their food, for God's sake!! I'm waiting on my bread pudding so I hope that it better!  Update...the bread pudding was wonderful and the bartender took the sea bass off my bill! Great service!!!!!!"}
{"text":"The food was delicious but it too over an hour to get our food. They realized they were out of one of the entrees at least half an hour after we ordered. Steals were delicious but definitely screwed up big time"}
{"text":"This has been bookmarked since last year when it was recommended to me by my boss! Finally, a date night was set aside to try it out and it did not disappoint.   Chandler was our waiter and was professional and helpful the entire dinner. We let him know it was our first time in and he provided suggestions for each part of the menu.   We ended up with spinach artichoke dip for an appetizer, a filet mignon sand which, and the filet salad for entrees. We ended with the blondie brownie.   The steak on both the sand which and salad was amazing! So tender and flavorful. My only regret was getting the brownie. I expected a fluffy brownie but it was dense and thick and the most prominent flavor was butter. I was also hoping the brownie would be warmed up, but it was hard and cold. The food was exceptional but the dessert was a disappointment."}
{"text":"My husband and I were in town and took the recommendation of friends to eat at White Chocolate. The environment was good, not too loud and perfect for an evening out. Following the suggestion of our waitress, we had the dinner fish, grouper and the bread pudding for desert. I definitely recommend this restaurant, great food, ambiance and excellent service from Savanna. Will come back for sure!"}
{"text":"AMAZING!!  My husband and I are obsessed.  I always order the ribs and roasted chicken with mashed potatoes.  Ribs fall right off the bone, and the chicken is fabulous!  I would recommend this to anyone who loves effecient service, great food, and a nice atmosphere."}
{"text":"WCG is my go-to lunch date venue with friends and guests.  Always enjoy a delicious meal and the customer service never disappoints.  For lunch or dinner, you can't go wrong.  Great atmosphere, great food, great value."}
{"text":"I've been wanting to try this restaurant for a while and I remember it every time Restaurant Week rolls around. Finally planned a dinner here and it became a family affair. I made a reservation online and it was easy and convenient, with an email confirmation. We came a few min before our time and they let us know the table had paid and they were just waiting for them to leave, which took about 10 min. The place was pretty busy and all the tables looked occupied.   We were seated in a larger booth and it was cozy and dark. Our server Josh was great and attentive, always refilling our waters and asking if we needed anything before we could ask. We ordered from the Restaurant Week menu so we got two starters, the double dip (queso, guacamole and salsa with chips) and egg rolls. Everyone seemed to enjoy them. The entrees were great as well, I got the Salmon New Orleans with spicy shrimp and also tried from the blackened mahi and Idaho trout. Loved the crab butter sauce and each dish was cooked well.  Dessert came out last and the white chocolate brownie was divine. I'm not a fan of white chocolate but I like that it wasn't too sweet. It had chocolate sauce and Belgian chocolate bits inside topped with ice cream and white chocolate. The chocolate soufflé cake was very rich along with a condensed milk sauce, none of us could eat more than a few bites.   Overall I was pleased with the food and the service here and would come back to check out other menu items. I'm glad I got to try it!"}
{"text":"Expect  it to be busy and fairly loud when you go. The noise level was not as bad in the seating around the corner to the left, from the entrance.   Service: Service was top notch. We did not need for anything that night and the waitress was genuine and a professional. Drinks: The Mojito was disappointing. It was not the quality I would expect. Food:  The Prime Rib French Dip  was very good. The dip was not greasy and neither was meat, of which I appreciated. Dessert: Chocolate Soufflé Cake was very good.   TLDR:  Order the Prime Rib French Dip for a good sandwich. Service is very good here.  You can't go wrong with the Chocolate Soufflé Cake."}
{"text":"I came here a few weeks ago with my sister and soon to be husband and this place is very Arizona.  It looked like pretty much any other upscale chain restaurant in the area and it didn't really have any personality of its own. Don't get me wrong, I have nothing against chains or the decor of this place, but it was just uninspriring.  I had the ribs and they were tender and the meat fell of the bone. I love when restaurants smoke/steam their ribs. We also had an ahi tuna appetizer which was on point. I was a little disappointed with their deserts though. I mean with a name like White Chocolate grill you would think they would represent on the desert category but alas they did not. The white chocolate brownie was way too sweet."}
{"text":"We went for the first time with my family and couple of girl friends on a Saturday night. I have read great reviews so we decided to give it a try. We did not get a reservation and just walked in around 9pm hoping that we'd get a table right away since they are an hour away from closing time. Parking wasn't bad, location was easy to find, and the restaurant's ambiance was relaxing and I would say it's more for \"date night\" kind of restaurant instead of a family style restaurant. We were surprised that it took 20 minutes to get us a table because the restaurant didn't look so packed at all.   When we finally got our table, our server was trying hard to be polite but he gave us a vibe that he was tired and ready to go home which I totally understand.   We ordered different entrees to give each a try, I ordered the black seasoned Mahi with fresh mashed potatoes and I thought that was delicious. My boyfriend ordered the chicken enchiladas which he also enjoyed. We also tried the roasted chicken and bbq ribs and thought those were a little dry and not as savory than expected. And finally, my sister ordered a cheeseburger with a side of french fries which she also thought was \"okay\" and nothing special about it.   Each dish costs about $18-24 which makes me think the food would be extravagant and something that I have never tasted anywhere else before but I think for this price range, it did not meet my expectation.  Overall I think we had an \"okay\" experience but no really looking forward to going back."}
{"text":"My husband brought me here to celebrate our 17th wedding anniversary.  Not only were the food and drinks excellent, but the service was outstanding.  Our server, Anthony, took the time to check our reservations and noted that we were celebrating an anniversary.  He went out of his way to make our experience there special.  We were so impressed!"}
{"text":"Wow! Everything was amazing! I got the salmon and the carrots. Wow! I can't believe how good just the carrots were! Hubby got the balsamic ribeye. Crazy good! Even the kids meals were amazing. The cheeseburger was thick and juicy. The ribs were tasty. Our server was wonderful. Very friendly, really chatted it up with my kids. The place looked very inviting. We will definitely be back soon!"}
{"text":"I've eaten here with gusto it was so good.  Can't remember what I had a year ago, but I had a Maytag blue cheese burger (which was so melted on the burger I actually asked where the cheese was, but you sure could taste it..yum!) and it was superb!  Came with a big whopping hunk of homemade cut fries--which I certainly didn't need but loved scarfing down like a hog!  Just fabulous quality of food here. Their meat--and I mean the hamburger quality--is excellent, too, for what America offers (nothing compares to the beef in Argentina where I just returned from). Love this place so much told the son to take a date there if he wants to impress her with good food.  Atmosphere is nice, service was great, just love this place! One of my very fav places to eat here in Phoenix for sure under $20 each!  Yummy delicious food here!!!"}
{"text":"Delicious!  Had to wait awhile to get in but it was worth the wait. Will definitely be back :)"}
{"text":"Dining at this popular, been around a while eatery is never disappointing.  The staff is well trained and the food always spot on.  We enjoy the bar area for a more intimate, casual experience.  Convenient location near grocery, theater, sport stores and more."}
{"text":"Enjoyed a nice Sunday afternoon Lunch here. There were 4 adults and 1 child. They have a great children's menu with several good choices. The regular menu is fully loaded with lots of entrees including Salads, Sandwiches, Steaks, Ribs, Seafood, and. Chicken. My chicken had come out cold, so the waitress immediately took it back. Within minutes I had a HOT very good chicken. The waitress and manager voluntarily offered us a free desert, which was very classy and professional in many ways. The Deserts they offer are amazing. We had the brownie and apple pie. It was AWESOME!! Highly recommend this place for the food, service, and a well managed establishment. You can tell they really care about the customer.."}
{"text":"Loved this place and would go again!  Ambiance, delicious bread pudding dessert, service.  Our entire experience was wonderful.  There was a hiccup with one of our meals but they took care of it right away.  We were pleased with the results and how accommodating they were."}
{"text":"came here after playing tpc scottsdale. My dad got a chicken sandwich and loved it. We had the az. egg rolls, ive had  these before somewhere but dont remember where. I ordered the wcg cheeseburger and it was great. I tried finishing it but ate to many egg rolls and way to many glasses of fresh squezzed lemonade that was great also. I kept trying to finish the burger because it was so good but just couldnt and i still had to leave room for the white chocolate bannana cream pie. that was great to but i only wish it had more white chocolate."}
{"text":"The name is completely deceiving.    When my friend mentioned this spot as a place to have dinner at,  I imagined a chocolate fondue place with a chocolate waterfall to greet me at the entrance to the restaurant (don't ask me why about the waterfall).  The best way to describe the decor and the type of food served at The White Chocolate Grill is...if the Cheesecake Factory and Houston's gave birth to a baby restaurant.   I ordered the balsamic ribeye with a side of couscous. My friend ordered the trout with a side of couscous.   In a nutshell, our server was efficient :) the food was good :)  the decor was nice :) but there wasn't any cascading chocolate waterfall at the entrance to the restaurant :("}
{"text":"Fabulous service!  We went for dinner after a long weekend of relay running and camping, and were treated like royalty by Swazy.  She kept our meal moving and our drinks refreshed.  Our salads were cool & crisp.  Dressings tasted fresh house-made.   The steaks arrived at the perfect temperature per our orders.  We were so full that dessert wasn't an option, but the did have several tempting options.  We'd made a reservation, so our wait for a table was minimal.  In the front courtyard, there is ample seating to wait and sit by the fire and converse. Parking was plentiful, free and close to the restaurant."}
{"text":"We went back and had a great time and the food and staff were amazing! They are back on their A game!"}
{"text":"First time here, nice environment maybe a little dated. My dining companions already seated with drinks, took the waiter a long time to come over to take my drink order and after waiting another extended amount of time, he returns saying no we don't have that beer. Order something else and again unusually long wait time. Finally we decide to order; food arrives much more timely than my drink. Crab cakes were excellent but the brussel sprouts I anticipated eating were not actual individual sprouts but a cole slaw version-I do not like cole slaw and if that was made clear on menu, I would have never ordered them. Another odd thing, while eating dinner, waiter drops off dessert menu? The worse thing was the check process: no dessert here is check-dropped off by unknown staff, he returns, we ask can you split? Yes will be back with reader. Reader? Another staff comes over grabs the  check with our cards and says split and takes off; then our waiter comes over with a card reader and starts to scold us about us saying split check with other staff and that is not what we said??seriously? So then he proceeds to process our cards at the table?!? Standing there while we input the tip and not providing any direction. This was a shock, for a restaurant trying to convey a higher level of dining this was like being at fast food restaurant. I don't know if the waiter was new, but he clearly lacked the people skills for a waiter and this card reader at the table process-lose that process to bring the  restaurant up to a more appropriate level dining experience-you can charge $30+ for meals and provide fast food service and purchase. It is unlikely I would return"}
{"text":"This is a great place for birthdays and date nights! It's busy and LOUD so make a reservation and be patient.  I love their Jambalaya and the prime rib.  The fish sandwich is good for lunch Of course, you've got to get something with white chocolate in it for dessert!"}
{"text":"We love WCG, it's our old standby. Always consistent, good food. The desserts (obviously) are insanely good. The bread pudding is the best I have ever had. My husband usually gets the ribs, he loves them and I've gotten the chicken fingers (so good), SW egg rolls, chicken madera (so good) and the WCG salad which I love. It's a nice atmosphere, low lights and very clean. They have happy hour in the bar area with a special menu, not sure what time it starts, but it ends at 6PM."}
{"text":"Well it was very busy on a Wednesday, but we had reservations so we did not wait long. It was a little too dark for me and a little too loud. Which was a problem with the very soft spoken waiter, but no matter how many times you asked him to repeat himself, he didn't get the point of raising his voice at all.  Then there is the food, pretty good, BUT when I am paying $25-$30 for a plate, I would actually like to have some food on it!  These portions were so small it was laughable. It was my husband's birthday and I felt terrible when I saw his plate because he is a big eater. Also, you only get one side, first place I've been too that doesn't come with two sides and no freaking salads either. Anyway when we got home, after spending almost $200, my husband had to make himself another plate of food to be satisfied.  Unfortunately the side portions were very skimpy, not even probably a half cup portion!  I had the crab cakes, which weren't bad, but I would really not call them an actual \"cake\", you actually think of something puck sized and these were two pitiful dollops of crab. My son made out the best, he had the cheapest plate and got the most food! Burger and fries!  I am for certain never wasting my money here again. When I spend that much money on dinner, I want to leave satisfied and we definitely were not'"}
{"text":"After having several people talking about this restaurant, we tried it one night.  A very nice looking restaurant inside and the service was OK, but the food just was so-so.  Nothing special.  We don't know what all the hype is about.  Maybe we didn't order the right food or something but we were not impressed. But looking at the crowd, i don't think they will miss us not going there in the future."}
{"text":"I had an amazing experience last night! Exceeded any expectation I had!   I am familiar with this area, I frequently go to the Whole Foods and Oh Ya K BBQ. For some reason I've never been to White Chocolate Grill but I can definitely say I've been missing out.   We had a 6pm reservation and when we walked in the place was packed! The poor hostesses were running around and getting assistance from their managers. People were standing in the lobby area and I was thinking to myself \"this isn't going to be good, they're so busy.\" I was wrong.  We were sat in a spacious booth and someone took our drink order. Soon after, our server Taylor introduced herself to us and let us know about ingredients and specials going on this evening. She gave us recommendations on what we may like based off what we told her we were looking for. She was friendly and made us feel welcome.   For appetizers we had their gin tomato soup and chicken tortilla soup. Both were very good, but one bowl is good for two people.  Then for our entrees they were better than anything we could have expected. I have photos attached. The scallops are what I had and they're to die for ! I would go back in a heartbeat for them!  Also, we ordered gin martinis and they have bleu cheese stuffed olives. Another cool thing was Taylor kept coming back with frozen glasses and pouring the martini into the cold glass in order to keep the martini chilled. I was so impressed!!  We had the white chocolate brownie for dessert and boy it was amazing. One of the best desserts I've ever had in my whole life.  If you're looking for a dining experience that is flawless from start to finish then come here. They were slammed and still delivered amazing service and got everything out to us in a timely manner.   The staff was great! Every single person who assisted us (the food runners and everyone who helped refresh our waters and Taylor) were so professional and nice. The managers were helping their staff and everything seemed to be running really well. Food was coming out in a timely manner and the kitchen was busy but everything still looked beautiful. I used to work in the industry and I know it's not easy when you're a full house and people are waiting in front of the hostess stand. Hats off to everyone working!!  I will recommend this place to everyone I know and I will most definitely come back!"}
{"text":"I love it here. I'm visiting Scottsdale from Chicago (my home).   The waiter: (Kendall) Very friendly and attentive. I never had to wait to get something. When I told him I was allergic to raw unions he remembered and every single thing that had onions in it (to the gravy), he let me know. That was very considerate.   The food: Great. I had a sandwich and it was amazing. Especially considering the food at our hotel (Fairmont) was average at best. I also had the white chocolate brownie and let me tell you...it was the best I've ever had. Soooooo rich   The ambiance: Very nice. Thankfully, it was not too cold. Laid back and very clean.   Overall, I would definitely visit again."}
{"text":"I went here with some friends over the weekend and a good time was had by all.  We sat in a great booth/chair combo table and the atmosphere was comfortable without being too pretentious.  Too bad I can't say them same about most of the patrons.  We didn't hang out in the bar, but it's a pretty amazing setup.  The food was delicious, but nothing over the top.  Their desserts are their real money makers.  There were four of us and we each decided to order one and share them.  Banana Cream Pie - Yum.  White Chocolate Brownie - Double Yum.  White Chocolate Raspberry Cheesecake - Cheesecake Factory who?  Apple Pie - Fab take on an old favorite!  They are very large though, so one is enough for two folks to share!  They had a favorite wine of my friend's which is not all that common - a definite plus!  I would go here again, but I wouldn't go out of my way to do so."}
{"text":"From the moment I walked into this place, I knew I was going to enjoy it.  I cannot explain why I liked the atmosphere, but it had a fun classy feel to it. A little dark, but still has a cool vibe.   My girlfriend and I arrived a few minutes before the other couple we were dining with showed up.  We were still seated right away, and we spent the whole time looking over the menu.  I could have ordered anything on it!  Everything sounded spectacular.   The group decided to start with grilled artichokes as an appetizer.  After a very short wait two good sized artichokes, with some parmesan on them, and a really good dipping sauce arrived.  Then our meals arrived at what felt like the perfect amount of time later.  We had citrus soy glazed salmon, which was probably the best salmon I've had at a place that doesn't just specialize in sea food. The fish was cooked perfectly and the sauce was sweet, but not overpowering.  We also tried what looked one of the most unique dishes on the menu.  Rotisserie chicken crepes.  It was covered in a mushroom and Madeira sauce.  Very different, and very good.  Most of their entrees come with some really good sides.  We had the honey roasted carrots (Delicious.  I was told these were good and they did not disappoint), and Israeli couscous (also delicious).   The big kicker was the dessert.  The place is called The While Chocolate Grill, so the dessert has to be good!  The table all split the french white chocolate bread pudding.  I cannot explain how great this was. Bread pudding made from croissants, topped with white chocolate, caramel, and cream. It was irresistible!   The prices were good, and the meal was worth every penny.  There's so much more on this menu that I want to try, so I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Great service and the food is always great! Great place for date night too. Good atmosphere. Lightly lit. Awesome gluten free chocolate soufflé too, so save some room for dessert."}
{"text":"Best happy hour and great food!! Love the chicken tenders, burger sliders, ribs and southern fried chicken salad!!"}
{"text":"Cool place with a nice outdoor patio area.  They have a nice selection of whiskeys.  The food and drink are also priced nicely.  Everything is affordable.  For my meal I ordered the blue cheese crusted filet.  Instead of mashed potatoes I requested their fresh cut fries.  The steak came prepared as requested, medium rare.  That is always a good start.  The steak was seasoned well and tasty.  My only issue is it was very small.  It might have been 6oz., no more, possibly less.  It was smothered in Maytag blue cheese.  The fries were also solid.  They were shoestring, not my favorite but good for eating with steak."}
{"text":"The Miami Beach SHRIMP salad used to the the BEST salad in Scottsdale(huge poached shrimp)....They are now using small grilled TASTELESS shrimp(yuck) and they have destroyed my favorite salad.... White Chocolate Grill...what were you thinking??? If cost is an issue...use fewer of the large shrimp...but don't ruin an exceptional salad(I would NEVER  eat it the new way ever again).  I actually had to send my salad back(I never would have imagined that happening)"}
{"text":"Fun restaurant for lunch or dinner, we went for early dinner and had a 35 minute wait.  We sat outside around the firepit then went into the bar and waited for a first come seat in the lower area.  Started out with ribs, fabulous, egg rolls, fabulous and spinach/artichoke dip, fabulous.  Tomato gin soup recommended on Yelp was fabulous as stated.  I had the crab cakes, they were not the best I have had,but not the worst.  Hubby had the Ahi tuna salad and like it.  Great place for parties, meeting with friends are just having a date night.  Will definately be back"}
{"text":"Bad service. We went at 2:30, place was not busy. The food was average, don't go out of your way to eat at this place. Glass of wine was nice, but pricey. The manager didn't seem to have a handle what was going on."}
{"text":"We came here for our last night in Arizona, following the recommendation of a guest from our resort. We really wanted to dine here and we even looked at the menu online before going but our experience was \"meh\"... The food isn't really, really good, but if you are hungry, it's ok. The starters are to share indeed. We had the Four Cheese Spinach & Artichoke dip that it can be probably for 3 persons. The tortilla chips tasted a bit old but the dip was yummy. Then we had the Balsamic Ribeye and asked well done but some parts of the meat were still red. It comes with a delicious mashed potatoes and red big tomatoes. I chose steam broccoli for a side and was good. They have kid's menu and my daughter chose a burger with no cheese and fries. Although it came with cheese, the server immediately took care of the situation and soon the manager came with a new one and he apologized (It was a good customer service). Regarding the ambience it is very noisy, but may be you don't care about that. We went on a Thursday night and didn't need to make a reservation. There's plenty of space in the parking lot."}
{"text":"Amazing Prime Rob French Dip! Not to mention the burgers, fish, and steamed carrots. White Chocolate has the taste, the quality of atmosphere and reasonable prices. This is one of my favorite restaurants in the area!"}
{"text":"Great food and a great atmosphere!  I have been celiac for about a year now and TWCG has a great gluten-free menu too!    Love it!  Dr. Michael L. Johnson"}
{"text":"While some friends and I were looking for a place to eat before our movie at Scottsdale 101 we decided to try White Chocolate Grill. This restaurant has a very sleek modern look and the inside is very dark as if trying to create more intimacy at the tables. The menu offers mostly sandwiches, burgers,  various meats, and some salads. I was not in the mood for meat, but was to hungry for a salad so this put me in a bit of a dilemma. Finally I decided to order the club sandwich with a side choice of steamed broccoli. The broccoli was actually my favorite thing I ordered. It was steamed perfectly and sprinkled with what I believe was Parmesan cheese and some sort of red pepper. It was really delicious! My sandwich was really good as well, but I thought it was a little pricey. Later we followed our meal with a molten chocolate souffl. The souffl was amazing and came out with a layer of white chocolate around it. There were many other white chocolate dessert items going along with the restaurants name such as a white chocolate brownie. I also had a taste of their white chocolate raspberry cheesecake, but it was a bit to tart for my liking. The restaurant was a bit fancier and pricier then what I was expecting, and although the atmosphere was very nice, there was not enough items on the menu that I was interested in to go back soon."}
{"text":"I believe I have reviewed this place in the past but its one of our favorite restaurants in the valley. My personal favorite is the parm crusted fillet. I love it! It comes on a bed of mash so don't order mash!! Order carrots or a different side than mash.   Anyways you cat got wrong with anything you order from WCG. The food has never disappointed me or my Wife. We didn't try desert this last time but love apple pie in the past. Please try the Apple Pie...it takes a little while to bal but out of all of the deserts this was our favorite!"}
{"text":"Greeted by hostess right away . Low light inside but not too low . Comfortable seating and you can see the kitchen. Wait staff extremely attentive and very pleasant.   Artichoke appetizer - cooked perfectly with a generous amount of aioli sauce .   Totally forgot about ordering the tomato soup but I heard from the table next to us it was outstanding! Next time ...  Miami Beach shrimp salad - big portion , every bit of fantastic. The champagne vinaigrette dressing was a great addition.   Sirloin Cobb salad  - huge and delicious. Every bit of the salad complemented the other . It has a red Zinfandel vinaigrette- I wasn't sure of it until I tasted it . It enhanced all of the flavors perfectly.   A lot of attention to detail in this establishment- it really can be the simple things that make it . In with the sweeteners there was a small piece of cardboard just to dispose of gum . The Arnold Palmer I ordered had just a hint of sugar on the rim of the glass .   The WCG would be a great place for a business meeting , social time or anything else . Definitely will return !"}
{"text":"I went for happy hour in the bar and it was great! It was so busy, but the server was able to still be really nice and get us everything we needed. We had the chicken egg rolls on the happy hour and they were so good! We also got the banana cream pie, it was so amazing! It melted in your mouth! I cannot wait to go back!"}
{"text":"came here for lunch the other day and finally had there WCG cheese burger and OMG was it flipping awesome.  Dont wast your time with the Maytag burger and you must try the WCG at least once in your life.  GET IT DONE!"}
{"text":"The Mignon Benedict was good but not great. The banana, strawberry and raspberry side had just the right flavors to complement but the banana was trimmed poorly (the unattractive end with the stem attached, was in my bowl).  All the staff seems to need more training in guest service. The bill was placed on our table when we were half finished with the meal. This is not a diner! The waiter shoved plates at us, rather than placing them. The bread pudding is fantastic.  I'll be back for the pudding and I'll hope there will have been some training."}
{"text":"Very enjoyable. The BBQ Bacon Cheeseburger is awesome and tastes a lot more sophisticated than its name suggests. Ribs are amazing too. My Dad has a hankering for their blue cheese martini which sounds odd, and is, but he says they're good."}
{"text":"I'm mainly giving my experience 3 stars based on the service. We came here a few days before NYE, there were 5 of us for dinner. Our waitress was very awkward and would come to our table and just stand there and stare at us and wait for us to speak to her first. She was very abrupt and interrupted the conversation multiple times trying to pick up the check, which we were not ready to pay as we were still enjoying the conversations at our table (we were in no way just sitting at the table for a long amount of time or anything). The other servers that brought out our food/ cleared our dishes etc were much friendlier and polite. We actually had to ask our waitress to clear our salad plates after they sat for a while once we were clearly finished. We love White Chocolate Grill and have been coming here for years, but we notice that the service has been on the decline. I have visited the other WCG locations as I have been fortunate enough to live by all 3 over the past years so I am familiar with the quality of service that is usually provided. The food was on point though, but as my father in law said, if the food is good but service is mediocre he's not as likely to return...just saying..."}
{"text":"This review is purely for the Banana Cream Pie.....as I am from Australia I had never had Banana Cream Pie....so my husband ( who had a major craving for one)...phoned around some restaurants to find where they served them....The White Chocolate Grill delivered!...It was awesome and made on site. Our waiter was very friendly and didn't mind that we were taking up a table in a very full restaurant just to share a piece of pie. The atmosphere was very nice too and next time we will go before we eat dinner and order a little more! The menu looks very good."}
{"text":"My mom and I went twice in one day! It is soo good. First we got the az eggrolls, mashed potatoes with good gravy, summer corn salad, and the banana cream pie. Everything was fantastic!! The jalapeño cream sauce that comes with the eggrolls goes with it perfectly.   That night we went back for the bread pudding which I will dream about it is that good!"}
{"text":"My go-to restaurant!  Food is consistently excellent and the servers are pros (know the menu, friendly but not overbearing, pay attention).  Ambiance is that of a chic low-lit club (love the lighted & dramatic back-bar) and the noise level is tolerable (sit on the \"upper level\" next to the hostess stand if you want quiet conversation). Great ribs, beef, fish, salads, appetizers.  Don't love the desserts, but I can do without, LOL.  Nice patio too.  Only drawback is the very long (up to 1.5 hours) wait during \"season\", and the often-clueless hostesses.  Have brought many friends here and they all love WCG!"}
{"text":"The food was delicious. I ordered the $33 filet. It was cooked perfectly. My wife had the Salmon salad. She enjoyed it. I had a $6 beer to enjoy with my dinner. We shared the raspberry cheesecake and it was enjoyable.   Simply put, I received the bill, and after the taxes it read, \"p206, %1.4= 0.99. My first thoughts are, whats this. I googled it and found nothing relevant about it.  So I asked the waiter. Apparently the owner of this restaurant decided to add a %1.4 fee to every check due to the minimum wage increases.    As a small business owner I find this appalling. I just spent $72 for dinner at your restaurant and tipped your waiter $13. But you feel the need to impose an unnecessary $1 fee to your customers  that more than likely are above and beyond the wage increase."}
{"text":"This place has such a wonderful ambience. You walk in from the heat & are met with cool, low lit dining. If you order a martini, they bring you a new chilled glass half way through. My favorite is the ribs that just fall off the bone!"}
{"text":"This place was a rare find!  Yes it's been there for a while, but I never see it when hitting the Harkins for some R & R.  My girlfriend and I were looking to have sushi at that place down the parking lot, but they weren't open yet. So we said \"hey let's try this place\" and walked into WCG.  First thoughts.. \"ok this looks kinda nice and fancy\"   The hostess was really nice and sat us quickly.  The waiter came over and got us drinks pretty fast and was also really nice and helpful.   Looking over the menu I wanted something light but also something that i was familiar with, so I went with a simple club sandwich.    Let me tell you history with club sandwiches for a moment. Every time I have one at other places, they are always the same.  One sandwich, cut into different triangles, stacked 5\" tall with a tooth pic in each slice.  That's fine.  Many places are also dry.  How does WCG do it?  They use one whole sandwich, stack it high with FRESH ingredients, slice it ONCE in half and it also comes with a nice side sauce (forgot the kind).  I also got a side of fries with it. I don't think in the history of having club sandwiches, have I ever verbally made a noise when eating a sandwich.  My girlfriend even commented to me \"Enjoying your food?\"    It was THE best club I've had.    She got a spicy chicken sandwich that she really enjoyed too!    Then we actually got dessert.  We had their cheesecake and it was the best we've had.  Yes.. better than Cheesecake Factory.  We've been here twice now and it's now a favorite of ours."}
{"text":"Hubby's been wanting to go here for a while, so we decided to check it out.  The restaurant was really nice and the seating is comfortable.  I have to say, the service was great, and the food should've been delicious.    The caprese salad is awesome...the best thing we had tonight.  Other than that, everything else was okay.  The prime rib was lukewarm when we got it, and was cold by the second bite.  It was tasty, but would've been much better if it was hot.  The honey carrots are really good, but they were cold, too.  Our desserts weren't bad.  I got the chocolate souffle cake, which was quite tasty and actually the warmest thing I ate tonight.  Hubby got bread pudding, and it seemed like it should've been hot, but it was ice cold.  We were also surprised that no bread was served before our meal.  No one else seemed to have bread on their table, so I guess it's not something they do...oh well."}
{"text":"Rude managers but great wait staff, especially the waiter Sean.   The steak sandwich is a go to that will never disappoint and the burgers here are better than the ones at other restaurants of this caliber.   The crab cakes are extremely overrated. I'm from Boston and know crab cakes. These are nowhere near as good as the worst ones you'd get in Boston but they claim to be world famous at White Chocolate."}
{"text":"We love WCG food and service. This is one of our favorite restaurants in Scottsdale. We have ordered lots of different entrees and they never disappoint. Steaks and seafood are excellent. Their signature white chocolate bread pudding and chocolate soufflé desserts are so yummy that they are worth the extra calories."}
{"text":"I love White Chocolate grill.  I'd love it more if they took reservations so I didn't always have to wait an hour for a table, but it's worth it.    I have been here quite a few times and both the service and food have always been excellent.  In fact, I've never had a bad meal here.  They have a diverse menu so there is something for everyone.  I have tried their ribs, salads, fish and steak and they've all been delicious.  They have a fun drink menu too.    If you are looking for a good meal, attentive service and a nice setting, you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"While in Scottsdale recently we got hungry. We happened to drive by a little shopping center that had a bunch of places to eat and one was the White Chocolate Grille. We looked up their menu on our iphone and it looked good so we decided to give it a shot.   While waiting for our table we heard a couple leave saying \"delicious!\" and \"that was SO good!\" so we had our hopes pretty high. Once we were seated our drinks were refilled quickly and frequently and our order came out in about 10-15 minutes which I thought was pretty good for how busy it was (a Friday night).   The only downside to our meal was that I received the wrong sandwhich and it took another 10-15 minutes to get the correct one and by now my wife was almost done with her meal.  When the correct sandwhich finally came, holy smokes it was good.  If we're ever in Scottsdale again or if we ever see another White Chocolate Grille we'll 100% eat there again.   For dessert we decide to try the first thing on the menu, the white chocolate brownie. It was good but nothing amazing. Personally I felt there was too much brownie and chocolate sauce and not enough ice cream and whip cream to balance it out. In the future I'd definitely eat there again but I'd probably just go someplace else for dessert."}
{"text":"This is a great restaurant, the food is amazing. I had the club sandwich and was not disappointed. This was the second time I had been there and will definitely continue to come back. The drink selection is just okay, they could add a few more speciality drinks but the food is great!"}
{"text":"The whole staff needs to be replaced. Terrible customer service. There are many restaurants that can offer both great food and service together. Save your time and money."}
{"text":"I've had several bad experiences here.  While I've really enjoy the food they serve, that was the end of the good experience.  The staff is rude and for all the attitude they still messed up their jobs.  I'd rather go anyplace else.  Thanks!"}
{"text":"Came here last night right as happy hour was ending. We didn't have a reservation and the wait was 30 minutes which isn't bad on a Friday night! We were planning on waiting, but then walked over to the bar which was super cozy and relaxed. We found two seats immediately and were greeted by really friendly bartenders. I am so glad we sat here! Not only was our service super fast, but the food was so good. I ordered the spinach and kale salad add avo and couscous (a side of their couscous is 4 something .. which was a little obnoxious) it really was amazing tho. I would totally get it again.  My hubby ordered the ribs on happy hour and they were pretty perfect... the best part was the dessert. I am usually not a fan of bread pudding at all, but white chocolate grill uses croissants as their base. It was so so good like some of the best I have ever had.  We will totally be back and will probably sit at the bar again (we even met a great couple next to us who were so sweet!) great spot!"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I dined here this Tuesday evening and all I can say is WOW!!  The food was amazing, our server Savanna suggested the balsamic marinated ribeye for him and the scallops for me, and I was extremely pleased. Absolutely delicious.  After our entrees, she suggested her favorite dessert the white chocolate bread pudding, and it definitely was a perfect ending to a perfect night.   Food, service, ambiance, all phenomenal. Can't wait to come back soon."}
{"text":"Salmon salad a great way to start eating healthy in the new year. Will & Heather very friendly and efficient."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere and friendly staff. Filet Minon Cobb salad is amazing.  Save room for dessert (sharing is caring)."}
{"text":"We were able to get a reservation at short notice. Very good food, excellent service...  The prime rib was excellent.   Deserts were huge and delicious.  Highly recommend."}
{"text":"We are from Chicago, so we know good restaurants and we can be picky.  We were on vacation with our kids and were told to come here with our kids.  Our youngest is 6 and although he will eat anything-there is not a kids menu option , so he shared with me.  We liked the decor although our waiter came over about 5 times in the first 20 minutes- and he didn't really smile that much....we had the AZ egg roll apps which were really tasty- I had filet which was good, my husband had the salmon which was also good and my daughter had a chicken sandwich which was fine- overall it was fine...nothing mind blowing...but good"}
{"text":"Really enjoyed the my dinner I had the other night. But the best part was the bread pudding for dessert. I would never order bread pudding but the server suggested it and it was amazing. Love to see servers being completely honest."}
{"text":"Tried the quinoa burger with a side of carrots... The burger was really good... The honey roasted carrots were delicious but too soft for liking... The service was great.. They even have lil bits of paper to throw way ur chewing gum"}
{"text":"Yummy!  We went here for New Years Eve and had some really good food.  Service was awsome.  We ordered the asparagus and cheese dip, good stuff.  We even got more chips delivered to our table without asking.  I got the Ahi tuna salad and the carrots.  I also got to try the salmon, green beans, french fries and grilled chicken by stealing off everyones plates.  All was good and everyone ate way too much.  We decided to share a brownie for desert...warm and sweet and I want another one now that I'm thinking about it.  The only sort of down side was how dark they keep the place but I do understand the concept, there is a light shining down on each table and this does keep your focus on the food and each other.  The staff is all dressed in black and sort of blend into the dark setting.  Kinda like ninja waiters, they show up and then disappear.  Very reasonable prices were a plus.  I want to go back an try other things on their menu, very good meal."}
{"text":"Whenever we visit friends in the area we visit White Chocolate at least a couple of times. Their quinoa burgers are about the best veggie-burger I've ever tasted. So good that, although I love beef burgers, I always go with the quinoa here. Sides are great, especially their brussel sprout \"salad\" and their Israeli couscous.  Every entree and app we tried was from really good to great.  Service is variable depending on your server. Most are excellent and friendly.  Desserts left a lot to be desired. Their apple pie is more of a pastry and overly sweet.  Overall, it is well worth a visit. I'd just skip the desserts."}
{"text":"The scallops were recommended by our server and they were delicious. The butter sauce was so good and perfect on the pallet. Our server was friendly and professional. Thanks to Josh out experience was perfect!"}
{"text":"The service here is wonderful. Let me start by saying that, our waitress (I'm mad I didn't remember her name) waited on us on the patio. She was so nice and our friend can be a little overwhelming and has a strange sense of humor. She made sure everything we wanted we got. Even modified the desert special so we could have a hybrid of the white chocolate chip ice cream and a brownie dessert. My filet was wonderful and at a great price of 24 bucks... Me living in san francisco where filet's cost 40 bucks a piece this was up to par. The corn salad is also worth mentioning, wonderful flavors. Anyway, I could have been happy with many items on their menu... Also, get the dragonberry lemonade it is on their specialty drinklist and is great on a hot day!!!"}
{"text":"Literally all of the food was brought out cold.  We had our $100 meal comped but it was a total disaster.  They didn't know how to handle it, it was extremely awkward (between the server and manager), etc.  The kitchen has a prep problem between the meat & the veggie/side staging areas, etc.  This is one POORLY MANAGED restaurant.  Tons of staff just walking all over the place, looking important, but not DOING ANYTHING.  Meanwhile, looking around, you can see everyone at every table has that glossy-eyed look just wondering when their server will be back.  Empty glasses, dirty plates, long food waits, etc.  Workflow is horrible, people are inefficient, etc.  Part of the problem is that there is a back-up for servers to enter the orders into the 2 computers near the kitchen.  We sat right next to this area and watched as servers spent waaaaay too much time tapping away on the screens.  This shouldn't be.  Bottom line - they need new managers and need to fire and re-train a bunch of staff.  Why they don't have HH in the restaurant area is beyond me."}
{"text":"I love White Chocolate Grill! We have one back home as well and it's amazing. The ambiance is very trendy and cool. The place is huge so luckily we didn't have to wait long.  We were greeted and served right away. I know this is random but their tomato soup is phenomenal! I went for their chicken enchiladas which was so delish and the guacamole was very good that came with it. I was hesitant to order Mexican food here given that it by no means specializes in it but was very pleasantly surprised. Yes this is a chain, but also very good"}
{"text":"Been here three times and every time it's great food and great service, came for Valentine's Day thinking we wouldn't get a seat but we got lucky and got sat quickly even though the place was bustling! Amazing seafood and the steaks are on point, not to mention the deserts!"}
{"text":"One of my all time favorite places.   The French Dip is amazing.  You must try it if you are there for lunch or dinner.   Save room for dessert.  Also try the white chocolate martini!!"}
{"text":"I went to dinner with friends. Everyone enjoyed their entree. The best part was dessert; white chocolate raspberry cheesecake. To die for!!"}
{"text":"We had some high hopes for this restaurant based on the posted yelp menu. I guess there used to be a Date Night 4-course meal, but it doesn't exist anymore. Not a big deal, but changed the game since items were priced around $15-20.   The food was tasty. We tried the Famous Chicken salad and the baby back ribs. Both were delicious and we loved them.   My only complaint is with the service. Our server seemed a little inattentive and preoccupied. Who doesn't bring extra napkins with an order of baby back ribs?! I don't really believe in docking stars for 1-time service, but just a tip to ask for this napkins while you order! ;)"}
{"text":"In AZ for the week and had some friends come to visit. First place we took them for dinner was, \"White Chocolate Grill\". Sat outside in the patio area where it is a lot easier to talk than in the main restaurant.  Since it's mid-November it was a little chilly but with the heaters on it was not a problem.  My girlfriend had the blackened fish sandwich which she said was \"outstanding\". Also tried the grilled salmon and Cajun chicken sandwich which were both \"excellent\" choices. Waiter was very attentive and service was \"unbeatable\"."}
{"text":"My husband has been raving about this place to me since he moved here in Dec/January. He keeps saying \"Hun, I gotta take you to this place when you move up here this soup they have is soooo delicious you'll love it!\" Lol...   We finally get to experience this restaurant last night and my first exciting appetizer order is to try this amazing soup my husband keeps raving about \"Gin tomato soup\" now for some reason I thought it was gin as in ginger tomato soup it didn't even dawn on me that he was talking about gin as in the alcohol until after,  I'm sooo excited to taste this soup and I took my first bite and it was amazingly good with a big kick... I was like what's in here now cuz I don't taste the ginger my husband says \"no it's not goner it's gin\" lol... Duh' he had to help me finish it! But, it was very delicious!  Everyone in here were sooo pleasantly nice and funny! I love when the waiters are relax and just have some humor in them it really breaks up the monotonous environment of being in a restaurant and being funny/laughing is good for the soul! We had Patrick as our waiter and another gentleman he was hilarious to have around just loved his personality! Both Patrick and him are amazing people and they know what's best for a first time customer such as myself...   We had their balsamic steaks and my husband/I shared I can't eat a whole steak by myself and I hate left overs never tastes the same. But, the balsamic steak that Patrick suggested to us was A-M-A-Z-I-N-G we had it at medium and it has so many Flavors going through your taste buds as it is aged steak marinated! To me that's a yummy steak where you are able to taste so much Flavors!   The next favorite that Patrick suggested we get was the bread pudding and I'm so blessed we had him as our waiter the bread pudding was off the chain! Sooo yummy I want to go back and have another steak/bread pudding/wedge salad!   Much Aloha to you Patrick, the other server (sorry I forgot your name.) and everyone else in the restaurant for being sooo really nice and helping us with dinner suggestions!"}
{"text":"Family of six went to celebrate Lord's Day.  The place was empty so we were seated immediately.  I would have liked to sit at a table since there was 6 of us but they put us in a huge booth.  Spencer our waiter was real nice but seem a bit nervous.  You can order bread but you must ask for it to get it,  nice hot bread with warm butter plus we had the spinach dip with nachos and the artichoke with cheese.  The artichoke was overpriced @ $10. so do not get it was not worth it, plus had no taste and was very bland.  The filet salad is huge and 2 people can share it, the pork loin was melt in your mouth.  The NY Strip is a solid 10oz and huge.  It was a bit tough, tougher than I am used to so next time I will order the Filet.  I was not happy with the fact that Atlantic Salmon sold for close to $19. and you can buy it for less than $3.00 a pound also the fact they did not tell their customers Atlantic Salmon is farm raised and loaded with chemicals, preservatives and anti-biotics.  No respectable restaurants should even serve farm raised Atlantic salmon, it is very unhealthy and linked to numerous diseases..  I was looking forward to the bread pudding but was very disappointed.  It was very sweet and just okay nothing to rave about.  I have made better bread pudding as well as you can get much better bread pudding else where.  The apple pie dessert is big enough for 4 people - some desserts are bigger than others and some are only big enough for one person. I would go back to try something else, like the chicken crepes or the filet.  The couscous was real good and the first time I had it.  The service was great.  The cost well - for the 6 of us - 5 adults and one child, the children's menu was great - 1/2 slab of ribs, with fries and a drink for only $5.99 - awesome...the total price with tip for the 6 of us was about $200.."}
{"text":"Besides the great food, Max, our waiter, was amazing!  The food was such a pleasant surprise and so tasty.  My husband tried the tomato / gin soup (must be 21 to order), and loved it!  Said he'd never tasted anything like it.  I thought he might lick the bowl!  We went during Happy Hour and had a variety of menu options, plus 20oz beer was $5.  The pork sliders were a big hit and the fries were the skinny, tasty ones.  Going back today (yes, it's that good), and the ribs are to be tried.  Another couple had a piece of cheesecake that was huge and surely a delight!  What a great find - be sure to try their Happy Hour...enjoy!"}
{"text":"White Chocolate Grill came highly recommended by friends and it did not disappoint.  The service, the food and the atmosphere were excellent.  We dined there for lunch after making a reservation on opentable.com.  We both had premium salads that were fresh, filling and delicious.  We didn't leave room for dessert this visit, but we surely will next time.  I look forward to returning to White Chocolate soon for a steak.  The menu posted on their website, www.whitechocolategrill.com, has a good steak selection and I am anxious to try one soon.  My lunch partner had the filet mignon salad and the filet was excellent."}
{"text":"Stopped in for dessert with two of my co-workers and I am glad we did. We had the Raspberry Cheesecake and the Chocolate Soufflé Cake and we all enjoyed them! The soufflé cake got a bit overwhelming and rich, probably could have used a scoop of ice cream to help with the richness. The cheesecake was definitely my favorite of the two. Both desserts were solid, but weren't super spectacular. I'm not sure if it would be my first choice for a dessert place, but it will probably be a better option than some of the other places in this shopping plaza.  The restaurant is pretty fancy and aesthetics wise is really nice. It was super dark however and it was tough to see my friends. Maybe it is meant to be more of a date night feel? Initially I was confused that a restaurant called White Chocolate Grill served more than desserts (it has dinner entrees, wine, etc), but the desserts were delicious so I just went with it. The prices are a bit more than my wallet is comfortable with but overall it is definitely a nice restaurant for dates, a nice family dinner or to enjoy some good dessert with friends."}
{"text":"Terrible customer service.   I ordered the cobb salad and brussel sprouts. The brussel sprouts came first I tried them and they were excellent. The salad came with steak . It looked great presentation wise but I wanted it with chicken.  It took 20 more minutes,  came out with a cold fork all jumbled with horrible presentation.  The nimrod bald manager made no apologies for the delay or poor presentation.  Just excuses.  I will not be back."}
{"text":"My friend and I decided to have lunch here.  We had been there once before and really liked it.  It was about 1:30 and very, very, noisy when we entered.  We ask for the quietest table and she placed us next to a table with 3 wild children.  We ordered drinks and the house Margarita was good and tangy.  I had a side Caesars salad and it was really good and plenty big.  My friend had the salmon and couscous and he said it was \"good\" but not outstanding.   I had the \"rib steak\" but it was really small, tough (like shoe leather)  and certainly not worth the $27.95.  It had a strange tasting sauce on top as well.  The shoe string potatoes were only warm on the plate.  We ordered apply pie but when it came, it was more of an apple danish with puff pastry.  it tasted good but it wasn't an apple pie.  Over all, I was disappointed.  The grill is not \"cheap\" and frankly if you are going to charge that much money for each item, it better be really good and sadly it wasn't."}
{"text":"I guess it's time to update this review after my most recent experience. I'm not a complicated diner, neither is my wife, but for some reason at White Chocolate Grill, at least this particular location, getting the orders right has always been a problem. On my last visit, that problem was escalated by their jerk of a general manager and that's where I drew the line and decided to never go back.  So what happened? My wife orders the chicken sandwich, with only lettuce and tomato. Pretty simple right? Unfortunately not. As had become painfully commonplace at this location, the sandwich shows up wrong. There is cheese on it, which my wife absolutely detests. I sent it back immediately with the food runner, as our server was (of course) not present when the food came out. The server showed up minutes later to find me starring at my own food as it got cold, while my wife had no plate at all. When he inquired what happened, I unloaded and told him that for what was probably the fourth time, they'd botched a simple request to get us a plain sandwich with just lettuce and tomato. It's always something, either the cheese or they leave everything on it, you name it, they've done it. He tells me he'll send the manager over.  The manager indeed came over, corrected sandwich in hand, about 2 minutes later. After dropping it on the table and following a contrite, absolutely insincere apology he attempted to slink off before I could say anything. I stopped him and asked why this continues to be a problem, why it is so difficult at this restaurant but no other I've ever been to, to get a simple order correct. The manager starts his tirade with the words,'I don't want to argue with you, sir, but ...' and then launches into this ridiculous explanation about how it's actually our fault for ordering it wrong. In his world a chicken sandwich is like a cheeseburger, and when you order it plain, it still comes with cheese. I pointed out that this made no sense, since it isn't a cheese-sandwich and there's no expectation that it should come with cheese when ordered plain or 'only with', etc. He shrugged it off, argued further that cheese is on the meat and the lettuce, tomato, onion and may is on the other side with the bun, so therefore, somehow, cheese is not a condiment like all the rest so it made sense to include cheese when we asked for lettuce and tomato only.  No, I am not making this stuff up, but that is absolutely what he said. When I asked him how to correct the problem on future visits, given his outlook on how we're too stupid to order properly, he said, no lie, \"You need to tell the server you want to order a chicken sandwich, plain, then specify no cheese, then ask them to add lettuce and tomato.\" I almost fell out of the chair. My wife and I just stared at him blankly, said \"O...K....\" and with that he made another insincere, \"Well, sorry,\" and off he went.  And no, for the record, he did not comp us on any part of the meal, not even in part. The server had the nerve to ask if we were going to order dessert as well and showed us the menu. No it was not an offer of a free dessert for the trouble, it was an up-sell, apparently. Wow.  My wife and I left a $1 tip and a note for the server to get the rest of his tip from the manager that had the sheer nerve to argue with a customer. I complained directly to the corporate office in Scottsdale and, believe it or not, the general manager even argued with the customer relations person. His explanation for his actions, when she followed up with him? \"We get people complaining if we ask too many questions, like whether or not they also want the cheese.\" Really? You have got to be kidding me! I have never in my life seen someone tell a server that they asked too many questions. Is that the best line he could come up with?  Given that the manager argues with corporate rather than apologize, I have absolutely no intention of ever bringing my business back to this place. Mind you, I've been going to this location for over a year and have taken numerous people with me, including family, friends and coworkers, heck I even arranged a 20 person party on their patio at one point. This experience cost them a lot of business by treating us this way, and I've made sure to tell as many people about my experience as possible since I work nearby.  There are plenty of good restaurants in the same plaza, I suggest you check them out before you waste your time and money giving patronage to an establishment that treats customers in this fashion, especially at the GM level."}
{"text":"Fantastic service, delicious food and a nice atmosphere. What more could you ask for?"}
{"text":"This is absolutely our favorite restaurant of any restaurant we've ever been to. I cannot understand why they don't have a 5-star rating. Maybe the prices? Well, the food is worth it. Maybe the lack luster desserts? OK, I get that.  But, we usually don't eat dessert in a restaurant, so we could care less if they suck.   The main food and appetizers, however, the absolute best. I wish we could afford to eat here more often, but in the real world we don't all make millions. However, when we want to go out for a good meal, we love to go here. Had the BBQ platter and I wasn't expecting it to be great, but I was craving BBQ. It was some of the best BBQ I've had and I was blown away surprised.   My wife had the jambalaya. It comes with huge shrimp and she's a very \"plain\" kind of eater. She orders cheeseburgers with just cheese and ketchup. She eats spaghetti with just noodles and sauce. Her salads are lettuce and dressing. However, she LOVES the jambalaya.   Also had the prime rib and, to your amazement, they actually made it a medium rare! I usually order medium rare knowing they'll make it a medium. I like medium rare as well, but they usually make it rare. I took a chance and WCG delivered.  Everything else was great. I'm not impressed by their desserts, and I suggest you steer clear of the apple pie, you won't like it. It's not a slice of apple pie like you'd think. But again, we come here for the food and this is our favorite place to eat in Scottsdale, in Arizona, in any where we've been. Has to be the best restaurant in North Scottsdale hands down."}
{"text":"My GF and I fluttered over to the WCG the other night.    I was informed that WCG is \"reallllly good but kinda pricey\".    Pshaw, I laugh in the face of pricey...   (except at Mastro's, then I cry like a little girl).    Walking in, I noticed the  oustide of the place was modern and lemmie tell ya, I like modern.  Well lets say modernish...yeah.  Before we took the plunge inside, I decided to read the gilded framed menu suspended next to the entry door;  while I was reading at least 2 different blue hairs going in had to stop and tell me how FABULOUS the food was .  Hook , line and sinker.  I mean, if you can't believe the old farts, who can you believe?  This place is kinda dark inside. Not deliverance or deer hunter dark, but \"I need a night light\" sorta dark.  I agree with the other yelper, this place is a nap-danger for adults.  Soup should be served sparingly inside to prevent table drownings.  It was rather nice inside though, I liked it.. just dark.  The booth was nice and squishy too, just the way i like em'.  I had the 6 oz filet, and my dahlin' had the crab cakes.  Both were quite tasty, but my mashed 'taters were kinda sub par considering the price tag. (why are masheds so ignored?? WHY??)  Granted we orderd off the date menu, a fixed price bastard that let us choose 1 app, 2 salads, 2 entrees, and 1 dessert to share.  I'd bore the crap outta you if I went into details about every course, but they were all good in a passable kinda way.  I'm writing this review aren't I?  Irony upon irony, the desserts you could pick from on said \"date\" menu, even though ALL desserts are listed at the same price, did not include the white chocolate cheese cake.  Black flagged again.  I even tried to substitute and the staunchly refused.  I will get even with them I swear.  Synopsis (sp?)  not bad, but once again AZ has introduced me to another restaurant that I don't want to frequnent often if I don't have too.  I really wanted to love WCG, but I think I'll stick with TGIF's."}
{"text":"Husband and I ate here for lunch. Service and food were fantastic! He got the filet cobb salad and I got the filet steak sandwich. Both were excellent. The only negative thing I could say is that my iced tea was extremely weak. I like weak iced tea, but this was barely a step up from water. Still, five stars for the food and service."}
{"text":"The is a great restaurant with an off-putting name. The food is consistently delicious. I love their salmon dishes, their salads, and the service. The WCG salad with bacon and blue cheese is a guilty pleasure. My husband loves the crab cakes, which are much more crab than cake. The spaghetti squash side is delicious. Always ask about the specials. I had a divine beet salad special. My husband always orders the grilled artichoke appetizer when in season. My friend Jazz loves the chicken enchiladas; the tortilla soup is good as well. This is our go-to place when visitors come in from out of town. A reservation is a must if you're going at a peak time. Forget the goofy name and go! We're glad we did."}
{"text":"The food is pricey but really good. I had the blackened salmon and it was cooked to perfection. My wife has the ribeye also tasty. If I were celebrating something I think I would come back again."}
{"text":"Everything I've had here is wonderful.  The service is wonderful.  The ambiance is comfortable.  They recently added guacamole to the appetizers and I'll tell you what, I think its one of the best ones I've had outside of my own.  I crave the Spit Roasted Turkey Melt.  It really does melt in your mouth.  Wish I had one now.  I've enjoyed the Tomato Gin Soup, Filet Mignon Cobb Salad, Classic French Dip and Rotisserie Chicken Crepes.  All wonderful.  Sides I like: Israeli Couscous, Fresh-Cut Fries and Freshly Mashed Potatoes."}
{"text":"Went back a couple of weeks ago and thought I was hallucinating.  Let me preface by saying that every age group has a right to eat wherever they want and I am ok with that.  It was just eerie that, after I double checked every booth, I was the youngest person there.  People, I am not young.  As usual, service was very good.  The food was ok, not great.  Clearly it is relying on the tried and true vs exciting.  The restaurant is still attractive, but the atmosphere isn't the same when you overhear those around you complain multiple times to the server how salty the food is and how cold it is in there (as a Phoenix native who finds 85 degrees my perfect temp, I am confident in saying it was definitely not cold in there).  WCG is still good for a nice family dinner and would not be a good choice for date night or girls/guys night out."}
{"text":"Great food in a modern atmosphere!  The Ribeye Steak is off the charts - just explodes with flavor. The Citrus-Soy Salmon is super moist and flavorful!  The staff were very welcoming and friendly. We definitely found our new date night spot!"}
{"text":"Amazing food quality- had the Tuna sashimi appetizer- amazingly fresh and wonderful flavors. Dinner was tilapia- excellent choice and perfect portion size. Save room for the cheesecake- it was seriously amazing with the strawberry sauce."}
{"text":"We dine at this restaurant very frequently and we also get takeout a lot here. It's very disappointing to call to order something to go and them tell me that I can't place an order until 8:30 tonight.  I've never been told that I couldn't place a to go order here or anywhere else in Scottsdale because they can't handle the volume of customers. Melting Pot doesn't allow take out...I get that.  It's not like to go orders are discounted or anything. This is NOT a cheap restaurant, by any means, and our order is normally well over $100.  I bet any Sam Fox restaurant would have no problem taking our order on a weekday at 6:15.  Maybe the manager, Dan, should have offered something for the inconvenience.  Yes, you have great food, but you should treat all of your customers the same whether it's dine in or take out."}
{"text":"This was my second time at the White Chocolate Grill. Yet again, they did an amazing job! I had the Citrus Soy Glazed Salmon - it was so delicious! That and their mashed potatoes! Definitely get the white chocolate brownie. It is to die for! That's the reason why I wanted to go their for my birthday! :)"}
{"text":"After reading the 1-3 star reviews on this place, I am beginning to wonder if we ate at the same place!?  DH and I went in at 4:00 on a Sunday - neither of us hungry but both of us unwilling to miss a chance to (finally) eat here.  We live in the wild, wild west and north Scottsdale is just NOT on my food rotation.  So... the menu.  We couldn't pick an app - there were so many good choices!  It is usually the opposite for me because I am so picky.  We decided to stick with apps because neither of us were hungry enough for a sandwich or other meal.  He ordered the chicken egg rolls (pretty sure there was more descriptor, but I forgot it) and they were PLENTIFUL (I think six?) and HOT and delicious.  I ordered the homemade guac.  Let it be known - I love my OWN homemade guac, so this was a real test.  It was SO fresh and SO amazing - just the right amount of cilantro and just the right size of avocado pieces.  We ordered the white chocolate raspberry cheesecake to go.  The white chocolate literally melts in your mouth - worth every freakin' calorie.  Our drinks were never down more than 2 inches (a biggie for the hubs).  If we lived closer we'd probably go biweekly... too bad we need a small plane to beth there from home."}
{"text":"This has become my once a week splurge.  Everything I have eaten has been absolutely amazing.  My favorites:  Filet Cobb Salad Filet steak sandwich French dip  Burgers are amazing as well, I do need to try the steak and prime rib one day."}
{"text":"This place was really, really good. So good I would drive from Gilbert to go again. I had the prime rib and it was excellent! The dessert was also amazing."}
{"text":"This place has been a good standby for the better part of a year now. The atmosphere is fun, even if its crowded you don't feel smashed in like at Cheesecake Factory or some other massive chain. The food has always been somewhere between really good and great. They get bonus points for having Sokol Blosser # ?? (I think this is how it is listed on the menu) on the menu - seriously one of our favorite alternative wines AKA Evolution Luck.   If that's all there was to it I would give the White Chocolate Grill 4 stars. But then there is dessert. We have yet to go wrong with dessert but the clear winner is the pumpkin cheese cake - which is seasonal. This is seriously one of the best desserts of my life. Literally I took a bite and my eyes squeezed shut and I dropped my fork loudly on the table - my first foodgasm I think. Unbelievable."}
{"text":"Being new to Phoenix, my first lunch outing was to The White Chocolate Grill!   I didn't know what to expect with the name of the venue but I'm really glad I gave it a try.  For an appetizer, we had the Ahi Tuna, which was fabulous but took long to come out of the kitchen. We wondered why, then a manager came to our table apologized and informed us that the ticket was overlooked and the cost of the appetizer would be taken off our bill. My boyfriend and I both agreed that even though it took longer then expected it was not a big deal and the app was definitely worth the wait. That kind of recognition is always a plus and makes a customer want to frequent a place more do to the venues thoughtfulness and great customer service.  For the main course of our lunch, my boyfriend ordered the baby back ribs with mash potatoes and broccoli as his sides and I ordered the Chopped Salad. Both dishes were delicious!   Can't wait to go back and explore other items on the menu!"}
{"text":"I've been 3 times now, and each time has been a delight.  The guac, salsa, and chips were a big surprise because I expected ordinary and got superb.  So much flavor!  The drinks have been well balanced and delicious.  Smoked meats were juicy, tender, and aromatic.  But the biggest hit has been the Gin Tomato Soup.  Oh, man, that stuff is tasty!  Service and ambiance were very good, in line with the prices."}
{"text":"Had a business dinner here at the White Chocolate Grill last night and it was great!   I ordered the ribeye with sweet carrots AND had an old fashion for a beverage.  Awesome location, great vibe."}
{"text":"From the appetizers, entrées, and desserts, The seven of us loved everything at this place. Prior to finding this restaurant, Tommy Bahamas had always been our favorite! We definitely recommend this place. Our server was very very good too. (I think his name was Marty?) we had guacamole, spinach and artichoke dip, tomato basil soup with gin, fresh corn salad with vinaigrette. Our entrées were a turkey sandwich, filet and ribeye steaks, tuna, Great chicken salad, desserts were the famous cheesecake, bread pudding, Blondie, and apple pie. We are seriously thinking about going back again tomorrow while we are here for the week on a business trip."}
{"text":"Good service.  Had the Kale and Spinach salad.  Even though it was lightly dressed, it was a little salty for my taste.  But the good service and nice decor makes me want to go back."}
{"text":"Beautiful restaurant. Quick friendly service. More than willing to accommodate my requests for my toddler. The ribs were excellent. The waiter suggested the Brussels sprout side which was also very good. A nice large old fashioned to start and an overall great experience. Highly recommend, you can't go wrong."}
{"text":"This is the first time I have gone here.  We had a group of about 11 people, and had reservations.  We were seated right away on the patio.  It was a nice evening.  The food was quite good and reasonably priced.  I would have rated the restaurant as 4 star.  So far, so good.  My problem is that the waiter (Westmorland?) could have done much better.  He took our orders and the food was served in a timely manner.  As is often the case, people from the kitchen brought out and served the meals.  Our waiter never came around until the meals were almost finished to see if everything was OK.  It was not.  Had he come around, I would have asked for Tabasco sauce, as well as bread.  By the time he asked, there was no need for the Tabasco sauce.  In terms of the bread, he said that it is brought only if asked for.  If that was the case, I think he should have asked if we wanted bread.  If it is the management's policy of not delivering bread unless asked for, the menu should have stated so.  Would we come back?  Sure.  Would we ask for Westmorland?  No.  If we were seated put at his station, we would not ask to be reseated.  He did not do a bad job, but he surely could have done a lot better."}
{"text":"We tried this restaurant on a whim, and very much enjoyed our experience. There was 5 of us, and we each ate a different type of meal including the chicken salad (nice portion), steak, scallops, burger etc.   We didn't notice that the food was taking \"longer than normal to cook\", but we received a free dessert out of it, so no complaints here!   We will return again when we're in town!"}
{"text":"Really comfortable atmosphere. Service is excellent. Always there when you needed them, but they didn't hover either. A welcome change from many places. Hover or disappear.  Friends and I stopped in for a bite and a glass of wine before a film. We gave ourselves plenty of time so we could relax after a busy day at work. We needed some wind-down time. White Chocolate was the perfect atmosphere to do just that.  Oh, and the food . . . . it was very good. Served quickly and there was a variety of choices on the menu. Everyone was pleased.    Only change I would suggest is that a small piece of white chocolate come with the bill. Would have been the perfect finish to an otherwise good experience."}
{"text":"Last night me and my wife went to the White chocolate Grill we had a 6 o'clock reservation and got right in.My wife had a chicken salad that she said was not that good and I had the chicken crapes. The chicken crapes were very good the mushroom sauce on top was a little over powering. We got the banana cream pie dessert which after two bites each we stopped eating because it was terrible. It Had a bad aftertaste. After notifying the waitress they removed it from our bill no problem. Overall the service was good the food was OK. Nothing I'm going to drive across town for again but would try it again if I was in the area."}
{"text":"I decided to try this place out when my family came in to town for my sons birthday The menu looked great, good wine list, and they were able to take a reservation for 8 plus two high chairs. I said inside bc it was 105 out that day and with two babies inside is a better choice typically.  5 * goes to Sean, our server. He was on top of everything, and just came across as a thoughtful sincere guy. My child had probably the biggest meltdown of his life thus far and so I took him home while everyone else stayed and Sean gave me a new salad bc I only was able to take two bites. Among picking up the countless things my 1 yr old threw.   3* goes to our tables... In the bar... A high bar table...With only room for one high chair. So my pissy kid was stuck well below everyone and I can't help but think if he had been same height as us and been able to interact maybe he coulda made it through me eating dinner. Woulda been nice to know when I made the reservation, I was pretty annoyed when we were seated.  I hope to go back, sit in Sean's section, not in the bar and make it through dinner."}
{"text":"Food is average,  a good place for lunch.  Portions are large.  Reminds me of a chain restaurant even though it is not.    Been here a couple of times, I had the kale and spinach salad and it was not my favorite.   A few Large pieces of tough kale with spinach drenched in dressing.  I had to remove all the pieces of chicken because they were cold and a little slimy."}
{"text":"Upscale bar and restaurant (like Yardhouse).  The interior is dark, zen, with modern touches.  The food was forgettable.  I tried the ribs (fall off the bones, but sauce was too smokey and sweet - $21 ish), bbq bacon burger with fries (burger was nothing special and the fries were thin and crispy; meh - $12) french dip sandwich (bread was soggy and meat was flavorless; meh - $12), WCG brownie (blonde brownie with white and brown chocolate sauce topped with a scoop of vanilla ice cream; meh - $7), and the banana cream pie (home made granola crust that is crisp and not crunchy; meh - $7).  Other important info: abundant parking, server had to nearly scream the daily specials because the place was too loud, bathroom stalls have frosted glass doors, this place is located in SCOTTSDALE."}
{"text":"People at work talk about this place like it's the greatest restaurant ever, so when a co-worker and I decided to take a long lunch, we went here. I made a reservation on OpenTable, which I thought was kind of silly since it was just lunch, but I'm so glad I did. I swear every businessman and bored housewife in North Scottsdale eats lunch here.  I ordered the Ahi Tuna Salad and my co-worker got the Filet Mignon Cobb Salad. My salad was super tasty and had a generous portion of perfectly cooked tuna. I sampled the steak on my friend's salad, and it was really good.  Although our food was really good, $40 for lunch for 2 people is a bit steep, especially when neither of us drank. I could go to Pita Jungle and have a similar salad, and it wouldn't be $16. The interior also seemed like it was trying to mimic Houston's/Hillstone, but something felt off about it. The happy hour menu looked pretty decent. I might stop in after work to try that out."}
{"text":"One of my favorite restaurants to go to for a special occasion. Really nice and modern atmosphere, but, what really matters is the food, and man is it good! I always get their delicious steak dinner with the spinach artichoke dip as an app. And, if you do go, splurge on dessert and go an extra day to the gym, because their white chocolate brownie is AMAZING."}
{"text":"Jumbo lump crab cakes are one of my top favorite foods. The jumbo lump crab cakes at White Chocolate Grill were certainly not my number one crab cakes... that honor would fall to somewhere back east. HOWEVer, they were lumpy, not too bready, quite tasty. We also go the souffle cake the only REAL chocolate dessert on the menu! yumm.  We had a lot of fun here, splitting the cheapest bottle of wine on the menu and enjoying some pretty good food. From the outside I expected the experience to be similar to Bonefish or similar chain-- you know what you're going to get. Pleasantly surprised."}
{"text":"Visiting from out of town, and this might have been the best tasting food in this town.  At first, I made a reservation for 730 and arrived 10 minutes early, but our table wasn't even ready at 730 :/ I understand your restaurant is busy, but when you accept reservations, have some available tables.   Our server, Brian, however, is probably the best spirited guy we met waiting tables! He was funny, responsive, and checked up on us constantly.   On the other hand, the food was pretty good--hot and tasty. It wasn't super excellent, but satisfying. I had the balsamic rib eye steak, fish, and rack of ribs from here. (We all shared. I didn't order 3 plates lol) All flavorful and cooked perfectly. There was something off however; for the number of people that eat there, you'd think it'd actually be more gourmet, but the taste is anything but.   I did order a cocktail, the key lime martini...don't order it. It's like a milky vodka with graham cracker on the rim; sadly, the cracker was the best part of that drink.   The dessert, however, is excellent. Sweet and delicious for those that have a sweet tooth. And they go well with tea and coffee ;)   I would say this place is the best in the area for ordering American :)"}
{"text":"Excellent choice.  Egg roll and ahi appetizers were great. Blue cheese crusted filet with Brussels sprouts was perfect."}
{"text":"Best meal I've had in a long long time. I started with the wedge salad and had the Parmesan crusted steak with a side a broccoli. The steak was cooked perfectly and it melts in your mouth. We ended our meal with the raspberry cheesecake which was absolutely incredible. It has a kind of pretzel/graham cracker crust. So good!"}
{"text":"This place was suggested by a local who had just moved here from CA. As for the service all I have to say is amazing!  it's not just one person serving you but everybody around you.Everybody's nice and polite and willing to help.   Great ambiance!!  We loved it so much we returned the next day, the only negative thing I have to say is the person that was working up front short red hair the hostess. She was unlike the rest with an attitude and no willingness to help us get seated and a proper table for six. That was the only negative thing I found and I think of management handles that this place is hands down one of the top restaurants in AZ."}
{"text":"I love desserts.  And as much as I wish it wasn't true, it just is.  White Chocolate Grill does nothing to help my bad habit, in fact, I can't leave this place without having a dessert. And it's all their fault!  The location of this restaurant is great.  It's at the 101 and Scottsdale, so you can catch a movie when it's over or hit up one of the other restaurant bars in the shopping complex.  The menu isn't very extensive and you may be surprised to learn that it's mostly classic American fare.  You'll find salads, burgers, sandwiches, ribs, chicken and fish dishes here, but it's all artfully presented.  I've had the fish sandwich and it was pretty darn good.  The spinach artichoke dip makes a great appetizer too. But no matter what you order, save room for dessert.  Try the white chocolate banana cream pie, white chocolate brownie or the chocolate souffl cake- all are amazing.  While their food is good, it's the desserts at White Chocolate Grill that really stand out"}
{"text":"I really enjoyed this place, we sat outside which was kind of enclosed and misted so it was pleasant to eat there. Our waiter was really nice and got us some drinks started which were pretty strong, so no complaints there. We had the bacon, blue cheese salad and added steak and it was so good. we also shared the blackened fish sandwich which was also amazing. I had the Israeli couscous as a side and it made the meal. The portions are large but we managed to squeeze in a dessert, who wouldn't in a place called the white chocolate grill?! We had the white chocolate brownie, made for two it was huge and after dinner we didn't finish it but definitely worth a taste. I would recommend it to anyone in the area looking for a casual dinner. The bar area was nice too with tables all facing the tvs if thats your thing."}
{"text":"One of our favorite restaurants in the valley! I have never had anything bad here. You can't go wrong with a filet. My favorite is a the filet Cobb salad. The ribs and chicken are great too."}
{"text":"I've always been a happy camper leaving this place.  They have a very cool looking bar with their bottles lit up and colorful. I like sitting at the tables around it even though the lighting is bad. It's like the flashlight under your face effect. Not cute! I prefer the Sesame Crusted Ahi Tuna for the appetizer. The tuna comes out on a slaw that tastes amazing with a soy dressing and a side of wasabi you can mix in. This isn't a fish restaurant but I get on a fish-kick and LOVE their Blacked Fish Sandwich. It's always cooked perfectly and really like the sauce. The steamed broccoli are big pieces and always fresh. I wouldn't recommend the honey roasted carrots - they are soaked in whatever they are calling honey roasted and just tastes like carrots coated in sugar. Yuck.  I like dessert and like chocolate but don't like anything from here. Maybe too much white chocolate for me."}
{"text":"This would have been a one star review except the incredible management which comped our meal. Let me preface by saying we came here from a very poor experience in Tucson. Literally drove back home and decided to hop by for a meal end dessert, hoping to override a poor experience we'd just had. Well, unfortunately, it was \"not my day\" for dining, and our experience here was pretty aweful. As I said, we stopped in for dessert. We were seated in surprisingly short time, considering the line and proposed \"20-minute\" wait. However, despite our short wait, we were in there for 45 minutes. Yes, 45 minutes, for dessert. That is how much I ususally spend if I am chatty with friends for an entire meal. A friendly waitress greeted us and took our drink orders (Some Cherry Coke to compliment) We then waited quite some time for our \"official\" waitress to come, and when she got there, she did not smile, say thank you for coming, or anything. We gave her our order and asked for a side of grenadine to make the cherry coke stronger. She obliged the grenadine and ran off with our order. We were not attended to until the dessert came out. I would have waited an hour for good, fresh, and warm dessert, but alas after about 10 minutes they came out. The White brownie dessert was cold, the other lukewarm. When she brought us a second cherry coke (which had no extra grenadine, despite the fact I had to order some earlier) My twin got her attention and said \"It's cold\".  She did not say \"I'm so sorry\" she just said \"Ok\" and snatched, literally, the dessert from the table. She asked me if mine was too, I said it could use a little warmth, she took them both back. NO APOLOGY, no NOTHING. We waited another 10 or 15 minutes, and got warm dessert. DURING THIS ENTIRE TIME she talked and checked on the table across from us NONSTOP. We had to sit around with no soda, and had had the cold dessert for some time. We were relieved when they came back out perfectly warm, although there was more dark chocolate sauce on the white brownie this time. They were delightful! Finally, she checked on us, brought our bill again and I asked for a to-go for my bread pudding. I watched this woman bring out 5 other tables dishes, two to go boxes, and chat with the table opposite us 3 times. We were waiting for her also to take the card. FINALLY she came over, by this time I muttered \"about time\" under my breath, thats how long it was! Another someodd minutes and we finally had the bill back. We were angry, we loved the food, but this woman had not SERVED us, so I wrote a big ZERO where the tip was. It would be different if she'd smiled at least ONCE or apologized for being so busy or had a good attitude, but this woman had a big frown the whole time. So we asked for a manager to tell them about this. She comped our meal, even though we were perfectly happy paying for the food and not the service. The food was delightful. I was very grateful for the dessert meal comp, but I will never go back again. This was pretty aweful in service. It should never take 45 minutes to get and eat a dessert. Period. It wouldnt be worth going back."}
{"text":"Had dinner on a Sat and the place is packed.  I totally recommend trying to make a reservation or you will have to wait a bit for seating.  It is a happening dinner spot.  We had AZ eggrolls and they were great and each ordered a steak and a fish entree.  And tried the WCG brownie.  Everything was fabulous and would come back here again.  Give it try"}
{"text":"One of my fave restaurants in North Scottsdale and also while living in Colorado.  Ambiance is beautiful, food is delicious, service is always stellar. A great time to go is during Happy Hour when you can sample things at a much lower price. Just love it!"}
{"text":"Cozy comfortable seating and atmosphere. I had the ahi salad and it was delicious! The service was great! I would definitely go back."}
{"text":"This place has for a longtime been an all-time favorite... in particular it's the turkey sandwich with the mushroom gravy. It is by far one of the best sandwiches I've had and as I'm typing this post I remover when I was introduced to it, over 10 years ago!!! I bought a car at the dealership across the way and one of the guys told me try out this place... best advice.   In addition to the turkey sandwich they have some of the best pork and steak fillet to offer.   Staff is very helpful & our experience was great. Definitely coming back with and without the family.  The kids themselves are anxious to come back and try some of he other items on the menu!"}
{"text":"Excellent food and great atmosphere and good service. The tomato soup, artichoke appetizer, hamburger, fries, sashimi, salads are each excellent."}
{"text":"Great food and dessert...total scottsdale snobbery atmosphere."}
{"text":"We had a great lunch, one of the best salads!  Kind of pricy but worth it. Wait staff very attendant and pleasant.  Will definitely be back.  When asking for a quiet place for my 99 yr old friend, was put next to the kitchen so had kitchen noise and talkers to contend with. Not so great."}
{"text":"3 things:  White Chocolate Grill, White Chocolate Brownie, White Chocolate Will.  Came in for an espresso and dessert to share with my mother-in-law at 12 noon on a Tuesday, and this place was buzzing! Huge lunch rush, yet we were promptly seated in Will's section. What a great guy! Service was fast and friendly, between him, the hostess, the busser, and the girl who took our drink order. The espresso was hot with a perfect lemon twist, and the brownie was so decadent!!! It had shavings of white chocolate sprinkled evenly over the plate in perfect thickness so as to melt on your tongue. Everyone was working efficiently, and again, Will really made our experience with his knowledge and personality. We'll be back!"}
{"text":"Probably not what you're expecting but - hands down the BEST ranch sauce I've ever had. It wasn't your typical ranch sauce.   I ordered the chicken strips which weren't overly crispy which is good. It also comes with 3 sauces - BBQ, honey mustard and THE BEST RANCH EVER.   The White Chocolate Blondie Brownie was spectacular. Not too sweet and was delicious.  Happy Hour ends at 6pm, so I recommend getting there before that time!"}
{"text":"Absolutely delicious! One of the best meals I've had in a loong time! Service was great!"}
{"text":"Exceptional meal, the French Dip rivals that of Huston's...my Mom had the Pork Tenderloin with a side of Glazed Carrots, simple yet delicious! Hubby had the Fried Chicken Salad, fresh & delicious as well.  When our meal was over Mom mentioned to the waiter this was the best meal she has ever had in a restaurant, she eats out for 80% of her meals...a HUGE compliment to WCG.. Thank you for one excellent meal, we definitely will be back"}
{"text":"4.5 stars! My awesome friend took me here and we ordered some scrumptious desserts!  French White Chocolate Bread Pudding 4/5 White Chocolate Raspberry Cheesecake  5/5  The ambiance is nice and if you order one of their whiskey drinks in comes in a fancy glass that rolls around in a circle. The bartender educated us and said its to add to the flavor. Awesome place! ;)"}
{"text":"Pretty good modern american food, similar in concept to Houstons but with a much more extensive menu. It's really loud here so when it gets busy it's really hard to hear your companions. Also they accept reservations!  I've had some great things and some meh things here. For appetizers, the shrimp cocktail and guacamole are winners!  The guacamole is actually remarkably good...my only comment there is that the chips are soooo thin and the guacamole soooo chunky that you actually can't use your chip as a scoop because they just break.   But the artichoke appetizer is just not exciting and too wet.   For entrees, I've had great burgers, a super French Dip,  and some great salads.  But a few losers are  chicken Madeira with overpowering sauce, the scallops which I thought were overcooked, and today's filet mignon Cobb salad. The steak on the salad was blue and they hadn't asked how I wanted it when I ordered. I think if you're not going to ask, medium would've been a safer bet than blue-rare.  They did take it off my bill though.   In this particular part of town, this is the restaurant I go to most. But just taken as a restaurant in Phoenix/Scottsdale, Hillstone or Houstons blows the place out of the water."}
{"text":"I will be leaving Phoenix soon and I can honestly say I will miss not being able to go to WCG any longer. I took my girlfriend for a bye bye to Phoenix dinner and we have an amazing evening. We had a reservation and we were taken to our table immediately. We got the bread pudding which was AMAZING! We have been wanting to try it since our first visit and for  one reason or another we never did.      We had a few servers stop by our table and they did a great job."}
{"text":"I think this is my new place to go for real good food. Made to order and very fresh. It's hard to find good food and service nowadays. Thanks for actually making me leave a restaurant with mouth watering tingling aftertaste...   ha :)"}
{"text":"Such a disappointment how a place that was once the toast of the town, has fallen so far. I've been coming here for over 15 years and the last 3 times  have been awful. Overcooked chicken, over dressed salad and food arrives all wrong. Last time for the WCG"}
{"text":"This place has the very best French Dip Sandwich in the world. It's a must try. Melts in your mouth."}
{"text":"A very lovely atmosphere. Our waiter was Anthony and he did an excellent job, especially with my gluten free allergy. If you go there, get the ribs. They literally fall off the bone!  My only disappointment with this restaurant is the seats, I hate having to look way up to my waiter. That was annoying. Otherwise, reasonably priced for the quality you get. They even have a gluten free dessert to die for!"}
{"text":"Perfect setting for a great date night.  I went with my girlfriend and we really enjoyed the feel of the place, as well as our food and service.  It can be a little loud at times, but they did a nice job on the layout so that you can choose a quieter table if desired.  My New York Strip was perfectly cooked, and my girlfriend's salmon was fantastic.  We had a great time, and will definitely be back."}
{"text":"over-hyped TGI Fridays.  Ate here on a business dinner while in Phoenix.  It was not a memorable experience and I would recommend that anyone considering going here takes a look at anywhere else nearby.  Five-Guys burgers would be a better bet.  Sorry, not a place I would like to return to"}
{"text":"yumm for the 2nd time.  went and had the ribs, tomato gin soup without any regrets.  the ribs fell off the bone as they described.  made reservations via yelp which i recommend since it gets super busy for dinner.  the service was great.  will go back."}
{"text":"A little pricey, but delicious!  The salad with the yogurt dressing is amazing (though heavy on dressing so you may want to order it on the side). The Artichoke appetizer I dream about even though it is only available like 1/4 times I go. And the cheesecake...YUM!"}
{"text":"Wow I can't believe I haven't written a review of White Chocolate yet.  I had lunch here yesterday with two friends and have been here a couple other times for dinner. I have to say I enjoyed dinner more than lunch, but lunch was pretty good too.  When I've dined here for dinner the food and the service has been nothing less than excellent. As an added bonus the waiters are all very handsome. It must be a prerequisite for getting a job here.  With all of this you may wonder why I gave them four stars. It's really because of lunch. I wasn't feeling the greatest since I had a cold. They seated us at a booth where the AC was blowing right down on the table. Someone should have checked this out when the space was built out. Couple that with the food taking longer than it should have and it just didn't make for the best experience.   I wish Yelp had 4 1/2 stars because that's what they really deserve."}
{"text":"This has now become my go-to restaurant when visiting Phoenix! In fact, we went out of our way to come here last week because we knew it would be a 5-star experience.  My new favorite salad in the world is the seared ahi tuna with ginger and sesame dressing - it could not be more perfect! We also ordered the crab cakes (light and fluffy) and of course, shared a dessert. The dessert was a little rich for my liking, but it was to be expected from a place with Chocolate in the name.   Hope I get to come back again! I don't mean to be predictable but obviously I will be ordering the Tuna!"}
{"text":"My boyfriend & I have drove by this restaurant probably a dozen times and finally decided we should try it out. Went to an early dinner on Saturday December 18th. The atmosphere was nice, bar looked very nice with all the bottles lined up as a back drop. We sat in the dining room and ordered a bottle of wine. One good thing about this restaurant is that any server will act like your server. The servers were very helpful overall. We ordered a bottle of Chardonnay and Caprese ($5.99 - Fresh tomatoes, basil and mozzarella cheese in a balsamic reduction) and a side of Israeli Couscous ($2.79 - topped with roasted pistachios) to start. Both were good, the only thing is that the Caprese was 75% tomatoes and 25% mozzarella, I guess that is why it is only $5.99, but it was good. I am a vegetarian so I ordered the Famous Grilled Chicken Salad ($14.89 - Field greens tossed with sliced grilled chicken, goat cheese, toasted almonds, golden raisins, cherry tomatoes and croutons in an aged balsamic vinaigrette drizzled with yogurt sauce) WITHOUT chicken (of course!) and I loved it. I asked for avocados and extra goat cheese to substitute for the chicken and they brought both without charge. My boyfriend got the Rustic Club Sandwich ($10.89 - Marinated turkey, roasted and sliced with smoky bacon, cheddar, lettuce, tomato and mayonnaise on toasted whole wheat bread). His only critique of the sandwich its that it was too heavy to enjoy with the entire meal (apps, wine, dessert) He found himself at the end to be lethargic. Great overall sandwich but a little too heavy for his taste. Even though we were both stuffed we decided to order dessert since that is what this whole restaurant is about...white chocolate! We  ordered White Chocolate Banana Cream Pie ($7.59 - A Graham Cracker and Chocolate Chunk Crust, Fresh Bananas and Vanilla Pastry Cream. With Caramel, Whipped Cream and Shaved White Chocolate) and I was actually expecting it to be really really good. But it was not that tasty, kind of bland. But overall, I would definitely go back to WCG for the wine, apps,and salad! Definitely a 4/5 stars for a nice weeknight meal! :)"}
{"text":"Excellent food and service!!!  We make a point to visit this restaurant at least once a week.  I always order the Famous chicken salad or the French dip but my husband orders many different things on the menu and they are all wonderful.  Dessert is a must!!!  The White chocolate bread pudding is the best bread pudding I have ever had!  The white chocolate brownie is very rich and tasty.  The cheesecake is by far the best cheesecake in the valley.  The only thing I can complain about is they use to serve a coconut cream pie as a special desert and we have not been able to get this is a very long time."}
{"text":"This restaurant is fabulous! We dine in here with another couple at least once a month for the wonderful tomato soup and salad and the great service.  The restaurant is very clean and the atmospheres wonderful!!"}
{"text":"A favorite restaurant of mine.  Never disappointed with the food or the service, always exceptional.  Tried the White Chocolate bread n butter pudding on my visit and was truly delicious!"}
{"text":"I dined here with coworkers and looked forward to a lovely evening after reading several wonderful reviews. They do have a Gluten Free menu that offers several choices. A few of us met in the bar prior to our dinner reservation to enjoy a cocktail before the rest of our team arrived. I had the Flirty Martini which was superb. A coworker had a White Chocolate Martini and was equally satisfied with his choice. We then moved to our dinner table which was out on the patio, and although it was over 90 degrees outside, it was cooler than expected. Our servers catered to our every need, not an easy task when you're serving 16 people.  We ordered numerous appetizers including chips (gluten free) and salsa as well as the egg rolls (I refrained, they are not GF) and shrimp cocktail, which is GF and was scrumptious. For my entree, I ordered the Idaho Rainbow Trout and this is where my expectations fell short. The fish was dry and bland, and sadly the lemon juice and the sauce that came with it did little to help. I will say my mashed potatoes were probably the best I've ever had. And the lemonade I had is made in house and was tasty.  One coworker ordered a salad as her meal but it was brought out well before the rest of our dinners, so that was a bit odd as she felt bad eating when we were still waiting for our meals to arrive.  Would I go back? Maybe, but I would try a steak, as everyone that did said theirs was awesome. A few of my peers ordered the BBQ Trio and that was a hit with all of them."}
{"text":"Appetizers were out quick and tasted excellent. Ordered Dancing Crab Cakes and Fish on special, both were delicious and fresh. Carrots were a super delight and love the sauce, mashed potatoes looked runny but tasted great.  The dessert... well isn't that the reason for coming to this place?! Round of applause for a most tasteful blondie brownie with scrumptious chocolate shavings and ice cream.  This place is always a consistent with menu and flavors."}
{"text":"Amazing White Chocolate Martinis. Starters, the Ahi Tuna appetizer. You have to try the Chicken Crepes. We are told not one of their best but we loved them. Pair them with the spaghetti squash. To die for! Bar service is the best!"}
{"text":"The White Chocolate Grill is a solid restaurant. I prefer it much more than the Keg or the Yard House. Don't get me wrong I like the Yard House, I just like this place better. All of the wait staff I have encountered were excellent. I tend to grow weary of chain restaurants so maybe I am biased if there is only one. Either way I dig this place.  This is how I get down when I am there in case you're one of those who can't decide.  Two to three of the cocktail of your choosing. Grilled Artichokes  Wedge Salad Idaho Trout, or The Blue Cheese Crusted Filet Cup of Coffee Silky Chocolate Soufflé Cake"}
{"text":"This place definitely exceeded my expectations based off fellow yelpers.  We went in about an hour before close, which I typically don't like doing but the hubby insisted. Our server was super friendly & made a lot of suggestions.  The food service was suprisingly slow for us being one of three groups in there, but all of the food came out hot & fresh! For starter we ordered the spinach& artichoke dip which was pretty good. Then I ordered the maytag burger (amazing!) but a little of the salty side (& trust me I love salt) and my husband got the parmesan crusted filet which he devoured.   You CANNOT skip dessert here! He ordered the white chocolate brownie (delicious but suuuuper rich) & I got the white chocolate raspberry cheesecake-- to DIE for!!  Overall it was a good experience & we will be back."}
{"text":"Have been wanting to try this place for ages and finally made the effort. There were 4 of us and items ordered were grilled artichoke (yummy), Caesar salad (very good), chips and salsa. As for main courses Grilled scallop dinner, blackened salmon and shrimp (outstanding) blackened Mahi and ribs and chicken.  All were very tasty.   My only reason for not giving 5 stars was we felt a little rushed. No real down time in between courses. Will definitely go back but will definitely ask them to slow it down a bit.   Also, don't bother with the margaritas. Clearly poured out of a pre-mixed bottle."}
{"text":"Actually this place does not deserve a star especially with poor food, slow service and for managers who make you offers and then rescind on those offers."}
{"text":"Wasn't that thrilled with this admitted knock off of Houstons(opened by former executives) Retarded name first of all, which elicits all kinds of questions.  Completely same interior of Houstons, with exhibition kitchen seen through glass walls.  Service was decent, but food was really lacking.  Had the Balsamic ribeye with mashed potatoes and was disappointed.  Small portion and the portion of mashed potatoes was a joke, maybe two table spoons.  Granted we got in just before closing(which is the time to get the food quality shaft).  Steak tasted okay but it was tiny.  Caesar salad was a 7, Service was an eight, but the menu items we all ordered just weren't spectacular, which I am a firm believer that if an item isn't , take it off the damn menu"}
{"text":"To get more detailed I would give it a 3.7. The highlight of this place are the drinks and desserts. The meals are above average but it wasn't as great as I expected it to be."}
{"text":"I had dinner here for the first time tonight with a couple friends and I was very impressed. The food was very good, but the service was outstanding. Everyone was very attentive and friendly. At one point the manager came to our table to apologize for the wait on our entree (we honestly hand't even noticed) and offered us complimentary dessert. They are doing customer service right over there. The fact they noticed something was not to their standards and offered a solution even though we never complained was above and beyond."}
{"text":"Alright..a first time yelper so not sure what to say but here I go.  It was our first time dining at the restaurant and I''m not quite sure if we'll be going back...  It was a night of sub par service, average food but a really great dessert.  We were turned on by a friend who raved about their Baby Back Ribs with the glazed carrots. So being from the south I can appreciate a nice slab of meat but this was either an off night or my friend has horrible taste.  We were greeted and sat almost immediately to our arrival without a reservation. We were put at a booth for 2 in the bar which wasn't as bad as one might think. The restaurant isn't a loud and rowdy one so a bar atmosphere was very mellow.  But after being sat we didn't get any form of acknowledgment for almost 10 minutes. No water, no hello, nothing.   Finally the server came over and instead of apologizing for the delay, asked if we had any questions with the menu. My date replied with, \" we've actually had enough time to memorize it by now so we're good, thanks!\"  Awkward. :)  To save time we went ahead and ordered our drinks and our dinners in the first go around with the waitress.  We started out with the Ahi Tuna Salad which was amazing, however 5 minutes after we got that, our food came out.  I never understood why restaurants rush food out, especially on a Sunday night.  We're not in a rush so let us enjoy our meal! The meal itself looked great on the plate. Carrots were steaming and the garlic mashed potatoes were plentiful, however cold for both of our entrees.  Unfortunately the waitress never came back to check on us so I had to walk over to the bar and ask the bartender to find her for us.  When she finally came over she tried to take our plates so as she could reheat the meal instead of just bringing us fresh potatoes.  Common sense is lost sometimes on people...  Ok now to a good point!  The white chocolate raspberry cheesecake! Amazing.  Creamy, rich and sweet!  Priced right and calorie free!  Well up until the first bite im sure...   All in all a night of average.  They've lost us for dinner but a dessert and cappuccino is not out of the question here."}
{"text":"The food at White Chocolate was outstanding.  Compliments to the chef(s).  Best burger I've had in a long time and I didn't even eat the bun. The dinner salad was beyond great.  I would have definitely given them 4 stars but they had so many of their people in training that night and it showed with minor mistakes by their food runners. Our actual server was professional and friendly.  All in all, I know where I'm going the next time I'm in town."}
{"text":"My friends and I had some excellent food here tonight!  The Mexican style egg rolls were amazing, and our main entrees: Rainbow Trout, Parmesan crusted filet and a steak sandwhich were also very good. To top it off, we shared the excellent white chocolate brownie and the white chocolate bread pudding, with the pudding being one of the best BPs we've ever had!"}
{"text":"Best food for the buck in north Scottsdale. Always delivers excellent quality and prompt service. Took 15 minutes after our reservation to seat us, but a manager immediately showed up and offered us a free appetizer. That guacamole was great. When we have guests and don't want surprises, we come here."}
{"text":"Had the best BEST time here tonight! My mama and best girlfriends treated to me a fun day for my birthday and I insisted on wrapping up the afternoon with happy hour on me. I've never been but we wanted to go somewhere nice and stopped in.   The restaurant is beautiful- we sat in a high back comfy booth in the bar which is really nice. The bar has shelves of backlit colorful liquor bottles above it (ala the Ocean Club bar). We has 2 rounds, including the Vitamin C martini, White Chocolate Martini, Flirtini and Black Cherry cocktail- they were all really great! We also got the colossal shrimp appetizer (which technically weren't all that colossal, they were just normal), the sliders (the bacon and maytag bleu cheese was amazing!) and the AZ Eggrolls (a bit on the greasy side but very tasty and perfect for happy hour). The tab was only $65 (it was happy hour and the prices averaged about $6/ drink and app). The service was also extremely good.   It's been a long time since I felt like raving about a restaurant- it was great!"}
{"text":"If you're using Yelp to find a restaurant you obviously haven't eaten here - and if you haven't eaten here at least once, you must!  It's not even a burger place, but The Maytag Burger will crush any bacon/blue cheese burger you have ever had.   The Israeli couscous is unusual and excellent. The food is incredibly flavorful but tastes fresh. I HIGHLY recommend to anybody who wants to go somewhere \"new\" with great food and some unique options without going off the deep end into \"crazy-unique\".  Prices are ~$10 - $20 per entree."}
{"text":"First and foremost, the service was fantastic! We were greeted immediately with smiles and kindness! Our waitress was helpful, patient and attentive! Superb!!!  From the bread, to the egg rolls, to the grilled artichoke... the appetizers got me excited for what's coming next!! The only struggle was with the grilled artichoke... deliciousness should not require that much work, but it was still amazing!!   We ordered the Center cut filet with Brussels sprouts salad! So juicy, flavorful and filling. It did not need anything extra, and well-done was grilled to perfection... still tender and melted in your mouth- don't forget to ask for mushrooms!   The Park Avenue New York Strip was covered in delicious mushroom sauce, creating a party flavor in your mouth! Strongly recommend!   The Citrus-Soy Glazed Salmon served with Brussel sprouts salad and honey glazed carrots created an essence of beauty and freshness!   This has officially become my favorite spot!   P.S. don't forget the drinks! Their pomegranate martini and flirtini were amazing! Very strong!   Bon appétit!!!"}
{"text":"We are visiting from Chicago and we're looking for someplace to have dinner. Based on the reviews on Yelp and how close the restaurant is to us we chose White Chocolate Grill.  We were not disappointed. My wife had trout and I had New Orleans Salmon. The trout was cooked perfectly.  My blackened salmon was served with a slightly spicy sauce and two small shrimp all of which was very good. We ordered the white chocolate chesse cake for dessert. This was the best cheesecake we've ever had. I thought their wine was pricey, but we enjoyed the entire experience."}
{"text":"great spot..we live up the road and is our go to restaurant. i've had about everything on the menu and its all awesome..my fave is the citrus soy salmon and the cucumbers they put on the on side are heavenly! During the fall they have the pumpkin cheesecake that will make your tummy very happy. Do yourself a favor and go to WCG!"}
{"text":"Wonderful food and environment. They're bbq ribs are to die for and literally fall off the bone. Can't go wrong here and can't wait to try it again."}
{"text":"This place is so wonderful.  Just went back for the 4th time. They have a $30/person 4 course meal special that is SUCH an amazing value.  The AZ Eggrolls are SO good.  The Bleu Cheese and Parmesan ecnrusted fillets are exceptional both flavor and quality-wise.  I highly recommend the Gin Soup."}
{"text":"This place is on our usual restaurant rotation.  Nice rich woods and modern decor, dimly lit with spot lighting on tables and such....great patio seating with outdoor fireplace. The patio does face busy Scottsdale Rd, but they did a good job of blocking it in.  There's nothing better than sitting outside in Scottsdale when it's nice out.   If you have never been here before, you may mistake this place for a Houston's knockoff (overall feel of restaurant, lighting, menu....) I swore up and down they were sister restaurants, but indeed, they are not.  I still prefer Houston's quality of food/serfvice better, BUT, when it comes to menu selection, price points, ability to make reservations, and THE DESSERTS...WCG wins.    I guess I will start with dessert. OH my...the White Chocolate Banana Cream Pie.... This is soooooo YUMMMM! It can feed at the least 2 people.  It isn'y your 'typical' pie crust...Graham cracker crust filled with fresh bananas and pudding/filling, fesh whipped cream and copious amounts of shaved white chocolate curls....I love it because it isn't overly sweet and heavy.  Which I'm sure is misleading because the graham cracker crust probably has a nice amount of butter in it....MMMMMMMmmmm!  Their dinner for two (should be dinner for 3-4) special is a really great deal under $30 pp will get you 1 app, 2 salads, 2 entrees, 1 dessert.  *note...banana cream pie not available for dessert....BOO   The prime rib is delicious! Juicy, tender, nice flavorful crust. good jus.  They serve it with the horseradish, but I've had better, stonger hoseradish elsewhere...but still great! Definitely a good value and worth ordering.  Ribs are delish as well.  Good flavor...Is it super fall off the bone like Houston's ribs? Not quite, but still very good! These are definitely shareable.   Burgers are good too...  Don't bother ordering the chicken tortilla soup.  It's edible, but it is seriously heavy and not what comes to mind when I want a tortilla soup.  It should be called a chicken enchilada soup. That is EXACTLY what it tastes like, an enchilada. Not bad tasting....just not a tortilla soup.   Crab cakes....MEH....Blah. Good flavor, but cookie cutter, (canned?)  crabcakes. Kind of expected from the price point....lots of filler.  Of course, I am spoiled by Ruth's Chris CRAB cakes, so this may be a bit harsh.  I don't want my crab to look like  canned tuna mince!   The artichoke dip is good too...especially to  munch on at the bar. Nicley backdropped by backlit alcohol bottles arranged by rows and flat screen tvs. Comes with a ton of chips and the salsa it comes with is soo tasty and fresh.  Could totally come from a mexican restaurant.   Make reservations if you don't want to wait...at least a 40 minute wait w/o them...EVEN ON WEEKDAYS! At least there is a nice outdoor seating area complete with yet another fireplace and someone to come by every so often to offer drinks. No waiting at the bar/bar tables, but they fill up quick b/c they do offer a selective happy hour menu.   Over the course of our many visits, we have only had one not so great experience there while having lunch at the bar tables.  I think the gal was new, but we have come back since, and everything was great!  Nobpody's perfect!  We will keep this place on our rotation for sure."}
{"text":"Solid Service, Professional - my experience.  Nice place - love the colorful bar!  I'll agree affordable with vibe of an upscale restaurant.  I Don't hink you can be disappointed on price point.  Pretty good steaks and deserts!   Never been?  GO.  I've had some good times here, I think you will too.  Enjoy."}
{"text":"My second time going to this restaurant. Was in the need for a good burger and received a great burger. They recently added a new corn salad to the menu which was juicy. Finished of the meal with their white chocolate cheesecake. Unlike most cheesecakes, theirs is light and fluffy.   I also think that the service is great. Very attentive and they allow their personalities shine. I like when the staff believes in the restaurant and e food that they serve."}
{"text":"My husband and I sent here some time ago. It's a nice place to go to, although nothing fancy that would make us want to return regularly. The food was good and the drinks were taste. The staff were good. Nothing though \"wow\"ed us."}
{"text":"I had the famous grilled chicken salad and it was one of the best salads I've ever had in my life. The wait staff was attentive and the cocktail I picked (Long Island ice tea) was strong and well mixed. If you're trying to decide between the white chocolate brownie and the apple pie, go with the brownie. Both are good but the brownie is great."}
{"text":"Three cheese dip is a must do appetizer. Had the shredded pork which was more like cutlets - great taste was just surprised with the presentation .. Will revisit for other items that were tempting"}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite places whether I'm dining in or ordering to go. The bar staff here is exceptional & their bar is goegeous! If you haven't tried their white chocolate brownie you're missing out on life!"}
{"text":"White Chocolate Bread Pudding is deelish and the Raspberry Cheesecake is unbelievable! Good lawd!"}
{"text":"Best martini in town with a beautiful shell of ice over the top. Later, server brought me a fresh cold glass. Keeping a martini cold is key and they did not disappoint. My salad was large and filling but did not have anything unusual in it . The service was excellent from start to finish. Food was very good but unremarkable. Typical bar and grill food. Plenty of it and a decent menu. I would go back. Everything was clean and prices were typical of the area."}
{"text":"Favorite place ever. I've gone here quite a bit and every time it's been awesome. There usually isn't a wait during lunch time and I did have to wait only once during dinner time and the wait was only like 15 minutes. The service is great and the employees are always super nice! I was here about two months ago with my family for lunch and our order ticket got lost so the manager nicely came over and told us and said that he would be paying for our lunch. So nice! Shows how nice and how the employees care about their customer service! I always get the \"Spit Roasted Turkey Dip\" and it is awesome! The mashed potatoes are to die for and the mushroom dipping sauce the sandwich comes with is the best thing i've ever tasted! The prices can be a little pricey but it is worth it since the food is great, the service is great and the portions of meals are huge! Definitely will be coming back here a lot for great food!"}
{"text":"We met up with friends for 5pm dinner on Saturday (pre birthday celebration dinner/double date).   We ordered the date night deal. we shared the caprese for our app, For our main entrees I had citrus soy glazed salmon and the hubster had the new york steak medium well. we normally don't order dessert but  it comes with the date night deal. we shared white chocolate brownie..decadent dessert! Our friends both were oohing and ahhing about their white chocolate raspberry cheesecake.  Loved the design and dark wood throughout.  the servers work as a team and they are all friendly. our friends picked up the tab but I would definitely return on our own dime. turned out to be a nice evening, great meals and conversation in a beautiful setting."}
{"text":"I have been dining here for long time and I have to say the customer service is something the be desired as ut us becoming more popular. I made reservations for mothers day and we were sat on the bar at high tops  I was bringing my 90 year old grandma that uses a walker. The manager stated there was nothing he could do. Unacceptable answer!! I had to call and let her know we would have to go to dinner for mother's day another night. Five minutes later he came back and tried to fix but I had already called as this was not suitable for her. The food is great but when you receive bad service not worth it!"}
{"text":"Had high expectations and im starting to think I sometimes go in expecting to much. Don't get me wrong, its a nice place. Nice dark and comfy ambiance. they were out of the artichoke appetizer we wanted, we tried the spinach dip and it was pretty good. I had the salmon, and it was very tasty. The glaze they   put on it was fantastic, and our waiter told us their salmon dish also has won several awards. Lover tried the snapper special and he enjoyed it a well. Overall everything was pretty good and the bread pudding is a must as well!  P.s put in a reservation online. We showed up and we were seated right away.."}
{"text":"Overpriced and the food quality is not that good. I have been sick twice after eating at this place. There are definitely better options around."}
{"text":"We have dined at WCG about 20 times in the past and it has usually been a consistently good experience, regarding service and quality of food. Fast forward to tonight.....our 7th anniversary.  Hubby says lets go celebrate at WCG.. Usually this would be an instant YES....but after our last visit there, I am reluctant and hesitant to go, but willing to give it another try................. Wait staff is always excellent and attentive.  We always order the same meal.  Mine is Salmon (perfectly grilled salmon)... Hubby is French dip sandwich with fries.  I order a 1/2 salad this time and broccoli ...al dente' which I have to explain to the watiress is just barely cooked and crisp (after a blank stare when I say Al dente'). Dinner is served...............no salad, and the broccoli is overcooked and mushy, with way too much seasoning and not acceptable.  Salmon is getting smaller and smaller each visit as is hubby's sandwich which is the incredible shrinking machine, along with miniscule fries that used to be heaping!! Hello waitress.............the broccoli is not acceptable and with apologies, another order of broccoli appears by another server we have never seen before.  The difference in what was served with the fish and the plate brought out is huge!!  I ask to see the manager because the difference is worth noting.   She agrees with our issues and apologizes as well as agreeing it was not up to standards. We finish our meal and the waitress approaches and acknowledges our anniversary and offers a desert.  We refuse as we were not planning on having desert and were full.  She brings us the bill and they have taken off the dinner, only charging for the drinks.  Now we feel guilty as we told the manager we did not expect anything other than knowing we could come here and have a great consistent dinner as we have experienced in the past.  We pay the bill and tip for the full amount.  Waitress is busy and possibly avoiding us?  Not sure, but feeling pretty uncomfortable by now. Will we come back.... hmm, good question.... I guess trying for the third time is the charm type of thing is what we will strive for, but at this moment, not too sure. Question????  Why is it so difficult to have quality control in the kitchen??  Maybe if the person taking the order would also serve the food, they could make certain the order was filled properly and the customer was satisfied.  That might help.   Like I said before, the service has always been good, Just wish the quality of the food would remain what it has been in the past."}
{"text":"Been here a few times and each time I was disappointed. In full transparency, I absolutely love Houston's and this place is an obvious ripoff of them, but not held to the same standards. The things I usually get at Houston's are the cheeseburger, the famous French dip and various appetizers; when I tried the same items here they were off, each of the visits so it's not like it was an isolated issue. If you've been here and haven't tried Houston's, do yourself a favor and go there. Afterwards, let me know if you agree with me."}
{"text":"This time the WCG burger was nicely charred on the outside but inconsistent in between. Portions were medium rare while other portions were darned close to raw. The meat was not seasoned at all. The burger meat itself hadn't been completely compressed as it was still possible to see the strands of the meat just as it had come out of the grinder - a bit off-putting. The fries were similarly a mix of nearly raw to overly crisp.  The New York Strip steak was the thinnest piece of steak I've seen in years. It was properly cooked. But, this was a lifeless, uninspired dish. Definitely not \"steakhouse quality.\"  Neither was truly \"send back\" worthy. But, this place isn't \"go back\" worthy, either.  The white chocolate bread pudding was the star of the night. That, and the server staff were all very friendly and reasonably quick."}
{"text":"I have to lawyer up a little early in my review this time...http://tinyurl.com/4julqg  Do you miss the simple, twisted genius of Warren Zevon, too?  At any rate, to fully disclose,  I know the owner of WCG personally and businessally...You'll just have to trust me when I tell you that this didn't shade my review...in fact quite the opposite...I have been sitting on this for a while...trying to figure out how write this without sounding like a shill!  Then I thought, \"Well, Donald, everyone is still entitled to my own opinion\" so here we go!  WCG is one of my favorite places in the Greater Phoenix Area for a number of reasons:  * The menu is so varied, creative and well executed...everything from the Mesquite Grilled Artichokes to the Roasted Chicken to the Filet Mignon Cobb Salad and my favorite, the Maytag Burger (more about that in a minute) is well prepared and delicious  * The service has always been first rate (and I have to say that I expected that when the server is aware that I am friends with Bobby, but there are ton of people there that don't know me from Tyler Florence and we still get great service!)  * Extraordinary care in the preparation of the food, from the grinding of the beef for my burger to the grilling of the artichokes and the construction of the puff pastry crust Apple Pie for desert...they pay incredible attention to detail  * The atmosphere and ambience remind me (and not by accident) of one of my Northern California favorites, the Rutherford Grill...all cherry tones, leather and soft lighting...it always puts me in a great mood and compels me to eat more than I should  Today was no different...The Beautiful Carin and I stopped in for a lunch meeting to discuss our business, our branding, goal setting for the company (is world domination within 48 months too lofty a goal?) and what not (I set foot in this Northern California inspired place and I start to sound like Ah-nold again and so forth).  For my lunch, I had one of the best burgers in town...the Maytag Burger...they grind the meat on the premises, daily, fresh...no kidding!  For the \"Maytag\" portion of this earthly delight, they bake and crumble the bacon into the Maytag Bleu Cheese (notice my fancy French spelling there...merci') and form it into a disk of cheese and bacon that they drop onto the burger a few seconds before it's done and voila'...the best bacon/bleu cheese burger around...bacon and cheese in every bite...genius!  Carin has her favorites, too...the Filet Mignon Cobb Salad is one, as is the Spit Roasted Chicken and some of the best Crab Cakes you'll find west of Baltimore.  I smile every time I walk into WCG...I smile even more (and I usually burp a little, too) when I walk out after another great meal!  But don't take my word for it (another disclaimer to end my review on the right note)...go see for yourself...and try the Apple Pie...you'll be happy you did (and quite possibly burping in delight, as well)."}
{"text":"Great place to take company. A decent variety on the menu. And the food is good. Expect to pay for the area it is located in. The one reason I didn't give it 5 stars is because I wish they had more choices on their dessert menu. Plus we were not asked if we wanted dessert. The server brought the bill and we felt like it was time to get out. So we didn't order dessert and left. Their loss. Never assume. Always ask."}
{"text":"This is a great place, let me say that first, right off the bat. My companions and I had to wait about 10-15 min for a table during a busy lunch hour. Was it worth the wait? You bet. My companions and myself had a burger, the French Dip and I believe some kind of BBQ. Let me say they all looked delicious. I can only comment from personal experience on the French Dip as my dinning partners liked theirs so much no offers of a taste were forthcoming. The French Dip was quite a mouthful. Crusty bread with layer after layer of tender roast beef stacked and packed. The aus jus could have had a little more bite to it but everyone has differing tastes when it comes to the Dip in the French Dip. It was quite tasty and came with matchstick fries. They reminded me of the kind you can get in a can in the grocery stores but fresh. The decor is quite attractive. Rather dark with pools of light around the tables and bar area, making for quite a contrast to the blinding light of lunch time Scottsdale. In addition to the attractive dinning area, there is a bar that although I spent no time in, looked fantastic. An oversight to be corrected next visit. Did I enjoy it? Yes. Will I go back? Of course."}
{"text":"This is my absolute favorite place. I have never had a complaint about any of their food or service until last night (I have been going here for dinner for about 3 years now). I ordered the parmesan crusted filet and when it came out there was no parmesan on it so the waitress took it back to the kitchen and had the chef put the parmesan on. By the time it got back to me my fries and mashed potatoes where about cold. The manager was the one to bring me my meal and he apologized for the mistake. I said it was fine and thought nothing of it; when the check came I saw that my meal was complimentary. I love them and will continue coming back!!"}
{"text":"I've only been here one other time and that was for lunch. We had dinner with some friends on a Wednesday evening and it was amazing. The service was excellent the food was great. It is a little bit noisy in the main dining room but not too terrible.  We usually dine at the bar. The whole restaurant was very busy for a Wednesday evening in early August.  Parking lot is tight and was full!!   There were four of us and we each ordered a different salad. Ahi Tuna Salad and the Miami Beach shrimp salad were amazing!! We all four 'tasted' the key lime pie from dessert! It was delicious.  The shrimp on my salad were a bit 'mealy' but not enough to send back."}
{"text":"I suggested to the man that we go out to WCG as I had been there once before.  Shane made a reservation for 9:00 pm which was convenient as we are late eaters from time to time.  We were greeted and seated very quickly.  The atmosphere is very dark and intimate, very nice for any couple or date.  Our waitress greeted us with a smile and was very knowledgeable of the menu.  I have to say that this place serves one of the BEST Pork Tenderloins I have ever eaten.  The meat is so tender you could cut it with a fork and it came with a very complimentary apricot glaze and mashed potatoes.  Shane had a stake and a few mohitos and I had a pomegranate martini both were equally fantastic.  In all we both had our entrees, an appetizer, desert, and 4 drinks for under $100.00."}
{"text":"My lady and I keep coming back here. I can't get enough of the Atlantic salmon with Israeli couscous. The white chocolate brownie for dessert is the best way to finish a meal. We come in sometimes just for that brownie."}
{"text":"WCG has become my go to place to bring business customers. Over the years, I have learned the key to a good business dinner/lunch is A.) Great service B.) Good energy, yet not to loud environment C.) Food that leaves a memory.  This place checks all the boxes without being too fancy and over priced.  Keep up the good work WCG!!"}
{"text":"My husband and I decided that our son had been salivating long enough about the food at the restaurant where he works part-time and decided it was time to treat him for a meal there. Well, it was definitely a treat, but for all of us. It is one of the best restaurants I have gone to (and my husband who takes clients out all the time agreed). Everything from the crusted ahi tuna appetizer, to the sides (Brussel sprout/almond/raisin slaw, mashed potatoes, roasted carrots, and couscous), to the sea bass, New York Steak, BBQ Ribs (best I've had ever), and the desserts (we split the white chocolate brownie and the most amazing key lime pie ever).   We shared all and every single thing was awesome. Plus the service was wonderful and the atmosphere was great. They were hopping busy on a Wednesday night and now that I've eaten there, I can understand why. I highly recommend it for a special occasion or just to treat yourself for no good reason.  PS Get a piece of key lime pie to take home. Oh my God! The perfect tart/sweet balance. It was just as good the next day! Heavenly."}
{"text":"This place is my in laws favorite go to place so they always want to meet us here. The place is very nice and my husband normally gets there ribs and I get there chicken salad. Food and service is excellent. And they do have a big selection of deserts."}
{"text":"Returned today for the Tomato soup and WCG salad lunch.  Was disappointed in both.  Had dines there about 4 weeks ago and the above was delicious.  Not so this time.  The soup was lukewarm at best and the salad had too much dressing which had more acid than last time and there were far less pecans in the salad.  The pecans would have cut the excessively agressive dressing.  If ordering this, order the dressing on the side and hope for the best.  Would recommend this restaurant with the above note. Will I return?  Most likely.  My companion had French Dip and fries, this meal was met with success."}
{"text":"I'm not sure what the hype is here.... The service was very decent, but the food both my husband and I had was terrible. I ordered a medium rare steak which came out very well done, although I'm not sure proper  temperature could have saved the bland piece of meat they brought out. I had broccoli on the side and if was also completely over poked and mushy so I didn't eat it. I would have told our server to please redo my steak, but she didn't come to our table until about 40 minutes after our food came out.   Mediocre food is one thing, but expensive mediocre food just makes me mad. We would never go back and certainly wouldn't recommend this place."}
{"text":"I wish I could say I've tried everything on the menu here but unfortunately, I keep going back to some absolute favorites that I can't get away from.  The Famous Grilled Chicken Salad, Classic French Dip, Spit Roasted Turkey Dip are all pretty freakin' amazing.  Notice their menu starts with dessert too...I mean the place is called WCG anyways right?  The White Chocolate Brownie, Bread Pudding, and Fresh Baked Apple Pie are all choices that are going to make you wish you had stronger will power.  But we know you don't...neither do I!!  Bottom line...it's pretty hard to go wrong with anything on the menu!  See if you can guess how many bottles are behind the bar too!  The person least closest has to buy dinner!"}
{"text":"The management style is outstanding. This is a very well run exceptionally busy dining room. We had a nice dinner tonight. I had crab cakes, my friends had chicken crepes and trout. We all enjoyed our meals. Plates and glasses were cleared away and allowed us to enjoy our conversation. Waitress forgot an item we ordered, no problem. This appears to be a very popular, local restaurant. It is in a great location, easily accessible and plenty of parking."}
{"text":"Had a lunch here today and it was good! It's a bit of a senior scene but, the bar is really pretty and nicely done. I originally ordered the pulled pork sandwich and fries but unfortunately the pork was really really dry and over done I sent it back and ordered the club sandwich! It was really good but, far from a healthy club. It has a nice coating of butter on the bread but was good. I had the fries and honey mustard as my side! Best HONEY MUSTARD ever! We ordered a side of the  brussels sprouts to try and they were surprisingly really sweet and toasted. My table also ordered the Miami salad and the Cajun chicken which they enjoyed. I definitely would go back but, obviously not for the atmosphere because like I said it was very senior... But for the great service and for a side of those fries with honey mustard! I think it may have a different feel at night? It did give off a Houstons-esk vibe."}
{"text":"I came here for a second time and had a great lunch with my family. The Spilt Roasted Turkey Dip was super tasty and I recommend. My two sons who are really picky loved the Mac and cheese and Cheeseburger. The waiter was great and very attentive. Overall, a great experience and I would love to come back. The management went above and beyond to make up for my birthday dinner and I really appreciated it."}
{"text":"Service was ok...but kind of disappeared during main entree portion. Nevertheless, good team overall.  Steak was not done to request and it was around average."}
{"text":"Omg, the food here is ridiculously amazing! I had the blue cheese crusted filet mignon and I'm hooked! Our server, Hannah, was icing on the cake! She was SO friendly, patient, knew the menu well and had excellent recommendations! Thank you for a wonderful lunch experience, this is my new local favorite!!"}
{"text":"Atmosphere is nice. Very popular restaurant, a lot of people were waiting on Friday night. Waiters are all nice! Entree is OK. Dessert is fantastic!!"}
{"text":"Okay so this is my second time dining here with a year in between and let me tell you, I went way too long to get here again! My dining experience was actually even more better the second time around mostly because of our lovely and very friendly waitress Michelle! I dined here with my family for my birthday treat and there was a lot of us and Michelle was very attentive and patient with us all. And of course, the food, drinks, and desserts were delicious. I ordered the New Orleans Salmon which had a spice to it, but not a heavy spice taste. It was so very good and my picky 7 year loved it as well. I orders the White Chocolate Martini which was very tasty as well, but of course very sweet as well lol. Last but not least, I ordered the white chocolate banana pie and it was awesome! I cannot wait to go back and try more menu items"}
{"text":"My girlfriend and I went here for dinner last night and it was amazing. We both got the full rack of ribs and the meat falls right off the bone!   We ended our meal with the white chocolate brownie that was also to die for. I give this place a 5/5!!"}
{"text":"I worked here when they first opened and would eat their food on my break every day. Now about 4 or 5 years later, whenever I'm in town I MUST make a stop. Filet Mignon cobb salad and the white chocolate brownie are my go-to's, but the tortilla soup. the french dip, the turkey dip, just EVERYTHING is amazing. Wish there was one in Santa Monica, but then again I'd be broke and overweight if there was..."}
{"text":"3.75 *'s rounded up to 4.   Had a 2 hour late-lunch business meeting with a client here. It was nice and quiet at 4... but the noise was roaring when we left around 6pm.   White Chocolate Grill... like others, I wasn't sure what to expect from the name. I was thinking maybe like Cheesecake Factory or something?? But it was a nice, upscale restaurant with so many different entree choices to probably please everyone.   There were salads, sandwiches, entrees, and steaks.   I chose to go with the Rotisserie Chicken Crepes, with mushrooms and a madeira sauce. It was good... not out of this world unbelievable, but it was good. For my side I chose the honey carrots, per all the recommendations here on yelp.   Oh, for starters I had the house salad w balsamic dressing. It was great!  My colleague had a soup and chicken enchiladas -- she said both were good.   And we both had white chocolate brownies to go! They packed whipped cream, white chocolate shavings, chocolate sauce,. AND vanilla bean ice cream in our to-go containers. It was AWESOME! (My husband appreciated that I actually brought him leftovers.)  Service was not as good as the food. It was pretty spotty. But that's alright.... the white chocolate brownie made up for it."}
{"text":"We shared the Sesame Crusted Ahi Tuna starter which was quite good, and after that I had a quite amazing Caesar Side Salad.  For the entree I went for the Barbecued Baby Back Ribs which are described as Tender-smoked, fall-off-the-bone pork ribs grilled and finished with signature BBQ sauce -- and yes, they were just that. I cannot say they are the best I have ever had, but if they are not, they are certainly a close enough runner not to be able to tell.  For dessert we had to sample what the place seems to be named for: the White Chocolate Brownie and it was indeed amazing.  Beyond the food, however, was the service -- it really was one of the best places we have been to. Our waiter was extremely knowledgeable about the menu and the support staff that catered to the table were quick and efficient but no where close to annoying. I will probably pass on the ribs next time not because they were bad but rather because there are other things I am longing to try in one of the best places we have been to during our visit to Scottsdale."}
{"text":"Wow, above and beyond.  Thank you Ashley aka AJ, for caring about us with a smile...  thank you Mr. John (GM) who took care of a minor thing that most restaurants would have over looked...     This place gets service like most don't.  And the Salads are killer BTW  Cheers,MJB"}
{"text":"My colleague suggested to check this place out for our client lunch. Wow the menu looks amazing. I went with the suggested salad which was filet mignon and I was not disappointed. Yummy!!! We also shared the grilled artichoke was super good too. Great service who kept refilling my Arnold Palmer's. I definitely will be back next time I am in town! I am a fan!!"}
{"text":"Another five star lunch. I had today's special-2 grilled chicken tacos wide a side of spaghetti squash seasoned with Basil butter and adorned with golden raisins and pistachios. I never choose veggies over a carb loaded side but these were light and fresh. Seamless service and sways consistently good food."}
{"text":"Great food and service.  They really dim down the lights.  You can barely see what you're eating."}
{"text":"Fries, house salad, Israeli couscous. Not a huge choice here for vegetarians, but still plenty so I didn't go hungry. And there's always dessert!  That was the extent of my meal here but it was all good, especially the couscous salad. The waitress was very attentive and friendly, keeping our waters topped off. I would come sometime just for the dessert."}
{"text":"I came here on the fourth of July with 3 other friends for happy hour. It was packed and busy.   This place has a casual feel but it's also classy at the same time because they dim their lights. It's definitely not a sports bar, it's classy than that.   +Happy hour starts @ 2pm and ends at 7pm - Great time!  +Cheap food and drinks   Our waiter was very nice and came back to check on us in terms of drinks and food.   We shared fries, the sliders and the egg rolls (the waiter recommended the egg rolls). The fries remind me of shoe string fries and those are delicious! Good fries with lots of different types of dipping sauce. I personally like the 'ranch,' it had more flavor to it than typical ranch dressing. My friend like the BBQ sauce that came with it. The fries are good.  The sliders and egg rolls are nothing spectacular. They're good but not amazing. I feel like the sliders and egg rolls remind me of items they also sell at TGIF or some other chain restaurant. - Overall, it's not bad.  +Come for the happy hour!"}
{"text":"If you're looking for a delicious meal with great service eat at White chocolate Grill. Ask for Michelle as your server.  She and her support staff are most attentive and professional. Make sure to make a reservation."}
{"text":"Very nice place.  Prices are not outrageous considering they type of place it is.  The only thing they are sorely lacking on is really good salads.  They all seem to have have the same \"field greens and cherry tomatoe\" theme to them with slight variations added items.  The cesar is \"real\" with all the correct and authentic ingredients. The other entres where very nicely presented and flavor nice.  Nice place to relax over a few drinks."}
{"text":"Love this place. They have been consistently great for many years. Be prepared for a long wait on the weekend, but their bar is comfortable if you choose to dine there. Grilled Salmon with broccoli was exceptional, and the Southern chicken salad with honey mustard dressing was incredible. My husband love the cheese burger.   Always good.. I highly recommended it!"}
{"text":"The White Chocolate Grill is like a more upscale, local version of a Cheesecake Factory. The menu is huge, so there should be something for everyone, but the food itself is not very good. We have tried various appetizers, including the AZ egg rolls, guacamole and chips, and Brussels sprouts, which were all mediocre. The entree portions are huge and while the barbecue has been pretty good, the fish entrees have fallen short. Neither the service nor food make me want to return but the food at least is safe to eat."}
{"text":"Made our way here last night for my Birthday Dinner.  THANK GOD.  I have been looking for a restaurant like this since I left Chicago 5 years ago.  The style was perfect, the prices were not exorbitant, the food was delicious, the service was tremendous.  We had a table at 7, and even though we Happy Hour had passed, they still let us order off of the happy hour menu, so we had four courses for $30 a piece.  We started with Spinach Artichoke DIp, each had a salad (I had the Bacon/Bleu Cheese/Walnut - YUM), then I had the Balsamic Ribeye...  It was so delicious.    One complaint, half of my steak was medium, a quarter was rare, and the other quarter was practically blue, but it still tasted great.  Oh - and the carrots were a little too sweet for me...  They tasted like sweet potatoes....  Anyway...  For dessert we had the bread pudding which was the best damned bread pudding I have ever had.  Add in the drinks (which were tasty) and our bill was still nothing too crazy.  Our server was just the right combination of hands off and hands on, and i dug her big time.  We ended up having a long leisurely meal, were there from 7-9, but it didn't feel like we were there a long time.  It was just a nice relaxing meal...  Loved it - best restaurant experience I've had since I moved here three years ago.  Can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"Fantastic food and service. They made the steak too well and we ordered something else. Guess what? They comped it! Unheard of and especially nice! Can't wait to return. A special place!!"}
{"text":"My girlfriend and I love this place. Great atmosphere, service and food. The bar is really cool looking. I have never had anything less than outstanding service.   My girlfriend always gets the balsamic infused rib eye and I can't blame her. It is really good. I like to try different things, but my fall back is always the Maytag crusted fillet. I like that they have interesting specials too. the best was a special vegetable side. Buttered mint green beans sounded odd to me, so I had to try it. I am glad I did because they were awesome.   Great place to take a date."}
{"text":"this place has horrible service!! management is not kind or reasonable!! the service is what makes this place is what makes it a bad experience... I would recommend McDonald's up the street over this place... seriously or go to The Capitol grill..."}
{"text":"This place he a nice vibe and the menu is diverse and priced well. I dined alone and sat at the bar. Thought they had a nice set up for the bar booths- definitely a great place to watch a game and dine.   I ate the seabass- it was not par to my expectations. I'm used to thick sea bass filets and this was closer to trout filet. I did indulge in the Apple pie which was yummy! Its more of a tart considering the way they presented the crust but it was still really good!"}
{"text":"WCG has been our favorite place for awhile. Menu choices are great. Never been disappointed and staff is very accommodating. The tall gentleman behind bar enjoys mingling with bar guests as he is constantly staying busy. This is a great stop for lunch, HH or dinner!"}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite places to eat, especially as someone with an intolerance to gluten.  They have a whole gluten free menu with wonderful selections.    The first time I went there was right before Thanksgiving so they had a gluten free pumpkin pie as well as their regular gluten free chocolate dessert.  Our server brought me a piece on the house.  I was so happy I almost cried.  Pumpkin pie is something I was really sad I couldn't have (my mother later found a great GF recipe for pie crust and whipped up one for me, but I didn't know this at the time) and he was so sweet to bring me some for free when I had a hard time deciding which dessert to try.    I try to venture out on the menu, but I always end up with the babyback ribs because they're SO delicious.  The mashed potatoes have nutmeg in them and are to die for.  The shoestring fries are really good too.  The honey glazed carrots are also tasty.  Everything I've had has been top notch.  They've got it all at WCG-great food, great drinks, great desserts, great atmosphere, and great service.    The wait can be long but you may be able to make reservations; I'm not sure, as I've never tried.    The patio is even nice in the Winter if it's not TOO cold (which, in this part of AZ, it typically isn't), because it's mostly walled in and has heat lamps.      You can dress up or down and it's appropriate either way, but I guess if I had to pick, it's on the nicer side probably.  You won't feel out of place in jeans, however."}
{"text":"I need to per-qualify this rating by saying that I'm rating this off one dish. Unlike other posts here our server was very respectful and nice.  OK, let's get to it. I had the chicken Madeira. I cook a fabulous chicken Madeira but when I go to a classy place such as this I expect to be wowed. The anticipation was great as the build up came from the surroundings of such a modern restaurant with a very balanced darkness which completed the experience with atmosphere lighting.  You certainly felt upscale. Seeing the rest of my party being served certainly had an impact as their orders were very visually appealing. However, when I was served I found their chicken Madeira leaves a lot to be desired. It was definitely  a let down from first sight which unfortunately continued until the last uneventful bite.  The sauce was bland and not seasoned at all and carried none of the tastes you would expect from such a dynamic dish. While the sauce required more flavor for sure, the three chicken pieces I received were so small I almost laugh out loud, but managed to keep it under my breath. The only thing salvageable were the homemade French fries which I'm convinced you can't really mess that up having deep fried many homemade fries myself.  Didn't justify the $17.00 charge.. no way.    Just saying... stay clear of this dish..."}
{"text":"I took a customer here who recommended we meet there last week and the food was awesome.  I decided to go there again today for lunch with my coworker as I was driving by. Both of our meals came out cold, so we politely asked if they could simply microwave it or heat it up; because it tasted good to both of us. I was a bit disappointed, since I talked it up, but our meal came back hot and tasty!  We didn't complain or bit$h at anyone, but thanked them for correcting their error. Well - the whole meal was on them. Unexpectedly they took care of us financially without asking.  I wish we had more cash, but together we only had $10 cash to tip them on a $45 bill. I would have given them $20 for being so kind. It's not often that businesses get reviews for treating customers well. Thanks a lot Kai and whoever the manager/s were. I'll be back again."}
{"text":"Having to ask 4 times for water is never a good sign. Its also not great when your food is delivered after the two tables next you who actually sat down after you ordered already... Seriously, this was bad.    Mediocre food, poor service and a manager that just didn't care... Bad combo. I won't be back"}
{"text":"Yes, I have experienced better. My hubby and I decided to try happy hour and chose The White Chocolate Grill.   Plain and to the point it was a very expensive Happy Hour.   We had two drinks each and ordered one appetizer - spinach artichoke dip and chips.   Our bill was $36.00.  FOUR drinks and ONE appetizer and with the tip it was well over 40.00 for a happy hour out, not a dinner but a happy hour.  The dip was average, nothing special.  First and last time going there.  If you want to spend your money for nothing then this is the place for you!!!    Average at best."}
{"text":"A perfect place to go for an evening out.  Interesting food, great atmosphere and excellent service make it a place I would go back to."}
{"text":"My favorite restaurant! Great ambience! Our waitress was very friendly and attentive. We had a party of five very high maintenance women and she handled the table like pro! We were celebrating  my birthday so I was able to choose a dessert. I chose the white chocolate brownie and YUM!! My favorite dish is the filet mignon Cobb salad. The best salad ever. I could eat here every week."}
{"text":"Always good food and attentive (too much) service. Had lunch there today. My friend and I laughed over the almost aggressive manner in which all staff members attempted to clear dishes from our table. We had shared the FANTASTIC Tomato Gin Soup, and had a bit left in the bowl to enjoy. At least 5 employees came by and tried to take it. Finally, we practically bit the last girl's hand off. Don't they know they shouldn't clear until ALL people at the table are done eating? The team system of serving/ busing tables may not always work well. At the end of our meal, we couldn't GET anyone's attention, probably because we'd overstayed our welcome (lots to chat about).  Anyway, the soup I mentioned above was truly craveable - maybe the best thing I've put in my mouth all year."}
{"text":"Excellent service and food.  The \"Perfectly Grilled Salmon\" lived up to its billing.  The White Chocolate Banana Cream Pie was also very good.  We would come here again."}
{"text":"Talk about great food and service.  My BF and partner came here and we were all surprised by how great the food and staff was.  The service  was quick and spot on.  The food was to die for.  Great place to eat and relax check out the patio."}
{"text":"This has to be one of my favorite restaurant in north Scottsdale. I've been coming here for few years now and the food is consistently good and service impeccable.  As you walk in, the hostess seats you and if you're wearing dark clothing, she will swap out the white cloth napkins to a black one.  I've tried almost everything on the menu over the years and never had a bad meal. Their jambalaya is amazing; comes with giant shrimps. Their salads are so delicious as well. It's amazing how juicy the chicken on their salad is. My favorite is the kale and spinach salad and ahi tuna salad. My son always goes for their BBQ ribs or their burgers. Both juicy and delicious. The meat just falls off the bones.  Did I mention dessert? Omg! Their bread pudding is to die for. It come out warm. It's a must when eating here.  The staff is amazing too. They never let your water go half empty without refilling. The dirty dishes get taken away immediately.  Only downside of eating here is that it gets crowded during peak hours and wait can be as long as over an hour. If you don't have reservation, the trick is to call before leaving the house. They will put your name on the wait list without being there. Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Great food. Great bartenders and great Happy Hour."}
{"text":"Tonight, everything was great! Service was excellent. Side of carrots was worth mentioning; great flavor, texture and consistency.  Soup (with a bit of rum), flavorful but not salty, and caprese was good to the last spoon/bite.  The Atlantic salmon with a side of rice was not dry and pairing was perfect. And of course the French white chocolate bread puddling is always a great ending!"}
{"text":"I normally review either outstanding or terrible places and don't review the in the middle places. This place has an opportunity to improve and should try. It's not terrible but it's very mediocre. Wouldn't return. So here is my review: 1. I wonder if the executive chef has tasted the menu lately. I wonder if the GM ever leaves his office. Was expecting authentic great cooking but the place is a factory...in fact that's exactly what it reminded me of, cheesy Cheesecake Factory. We ordered the tomato gin soup and the tortilla soup. The tomato gin soup was good but I am virtually certain the mushrooms came from a can (they were rubbery). The tortilla soup was delicious but why so little? The Bowl had maybe 1/2 cup at best. We ordered the 1/2 BBQ ribs and 1/2 BBQ chicken. In a world of fierce competition for delicious BBQ, it was flat and disappointing. Sauce was flavorless, and the chicken had been made hours or days in advance. Very unimpressive, moreover the ribs were burned and the sauce dried out. I think they are either cooking well in advance and rewarming or it's cooked in a factory somewhere. Finally, with a name like \"White Chocolate Grill\" we expected a killer desert menu. So ho-hum we skipped. Graham crackers really? Why not just spray whipped cream in a pie plate and drop strawberries in it and call it pie? This is not desert it's childish, insulting and assembly-line. So where is the white chocolate??? Dennys has better desert - much better. And cheaper. 2. Ambience is not much. Very noisy place. Handing out buzzers when you check in soooo cheesy and corporate. 3. Greeters and servers were nice. However, our entree was brought to us literally 30 seconds after our soup. Wrong in any event and especially when we specifically asked for time between courses. 4. What's with the bums rush? :45 from being seated to being served and leaving. Great if you have a plane to catch. Not a date or special event place at all, not with that kind of rush. Again screams factory, move em in move em out. Moooooo! 5. Don't charge restaurant prices for factory assembled Pre-made and reheated food that lacks inspiration and flare. Other then that, it was great...I highly recommend it for anyone who likes mediocrity at high prices."}
{"text":"L.O.V.E. this place.  The food is always just how you want it, and the service is even better.  My 5th time coming here over a period of 3 years (out of town visit) and it's consistently fantastic.  I had their menu-provided Manhattan and mid-way through my enjoyment of this perfectly made drink, the server comes over with a frosty martini glass, pours what I had left into the new glass, \"Gotta enjoy this one cold!\"  Such great attention to detail and care of their patrons.  My wife's scallops were delightful, my 8oz fillet mignon was perfectly prepared.  Make sure to try their WCG Chop Salad (I think it's a lunch menu item, but they'll serve it at dinner if asked).  I can't even describe it.  Just get it--it's great!  Make a reservation, I've seen it pretty busy here!  Thanks, WCG!"}
{"text":"Simply delicious!!! My boyfriend and I are fans of the White Chocolate Grill! I ordered the chicken crepes with mushrooms cream and honey carrots...it was a dream! Then I had a marvelous white chocolate raspberry cheesecake, my boyfriend helped me eating it...it was big and very rich! As cherry on top we had two spiced rum iced tea (good stuff). Our waitress was nice and attentive, she recommended the cheesecake (good choice). I also like this place for the intimate atmosphere...just perfect for me and my partner!! Hihi fabulous!! :-)"}
{"text":"Had a really nice dinner here. I started with an Old Fashioned (not the specialty one on their menu, just a regular one) and it was amazing. This was the best part of my experience. Then came a field green salad which was very good. There was just a tiny bit too much dressing in my opinion but my wife thought it was a good amount. Our daughter had grilled chicken and sliced avocado. The chicken was very flavorful and the avocado was perfectly ripe. I ordered the BBQ Trio with a side of brussel sprouts. The BBQ was great, the b.sprouts were just okay but I did like how they put Craisins in the b.sprouts. Nice touch, different. My wife ordered the chicken crepes which were delicious. She had the couscous on the side which was just okay. Then we all shared the white chocolate brownie which my wife and daughter loved, but I felt was too sweet. I wish I had tried the cheesecake instead. Parking was easy. The staff were super nice. The appearance of the place was very nice. Would definitely come back."}
{"text":"Went for lunch and the service is always good and food very consistent and plentiful. Salads are huge and tasty. My favorite is the WCG Best and the ahi tuna. But they also have good burgers and a great French dip. There are so many choices on the menu, so there is certainly something for everyone. It is helpful to make reservations since it is always busy and you can make them on Open Table. It is very similar in style and menu as a Houston's."}
{"text":"The AZ Egg rolls were perfect. Grilled Chicken Madeira was a treat to my taste buds. Very large portion, I had to take most of it home, so my friend and I could split the White Chocolate Banana Cream Pie.   The ambiance was wonderful. Perfect for a happy hour or just to catch up with friends. If you are going alone, appetizers and dessert will fill you up."}
{"text":"If I could do ZERO stars, I would. Tried to order a measly soufflé cake to go before they closed - I know that it's already prepared and would take no time at all. And by the way, did I mention they were still open???? Jess told me that she \"could not allow the kitchen to prepare anything\" for me. So inhospitable. I live in the area, so I'm crossing this one off my list - I won't be back ever. Such a shame because I went here a lot for the Salmon New Orleans and a soufflé cake. Oh well. There's plenty of other places to go."}
{"text":"Wow! Took my out-of-town guests here for lunch. We scored big! It was an amazing experience with great food and atmosphere. A tad bit too dark inside for me and it is a bit pricey $$$ but it did not affect the wonderful experience. Great service. The bread pudding was excellent. I have pictures of the great food if I can figure out how to upload to Yelp.  This is a must try for all.  Enjoy!"}
{"text":"It was a good experience, only because we were smart enough to get a reservation while the car auction was going on nearby.  My meal was very good, ribs/chicken/pork combo.  My friend got the pork sandwich and her pork was not the same or nearly as good as was in my combo.  The prices were a bit high is all.  Pinnacle Peak Patio has as good BBQ food and for half the price.  I wouldn't go here again unless my snooty friend wanted to again. ."}
{"text":"We've been to White Chocolate Grill two or three times before this visit. I like the ambiance and I love the food. They have a nice selection to satisfy the vegetarians  and carnivores in my family. The latest visit, however, prompted my us to never return.  We made a reservation on the patio since the inside tables for a party of five were already booked. They said the patio was heated and has a fireplace. Great!   On arrival, we were seated underneath a spinning ceiling fan next to an idle heater. The waitress tried in vain to fire up the heater and could not turn off the fan. They turned on the overhead heaters for awhile then they mysteriously turned off. Why?  The patio was also a little dark; several wall sconces had burned out bulbs. This immediately put us in a bad mood. Although the food was really good, we suffered through dinner with our jackets on. We could not move to the empty table next to the fireplace because it was \"reserved.\" Consequently, the fireplace table was never occupied!   White Chocolate Grill - get your act together. Check your lights, heaters, and fans BEFORE you seat people on the patio. The table next to us complained as well so it wasn't just my problem. Perhaps you had unforeseen technical problems. I at least expected an apology from the manager or some freebie for our discomfort. You delivered neither and lost a customer."}
{"text":"We had been to the White Chocolate Grill in Denver and so when my husband planned a trip to Phoenix, I told him we just had to go to this one in Phoenix. This time we also had my mother in law with us.  The food was just as outstanding as my first experience in Denver. I ordered the same thing: the spit roasted turkey dip with honey roasted carrots. There is a wonderful wild mushroom sauce that goes with the sandwich and I ate every bite. This is amazing considering I have a strong dislike for mushrooms. Yes, it is that GOOD!  We also had the white chocolate brownie which was so rich that we could not finish it. It was very very tasty. I also had the white chocolate martini made with Godiva liqueur. Yummy! I will definitely go back next time I am in town!"}
{"text":"Before I dive into the food, I got to say the atmosphere seemed mystical.  With the dim lights setting into the area, it almost seemed like a little smoky and magical within the restaurant.  That might also have to do a lot with the kitchen closer to the dining area.  It was neat to actually see the chefs in action, as though I was watching an episode of Hell's Kitchen.  The food was absolutely stunning.  We got a light caprese appetizer.  The flavors of the balsamic, oregano, and olive oil was amazing.  As my main entree,  I got the Famous Chicken Salad.  The chicken was kind of braised and it tasted tender with the balsamic vinagrette dressing.  The light appetizer and salad was a good segway to a white chocolate brownie.  I got a white chocolate martini to pair my dessert.  The brownie came with tasty vanilla bean ice cream and shaved white chocolate pieces.  I am not a big martini person, but this had a flavor of liqueur to go along with the white chocolate taste.  I came here with a Groupon, and I am definitely coming back for more!"}
{"text":"Decided to try this place the day before Valentines Day, which meant a little longer wait than usual since all the lovebirds were out and about.  Well, we finally got seated after about an hour wait and decided to try a four course selection that was about $30 bucks per person.  One of the courses was a salad, which neither of us are very big fans of at all.  We asked our waiter if we could substitute chips and salsa ($5 bucks value) for a salad that we wouldn't even eat ($10 buck value).  The waiter just shook his head and gave some lame excuse about the computer not being able to do a switch and that we would have to get a salad, even if we weren't going to eat it.  We were disappointed that they could not even compromise at all and told the waiter to not even bring out our salads since we weren't going to eat them.    Well, besides that small let down, the rest of the meal was very good. For our appetizer we got AZ egg rolls, which were really melt in your mouth good, served with some delicious dipping sauce.  For the main dish, we got the pork tenderloin and center cut steak with Parmesan cheese melted on top, which came with fries that were very tasty.  Our dessert was a really rich white chocolate brownie served with ice cream and chocolate sauce and real flakes of white chocolate on top.  It was so rich that between the two of us, we probably had 5 bites.    So all in all, I would definitely recommend this place to anyone looking for a nice place to go on a Saturday night, the prices are reasonable, the service is good (even if they aren't as flexible as they should be at times with the menu), and the food is very tasty. 3.75/5."}
{"text":"I love this place..ok only been here once, but the experience was fabulous and can't wait to go again!  It was girls dinner out - five of us gals on a Saturday night - we had reservations and were seated close to our time.  It was a stormy night and they had to close the outside patio, so they were really slammed with diners.  One gal ordered the grilled artichoke appetizer and it was so delish!  I will definetly order this next time.   For my main dish I had the Dancing Crab Cakes and Holy Crab!  There was no filler - all yummy crab - served with a plain tarter sauce which they didn't need, so wasn't too sad it didn't have a creative dipping sauce.     I was so into my dish - I don't even remember what everyone else had.     The best part was the dessert - only two of us were having dessert and on the top of the dessert menu - it says \"desserts for two\" - well....we still ordered two of them to share!     White chocolate banana cream pie was my choice and it really had an amazing flavor, but the dessert you must have is the French white chocolate bread pudding - wow - wow - wow!   I am not a big fan of bread puddings, but this is made with croissants and is not your typical bread pudding.  it melts in your mouth with white chocolate godiva liquer, caramel sauce, and golden raisens.   You must save room for dessert!  My only complaint is that the restaurant is so loud - it was really hard to carry a conversation with your table - it also is a bit dark which is great for a romantic couple dinner, but not the best for a gals night out.  oh, just remembered - get the side dish of the honey roasted carrots - that is like a dessert in itself!"}
{"text":"very houstons-esque. i hear that an old houston's employee started this place. the decor, menu & feel is very similar. the chicken was great.  they serve cous cous as one of their side options (crazy! very tasty as well). their wine selection was varied & good as well. service was good & attentive. a big plus- for a party of 8 people there was no added gratuity."}
{"text":"5 stars! This place is a sure thing. Every time I go the food is flavorful, consistent, and delivered fairly quickly. The menu has variety and includes two of my favorite meals- the southern chicken salad and the spit roasted turkey dip.  They do offer lighter options like salmon or the ahi tuna salad, both of which I have tried and enjoyed, but I keep going back to my favs. Desserts are to die for, but the entrees are a decent size so dessert rarely happens. So much to say about the food...that I almost forgot the ambiance. It is a nice retreat from the Arizona heat. It has darker tones and allows for dining privacy.  This one is a favorite."}
{"text":"I find WCG to noisy for my taste and we tend to avoid it because the wait can be prohibitive -- when we try to make reservations (for six), it is a chore. We went tonight because it was my daughter's birthday choice but she was disappointed that they don't do anything to acknowledge birthdays.. even if you're a kid."}
{"text":"Weekend plans prevented me from kicking off AZ Restaurant Week on Saturday. So on Monday, Venyse and I headed to White Chocolate Grill where we both had our cherries popped.  We started out with the spinach artichoke dip. The blends of cheeses made this perhaps the single most spectacular dip I've ever had the honor of putting in my mouth. O.M.G. Venyse and I were practically clawing at the bowl to get the last of its creamy loveliness. But when you hit a home run so soon in the game, the rest of a meal can seem at odds.  However, I was not daunted. She ordered the New York Strip with a side of mashed potatoes (with good gravy...what exactly is that?) and roasted carrots; I the blackened Mahi [*back story to follow] topped with crab and a side of Israeli couscous. We didn't share our protein, but we sampled each others sides. All were very good, but the carrots really stood out. The gravy and the potatoes were good and I loved my couscous. But halfway through here steak and by the last few bites of my fish, we both hit the wall. A food coma was certain. I persevered but Venyse relented and boxed the rest of her meat and carrots.  Then came the white chocolate brownie. So sweet, so rich, so topped with vanilla ice cream. It was all we could to to make a dent in it. We both felt bad, because isn't white chocolate supposed to be their signature ingredient?   Regardless, this was a terrific first restaurant to go with which to begin. And we both agreed it would be a place in our future dinner splurges. I also must admit I love LOVE the belt buckles. Having about 42 myself, I was intrigued when I first noticed what I thought read \"SWAG\" after staring for perhaps too long in that general region of one of the staff. (Really super sorry if that creeped you out.) It's actually WCG.  [* When a group of us went to Key West one December to escape of the harsh winter of NWOhio and Detroit, we went to a restaurant the listed \"Dolphin\" as one of its menu items. I asked in a slightly shocked voice if it was really dolphin, to which the server responded it was actually Mahi. 'Oh,' I responded. 'Then I'll have the veggie burger.' Because even in 1998 I was a food bitch.]"}
{"text":"Very consistant!  Love the WCG Chicken salad & the Tomato Gin soup is AMAZING!  But I can honestly say that everything I have had on the menu has been delish!  Can be a bit of a wait tho, most good things are.  Stand by the bar while waiting as it is first come first served :)"}
{"text":"Sunday late afternoon, not much of a crowd. Thought we would try something different for a change. Scanned the menu, ordered the stacked chicken enchiladas in red sauce, and side of honey glazed cooked carrots. The enchiladas would have been much better if they were served hot instead of  warm. It was like it was microwaved and one half was hot and other side was cold. I enjoyed the carrots they were tasty. The service was more on the slow side."}
{"text":"Very nice ambiance..Food is excellent.  I would highly recommend the filet mignon salad..."}
{"text":"This is my fave restaurant in the entire world, have been to Chicago location and the Phoenix location. I always get the flirtini drink and I love the multicolored bar. The desserts are always so damn good, especially the white chocolate banana thing."}
{"text":"I'll be visiting this place again soon so there will be room for an upgrade.  So far the food has been good, but not memorable, and the atmosphere fine, but nothing special.  There was an issue once getting a big group together so I may not go back here if we have 5 or more.  The wait staff was nice but once again, nothing of note.  I hope my next visit will bump it up to 4 stars."}
{"text":"If you are losing for a place that feels and tastes upscale but is affordable and comfortable, this is the place to go.   The service is always amazing, the staff of knowledgeable and very friendly.   The food is great and fair priced. I ordered the chicken which was undercooked but the staff and management was very quick to fix it and make it right. When they brought the properly cooked chicken to me it was delicious. My wife has some type of seafood dish (maybe the scallops), I don't eat seafood so I didn't taste it, but she raves about it as well.   I definitely would recommend this place for a nice date night or even a good meal that's a little different from the ordinary."}
{"text":"Big Juicy Gourmet Burger melted cheese with bacon  crumbles underneath. salted golden shoestring fries that compliment the juicy thick patty of beef well. The beef is ground on site so i enjoyed a medium rare burger. Very delicious.   On the bar is a \"Whisky Book\", filled with about 20 diffferent whisky's.  If you like Bourbon's or Whisky's this is enough reason to go. Wish they had a few more beers, but i have a feeling i've only scratched the surface here.  burger was $9, beer was $4 on hh."}
