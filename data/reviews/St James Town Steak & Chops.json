{"text":"Thoughtful service and excellent food.  My turkey sandwich was HUGE, and only cost 4.99. Nice ambiance too - I took my sandwich to go but wouldn't mind staying next time. If you find yourself hungry in Cabbagetown I would definitely recommend checking this place out."}
{"text":"Being a Cabbage Town resident, I try to support local businesses.  The previous time I came here, the employee was acting as a cashier, handling money with his bare hands, and then went and picked my steaks with his bare hands, without washing them, without putting paper between, without putting gloves on, etc. Giving this place the benefit of the doubt, I went back. Again, the same employee was handling change and touching unclean things, and then grabbed my steaks with his bare hands. This is disgusting and unhygienic. I will never go back, and will drive across the city to Sanagan's Meat Locker, where they have great meat and also know how to handle it properly."}
{"text":"What has changed here? Have gone here for great steaks etc and been very pleased. Today I picked up a couple steaks...$27...not so great. Actually the past few purchases have been less than satisfactory.  Back to Cumbraes."}
{"text":"I'm giving this place zero stars as I can't even begin to tell you how many times I've gone here and have been given rancid meat.. It's a matter of time until someone gets really sick (or dies) from the rotten meat here."}
{"text":"I've done take-away sandwiches here on a number of occasions. Delicious every time and the bread is so fresh. There's a young man who works behind the counter who has the sweetest smile and always takes great care of everyone. Will return!"}
{"text":"I had the pleasure of taking part in a steak tasting at St. Jamestown Steak and Chops hosted by owner Mark Michelin by invitation of esteem foodie Joel Solish(@foodie411) from Community Foodis. Not only was it a gorgeous night to hang out on the patio of this local , cabbagetown gem while experiencing some decadent food with good company of fellow foodies. The challenge as I understand it started with a bet between Mark and Joel about if anybody can tell the different between wet age and dry aged steak. I understand the difference is very subtle and almost undetectable.  Both the roasts were served to us - and were both flavoured equally - simply coated in butter, salt,  and pepper before going into the oven.   They were both rare and flavourful.  I was trying to eat a mouthful, cleanse my pallet with a cab franc and then have the next mouthful.  They were so tender and juicy.  It was hard to figure out but I chose 'A' which the majority seemed to pick.  Mark Michelin later revealed afterwards that A = wet-aged and B = dry-aged which proves that really these subtle differences between the meat can't be detected too well!! Seriously one of the best tastings in my limited culninary career and a huge thanks to Mark Michelin and Joel for a wonderful night!!"}
{"text":"I tried the Montreal Smoked Meat Sandwich and was not disappointed. The sandwich tasted fresh and was so thick with meat I had to nibble at the edges. The pickles they garnished the plate with were also delicious.   Although a sandwich and a can of coke came out costing me $9+, I would definitely come back. It's hard to find a great sandwich in this city and this place can definitely provide you with that.   St. Jamestown Delicatessen was full of faces that felt familiar and were very friendly. It has big windows so you can look out into Cabbagetown while you eat. The atmosphere was pleasant.   I can imagine this place being very busy at lunch time. I went around 3:30pm on a Sunday and it still had a steady stream of customers."}
{"text":"Nice place, great sandwiches and a nice selection of prepared food. Some items are on the pricey side but portions are generous and everything is quality."}
{"text":"Love the pulled pork sandwich + comes with a nice lightly dressed mixed greens salads. Good value, relaxed atmosphere."}
{"text":"I kept passing this by, because there never seemed to be anyone in there....and frankly, I wasn't sure if it was a restaurant or a deli or what.  But I'm so glad I finally made it in!  On first glance, the sandwiches seem to be on the pricier end of sandwich shops.   Though some run below $5, my turkey sandwich was closer to 8, with no sides.  HOWEVER, this sandwich was huge, packed full of meat and veggies.  I would have payed more for this delicious sandwich.  The bread was also soft and fresh and amazing.  They have a wide variety of sandwich options, plus potpies, mac and cheese, quiches ( i think) and a variety of other options that I can't wait to try.  This has definitely been added to my list of favorites in the neighbourhood."}
{"text":"I pop into this deli at least weekly for lunch. I'm happy to say there are vegetarian options that are affordable and satisfying. I switch between wraps and sandwiches, but I love that they take care to add in \"extras\" like fresh veggies (and they don't skimp!). It is so convenient to be able to pick up fresh produce from the attached grocery and a made-to-order lunch at the same time! They also have a fridge section with take-away salads and hot meals. Overall, a great community fixture with friendly service."}
{"text":"THE best hot sausages.  I'm talking about the ones that are ready to eat with a fresh baguette, no cooking required.  They're on a little wooden rack sitting on top of the counter near the back of the shop.  The lower rack has the non-hot sausages, and the hot ones are on top."}
{"text":"I like deli's. My parents owned one growing up, and I have fond memories of fresh sandwiches and goulash soup :). My idea of a good deli, is somewhere with affordable prices, low-key atmosphere, and yummy sandwiches.  St. Jamestown fit this criteria...except it was a little on the high priced side. I got a ham and swiss sandwich on a toasted kaiser for $8. The taste was exceptional and they piled the ham high. I was there just before noon, it wasn't too busy, easy to find a table to sit at. It was very relaxed and I took my time hanging out, certainly could of bought a coffee and felt comfortable lounging around further (alas had to get back to work).   The deli server was really nice, and took his time making my sandwich.  I noticed they have a great selection of cookies, muffins and other cakes. I will be returning to try these items. They also happen to be more affordably priced compared to my sandwich...ie. $1.49 for a giant sized cookie!  There were alot of options on the menu for sandwiches wraps, hot items and salads at varying prices. And there are descent vegetarian options."}
{"text":"great value here.  i ordered the cheese and veggie sandwich which was only 4.99.  you get a piece of paper, you tick off what you want on the sandwich and voila!  you get three slices of cheese and generous amounts of veggies!!!!  it was perfect.  service can be a bit slow but just be patient.  it's not a race, ok? slow down people.  i will from now on go to this place whenever i am downtown in the east end of things."}
{"text":"Total disappointment. I ordered the corn beef based on the description heated.  When the sandwich arrived it was cold. I told the cashier that it was supposed to be heated but she said it wasn't circled so...  Essentially too bad, it was my fault. I mentioned that there is no way I could have known that I would have to circle heated to have it heated and I had ordered the sandwich because it said it was heated.  She was clearly impatient and done with me as I had already paid. I suggested that she at least have the form changed because frankly, a person would have to have psychic moment to get what they wanted.  She said the form isn't her job and was then done with me. I really don't like corned beef cold, it's just so much better heated. I really think they owe me a do over. Everyone else I went with had a lovely meal."}
{"text":"I have only gotten food to take away, but all of it has been delicious. They had such awesome sausage flavours as pear/blue cheese, chorizo, and the flattened chickens are really delicious.  They even have a few veggies on hand in case you need them but, being a delicatessen, their primary focus is meat!"}
{"text":"When I first moved into the area one of the first things I looked for was a butcher. Grocery store meat is okay, but still pales in comparison to a good butcher.   I am a carnivore and very far from being a tree hugger, but I do generally prefer my meat to be organic as there tends to be a lot more flavour. Unfortunately that is not on the menu at St Jamestown Steak & Chops. In fact, there is not much selection of meats at all. It is very possible that I have been spoiled by larger shops with anything you can imagine at the tip of the butcher's blade, but I was not impressed at all. In total there is not more than 25 different cuts of meat with only 6 types of sausage. Want a good piece of lamb? You have two options. Ribs? Back, side, short, that's it. Steak? Maybe 3-4 different cuts. Anything a little more exotic like rabbit or venison and you are just completely out of luck.  That all being said, the selections that they do have is of great quality. I suppose it is better to sacrifice having a quantity of different cuts to have only fresh quality cuts on hand. Other than the severe lack of consistency in the cut thickness of the short ribs, everything I have purchased has been of exceptional quality.  The staff are all friendly and know their meats well. I don't think I have ever been served by the same face more than once, but it is always service with a smile no matter who is behind the counter. I would recommend them because they are the only place in the area to get a good piece of meat, but if you want something different you will have to venture out of the area a little."}
{"text":"I love these butchers. They're some of the best in the city. Whenever I need a hard to find meat or a particular quality, I can expect them to deliver. I needed oxtail, they had it. I wanted to smoke some ribs but hard a had time finding logs of smoking wood - they gave me some for free, I was brining and smoking a Turkey - gave me great brining advice and free brining spices to use etcetera Excellent customer service which is why I keep coming back"}
{"text":"Best best best. Best chorizo that I have had in the city (and I have tried). The kind that has the adobo just ooze out.   Extremely awesome burgers as well. The ones that you think you can eat so many of them but soon realize that these are different and amazingly filling.   Now a fan!"}
{"text":"Cabbagetown gem!  An awesome place for a quick lunch bite or take out.  The sandwiches are good and prices are decent.  I've heard a lot of good things about their chili and keep missing it as its a hot item.  Will post a review after having it too..."}
{"text":"I'm writing this review after my second visit.  I don't know what you look for in a butcher but what I look for are two things 1) Knowledge: I want my butcher to be able to answer simple \"meat\" questions like what sausage is hotter the hot Italian or the Macedonian ? I don't want an answer that says buy the two and you tell me! Then when agree he asks \" can I wrap them all together?\" My response - then how will I know them apart? Oh and the sausages not good.They had no heat to them and lacked flavor. 2) Customize: I want my butcher to assist and customize ( cuts, seasoning)  that  other places don't have, I want them to be able to do the little things that the big box stores will not do for me.  I will say the pulled pork was very delicious. It was smoked to perfection, moist and the bbq sauce was tangy with a hint of heat."}
{"text":"Delicious food, fresh meat. Had the Montreal smoked meat sandwich on light rye. Very generous cuts of meat they give you. You can't taste the freshness of this meat. Dark roast coffee is good too! I would definitely come back here to eat."}
{"text":"Decent food - love the grilled cheese and the tuna sandwiches - but service is extremely hit or miss. Sometimes you wait 5 minutes for your grilled cheese and your soup and sometimes you wait 20. Some of the staff are delightful and some are filled with palpable disdain for the customers. Bit of a crapshoot, which is not what you want from your neighbourhood staple."}
{"text":"Whereas this place should have been a neighborhood's favorite, it is definitely not... sausages, burger patties are just par and not worth the price... and service is regularly rude, except maybe for those rare, noisy customers who seem to be super regular (and should try other meat shops and see how better things can be elsewhere!) or fake (??) customers. The employee was only interested in loudly chatting with another customer while serving me, without any interest in what he was really selling to me... (I went twice and twice the exact, same experience!)  I'll walk 5 minutes more to go to another, more courteous and better meat shop. Based on most recent reviews, I seem to think alike others.... good reviews were before 2012... time for some managerial self-questioning and up-scaling adjustments?"}
{"text":"This awesome sandwich shop is attached to St. Jamestown Steak & Chops, so already you know the meat they put on their sandwiches is going to be good.  For $4-7.50 you can get a wide variety of sandwiches and wraps from Egg or Tuna Salad, Ham, Salami, Pastrami, to vegetarian options like veggies and cheese, grilled cheese, or P.B. & J with Banana.    They have a great selection of salads and hot dishes too.  You can get cabbage rolls, meatloaf, or mac & cheese.  They offer freshly squeezed lemon and lime aids, and don't forget the gelato for dessert.  If you're looking to relax and enjoy a hot beverage they brew fair trade coffee, big leaf tea, and hot chocolate.  For a cooler treat enjoy a fresh fruit smoothie.  On my visit I opted for the BLT with cucumber.  After a few short minutes the lady behind the counter presents me with a behemoth of a sandwich that I could barely get my mouth around.  I estimated that there was 8 pieces of bacon on this thing, and not just any bacon, thick sliced bacon.  For $7.41, which included a large chocolate milk, it was a great lunch.  The deli atmosphere is great with huge windows and high ceilings that look out onto Parliament street and the side patio.  They have 4 tables and a bar to eat at, or you can lounge on the patio in the shade of a giant tree."}
{"text":"I've been eating here for a number of years.  Their sandwiches are totally awesome, from the Chicken and Fish Sandwiches, i always come back here at least 3 times a year (i'm always busy, but whenever i feel like a sandwich, this place comes top in mind.  I highly recommend ordering the Montreal Smoked Meat Sandwich with melted Swiss cheese, light rye bread and the works (i usually omit hot peppers but you add it if you want).  Oh man It is mighty delicious!  Juicy, plump and full or flavour.  That and a San Pelligrino soda, it makes for a great meal!"}
{"text":"This really is the creme de la creme of meat shops. Le filet mignon de le filet mignon? I don't know. I'll work on funny meat sayings...  I've had steak, ribs and breakfast sausages from this place, and they were all among the best cuts of meat I've ever purchased. Truly outstanding place to buy your BBQ fare this summer. If this isn't your hood, believe me, it's worth the trip. I'll bet you a steak.  They also have lots of great meat rubs (sounds dirty) and sides, as well as just other great organic groceries and specialty sauces for purchase.   These cats know what they're doing. They are true butchers, not some kids with summer jobs at the grocery store. They really are a cut above the rest.  Heaven help me this review has me thinking in meat puns."}
