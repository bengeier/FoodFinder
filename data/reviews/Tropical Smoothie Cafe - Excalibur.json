{"text":"Great smoothie but super slow service. Seems they don't have good organization of who doing what? The cashier went back to the counter to make smoothie but no one attends the new customers, who ended up leaving. I wait probably 10 mins for a smoothie."}
{"text":"I'm a berry person so I tried the acai berry boost. It was just ok but it lacked a little sweetness to it."}
{"text":"Both of our smoothies had little flavor, mostly tasted like ice. We had the island green and the acai, both were terrible. They cost about $6.50-7. Too expensive & bad flavor."}
{"text":"Never come here. Ordered a hummus vege bowl that includes kale, beans, spinach, etc. i had to remind them to start making it after waiting 10 minutes. It took another 30 minutes to make. It was missing kale, beans, spinach, and other ingredients. Had to return the salad and explain that the hummus vege bowl contains spinach, beans, etc. The manager and staff somehow didnt know that those were the main ingredients, and had to find the menu. 

They then brought the salad back (BUT IT WAS STILL MISSING INGREDIENTS?? Including the main base kale???)

Again they had to take it back. I dont understand how you can get ingredients wrong when youre staring at the menu trying to make the dish?

They then present the salad again with no kale.

They finally blamed the whole situation on the fact that they no longer do that dish and therefore dont stock kale, asparagus, etc. THEN WHY DOES IT SAY \" NEW RECIPE\" ON YOUR MENU. WHY DIDNT ANYONE TELL ME YOU DONT HAVE THE INGREDIENTS??

Finally they offered a weak gesture of good will \"if you come back tomorrow you can get a free smoothie\". Why cant i have a free smoothie right now??"}
{"text":"YUUUUUMMMM

A healthy fast food joint where smoothies replace sodas what a brilliant idea. We NEED this in Sydney!!

We ordered:
x BAJA CHICKEN the flatbread was so soft and doughy. Filling was so tasty.
x STEAK TZATZIKI same for this one but not a favourite.
x AVOCOLADA - so fresh so smooth so perfect"}
{"text":"Based on the other reviews I gave it a try, and they were right! I ordered the club sandwich and the wonderful green smoothie and it was all good. While the sandwich is not huge, it's very tasty, well assembled, and your meal includes an apple or orange as a side.  When traveling it's hard to eat healthy, but this place helps a lot.  The smoothie is really good and it's a great big cup. The staff there are friendly and seemed to really enjoy working there.  Yes, while I am in Vegas, I am going back there.  Oh, and the sandwich with the huge smoothie and the orange was $12.95, which for Vegas is very reasonable."}
{"text":"The peanut paradise is, delicious. You can taste the banana in it. The whey protein is light and doesn't affect the taste at all. The floors and counter are very clean and the employee have great customer service"}
{"text":"A healthier opt in at the food court if you're not looking to gauge in fast food! 

Both the baja chicken and steak tzatziki flatbread were so GOOD!! Definitely a cheap option. Only $6 for the sandwich. You can add $4 to get a smoothie."}
{"text":"Service was great food was horrible!  Ordered a flatbread it was soggy and all the veggies were nasty maybe the wraps and smoothies are better"}
{"text":"I am from the East Coast so I shrieked with delight when I saw a location here. However, while the food is still amazing and the smoothies are still huge, the service here is terrible. Just to take my order was 10 minutes and there was no one in front of me. The workers were all in the back doing who knows what. Then for my food to come out was an additional 15 minutes. It took such a long time that I would have rather gone to the back and made my own food. To make matters worse they didn't take any additional orders for 10 minutes after my food was ordered. Such terribly slow service which really is unacceptable in Vegas. And why does everybody have such an attitude problem? It's Vegas, be happy.

I did notice another woman complain after my food came out and they looked at her with daggers in their eyes. How dare she complain after waiting 20 minutes? Come on now...I think she had every right to complain at that point. If you don't like your job work somewhere else."}
{"text":"Food was good. Smoothie was great.  Service not good. They lost the order for girl ahead of me. I had to ask for chips that were supposed to be included with sandwich and the staff seemed confused."}
{"text":"I work at the Excalibur, they didn't give me the employee discount we are supposed to get, and when I asked one of the other employees, they said \"next time\" and walked away.. Smoothies also took forever for me being the only one there and were kinda chunky. A word wasn't said to me by any other employee, \"What would you like today?\", \"Have a nice day!\" Etc.., they just seemed not to care. Most tropical smoothies are like that for some reason, except the one on Las Vegas Blvd by the South Premium Outlets. Service at this one has been great before, but this time it sucked!"}
{"text":"A bit pricey for food court fast food however it's a healthier option to what's around and they've got great smoothies! Plus they're open late so that's always a plus. Takes a little long to get your food but it's all fresh so all in all worth the wait. If it was a bit cheap and faster I would say 5 stars :)"}
{"text":"Had the smoothie + half a sandwich for $8.99.  Great deal!  Island Green smoothie was excellent!   Trust me,  it really is good. 

Sandwich was the turkey bacon ranch.   The roll/Bread was very soft and good.   I am full."}
{"text":"Try the green island!!!  I wanted something healthy and was brave that day to try something new.  The green island was oh so very yummy and I'll drink it everyday if I could.  It's got spinach, kale, mango, pineapple, and bananas.  I was afraid of the veggies but I couldn't taste them at all!  The staff was also very friendly and gave me good advice about the drinks."}
{"text":"Ordered my typical Kiwi Quencher, tasted perfect today! Perfect amount of sweetness, recommend everyone to come and get one too. My sis got an island green and loved it."}
{"text":"Best Ever! I was sad to discover this gem on the last of my 6 days there. The peanut butter one was breath taking."}
{"text":"I went here my first time last week, the service was slow but they knew what they were doing. I actually didn't wait that long, I had the mocha coffee smoothie and half sandwich. Was so good, defiantly going back when I visit."}
{"text":"The smoothies here are amazing. Its my friends favorite smoothie place and it did not disappoint. The smoothies are fresh and the serving size is big so you really get your money's worth. My friend got a sandwich too and it was yummy as well."}
{"text":"SLOW as molasses, tasty food and smoothies. Definitely the healthiest option in that food court, if not all of Excalibur and Luxor. It's worth the wait."}
{"text":"We were surprised to find this place has good veg options.  Healthy, cheap, quick, easy food. For where it is and what it is, this is as good as it gets. We ordered the hummus veggie wrap and the Thai chicken wrap with Beyond Meat non-chicken and both were delicious. The tortilla is perfectly grilled. Plus you can get a piece of fruit as a side (an apple or orange make a great snack later). The green smoothie was also good, sans the Splenda."}
{"text":"I really loved the green smoothie. It was so nice to get some vegetables in Vegas! They also didn't add any extra sugar upon request."}
{"text":"Probably the healthiest option out of the restaurants at Excalibur. Highly recommend. Not too expensive and enough food for the price."}
{"text":"Smoothies are great, but this is THE slowest place ever. Not a single person in line ahead of me, but it took them five minutes to take my order and nearly ten minutes more to make two smoothies."}
{"text":"Had the turkey wrap and muscle smoothie. Was the best option in the food court and tasted delicious. Final stop before airport, definitely don't regret it!"}
{"text":"Got a wrap and it was pretty gross. Undercooked chicken, too much sauce for my taste just bad overall."}
{"text":"Came here to get my smoothie fix satisfied in Vegas. For a small store in a food court, they make an awesome smoothie. I ordered the smoothie and panini combo( avocado green smoothie with barbecue chicken panini). The smoothie is very refreshing and tastes delicious. It has a great consistency that is easy to drink, not too thick. It is also naturally sweet and isn't overpowering. The panini was standard and tasted good, but was nothing special.  I recommend coming here if you are in the Excalibur."}
