{"text":"I hate to say it because we've been getting our Chinese food from here for years, but this will be my last time.  A year ago we ordered from here and everything was bland and tasteless.  The next time, everything was burnt and inedible.  So we took a break and tried Kingston Rd. Chinese up the street.  It is fantastic!  Tonight, in a rush, I grabbed a combo from Seaspray.  It was bland and tasteless.  AND it did't come with a springroll or an eggroll.  What?!?!  No more.  I'm so sorry, but I think we'll stick to Kingston Rd. Chinese from now on."}
{"text":"Stay Away!!!!
           I have just eaten at this place for the second time this Month and for the second time I was violently sick to my stomach the next day BOTH times.  The first time I thought maybe stomach flu or something but the second time no way it's the restaurant food.
         I've been eating here for at least five years without a problem.  That's when the older fellow owned it.  But these new people seem to be letting the place go.  The food has little flavor going down, coming up not so much

         I will not ever eat here again."}
{"text":"Pretty decent food and selection but overall bland in taste. Everything kind of has a general taste to it with a splash of chili sauce, nothing outstanding. iv'e only ordered there twice and to be honest if im going to spend close to 50 bucks on an order id rather look a little harder for a gem."}
{"text":"My roommate ordered from here a couple weekends ago. She didn't really love it so she gave me the leftovers to see if I'd like it. A splash of chili sauce makes almost anything edible. It was the chop suey with chicken, and wasn't bad. 
So this past weekend when my guy and I felt like ordering chinese, we tried them again. I don't have much choice when it comes to chinese food in my neighbourhood unfortunately. I ordered cantonese beef chow mein, and he ordered dinner for one with an egg roll, sweet & sour balls, chicken chop suey and B.B.Q. pork fried rice, which he substituted for chicken fried rice. 
The food, when we finally received it, was fine. I'd give the food 3 stars. But I'm bringing their rating down to 2 stars for lack of service. I placed my order on the phone around 6:30. They took it, didn't give me the total it would come to and didn't tell me when to expect it. We were super hungry! I called back after waiting about 35-40mins with no signs of food. 
They told me \"Ya, it's here\". 
I asked \"Well, how much longer will it be for it to get here?\" 
Their response? \"30 or 40 minutes\",
Me: \"ANOTHER 30 minutes? i ordered more than 30 minutes ago.\"
Them: \"Oh, um, okay 10 minutes\" 
Click. 
Much left to be desired... 
I did get my food in about 15-20 mins. Almost an hour after i ordered it. Considering it takes very little time to cook, I don't think an hour wait is acceptable especially when the restaurant is only 1 km from my house. It would have taken me less time to walk there and back. Maybe i should have..."}
{"text":"If you're craving classic Canadian-Chinese grub, this place has you covered. Been eating here for years and I've never had a bad meal. The orange beef and Singapore noodles are definitely my go-to. Complimentary chicken wings are also a bonus."}
{"text":"I have ordered from theses folks in the past however the future is bleak. I ordered dinner for 8 of us this past Sunday and we were food poisoned! Never again. It's two days over and I'm still dealing with this sickness. In the past the food was fine? Sorry but SeaSpray, it was a brief relationship, we're done."}
{"text":"Cheap, I will give them that. Really depends what you order. A basic meat dish is ok if it's deep fried. The General Tao tasted like catsup and most of their vegetables taste like they have been sitting around for a long time. Especially the mushrooms. 

I have worked in kitchens, I know how impossible it can be to keep that all fresh, but at some point either make soup or throw it out.

But it is cheap  and the beer is 3 bucks. Of course that attracts the more colourful from the  neighborhood"}
{"text":"Aren't a ton of options in the area and this place is usually pretty good. We usually order the General Tso and something else. Food always seems fresh and delivery is pretty quick (obviously order ahead of its New Years or Christmas)"}
