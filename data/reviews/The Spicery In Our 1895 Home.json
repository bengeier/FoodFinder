{"text":"High Afternoon Tea on a Sunday in May! Lovely, quaint little tea house serving up bite-sized delicacies and delicious tea. I actually despise tea in general but this tea was special and coupled with the entire experience, I enjoyed it.   I spent a May afternoon at The Spicery with a *bunch* of girlfriends. I just loved the antique porcelain tea sets, all different in size/shape/color and the lace table linens. Reminded me of my beloved Nanna's apartment in Europe. Very special.  The ladies who ran the busy tea house didn't have much time to chat but managed to deliver fairly timely service and hot tea in various kettles, which they kept full throughout our stay. Very accommodating for our big party of women and little ones. Never felt rushed to leave which is a good thing since the high tea service takes at least +1.5 hours to enjoy.   The Spicery is an 1895 historic home-turned-restaurant in downtown Glendale. The floors still creek and the rooms are quite small. I was only able to communicate with the ladies in my room (3 other small tables) as there are many walls that separate all the little niches and coves in the home/restaurant. The bathrooms were clean which is the gold standard for eateries. Leave the kids at home as there isn't enough room for them to wander about and they were always under foot of the busy staff in such tight quarters.   The only reason I rate The Spicery FOUR STARS is due to the lack of adequate air-conditioning. Unfortunately, I stayed fairly moist in the back room and felt the area could've used more air circulation. Hoping they improved on this since our last visit as I plan to patronize them again very soon.   Don't forget to don your feather boas and long, satin gloves!"}
{"text":"We are snowbirds from Illinois and decided to see something in the Phoenix area that is historical. We loved the quaint shops and so friendly shop owners in downtown Glendale. The Spicery was recommended by a lady in one of the shops. We found our entire experience at The Spicery outstanding. The hostess and waitress were extremely accommodating and helpful. The two of us split a salad and sandwich. The waitress did a great job in getting the orders split. The soup, rolls, salad, sandwich, tea were marvelous! We will be back!"}
{"text":"Beautiful historic house and delicious food. I took my mom here for lunch on a Saturday for noon reservations. We found street parking about 1 block away. The decor is lovely and old-fashioned; lace tablecloths and nice dinnerware. We got the turkey sandwich and seafood pot pie. The roll that the turkey sandwich was made with was absolutely delicious. We also shared the bread pudding, and we agree that it was the best bread pudding we've ever had. The area is great for a walk around the old homes and antique stores."}
{"text":"Just took my mom and her friend for afternoon tea, it was delightful! Food and service were excellent, I will definitely go back!"}
{"text":"Went to The Spicery for tea and the food was amazing. Everything was freshly made  and they have a great tea selection. The ambiance was very laid back and relaxing. The servers were very efficient and friendly. Can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"I was here with a friend today. The food was excellent and the service was outstanding. I highly recommend this place!!!!!!  The only negative is that they don't seem to offer finger sandwiches."}
{"text":"The food and service at the Spicery 1895 House must be in a competition to determine which is the best. What a fabulous Mother's Day treat!"}
{"text":"Quaint and cute. But the service and attitude of the owner is far from that.  Its clear that the owner of this restaurant has never worked for any hospitality based business that has the customer in mind. If you've been to The Ritz Carlton...this is the opposite.  If you can slide in without much interaction with the hostess and have all the time in the world for an afternoon with your lady friends...then I'm sure you'll enjoy it."}
{"text":"Went here for lunch today with a colleague, and I have to say this was the sweetest lunch break! This old house is charming!    If you love sandwiches made from the most amazing biscuits-made on the property by the owner, desserts that are decadent, tea that soothes the soul, this place is for you! Their 'high tea' is worth looking into, which I do plan to experience when the weather cools.  Every bite was delicious, and I felt so relaxed and refreshed, and a little sad to leave this treasure today, but look forward to the return!"}
{"text":"Love this place! Service is always great and the chicken salad sandwich is amazing!   The ambiance is great for a ladies lunch!"}
{"text":"Cute place over here. Came in with my future in-laws, and we each got a pot of tea of our choice to try. The Jasmine Pearl was the best in my opinion, followed by Raspberry Hibiscus and Queen Victoria. We also tried the Apple Cinnamon and Peppermint tea along with the Orange Blossom.  The scones were freshly made and tasted amazing! Followed by some small sandwiches as a second course, and then we had a vanilla custard with strawberries and whipped cream with some small brownie bites and others goodies. Service was great and people were extremely friendly. Highly recommended, but make a reservation in advance...and check out the blue and library room!"}
{"text":"Many, many years ago we had my daughter's 8th birthday party at \"The Spicery\".  The little girls dressed up like big girls and ate little sandwiches while sipping on play tea!  A fun time was had by all!  Now 24 years later my Mom and I are planning her first baby shower at the same quaint little restaurant!  What a wonderful way to welcome a new life!  Everyone at the Spicery make you feel right at home!  Service is great and the food is just excellent!  I can't wait until February to share this wonderful place with all our guests!"}
{"text":"The Spicery is my favorite place in Glendale! Whenever friends or family visit The Spicery is one of the spots I can't wait to take them to. The salads are amazing & I love the croissant sandwiches too. The walnut pineapple cake is a must get. You won't be sorry! Give The Spicery a try. It'll be a place you will add to your favorites list!"}
{"text":"As a true lover of all things tea, I have a strong desire to try any tea place in town.  I frequent English Rose Tearoom quite often and feel it is the best around, but I am always willing to try something new and have been wanted to go to The Spicery for awhile.  So, the Hubs and I ventured all the way to Downtown Glendale for a new tea experience.  We called ahead for reservations and my Husband even requested scones, since they aren't on their menu everyday.  Upon our arrival, we were greeted warmly and seated promptly by the window (a nice spot).  The place was packed, which I was pleasantly surprised about.  The scones/shortbread we were presented with were warm and served with cream and lemon curd.  All of it was very tasty and clearly homemade and fresh.  We ordered a pot of tea and I had the chicken salad sandwich and the Hubs had quiche.  I felt the chicken salad was just ok, as was the tea.  We had the Queen Victoria and after awhile I felt it became really bitter.  Also, they didn't have sugar cubes, only the packets, which was a bit odd to me.  The Hubs enjoyed his quiche.  All in all, this was a nice experience.  I loved the old house and the fact that everything was homemade.  This restaurant is a bit far for us, and there wasn't a huge tea selection, which is my favorite part of the experience typically.  If I am in the area, I would definitely consider popping for in for a nice homemade lunch in the future."}
{"text":"LOVE The Spicery. The restaurant has the charm of grandma's house while the food reminds me of Mom's cooking. My favorite is their quiche followed by the delicious chicken salad on their homemade bread roll. Yum!  The staff is always so pleasant and thoughtful. It's always a treat to spend time at The Spicery with family and friends. If you're in the neighborhood be sure not to miss this little treasure. You won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Amazing experience.  The food was delicious.  The atmosphere was adorable.  It is so quaint and pretty.  We were lucky that we came when we did because if you don't have a reservation they will turn you away.  You must make a reservation if you want to eat here!!  The tea selection is amazing.  I definitely recommend it for anyone!"}
{"text":"We went today and loved The Spicery! Their strawberry salad and pasta with sauce and veggies from the garden was delicious, as well as their homemade rolls, their soup, hot tea, ice tea and desserts (we had the chocolate cake and the puffed pastry with cream....both incredibly delicious!). We loved the atmosphere, the colors of the rooms and the attention to details, the cleanness of the place, and their service was great! Perfect for all occasions! 5 stars! After your lunch or teatime at The Spicery, take the time to have a walk around the beautiful neighborhood, filled with gorgeous late 1800s/early 1900s' houses, some of which host the cutest little shops with a ton of nice things. You'll feel like you're stepping back in time....absolutely fabulous!"}
{"text":"I just went there this past weekend for their Royal Tea event, (my second time there) and it was lovely and COOL inside, even though the place is fairly tiny, which can never be underestimated in this weather. You could carry on a conversation without feeling claustrophobic or as though you had to shout over everyone. Also, the decor, lawn and atmosphere were beautifully vintage and feminine. The tea was delicious, as were the finger foods, the staff was friendly and attentive. We're actually planning to make a monthly trip there from now on as a sort of treat."}
{"text":"I have to give one star otherwise I won't be able to do a review. I have to say that when I first made reservations, I spoke with a very nice man named Matt. As the days  grew closer to our afternoon tea, I was getting phone calls from a woman, my guess is the owner, to ask if I had a final count of those of us who were coming for afternoon tea. She called me a day earlier than what Matt and I had agreed on so I gave her the count as far as those who had rsvp'ed to me. Now she called me on a Tuesday and our reservations weren't for 4 days, until Saturday. Unfortunately, I received a cancelation the night before our scheduled afternoon tea, something out of my control. We then showed up for afternoon tea today, 4 of us instead of the original 5 we had made the reservations for and upon arrival, the owner/hostess was extremely rude. There were only a few people in the restaurant so they all could hear our conversation. She asked if we were expecting the 5th person and I kindly apologized and explained that the 5th person had cancelled the night before. In front of the other customers in the small restaurant, she proceeded to very rudely make a face and say to us that we were going to have to still pay for the 5th person and just take their food home with us. We simply said we were okay with that.  We proceeded to sit down and start our afternoon tea session semi embarrassed because of the way she had reacted in front of the other patrons, so needless to say it felt awkward and uncomfortable. I thought to myself, wow they must've prepared a lot of food for our afternoon tea, we must really be putting them out. As our food came out, I can actually give a quick run down of what they actually served us, to start a tiny scone and a skinny shortbread cookie. Our second course consisted of a bite sized, yes bite sized ham sandwich, a bite sized tuna sandwich, if you can even call it that, and maybe a two to three small bite sized chicken salad sandwich, all with way too much mayo! Oh yeah and a bite sized cucumber on top of a small piece of bread. They might call that a sandwich too. For dessert, yeah you guessed it, bite sized desserts. I can say that everything we ate could have fit on a small salad plate. It was really humorous when our server came around and told us to eat our tiny parfait before the other bite sized desserts because if we were too full, our parfait  wouldn't hold up well if we had to take it home. Seriously?! We weren't the least bit full! We paid the bill and split it between 3 of us, since we were treating the guest of honor, and we each paid $50! My husband and I had to go out to eat about an hour after we finished with tea because at that point I was getting hangry! I received text messages from my friends saying they were doing the same!  Oh and the tea wasn't very good, I ordered the Queen Victoria tea, I had to peek inside my teapot because I thought they had forgotten the actual tea but nope, the one measly tea bag was floating in there, and let me just say for such a stuffy atmosphere, they had NO sugar cubes! How uncivilized is that for an afternoon tea, no sugar cubes?! I'll stick with driving all the way to Carefree to go to the English Rose Tea Room, always great service there, delicious tea and food, and sugar cubes!"}
{"text":"Not only was today my first visit to The Spicery, it was also the first time I've ever been to tea.  The tea service is a pure joy!  Three courses, including an assortment of finger sandwiches (2nd course) and a well chosen tea list.  Our wonderful server Lisa made our visit all the more enjoyable, sharing her knowledge of the delightful food.  And the restaurant itself is located in a historic home, each room with its own personality.  The decor is inviting, cosy and relaxing.  This would be a great Mother's Day treat!"}
{"text":"We have been back multiple times since this first visit. Always good service and the food and tea is wonderful!"}
{"text":"The food and tea on the Afternoon Tea menu is very delicious however it is way overpriced!   $23. for a small scone with clotted cream and lemon curd; a small piece of shortbread, 4 tiny single bite open faced sandwiches, and a variety of tiny desserts. Oh, and a pot of tea.   When I say small I mean tiny!   I would gladly pay $15. for that not $23 plus tax and tip.   We spent $60. with tip for Afternoon Tea."}
{"text":"LOVED LOVED LOVED this place!!!!!  The people are extremely friendly, the decor is beautiful in each tearoom and the tea, food and desserts are delicious!!! I don't have anything bad to say about this place except you have to go and try it!!!!"}
{"text":"We were looking forward to a special Valentine dinner with dear friends that we hadn't seen in awhile.  When we arrived we asked the owner if he had medium rare prime rib.  He said yes.  It came out well done and was sent back.   The next one came back medium.  All four of our dinner were cold.  Not once were we asked how our dinner was by our server or the owner.  The owner talked to us about raising his prices.  How would he like to spend $30 for a cold meal???  A special meal at that. UNACCEPTABLE!!!  Wait it gets better....  we had just finished our desserts and the owner abruptly came up to our table and told us we HAD to leave.  He had 2 minutes to clear and reset the  table.    REALLY, COLD FOOD and THEN BEING KICKED OUT???   NEVER AGAIN!!  You should be ashamed of yourself!!!"}
{"text":"I came here for Mother's Day after trying another tea room on Easter that I like but my daughter wanted to try this place because the house was bigger so we made reservations. We were all dolled up and there was a Mother's Day menu. I ordered the eggs Benedict and I am somewhat of a connoisseur of hollandaise sauce but was was disgusted with theirs but I tried to eat it because I didn't want to ruin this special day. After I tried to get through one of the eggs, I decided I should tell the lady so that other people were disappointed too.  When I told the waitress she snapped back at me that it was all premade and there was nothing they could do and I was like well I just thought you might want to know the sauce isn't good because your other customers? She asked if I wanted a new dish and I just asked for a cup of cream of broccoli soup. Sadly, the soup was just as gross as it tasted like just milk with chopped broccoli.  My daughter had bacon quiche and it was also not very good. The only thing that was good was the rolls. We will not be going back here again because the food was not good but the environment was very nice. I also didn't think the service was as good as it could've been for such a nice quaint place"}
{"text":"After talking about 'going for tea', we finally did it! This place was a gem. Located in a quant home in downtown Glendale, the home boasts several themed rooms. The service, food, and ambience was perfect. My friend's preteen daughter felt special with her own assortment of fruits and pastries. We will be back!"}
{"text":"Excellent food in a pleasant environment. While we couldn't finish the dessert it wasn't for lack of desire. The first bite of the warm bread pudding caused instant ecstasy as did each subsequent bite. Found myself staring at the bowl just wishing for more stomach room."}
{"text":"The food is wonderful! Everything is fresh, fresh, fresh!! Comfort food!! The rolls melt in your mouth! The quiche is always moist, crust flakey...I have never been disappointed. The servings are plentiful and the prices are very reasonable. The only bummer is that you are so full from your lunch that you do not have room for one of their wonderful desserts!"}
{"text":"Love love love this place!!   So nice to have it back to the original owner recipes.   Rolls and quiche are excellent.  Make reservations as it fills up quickly."}
{"text":"I had the turkey sandwich and it was amazing! My picky 10 year old wanted the quiche and ate the whole thing! I have never seen her do that even with pizza! Great place, so cute the staff was awesome. Wasn't excited about being solicited a total of 3 times during our meal by another shop nearby. That was the only negative experience other than that it was great!"}
{"text":"Excellent food service and atmosphereloved the quaint homelike feel and the tea was wonderful. From the moment you walk in you are treated as s very special guest. The rolls are amazing! Quiche tasted super fresh and flavorful. The staff was outstanding!"}
{"text":"My family and I have been going to The Spicery since 2012 and I'm saddened to say we will not be returning. Over the last few years, we've watched  the quality of their food decrease and the portion sizes of their tea sandwiches and desserts keep getting smaller. The tuna smelled so bad I had to wash my hands. The waitresses are always so sweet, but it has become VERY apparent that the tradition of The Spicery is not being maintained."}
{"text":"We loved every bite of our food.  I was recomended by the nice and seet lady at glendale turist information and went there with my 7 year old daughter for a special lunch.  As soon as we entered the place, we knew we were the right place and soon found out the the service was also superb!  Kids plate was so nutirously balanced and the presentation made my girl very happy and special.  My quiche was very warm and portion was big enough.  The roll was freshly baked at house. Chicken salads was just the way I like it.  Lemonade and raspberry tea were both very fresh.  Our dessert, chocolate cake was moist and rich.  if you are looking for food from scrach, and then you will love their food. We left there with a full of enjoyment and happiness.  The tea house was really cute and nice which will sure make you feel special. Thank you."}
{"text":"**TIP** This place has very limited hours - check their website and make reservations where possible!  We stopped in to The Spicery for lunch today, and I was pleasantly surprised. When I hear 'tea house' I sort of picture a stuffy, girly, frilly place for old ladies and funny hats and little girls playing dress-up.  This place was definitely not that! It felt a lot more like going to your grandparents house for lunch. There are plenty of families and couples, and I did not see any funny hats. The house and the decor just made me think very much of going to my grandmas house, in a good way. It is charming and cozy and comfortable. The chairs are mismatched, the tables have lace tablecloth, there are very old books on all the shelves, and there are decorative plates, china, and tchotchkes in a glass hutch.  I had a pot of Earl Grey tea, and it did not disappoint. It was brewed just a little bit strong, which I really like. They offer small and large pots, and this man was plenty for me, I got quite a few cups of tea out of it and didn't come close to finishing it. For my entrée, I had the special of the day, which was a macaroni and cheese, and it was outstanding. Very rich and filling. It came with a small side salad and a huge, house-made roll. The rolls are baked fresh each day, and you could really tell. They were delicious and fluffy, but still had just the right amount of denseness to them. My husband had a blue cheese and bacon quiche. He thought it was very good, but not quite as good as the Mac and cheese. The filling was good but the crust didn't have quite the bite or crunch we would have hoped for.   For dessert, we tried the blueberry crumble and the pineapple walnut cake. The blueberry crumble was very different than your typical crumble. It seemed like a cross between a vanilla cake and a cornbread. There was none of that crumb/crunchy topping that you typically expect. My husband liked it very much though. The pineapple walnut cake was very rich, and not too sweet, which I liked, but I really didn't get a pineapple taste from it. It was a huge serving though, and I ended up taking half of it home.  Over all, this is a really cute, quaint, fun little place to eat, and I'll definitely bring friends and family back to dine here."}
{"text":"The spicery is one of my favorite places to have lunch or attend a holiday tea party in the quaint town of Glendale. The quiches of the day and homemade bread rolls are a must."}
{"text":"Enjoyed a nice tea party as a babyshower. The fingerfoods provided were yummy! The dessert was very tasty and plenty that a babyshower cake was not necessary. Wonderful set up and sweet waitress. We had a little mishap with the check out, but was resolved nicely. However, if you book a party be sure to get the quote in writing before committing to the date. That is why there was confusion with the cost when the party ended. I have been coming here since I was very young. I adore this establishment and the delicious food."}
{"text":"Loved it. A large group of ladies enjoyed lunch, tea and fabulous desserts. The owner was fabulous. The food was fresh and tasty and the home and atmosphere charming. Looking forward to their breakfast serving soon.   Check it out a lovely way to share a meal with friends. There's an awesome gift shop next door too so don't miss it."}
{"text":"I came with a group for lunch.  It's a nice place to take a date; it's beautiful in an old house in historic downtown Glendale.  The food was ok, took a while to come out and was a bit overpriced for the portions.  I was still hungry after I ate, but it was a nice atmosphere."}
{"text":"The perfect place to take my mother for mothers day...Quaint, little, historical house with a restaurant inside.. Food was delicious. The wait staff was exemplary. The hostess Kelli was her name was awesome, should get a raise."}
{"text":"Stop by & say hello to my longtime friend, Matt Borowski! Delicious food, tantalizing desserts, and  a quiet, intimate decor completes this beautiful spot. Homemade bread from Martha's recipe! The flavors and atmosphere will captivate you & call you softly to return with a friend. I recommend the beef barley soup with turkey sandwich on their homemade bread, and don't skip dessert or you will regret it!"}
{"text":"The Spicery is cute. The rooms in the historic house are well appointed. The service is nice. None of us were wild about the food on the tea menu. It was not bad just average for a tea room. Three of us ordered high tea the fourth ordered off the menu. We were all jealous of her plate. She raved about it. The biggest sin for a tea room was serving TEA BAGS."}
{"text":"The ambiance is really cute - a house that was transformed to a restaurant and a cute patio area.  I had the quiche - I've had quiches before and I do have my fave's so this quiche doesn't even compare in taste and texture.  The server was friendly.  I probably won't be back anytime soon because after all, it is a far drive from downtown Phoenix and there are a multitude of great restaurants around me that I haven't even tried yet."}
{"text":"I came in with a big group to celebrate my grandmas birthday with a reservation. I was so excited the location is really nice and the way they have everything decorated is so great I was in love with everything! I thought it was so cool that we got to try practically all their tea flavors and for the most part all were delicious and I do not even drink tea! Their raspberry hibiscus was my favorite. The food is what brought down my rating. I disliked every single sandwich and their biscuits and lemon bars. Not to mention the sizing is TINY so you will leave hungry. The dessert is delicious especially the brownie! The service is outstanding as well I would just never come to eat."}
{"text":"Wonderful tea shop! We love going for high tea and this place is amazing! We loved the old fashion charm and the lovely tea settings. On paper, the high tea doesn't sound like you get very much. But, we left stuffed and even took some of it to go! The waitress, Patty, and the owner were very friendly and helpful. The owner took the time to personally tell us about and recommend teas for us. He also took time to take our photos in 2 different rooms. Food is delicious. The scones are smaller than other places, but I actually like that better. I feel like I normally fill up on the scone and this was just enough. It was cute and heartshaped. Everything was homemade. Presentation was good too. We've been to most of the tea shops in the Phoenix area and this is by far the best. The only downside was parking. We had to park a block away, but there are cute shops there and we had fun browsing on the way back to the car. Highly recommend! You won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"I really enjoyed eating lunch here. The quiche was so good, I wish I lived closer for more. The rolls were fresh from the oven and served with butter. So yummy! My friend had the chicken over rice which looked good as well. Really cute place and both owners came to check on us. The only thing I wish is the rolls were served with butter and jam. I will come back next time for sure when I am in AZ!"}
{"text":"The Spicery in Glendale is a wonderful gem of vintage Arizona charm! Matt the owner and the staff were so friendly and attentive it was unbelievable, the chicken salad sandwich I ordered was the BEST I've ever had, super fresh ingredients and a great recipe had me wanting to come back and see what else they have in their menu! I would definitely recommend to my family and friends!"}
{"text":"A great venue for eating wonderful, homemade food.  Charming setting, family-owned, friendly staff (even met the chef).  Would not take my grandchildren or husband.  Very much the perfect place to visit with friends while dining on superb food.  Do NOT skip dessert!"}
{"text":"Lunch at the Spicery was the result of a last minute change of plans and I am so glad it happened. It's definitely a place for the ladies at lunch;, old house, with multiple rooms of super charming decor that make you feel like you are at Grandma's. Lunch prices were very reasonable and portions large. Watching calories, I decided to order the chicken salad plate which was delicious. Unfortunately, next to it was this absolutely incredible dinner roll that looked and smelled so good that all willpower was gone. At that point, I figured the diet was already blown so I ordered this wonderfully light cheesecake that was so good I felt obligated to eat every bit. Apparently, the bread pudding is to die for as I noticed other diners ordering only a cup of soup so they could indulge in this giant dessert. Fortunately, this restaurant is situated in Glendale's historic district with lots of cute little shops to walk off my lunch. Not sure if  I will go back for tea but will definitely bring my daughter for lunch."}
{"text":"There were some major wins, like the ambiance, fast service and vegetarian accommodations. Also the scones and shortbread were home runs in our large group. The biggest issue was that our large party was split between two tables. I had asked ahead of time when I made reservations if there was any way they could push tables together or something but they said no. It created separation for us during the lunch especially since another party was sat at another table in the room we were in and it got too loud to try and converse between tables. I hope they create a different set up for larger parties as it seems natural people going together would want to sit together. Also the male host seemed that he was rushing us at the beginning when we were waiting on our guest of honor. I can see what some of the other reviews were saying, I think his demeanor is just interpreted by some as rushed, to the point and not very customer orientated. Sometimes a little politeness or finesse goes a long way. My other gripe is that there was no easy way to remove the tea bags from the pots. Anyone who drinks tea knows that over steeped tea is bitter and not pleasant to drink. It would've helped if they had left the strings on the bag outside the pot or had a utensil to easily remove the bags. I tried fishing them out with silverware and it was tedious. I would come back maybe for a lunch, just not a full tea."}
{"text":"My review is based solely on the attitude and behavior of the male host today - we did not end up eating here so I cannot rate the food (nor will I ever).  I called a week ago to make a reservation for our large party of 10, as I recall back in the day of the \"original\" Spicery that the rooms are tiny and it can get filled up easily at noon. I happened to call 3 minutes after closing in the afternoon but was thankful to hear on their outgoing answering machine message that if I was calling REGARDING RESERVATIONS, to please leave a message and they would take care of it...it beeped and I left my reservation request with my name and phone number (twice/repeated it), stating that if they could not accommodate our large group to please call me back. Never heard anything; fast forward to today when a few of the ladies in our party arrived at 11:55am, the male host was just plain rude to them. She let him know there were now 8 of us for the rez to which he replied, \"we don't have any reservation for you\".  She called me as I was walking over from shopping, and I let her know I had called after hours but they had a recorder and I left it on there so it should be under my name. She repeated it back to the host who was rude and snarky and he said, \"ya, I bet she called\"...\"well I don't have your reservation\".  Sadly, another party that was also waiting had JUST said to my friend, \"I hope they didn't screw up your reservations like they did ours!\"  Apparently, there are ISSUES with taking reservations. So he then said that he could seat us all in 45 minutes if that would work so she said to put us down and we would wait. She told him \"Berks for 8\", and he wrote down \"Birds\".  She said, \"oh it's B-E-R-K-S\" and he brushed her off and said, \"don't worry, I KNOW who you are!\", like HE was pretty much just irritated by all of it, and again rude!!! How he is their frontman, I have no idea! After we all met out front, we discussed it and his behavior and I said forget this place, that is ridiculous! But then half of our party decided that by the time we found a new place and drove to it, it could take at least 30 minutes so let's just wait it out. My friend went back in to confirm he had us down and we were headed to the cute shop next door, and she walked back out and asked the 2 other gals who were standing with her initially and she asked, \"did I tell him 8?\" And they both said yes you did,and she said , \"well he just told me that I did not say party of 8, and that I said party of 6 and he cannot take a party of 8!!\"  I mean, come on!!! He had said earlier that \"someone screwed up the reservations\" but clearly this guy was having a bad day as he not only couldn't correct it/make it right, his first error was in how he treated his customers. No excuse for treating others poorly - I won't be back and I'm pretty sure the other 7 gals feel the same way.  If I was the owner, I would want to know if my staff needed more \"training\" (aka basic human courtesy and respect); if this WAS the owner then WOW, no words.   ***PS - shut off the \"recording\" ability on your voicemail if you're not going to listen to messages that are left (we know we were the 2nd people today who left reservations on there and neither were marked down in your rez book).  I hope your week gets better, Mr Host, and that you have a Merry Christmas."}
{"text":"It's been a while since I've been to this adorable downtown Glendale eatery and it did NOT disappoint.  Our ladies group (of 11) went for lunch today, we all had different items and really not 1 complaint.  The atmosphere is incredible, food and service was outstanding.  You can be sure we will go there again and I myself will go with clients. For such a large group, food was served fast, and with smiles. Don't miss out on this gem in Downtown Glendale."}
{"text":"My friend and I arrived at our reservation time of 11:30 am yesterday and were taken to a separate room where we chose a tea from the list provided on the back of the Afternoon Tea Menu.  We chose the Queen Elizabeth tea. It was delicious.  I wish I had snapped a photo of the flavors in it. The waitress was very sweet and returned often to see if there was anything we needed.  When we finished one course, the next course was immediately brought to the table. Unfortunately. the tea pot was messy, even after we drank more than half the tea, it continued to drip down the spout as we poured the tea. So they should replace the navy blue tea pot. We wanted to pamper ourselves with this treat, but found ourselves also pampered by the staff. By the time we left, the room where we were seated was filled with happy patrons. We visited the shops around the area and left with several treasures; a totally enjoyable day!"}
{"text":"The Spicery, a quaint home steeped in beauty and history.  I've been a resident of Arizona since 1977, and watched this adorable home transition over the decades, frequenting it as a customer over the last two.  First off, I called weeks in advance to get a seating for four on Mother's Day.  I was told that The Spicery was closed on Sundays, and just because it's Mother's Day...they weren't going to be open. So I make a reservation for Monday, May 13th for a tea for four.  When we arrived for our 1:00 PM seating, we were told that we did not make the correct reservation, that because we did not give notice for a \"HIGH\" tea, that we were stuck with the normal lunch menu.  I had made it very clear that we wanted a \"tea\" for four.  Second disappointment.  Then when we went to order, everything we wanted was not available.  The restarant had been opened only two and a half hours since being closed the previous day, and they had \"no soup\" and \"no potato salad\".  When asked what type of teas were available, I was told there was ice tea and lemonade.  Our waitress, dressed in a too small tank top and yoga pants had no knowledge of the menu.  Sweet girl but I can only assume she was very new.  I ordered the broccoli and cheddar quiche, which was less than an inch thick, and had ONE floret of almost brown, shriveled broccoli.  The flat, flavorless quiche was filled with lots of chopped celery and onions.  Almost NO broccoli and very little cheddar.  I believe that was a store-bought crust.  It truly tasted like it.  For dessert, I ordered a creme puff, which was black around the edges.  This delicate pastry had been burned.   The egg-laden custard however was delicious.  This once quaint, exceptional tea house that had us drooling over their delicate finger sandwiches, delectable desserts and teas with notes of spices and fruits...was a massive let down.  There were so many disappointments that there was no way to save the experience for four women scraping the egg custard from a burnt cream puff.  We would have had a better experience going to a chain like IHOP or Denny's."}
{"text":"Wow. The place is beautiful and uniquely decorated.  The food choices are great. Well of course the service is outstanding and the people are wonderful.  I recommend this unique place to all."}
{"text":"I had such high hopes for this place but I left very disappointed and hungry. If you have dietary restrictions, do NOT try this place. All I received was tea, fruit and 4 small pieces of sandwiches and paid $25 just like everyone else. It should be discussed with the customer that they have very little options for people allergic to dairy, beforehand. I would have either opted out of the group rate and ordered off the regular menu or not have gone. I only received about a third of the food options and paid the exact same amount. I'll never spend another dollar at this place. The only reason I'm giving this place 2 stars is because the waitress was fantastic otherwise it would have gotten 1 star."}
{"text":"Beautiful place, and a super sweet family that runs it.. The food is great, and you can't beat the service you'll receive. My Mom goes here faithfully, and they now know her by name. I can tell you the Strawberry and Chicken salad is the best I've ever had! The food is reasonably priced, and the portions are decent.   It's fun to be able to support small local buisnesses, and that's what downtown Glendale is filled with.   I live in San Diego now, but I know I'll be visiting the Spicery next time I'm in town."}
{"text":"I went to the Spicery for th first time and last time 2/28/18. I went with a large group of senior women, we had reaervations.  When we arrived they where running behind, this would have been fine, except for the attitude we received.  The lady in our group, that had made the arangements for us, began to be belittled by the man setting us up.  She had made reservations for 20, not all of arrive on time. So he was wanting to know how many was for high Tea and how many to order off menu. No the problem is he asked her multiple times and she started to get confused. So at one time she had said well we have 16 here and I think we have 5 more coming, now yes that doesn't add up, however he responded well I don't know where you learned math  but 16 and 5 adds up to 21 not 20. Now I'm in the service business, and I would never belittle my customers and expect them to ever come back.  He continued to behave this was and then would appoligize. He was constantly snapping at his help even though she was a good hard worker. At one time I tried to get my pot of tea, he told me he was doing something else and would get it soon! He never did 10 min. Later I had the young lady bring it to our table.  Now I gave them 3 stars because the food was great. Maybe this man would be better placed in the kitchen not out with the paying public, unless he wants to lose more customers. You know the say one unhappy customers can speed the word to millions."}
{"text":"Arrived with a party of 8 for noon reservations .. The man working as a hostess was very rude and said he did not have our reservations .. he said sometimes the person who retrieved the phone reservations messes up.. at the same time they had another party of 6 that they messed up their reservation as well.. the restaurant was crowded and obviously does well so I guess their hostess assumes he can speak rudely to his guest.. Remember sir, it is not what you say, it is how you said it... will not return to this restaurant when there are other establishments where the hostess is a little more polished .."}
{"text":"My absolute favorite tea house.  My family and I have been going for years and used to have our birthday tea parties there.  Between the changing of various owners and when it was forced to close for a couple of years, it's back to the best restaurant for lunch.  3 words:  Homemade fresh rolls.  Delicious, great service, and a great owner that has brought it back to my favorite place to have lunch."}
{"text":"Went to the Spicery for the special Christmas Dinner Saturday the 6th. Very disappointed Ham was lukewarm, red potatoes cold ,grilled vegetables cold. The salad was good the dinner rolls cold. Deserts was good .Service was great too bad the food didn't match service at $23.00 should have been much better. I went last year food was hot and very good. Really  disappointed this year."}
{"text":"I had heard about the Spicery from a neighbor and thought it sounded great.  We were not disappointed!  The home has small, intimate rooms colorfully decorated and homey.  I had called after closing hours but received a return call and the gentleman responder was polite and accommodating.  The menu may be limited but what they offer is wonderful.  It's not Denney's! The greens are crisp and fresh and the pastries awesome.  Service was excellent and the servers were friendly and personable.  We were seated immediately upon arrival and had a wonderful window seating.  Pricing was just right!  Went back a second time and experienced the same wonderful food and service.  Plan on going back with other friends so they can experience this wonderful tea room as well.  Terri M"}
{"text":"Our family really enjoyed our afternoon tea experience at The Spicery. The foods and teas were excellent and the staff were all so pleasant. This is a must do stop for anyone who wants to try something different."}
