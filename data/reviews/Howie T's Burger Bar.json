{"text":"The service and food is great besides for the prick with the beard. But they had some stud redhead who was great he really made up for that bearded shmuck"}
{"text":"Decided to give this place a try since I was in the area. I ordered Howie T's Burger for $3.99 with the Medium fries and drink combo for an extra $4 or so. The burger meat was to my satisfaction and it did hit the spot. I also like the fact that you're able to either order regular fries or spicy fries with the combo and you can choose different types of mayo (loved the garlic mayo!). The only downside is that the place was too cold for my liking and I prefer my burger buns to be toasted or at least warm. I would come back again."}
{"text":"I am giving 4 stars because I've been here numerous times and it's generally quite good or good enough. This time, however, I got the chicken dog (first time) and it was extremely salty. I couldn't even finish it. I also got onion rings which I get a lot and they were good, as usual.  The food is basic burger joint material. Pretty good tasting. Nothing exceptional. Staff is excellent which is always a nice bonus, even if it's just take out."}
{"text":"super cheap, especially considering its kosher. food is delicious and ready within minutes.  they should get more tables and chairs"}
{"text":"I was in the mood for a good burger joint close to my office so where else did I go to find one? Of course, right here.   I discovered \"How We Tease\" based on proximity and rating. And I visited their web site to find great photos of their burgers that incurred a Homeresque drool.  I ordered the standard Howie T's burger, spicy fries and spicy mayo.   Now I know that there is a such thing as exuberant kids behind the condiment bar ready to top your order just the way you like it.  Just visit any Burrito Boyz and you'll see. But this place had a pair of 'em that made it plainly obvious that their brains were focused on something far from making me happy.  I got my burger and waited an additional 5 minutes for my fries to fry.  My total was somewhere in the 9 or 10 dollar range. My friend, however, who ordered the \"Fun Guy Burger\" (I preferred to call it the Fun Boy Burger when he ordered to get under his skin) paid in excess of $18 for his lunch, with a couple extra premium toppings on his burger and a bottle of Coke as opposed to fountain.  I sat down with my lunch and immediately noticed the odd bun. After one bite, I discarded half. It was 4 times the weight and volume of the patty, dense and cold. I could barely taste the flavour of the patty with the carb-monstrosity that surrounded it.  After two bites, the power went out, (I know, I know, not their fault) but we were promptly asked to leave based on safety precautions (something about the gas still running from the grills, yadda yadda).  All and all, not a pleasant experience. Don't let the pics of the burgers on their site fool ya at \"How We Tease\"."}
{"text":"Hands down, worst burger I've ever eaten in my life.  Bland flavourless patty that was certainly bought from the kosher section of the Metro down the street, a thin Kraft single, buns that were cold, stale, way bigger than the patty, and actually tasted bad, McCain's french fries that they didn't even bother to salt, a small coke, and all for nearly $10.    The music was probably the worst goddawful and objectionable wailing that I have ever been subjected to in public.   I'm thoroughly confused by anyone that thinks these prices or food quality are reasonable, since a microwaved burger  from 7-11 has more flavour and is a better value.    I will never go back, and recommend highly for everyone to stay away.  Go to Wimpy's, get 4 times the food and flavour for the same price and with a better atmosphere. Or literally anywhere else that sells a burgers, it is guaranteed to be better than this place."}
{"text":"Great burgers for the money, done very well, and the garlic ketchup and spicy mayo are just bonuses. The spicy fries are amazing! The price is also great but does add up with combos, etc!   Would've been 4 stars but they put one patty on my boyfriends double, at probably one of the slowest times, just before close. We didn't realize until eating at home. Unfortunate. Would go again, but would double-check my order next time!  One cool thing is they have a number you can text to order, so that it's ready when you pick up."}
{"text":"Went here with 3 friends on March 14 around 6:15 p.m. We all ordered basic burgers and fries combos, nothing special, but it took over half an hour to get our food. While we waited, we saw piles of cooked patties off to the side of the grill that could have been prepared. There were a lot of customers in the store, but the employees seemed ill-prepared to deal with the rush (with the exception of one - a tall blonde girl who worked efficiently and seemed to be trying to manage the others).  By the time we got our food, the burgers were ice cold with the texture of an overcooked steak. The buns felt stale. None of us finished our burgers.  The one saving grace was the spicy fries - if you do come here, highly recommend those over the regular fries or onion rings.  I definitely won't eat here again, sorry."}
{"text":"I like this place. A bit out of the way for me, but then again, most places are. I usually end up getting the Fun Guy Burger, well worth it and well worth the money for a kosher burger joint.  Last time I was there I noticed they had a patio which was nice. Wait staff is courteous and prompt, no waiting a long time for food. Kosher burgers in Toronto just got better!"}
{"text":"I think the Vegetarian Force (you know who you are!!) was with me when I was trying to decide what to order...   I saw The Fun Guy Burger (6oz Portobello Mushroom Burger) - $5.99.. and I thought that sounded yummy... since I love Portobello Mushrooms and they do tasted good with burgers.....  I was waitng for my burger to be grilled... oh how I love the charred marks on my patties! I loaded up with the usual condiments and toppings: onion, relish, spicy mayo and hot pepper while I wait for my burger to be cooked on the grill.  My burger looked like a regular burger, I was going to ask where are my mushrooms!! I was eating it and I found that it was quite juicy.. not as dry as the usual ones I have.. hmmmm... when I finish eating my burger.. I was really puzzled... and I went back to read the menu.. it is a VEGGIE burger!! A burger that made with Portobello Mushroom......  So now my first review of a Veggie Kosher burger.. and it was really good.. and I enjoyed that! For the REAL beef Kosher buger.. I will leave that for my Yelp friend to comment on!  The decoration of Howie T's Burger Bar is really dated... giving me a sad depressing feel.... not because I ate a Veggie Burger by mistake that depressed me!"}
