{"text":"I travel for work throughout the US and for pleasure to Europe. Finding good food experiences is a primary goal. H&H is outstanding. From the bone in ribeye, smashed fingerlings and creamed black kale to the grouper, the shrimp cocktail to the bittersweet chocolate almond brownie and espresso ice cream dessert every bite from beginning to end was a great experience. Our waitstaff was great and Michael made it all a delight. And I must mention the cocktails.  Black Flag is a bourbon lovers delight, Gin & Juice a delight. Go H&H. We will return! ( smoking is an art and H&H hits that sweet spot perfectly )
PS: sat at the last table past the kitchen and liked it fine."}
{"text":"Excellent food and drink. Very accommodating even though we had a baby, no reservation and it was very crowded. Happily looking to return."}
{"text":"This new restaurant is definitely the best in downtown willoughby. The drinks are delicious, we both got the French onion soup which is a meal in its own and the best one I've ever had. I got the braised short rib stuffed shells and they were absolutely delicious. Service was perfect and the atmosphere is modern and intimate. I will be back for sure! It's a must visit!!"}
{"text":"7/7/17  update: ok my only complaint is that I can't find as exquisite a meal anywhere else around DTW or lake county. Tonight had the sirloin special coulotte on pan seared potato with grilled asparagus. Charred garlic scape sorfrito purée. WOW!!!  Prosciutto wrapped halibut was also a killer! 

Wow what a great addition to Downtown Willoughby. We had dinner on opening night and were blown away. The Butchers Cut was the best cut of steak I've had since I can remember. The Tomahawk Pork Chop was perfectly cooked as well. Not only Hunter's (Chef) expertise in the kitchen, but Chaz mixing their signature drink creations made the experience one of the best I can remember. Cannot wait to experience the rest of the menu!  Congratulations to Chaz and Hunter on their special vision and unique creation!"}
{"text":"Food was good. Large portions, great flavor. However, there is not a good table in the house. Everyone is cramped and near a busy walkway. Staff did not have knowledge of any food allergies and were not happy to accommodate. Also, they did not keep up with the bathrooms. No towels to dry your hands and the mens room did not lock. For a $200 meal for two people, I want towels in the bathrooms!"}
{"text":"Went on a busy Saturday.  Waited for our first drink to arrive which took much longer than it should have.  We enjoyed the beef cheek toast.  My wife's entree was served 5 minutes before my meal.   Her mahi mahi was under cooked.  When my swordfish arrived it was over cooked.  We never got a chance to order a second drink nor did anyone stop by to enquire how our meals were.  Very disappointing.  On my way to the bathroom another couple was complaining about something and the manager/ waiter was offering a free desert.   Maybe just an off night, but my wife and I won't be back."}
{"text":"It only gets better. Ordered the pot of mussels and clams for an appetizer. WOW!!!! Tasty, fresh, and dipping the bread in the liquid is a meal in its own. I ordered the Tomahawk Pork Chop to go. Meaty, juicy, charred, and way tasty. The horseradish sauce on the side really added a zing to the meat. Prior to meal I had an Absinthe apperitif. Perfect premeal drink."}
{"text":"My wife and I wanted to try a different restaurant and happened on Hook & Hoof.  We made an early reservation yesterday.  We were the first diners there and were seated promptly.  We ordered some cocktails. I ordered the Black Flag, and my wife ordered a Long Island Ice Tea.  Both were done spot on.  My wife and I are not big eaters so we split an appetizer and an entree.

We ordered the Fisherman's Chowder as the appetizer. When it came out the temperature was very tepid, Luke warm at best.  We flagged down the waitress and she promptly said she would take care of it.  She returned in a short while with a new bowl of what I assumed was the Fisherman's Chowder.  It was really delicious, but as we got a couple of spoonfuls we detected the distinct taste of chicken rather than seafood, but did not think any of it, as this was our first visit and taste of the Chowder.  My son and daughter in law also visited this restaurant later on the same evening with some friends and experienced a similar event.  They ordered the zucchini basil soup and instead got the chicken pot pie soup.  They too found the soup to be delicious, but was not what they ordered.
We ordered the butcher's cut which was a double rib of elk prepared medium.  When it came out, I saw that it was not cut in half so could easily share it, but it was no big deal, but as I started to cut through the two ribs  I saw  that it was still bloody red in the middle ( not medium by any Standard) so I once again flagged down the waitress and told her what wrong with the dish.  The dish was returned promptly and it was phenomenal.  The chef came out to apologize personally which I thought was very nice.  
The staff was very friendly and the food was AWESOME!!!
That is why I gave a 4 star rating.  I am planning on going back there very soon as the food was that good.  I hope they work on getting the orders straight the first time, because that would be turn off while dining at a premier restaurant. 
I have included pictures of the restaurant and our meal."}
{"text":"Get here. Now. Exceptional bistro sourcing the finest ingredients from the best purveyors. And an outstanding cocktail program - order the \"Black Flag\" - trust me. Great wines at reasonable prices and a nice \"by the glass\" selection. I had the bone marrow and arugula salad with a wonderful toasted baguette for all of that umami \"meat butter\" - shaved fennel and a nice mustard vinaigrette rounded it out. I also had the bone-in \"tomahawk\" pork chop - beautifully brined and juicy with bacon Brussels sprouts and fingerling potatoes. Top notch!"}
{"text":"6 of us had reservations here one Saturday night back in May (table by the window). This was our first time visiting here and we were excited. While waiting for the table to be set up, a server walked by and dropped a wine glass shattering glass all over where we were standing. It scared me and I had to unbuckle my sandals to see if I had been cut anywhere or had glass stuck. The server that dropped it said a quick sorry but then our actual server was kind of snippy about it and was curt \"well you aren't bleeding are you\". I feel like I should have been offered a more sincere apology. It set the mood and tone of the dinner off as a downer. The food was good though. But I probably won't go back."}
{"text":"Fantastic meal... tomohawk chop was amazing,  cooked to perfection. Fisherman's chowder might be my favorite soup now! Way too go keep up the hard work!"}
{"text":"I've been coming to the greater Cleveland area from LA (on business) for around 10 years now. I started staying in Willoughby because I was always impressed by the quality selection of restaurants in this small little area.

I was delighted to see there were several new restaurants to try since I was here a year ago. It is no exaggeration that I was blown away by Hook and Hoof. I was reluctant at first, perhaps the hipster \"{noun} & {noun}\" naming convention, that has run rampant as of late... but don't let that dissuade you.

I'll cut to the chase. The craft beer selection on tap was great. I started with a Grapefruit Sculpin. Ordered the lamb meatballs starter - loved it. For my main, the tomahawk pork chop, brined in sweet tea. Rivals my favourite place in LA for brined chop (Hatchet Hall). It came with a side of crispy bacon and brussel sprouts. Everything cooked, seasoned perfectly. I'm pretty sensitive to anything slightly over salted and not one complaint here. My main also paired nicely with a pinot noir from Willamette. Shocked to see Willamette pinots on the wine list east of the Rockies and certainly not complaining!

Back again tonight for the \"Butchers Cut\" which is filet today. Fingerling potatoes and creamed black kale accompanying. I could order this dish every night for a month and not grow tired of it. I suppose it helps that kale is my favourite vegetable.

Service was spot on. I happened to meet the owners Chaz and Hunter ok my two visits, both very humble and gracious. Kim the bartender has some great stories too. Ask her about Michael Jordan experience.

I shall continue my crusade to persuade the uninformed to make the journey east to Cleveland. Skip the Symon restaurants in DT, just head to Willoughby."}
{"text":"I was excited to try this restaurant after viewing the stunning menu ! Beautiful atmosphere, fabulous service, a creative menu with such diverse options. My friend started with the poached pear appetizer and I had the \"smoke kissed muscles and clams\". It  was a generous portion and delicious ! My entree was the swordfish with fingerlings and carrots. The entire dish was cooked to perfection ! I felt like I was in NYC at five star restaurant ! I can't say enough good things about my experience you'll have to go and try it for yourself. Here's hoping the Hook and Hoof is around for a long time !!"}
{"text":"I didn't actually get a chance to eat here so this review is based entirely on the rude hostess you have seating people.  I feel if I were a male I would have been treated better."}
{"text":"This place really hits the mark. The drinks were amazing and so different. Pricey for Willoughby but similar to what you would get in the Tremont/Ohio city/flats neighborhoods ( and also quality) . All were hand made with fresh unique ingredients.

The place was a bit on the smaller side with a larger bar. The decor has changed a lot from when it was fannuces! 

We started with lamb meatballs which were moist (which i know is difficult from lamb). The sauce was not too sweet and the toasted bread was perfect to dip in leftover sauce. 4 larger sizes meatballs.

We shared fries and the stuffed shells. Shells were stuffed with a ton of filling but when we were done with the four we wanted more! The pope frites side was huge and the aioli was interesting- its sweet which I wasn't expecting but went well with the fries.

I would love to return to try other items. I heard the toast appetizer is great and would love to try to seafood items."}
{"text":"We where in Willoughby for the car show and happened to be walking by H&H. We asked the hostess if they had any opening since the bar was packed, and luckily they had a cancellation and were able to accommodate us. We didn't know how lucky we were. 

I had the Smoked Mussels and Clams, and the aroma was the most intoxicating smell I have had in a long time. Presentation was amazing, and the taste was refined and rustic at the same time. For the entree I had the NY Strip with creamed Kale and Fingering potatoes. The steak was cooked like I asked for (Med. Rare) and the Kale was better than any creamed spinach I have ever had. The potatoes was cooked perfectly and had this crunch for a great texture contrast. It was coated in a sauce that pulled it all together. The service was top notch and the drink were good too, delicious and perfect for a hot and steamy day. 

Bravo H&H, I will be back!!!!"}
{"text":"Wonderful! Service was great for my dad's birthday. No free dessert though. Elk chop is amazing and has the best sauce. 3 of us got the pork chop and among 5, they were all finished! Last dish was the steak and frites. This was okay. Definitely not a show stopper like the other two. 
The soup of the day was a beef barley and it was sooooo good. The dessert was an amaretto cherry pistacio bread pudding thing with ice cream. One of the best desserts I've ever had!
Great new restaurant. My parents have already been three times."}
{"text":"Superb meal, attentive service, stupendous bourbon--we couldn't have been more pleased!  I started out with an old-fashioned & hubby went with a Troegs Javahead stout...Sarai, our server, delivered them promptly as she cheerfully advised us on the menu.  So glad I had the poached pear salad, it was truly fresh with a perfect blend of ingredients.  Hubby raved about his swordfish; I kept exclaiming how delicious the scallops were with each bite.  Sarai was very knowledgeable as well as warm & friendly.  For dessert, we could not resist the holy grail of bourbon: Pappy van Winkle.  We each had a pour of the 12 year old!  Worth every penny!  We can't wait to work our way through the menu."}
{"text":"What a wonderful addition to the east-side food scene! Hunter (chef) and Chaz (cocktail menu or 'bible' design) have a modern-American take on food and cocktails. We started with the Black Flag - holy cow!  This incredible drink is made with aged bourbon and finished with chocolate bitters.  Other highlights for us included the braised beef cheek toast, short rib stuffed shells and the fillet (cooked to a perfect med-rare). The creme brûlée cheesecake was an awesome way to finish. If you are looking for a casual-sophisticated place for dinner and/or cocktails, we highly recommend Hook & Hoof!

Tip - make a reservation, they sold out both weekend nights and were actually turning people away at the door."}
{"text":"We were looking for a place to have a quick bite to eat after a movie and we thought we'd give Hook & Hoof a try.  We didn't think it would be too busy on a Tuesday night but we were wrong!  The restaurant was busy and there weren't any tables to be had so we decided to sit at the bar.  There was also a chef's table (a counter overlooking the kitchen) with seating but we picked the bar -- that was a mistake.  The bartender was understandably busy but it took him quite some time before he cleared the dirty dishes and empty drink glasses from in front of us.  Finally he handed us a drink menu and took our order.  My husband had a beer and I tried the Corpse Reviver.  It was delicious!  And it lived up to it's name -- very strong!  It was a little odd that the bartender only gave us one glass of water between the two of us. I kept waiting for him to set down another glass but no luck. That's okay, I guess we'll share.  For dinner I ordered the Airline Chicken Breast and my husband ordered the Short Rib Stuffed Shells.  My husband's meal came out after a reasonable amount of time but my meal was no where to be found.  Finally after about 15 minuets, the bartender brought my meal over.  We enjoyed both the meals but, all in all, the service just really ruined the night.  This was unfortunate since the atmosphere, drinks and food were all good which is why I gave it three stars and not less.  Not sure if we'll go back but, if we do, we'll be sure to make a reservation."}
{"text":"Nice atmosphere, rustic and cozy. Drink menu is a large leather-bound book with signature cocktails on the first page. We had an Erie st 11, and the black flag- both were delicious. There didn't look like a ton of seating, but we just sat at the bar. For food we were told we HAD to try the braised beef cheek toast, so we did and it was delicious. The bread by itself was just a little dry, but the meat was tender and flavorful!  We also grabbed The Lamb belly meatballs, which are phenomenal. This also came with 2 long pieces of toasted bread (French or baguette), but again, didn't eat them. 

  For dinner I had the short Rib stuffed shells and I could only eat half of one cause I was already full! I ate them for leftovers the next day and I think they were even better!! My friend took home the swordfish and scallops for his family and stated he was very impressed! 

We'll definitely be back to try out the rest of the menu!"}
{"text":"My husband and decided to celebrate our special  anniversary at Hook and Hoof after hearing many positive things about the restaurant and food. After ordering drinks we ordered dinner and the Cesar salad. As the salad was served we asked if there was any bread. The person who served the salad brought out 2 mini corn muffins with maple butter. When our entrees came we asked the waitress if we could have some  more muffins. She said that management will not allow her to give more as they only make enough for each table. While this seemed strange, we asked her if she had any bread. She replied that in order to get bread we would need to order the mussels. At this point we did not say anything more. We have NEVER been to a fine upscale restaurant where they portion out bread or muffins. Our bill was over $110!   While the food was good this action by the waitress left a bad taste in our mouth. We will not be back."}
{"text":"This is our favorite date spot in DTW. Such a beautiful environment, incredible drinks and delicious food. Great add to the neighborhood."}
{"text":"Have been waiting for the Hook and Hoof to open for months now and we finally got to go last night.  What a treat and welcome addition to Lake County dining.  We sat at the Chef's window and enjoyed watching the kitchen preparations.  It also allows you to see the food before you place your order and we really loved that.  The star for us was the appetizer, smoked clams and mussels in coconut milk broth.  I do not normally eat clams, but these were so tender and flavorful, I could not get enough of them.  
I also had the fish chowder and creamed kale which were also very tasty.  My husband had the pork chop and he raved about that dish as well.

Our server was very nice and helpful when asked questions.  My only complaint was I requested my soup and side to come out when my husband's entree was served, but it came out about 15 minutes before. When the pork chop did come out, I asked for it to be reheated.  They took it back and prepared a new one totally.  (Being at the chef's window, I saw it being done). Kudos for that.The kitchen was a bit backed up but being in the first month of opening, this is understood. We got to meet Hunter and Chaz, the co-owners, who were very interested in how things went. 
We will definitely be back soon and look forward to trying more dishes. I do not eat beef or pork, so I am very happy that there are several seafood choices and well as vegetarian options."}
{"text":"Great setting, excellent food. We shared lamb belly meatballs, arugula w bone marrow salad and the very tender and flavorful filet w smashed potatoes and roasted carrots. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"This place is amazing. I ordered the fresh catch which was Mahi Mahi and it was unreal. I had a Black Flag cocktail. Hey his place is a hidden secret and by putting in his review I fear I might loose my seat at the bar. You are doing yourself a disservice if you do not check it out."}
{"text":"Unfortunately, acoustics aren't the best. It overshadowed the experience. We sat towards the bar area and a large party. Even after the bar cleared out, the sound was still overpowering and loud. You cannot hear the waitress or have conversation with friends & family without having to  yell or speak loudly. 

Food -
Positives: Burger, pork chop, scallops all good.
Negatives: Risotto had a salty & starchy taste to it and Farro stew with salmon was bland.

For the price, just wasn't worth it for our group. There are other options in the area to enjoy a quiet meal and have conversation."}
{"text":"Finally a place in DTW other than a Gastropub/Bar food.  This place has well thought out and imaginative dishes.  Short Rib stuffed shells were rich and delicious but not heavy.  Seafood chowder is very good.  Poached Pear salad was excellent.

Decor is nice, good vibe.  

What sets this place totally apart is the Cocktail Program.  There is no restaurant or bar in Lake County that can mix a better cocktail.  They have an extensive Whiskey selection as well.  

Service was very friendly and accommodating, but there are some kinks to work out, which is to be expected for a brand new operation.

Overall, I am impressed and happy that this place opened."}
{"text":"I read about this place opening and checked out the yelp reviews.  I made the trek out to willoughby for the first time just to try it.  It was one of the best meals and date dining experiences I've had in the last couple years, at least in Ohio.  I'm a huge foodie, and this place definitely met my expectations.  The food was well executed (though I do have a few constructive comments/questions) and flavorful.  The service was also very attentive but not overbearing.  The staff was friendly and able to answer questions.  It sounds like they will be opening for lunch in the coming months, and I hope that menu is as creative for lunch as it is for dinner!  I'm sure it will be.  Well done!"}
{"text":"Perfect every time 

I have been there during the week and weekends and I can't say enough great things 

The creativity of each dish is amazing and the service is very high quality 

Love this place will be back to try the specials"}
{"text":"My wife and I are disabled with a service dog,plus we had my son and and assistant. Chaz, one of the owners was awesome to accommodate us! All our food was spot on! It's a do over!"}
{"text":"Soooo.... we had to go back a few days later because we just couldn't wrap our head around how good our first experience was. Well, the second time was even better! This time we sat at the bar and started with their shrimp cocktail. Some of the biggest, freshest shrimp we've had in a very long time. Especially up north. The cocktail sauce was so phenomenal, unlike anything we've ever tried. We actually used our bread to soak up the extra cocktail sauce! The special was a smoked wild boar over cornbread and succotash with cream sauce. This dish blew us out of our chair. The presentation was amazing, looking like a work of art. But the flavors eclipsed the beauty of the dish. I'm hooked! Thank God for this little gem of a restaurant. Again, well done."}
{"text":"I was visiting from out of town and was told a new restaurant had opened in DTW. We decided to give them a try on a Friday evening around 7pm.
First thing we noticed when we arrived was they were still a little unorganized and awkward when seating us. Once seated the filling of our waters was also awkward... chalk that up to the first week of being opened. We then noticed the music was uncomfortably loud. We were having a difficult time having a conversation. We asked for the volume to be reduced which they did, and everything ran smooth after that. 

They have an extensive cocktail list and a decent craft beer selection. The beer list is missing prices and the waitress couldn't tell me how much the beers were?...
The food is what saved this place.

I had the short rib stuffed shells. They were absolutely hearty, filling and tasty. My only qualm was the temperature when it arrived was not as warm as I would have hoped. Tasty none the less.

My wife had the ravioli which was the show stopper. Super delicious. The sundries tomatoes with the truffle oil was amazing.

My father had the burger which I almost ordered and I am glad I did not. It was tasty and had so much potential... but the overcooked the hell out of this thing. He asked for medium rare and got Alamo well done. No pink at all, no juiciness. Shame, but like I said. It has the potential. 

For the starter we had the beef cheek toast. Very tasty and we were happy with it.

My wife also had the chowder which was very filling as well.

This place has great potential and a lot of these issues are due to how new they were. I am confident they will iron the kinks out which is why I give 4/5 stars"}
{"text":"Finally had the opportunity to eat at H&H and went with some out of town guests as well. We ordered multiple dishes and I tried several of them. Even the ones I didn't try though were yummy to the eye! The menu is creative with a wide variety of ingredients and flavors, so even though many state it's a small menu, it is actually vast in my opinion. Then also, what they do, they do right. 

The interior of the building is taken down to natural brick on the walls with a visible kitchen behind glass windows, a small bar area and then multiple tightly placed rustic casual tables. They do have a couple tables that can seat six, but expect to reserve these well in advance and be squeezed in. It's definitely a cozy, social type feel. The acoustics can be loud. The service is professional and knowledgeable but not at all stuffy.  

The wine, beer and cocktail lists are all top notch. Ingredients for the drinks and food are all fresh and well thought out. 

The best item we all tried was the fisherman's chowder. I highly recommended this! The burger was over cooked as was the swordfish, but the flavors on the plate saved the dishes. The salmon also appeared over done, but I didn't try it, so I don't know. They do seem to like to cook the heck out of their meats and fish  for some reason. The scallops looked perfectly cooked and the sweet tea brined pork was acceptable as well. The beef short rib shells, well short ribs can braise all day... All in all, there wasn't a dish we tried that wasn't delicious. The complimentary bread was a blue corn bread with maple butter and was perfect with the menu. Each main dish came accompanied with veges and a starch in some form, except the beef shells, they were topped with cheese and a sauce and was a heavy dish for those who like that. All the veges were perfectly seasoned, sauced and cooked. 

The prices were, as others have stated, a bit high, even for the caliber of food, and for the price, they're inconsistently over cooking some of the dishes it appears. This is a different type of restaurant than others in this area though, and I love the addition to the area!"}
{"text":"PROS
-Authentic ingredients. When possible or when in season, ingredients are sourced locally, meaning fresh and quality food. And this goes for the drinks too! Everything that was in our drinks was made in-house.
-Good dishes. I got the short rib stuffed shells. I really enjoyed it! Probably could have done without the shells - it was just the vehicle for the good stuff. 
-A diamond in the rough. I have not been impressed with many of the downtown Willoughby restaurants in terms of food quality and overall ambiance, so this is a welcome addition to the scene.

CONS
-Limited menu. I suppose with limited ingredients comes a limited menu selection. I think there were only 4 starters on the menu? I hope that they add a few more choices in the future because everything we tried was very tasty!
-Space and sound. This restaurant is very narrow and very small. I am surprised that the wait staff can even get through to the tables in the front. On top of the small size of the space was the noise that resonated throughout. It was hard to talk to my friends sitting across the table from me.

BOTTOM LINE
Saddle up and squeeze in to Hook & Hoof for a good meal and great time!"}
{"text":"2nd visit here and the food is wonderful.  They are the only place I have found that serves an elk steak.  The elk is some of the a best steak I have had.  

The only complaint is that the portions are a little small and the bar staff seemed a little new and unsure of themselves."}
{"text":"My wife and I went last night for the first time. I had on of the crafted Bourbon drinks make with Eagle 10yr Bourbon. So smooth, I had to have another. We then split the Caesar salad that was very tasty. Not a plan Jane Caesar, but one with a lot of cheeses, bacon, etc.  my wife elected to have the swordfish off the menu and loved it. I went with the hoof special, a slow cooked boars meat with a light but right amount of a Carolina type BBQ sauce served on a corn muffin on top of a bed of succotash. I know succotash, but this was really good. Can't wait to take friends!"}
{"text":"Not sure how we happened to stumble upon a 7pm reservation, as after dining here, I can't imagine it will be easy to grab a table at this unbelievable restaurant. Probably some of the best food I've EVER had.

Apps: shrimp and artichoke fondue with baguette. Full of shrimp, creamy, savory goodness. Excellent paired with a cab or smokebomb drink.

Entree: scallops with butternut squash risotto- which could be the best meal I've ever had in my life (I'm talking better than seafood in Maui good). My boyfriend had the pork chop which was tender, cooked to perfection, side with fingerling potatoes and bacon Brussels sprouts. Wow- perfect side dish with this incredible huge portion of pork slab.

Dessert: snickerdoodle blondie with caramel ice cream and candies pecans. My mouth is drooling remembering how delish this dessert was. 

I didn't think RPM steak in Chicago could be topped but this place does it and at more than half the price. Get a reservation and get ready for an incredible dining experience!"}
{"text":"Wow. I am thoroughly impressed. Hands-down the best restaurant in this part of town. Absolutely no competition. From aesthetics & ambiance to food & drinks to service & price point - this place is perfect. I'm so thankful for this new addition to DTW, because DTW desperately needed an updated, date-worthy, splurge-worthy, restaurant - and this place fills that void. Finally something other than a gastropub or a \"restaurant\" that turns into a full-blown \"bar\" as the evening progresses. 

Husband and I made reservations - which I would encourage. We were promptly seated at a table near the kitchen. We both ordered mixed drinks from the extensive and creative menu. Husband had a Retox and I had the Southern Belle - both were served quickly, in cool glasses, and were refreshing, herby/fruity, thoughtful perfection. True craft cocktails. We were served rosemary beer bread to start along side our drinks (complimentary). It was fresh, warm, and herby. Hearty, but fresh. So good.

We started with the braised beef cheek toast (local goat cheese, poblano cranberry compote, wild mushroom, local honey). HOLY SMOKES! What a first impression to the food! First of all, the portion was HUGE. Way larger than we were anticipating, and would easily serve four. We honestly almost saved half because we were nervous we would be pretty full by the time our meals came. But it was so. dang. delicious. that we couldn't stop. The meat was tender, the cranberry was sweet, and the goat cheese was tangy. I could eat this as my meal. And for the price, c'mon now, I would have expected to be charged twice as much for this based on the serving size... this is amazing & stunningly inexpensive for the quality.

For dinner, I had the shortrib stuffed shells. If you see pics and are worried about the serving size of 4 shells - don't be. These are FILLING. They are filled to the max with shortrib. The tomato burgundy demi was the perfect base. I could eat about 1,000 of these, although not in one sitting. I ended up taking 2 home with me - and they reheated well for lunch the next day. No doubt I would have cleaned my plate if I hadn't eating so much beef cheek toast.

My husband and the osso bucco special of the night, which was served over polenta. He must have exclaimed 20 times during the meal how delicious it was, and about the tender meat. The presentation was artful.

We planned on ordering dessert, but we were way too full. Perhaps next time, because we are 100% sure we will visit again. I can't wait to try more of the menu, and the service was spot-on. The place is really cool, trendy (but still unpretentious), and a breath of fresh air in the sea of bar food that is DTW.  

This place absolutely deserves all the great reviews it's getting. Kudos to the crew at Hook & Hoof - you've done a stellar job with the drinks, menu, service and ambiance. This place knocks it out of the park, and we're grateful to welcome you to the neighborhood!"}
{"text":"This may be the best overall dining experience in all of cleveland- certainly in Willoughby. Between the Awesome bartenders and friendly staff, the perfectly made legit cocktails and the food-- I don't even know where to start, we loved everything-- and the food... is just phenomenal. Drinks were top notch, we tried then whiskey sour, aviator and old fashioned- all made perfectly. The beef toast is highly recommended to start (bonus the serving is huge). For entrees we can't get enough of the Stuffed shells, the steak and the infamous pork chop- it comes on the bone and will just melt in your mouth (you will finally experience how pork is actually supposed to be cooked!!!) If you're going to try one place visiting in willoughby, this should no doubt be it."}
{"text":"My wife and I made reservations here for our anniversary.  Upon entering the restaurant, we were hit with a smell of fish/seafood (like at a fish market) at the entrance and they had a fan going so they must be aware of it and trying to counteract the smell.
Kim T. was our server and she did a great job and was very friendly.  We shared a bottle of Chardonnay and started off with an appetizer of smoked clams and mussels which had great flavor and we dipped the bread which was served with it in the broth.  My wife had the Butchers Cut steak and I had the pork chop and both meals were delicious.  Our first time there, but we'll definitely be returning.  
Note: It is a little loud, but not unbearable."}
{"text":"Oh I had the elk steak and it was amazing! I can't say anything bad about the place. Service, food and ambiance!"}
{"text":"I am not going to go into detail, though it would benefit Chaz if I did. Suffice to say I just left Hook & Hoof. Four of us are in agreement. If there is a better restaurant I n DTW, it is in someone new dream; because this is the best food, drink & service I have had in a long one time."}
{"text":"Dinner was absolutely amazing. We ordered the tomahawk porkchop and the butchers cut - which happened to be ELK - It was like heaven in my mouth. The service was great, the drinks were incredible (we both ordered the cartel) the atmosphere was great! We left extremely happy!"}
{"text":"We went early to beat the evening crowd and our food was super quick to come out. Everything we ate was high quality food and well plated. 

The drink options had a lot of thought put into them and they make some of their own mixers fresh. Service was just right. I can't think of a single thing to complain about. I will definitely return."}
{"text":"I'm hooked on Hook! While visiting from out to town we had dinner here with our family, really nice ambiance and our server was top notch, helpful, since we had a couple of children, and very pleasant! It's nice for this Kentucky boy and his Kentucky family to visit an establishment with such nice cocktails made from Kentucky bourbon and such a large selection of bourbons this far north! Made me feel at home and the hoof made me think of Kentucky thoroughbreds! We had pork chop, scallops, burger, and mussels, and all were excellent. Nice place for a nice meal."}
{"text":"Great place. We will def. be back. There were 6 of us and everything was great. Fun place with great  food. A nice addition to DT Willoughby. If you are into Bourbons this is the place- amazing selection."}
{"text":"The service was great and the stuffed shells were amazing! I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"There is something so special about this place. It's tucked away in a charming little town but Hook & Hoof stands as a modern, trendy, and very sophisticated restaurant serving impeccably garnished drinks and delicious, reinvented meals all night. The salads are fresh and plentiful, the pork and fish dishes are delicate and soft, the ravioli is absolute perfection, and the mussels and clams are delightful and the presentation will make any instagram photo a success. The service is wonderful here and I suggest taking your time enjoying dinner because the ambiance is warm, rustic, romantic, and just so tastefully decorated."}
{"text":"Went in for a quick Bite last night!! Pork Chop was one of the best I have ever had!! Dirty Caesar was just ok, i wasnt a huge fan of the dressing. But to each there own.. Salad was very Fresh.  Cant wait to go back and try more!! Definately Recommend the Pork Chop if you go, a must try"}
{"text":"This is by far the best restaurant on the East Side. You really can't go wrong. Start off with the fisherman's chowder. My favorite entree's are the Tomahawk Pork Chip and the Double Bone-in Elk Steak. The burger is also Amazing. Make sure you ask your server if there is anything special not on the menu. Finally, the bartenders are A+. They make great cocktails. My favorite is their Manhattan. If you like Bourbons their selections have to be top 5 in the state. They have some rarity's like Pappy Van Winkle. This my favorite restaurant in Northeast Ohio right now."}
{"text":"One of my favorite places. All meals are awesome. Can't wait to go back. Chaz is awesome."}
{"text":"Made a reservation for a Monday night because my wife and I were passing through town on our honeymoon. We each got a cocktail (the Tortuga for myself and the Bardstown Fire for the lady), shared a salad (Poached Pear), and two entrees (Tomahawk Pork Chop and the Wild Mushroom & Artichoke Ravioli). The food and service were more than adequate, however the overall price seemed high; the tab was nearly $100 pre-tip. While we didn't partake, the wine bottle list is a great value. As for the atmosphere the front half of the restaurant was showing the Indians game so it was difficult to distinguish what the concept was: high-end dining option or a sports bar. Both options are great, just maybe not together. 

Highlights: Poached Pear Salad. So delicious."}
{"text":"Went here for cocktails and drinks last night. Great decor inside all the way down to the bathrooms. Waiter was attentive and suggested drinks based on our tastes. Food was delicious although I only tried one dish, the ravioli, which was delicious. Would definitely return to sample more menu items."}
{"text":"This place is a great addition to Downtown Willoughby! The food is amazing and the cocktails are unique and delicious. The atmosphere is also very warm and classy and perfect for a date night!"}
{"text":"We went when it first opened.  We were sat at one of the worst tables I have ever experienced. It was this dark hallway between the kitchen doors and the bathroom. Yuck! The food was pretty good but the atmosphere was awful."}
{"text":"Wifey wanted to go for drinks and appetizers.  Found The Wild Goose, but due to a fund raiser this weekend,  they were packed and loud so we walked across the street to Hook & Hoof.   We were so glad we did.   Fantastic.   I'm afraid it's her new favorite.   She  started with the Fisherman's Seafood Chowder.  Only let me try a little piece of bread dunked in it.   I had Smoked Clams and Mussels.    The bits of bacon at the bottom of the bowl were and added treat.  Definitely the best clams & mussels I've had in a while.   For 2nd appetizer she had the Special of the evening Beef TarTar and I had the Beef Cheek. Toast.   Both killer!!    They have only been open for 3 months but by hearing conversations at the bar there have/are a number of repeat customers  in attendance."}
{"text":"When you go here to eat drink and socialize you will see staff you might know. The staff is very friendly and responsive to you questions and requests.  
Example:  I like to try foods I may never have had before. I was starving this night and I was pondering this belief. Do I go with something I have never had and possibly get a dish that it dreadful or do I get a dish that is safe and a time tested filling dish.  Yep I swung for the fence. I got the Elk chops. Never had Elk period but it was fantastic. It was so tender and full of great taste. It was a special there this night and it was great see my pic.  
My Wife has the scallop's and they two was good as I borrowed one permanently. 
Hope this helps everyone especially for everyone to try something new.  All I can say is I hit  a grand slam tonight."}
{"text":"First let me say the food is fabulous! No question about that. The beef cheek toast starter is beyond fabulous. My less than 5-star rating is because last night something was very very wrong with the AC. We were a group of 8 & were horribly hot & uncomfortable. Asked our server & her answer included hoping to get more floor/portable units and something about vent up by the ceiling. So at this point we don't know if the AC is insufficient due to bldg age or if it was on the fritz. Again, the food is wonderful but gotta say as of this time will avoid going in warm weather till things are resolved. They even propped the door open but I'm pretty sure that's a health code issue. As I said we were a group of 8. One meal came out. Yes, only one. Ten min later 3 more. Then 2 more. Six were eating while 2 of us waited and waited.  Oddly I was one of the 2 who were last & had ordered the very same meal as the very 1st one that came out. Seems you could make 2 of same dish on the same ticket. The last 2 meals came out one at a time 6-10 min apart.  Not good.  It's also very hard to hear each other because acoustics are bad. Have a decibel reading app and it was way up in high 80-90 red zone. Have always hated reviews that weren't discussing the food & svc but we were so, so very hot. Hope things get fixed. Will happily update review."}
{"text":"So I was finally able to find time to get into this place for dinner. WOW, I was so impressed with the entire experience. I absolutely loved every plate that came out of the kitchen. We had two apps, three entrees, and four drinks of their perfectly created drink menu. These two guys have put together a experience like nowhere else. Congrats to these two for really loving what they do. Because every bit of the passion and love for a good meal is brought out on every plate."}
{"text":"Okay, bad info out of the way. We were sat at the last table past the kitchen. Bad accoustics, loud, and somewhat warm. If possible, avoid sitting here at any cost. Now the meal.

In short,  one of the BEST dinners my wife and I have had.  Linda started with the pear salad, while I chose the seafood chowder. Salad was large and fresh. Linda loved it.  The Fisherman's chowder.....OMG!! This will be the standard from now on.  Served hot, and the aroma was immediate!  Great portion and many pieces of clams, scallops, and cod. Spicy to the taste and could be a meal by itself.  Don't toss this around, but GOAT!! A must order. 

The main dishes also did not disappoint. I ordered shortrib stuffed shells, while Linda had the Wild Mushroom and Artichoke Ravioli. Again,  both were served hot and we couldn't wait to dig in.  We traded with each other and we both said each dish was perfect. Also were had sides.  Me, pomme frites and Linda the Brussels sprouts (no, I did not try her side, and never will!). Both of us delighted in taking a good portion home for another meal. 

It's nice to know a GREAT restaurant is located so close to home and is worthy of a trip out east to Lake County, no matter where you call home!!"}
{"text":"I haven't had a good meal in the area for quite some time until we came here.  We got the shrimp cocktail, 4 perfectly made drinks (whiskey sour was my favorite) and the pork chop, which was amazing!  Homemade creme brulee cheesecake to end the evening.  Great atmosphere and service and delicious food."}
{"text":"Excellent drink service!  Rarely have I been able to find a restaurant bartender in NE Ohio who pays attention to the way drinks should be made and flavor developed within them.  I'm a fan.

The food is very pleasantly surprisingly good as well.  Huge portion sizes, meats cooked to perfection, the smoked clam and mussels appetizer was so delicious.  We'll be back to try other menu items."}
{"text":"A simple name and yet a very eclectic menu. If you're looking for a steak or a selection of fish, this is not the place. Everything is over-thought, ridiculously complex and a waste of time. Lamb belly meatballs?  Are you kidding?  A Cesar salad served as a half wedge with a poached egg and hot dressing?  Again, are you kidding?  Not to mention that the seating is so tight that you have to drop into your chair from above. Get rid of one table. It would help. Ended up with a burger that tasted great but couldn't overcome all of the other annoyances. Try a different place"}
