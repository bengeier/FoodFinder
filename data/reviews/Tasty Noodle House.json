{"text":"Yes names changed a few times ..Kenny delight was good. United brothers was a bit scary. But the Tasty Noodle is a good dinner place. 
Why? The fish tank is still there, filled with talipia, lobster and clams. 

So it gave me the confidence to go for dinner. 
Also it was crowded with people. In the competitive First Markham food markets , it tells me that it is good. 

We went there a few times for dinner.. The best deal is the package dinner . We usually ordered the one with 3 options : free range chicken , steam fish and vegetable with mushrooms 

It costs less than $30 for all 3 dishes which includes a complimentary home made soup and a dessert (alright it is a very Chinese style green bean soup) .. The servers will give you another dessert sometimes..

The fish is fresh , chicken is good..
Also they have a beef tenderloin with wasabi is great too..

The servers' experience varies but they are always courteous and attentive. 

So my take is : go there for a home made meal , don't expect the western ambiance and chic atmosphere...

Pd the first markham place used to have more dinner choices but one it is crowded with Korean restaurants (I like Korean food but 4 restaurants in one block limits my choices) 

Good food, cheap price, good value!  Great for a family outing"}
{"text":"Tasty Noodle House is located in First Markham Place.  It is the same location that  Kenny's.delight was located  Once you walk in you wouldn't know the differences as the decor is the exact same as Kenny's and the restaurant that was here before Tasty.  

Food is well priced and portion size is average.  There were plenty of servers but they were just talking and doing their own things.  It was hard to get their attention at times.  

Ordered this cream sauce spaghetti and baked porkchop on rice and they were decent.  The Milk tea at Tasty is pretty good too.

{"text":"The 3 of us always goes here to have the two people set dinner! It cheap and tasty and have a variety of selections. One of my favorites it's the eggs and shrimp! Their eggs aren't dried out like the usual places have and they have complimentary soup and dessert. Tasty noodle but we never get the noodles"}
{"text":"Congee Wong being under renovations, we went next door.  We'd been here before for Chinese fare.  Tonight we decided to go with their Hong Kong cafe (Asian version of western fare).  The baked cheese grouper spaghetti was tasty, but we wish we had more sauce, and not gooey sauce.  The grouper had WAY too much batter and tasted almost nauseatingly greasy.  The Portuguese sauce mixed veg was what could have lowered it to 2 stars.  Very little veggies, and the so called sauce was made with neither curry nor coconut - it just had the COLOR of Portuguese sauce, and that, my friends, does not count.  Their Chinese fare based on one past visit was better.  That's why this isn't a 2-star joint.  The verses they had for Chinese New Year were very neat - see my pix if you read Chinese.  If you don't, I'm sorry - it's impossible to translate.  OH and they accept credit cards, but only if it's above $20.  Otherwise, they charge a fee.  I hate that - so chintzy!  I paid cash."}
{"text":"Passed by here while heading to First Markham Place's food court, and had been attracted by the sign of \"afternoon tea at 2pm\".    This place is used to be my fave noodle place; Kenny's noodle.  Haven't been popping in since Kenny's changed hands.  Friends have been recommended this place, and saying that their dinner is good!  The decor reminded me of Kenny's once I stepped in.  The server was friendly and gave us the menu for afternoon tea right away.  We had the chicken burger with fries and chicken and ham spaghetti in cream sauce; both $4.99 each including drinks.  The chicken was crispy and the bun was toasted just right.  The topping of lettuce and tomato were crisp and there was right amount of mayo.  I was actually just wanted to have a bite but finally I had finished half of it, and leaving the spaghetti nearly untouched - no more hassle cooking tonight :p They are having special on lobster; $10.99/lb!!  Afternoon tea ranging from $2.99 to $6.99 includes drinks.  Good deals....... yummy food ......... excellent service!!"}
{"text":"This place seems to change names frequently.  Decor still looks the same though, and same layout.  Last couple times we really enjoyed the crab rice, but now that they changed the name our favourite dish just isn't the same.  It now lost flavour and spice, and the few crab pieces are breaded.  On the up side, they still serve each table with free soup and dessert.  You may need to ask for it in case they forget.

Still a great place though for cheap HK style food.  Though parking may be a bit of a hassle during evenings/weekends at First Markham Place . Open late for those hungry late at night. 

They do have some reasonably priced lunch/afternoon specials for $4.99 and I would come back again to try these."}
{"text":"This place is a pretty basic Chinese restaurant, similar to Congee Queen, or like its' former namesake Kenny's delight. I showed up here after a long day, and was just looking for something to eat - and this place was one of the few places that was still serving food @ 10:30 at night on a Tuesday night.

Their Cart noodles are a great cheap deal and it wasn't too bad either for approximately $5.00+ tx. They offer a few different toppings; you can choose 2 of out a list of 8. Plus they have stewed turnips coming with it as garnish. I got curry fish balls, plus a fried egg. Flavor wise not too bad, but I think the soup base could have been better. To supplement, I also ordered their XO sauce fried radish cake comes out pipping hot and pretty good, but not much XO sauce though with it. 

Service -wise the place isn't bad. The manager is actively on the floor and interacting with customers. They did mess up my order in regards to the choice of noodles, I asked for Rice noodles and they have given me regular noodles, but they didn't make a fuss when I pointed out the error and replaced it right away more or less with the correct noodles. 

Plus they have a bunch of other specials, all day and breakfast too.

Overall, not a bad experience if you just want a straight up no-frills meal."}
{"text":"Meh. I still miss Kenny's Noodle.

Despite that, this place was worth a shot. I came here for a light lunch and ordered the do-it-yourself noodle (I don't like calling it \"car\" noodles, if you get that reference). They have a lot of items to choose from, so just pick two (or more), pick your noodle, and you're all set.

I had the default noodle option with red sausage and curry squid. The default noodle tasted okay, but it didn't really mix in with the broth that well. The red sausage actually tasted very good! The curry squid was nothing special, and nothing of curry remained after putting it in the broth.

Iced lemon tea was decent. No general complaints there."}
{"text":"I think I get confused too easily..

Kenny, United Brother and now Tasty Noddle

With the same deco... and just a change of name, even the menu looks similar....

Everything is really reasonable priced here. Great if you are dining alone because they have a great choice for All day special for around $6 that includes a drink!

For my late lunch/afternoon tea (2:30 pm -5:30 pm), I ordered the Seaweed and Squid Ball with Rice Noodle with milk tea ($4.99). The balls are nice and have a great bite and the order is sizable! The milk tea though is meh..tasted like the tea had been sitting around for quite awhile and is not hot!

I would definitely come back for some late night noodle fix as Tasty Noodle House is opened till 1 am on Friday and Saturday."}
{"text":"Had the veggie Shanghai noodles. Good portions, tastes a little bland, ambiance is casual. Mostly pork and beef items on the menu, not surprising for a Chinese place."}
{"text":"Tasty Noodle house replaced two previous places it is more like a HK cafe style but dont underestimate their dinner (authentic chinese dinner meals) are just as good as any restaurant in the area. The food in general is good and worth giving them a try. Their cold drinks ie: Horlick and Olvaltine is made the way its supposed to definitely worth a try!"}
