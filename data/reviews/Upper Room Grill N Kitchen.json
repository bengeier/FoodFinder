{"text":"This is a basic greasy spoon breakfast place. No frills, kind of smells like old cigarettes but decent breakfast and not expensive."}
{"text":"Love Annie's Kitchen can't believe I just found this place. The Meat Lovers omelette is the best omelette I have ever had! Big chunks of steak, chicken, mushrooms, onions & green peppers plus cheddar cheese. French Toast & Pancakes are great too. Every thing is made right in front of you by Annie herself. The sides are small but I still give the place 5 Stars based on the Omelettes, French Toast & Pancakes. Staff in friendly too."}
{"text":"Decent, good portions, good food. Cooked by Annie herself. Service is fast and prices are decent."}
{"text":"Not impressed. Called ahead for my take out order. They were clearly understaffed, only one server and one cook. Place was packed so I knew my order would be awhile. I was waiting for a half an hour despite placing my order 20 minutes before I arrived. Finally received my order, the cook apologized and gave me an extra pancake (big deal) When I came home, I opened up my plastic box of supposed banana pancakes, no sign of any bananas in the pancakes! What a disappointment. I thought okay let me taste them before jumping to conclusions, damn, not even a hint of banana in each bite! I've learned my lesson, I will NEVER return!!"}
{"text":"Went there for brunch today. Yelp said open today. Got there to an empty parking lot with closed sign. So much for thinking yelp was accurate."}
{"text":"Great prices for good food!  I've only been for breakfasts but it's always good and they're always really friendly.

Not always the fastest service, so you can't be in a hurry and the parking lot is really small so I sometimes have to park a little ways away.

Overall great little restaurant."}
{"text":"I love mom and pop type places, and this greasy spoon exudes mom and pop.  But the problem is when you have a bunch of kids running the place, well it's like being at a place being run by a bunch of kids.

They were super friendly, but took them forever to take my order, or get me ketchup, or my coffee.  The kid could only handle doing absolutely only one thing at a time.  If she was waiting for an order from the kitchen, she'd stand and wait there until it came before moving on to doing item #2.

I don't blame her, but probably the lack of training.

Food was.. okay.  Considering the nearby options, if I was in the area, I'd do it again, but this time I'd be more assertive as a customer."}
{"text":"Overall 2.5 stars.

This is a typical local greasy spoon with all day breakfasts, burgers and sandwiches.  For what we ordered, the food was decent.  The portion was good.  The pricing was reasonable.  The services was friendly enough.  BUT The wait for the food was 40 minutes for a breakfast item and a sandwich.  

There were only 4 tables when we arrived.  If you come here and see only a table or two of customers, your experience would likely be better than ours."}
{"text":"I'm really happy that I decided to visit Annie's Kitchen. This is a small and cozy breakfast diner. There was only one cook and one waitress when we visited and I knew the service would be a bit slow but we were in no rush. We ordered our meals and it took about 15 minutes or so for it to arrive.

Salmon eggs benedict $11.50 - salmon tasted very fresh and came in a decent portion. The hollandaise sauce tasted great and so did the home fries. Very satsified with this meal.

Big breakfast for $9.95 was indeed a big breakfast. Comes with 3 eggs, sausage, peameal bacon, regular bacon, home fries, toast, pancakes and a side of fruit. We substituted the home fries with regular fries. When the food arrived they must have forgotten and just gave us home fries. However, towards the end of the meal they realized the mistake and gave us the regular fries at no extra cost. The fries were awesome because they were sprinkled with cajun seasoning. Bonus points for this of course. As for the food it was all excellent.

Like I said earlier the service was a bit slow. I don't think it is normally this slow because they ended up offering all customers who got slower service a free ice cream on a cone. Wow! I was extremely impressed by this type of service at a simple breakfast diner. More bonus points of course. Oh, and by the way, the ice cream was like a mountainous double scoop. 

The one waitress and one cook were working extremely hard to accomodate everyone and I think they did an excellent job. I felt a bigger tip than normal was required because of how they handled everything. 

A deserving 4.5 star breakfast diner."}
{"text":"Had to go to go to Stoufville Sunday morning so we decided to have breakfast at Annie's Kitchen. It is a small and cosy restaurant. My wife ordered the 3 egg breakfast, and I had the raisin bread french toast. The food was quite good. However, the service was quite slow and it did take a while to get our food."}
{"text":"Having breakfast at Annie's Kitchen is just eating at home.

If you looking for a wholesome home cook breakfast in Stouffville's Main Street area, there is no other better choice than Anne's.

The best part is Breakfast Special with a Free Coffee  ($5.95) is good till 11 am. So I can still sleep in and take advantage of the special. 

Ingredients here is fresh and coffee from Velvet Sunrise just down the street."}
{"text":"Friendly little place in Stouffville for breakfast and lunch. Breakfast is the usual eggs, bacon, sausages. Food is homey, nothing amazing to rave about.
This is the place for you if you are looking for a quick breakfast, brunch, or lunch."}
