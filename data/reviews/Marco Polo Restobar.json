{"text":"Love this place. Finally somewhere to hang out, relax and unwind.   Went for dessert/drinks and it did not disappoint. They have an enticing list of interesting cocktails and unique menu items.   I loved the s'mores dessert ... definitely a must-try! Picture your favourite campfire treat with a creative, urban twist."}
{"text":"I have been to this restaurant about six times, each time not so good as the last.    Last week five us us went for dinner - two entrees were great, three were not.  Thai coconut pasta was so salty it was not edible.  The steak frites comes with truffle oil and we asked for no truffle yet it still reeked and tasted of truffles.  We did let the server know about problems with the pasta at the beginning of the meal - she said she'd tell the kitchen.  When presented with the cheque, the server offered to talk to the manager about the problems with the meals, and came back with an offer to remove some of the side dishes from the bill.  The restaurant was so noisy we couldn't hear each other nor could we really have a conversation with staff.   I did send a note to the manager, but after a week no response.  Giving the restobar a permanent rest."}
{"text":"Maybe the best calamari  fried in town, tender and juicy inside, crispy on the outside, seeweed is a plus, their octopus is outstanding, the 8-hour braised short rib is the most sweet and tender, the grill produces the best steak, and the potatoes are truly finger licking. Pasta abd flatbreads are excellent too !"}
{"text":"First, don't look at the outside as it looks like an old retro building. Inside the environment is intimate and cozy. There is a fireplace with leather couches as a great hangout place.   The food is incredible. The grilled calamari is highly recommended. Slightly charred on one side but tender on the other. The drunken mussels with white wine and garlic was excellent. The flatbreads were also excellent."}
{"text":"Over priced. Nothing special food wise. Not sure what was supposed to be Mediterranean.The menu was a mish mash of dishes. Took a long time to find something we wanted to have and then the food was rather bland. Atmosphere was appealing. Decor was stylish. Service was very good but food took a long time coming and it was not a challenging order: calamari with a tasteless aioli and no lemon, okay but overpriced sandwiches ( on hamburger buns) salad without favour and not much dressing. They need to reevaluate the menu and add some favour and more enticing and reasonably priced choices if they hope to last! It would be a great addition to the neighbourhood but the cook needs help!"}
{"text":"I really enjoy the food here, except for the first visit, when it was just ok.  Came on a Thursday night and the ambiance during open night is totally different.  Very loud, bar type place rather than a sit in classy dinner.    They were short staffed this night and we weren't greeted  or seated and tables weren't cleaned in a timely manner.  Most people just grabbed an empty table.  I was expecting a classic restaurant vibe, but got a lively bar scene instead.   You have to follow their website/ig/fb to ensure you come on the night that matches the ambiance/environment you are looking for."}
{"text":"Firstly, service was good. The waitress was kind and friendly. She came back often to refill glasses and ask how our dishes were. I had to run back to the car twice and noticed that the front staff had a little pow wow session at the very front of the restaurant. Super awkward when they seem to be talking fervently together and stop talking when I walked by the door to get inside..   My family and I came because of their buck a shuck offerings. They have buck a shuck every day of the week! While we were hesitant at first, it turned out to be very fresh and tasty. They don't offer many toppings to add flavour but they have freshly ground horseradish and some kind of spicy-onion-y side that adds a nice kick.   My friend ordered the salmon pasta and it was quite tasty and had a bit of spice to it- not the flavourful type of spice but the kind of spice that lingers and is peppery. The fish was a flaky and also very tasty.   My mom ordered the calamari dish and the salmon tartar. Both were good for sharing and were flavourful once you got some of the \"sauce\" and seasoning onto it. The salmon tartar was a bit bland at first but you have to really mix it and get the avocado (more like guacamole) added to it.  They don't offer a kids menu or any kids portions, which was really a bummer. I didn't want to order a regular, adult-sized mac n cheese for a 1.5 year old. However, they did have high chairs!   I really craved a salad that day. However, their salad menu lacked any kind of creativity so I didn't end up ordering any. If I wanted to pay high-end restaurant prices for a salad, I at least would want it to be one that is worth paying for. Maybe a beet salad or carpaccio salad? Just throwing some ideas out there...   Overall a great experience!"}
{"text":"A delicious lunch on their patio on a beautiful summer afternoon. Food was absolutely delicious. Service was amazing. Cozy atmosphere throughout the establishment. Loved that they served us water and left a full bottle at the table sitting in a wine bucket of ice. Nice fabric napkins. Hidden little jewel on Lakeshore Rd in Mississauga."}
{"text":"Loved it. The salmon tartar and shrimp tacos are a must!  The service was excellent, and we enjoyed the live band."}
{"text":"The ambience of this place is amazing! The food is great, the service is great, the drinks are great! I am definitely a repeat customer!"}
{"text":"The lively atmosphere feels like an invitation for you to be free and let go of your inner childish mind and just have fun, and is a great place for a social night with friends. The food portion is rather smaller than I preferred and their french fries are dry, hard, and a bit too salty for my preference. But what they did right are where things count. The main characters on the dish were juicy, rich with flavours, succulent, and engages your appetite. It was a nice touch that there was a live band performance. Although lively, it could be too loud for conversation."}
{"text":"I was in the Mississauga area and was looking for some value deals for dinner. I found a deal on Groupon for this restaurant and decided to give it a try. After my experience, let's just say I will not be responding to Marco.  Food 2/5 ---------- The voucher allow us to order up to $40 worth of food. Since this was our first visit, we wanted to try different things on their menu. We ended up getting 1lb of wings (garlic parmesan), blackened chicken tacos, and the \"Burger Burger\" burger.   The wings supposed to come with celery and carrot slaw. There were barely any celery and the carrot slaw was just shredded carrots drenched with ranch sauce on top. We like our wings saucy and the waitress confirmed these would be saucy, but the sauce was almost non-existence. There were more grease on the plate than sauce. Yikes!  The blackened chicken tacos weren't too bad. We ordered an extra one because we were super hungry ($4 extra). It tasted pretty good except they didn't have guacamole in the tacos which supposed to come with the tacos. We told the waitress and she ended up getting us a side of guac! We love our guac so this made up for it.        The \"Burger Burger\" burger uses a chuck and brisket patty, but I didn't find anything special. It honestly tasted like a regular beef patty to me. The saving grace on this dish were the fries. The fries were well seasoned and were very flavourful, best tasting food we ordered.  Service 1/5 ---------- When we got in, we were greeted by a waitress. She looked a bit pissed off. Maybe that's how she is? We were seated, presented with the menu, and she gave us water, pretty standard stuff. Another waitress took our order, she seemed a bit more enthusiastic than the other lady. However, she took our order without writing it down. Guess she has a good memory? Well, she forgot my beer, so I guess not. Since it doesn't seem like they get a lot of customers (only 4 - 5 tables filled), I guess they only needed 2 waitresses? However, they weren't really around. One was chilling behind the bar, and the other would occasionally show up. We had to even wave them over to refill our water. When the bill came, it was a bit confusing to follow the structure. 1) We were only taxed on the additional cost rather than everything we ordered (no complaints there). 2) They charged us 100% of gratuity of the remaining balance which equates to 15%. I'm not too pleased about the fixed gratuity, it's only the 2 of us, why am I forced to pay 15%? Based on their service, I would have just gave them 10%.  Atmosphere 3/5 ---------- The place was fairly clean. It was pretty spacious and they even had a live band which brought some life to the restaurant. But I personally thought it was too loud as it was really hard to socialize. To be fair, we were seated next to the band. Decor was pretty simple, lights were dimmed, but it doesn't give you that romantic-feel.  Overall, my experience at Marco Polo was pretty disappointing. Food was greasy, missing condiments, and lack of service. I will not be coming back here again, even with a Groupon."}
{"text":"We went on Saturday and there was a live band that was not bad.   The service was good but quite slow which happens sometimes.  The food was not good. I had the motherclucker which was too greasy. The calamari appetizer was a bit soggy. The shrimp taco appetizer was good. The steak frites were flavorless. The meat tray was boring. There was no freshness on the plates. The mac and cheese was good.   If they could fix the menu/food it could be a nice little place."}
{"text":"Came here on a weeknight at around 9 and the place was completely empty. Kind of odd at first but was nice to not be in such a crowded place. The food was very high quality- we had the calamari, the mac and cheese, and the tacos. All three were excellent, although the slice of bread that came with the mac and cheese was very stale. Otherwise though everything was good. The quality of the food justified the price and I like that the menu had a few interesting dishes choose from (not all the same boring stuff you get at most restaurants). The manager was also super nice so that made our experience even better. Will be returning."}
{"text":"Too bad we cannot give 10+ stars.  We needed an after funeral lunch - quick- on 8/12/2016 and by chance happened to stop by - after exhaustive visits on Lakeshore. The restaurant was closed on this Monday but were given access to - and a kind reception - by the father of the owner.  Seamless arrangements and menu selections allowed us to pay attention to other matters. Kyle (the owner) closed the restaurant on this Friday afternoon and we had around 70 people celebrating my mother's life.  People we complementing me??? about the food and service... It was all Marco Polo.  We truly appreciate the family that runs this restaurant that hosted and provided a superior+++ reception."}
{"text":"We went on a Saturday night to check out the live band. There was a couple birthday parties going on so it was packed. The waitresses were really friendly and calm despite it being so crazy in there.  I enjoyed the live band but it was sooo loud. The place is pretty small so the volume doesn't need to be that high. It was actually a bit of a relief when they went and took a break. Other then that the food and drinks were good and I'd recommend this place on a week night."}
{"text":"The place is cold for a Sunday lunch which they should have turned on the heat earlier on. It didn't get warmer either. I warmed myself up with hot water and lemon.   The service was good. She was up front with all the details with us using a groupon.  But we waited for awhile for our food - with only 3 tables open.   My salmon-prawn sandwich was good. I wished it was hot. The side salad was fresh and nice to the taste. Not too salty or sour.   However, my partner's steak and frites dish was very big disappointment. The fries was crispy but not hot. The beef was well done instead of medium. I tasted it and it was dry. They gave him another beef, but the portion was smaller and not placed nicely like the first time the dish came. It looked awkward by itself. For $26, it was definitely not worth the price.   They have daily specials and entertainment on Fridays, but after this experience, I'm not sure I'll want to go back. It's not a cozy nice atmosphere to hang out."}
{"text":"Went here last night with my boss, coworker and husband. It was Cinco de Mayo. Cocktails were on special for $10 and Coronas for $5. We all ordered drinks, my boss ordered wine, I ordered the Wheelchair Jimmy my friend ordered the \"I need a vacation\", and my husband the Corona. I really liked the Wheelchair Jimmy it wasn't too strong. I enjoy fruitier drinks  I didn't really like my friend's cocktail too much.     There was live music when we went the band was excellent. The lady sang Latin music, a guy on keys and another guy playing percussion.   There was a lot of good choices on the menu.  My boss ordered clams and he loved them, he kept the sauce even though all the clams were gone and dipped his bread in it.   I got a dozen oysters as well as the salmon tartare. Some of the oysters were tiny but I guess I can't complain because it was \"a buck a shuck.\" I enjoyed mine with lemon and hot sauce and a tiny bit of horseradish provided. Came on a nice stone platter in a bed of salt.  The tartar was okay I think it needed just a little bit more salt and acidity, but it was a lot to eat. I would advise people to share that plate for sure. It's under the shareables part of the menu but I ordered it as my main and it was a lot.    My coworker ordered the piri piri shrimp tacos and I didn't taste them but she said they were good. My husband ordered the calamari  and it wasn't breaded but it was good. They asked if he wanted it grilled or fried -he got grilled.      For dessert we all ordered different things, the chocolate cake, churro doughnuts and the cheesecake. The chocolate cake was good not super rich, but just right. The cheesecake was okay, tasted good but didn't like the texture, my husband didn't like it.  I loved the churro doughnuts- they were very hot(be careful), crunchy on the outside and soft on the inside on top of Nutella mousse. It was excellent.     Would definitely come back again service was good. It was a bit loud but it is a restobar. The crowd is a bit older, around 40-60.   Our bill total came to $49 the waitress had given us the wrong bill. It actually came to $151. Pretty good considering all that we ordered. My boss was surprised it was cheap. I had a great time. Would come back again, definitely ordering the Nutella donuts again."}
{"text":"Discovered this place through groupon and had no issues making a reservation. I chose to go on a Saturday evening so we could catch some live music. It was a Jazz night and the band was cute. The singer seemed to know most of the crowd.  2 stars for the cod balls and chorizo corndogs. Way too salty. The buck a shuck oysters were a great deal and tasted great too. Only thing is I've never had oysters on a bed of salt. It was difficult to avoid getting some that was stuck to the bottom which also made it salty so 3 stars for that. The marco polo flatbread is something I would recommend.   Overall 4 stars simply because there aren't that many restaurants with live music around here so it's definitely a nice place to try."}
{"text":"Nice place! Attended an open mic here, the ambience and seating looks very posh. They had specials on Thursday, the poutine looked really good.   Definitely a spot to go to for dinner or  drinks when you are in the village!"}
