{"text":"Les meilleurs sushis pour emporter que j'ai trouvé à date. Les makis aux crevettes tempura étaient tout simplement délicieux!"}
{"text":"By far the best sushi in town!  It's simple and delicious traditionsl sushi.  More of a take out place.  It has only 6 small tables."}
{"text":"This was my first Montreal sushi experience-- being from Vancouver, I'm a harsh judge when it comes to sushi.  This place wasn't bad, it was like a cute little restaurant inside a convenience store. The choices were very very limited and were, in my honest opinion, all kind of the same thing. I had no idea that dynamite rolls were just a west coast thing; I asked and the waitress had no idea what I was talking about-- but they were more than willing to roll up a custom order which was nice. I also got to try my first ever sushi pizza. I had no idea that was a thing (Montreal/east coast thing?) but my goodness, it was yummy.  It was pretty pricey for the quality and lack of quantity; I think with my friend we spent about $65. But I can understand why seafood would be more expensive here. Finally, just a general thought about the Japanese places that I've researched about here. I'm very surprised that they only either offer just rolls/cones or just hot foods.. But not both. Maybe they offer both at the very expensive $300+ places? Maybe I'll have better luck in Verdun."}
{"text":"Wanted to go for brunch at their famous neighbor. Horrified by the crowd waiting outside. So stepped into their place randomly. Their cone sushi is super! Nigiri sushis and sashimi are also nice."}
{"text":"Lovely little sushi shop in Plateau, with really good prices. Their miso soup and salad are really good! The sushis are fresh and generous portions. They also sell asian snacks as in a depanneur."}
{"text":"I found the name interesting that's what drew my presence in . When you walk in you can see how busy the workers are preparing their orders . There are 6 tables to choose from to sit and eat. It was crowded. That's how you know the sushi is good. So  it was my first time there and I didn't know how the process worked so I just asked one of the employees and they were pretty direct in their assistance. You take a menu  highlight your choices then you follow at the cash register. I decided to eat there even though all the seats were taken so I sat where people made their command orders . I was hungry so it didn't bother me. I had the Saumon  sushi with spicy mayo and the miso soup. It was average. I would like to try different types of sushi on the menu though . So I will go there again."}
{"text":"Good sushi prepared quickly! I placed an order for three rolls for take-out and they estimated 10-15 minutes. I arrived and my sushi was waiting for me in the fridge. Each roll had nice big pieces of fish that tasted extremely fresh. I found there to be a bit too much rice, which made the meal very filling. I will definitely return!"}
{"text":"L'endroit est attirant, coloré, propre et offre plusieurs produits dont une grande sélection de Pocky !!! Commandé des \"Dragon eye\" et un cornet de saumon epicé et si on mange sur place, vous aurez droit à une soupe miso et un bol de salade. Belle présentation toutefois un peu déçue du Dragon eye car le gras de la friture a supplanté le goût du sushi. Le saumon épicé, très bon. Bref, a recommandé pour manger sur le pouce en vous baladant sur le plateau."}
{"text":"Je n'ai jamais été dans ce resto... toujours la livraison !!!! Et ça vaut vraiment le coup !  La façon de couper les sashimis est juste parfaite, ces grandes tranches fines, c'est un régal ! Me semble que le poisson est encore meilleur de cette façon là. Ca vaut aussi le coup pour les makis de printemps.  En tout cas, c'est vraiment un super resto de sushis à livrer ! Et d'ailleurs... c'est l'heure des les appeler !!! :p"}
{"text":"Le nom fait un peu peur au départ : suffit de penser au dép à côté de chez soi pour pas avoir envie d'y voir des sushis ! Mais bon, un dimanche midi, une folle envie de sushis, et aucune motivation pour sortir du canap' = Just-Eat et Sushi & Dépanneur.  Bah c'était une très bonne idée ! Je recommande tout particulièrement les sashimis, qui sont coupés fins, vraiment très bons ! Et j'ai également testé le Yuki, excellent !  Certain que Sushi & Dépanneur rentre maintenant dans mes places privilégiés pour me faire livrer !"}
{"text":"Have you had your foodgasm today? If not, get yourself over to this understated but superb sushi joint for ---get ready for this--- the BEST sushi in the city.  This place wins in every category: As soon as you enter and are seated (if dining in), you're served a complementary toasted rice tea, followed shortly after by a small and perfect bowl of miso soup and then a wee salad with a creamy sesame dressing. That's all before you even order.  To order, you simply highlight the items you want from the menu and hand it over to the masters, who whip it up for you on the spot. The sushi is PERFECTION. It's art. It's sex in your mouth.  We ordered one of the combo sushi plates and then added a couple of tempura extras. The tempura sushi was divine, exactly what I've been looking for all over the city and hadn't been able to find till I got here.  The staff are the friendliest people you'd ever hope to meet - our server was so exceptionally sweet from beginning to end. She told us to come in anytime, even just to chat. What a doll.  Now - the name of this place might be a little off-putting if you imagine a typical dirty, disorganized Montreal depanneur with cigarettes and dusty bottles of beer, but this place couldn't be further from that. It's clean, organized and not your typical depanneur - it's more like a specialty Asian food market, with items like matcha, nori, hot sauces, mochi, and other treats. Again, the word is CLEAN. It's open, airy and a pleasant section of the restaurant to explore while waiting for your food (but you don't have to wait that long).  Eating here was the kind of experience where you leave glowing, feeling better than when you arrived, full of blissful belly satisfaction and a nurturing experience.  Thankfully, I live close by so I'll be going back again, and again, and again.  Go see for yourself what I'm raving about. Ten stars."}
{"text":"We had dinner at the sushi and depanneur. It has an awesome atmosphere. I even found matcha powder in their convenience store.  Being anglophone here in Montreal can be difficult but even though they didn't have an English menu the waitress/cashier was very accommodating. She brought us tea and miso soup then a salad before our meal. I did mention that I am vegetarian and she was also very attentive to that. I'd say the food, on the other hand, was mediocre. It could be the soy sauce or making each part of the meal a little different than what we expected."}
{"text":"Just like the name hints this is a Sushi-Depanneur (grocery shop) hybride. You can get a decent shushi for 4-5$ but you can also find a lot of Asain (mostly Japanese and Chinese) delicatests from sauces to candy. I taught the vegetrian Sushi (which was wraped with rice paper and not seaa weed) was too big (I like my Sushi bite size) but the other types we tried were perfect little sushi snack. If you feel you need a sushi stop and you are in the area this is a good option"}
{"text":"fresh but slow service i was getting take out and i ordered 2 small things took forever. my ikura sushi wich tasted good but had a fishy smell, my spicy tuna cone was perfect very generous. since its a popular place im assuming the sushi must be fresh. will go back for sure."}
{"text":"Super clean and modern spot. You can pick up to go or eat on site. They give you a paper menu and a highlighter to pick out what you want, always helpful! Our order came with a salad and a miso soup. I got sushi wrapped in avocado, both delicious and picturesque. The sushi is rather large, so perhaps 2-3 orders per person max.  They also sell lots of fun Asian fair from exotic flavours of poke sticks to mochi ice cream."}
