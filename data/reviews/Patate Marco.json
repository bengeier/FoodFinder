{"text":"Had their chick pea soup & chased it down with a cheeseburger yesterday.
I was quite happy with both. Very tasty after a winter day of shovelling snow.
This restaurant is quite popular en route to cottage country."}
{"text":"Des vraies patates \"graisseuses\" comme dans le bon vieux temps. L'endroit est plein mais pas très propre. Un conseil: n'allez pas voir la salle de bain si vous voulez garder votre appétit."}
{"text":"We've been going to Patate Marco steadily for a year now, at least once a month. It's conveniently located on the main highway in Chertsey and with its red roof, located between a gas station and a Provigo, you can't miss it. There is plenty of indoor and outdoor seating and they provide you with a ringing/buzzing pager after you order so you can find your table while they get your food ready.

Marco has by far the best diner fries (dark, sweet and tender) I have had in a long time. Lafleure used to have fries like this in the 90's before their quality vanished. Everything we've ever tried at Marco has been excellent."}
{"text":"Patate Marco serves the standard roadside fare: fries, burgers, poutine, etc. Its great place to stop on the way to or from the cottage, especially for the post-party hangover breakfast -- in my experience, anyway...
I really like the burgers, and the poutine sauce is great.
They also have a large ice cream menu and serve delicious milk shakes. 

There is indoor seating as well as some picnic tables outdoors. Depending on when you go, you may end up waiting as it tends to get busy with people on their way to or from the cottage."}
{"text":"Excellent roadside eatery. Many kinds of poutine, good burgers, solid milk shakes. Amazing traditional desserts."}
