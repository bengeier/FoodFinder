{"text":"Menu has many options, so there is something for everyone. Food was good. Raspberry pancakes were awesome! Did not have to wait to be seated and service was good."}
{"text":"I've been here half a dozen times and have yet to dislike anything I've ordered. They have a fairly large selection and everyone is quite affordable considering the side items that come free with most meals. I usually get the pancakes as one of my sides and eat them for breakfast the next day."}
{"text":"The service here is terrible. My 2 kids and I have been waiting for breakfast for almost an hour after we ordered. No sign of food and wait staff in not communicative. I had to go up and ask for our food to go. Ridiculous and frustrating."}
{"text":"Wonderful food, large portion sizes, and reasonable prices. Their breakfast potatoes were so good (they had some sort of yummy seasoning on them). I'm not sure why there are negative reviews of this place. I thought the service was just fine - the staff was attentive and the food came out quickly. I'd definitely come back! Give them a try, folks."}
{"text":"I went here with my Grand-daughter for breakfast.  They have a kid's menu for breakfast with many nice choices.   She picked chocolate chip pancakes, which came with a whipped cream smiley face and warm syrup.  She loved this!  I had eggs with hash browns and bacon.  Everything was perfectly prepared and delicious.  Restaurant is bright and cheery with big full length windows on one wall."}
{"text":"It was overall just the most meh diner I've been to.  The selections were really good, but I got eggs benedict with house potatoes and holy moly, was it bland. The eggs were perfectly cooked and it looked delicious, but no flavor."}
{"text":"My problem with most breakfast places is that they give you too much low quality food. Or I leave some of the best breakfast places in town feeling a little hungry. Then there's this place which really hits my sweet spot for price / food taste / food quantity. The Lola's benedict with mixed greens and fruit salad was really good. I've also had the nutella french toast with bananas and that was also really good."}
{"text":"Not the best or the worst.  First of all there was more than a bit of a language barrier trying to order, and this inevitably led to order errors.  Moreover the dish I had wasnt great and seemed way over priced for what I recieved.    But I might give them another try as the French toast that the people next to us had looked prettt tasty, if a bit small for the listed price."}
{"text":"I am shooketh... I don't even know where to begin. Bringing the check to me on a broken iPad epitomizes the quality of this place. Don't go. Just don't."}
{"text":"I stopped in after dining next door at Mr. Brews for a coffee and something sweet. After all, the name of the place is Lola's CAFE and there's a coffee cup on the sign, so I expected some sort of coffee shop. Walking in I was surprised to find it to be a full service sit down restaurant. It was also completely empty at 1:15 PM, not a good sign. It should be noted that upon entering there was a strong odor of baked or burning oil/grease.  The waitress stopped sweeping and asked if she could seat me, but I said I'd just like a coffee to go and a dessert. She started getting my coffee and then said \"Breakfast or Lunch\". I explained again, \"No, just dessert\". Then she handed me a menu. There was a huge list of foods, but I still wasn't seeing any desserts. So I asked one more time \"Postres?\". She said, only french toast. So I left it there.  While she was getting me cream and sugar I took a look around and was glad I didn't order any food. I had located what I'm sure the source of the smell was. In back there's a large flat-top that looks like it hadn't been cleaned in a year or more. Food debris scattered all over it, and used cooking utensils laying around haphazardly. The cutting boards were well used and discolored, a sign that there would be no way to really sanitize them. There was a small dish of some sort of jelly sitting out behind the counter. Finally, the door to the back office was open and there were piles of papers, refuse, and supplies strewn about with cables and wires strung all over the place.  Tasted my coffee and it's some sort of Sysco Harvest Ridge dishwater. In a town where many of the bars are serving Ancora with a place that has a coffee cup on the sign, that's just not right.  I left with my \"coffee\" and will not be back any time soon."}
{"text":"Good breakfast and friendly service. I would come back. They were pretty busy on Sunday morning, so service was a little slow, especially when we wanted to pay. I really liked the South of the Border scramble. They did get a few things wrong in our order, though (didn't add mushrooms, gave me regular eggs instead of just whites, breakfast sandwich missing tomato and bacon). We liked what we ended up with, but it wasn't quite what we asked for."}
{"text":"I'm not sure why I'm even giving them one star.  The service was horrible.  The wait staff apparently can not speak English.  And my biggest complaint was the \"bottomless\" coffee was not bottomless.  I was charged $2.50 for each refill and was charged for a refill I never got. When I asked the waitress why I was charged three times for \"bottomless\" coffee she just stared at me and shrugged her shoulders.  And the food was not all that good."}
{"text":"The same owners of Taqueria Guadalajara and Francisco's Cantina just opened up this cafe, so we had to go check it out. Really huge menu, but not much of a hint of the traditional Mexican food of their other two places. A breakfast burrito and a fajita omelet. Chorizo and eggs seemed like the most authentic Mexican, so we gave that a try. It was quite yummy, especially when mixed with the house potatoes. The breakfast menu is quite extensive, and most dishes come with the choice of TWO sides - with many, many options to choose from. I'm always a sucker for eggs Benedict, and there is a whole section of the menu devoted to them. I ordered the veggie Benedict - eggs were perfectly poached, and the hollandaise was very tasty - and not drowning everything, just the right amount. The promise of \"fresh herbs\" talked me in to the veggie Benedict, but there were none to be seen, so that was disappointing. The option of mixed greens as a side is always appreciated - and that was the highlight of the dish! Light, tasty dressing. Loved it. So many other items to try (pancakes and French Toast options are creative and tempting), so we will definitely be back."}
{"text":"I'm not a big breakfast person, but the choices were great. Had the Bacon Avocado scramble and my wife had the ham and cheddar omelette. Friendly service. A little slow, but perfect for a Saturday morning."}
{"text":"I held off on rating this restaurant because I went during their first day (literally the first customer) and there were a myriad of issues. Ordering took forever, the lead time for getting your food was sub-par, and there weren't many people there but the service was just so slow.  Upon going back a few months later, I'd like to recognize that this restaurant is getting much better. Nearby, they are part of the same family that runs Gloria's (an excellent latin cuisine restaurant) and while they can't match my enthusiasm for tacos, they aren't a bad option for \"diner\" fare on this side of town.  The crabcakes benedict is easily one of their best options on this menu and if you aren't quite sure what they're aiming for as a menu it models what you see in diners on the outskirts of town.  The \"toast pancakes\" are also delicious and come as a side with almost every breakfast meal. There may be a language barrier in ordering food, but please give this place a chance. They have good ownership and have learned from the first few months of operations."}
{"text":"Excellent new breakfast spot!    Strawberry banana nutella french toast and chorizo breakfast burrito were both delicious!"}
{"text":"Came here for brunch. The food was alright, nothing that stands out. The service on the other hand was down right poor. How can you forget (twice) to bring the salsa for the breakfast burrito? And they weren't even that busy. Lots of other places to go instead"}
{"text":"Went here for breakfast this morning based on previous views of the menu. As other reviewers have mentioned it's a fairly extensive menu and most items come with one if not two sides! We weren't greeted when we entered as there isn't really a hostess station. Upon surveying the tables we decided to ask if we could sit at the counter. I would highly recommend this as you get a good view of the kitchen as well as the entire cafe.   Service is quite slow. There's only one iPad that the staff is using to place orders and complete payments. Adding another into the rotation would speed things up. The current process is a seaat yourself setup with table service. The place seems to be better suited to ordering at the counter and then finding a table to wait for your food.   Despite the slow service, the staff is trying very hard to provide a good experience to every patron. And the food coming out of the kitchen is fantastic. I had the Ultimate scramble with hashbrowns. Everything was cooked perfectly. It came out to me piping hot and was exactly as I ordered. My friend ordered the biscuits and gravy. There's enough food in that meal for 2 people! It was 2 whole biscuits plus 2 sausage patties.   I'm excited to come back and try more of the menu items. I also want to give them another chance at better service. It was a pretty busy Sunday morning when we stopped in."}
{"text":"Excellent breakfast with my son and daughter here. Everything on the menu is top-notch, and the breakfast menu is extensive. The prices are low considering how much food you get. My asparagus omelet was chock full of fresh asparagus and cheeses. I would definitely order it on my next visit. In addition, you are given a choice of two sides if you get an omelet or some of the other items. My favorites so far are the biscuits and toast pancakes. The biscuits are grilled, tasty, and are a unique offering compared to other breakfast options. The toast pancakes are so gigantic that they are essentially a meal on their own. I ended up taking half of my asparagus omelet and a toast pancake home. $26 was a steal on breakfast for three. I will definitely be returning to Lola's soon."}
{"text":"Extremely poor service and mediocre food. Stay away. There are many other options in the area."}
{"text":"Keeping it brief. The food was delicious with a great menu. Friendly and fast service and good prices -- $20 for me and the fiancée for 2 entrees and a side. Not a robust web presence so they seem to be doing it off the word of mouth. To that end, go -- Check it out and I'm sure they'll have at least a few things you'll enjoy."}
{"text":"Lola's Cafe was a new experience for us today. We decided to try the Lola eggs benedict and the nutella french toast. The food tasted  scumptous and the presentation was nice. I definitely reccommend venturing on in to try out any of the options they have available.  Oh, the coffee was also good!"}
{"text":"It was interesting reading the other reviews after we went here, because we had an excellent time and our service was pretty great.   What's great about this place? They serve large, tasty meals at a reasonable price. What would I change? I would make the menu smaller and simpler.   The space definitely has more of a coffee shop look to it, but it's full waiter service. The dining room was about half-full when we arrived. Most breakfast meals are at or under $10. There were a noticeable number of vegetarian options and I'm sure you could make one of them vegan, but I didn't see any specific focus on vegan options.  I ordered the kale frittata and my boyfriend ordered the breakfast burrito. The frittata came with 2 sides and burrito came with 1.   Overall, I didn't expect a Marigold-level cafe tucked into a strip mall near Middleton, but that's virtually what this place is. If you happen to be out and about on the West side and in need of a quick breakfast/lunch, this place is awesome."}
{"text":"Small locally owned and operated breakfast and lunch cafe. I wished I was thrilled with my experience. Alas, it was only average.  The space was way larger than expected and somewhat \"bare bones.\" But I'm not knocking bare bones, that's how all restaurants should start.  Do not eat here if you're in a hurry. The one server and one chef worked very hard, but it took a full 25 minutes to receive our two breakfasts.  Our food was good, not great. We wouldn't order whole wheat pancakes again. The pancakes were too dry....they fell off my fork on the way to my mouth more than once.  At least the bananas, pecans and whipped cream somewhat made up for the dry pancakes, and the warm maple syrup was delicious.  I would try this place again, if only to find my favorite dish there."}
{"text":"Was looking for a new breakfast spot and decided to try Lola's after seeing the article written about it on Madison.com.   The restaurant is located in the old Capriotti's location near Huhot.   Having never been there, I asked the waitress what types of meats they had and her response was, \"I don't know\". Not a good start. I asked her if they had sausage links and she said yes. I ordered the 2x2x2 with eggs over hard, sausage links, and pancakes.   I started reading Yelp reviews as we waited and got a bit worried by the reviews of very slow service. It turned out to be ok and not overly long.   When our food arrived I saw that the sausage were patties instead of links. Not that big of a deal to me. Then I saw the pancakes were whole wheat versus the normal buttermilk. I'm not a fan of whole wheat pancakes and wished they had noted that under the selection. The eggs looked fine until I cut into them and saw the yolk was not fully cooked.   Overall, the eggs were way too oily, the sausage patties were not fully cooked in the middle and really greasy, and the whole wheat pancakes were dry. I did not finish my dish as the amount of oil and grease started hurting my stomach.   We will not be going back."}
{"text":"The service was abysmal.  Went in to get an order to go and waited 40 minutes.  The place was not overly busy, but it's clear they have no systems in place.  One girl was taking 75% of the orders and running all of the food.  2 people essentially just stood around confused.  They rang in my order twice and it took them five minutes to make an iced coffee, which was served in a children's to go cup, and it bizarrely included whipped cream.  It also took 5 minutes to pay after all of my food and the iced coffee was given to me.  Nothing like knowing everything is going to be stone cold when I get it home."}
{"text":"Don't go here unless u have time to wait! The service is horrible with one poor server taking care of the entire restaurant of over 15 tables and one helper. I sat myself as there was no-one to greet me and waited about 10 min before I went up to ask for a menu. I ordered the eggs Benedict and orange juice.. simple enough...but not here took an hour for food to come out when restaurant is only about half full. There was absolutely zero paper towels or toilet paper in the women's bathroom. The breakfast...not worth the wait...hashbriwns just taste like oil and the hollandaise tasted more like gravy. I will NOT be coming here again unless they hire more staff and get it together...maybe instead of 2 full menu pages they should cut it down to a few single items and perfect those."}
{"text":"Loved this place! Large breakfast menu and very reasonable prices. My dining companion had the crab cake eggs benedict and I had the berry french toast. Both were very tasty. We talked that we need to go back to try some of the other yummy items on the menu. The people that own it and work there are very nice and welcoming."}
{"text":"Perfect for the West Side foodie who doesn't want to drive downtown to get gourmet level food!  I had the California Eggs Benedict with hash browns and fruit cup for the sides. The eggs were perfectly cooked and the avocado added to the delicious creamy texture of the hollandaise sauce. There was a nice mix of fruits, not just one or two. Hash browns are a true test for me when evaluating a restaurant and Lola's brought their A-game! They were perfectly browned, not greasy, and cooked just right (not mushy)."}
