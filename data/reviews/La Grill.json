{"text":"Very poor customer service. Rude staff and very inconsistent policies from one person to the next. Great dissapointment."}
{"text":"This is my favourite middle eastern restaurant in the GTA. My family has been coming here for the longest time and the quality of the food has never changed. My favourite dishes are filet mignon, chicken kabob and the fattoush"}
{"text":"This was my first time here and needless to say it will be my last. I ordered a variety of food from here for a group of 8 family members. We got our order after about 30 minutes. The beef shawarma was terrible! It was re-fried with onions, however, the meat they use must be of cheap quality because it was so tough (rubbery almost). The chicken shawarma was dry and didn't taste very good. The kafta was probably the only thing that was good."}
{"text":"I definetly found a hidden gem here. Hands down best mediterranean food ever. In fact I am salivating right now thinking of their filet mignon kebob. The food is priced extremely reasonable. The freshness and taste is unexplainable.  The meat is so tender and melts in your mouth. Their garlic sauce i forget what its called tackini? Anyhow has your mouth humming for hours but well worth it.  The only downside is they are not open on evenings during the week. They cater to the lunch crowd and on evenings are open in the evening.   I have gone back multiple times since my initial try. I also recommend their falafel and chicken shawarma. It really is different from other places I have gone too. I dont what they add to it to make it taste so good. You have to try for yourself and see what I am talking about."}
{"text":"Amazing food. Always consistent. Been a fan for years. Way underpriced. The steak is to die for. Definitely a staple for my family and I."}
{"text":"I recently had my bridal shower here after being a long time customer. And I couldn't have been happier with how the day went! I've been coming for years here and loooooove the food.  Trust me you will never want any other chicken kebab after you have had this one. Lol. Pretty much everything is made in house and made to order. It takes longer coming to the table but omg it's so worth it. Food done right. I come for lunch often with my coworkers and usually call to order ahead to save time. There pricing is good for lunch and the girls who work there on the regular and really upbeat. My family isn't middle eastern but I love this spot so when I came time for my bridal shower I inquired about events and pricing. And folks, the price was right. Lol. It was great in fact for what the menu and the quality.  The girls who worked there kindly let us come the night before to drop off our centerpieces, favours, game station goods  and sweets. Not only that, I was please to see that they had set up our centerpieces on the tables and arranged our favours and game table! Having been in bridal parties too many times to count, I  know that your average venue won't do these little extras for you. You have to either come in early or send a trusted friend to get it right. I was glad to see it all set up, it gave us extra time and took some stress off the day. The food was  a hit with my family and the service was great. I was really able to enjoy my day with miminal stress. I wouldn't hesitate to gave another function here."}
{"text":"Absolutely some of the worst \"Mediterranean\" food I've ever seen. Not only were the portions small, the prices high, but what they \"call\" dishes such as kebobs, humus or schwarma are not what you'd expect at a real Mediterranean restaurant. Besides the lack luster food, the service was terrible. There's a reason this place was empty at lunch time."}
{"text":"After being a long time customer for more than 10 years, I am very shocked with the bad treatment of the staff/owner of this restaurant. I came with my child who always orders wraps for sit in dinner. This time, the owner said that he only make wraps for takeouts not for sit in during dinner time. But then he said, if it's only for a child, he can allow the sit in dinner. I ordered 3 Kabob (chicken and kofta) wraps for my child with a hummus as side, and tabule salad. One of the new server welcomed me to sit at a table. After 10 minutes,  the server (girl who takes orders) came and started raising her voice at me saying that I did not listen to her boss, and that I can only take the order as takeout. She brought all my order in bags, and was very rude, pointing her hands at me like she is reprimanding a child who got into a huge trouble. They had 5 empty tables and she would not accommodate us. I thought this was unacceptable treatment for any customer, and even worse for long term customers. My son was very hungry, so I paid and took the order as takeout.  As I was walking out of the door, I heard the same girl (the one who takes the orders, I don't know her name, I know she is not Christina) saying to me you don't have to come back here again with a smirk. I have never experienced such a bad treatment from any restaurant before. Who would tell his loyal customer don't come back here again?"}
{"text":"My grandfather was born in Syria and most of the arabic food was eaten at home and cooked by him or my grandmother.  I never knew there were so many wonderful places in the GTA to eat mediterranean/middle east dishes! And in recent years more and more options and locations are opening up. I have been eating at La Grill since my girlfriends suggested we try it back in 2006! We had a girls night out and I've been hooked ever since!  The nice thing about La Grill is you can try so  many different dishes from their menu due to their platter and group options. We always have the Hummus (a must!)  & Baba Ghanoug. (its made with eggplants) I loved their calamari and their Kebe. (Though my gramp's Kebe will always be my fave- their version is very good).  Sanbousik was good. Tasted like the greek Tiropita.  (Feta cheese wrapped in a thin layer of dough then lightly fried until golden brown.) And the tabouleh was good. (It was a favorite with my friends). Lebneh is similar to Tzatziki- most middle eastern dishes use similar ingredients.  Over all great place to sit and enjoy good food with good people. Sharing dishes like these makes it opportune to eat slow, savor meals and hold great group conversations.  I highly recommend La Grill!  And before I forget: the decor is quite nice...makes it a great place to go out for a romantic meal."}
{"text":"What's not to love at this place? I've been going there for over 12 years now. I have never had a bad experience or had to send back my food. I've been there for lunch, dinner, private parties and we had our son's Baptism reception there. The owner & his daughter provide top notch service & food. The quality of their kebobs are outstanding - especially the fillet mignon kebob & chicken. Tender, juicy meat, cooked right, fresh and served in generous portions. They treated us so well on so many different occasions. They are always busy so call ahead to make sure there isn't a private even going on - even if there is and they have extra seating, they will seat you near the bar and take out is always available. Falafels, kebob, salads, appetizers, I've been there so many times I've tried them all. It is my go to place for Lebanese & mediterranean food, even if it is a 30 minute drive from my house. I just wish they had a bigger location and maybe even a second one closer to where i live :o)"}
{"text":"This place is so terrible. The people answering phone are so rude....One time I called to find out if their soup is fresh because at times soup is not fresh so I needed to know that but, the guy on the phone was rude. He is like \"why are you asking me??? Our soup is always fresh....never ever ask this question again!!!!!!!!!!!!!\" Even thought several times before that when i called in the girl was honest and she told me that the soup wasn't fresh on that day......DEAR MANAGEMENT get your priority straight if you all gonna lie about something make sure everyone is on the same page. BESIDES, rudeness not GONNA INCREASE YOUR SALES!"}
{"text":"Hands down the worst falafel that money can buy. I have now tried it twice. They are extremely dry and greasy at the same time and with no flavour. How is that even possible?  I feel that they must be frozen or pre-made, and then left to dry out and then deep fried.  I even made my coworkers try the falafel and its unanimous...they are universally hated. I can't even give those things away....   Also rude and slow service. Would not go back."}
{"text":"Excellent food well worth every penny!!! Me and my family eat this often and even when we try new items from the menu we are never disappointed with the taste and quality of the food! The Kefta is to die for, the filet mignon is superb and the salads are always dressed to perfection. A fantastic place to bring a date with great decor and ambiance and extremely helpful staff."}
{"text":"Been there twice for family events. It is a beautiful venue for small events, food is amazing and delicious, quantities they put on tables feeds double the number sitting on the table. There chicken is so tender, kebeh nieh (raw kebeh) is delicious."}
{"text":"By far, the best mediterranean restaurant in Vaughan. Being a regular here, this place never disappoints, always great service and food quality.  The place is often booked for private functions, so it's always recommended to make reservations ahead of time..  Their staff is friendly, professional and always welcoming, Especially Christine..who always go above and beyond to make every visit a memorable one!  Place is great for private parties, about 120-150 seating capacity, offering good packages including apps, mains and bar service.  Hours are a little tricky though, I think they even close for dinner for a couple of days a week..etc...  Recommended plates: bbq beef tenderloin, and chicken tawouk..their kibbi, kibbi nayyi, and calamari are great."}
{"text":"This is hands down one of my favourite restaurants ever! I don't normally leave reviews but the food here is honestly to die for. Their chicken is so tender and never dry, and their filet is very fresh and tender, as well. They make the hummus and baba ganoush fresh, it never tastes pre made or dry. Their sanbousiks and fries are sooooo good (my guilty pleasures lol) I'm so hooked. Downside is that they're not open for dinner on weekdays, only lunch time. The food sometimes takes longer but staff have explained it's because they never cook anything and reheat it like banquet halls, everything is always made fresh to order. The manager is also very friendly and takes customer service to another level. Must try!!"}
