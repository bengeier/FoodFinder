{"text":"The sushi I had was great! Tempura was also really good. The restaurant was packed with limited parking. I will definitely be going back!"}
{"text":"Great food!! Great costumer service!! But too busy all the time!! We have to wait longer to get seats!"}
{"text":"Best ramen ever! We didn't expect someone would deal with the foods so seriously. Ramen here is even better than I had in Japan. Thumb up for the chef!"}
{"text":"A bunch of my friends decided to go out for sushi - I was really excited to go as I'm a huge sushi fan, and for the fact that I heard Shibuya has really good quality food.

Being fairly accessible as its just off of 16th Avenue, the restaurant is also conveniently located right beside Bubblemania.  I thank my lucky stars for having a small car where the parking lot can get fairly squishy due to its congested nature.  So if you're driving, do not try and burn donuts in the parking lot or you'll likely take out 10 extra cars in the process.

The  restaurant is quaint but set up in a very elegant yet modern style.  The staff was exceptional where they are very attentive.  Because it was a group of 8 people meeting at the restaurant, some were extremely late in getting there.  However the staff had no issue where they refilled beverages, and let us mull over the menu without issuing any pressure for those at the table to order.

The food I ordered were yam tempera rolls, and unagi maki off of the sushi menu - and although it was tasty, I had better quality sushi elsewhere in the city.  Certain things like sashimi are a bit pricey on the menu, while other items in specialty rolls can be limiting to some.  Being my first visit though, I would definitely go to Shibuya again."}
{"text":"I really enjoy the sushi at Shibuya. Their spicy salmon rolls are excellent and full of flavor. I love their dynamite rolls as well. Service is generally quick and friendly.

Also, to all the people trying Natto-- stop, you're being trolled."}
{"text":"Went here for dinner with friends. All in all I think the sushi and the quality of fish is better than the average sushi place, but there are better ones in Calgary. The hot menu is also tasty, especially the takoyaki, but other items like the yakisoba didn't really stand out for me. 

My real complaint was not so much with the food or service, but the layout of the restaurant. We were seated in the booths area and the way the benches are connected, whenever someone got up/sat down on the table behind us our bench would jump noticeably."}
{"text":"The salmon sashimi I had was great. Texture was really good.

I wasn't a fan of their sushi rolls though. I found the rice and the rest of the roll was too mushy and not too fresh tasting. Also, the miso soup was lukewarm.

I would have liked to try their udon but I don't think I'll be back, especially if they keep playing rap music over dinner service."}
{"text":"Great place! Great service! Convenient Parking! And fantastic food... I thoroughly enjoy Japanese cuisine , me and my lady dine frequently and really did enjoy this place and will definitely be coming back more often! SHA-BOOYA!!! :)"}
{"text":"Shibuya Izakaya is close to where we live, so we thought we'd check it out.  We walked in and were greeted by our server and off in the distance was an older woman who greeted us with a bow, how lovely!  We then ordered 5 rolls of sushi, California, Dynamite, Ahi Tuna, Yam, and Unagi.  They came out within a reasonable amount of time, but the R&B/Top 40 type of music threw off the whole authenticity, not to mention the Tabasco on the table as well (can anyone tell me why that's a staple in a Japanese restaurant?).  The sushi was pretty good, I'm no sushi connoisseur but I feel like I've had better. 

But overall I'm not complaining, as we only paid $30 including tip for everything, which is undeniably reasonable. 

I would definitely recommend this to anyone looking for a cheap and freshly made sushi fix, but I'm personally going to stick where I've been most satisfied."}
{"text":"I've only ever had skip the dishes deliver me this, so I've only tried the rolls but they were really good. Not gigantic (how are you supposed to eat those things, seriously?! I'm a human not a velociraptor), not too small but juuuuust right! They didn't put on sesame seeds or use mayo per my request but managed to make it look pretty! The yam/avocado roll is my favorite for sure. Decent prices, good rolls, and if I was dining in, I'd try the sashimi :)"}
{"text":"Love this place. Shibuya offers a great diversity in flavours and textures that sushi should have. Dynamite roll, BBQ eel and Ebi hit the spot. Price is reasonable, especially for the quality of food. A friend and I ordered 5 rolls (30pieces) and 4 sashimi pieces and our bill was $37. Save yourself the trouble of trying to find parking and park in the adjacent field."}
{"text":"Love the sushi here! I'm from Vancouver and very picky with my sushi and this restaurant impresses me every time the food is fresh the presentation amazing and the service is great!"}
{"text":"I went less than a year ago for the very first time and I remember I didn't like it that much

Went this past saturday and the food and service was horrible!
The rolls are unique, but the combination wasn't good at all...
The beef tataki is alright.  There were no octopus in the Takoyaki...it was just creamy

The restaurant wasn't even busy and they messed up on our orders and forgot 2 of items we ordered

Overall, it was horrible, I don't think i'll be going back."}
{"text":"My fiance and I love this restaurant! We think their sushi rolls are better than the normal nigiri sushi, we ordered KIWI PARADISE and that was a very good surprise! It tastes very fresh and I loved it (I don't normally eat kiwi). Also must order CREAMY YAKI UDON (it's not on the menu), it's kinda like carbonara spaghetti, it's so creamy and the udon is very spongy! Must try those 2!"}
{"text":"Although this is my to go spot for sushi, i have been finding that their customer service has been slacking. Don't get me wrong.. i LOVE the food! i always get spicy salmon, beef tataki, gesso calamari... actually this list can go on!

BUT as of recently in hiring more staff members, the service has gotten... i don't know? not as welcoming? especially that man they hired.. not the young one but the older one.. he was fine and welcoming when he first started.. but now just death stares, giving attitude but i still come for the food.

AND with yesterday, my friend and I had ordered the geso calamari.. whats with taking it off the table when you see me holding it in my hand and leaving me with no sauce..I WAS NOT FINISHED. 

This is my FAVOURITE sushi place in calgary, i will continue going here for the food but just kind of disappointed with their service lately..."}
{"text":"the staff at shibuya are very friendly, outgoing, and social. they pay attention to their guests. the food at shibuya is nothing creative nor unique. its typical authentic japanese cuisine. the spicy salmon roll is highly recommended, but thats about it... the kiwi paradise roll at first tasted like fruit cake then it tasted like smoked salmon. it was the weirdest blend of flavors. the greatest pro of shibuya is their business hours. they open very late. i'd rather go to Globefish though"}
{"text":"I was a fan of Shibuya Izakaya because I love their beef tataki. But I do not feel like coming back there anymore because when we were about to pay our bills and give a tip, the employee who was helping us gave us an attitude and told us that \"All Japanese restaurants like them should receive 6% not 5%\". She never say thank you to us and gave us a frown face. Which I think is not acceptable. 
I will never ever going back there. Zero star is what you deserve."}
{"text":"Very good ood. Some very interesting specials and regular dishes. Very Good service. Decore is good if somewhat plain. 

We had the Beef Tataki, crackling role and both were excellent.  Special rolls were different and we will be back to try more of them.

Nice selection of sake."}
{"text":"Portion size for the price was not the greatest, and they do not offer extra noodles. Broth wasn't the best, tasted watered down and not authentic."}
{"text":"My sister and I love finding all the great sushi places in town, whether together or separately. And if it's the latter - we eventually end up there together at some point in time. Shibuya was my sister's find and I enjoyed it so much, I ate here twice in one week!

Being on a soup kick lately, we ordered the spicy chicken udon and the bento box (this is only available at lunch) with teriyaki chicken and the spicy salmon roll. Our food came out relatively quickly and the portions were quite big (good thing we held off ordering two soups!) The soup hit the spot - spicy and flavorful broth with generous chucks of chicken & veggies. The bento box came with the usual (miso soup, rice & salad) in addition to the two items we chose, and you could tell it was all fresh & made to order. Who's had the wonderful experience of biting into icy/frozen lettuce or crunchy and/or dry rice from places that pre-make their bentos? You won't get that here at Shibuya!

Right on 16th Ave, you won't miss seeing this place - so make your way over there already!

(Oh! They don't do debit/credit transactions under $15 - so remember to have some cash on hand)"}
{"text":"Great ramen, great appetizers and some of the best sashimi in town! Top notch! Shabuya!!"}
{"text":"two people dinning $87total.Beef tataki is the best, salmon sashimi is thick cut, taro sashimi is the belly meat of tuna fish,Lobster sushi..Oyster happy hour starts from 5pm Monday to Thursday 6 oysters in total."}
{"text":"The Shibuya Roll is my favourite dish here - unagi with cream cheese, and the whole roll is deep fried. This is probably not a traditional Japanese dish (in Japan it's hard to find rolls at all much less deep fried rolls) but very tasty and unique in Calgary."}
{"text":"Came here for a quick bite and the quick bite came to over $120..Yikes! I actualy like this place, The Tapas style gives you a lot of different options. I love their Black Cod. I can eat a lot of that dish. They had lotus chips that was a bit pricey for what you get. They also had a King Mushroom Tempura which was suppose to be truffle salted, which was not. I found it bland. My partner loved their Beef Tataki she likes the beef lean and no fat, which she got. The rest of the food was good and i enjoyed the atmosphere and service."}
{"text":"This is my favourite restaurant in Calgary. I've been going here for years and have never had a single bad experience. The food is consistently excellent (unagi melody, beef tatake, takoyaki), and the service is fast! The price is fairly competitive, and the quality of the sushi is much better than most places. I can't recommend Shibuya enough!"}
{"text":"Havent been here in a while and was pleasantly surprised to find that they stepped up with theor food offering big time.  The oysters were top notch, the dumplings were crunchy pan seared properly, and the rolls, wow.

Black cod was the highlight of my visit today as the taste lingered big time and was proper!  

The fresh red roll was a kim chi take on a roll and was quite delicious as well.  

Prepare to taste all the flavor that seems lost on sushi spots these days.  You can taste the fresh unlike assembly line (er boats rather) franchise spots popping up more and more.

The korean fusion of the menu is really a must try.

Do avoid the AC or wear a sweater or you may be shivering inbetween bites!  Probably why the sushi is so fresh haha."}
{"text":"Love this place. Food is so good. I pretty much love every entrees they have on the menu. Only complaint is the price. $100 for lunch for 2 people is a little too much don't you think. Other than the price, love love love their beef or salmon tataki, fresh oyster."}
{"text":"Oh.... how quickly this placed lost its star rating. Let's just say we started with 4, and then on the car ride home, lost one. Then as my friend and I barely made it into our condo, 3.. Thank god we have two bathrooms. After spending an hour with stomach cramps, lets make it a 2 star rating.

I flushed the other 3 stars. 

Maybe a little too much information, but I am Mr. Honesty. The place is adorable. I liked the look and feel. It was atypical presentation for some place on the side of 16th Ave as far as I'm concerned. The menu  is pretty extensive, and lots of pictures. I do well with pictures. I have never seen so many options for appetizers at Japanese restaurant. Sashimi salad? Yes Please. 
We shared the dinner for two just to get a feel for some of the rolls. The Tempura wasn't oily which was nice, but it was cold :( I was even going to let that slide.

But considering I feel sick even typing this.

I probably won't be going back. Dayummmmm."}
{"text":"Driving around in the fresh snowfall of Smarch (http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=Smarch), we decided to hit up Shibuya for late night sushi noms.

I ordered the usual things a vegan can order in a sushi establishment; avocado and kappa maki, yams, a \"fitness cone.\" Everything was delicious, and the portions were more than fair. I was already mentally tabulating a 5-star review...

WHEN THE NATTO HAPPENED. This is the kind of thing someone would probably enjoy with a nice tall glass of durian shake. Describing it requires a level of disgust I can only muster with expletives, so I leave you with this screen cap:

http://twitpic.com/4kvlaz"}
{"text":"This restaurant exceeded my expectations. I came here years ago and the restaurant needed a definite facelift. But it looks as though they did some renos. We ordered quite a bit of food: red tuna, wild salmon sashimi, negi toro roll, spicy salmon roll, cowboy roll, black cod, beef teriyaki, and miso soup. All items had good flavor and presentation. 
Would return!"}
{"text":"easily one of my favourite places in the city. it stands out as one of the few Japanese restaurants around here that serve more than your typical sushi and ramen. the first time I came here was for sushi, and in that regard it didn't disappoint. I ordered tuna sashimi and it was so fresh I could easily 'cut' through it with my chop sticks. it was good, as were the rolls we ordered. some of my favourites on the menu are the salmon tataki, korokke, tonkatsu ramen, and both the grilled saba and tonkatsu dinners. and of course I can't forget the iced green tea, which is a typical iced black tea with matcha in it (sounds strange but it's really great).
I would recommend this place to just about anyone, especially those who are looking to try Japanese food beyond sushi and ramen."}
{"text":"Good service and excellent food, their teriyaki is the best delicious compared with other restaurant."}
{"text":"So in love with this place. I went everywhere trying to find some good ramen and finally found it here, each bowl is amazing! I've tried every flavour and recommend them all. They have some really unique dishes here that a lot of other Japanese restaurants don't have, and their prices are great too. They have a good deal for oysters on certain times and days if that's what you like. 
The servers are all incredibly friendly and always serve with a smile, I've never gone here and been disappointed!"}
{"text":"Oh my gosh, this food was SO good. Well worth the visit..lots of unique rolls (the Kiwi-Salmon Paradise roll is something to go back for!) and lots of unusual hot dishes (the Black Cod is a must-try) . My 7 year old had her Dad buy one of the coupon books from school (SUTP?) and she was just thrilled so was leafing through it begging us to take her somewhere in her new book. We saw this sushi place then I read a review or two here and thought it sounded good. We eat sushi a lot and most places have the same-old, same-old, which is good, but doesn't capture the art of sushi as I think it's intended. Well this place does and then some. We ordered the \"Black Cod\", the sushi platter, a salad roll with unusual ingredients (I forget the name), a roll with salmon and kiwi on it, a sizzling mackerel and then got some add ons. Well the starter, a plain miso soup, included with the sushi platter was delicious, but not warm enough. Our daughter loves miso but her Dad is not a fan, however this was so good that even he was commenting that it was good. They had a salad with that plate that had a delicious gingery-nutty dressing that was fantastic, although the salad must have just come out of the refrigerator as it was a bit too cold. Then came the rolls! There were so many interesting and different ones to choose from I didn't know what to try but the waitress suggested a salmon-kiwi roll and that is definitely worth returning for. So unusual and good and we had a vegetarian salad roll with it. The salad roll was again too cold but also a bit bland, but the roll with kiwi so delicious it made up for it and the presentation was unique and quite beautiful. We then had the flamed mackeral, which a roll the flame in front of you and the waitress said it had something like a ginger leaf in it? I don't know what it was, but it was a really nice flavour. We then got the \"Black Cod\", again, another must try. So succulent and tasty. Our daughter ordered an inside-out California roll. The shame was not trying so many good things, such as the tataki, ramen, steamed oysters or mussels in sake sauce, the octopus balls, the cowboy rolls which use tempura covered beef and so many other dishes my description here doesn't do justice for. The waitress was very nice and the chefs very kind to my 7 year old when she went over to watch them making rolls and putting out food. The must re-do for us is the salad that came with the meal, the salmon-kiwi roll and that Black Cod. Definitely worth a try and worth being adventurous. It goes beyond the usual sushi found around town!"}
{"text":"I love the spring mixed salad - love the salad dressing.  The portion used to be a lot bigger.  I'm disappointed that it's gotten smaller but same price.  Beef tataki was awesome.  I would prefer salmon talaki to be all raw instead of a bit sheared.  Sushi and sashimi pieces were a bit small and pricey."}
{"text":"Shibuya Izakaya is good little sushi restaurant in NW Calgary.  It has reasonably modern decoration, large comfy booths and a generally friendly atmosphere. The parking lot outside is a little crowded and it's easier to park out on the street.

We had the edemame, salmon and red tuna sashimi, sashimi salad rolls, and avocado maki.  Service was fast and efficient.  All in all  quite good.  I noticed Ramen is on the menu (not the case with most sushi places, which typically only serve Udon), didn't get to try it though.  

Shibuya is a solid sushi choice."}
{"text":"If the company is good and adventure is encouraged, then order anything with Natto to try. I've only managed to chomp down the Natto Maki but someday I'll tackle the beast in it's purest form. What is eating Natto like? Imagine if your mouth was Peter Venkman and Slimer flew into your mouth and wouldn't go away. Honestly, it's all a matter of finding away to chew the thing and bracing yourself for the taste. After a few bites, it's NATTO bad after all! *SNORT*

The first time I heard about Shibuya was when they served Japanese hot-dogs @ the taste of Calgary festival. It was an awesome hot dog, served with nori/katsobushi and okonomiyaki sauce. What was odd was that they named it \"Jap-a-dog\", which led to some the lazy and culturally benign-minded locals (mainly 15-20 drunk douchebags) refering to it as \"Japdog\"             *shakes head*

Since then Shibuya has always been a great late-dinner spot. The service is friendly but I am thankful that it's not as \"friendly\" as the business next door. My only criticism is that for an izakaya, beer and sake are expensive as SH#$!! Once in a while I order the sweet potato Sh?ch just to jog the palate. Aside from this Shibuya's sushi menu is ok compared to other sushi joints, with a few rolls that have impressed some of my previous companions, but where Shibuya shines is their non-sushi and grill menu. They have a formidable ramen and noodle menu. I love their grilled items and always found a satisfying meal experience by ordering various grilled items and eating it with a bowl of rice."}
{"text":"Shibuya reminds me of a lot of places in Richmond, BC. The food is tasty - no complaints. Service was great - we never felt rushed and all the staff was extremely polite. I really enjoyed the ebi mayo prawns came with tobiko and salad. Perfect bit of pop and crunch with shrimp. Octopus balls were also well-done - nicely cooked and good amount octopus in each bite. Cod was delicious with mayo - subtle and sweet. Chicken karrage was a bit different - the batter was very light and crumbly. The chicken was tender but not the greatest quality of meat- not bad but I wouldn't order it again. Yakiudon was a big portion, the sauce was a bit sweet. I prefer noodles that are a bit plumper, but it was good. With two big Asahi beers and tip, the total came up to just under $80."}
{"text":"Pretty decent sushi plus they have a huge menu selection which always makes me suspicious as that typically means that it usually is average overall.  Ie they wouldn't be able to do anything really well due to spreading themselves thin.
Better than average and is quite quick service.  Prices were reasonable also.
Younger crowd and parking is limited due to bubble place next door.  Noisy also when full inside with a very basic atmosphere. Also as I understand it, this place is not Japanese run which sometimes makes a difference for sushi quality and presentation."}
{"text":"Best sushi in town hands down!! The staff is friendly and attentive. Came here on a Sunday for family dinner and it was busy. Our food came out quick and everything was so delicious. Must try are the creamy udon, beef tataki, fresh oysters and the ebi chilly mayo. Sushi fresh and portion size are big. Wish they were closer to my house but definitely will be coming back."}
{"text":"Very fresh fish, beautiful dishes, and pretty great service! My favourite was the spicy ahi tuna roll. Super affordable at only $6 and has the flavour quality of a roll double that price. The spicy mayo is"}
{"text":"This has to be the worst sushi place we have ever tried and we have sushi on a regular basis. There was no flavour in any of the rolls, miso or sashimi. The fish was not fresh at all and was of very poor quality and cuts. The spicy sauce was really gross as well and definitely not spicy. Way overpriced especially for what you get in quality and portions. Very disappointing, considering we threw out the food incase of food poisoning, we will not be back."}
{"text":"Awesome sushi and sashimi. Everything I have had here is very fresh with bright colors, good texture, and perfect flavor. Tempura was mediocre. What I really enjoy here is the ramen! I am a fan of classic tonkatsu and these guys deliver the goods. The broth is perfect in color and consistency with the strong pork flavor you expect from tonkatsu and nothing to distract from it. The pork is probably the best I've had in the city with a good amount of pork that is cooked to perfection so it melts in your mouth. Other toppings are pretty standard. The noodles, however, are not quite as springy/squeaky/chewy as they should be, though they are still better than many places in the city. Service is always great and the extended hours are huge for me when I have late night cravings. Don't forget to stop next door to get a smoothie for dessert!"}
{"text":"We come here at least twice a month for lunch and or supper.  The sushi is always fresh, and service is great.  I've had the house special roll, tuna tataki, bento boxes with salmon Kama, Unagi roll, spider roll, miso black cod, and a whole bunch of other things.  I've never been disappointed.  The take constructive criticism well, apologize, and make it right unlike some other places I know.  For this I come back to this place as well.  Mind you there's only been a few times I had issues, but they fixed it.  My kids love the beef teriyaki udon here.  I've been here so many times but never remember to take pics or write a review, probably cause I'm busy stuffing my face with sushi."}
{"text":"Quick summary: Shibuya Izakaya transcends the average, forgettable sushi restaurants that plague every major city. With a menu of handful of creative rolls and appetizers, it will definitely please both the sushi fans and the first-timers. The only complaint I have are the overwhelming number of dishes listed on the menu, plus the dim setting that made the restaurant look more dingy hostile than hygienic and welcoming. 

Full Review 

Fellow Yelpers, you had me scared for my dear stomach (and my pants). Despite my friend's recommendation for this place, I was worried after reading reviews from here that implied higher-than-average possibility for food poisoning. I felt like I picked this restaurant out of many others that my friend offered too soon, and wondered even as I was driving to the restaurant if it was too late to change plans. On the other hand, I really did not want to disrespect the credibility of my friend's opinion. In the end, I decided to honour my friend's recommendation and give this place a try. 

When I walked in through the entrance, my fear doubled such that I took a few seconds locating the washroom before sitting down. Bless my metabolism, my stomach responds very fast to food of poor quality. The dining area was dimly lit, making the dark walls feel ominous, if not simply dirty. The mostly red decor did a poor job compensating for the lack of lighting - and this was during a bright, lunch hour! It did not help that the server dropped two encyclopedia-worthy books on our table that turned out to be menus - to go through it entirely would have been rude to my companion, who had been there a couple of times already. After flipping through hastily to imply that I've sort of tried to pick on my own, I turned towards my friend and asked her to order anything good based on her past experiences at the restaurant. 

She picked tayoyaki and tuna tataki for appetizer plus unagi and Red Forest rolls (with kimchi) as the main course. The server took the liberty of bringing the appetizers and the rolls at the same time without asking us beforehand - but service is not always the best strength of most Asian restaurants. Fortunately, most Japanese food can be eaten cold without ruining the experience too much. That being the case for everything we ordered, all the dishes tasted amazing. 

Tayoyaki was one of the best I had in Canada; it was packed with drool-worthy flavours, and the crunchy exterior surrounding the creamy interior made it even more enjoyable to eat. Tuna tataki was perfect; tuna - I was relieved to find out, as you can imagine -  was very fresh, and it was seared just enough to bring the best of both worlds of cooked and raw flavours of tuna together. The sauce and other accompaniment (e.g. sliced onions, katsuobushi) complemented the tuna well without overwhelming it - they were all necessary additions to the fish to make the dish an exceptional experience as a whole. 

Rolls did not disappoint either - in fact, they were quite tasty! The unagi roll, wrapped with avocado and topped with fish eggs, was a pure joy to eat. The smoothness of avocado, added with the firmer texture of unagi plus the bubbly fish eggs made the roll an absolute delight. Oh, but what about that one particular roll with kimchi as one of its main ingredients that was ordered? What do I, a Korean person very well accustomed to Korean cuisine, have to say about the Red Fores roll? 

Amazeballs. Seriously, I wish I could come up with a more respectable vocabulary to describe it, and I did try, but amazeball literally is the best word I can think of to describe it. The last time I enjoyed the fusion of Korean cuisine to that of another country was nearly two years ago when I found myself at a small, but fashionable restaurant in downtown Calgary, then-and-currently known as Anju. So my compliment to Shibuya Izakaya for creating a fusion roll that simply melted on my tongue should not be overlooked. What blew me away the most was how authentic the kimchi was. Not only was it most likely made by someone who is as well-experienced at making kimchi as any competent Korean housewives, it was also fermented just enough to bring the solid, unfiltered flavour of one of the highlights of Korean cuisine. The boldness of using the fermented kimchi rather than a freshly made one alone deserves to be applauded. Well done, chefs at Shibuya Izakaya! 

Other than the food, everything else was pretty standard. The dining area was quiet enough such that my friend and I could carry on a conversation without raising our voices. The seats were comfy, the tables were clean, and the server was attentive enough to ask us how the food tasted; with that said, I still am regretful about his bringing of main course and appetizers simultaneously. The price was reasonable, considering the quantity and the quality of the food. 

Oh, and nothing even remotely close to stomachache came after leaving this restaurant. 

Four stars."}
{"text":"I have been coming to this sushi restaurant for over 3 years and the food was always well prepared and good quality.  Also, the service was fast and friendly especially during lunch time.  However, in the past two visits the food and especially the service has been very disappointing.  The food is no longer fresh and tasteless, but most importantly the staff are very rude and grumpy.  Me and my coworkers were very offended by the service staff as we we waited a long time to get our food and then we didn't even receive the food we ordered, we will not come to this restaurant any longer.  There must have been a change in management as this is not the same food and service experience.  Don't waste your time coming here, it's better to just go to Sushi Bistro Anzu or Sushi Bar Zipang.  They are both nearby while being Japanese owned and managed."}
{"text":"Nothing but the best from Shibuya! Great staff (who always remember your name!) and amazing food. Always a great place to dine or order out from, and the accuracy of special orders is always on point!"}
{"text":"The restaurant I had planned to go to for my birthday would not make a reservation. So I decided to try somewhere I had never been for sushi. Yelp showed good reviews for here and they took my reservation. 

The restaurant is small but has a beautiful and warm ambiance. Our server was very attentive and helpful. We all had tea with our other drinks to keep warm and they always kept our cups full and warm but without hovering or annoying anyone. 

The sashimi was very fresh and tasty. I ordered a few of my absolute favorites like BBQ'd squid which was cooked to perfection and the sauce was flavorful. My oysters were not that fresh and covered in sauce in an failed attempt to cover this. The beef tetaki was cut too thin but the sauce was nice. I tried sea urchin for the second time ever. My first try over a decade ago was disgusting, mushy and just off so I never tried it again. While the sea urchin wasn't my favorite thing it was clear that fresh makes a world of difference. I liked the flavor and texture this time around. 

We all ordered deserts and I had the coconut mango surprise which is one of my favorites. They don't just take it out of the plastic and put it on a plate like most places. They added some whip cream and chocolate sauce on the hazelnut pear that the others had. 

In general the food was fresh with a few small disappointments. The service was excellent, fast, attentive and friendly. The prices were moderate to high. I would definitely go back to this place again."}
{"text":"YES YES YES. This restaurant was absolutely amazing! Driving up to it, it's definitely a hole in the wall but the food, the service, and the atmosphere was perfect. We always had a staff member near us, helping us get anything we needed. My water never went empty. The food took awhile to get out but we ordered a lot of food & it all ended up coming out at the same time.
We are vegetarians so the menu had a lot of selections! We had the corn, avocado, and asparagus nigiri. We also got the yam roll (AMAZING) & an avocado roll.
Definitely 10/10 recommend this spot if you're ever in Calgary. The staff was all friendly, the food was great, and the atmosphere was comfortable."}
{"text":"I've passed by Shibuya Izakaya several times and heard good things from friends so we decided to check it out for a late Sunday lunch/early dinner before we headed back home. It's located right beside Bubblemania Cafe.

The inside is pretty spacious with a couple TV's streaming baseball. We were seated in the booth areas to the side. Service is friendly and they checked up on us several times during our meal.

The regular menu is massive and is one of those menus with pictures of everything. Bento box lunch specials sound promising (only available 11:00am - 3:00pm). This is what you should be focusing on. Nigiri here is fresh and done well.

- Wasabi and ginger
- Seaweed salad ($4.50)
- Agedashi tofu ($5.75)
- Salmon isobe age ($8.50)
- Baby octopus ($8.75)
- Tonkotsu ramen ($12.50)
- Negi hamachi maki and unagi maki ($4.50 each)
- Tonkatsu pork cutlet udon ($13.50)
- Sake sockeye ($2.75 each)
- Hotategai nigiri ($2.25 each)
- Toro nigiri ($3.25 each)

Overall, we were pretty satisfied with our meal. Expect to pay a little more than normal as it's an izakaya but lots of variety to choose from. Stick with the nigiri and fried foods."}
{"text":"The oysters are good and I like the beef tataki. The rolls are okay. I tend to come here because it's not too far and have come to know the owners from when this place was called Ice Bar. I like supporting friends.

The only downside is the occasional runs either me or some of my friends get from eating here. LOL!! I had geoduck one time and had to do double time to get home and get on the sh*tter!! Same with a few other friends whenever they eat here. That's not a good sign...especially since they deal with raw fish!!"}
{"text":"We decided we needed a midnight snack the other night after bowling and because Cheesecake etc was closed we opted for Bubblemania.  It was 12 midnight and this place was packed, so one of my friends suggested this restaurant a couple of doors down that she had heard about and she heard it was really good.

It was set up so elegant in there that we wondered if our bowling clothes would be appropriate. This is a cool sushi restaurant that seems to attract the very well dressed, hip and young Japanese clients which is completely a great sign.

The service was fantastic, our server was extremely patient; we didn't know quite what to order and she had to come back several times, we ordered several sushi combinations one being \"The Cowboy\" which had sliced beef which was so unique.  I had a chicken skewer, which were 3 skewers at below 6 dollars and the refreshing green tea ice cream.  My friend had a combination sushi which included a Miso soup and a salad which according to her had too much ginger and her boyfriend had the Ramón noodles and some tempura prawns.  

I was impressed with the low pricing of the dishes but I was more impressed with the presentation and the sizing (check out my photos). 

I would definitely come back here for a business meeting or a romantic evening with my honey. I am seriously glad that Bubblemania was full that night."}
{"text":"Shibuya has always been one of my top picks for sushi.  The food is always consistent and I like that the service is quick.  We've never had them miss an order or just take really long to prepare something. They are usually very busy at dinnertime. 

We wanted a quick lunch so we went here. We ordered the sweet sushi delight, plain udon and red forest roll (asked for customization to make the roll vegetarian - they will swap out the salmon for shitake if you pay an extra $1).  

The soup and salad arrived first which comes with the sweet sushi delight. The miso soup and salad was refreshing. The plain udon was very tasty, the broth was perfectly seasoned and the noodles were just right.  The sweet sushi delight was very hearty and we like that they have a vegetarian option on the menu as a combo since most sushi restaurants do not. 

The stand out of the meal is the red forest roll. The kimchi and the sauce just give the roll lots of flavour. I highly recommend this roll."}
{"text":"The sushi here is so fresh and beautiful.   The quality to price ration is awesome!  We had attentive service, and will definitely return"}
{"text":"I have never had sushi here, only their noodles - both udon and soba. Their soba noodles are amazing and I definitely recommend getting soba over udon. I preferred my warm bean curd noodles to the cold soba noodles my friend ordered but their were both really good. I didn't eat a lot of what was ordered but my friends all say that the tonkatsu ramen is especially amazing and that the fried soft shell crab was also very good. However, the squid sushi was not very good and hard to chew. They do have a vegetarian sushi meal and also a \"sweet\" sushi meal (included tamago, inari, etc.) which I believe was also entirely vegetarian. They also have a $1/oyster deal if you have spent a certain amount of money for your whole group on a per person basis (versus the normal $2/oyster). From what I saw the oysters were impressively large, especially considering that they were only $1 a piece, unlike other places where they are not even as large as the loonie you paid for them. We also had deep fried green tea ice cream, which was only ok so if you want dessert I would just head next door to Bubblemania instead!"}
{"text":"I have dined at shibuya about 5 times now and I must say it is a quality restaurant. Good service, really good food and a unique japanese menu with a few twist. I have not tried everything yet but I hope to complete the menu sometime near the end of 2011 hahaha, probably not but I will try.

So the menu has quite a bit of variety. First let me start with my favorite item of all, TAKOYAKI! It is the best I have had in the city, HECK it even beats the ones I got in japan on the street (when I visited in 2000) just really good and very well presented! The miso black cod is also a MUST. This take on the hit dish (originally created at the restaurant Nobu by chef Nobu )  is amazing!!! succulent, rich, sweet, salty and melt in your mouth good, I recommend getting some steamed rice and seaweed salad to help balance the richness of the cod while you eat it. Among that there are some other very interesting fusion sushi rolls and cones and a few other stand out items!

Now I would give this place a five star review BUT their is a reason I could not. Shibuya has all the makings of a 5 star destination however, I think because the menu is a little stretched some items on it sort of fall by the wayside. For example, simple items like the scewered chicken livers or the grilled chicken skin are either well prepared or poorly prepared (sort of the luck of the draw i guess!) the last time I got the chicken livers they were way overcooked, like rubber bullets! I had to force myself to eat them!! normally I would complain but I love this place so I just smiled and chewed, and chewed and chewed...etc  One other item I really did not like was the \"shibuya roll\" It had cream cheese in it!, and it just overwhelmed everything else in the roll all you good taste is phill cream cheese!, They really need a new signature roll!   Either way I was exited to hear the waitress say they are working on a new menu (it seems they are gonna tighten things up to keep the quality up on all the food! smart move!) So I look forward to going again very soon!

Overall I would recommend and even push anyone to go to this place, very nice atmosphere, great service and a totally tasty (and rather unique) menu. Two things you should know before coming here,#1 be prepared for a little line up wait AND #2 dont get the Nato roll! hahahaha (not because they make it poorly) but because Nato is only for people who know what Nato is. DONT ASK!"}
{"text":"Tucked away at the end of a strip mall that features bubble tea and an exotic massage parlor, Shibuya serves up Calgary's finest Japanese dining. I have been here about five times, and each time the meal is delicious. Their sushi is very fresh, the octopus croquet balls are to die for (the difference I have noticed has to do with the bonito flakes on top: they add another dimension to the meal), and the ramen is rich and tasty. Their special rolls are also great, in particular the Kiwi Paradise; the sweet kiwi contrasts perfectly with the fish, and made for a satisfying quasi-dessert at the end of the meal.

Unless you have a very refined palette, I would recommend you stay away from the nato rolls; we very nearly made the mistake of ordering a hand roll, which would certainly have resulted in instant death. The taste it left in our mouths nearly obliterated the entire preceding meal. 

The restaurant is fairly accessible, and though the parking can get tricky, there is a huge lot beside the building by Bubblemania with plenty of space. I am looking forward to my next visit."}
{"text":"Becoming a new mom, I pay very close attention to family friendly restaurants which includes having baby change table in restroom as well as high chairs and booster seats.

This restaurant does have high chairs and booster seats available and is a good restaurant for children.  

Unfortunately there are no change tables available in either female or male washrooms which is disappointing."}
{"text":"Service was pretty awesome here... They all tag teamed to make sure your drinks were topped off, you weren't low on tea and that the food was good.
Food was well presented, fresh and tasty.
Accidentally made some rolls with sesame when we mentioned we can't have due to an allergy- they were super apologetic and got fresh rolls to us fast.
Sorta in middle of nowhere a hop skip from peters drive in, not much parking, but it's nice inside, and ended up being packed at 6pm.
Definitely a place to return to."}
{"text":"We had a party of 6 and ordered a bunch of food for the table as well as ramen.  We ordered mostly rolls and fish appetizers.  The fish appetizers, particularly the miso cod is excellent.  Ramen were great as well.  The rolls were also very well constructed and had the perfect balance of ingredients.  The kimchi roll is bursting with flavor, and all the standards are excellent, especially the spider roll and house roll.  They are large!  Service is great!"}
{"text":"Been here too many times to count! Hot food and sushi/sashimi are both fresh and delicious! Service is always awesome. Love love love. :)"}
{"text":"Food 5/5 food is phenomenal . I love the beef Tataki ,Ebi chilli mayo and creamy udon. 

Service 5/5 the service is great you are greeted at the door and when you leave 

Environment 5/5 very clean and open 

Parking 5/5 there is a parking lot and street parking"}
{"text":"The black cod is fantastic.  All round great sushi and you should try the ramen too.  Great decor, good ambiance, and attentive staff.

A nice alternative to old school sushi."}
