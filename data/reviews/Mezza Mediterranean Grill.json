{"text":"My favourite chicken shawarma in Calgary! I love their creamy garlicky sauce and the perfectly flavoured tender chicken pieces. 

The portions are HUGE. And I like the fact that they are pretty clean. They wear gloves when handling the food and also the check the meat temperature with a thermometer before shaving it off and serving it to customers. At least there is some form of food standard that they adhere to which I rarely witness elsewhere.

But the bottom like is that I love the flavour of their garlicky sauce and the tasting chicken pieces!

You can get it in a pita wrap (traditional shawarma) or deconstructed as a salad (basically chicken, lettuce and sauce in a box and pita on the side). They also have a beef shawarma but I've never tried it. I'm a big fan of the chicken."}

{"text":"Although Jimmy doesn't own it anymore, the brother and sister that own it now are super friendly! Awesome food made fresh daily. I had never even tried Lebanese food but it was awesome. Be sure to grab extra napkins tho because they loaded our wraps up and it can get messy (but still easily worthwhile).

Very small inside so if you come during the rush you may need to grab it to go, but I wouldn't let that stop you from hitting this place up. 5 stars for sure!"}
