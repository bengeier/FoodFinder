{"text":"Friends and I decided to try out an Indian restaurant closer to our place rather than trek up to the reliably tasty Bombay Mahal. Big mistake. The waiter seemed annoyed at our requests (e.g., an order of channa with our samosas) and got a few things wrong, even though we clarified in both English and Hindi. The sauces were bland and overly oily, the paneer was dry (almost hard, really) and strangely sweet, and most of the dishes tasted the same. The best thing was actually the plain basmati rice. Next time we'll be going back up to Jean-Talon, even in a snowstorm."}
{"text":"Bon rapport qualité prix. Très bon poulet au beurre. Le midi, le service est rapide et de qualité."}
{"text":"Can't believe this place wasn't packed to the rafters with people, as the food is of a very high quality and also reasonably priced.  It was a Sunday night though so that could explain why it was for the most part empty.  Always a good sign was that a decent number of people came in for takeout so I didn't feel bad that we were one of the only tables dining in.....

Couldn't say I didn't thoroughly enjoy ANY of the food that came out, although I do blame the chef for ruining the rest of my night, as I ate so much I just couldn't get back into party mode....

Try it out if you like Indian food and you'll be glad you did."}
{"text":"Ding ding ding, we have a winner here! At long last, an Indian restaurant that manages to marry good food, large-ish portions, and cheap prices with a clean, balanced airy atmosphere. 

The restaurant itself is breezy and has wood floors with tablecloths. The waitstaff is very friendly and jovial, and the food is really delicious, albeit predictable (all the usual suspects are on the menu, nothing really experimental). Portions are unusually large, bucking the trend of soupbowls full of sauce and maybe a piece of meat or two at most other Indian restaurants.

This has become my new go-to place for Indian, and that's saying a lot since I live around the corner from Dev and am 5 minutes from Jean Talon, a.k.a. Little Delhi, or whatever the euphemism is for Indiantown these days. Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Was in Montreal on vacation and was lucky enough to discover this gem on St. Laurent.

Expansive but comprehensive menu featuring all of the comfort foods you'd want from an Indian place.  Simple, comfortable decor...nothing fancy.  The star of the show is really the food, which was outstanding and reasonably priced."}
{"text":"Nous sommes la veille de Noël , et Ç est là que nous avons découvert ce merveilleux restaurant , il y a quatre ans! Ç est un des seuls restos ouverts sur notre route vers la messe de minuit à l oratoire.
La bouffe est formidable! Savoureuse, fraîche, abondante, au delà de mes références en bouffe indienne!
Le Lassi à la mangue a un gout unique!
Le service est affable,  souriant et patient.
On sort toujours comblés à la Lumière de l Indes!!!"}
{"text":"I went there for lunch. Plates are big, food is okay. Price is fair. About 10-12 for soup, salad, rice, vegetables and dish. I would go there to eat once."}
{"text":"What? Come on folks. Upscale interior does nothing to fix the food. Small, overpriced portions and not very good food. Butter chicken might as well have been a dessert dish with the amount of sugar used. If you're an carni/omnivore, just forget it. For vegetarians, however, the vegetable dishes were OK and far less expensive. 

As much as I want a great Indian place around Mile End, Jean-Talon still wins. That being said, even the portions up there are shrinking weekly. 

Rating Scale:
1 Star: Avoid the town in which this place is located just to be safe.  
2 Star: With so many great places to choose from, why risk this one?
3 Star: I'll try it again or consume here in a pinch.
4 Star: I go here regularly if financially and/or calorically feasible.
5 Star: I look forward to taking my wife or friends here."}
{"text":"A definite notch above the average Montreal Indian restaurant. Food has a freshness and vibrancy. Spice arrangements have depth."}
{"text":"Went fit for lunch on a Wednesday.

Menu was restricted to a few choices, but prices were reasonable and service was timely.

I got to taste the chicken jalfrezi, tandoori and korma. All were tasty. The naan bread was also fresh and chewy.

Id have to try the full menu to make a fair comparison with other Indian restaurants in Montreal, but at the very least the food wasn't overly oily like I've often seen.

I would definitely go back given that an opportunity presents itself."}
{"text":"Absolutely fabulous. The combo classique is a great deal for two."}
{"text":"Not all bad, the atmosphere here is fine for conversation with friends. It's the former location of Cinema/Café Lumière and they kept the place similar to what it used to be (at least according to my memories, it was like 15 years ago that I was there).

The food was just passable, all fairly bland. I had a lamb biryani which was the best plate although just average. The appetizers were bland and my wife's soup was very salty. Their only dessert option was a below average rice pudding.

So, try another place!"}
{"text":"I have eaten at dozens of Indian restaurants in five different countries and this is hands down the worst. Other reviewers may have had more luck with meat dishes but as vegetarians my wife and I were shocked at how little care was taken with our dishes. The korma and vindaloo had exactly the same random mixed vegetables with no respect for the vastly different nature of each curry. The vegetables included the standard potatoes but also, disgustingly, cabbage and corn.  The vindaloo was simply spicy with no character or complexity, and the korma was sweet enough to have been served as a dessert.  The dishes' appearance was frankly disgusting, a formless mush shining with grease. As we dined at prime time on a Saturday night the restaurant has no excuse for serving food that was so obviously far from fresh.  This dining experience  was so bad as to put me off one of my favorite cuisines for a long time to come."}
{"text":"If I looked at yelp reviews before deciding to eat at this restaurant, I probably would have decided not to go in. Luckily I didn't because I was pleasantly surprised. We ordered from the classic menu for 2, which came with enough food including starters, main meal, and dessert.

We started our meal with a choice of soup or salad. The salad was very basic with a delicious dressing, and the soup was lentil in chicken broth. I ordered the soup, but unfortunately it was not my favourite dish. Our meal came with 2 simosas, and 2 onion baji, which we split. The first simosa was chicken and the second was the traditional vegetable simosa. The simosa's were light and the dough was absolutely delicious. By far the best simosa dough I have ever eaten (I have been eating indian food at least twice per month for the last 2 years). The onion baji were also delicious, however they could have used a little more salt. 

Our main meals consisted of butter chicken, lamb bhuna and and a vegetable curry. The butter chicken was absolutely delicious and not at all \"too sweet\" as one other comment suggests. Being from Montreal, I have had butter chicken that tasted like it had lots of sugar in it and this one did not taste as sweet. The flavour and texture of the butter chicken was delicious, and the chicken was very tender and not at all dry. The lamb bhuna was also delicious. My only con for the two meat dishes would be the fact that I would have enjoyed a couple of more meat pieces in each. However, I must reiterate that by the end of the meal we definitely had enough food for 2 people. 

For desert, they brought us a delicious pudding with a passion fruit coulis. The desert was such a change from the typical gulab jamun or disgusting pressed coconut we seem to get at every other indian restaurant in Montreal. Above all else I couldn't help but notice how clean the restaurant was. It is by far the cleanest indian/asian restaurant I have ever been to. And the service was to die for. The wait staff was genuinely interested in how you enjoyed your meal, and is very thankful when you like it. In my case, the only thing I did not like was the soup. When the waiter noticed, he asked why I wasn't eating it. I told him it wasn't my favourite and he apologized profusely. 

The meal in total was under $50 before taxes for the both of us. I am surprised that this place isn't filled with people on a Saturday night, what a shame. Would definitely go there again. However, I do recommend that they reprint their menus (or at least replace the plastic cases they come in)."}
{"text":"We ordered butter chicken, rogan josh, rice and naan. Rogan josh was awesome -
Lamb cooked right and great blend of spices. The only thing mediocre was chicken in butter chicken. It was not soft. Overall good food!"}
{"text":"J'adore la cuisine indienne; c'est probablement une de mes préférées. Par contre, je suis critique quand j'en mange.

J'ai goûté la soupe dahl (très salée), les entrées variées (oignon baji, poulet tikka, samosa). Les bajis étaient plutôt tièdes. Le riz biryani à l'agneau était correct, mais sans plus. J'en cuisine un bien meilleur, sans me vanter! J'ai terminé le repas par un thé masala.

Le service était gentil et attentif. Dommage, ce n'est pas le meilleur restaurant indien en ville."}
