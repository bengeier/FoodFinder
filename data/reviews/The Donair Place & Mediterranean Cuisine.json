{"text":"I've frequented the place about a dozen times, both alone and with female company. I've tried both the chicken and the beef donairs.  This is a very nice little spot. The food is cooked fresh - the meat is right off the rotisserie in front of your eyes, and as is normal for a donair place, you watch them put the garnish on in front of you. The staff has always been pleasant and entertaining in my interactions with them. Great for taking out, and the restaurant is one of the better ones for dining-in, a cut above similar places, with nicely painted walls, good furniture and decor, and not cramped like so many similar fast-food places tend to be. (Compare to the donair place at Southland Crossing - nothing against them, the food and service there are also good, but the place is a bit crowded and they only have a handful of chairs, unfortunate for those trying to sit down at lunchtime).  Parking is not a problem as they are located in a strip mall just off the former Zellers (soon to be Target).   Quality of the food has always been good."}
{"text":"Nice store front, super clean, friendly staff. We have tried this place a couple of times to give it a chance. But sad to say that every time it disappoints. It's the only Donair place close to us unfortunately. My husband and I were starving so we ordered jumbo beef donairs and well we're still hungry after eating the supposed 'jumbo' size. Based on frequenting many Donair stops the jumbo size would be considered a small at all of them. Not very good value for money either. I'd be ok if the flavour was great but it's substandard. She practically counted how many turnip pieces she put in. Thank goodness for the garlic and sweet sauce as the meat would have been super dry without it!  I don't like writing negative reviews but this place definitely needs to make some changes."}
{"text":"Thought it wasn't possible to screw up a donair, as honestly, most donair places taste more or less the same. I was wrong. This place was just cold, bland and had misleading names & prices for the donair sizes. Considering how many donair restaurants there are in this city, I can't fathom any reason for returning to this one."}
{"text":"Honestly I cannot believe this place got bad reviews ever. It is the best donair in the city. No doubt! Their beef is for sure the most flavorful around! Their house hot sauce is amazing. The secret is to add pickles. People complaining about it being too small? Its the perfect size, overly large donairs are almost impossible to eat. It gets super messy. I just moved away from the area and still go back lots when I come back.  Sweet Sauce... Amazing Hot Sauce..... Amazing Beef...... Amazing"}
{"text":"Best Donair I've had in a long while!! Fresh, clean, good quick service. You have to try it!  I'll be back sooner than later"}
{"text":"I was driving home today and I had a craving for a Donair.  It has been ages since I had a great donair,  and I knew just the spot....  The Donair place is a great little donair shop.  Their sandwhiches are sold by the weight of the donair meat,  and are made fresh as they are ordered.  They come with the regular toppings of donair sauce, lettuce, tomato, and sliced onions.  The meat ( I have been told that donair is made from beef ) is well seasoned and cooked to perfection.  They also have a chicken donair as well."}
{"text":"Not the best ive had in the city, but nothing close to me. Always a disappointment. Dry and not good. I had an argument with one guy over what sauce i could put on mine. That was a few years back, but still."}
{"text":"I was SO craving donair, and was sadly disappointed here. The beef was dry, as though it had been sitting on the spit for the whole day. I couldn't taste the sauce at all. Tomatoes were wrecked from being refrigerated. Overall just very disappointed with this and I feel I wasted my money."}
{"text":"I should have trusted the most recent yelp reviews, sorry for not listening..... I paid nearly $12 including tax for the biggest donair, and was treated to more tomatoes than meat. Now if it tasted ok maybe you get over the cost and lack of protein, but the meat was so dry it was almost as crispy as beef jerky!   Homemade hot sauce was good, thats about it.   There are much better donair joints in the SE, skip this place, it's terrible."}
{"text":"Our whole family has been eating here for years.The best donairs we have found in Calgary.Service is friendly and efficient.Place is very clean.Food is fresh.Never been disappointed."}
