{"text":"Ordered the salmon with asparagus, vegetable and baked potato. Could hear the microwave being worked hard and honestly believe that every part of the dish was microwaved. The salmon was dry and over cooked. The asparagus was stringy as if it was reheated.   We also ordered the chicken parmesan which was presented as a chicken filet covered with a slice of melted cheese and tomato sauce. Did they run out of breaded chicken or bread crumbs? If so, then the cook should have advised that grilled chicken would be used and charged accordingly. When you order chicken parm because you are in the mood for chicken parm, the camouflage does not work. Not very busy for a Monday night. So perhaps the cook was having an off night. Maybe it will be better on the weekend?"}
{"text":"Want for the weekend brunch and had a great time. The manager is Sashi and he is possibly the nicest restaurant manager I've come across he greets every table and personally ensures you have everything you need. Our server Raj kept our coffee cups full and checked on us every few mins. The guy manning the omelette bar was also super nice, for example once he found out that I dont eat pork or bacon he recommended that I try their turkey bacon and sausage and a few minutes later he brought some freshly cooked turkey bacon and sausage to my table. Overall I had a great experience and will be returning soon, only regret is not having discovered this place earlier."}
{"text":"Golden Nasty, more like it. Slowest service ever despite the fact we went Saturday morning when at least half the patrons were eating the buffet. Subpar quality food. Eggs Benedict was served with congealed canned hollendaise sauce and the home fries were straight out of a bag. Good place for hungover university crowd, but nobody else. Not going back."}
{"text":"My ex-GF and I have been coming here almost every Monday morning for over a year, and this Golden Griddle location has proven to be a great breakfast place to start our week with! This particular restaurant is sizeable, with plenty of seating available. You will never have to wait long for service here, and that service is very fast and efficient. Our waiter always remembers our regular orders, (Pancakes for her, Bacon & Eggs for me), and he brings us our tea and coffee immediately, with a friendly smile. One or the other of us will occasionally choose Turkey bacon, which is a nice option. This is a very comfortable place to come for breakfast, and is rarely crowded on a Monday morning. Of course, Golden Griddle Restaurants feature a large buffet, and are terrific places for group breakfasts. A great choice for the Sunday church crowd. I have always found the food here to be delicious."}
{"text":"Went for Weekend brunch and it's really good! Made to order omelettes and open buffet for $12.99! Lots of things here.. waffles, pancakes, hash browns, wedges, fresh fruit, FRENCH TOAST (THE BEST!!!) and a bunch of other desserts. Great food! Wish they had told me the juice I ordered wasn't included... $2.59 for a glass of OJ is way too much.. so one star off.   Anyway,  I still recommend the weekend buffet here! Server was very friendly and the made to order omelette waa delicious!"}
{"text":"This place needs to renovate and do a proper job of cleaning it. Floors, chairs and tables and everything around was dirty and the washroom I don't really know how to comment about. When I walked in to clean my pants after realizing I was seating on syrup that someone spilled earlier on the seat it smelled like 20 people puked and my stomach immediately turned upside down. The food was nice, the usual breakfast food but when you realize how dirty it is around you start feeling gross."}
{"text":"I chose the Omelette Classic which had three eggs available with different toppings and served with a choice of three buttermilk, buckwheat, or grain pancakes or toast with homefries.  I chose the option of having feta, spinach, black olives, and tomatoes on my omelette with grain pancakes.  Ken also chose the Omelette Classic but with Swiss cheese, spinach, and grilled mushrooms and with toast and homefries.  I enjoyed my Omelette Classic with feta, spinach, black olives, and tomatoes.  It was definitely a very healthy and clean omelette as was Ken's.  The feta cheese really was a good mix with the omelette.  The homefries were crispy and crunchy.  I really liked the grain pancakes.  They were healthy and you could taste the hard grains in every bite."}
{"text":"Mmmm I love all-day breakfast joints.  I came here twice with my former co-workers during our lunch hour and both times were pleasant.  I would not say this restaurant is amazing.  It's decent, and I will explain further below.    Number of People: During the lunch hours, there were not many patrons, mainly 1 or 2 other parties, and they were usually seniors out for a walk.  This is not usually a good sign, though I do have to admit that the location of this place is a little bit out of the way.  Service: The staff members were professional, depending on who was on shift. I found the older gentlemen to be very attentive and often checked up on us, whereas the older woman rarely came over unless we waved her down.  Food and Price: I love getting the big breakfast platters (I forgot the name, unfortunately), which is usually composed of juice, home fries, french toast/pancakes, bacon/sausages/peameal, toast, and eggs done to your liking - all for an affordable 10-11-ish dollars.  This is a pretty average price for these types of platters at an all-day breakfast restaurant. If you have a small appetite, you may want to share with another person, but I love my salty and greasy breakfast foods, so I obviously hogged mine mmmm!  Please be advised that all the items were fine, except for the pancakes.  The pancakes were not fluffy and light, but rather somewhat rubbery.  I wouldn't go as far to say they were unappetizing because they had a decent flavour, but any presence of \"fluffiness\" and \"softness\" only came through when I DROWNED the pancakes in maple syrup.    Overall, I would come again if I was craving breakfast food in that area, but I would advise getting french toast instead of the pancakes."}
{"text":"I've been to this Golden Griddle location a number of times, by myself and with others. I usually get the same thing - but it always arrives quickly and is delicious. I'm a serious 'breakfast for dinner' person, so I love places where I can get pancakes and French toast all day!  And this is one of the few Golden Griddles left that I've seen.   Service is always fast and friendly. Oddly, faster when they're busier because they have more staff available.  The restaurant itself could use a renovation, but it doesn't seem to impact the food.   The only downside is that they have terrible coffee!"}
{"text":"The one and only time I went there with friends, we left after 45 min and no food on the table. We had ordered simple things like pancakes and Chilli (which is ready). We saw all tables around us being served despite the fact that they cane after us. Nobody even came to apologize or tell us what's going on. We were really bothered after 30min, but still decided to give them some more time. After that we walked out and nobody even came after us to see why we are leaving. I live 5min away and it was not worth it for me. I went home and ate there."}
{"text":"3  Came with a groupon tonight ($7 for $20 worth of food).   Had:   Steak dinner ($12.99) - thinnest, saddest looking steak I've ever seen at a white person restaurant (Think Chinese style mixed grill flat steak). They asked how I wanted it done. I said medium rare. My steak was well done. Quite well done. Quite disappointing. Mashed potatoes were dry, although the gravy helped save them. The veggies were a tad soggy, but they pass. Garlic bread was crispy and delicious and garlicky.  Fish and chips ($11.99 + $1 upgrade for sweet potato fries) - Fish was firm. Batter was crispy. For that price, I expected the pieces of fish to be about twice as large. Once again, garlic bread was good. Tartar sauce is packaged (Heinz? Kraft? Something like that). Generous portion of sweet potato fries. Really good sweet potato fries. Not matchstick thin, but also not really thick. Crispy too.  Super loaded Bacon, Lettuce and Tomato sandwich ($7.99 + $1 upgrade for sweet potato fries) - See previous comments on sweet potato fries. Got a choice of white or brown bread. Chose brown. Multigrain? Something like that. For something that I believe was called super loaded, it wasn't super loaded. I mean, it had about twice the amount of bacon as a regular BLT, but I wouldn't call it super. BLT doesn't have mayo on it. I asked for it, and they did give it to me with no extra charge, so I'll give them that one. In hindsight, the menu said that it was supposed to come with EITHER fries AND cabbage salad. I did not get cabbage salad. I don't know whether I was supposed to or not.  Lone waitress in the restaurant. We got there around 8:30, so there was only one other table. Waitress was super tired, and it showed, but she did give us pretty good service. She even inquired as to how our meal was going.  All in all, after more than 10 years, it was a trip down memory lane, coming back to Golden Griddle. If it's still here in 10 years, maybe I'll come again. Actually, I'll probably be back sooner than that."}
{"text":"On those days you just want a diner (Low Key and Good Food) I was pleasantly surprised when my sister and I spent our lunch hour at Golden Griddle : on Laird.  First time there: Tues, where they had an all you can eat \"pancake\" buffet + ($10)... ( Yummy if your in a pancake mood, plus it was Mardi Gras Fat Tuesday so we wanted to go somewhere to bring a bit of New Orleans to us in T.O. :)  )  Not only was the food good and the place very cozy ... the service was crazy outstanding... where the manager not only came to ask if everything was ok ... but the staff was very friendly and made it feel like we were dining in a small town ... which is rare when you live in a big city. Sweet! :)"}
{"text":"I got dragged here kicking and screaming a few days ago.  This has never been my favourite place.  Not many people here and the server let us know we could take any table we want.  (I was thinking a table at another restaurant....lol).  Anyhow we sat by a window.  There is no view as the restaurant is below street level.  Anyway the server was very friendly, natural and quite efficient.  Nothing wrong with my Diet Pepsi and re-fills came quickly.  Others at the table didn't care for the coffee and thought it was quite weak. I had the Chicken, Swiss cheese & Broccoli Omelette with 3 Buckwheat Pancakes.  The omelette was not at all fluffy....kind of flat & lifeless.  There was a fair bit of broccoli which was nice but very little chicken & Swiss.  The pancakes were very, very dry.  I make buckwheat pancakes at home and it isn't difficult to make them moist.  A rather bland meal would be a generous description. The other folks seemed to like the food and are regulars at this location.  I guess there's no accounting for taste.....lol.  The food was well below average but the service was VERY good and my diet pop was up to snuff.....hence the 3 rating.  Quite honestly chains like Denny's, Perkins or Cora's serve superior breakfast.  IMHO Sunset Grill is the best of the chains that I'm aware of in the GTA."}
{"text":"If you sit outside don't expect any service. It seems they completely forget about the tables out there and worse, walk away when you go inside to enquire about the delay. Food is average but not worth the 45 min wait for a breakfast order."}
{"text":"I arrived here on a Saturday morning for buffet brunch. While the restaurant was packed, there was no line up and there was always 1-2 tables empty for people when the arrived. Excellent table management. Service was very friendly, and the food was enjoyable. My favourite part of this buffet is that at the very end of the food table, you can request a custom omelet from the chef. They whip it up for you on the spot, but be patient as it is from scratch. The atmosphere feels very homey. You don't feel like you left your own kitchen, so take that into consideration if you want to feel like you are celebrating something away from home. I definitely recommend the weekend brunch."}
{"text":"A nice breakfast place with a great weekend buffet. There are a lot of options for kids and lacto-ovo-vegetarian options. But almost nothing much for vegans. The Coffee served is good. We used Groupons- for 8$ we used to get 20$ worth of credit, which was enough for 2 people to order from menu. The buffet costs 14.99+ taxes.  There is a big parking lot, next to the restaurant.  It has a patio and a big dining area. It good place for a weekend family gathering. Service is good.  Food: portions are fine, not huge... I prefer their waffles over pancakes. Eggs are small in size. Nothing exceptional but a decent breakfast. Buffet is awesome!"}
{"text":"Was there with a friend this morning. Each had the breakfast buffet at $14.95.  Very pricey considering coffee is not included. Food choices were all exceptionally cheap and of poor quality. Waffles were like roof shingles, eggs were powdered and scrambled only. A few choices of fruit which were not fresh. Although omelettes made to order were an option included, no one was standing close by and when asked for an omelette got a roll of the eyes. With coffee ($2.50 extra) tax and tip bill came to $45.00! Absolutely not a good value considering low quality of offerings. Place also had very dated decor and  looked like it needed a good cleaning!!"}
{"text":"The Golden Griddle used to be all over the place, and when I lived in Toronto, it was one of my all time favourite breakfast / pancake houses. I wish they had them in Ottawa! So glad we went here, just for something different. I would give this place a 3.5 stars if only I could.  Nice selection of menu offerings - surely you will find something to appeal to the palate. I would go back, especially if they were closer to home.  I got 2 perfectly poached eggs on brown toast, fried potatoes (which were only ok, in my opinion), and bacon. It was a lot of food - I didn't finish the potatoes.  We had the place virtually to ourselves, as it was relatively early. What I thought was weird about the service was that the waiter brought us 1 package of peanut butter and 1 or 2 of jam. Why not bring a bowl and give us the choice?  On the other hand, a nice touch was free Toronto Sun newspapers.  Oddly, there is a buffet service set up, but they only offer that on weekends, and we went during the week. Too bad for us! But I thought they might be able to move it to the side?! Oh well.  It was tasty and lots of food on the plate without being an exhorbitant amount or cost. I would probably go there more often if I lived closer. Or if they had one locally!!"}
{"text":"lovely breakfast place. everything's so affordable. my coworkers and i went here after a night shift and the place was empty but people started to trickle in once 9am rolled around. good service with daily specials. I got the sunny special which came with 2 eggs, choice of bacon or sausage, and choice of pancakes or toast with potatos - all for 5.99$. i didn't like my pancakes cuz they were a bit too dry in my opinion, and i had asked for over medium eggs but got over easy instead"}
{"text":"Tried the weekend brunch buffet due to a Groupon deal. It's $13.99 per adult for weekend brunch buffet. The Groupon was $10 for $20 worth of food and can be used for the buffet. It's nothing fancy but it has all the basics and a little more. They even have an omelette/egg station so you can have your eggs made to your preference. I asked for over medium and they were still a little undercooked but not bad. They have a fair variety of toppings for omelettes (tomatoes, cheese, onions, ham, peppers and some others I can't remember). The food overall was pretty good and with the Groupon, I would say it was a great deal. I like this location; the restaurant felt very cozy and had some old school charm to it. They have 4-5 types of cereals, toast, yogurt, and muffins and a whole bunch of other goodies. Didn't really get to try all the pastries since we were in a rush but would consider going back again."}
{"text":"We used the Groupon that was $12 for a $20 voucher and went for the breakfast buffet. Honestly almost all buffets where you get up and get your food are usually mediocre. I'm not expecting any of the food items to wow me. The food wasn't very hot. They had scrambled eggs, French toasts, tater tots, bacon, breakfast sausages, fruits, yogurt, toast, pancakes, bagels, muffins, jams, waffles and an omelette station. I don't think I'll be coming back here, the quality of the buffet food is just okay and the other menu ordered items looked mediocre as well (from looking at what other tables ordered). One thing to note and I'm not sure if this was just a one-off day, is that it was very cool outside, however once we stepped into the restaurant, it was boiling, no ventilation whatsoever. So that may have also affected my experience there as well."}
{"text":"came here on several locations.   Very dead location... i loveeeee pancakes.  i even came once for the all you can eat pancake tuesday for 5.99  ... what a mistake that was.. i was in a food coma for 12 hours after... also you realize you cant eat as much pancakes as you thought u can...(that and also realizing its all horrible carbs your eating)...  still good.. would definitely come back.  sad to see golden griddles are not doing well in ontario.. they just keep closing down."}
