{"text":"Went for first time last night and thought that the Food was excellent IMO. A friend and I shared the Naan Basket, Dal Tadka and the Manchurian Gobi and it was GREAT! Loved every bite! Excited they are so close.  I do agree with the others that the service and environment was a little less than inviting, but nothing bad enough to keep me from ordering again. Food Quality, Portion size, and Taste  trumped any other opinions I may have considered : ]"}
{"text":"Good Indian food. I have lived in India this place is decent and I recommend it, but am not at all amazed or impressed. Just pleasantly satisfied"}
{"text":"Had lamb Rogan josh with garlic naan bread. Pretty delicious. Got takeout was ready in ten minutes."}
{"text":"Seriously dare to go to this place if you are looking for biryani..worst biryani ever..please change the name to pullav ...pullav is much better than this biryani...I truly regret for going to this place.."}
{"text":"Doesn't look like much from the outside but the inside is nice, very clean. I had the chettinadu chicken curry and really liked it, my boyfriend had the tandoori chicken and I liked that too. Service was very good. I think it's one of the better Indian places I've been to in North Phoenix"}
{"text":"I agree with the previous review. The glass on top of the tables has to go. It prevents waiters from changing the table clothes on a regular basis. They are disgustingly dirty. The food is good, but since the tables are so dirty it really makes me question the cleanliness of the kitchen and even the quality of meat that is being used.  I want your business to succeed, but you have to make some serious changes about the cleanliness. At this point I don't even want to come back and only consider takeout. I wish you all the best though."}
{"text":"First trip. Ordered take out consisting of the Manchurian Gobi (deep fried cauliflower with an Asian sauce that came with delicious vegetable fried rice), Chicken Tikka Masala, the bread/naan assortment and a couple of orders of Raita (Indian yogurt salad-sauce). Food was delicious, hot, fresh, carefully packed and generously portioned, I'll be back. Bill was $40, fed 3."}
{"text":"So happy to find this little gem of Vegetarian goodness! Great food, generous pricing and portions....We have told many and will continue to do so....Ypu are in our neighborhood and we are thrilled!"}
{"text":"My friends and I ordered food from Mantra through Grub Hub who delivered to their house. It was so good we ordered again the following weekend. Excellent!"}
{"text":"Yum! My boyfriend loves Indian food so we were trying to find a good place for his Birthday dinner and stumbled upon this place on yelp. You can always tell if it's going to be good by the Samosas! They were spot on, we also got the Vegetable Pakoras which were delicious. We are vegetarian and this place has so many great options! For the dinner the 3 of us (including our 13 year  old daughter) shared Aloo Gobhi, Dal Tadka, and the Paneer Butter Masala. Everything was awesome. Our daughter can't handle spice so we got everything mild and she could and did eat EVERYTHING. The garlic Naan was perfect. The service was also great, our waiter seemed very happy to be there and enjoyed what he did. Very happy with our experience and we will be back for sure!"}
{"text":"Omg! This place is me and my husbands new favorite place!!! We were looking for a good spot for Indian food near by and came across this place. We figured we give it a try and we were pleasantly surprised. We ordered the chicken tikka masala/Butter chicken/Tandoori chicken with garlic naan....AMAZING! We have dined here twice already and we are so impressed we will be regulars :) 5 's for sure!!! And we will be bringing our friends/family. I'm not one for reviews but felt I needed to share this place with the world!"}
{"text":"My first time eating at this fabulous Indian Cuisine.  Excellent service and food.  Being new to the area, I'll be back."}
{"text":"Not the best Indiana food in Phoenix. Portions were relatively small, and the lack of rice they provided made it hard to eat the actual meal without ordering double rice. Food was mostly sauce, with little protein and veggies. Totally empty when we were there."}
{"text":"I visited this restaurant for the first time on Friday. Food was good and reasonably priced. Clean and pleasant place to dine. Service was excellent -very quick and efficient. Friendly and attentive staff."}
{"text":"I'm so happy to have a good Indian restaurant in the neighborhood! This place is casual, the menu is strait forward what you'd expect, and the prices and preparation are great. We had the masala, the korma, samosas, and a naan, it was all perfectly delicious. My wife and I will definitely be back, and I can see us getting take here too. It's just a solid, reasonably priced, casual Indian food restaurant done well. I highly recommend it if you're in the neighborhood and hankering for some tandoori. Two thumbs up."}
{"text":"Good food but I ordered through postmates and my order did not include garlic naan as listed on the in app menu. I called and asked about it and they insisted that they only do combos for lunch and would not do anything about the misrepresentation on the menu. Not a huge deal but was looking forward to the naan with my food! Just posting so others ordering dinner to go can be aware."}
{"text":"My husband and I stopped  by for lunch.  The food was amazing!  We shared the lamb curry.  The lamb was very tender.  The lunch special had so much for very little price.  We were so full by the time we finished.  The Naan bread,  samosa, tea,  etc was all included.  Very satisfied.  We will definitely be back!  All my friends will be hearing about this wonderful place!  PS: the wait staff was amazing as well. 5 stars all the way!"}
{"text":"My wife and I found this gem after visiting her parents in the area. We had been to the same location years before and were not impressed. But these are new owners, and there is fresh décor (not overstated but clean). Music was at an appropriate level. The servers were very friendly. Food was delicious. For several dishes, you can select cheese of your favorite protein (e.g.,  lamb). I had British Tikka Masala with paneer cheese. Neither of us had digestion issues."}
{"text":"Good food, sweet staff, nothing fancy, but it here's the spot when you have the craving."}
{"text":"Worst North Indian food around and didnt dare to taste biryani after the shock.."}
{"text":"Found some silvery powder chunks in the aloo paratha. Doesn't look edible. Also they use a lot of color in the food. I had ordered vindaloo n aloo paratha . May not order from here again"}
{"text":"I have been to countless Indian Restaurants around the US and in Europe and this is one of the BEST. The service was great and the food was phenomenal! I have never had the kind of flavor that I had at Mantra!"}
{"text":"Overall good food with understated, but attentive service.  Prices are reasonable.    For our family, one appetizer (shared) + 1 main dish per person worked out about perfectly.   We stuck with chicken dishes, which might have benefitted from a little more time simmering to add depth of flavor, but was tasty enough that we'll be back."}
{"text":"Amazing food. The assorted bread basket was awesome because you got to try all the different naan they make. We drove 5 miles to eat here and it was worth the drive. We also had the palak paneer and it was delicious."}
{"text":"Another Saturday night dinner here! As usual Roberta had chicken korma. I had the onion and chili salad (sliced onions and sliced jalapeño) the chicken tiki masala. I also had my usual.. Mango lassi.. So good. The salad of onions and jalapeño peppers was a little too spicy with the jalapeños but the onions went well with the tiki masala! We also had gulab judum(SP) for dessert.. Good but probably not something that we would order again. All of this accompanied by garlic naan. As usual a WONDERFUL dinner... You NEED TO come and enjoy the food!!!"}
{"text":"This is not a good place for Indian food at all. The atmosphere is very shabby and very run down. The butter chicken I ordered was disgusting. The chicken felt weird and had a strange texture. The spice was not great at all even though I asked for the highest level. The samboosa were cold. The rice pudding was frozen which is odd and had the taste of freezer burn. I was not enthused and will not be returning."}
{"text":"I asked for no heat for my meal and it was So Good!!!!!! We will return. We used a Groupon this time. Delicious!!! I enjoyed the saag. My hubby asked for super spicy and got it!!! Great waiter as well."}
{"text":"Very cozy, very clean, the owner is very friendly and the food is amazing. The Tandori chicken is a nice combination of sweet and spicy and the tikka masala is wonderfully spicy. VERY AFFORDABLE"}
{"text":"Favorite Indian restaurant in Arizona by far! Placed my first order tonight. They were friendly and accurate over the phone and to my delight they told me my order would be ready in 15-20 mins. I think I picked up from the owner, who was kind and chatty. The restaurant is humble yet very clean and neat. My to-go order was carefully wrapped so as not to leak any yummy sauce in my car (THANK YOU!). I ordered tandoori chicken, butter chicken and garlic naan for my daughters. As you can see from the picture my 3 year old was very happy with her food! The food is absolutely delicious and fresh tasting! You need the butter chicken in your life- trust! :) I'm off to dive in to my lamb biryani, veggie samosa and a glass of white wine (not provided by the restaurant)...I already can't wait to return and try the other menu items."}
{"text":"The butter chicken and anything with the lamb in it is so flavorful! So delicious and the people that work here are so nice! A must try!"}
{"text":"I'm SUPER surprised by our experience with this food!!! After all the good reviews I was expecting something great here, but this is probably the worst Indian food I've ever had!?! I know that's a huge statement, but for real! honestly...this is the BLANDEST Indian food I've ever had. The chicken tikka masala sauce didn't even taste like masala sauce!? It was so watered down...there was no spice at all...and I'm not talking about spiciness/heat, I'm talking about flavor! I had no interest in finishing it...The naan was overly chewy and hard to bite into. We ordered the garlic and butter naans. The garlic naan looked good, but it just had a bunch of raw garlic sprinkled on top...and the \"butter\" naan looks and tastes like regular naan, so nothing special with either of those. My Hubby ordered the chicken biryani. He said it was horrible...it resembled a generic/fake fried rice of some sort...it didn't look like a real biryani. This is coming from a guy who's not picky!!! He always cleans his plate and he couldn't finish this rice, and he was hungry!!!  I'm sorry to give such a bad review, but this food was very subpar...if you're looking for great, tasty, always fresh, authentic Indian go to Indian Paradise instead. You WILL NOT be disappointed!"}
{"text":"First time customer. Ordered for Takeout.  Customer service was great both over the phone and in person. Food was hot and delicious. Spice level was great. Hot but not too hot. Seemed a bit pricy for one entree and some naan, but would visit again."}
{"text":"Not very good...everythibg was too salty to eat. And in addition, the check in offer was not honored due to our doing take out even though it said \"all dinners\""}
{"text":"Very casual but super delish!! I just moved to the area and gave it a try... And I'm glad I did! The vindaloo was fantastic!"}
{"text":"Q: What's a couple to do when one person loves spicy food and the other prefers mild cuisine?  A: Go to Mantra! Mantra has been fantastic about making flavorful but mild vegetarian dishes for me while keeping my boyfriend satisfied with carnivore entrees with a kick. We always order take-out, so I can't comment on the table-cloth issues noted by other reviewers, but we've had friendly, prompt service and delicious food every single visit (and we've had quite a few visits!). My only complaints are the hours (I'd love it if they were open between 2:30 and 5:00) and the amount of saran wrap around our take-out dishes: while the saran wrap most certainly prevents spillage, the layers are so thick that it's like an archeological dig to find the treasures buried inside."}
{"text":"Found this via groupon; ordered their lunch combos; food was fresh; taste levels can be even better"}
{"text":"I have been in twice since they opened up by me. Their restaurant is very well kept and clean. The service is very fast. If you are hungry, you are not kept waiting! They even recognized me after I had only been in once before. Quality service and great food at a decent price? I'll take it!"}
{"text":"This place is great! It's a clean, cozy restaurant with very attentive workers. We came on Easter Sunday, so it wasn't very busy.  The lunch special is a great deal. You get plenty of food, especially for what you pay."}
{"text":"Excellent food! Very nice staff and consistent quality....I'm real wimp and they make very mild for me....I highly recommend"}
{"text":"Although the Tikka Masala was delicious, the Garlic naan I was given had bits of sand or dirt in it from the oven and it made that grainy crunch noise every time I ate. I feel insulted by that bread that was given to me especially since I was their first customer of the day. Again, Very upset that I ate the sand like bread. I have pictures of the sand should proof be required"}
{"text":"Awesome Indian food. My favorite is the Assorted Bread Basket that comes with Garlic Naan, Onion Bread, Roti and plain Naan.  A must try is the Chicken Tikka, Chicken Tandoori, Chicken Briyani and the Butter Chicken.  Now you have try the Mango Lassi."}
{"text":"It's not a buffet, thank goodness. Come here for lunch, instead of a dirty steam table of dodgy dishes, they have a nice selection of combo meals from $8.99. All the stuff you'd get in the buffet, but fresh.   The lunch combos come with a samosa, rice, naan, three minty stuff, tamarindy condiment, and the spongy dessert deal. You have a dozen choices of curries and other typical preparations, and the further choice of protein. It comes on a cute metal tray; like a school lunch of Indian goodness.  If you expected the run-down Indian place that was in this location years ago, think again. This restaurant is totally re-done. It's all new and very clean."}
{"text":"Fantastic!! Traditional curry and chicken tikka masala with buttered naan. Felt like we were back in India. Really good!"}
{"text":"The Gobi Manchurian is so good it's a must try. Everything tastes so good. Staff is friendly and you can taste the quality in the food."}
{"text":"I tried this as it is closer to home. I ordered Chicken Tikka didnt realize it did not come with any sauce. This was my only disappointment."}
{"text":"Mantra is another fine example of Indian food in Phoenix.  Offering their take on many traditional Indian and Indo-Chinese dishes, this restaurant proves once again how lucky we are to have a large Indian population in Phoenix.        Having sampled a great deal from this menu I can say without a doubt it is the most consistent Indian food restaurant I have tried.  From the assorted breads, appetizers, and currys, I have yet to taste one item that was good if not great.  Since there is so much going on menu wise I'll stick to reviewing my go-to lately.  Bhel Puri; fried lentils, potato, peanut, onion, tomato, mint, yogurt, and tamarind served cold almost resembling a dip but eaten as is.  It's a great mixture of flavors and texture, a very refreshing start to a meal.  Next is the Chili Paneer.  It's an indo-chinese dish consisting or fried paneer cubes smothered in a chilli sauce with a vegetable fried rice.  Although not traditional Indian, it's hard to not order this as it's so delicious.  The large chunks of paneer with the sweet chilli sauce are just out of this world good and the vegetable fried rice has a perfect blend of fresh vegetables while also not being oily or greasy.  Like stated previously I have tasted a large portion of the menu and I have yet to be satisfied by the food.  In regards to the restaurant itself, it's a simple dining room with classic restaurant lighting.  The staff are friendly and more then willing to help you figure out the menu, they also are more than willing to adjust heat to taste so don't be afraid  to ask."}
{"text":"Mmmm not so sure about them It's a new place and I order a pick up  For some reason everything I ordered seems very small  The flavor was ok , not very authentic . They give you a free dessert with the yelp but it was all soggy. The team is nice and smiley  The place in the most part is clean  I normally do Indian Buffet not much of the dinner and I won't do dinner again in this place"}
{"text":"Great place but the water tastes like metal and one of the bathrooms is out of commission. Yeah the food tastes good but fix the freaking water! Seriously, the water has tasted like metal for over a year now!!!! Why the heck is this crap still being served to people? It takes my trust away from this place. Once the water is fixed and the bathroom is back in commission then I will give this place 5 stars. Until then you get 3 stars and I will complain to the food safety.gov people.  You guys have had over a year to fix the metallic water. I'm done complaining and I'll let some food inspector figure out what the issue it."}
{"text":"First time there, quaint little place, lovely owner.  The lamb vindaloo and goat curry were excellent.  Will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Yummy food, kind service and Clean facility!!  I had the Tandoori Chicken and it was delicious, it was seasoned perfectly and the flavor was great."}
{"text":"The food here can't be beat.  The service can be spotty but the food makes up for it.  Lunch is kinda bento box like but everything is delicious."}
{"text":"If you enjoy Indian cuisine, you must try Mantra Indian Cuisine on 16th St and Bell.   The food is delicious,  perfect food portions, very reasonable prices, and the service was outstanding!"}
{"text":"I have worst experience with this restaurant. We orders food through postmates day before yesterday.We ordered chicken curry and tandoori chicken. Tandoori chicken is frozen one which I got I think it's almost week ago food and I ask for spicy but it's not at all tasty, no salt and spicy. We spending money for the frozen food is very bad... and also full of red colour. They can use colour but not too much. Very bad and worst experience."}
{"text":"This little place is near our home so we decided to check it out...Heck with all the Neon it's hard to miss! The service was polite and welcoming. We ordered several favorites and naan as well. Everything was delicious! All the complex flavors and spices one enjoys with Indian cuisine. It was a enjoyable evening and we will return! Keep it up Mantra!"}
{"text":"Ok so listen. I have never had Indian cuisine before and let me tell you, this place has opened my eyes and has given me new hope in living. The food was excellent, the staff was excellent, the whole experience was excellent. Places like this are the reason I am a foodie. If you go I suggest ordering Naan bread, so simple yet so delicious. Yes, go here for food."}
{"text":"The food hits all the right notes with the flavor and spice. It's so delicious. I was always spoiled for choice for Indian cuisine in the U.K., but I'm relieved to have found Mantra nearby me here in AZ. The garlic naan is wonderful, and I adore the dal tadka and mutter paneer."}
{"text":"Last time I ordered a simple panipuri and they served it with cold masala ,when I asked the same with owner as why it's not hot ,he was telling it's the correct way of eating  and was asking which part of India I came from  I replied that we would expect it to be served at room temperature at least if not hot,then he brought it back by putting in oven  This was really bad experience"}
{"text":"Love this place. Great food, good portions, and the wait staff was wonderful. Had the veggie samosa(YUM), tandoori chicken, butter paneer masala (Delish), gobi Manchurian(Awesome!), and garlic naan. All the dishes were really good and fresh, I prefer veggie dishes, so was really thrilled with how flavorful they were. Husband had a mango lassi too, loved it. It was alot of food so we took left overs home. It will be enough for another entire meal."}
{"text":"Off the hook, ridiculously insane flavor.  Lamb Vindaloo today with garlic Naan and a Samosa.    Extremely well priced and I wish I could keep this place a secret.     Delightful proprietor and my new go-too.    Get in your car and drive....now."}
{"text":"It was a drive by serendipity - an epiphany - the universe showed us the way.  It was our luck the restaurant we had chosen was closed... then we saw Mantra Indian Cuisine.  It was magical.  The food was not just good... It was beautiful.  Word cannot express the joy and symphony of subtle flavors we enjoyed.  The portions are generous and the prices are fair.  The cuisine is the star.  Wishing them all the luck the universe can conjure.  We will be back.  - Try the curry goat...  and butter chicken.  Wonderful, simply wonderful."}
{"text":"Called in a take out order. They made me something for me that was not on the menu. Warm greeting. The food was sealed really well it would not spill in my car. Everything was awesome and this is coming from someone who grew up on this food in the UK. Rice was fluffy, tender chicken. Great Nan bread and good popadums. Great portions, so have lunch for tomorrow. Will go back soon. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"Greeted upon entering.  7 tables and 4 booths in this clean place.  Decor was simple.  No one here during dinner so we were rather hesitant.  We decided on Chicken Vindaloo, Chana Masala, and plain naan.  We were asked what spice level we wanted for the vindaloo.  We went for mild to medium.  In the meantime, several customers came to get their take out dishes.  All the dishes came quickly and together along with rice.  The vindaloo was perfect with just enough spice.  Any more spice would have been too much.  The Chicken was tender and the potatoes soaked the sauce.  The Chana masala was delicious.  The naan was plentiful and good for sopping up sauces.  A very enjoyable meal.  Plenty of parking in this mall.  Prices are equivalent to most Indian restaurants."}
{"text":"I ordered the dinner special on Postmates and we did not receive any napkins and flatware with our delivery. The dinner special also included naan and we did not receive that. While the food was average Indian food, I was not satisfied with being given less than I paid for."}
{"text":"I ordered the Veggie Biryani, and it was fabulous! Was the most amazing Vegetable Biryani that I have had in a long time. I moved to Phoenix from NJ, and NJ is known for its great Indian food. I will tell you one thing, this biryani was better than even the most famous Indian restaurants in NJ. Great work and keep it up!"}
{"text":"This our new favorite Indian place. Ordered through postmates and was delighted to find near and tidy containers packed with flavor. We had no leftovers. Ordered 2 vegetarian dishes, one was cauliflower and something, the other I don't recall the name. Third dish was butter chicken. Had the veggie pakoras, garlic naan and basmati rice. Only a small bit of leftovers because it w as so good. Can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"Clean environment. Quiet. Polite servers. Food was moderately priced. Food quality was good. The only real complaint I have is that I asked for my Chicken Tikka Masala to be VERY SPICEY (a 10 on the spicy scale) and although it was tasty and flavorful, it was not very spicy at all. I may be back at some point to give them another chance to get it right since the server was so polite."}
{"text":"This place is amazing! Such great food. I had saag paneer lunch special and it was perfect! The mango lassi was delicious.... and I loved how every lunch special came with chai. The staff was attentive and kind. We dined with an 11 month old and a 3 year old. They made us feel welcomed. Great service, amazing food. Can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"We decided to try this place on Postmates due to the good reviews. It was honestly some of the worst Indian food we've ever had. First off they didn't get the order right, left out a diet coke and a garlic naan. Second we asked for both the Chicken Tikka Masala and Butter Chicken to be MILD, I love spicy, hot food, but my husband does not. This was the hottest food I have ever had, it was barely edible (even for me). The veggie samosas were OK, but they did not come with any sauce which was disappointing. We felt like it was $50 wasted and have to say that will never eat here again."}
{"text":"Had the pleasure of coming here for dinner the other night we took a friend Of ours who hasn't experienced the world of Indian food and wanted him to try something new. We were not disappointed!  We ordered samosas, naan, chicken curry, palaak paneer and shrimp korma. The food was seasoned appropriately and the service was fantastic. Very attentive and accommodating for our spice level and take out order ( mango lassi and Kheer).  I would have given it a five star rating but the shrimp korma we ordered didn't have much shrimp in it but the flavor was fantastic. I also felt the food was a little pricey for the neighborhood considering there are a few Indian restaurants within a 2 mile radius.  * side note..., it saddens me to see fellow Indians give such negative reviews all the time. It's not only for this restaurant but many, many other restaurants out there. We are not a huge community here in Phoenix and we should be more uplifting and supportive of our fellow Indians and their establishments. Such negativity doesn't help anyone."}
{"text":"Excellent food and service. Simple decor with quiet music to set the tone.   Good menu with all the traditional Indian selections you'd expect with clear descriptions of each one. The back page of the menu listed a few \"Indo-Asian  dishes. Unexpected but once you read the descriptions it's easy to see the culinary relationship.   Chicken saag and lamb khorma were superb. Vegetable samosas were light and delicious. Indian ice tea is so good you won't miss beer or wine - good since no alcohol served here. Go to Mantra for some of the best Indian food in town."}
{"text":"Portions are fairly small and dishes are a bit pricey. However, the food is always exceptional. I recommend the butter chicken and chicken tikka."}
{"text":"I must agree with previous yelpers about the tablecloths under glass, not attractive and does detract a bit from dining experience. Food was good, standard north indian cuisine, good taste and quality. The Saag was excellent, creamy and just the right spice at a medium although next time I might go up in spice just for the heck of it.  The chicken Tikka Masala was good, chicken just a tad bit overdone, mild disturbance in tastiness of dish yet overall pretty yummy. The garlic Naan was relish, samosa ok, rice was cooked perfectly, Gulab Jamin meh (not a big fan anyway).  The price and quantity of lunch specials was right on point.  The atmosphere and service were a bit lackluster yet if you just want to eat decent Indian food and are not there for the total dining experience, Mantra is a very good choice. We left full and very satisfied, would definitely be back especially since it is close to home."}
{"text":"My first time ever eating Indian cuisine and I love it! You can smell all of the spices in each dish and definitely taste it. Portions were generous."}
{"text":"I have driven by several times, and decided to check it out.  Upon arrival we were seated immediately.  I ordered the Punjabi spinach saag with chicken and my husband ordered the Goan Vindaloo.  Both were delicious.  The Vindaloo had a little spice,  but it did not take away from the flavor.  We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"I liked Indian food before I came here with my husband. This restaurant made me LOVE Indian food! We got a vindaloo dish with lamb, butter chicken and tikka masala with chicken and oh. My. Goodness. All I could say the entire time we were eating was \"wow\"! Very clean restaurant, very nice and polite staff. I highly, highly recommend checking out this local spot for some fantastic food!"}
{"text":"This is by far my favorite place for Indian food. The guy on the phone is always so pleasant. One time I got chana masala which comes with rice, veggie biryani, and 2 somosas all for $22! That's a steal. When I got that same thing at different place it cost $30 and wasn't even nearly as delicious as their food. The veggie biryani was good. Not amazing but good to where I would get it once in a while. The Chana masala is A-FREAKIN-MAZING!! The minute you taste it, there's holi festival going on in your mouth. It just hits you with all the right flavors and perfect consistency. The white rice that it comes with is perfect. The somosas are good too. But that Chana masala! Oyyyyy! My mouth is watering as I write about it because it's THAT good.   Go here, people. You won't regret it!"}
{"text":"The restaurant is very tranquil. We came in and had dinner. My Aloo Gobi was delicious. The jasmine rice was seasoned well. My boyfriend ordered shrimp vindaloo spicy and the sauce was bright and hot. His shrimp were large, and the portions were a good size. Order the pakoras, their chutney is outstanding. The butter naan was light and fresh. The staff was friendly and attentive. Will come back."}
{"text":"Super fast delivery thanks to GrubHub. Fantastic flavors! Hubby's a little disappointed in the Naan, but it could be a delivery thing.. we're already done eating 4 minutes before our estimated delivery time. Yum. Glad we found this place."}
{"text":"Sunday afternoon lunch - was excellent! I'm just sorry I haven't tried this place before. We will definitely be returning. Large portions gave us plenty to take home. Chicken was tender in all out dishes. Lovely dining room and prompt service. Excellent all around."}
{"text":"I really enjoyed this place and was entirely glad that we came here for dinner. My first impression of the ambiance was that it could definitely use some sprucing up. Maybe add a little more wall art, add a little music. There was one person hosting, taking orders, and delivering food - when we walked in, we weren't greeted so we just took a seat and helped ourselves to some menus. Wasn't a big deal as new restaurants needs some time to work out the kinks and such.   Onto the food - had the samosa, palak paneer, and the malai kofta - and of course w/ some naan and rice. We were also able to adjust spice level - always a nice option as some Indian places I've been to make their palak paneer much too spicy. We got medium for both and it was perfect for someone that likes spice but still want to feel their lips after they eat. The palak was pretty good - paneer was clearly fresh, perfect consistency. I wasn't too impressed with the flavor, but like I said, it was still pretty good. As for the kofta - we couldn't stop raving about it. It was such a beautiful blend of flavors and textures. I'm not sure we can visit this place again without getting it again! Naan and rice were perfect. Samosa was also very, very good. The sauces that came with it were also well made. My girlfriend doesn't usually like the sauces, but she really enjoyed the ones we had tonight.   Our server was very friendly and attentive. They also had a large selection of vegetarian dishes. This place has great potential to be a 5 star in my books - maybe it will be the next time I visit!"}
{"text":"I went for lunch (Special $8.99) and it was delicious. I had the Paneer(Vegetarian) Tikka Masala and it was really good. I ordered it with Medium heat and it could've been spicier but hey, I ordered medium! Was a great portion size and I had some left over. The gentleman that helped me was very informative and patient with my questions too. Very nice.  Loved that I got to try a few different things with my order, that was the best part. Will definitely be back."}
{"text":"What a wonderful place to come for Indian food!  Fresh, tasty, and spiced to your individual preference. Just had lunch there and was delighted to have freshly prepared samosa, not dried out from being in a steam table like the buffets, wonderful sauce and chutney came with it, and a vegetable korma that was just the right amount of spicy for me (I ordered medium).  I love the garlic naan here too.  We have had several different items on the menu and we have been so pleased with all of them.  Peter, our host most of the time, helps me when I want to try something different, and I am always delighted with his recommendations.  If you want freshly made, excellent Indian food, this is the place to go!  And the prices are so reasonable.  Treat yourself to a lunch for a try and I am sure you will be back again and again."}
{"text":"I wenr for dinner tonight. I frequently go to Indian restaurants so am very familar with the food. We ordered Goat curry and chicken tikka masala. The goat curry had 60-70 % fat and bones. Will highly recommend to avoid this place."}
{"text":"Had lunch here the other day. Very friendly and very clean on the inside. Food was actually really good I was impressed. Only reason for the 4 star and not 5 is because I've had better."}
{"text":"Great food and Service.  Can wait to go back soon.  I have already told several friends how good this place is, makes me hungry just thinking about it."}
{"text":"We have always ordered takeout so can't speak about service. Food is consistently good. Chicken tikka masala is spicy and flavorful with nice white chicken breast chunks. Samosas are delicious as is everything else we've ordered but can't remember names. Sorry. Very good place for reliable tasty Indian food. Some day we'll dine in."}
{"text":"Only way this could have been better is if they served alcohol. Our server was very helpful considering I was completely uncertain of what was on the menu. They could have had some description but didn't. Very nice and spicy shrimp dish with whatever amount of heat you desire. I got the extra hot version and it was a tomato based dish. Excellent. Rice was perfect too!  I definitely will return and try other menu items. Very fun to eat cuisine you are unfamiliar with and have it be great. Good job Mantra. Nice and clean too."}
{"text":"All I can say is, Wow!!  Came for an early dinner on a Sunday and we left happy and full!  We started with samosas and they were absolutely delicious. I had a mango Lassi (basically a mango milkshake) and my husband had a Indian masala tea (tea with milk) both were also great. For entrees we took the recommendation from other reviews and the server and got the Kafta and shrimp Tikka Masala with garlic Naan.  The shrimp was wonderful- very fresh tasting (I can be a bit picky if it tastes fishy).  Everything came out exactly as ordered and was AMAZING!!  Will definitely be one of our regular places."}
{"text":"My favorite Indian place on this side of town.  I really enjoy their Malai kofta and think it's the best in the valley. I've also liked all of the paneer based dishes I've tried so far. Don't let the early 90's shopping center area exterior fool you. This place is great and worth a try!"}
{"text":"Given the great reviews, I was very surprised by the tasteless food I had from Mantra. I had a takeout order of chicken biryani, chicken saag, garlic naan, and kheer. Everything was so bland to me. Though there was a hint of spice, the food didn't have the complex mix of flavors you expect from Indian food. The rice was also awful. It tasted like long grain white rice that would be served in a bad college dorm cafeteria - it wasn't the usual fragrant basmati rice and it was hard too.   There was plenty of tender chicken in the saag and biryani but again, it was somewhat tasteless and the biryani wasn't very flavorful. The kheer was a sickly sweet soup with that same awful hard rice and had the consistency of syrup. The naan was probably the only decent part of the entire order. Two stars since the food didn't make us sick but it didn't taste good at all."}
{"text":"Very good service in very clean restaurant. Loved the garlic naan with several of the awesome curry dishes. Will definitely be going back for that!"}
{"text":"I ended up stumbling on this place the other day during lunch. We went to go to the Thai place that was there, but apparently they moved across the street. At the time I didn't know that. We did see this place, and decided to go into avoid wandering around looking for a place for lunch.   The only complaint I have, is that when we walked in it was very dark, and no customers were in there, and the gentleman working was not very inviting. To clarify: He wasn't mean or anything, we just couldn't even tell if the place was open or not, and being actively warm, friendly, and inviting would be recommended, as it was confusing to determine whether this empty restaurant was under construction or what was going on in there. I am not a very friendly guy, so I don't like doing the duty of breaking the ice, however I had to do it in this case.  After we figured out the place was open for business, we sat down to eat. We looked at the menu, and the it seemed like you got a lot for the lunch specials for the price. I ordered the butter chicken hot, and my coworker ordered the lamb vindaloo. The gentleman working there made it seem like going hot would be a dangerous choice, but I said OK I'll live with it.  The lunch specials were $10, and after we picked and ordered, it didn't seem like it took that long to come out. Well maybe now that I'm thinking about it, it did considering there was no one in the restaurant other than us. So the food came out and I was very happy with the portions and the assortment that was on the plate.  There was what I believe to be a samosa, one of those little cheese dessert balls soaked in syrup, a generous portion of butter chicken, jasmine rice, I believe there was a Tamrind sauce, and a mint chutney I think.  The butter chicken was delicious, however, if you're with company that wants a really hot spicy food, the hot they gave me was not that hot at all. That being said I'm glad because it tasted good, but I could see somebody being disappointed that really enjoys hot food.  another great thing about this place is they gave us a very generous helping of garlic naan. I loved it and unlike another review, there was no sand or whatever in mine. It was top notch Naan.  There was not too much service to be had, but there was not too much service that was needed. The food was good, the pricing seemed reasonable, and I was happy. I would recommend this place.  The ambience (empty, dim, old furniture and decoration style) leaves a little bit to be desired, but maybe they'll become busier and it will seem nicer with people there. The only way I would take a chick on a dinner date here is if I wanted to find out if she was high maintenance or not. If your chick is chill, or you just want to do casual lunch or are you going to do take out this is definitely a great place to go."}
{"text":"I went here the other day and the food is delicious I got the traditional mild curry and (I might up the spice factor on my next visit)  it was delicious! My friend got the Marsala which was even BETTER I just might get that next time! The waiter was very nice and talkative I really enjoyed myself."}
{"text":"I came here with a friend and it was excellent! I have been to other places in the area which I did not like and have not gone back to but this place was fast, friendly, and tasty! We got Garlic Nan, which was perfectly made and full of fresh garlic. We also got the Chettinadu Curry and Goan Vindaloo which we asked for spicy and got actual spice! They also tasted great and flavorful. I am anxious to try some other dishes they have soon!"}
{"text":"Wonderful little restaurant! I came in for lunch and figured i'd have something simple, Chicken Tikka Masala, very good! I ordered it mild and it wasn't hot/spicy at all.   Samosa was tender and delicious, with delicious chutney.  Naan bread was excellent, and the rice was fresh and fragrant, maybe a hint of cardamom? I'm a fan.   Lunch even came with a gulab jamun, my fav, which was very light and refreshing, not super dense like they sometimes are.   It was quite a bit of food for the price and every bit of it was fantastic!   The gentleman who runs the place was a gracious host, and the decor is simple and lovely.   I will definitely be back to try more, I noticed they had \"Gobi Manchurian\", a chinese-indian cauliflower dish that I particularly like.   A very welcome addition to the neighborhood and a pleasure all around!"}
{"text":"I'm definitely a regular now. I'm hooked. I still need to try different dishes, but so far it's the butter chicken, chicken tikka masala or rogan josh. All great! Buttered naan is so good! Will continue to do take out or use Grubhub."}
{"text":"Ate here today for lunch. The food was very good but I am only giving it 4 stars because of a couple of things. The thing that bothered me about this place was they had table cloths with glass over it. The table had 2 menus under the glass facing opposite directions and centered in the middle of the table so you had to lean over to read it. The part of the table cloth that was not covered by the glass was filthy. Drips of food as well as food sort of jammed under the edge of the glass. The restroom was not clean either.  The food was very good, good size portions and very good garlic naan.  Server was polite and attentive.  They need to get rid the table cloth action. It was gross and really sad that the majority of my review was about that rather than how tastey the food was."}
