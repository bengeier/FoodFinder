{"text":"Great food, fantastic service!  My co-workers and I have made the QV our go-to pub for lunch. The daily specials are always excellent and our server Mariya is a Saint. She will go to any length to make sure we happy and content.  Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"I came here for a work event and really enjoyed my meal. It was a set menu so maybe not their usual stuff, but very good nonetheless. I had the roast beef with mashed potatoes. Roast beef was very juicy, maybe a bit too much gravy but I didn't mind, and the mashed potatoes were nice and creamy. Also had horseradish on the side which was good too. The other dishes were a salmon with rice and veggies and pretty standard chicken fingers and fries, both looked pretty good as well. I'd definitely come back here to try their regular menu sometime."}
{"text":"I like coming here for a quick bite and some beer with friends during the week. I usually have their fish and chips, but they have daily specials that can be pretty good as well.   I'm not sure why all the hate on the waitresses?- but they're very friendly. Both they, and the owner always recognize the regulars/locals and treat us well. When I say regulars, I mean I come in sometimes once a month and they still remember me. On more than one occasion I've gotten a free drink or two when he recognizes me and my friend.   Friday and Saturday nights usually have a 'one-man band' type of entertainment. He plays the saxophone along to calypso, reggae, soca, and top 40. He also deejays. It's an older crowd (I would say 40+), but still enjoyable because no one bothers us.  Nice alternative to the regular restaurant/bars around the Scarborough Town Centre area when you don't want the bustle of those places."}
{"text":"Finding an English Pub in this part of Scarborough is challenging. Even if you drive-by once-in-a-while, you'll easily miss out on this. Out of sight and somewhat in an non-commercial more industrial land. Queen V is that Needle in your Haystack, but not much Hay in 'boro. You get what I mean. You search a pub to get drunk. Not to rationalize.  Plenty of regulars come to enjoy a patio setup and inside isn't shabby. Enjoy LCD for your visual pleasure as the waitress are less enticing. Nothing fancy schmancy, just your typical commercialized drafts. Lots of daily specials as most pubs would do routinely.    2.5'd  Tuesday $1/2 ribs for a rack with fries($11.00). Fall-off-bone when I breath on it. A definite local spot for the individuals/groups alike that are tired of the following: Wild Wings.  Boston Pizza.  Jack Astors.  Again I say.. You get what I mean."}
{"text":"Mariya is my soul mate and go to person for recommendations in life.  Also the food and drinks are great here.  Greg likes this place cause there is alcohol.  2 thumbs up!"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I always find ourself at this pub. It's amazing here. The service is okay and the food always comes so fast! Beer selection is the best! Nothing bad to say about queen Vic"}
{"text":"This place is an absolute gem. I had the wings and Sheppard's pie and both were awesome. The service was also great. Wish I had something like this back home. I know if I lived in Toronto this would be a go to."}
{"text":"I like this place with its decoration. Delicious fish and chip i must say, and the kidney steak pie is awesome"}
{"text":"The food isn't great but there is an alight draft selection and the venue is reliable for always having the game you need on. Patio size is great and not overwhelmingly loud."}
{"text":"The food  at this place is TERRIBLE!! I ordered the butter chicken breast  thinking it was a chicken breast cooked in covered with butter but it was not. It came out in a bowl smothered in a terrible orange sauce. My coworker ordered a burger medium rare and its came out well done and dry is the desert. I've been ordered the filet bass and it came out under cook and very jelly like with a terrible taste. Overall 1 out of the 4 meals was edible. But they had cheap beer and it was cold."}
{"text":"A OK or I've experienced better? 2.5 star maybe  Queen Victoria Pub can be both...  Great to have a drink with a friend if you are in Scarborough area.... but why are you in Scarborough in the first place?  Waitresses are really friendly.. and homey... most of the patrons are from the area.  Over 20 drafts on taps... nothing too exotic but most people will find something they enjoy.  Food.... Tuesday night is 1/2 half ribs... $11 for a rack with fries..lucky it is half price, as it just tasted blend and on the dry side and lack that grilled taste... BBQ sauce not helping much in making it taste any better...  Maybe I would stick with a beer and watch the Blue Jays lose/win next time on one of the big screen TV...  Dimming the light a little might help... at least all of us includes the waitresses can looks better? :)"}
{"text":"Came here to get drinks and watch the game with my boyfriend. Upon arrival, no one was to be found. However, we walked over to the bar and we were able to sit anywhere we wanted to.  This place is really nice for a pub. Definitely much cleaner than other pubs in the area.  Our waitress was kind, however the service was slow! The pub was pretty empty, only like 3 tables were occupied but she hardly checked up on us. Probably only once, because she went to give food to a table near us.  I probably would be back if I'm in the area for drinks and possibly try their food!"}
{"text":"I went on a Friday. It's a biggish space, and the music was good enough dancehall/soca/oldies .. but it was more of an older crowd. Mostly women too. There was no cover charge, and things kept kicking til maybe 3am. I expect I'll be back."}
