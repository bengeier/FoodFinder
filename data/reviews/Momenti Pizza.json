{"text":"Ive been here twice.  The first time we found the pizza to be too thin in terms of the amount of toppings.  I was not impress with the time i had to wait to order my pizza.  No one was behind the counter.  My second time there was when I decided not to return.  The kid behind the counter was preparing a pizza for someone when I approached the counter to order mine.  He immediately began to take my order.  I paid cash.  He wore no gloves, handled the money, and then returned back to the pizza he was preparing.  He did not wash his hands or put on a pair of gloves.  The owners of this restaurant need to teach these kids about food handling and hygiene.  For a  restaurant  that is suffering for business, they are very careless.  I will go back for the yogurt, but I will never buy pizza there again.  Someone handling food should not handle the cash at the same time.  I gave this one star, but it doesnt deserve it."}
{"text":"Great fresh pizza!  Finally something other than chain garbage... or an expensive pizza that is a gamble ever time you order it....

Great quality ingredients that are fresh.  Crust is fresh as well :)  they offer pesto too :)

You would think they should be in Tempe or Old Town Scottsdale with the other great restraunts!

Best $8 u can spend!"}
{"text":"Had high hopes for this place considering its within walking distance of our house.  A freschetta would have been a better pizza.  Low quality toppings, and premade crusts.  For the same price, you can get much better at somewhere like Sauce.  Even Little Caesars would be a better option."}
{"text":"Very good pizza, cool concept with the frozen yogurt place in the same building. Clean restaurant and very friendly staff. It's right near my house so I will for sure be back."}
{"text":"I should have gone to Mod.  Seriously skimpy on toppings and it's not even that good.  I got onion and pepperoni with extra cheese and there are like 10 tiny pieces of onion and maybe 12 slices of pepperoni on this \"pizza.\"  Awful...I have zero clue why people are raving about this place!!"}
{"text":"We wanted to give the new pizza place a try and were not throughly impressed. The pizza crust itself is not bad, but the toppings were very slim. The sauce tastes like it came out of a can. 

They only have one pizza maker and it is the kind that you put on a belt and run through to cook it. The actual restaurant was not very clean and they had no highs hair or changing station in the bathrooms. 

Glad we tried, but won't be going back."}
{"text":"The pizza is premade and cooked in like a microwave oven thing. It was not good. Sorry."}
{"text":"All I had was $9 so I looked for anything but fast food. I found this place and it was perfect. Good service, and really good pizza. Idk why there is any bad reviews because it exceeded my expectations. I guess Zoyo and Momenti are the same and i think they have a great thing going here. Pizza and yogurt? What could be a better start and finish?"}
{"text":"Omg! This tiny pizzeria is connected to a Froyo shop! The pizza is delicious and not too expensive. The employees are so nice. No long wait. The decor is adorable and who can beat a pizzeria connected to a froyo place?!? 
It's a small pizzeria, so if there's a lot of people it can get cramped. Totally worth it!"}
{"text":"Only eaten here once so far but enjoyed it. The only thing I'd change is to ask them to cook longer so the bottom of the crust is crispier. 

Saw people complaining about the toppings. For the price point I think it's fine. These pizzas aren't expensive. And someone like me doesn't like having so many toppings I can't see the cheese. 

I'd recommend this place to others."}
{"text":"The pizza here is delicious, would definitely recommend to anyone in the area. To top it off they're even connected to a froyo place! Yum! The sauce and cheese tastes superb and the crust is seasoned to my liking. Definitely going to be going back! The decor is also very quaint and cozy."}
{"text":"Not really impressed with this place unfortunately. My boyfriend and I happened upon it while getting some coffee at the Dunkin Donuts next door. We were craving pizza and gave this place a try. Its sorta like a fired pie/ chipotle concept restaurant but with more restrictions and less options. We got the sausage and peppers pizza and substituted the onions for mushrooms. Pluses, the pizza was hot and the cheese made that iconic stretching from pizza to mouth. Minuses, lacking in flavor and toppings and over no wow factor."}
{"text":"I agree with the first reviewer. Pizza is way overpriced and mediocre. Frozen store bought is honestly better than this pizza. I spent close to $15 for a gluten free cheese and it was made from the same frozen gluten free udi's  pizza crust that I can buy at Walmart. Not impressed. This place will be out of business in less than a year."}
