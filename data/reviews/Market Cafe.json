{"text":"$19 and change is way too much for a breakfast buffet.  Especially when the scrambled eggs were runny, the french toast was as hard as a rock, bacon and sausage were under cooked and the gravy for the biscuits was flavorless.

The service left a lot to be desired as well.  The waitress was a robot.  Since we were part of a large group we were hit with an 18% gratuity charge even though we paid on separate checks.  For that huge fee we got our drink orders taken care of and our checks.  The waitress was absent for most of the time we were there.  The only friendliness from the staff was when we were leaving.

Never again!  It's not worth it at all.  We were there on 3/29/15.."}
{"text":"Unbelievable atmosphere! Water falls, views, ponds, and scenery all around you as you enjoy there food! I highly recommend the breakfast buffet! We love it and love taking guest here from out of town."}
{"text":"Ate the breakfast buffet 2 mornings.  Food and service was very good.  Would definitely go back."}
{"text":"The food is always good here but it will be a TWO HOUR meal by the time we get out of here. Unacceptable!  I think they have to go to another Marriott somewhere to get our f-ing food. Ugh!!"}
{"text":"The atmosphere in the restaurant was amazing. There were beautiful waterfalls and the lobby was gorgeous. Although the waiter mixed up the drinks, he was very kind and considerate. The menu was smaller than most places, but all the options looked delicious. Everything we ordered was flavorful and satisfying. I highly suggest this restaurant."}
{"text":"Worst service I've had in years. Our waitress disappeared for 30 minutes while our food got cold waiting for her to serve it. Then she had the nerve to add the 18% tip because we were a party of 7. Even though we were staying at the hotel and it is convenient, we will definitely not be going back."}
{"text":"Great Breakfast Buffet!  Kudos to Chef Kevin!  The only reason there are not 5 stars are because the service was a bit too slow. At lunch we were in a hurry trying to check out and catch a plane and I had to track down the server, but, other than that, great food and lovely setting!  Do not miss the breakfast buffet!"}
{"text":"Great breakfast buffet here. Wide range of breakfast foods; Southwest scramble was very tasty (eggs w/ chorizo). Food was good and reasonably priced for buffet style ($20 per person). The best part of this place was the gorgeous view! Definitely sit on the patio to have an awesome view of the Marriott pool and surrounding scenery. Pretty waterfall inside the cafe as well."}
{"text":"Had Easter brunch for the third year in a row here. It's the only holiday we eat out. We've thought about trying something new but this place is worth coming back to again and again. The staff are  so so great. The are personable and so accommodating. My omelet was delish as well as the prime rib!! But the guys serving it even better."}
{"text":"The Market Cafe offers great food and presentation, with friendly staff. For lunch, I had a cob grilled shrimp salad, that was delicious, however the shrimp was a bit on the salty side.
Tentative and prompt service, fresh food selection, and a fun place to eat at the resort."}
{"text":"Excellent breakfast buffet. Wait staff was very attentive. Waiter was waiting with the omelette chef with chiriso sausage for a made to order omelet.

Lunch, wait staff is the star again. Made us all feel special. The sandwiches were nothing special but fine ingredients and presentation.

The hotel itself is a diamond in the rough, Marriott has done it right.
We'll be back!"}
{"text":"Absolutely wonderful. I went for the breakfast buffet and the food was really good. Best coffee I have ever had. Amazing views and the service was awesome. I loved it and will be going back. Do yourself this favor, you won't regret it. Yes it a little pricey but it is worth the money."}
{"text":"Very beautiful view from the dinning patio with waterfall and different kinds of wild flowers. Open from 6am-11am for breakfast. They have buffet and off the menu breakfast. The orange blueberry pancake is a must. They also brew Starbucks coffee!"}
{"text":"So the appetizers were good, we started with the Burrata Caprese and Mediterranean hummus which was really good, but then our dinner came. My husband got the Ribeye and it was dry as a bone. I got the burger which was also super dry. We waited for 20 minutes just to get asked for a drink order. My husband wasn't given a fork and knife to eat his dry steak either. I will say they staff was great, they comped most of our meals and alcohol because of how long it took."}
{"text":"I hold this little gem near and dear to my heart. My husband and I first dined here on our anniversary, when we were both students and could afford little more than a glass of lemonade. But just being in the elegant Buttes Marriot Hotel, surrounded by Beautiful People, and waited on by the attentive staff made us feel, well, *rich*. 

The Market Cafe serves sandwiches, chicken, and a variety of California-style menu items. And while the menu may not be terribly inspired, the setting surely is. Call ahead and ask for a table by the 30-foot-tall indoor waterfall and fish pond. The last time we dined at the Cafe, we splurged and had the dinner buffet --- wonderful!"}
{"text":"BACKGROUND 

I've been looking online for the last hour trying to find a menu for Market Café at the Buttes. 

All I can find on the Marriott Buttes website is information regarding their flagship restaurant, Top of the Rock.

So, that's annoying and perhaps should be fixed.

Anyway, the review...

MARKET CAFÉ

The Market Café has an impressive environment inside with the massive indoor waterfall and the view from the dining room is spectacular. 

Although they serve breakfast and lunch, the real deal is the all-you-can-eat breakfast buffet. 

Unfortunately, the breakfast buffet lacks the splendor the environment/ view has. The buffet is good, but not great. 

The buffet has all of the usual breakfast items:
eggs, French toast, cereals, muffins, bagels, fruits, sausage, bacon and the price is very reasonable.

They also serve mimosas, which always makes me very happy. 

SERVICE EXPERIENCE 

The staff was extremely helpful. In fact, our table had 4-5 servers making sure we had everything we needed.

CONCLUSION 

Overall, I 4/5 highly recommend the Market Café."}
{"text":"very simple breakfast. we went in for valentine's breakfast, there were 6 of us.  We were quickly seated and our server was super great.

The food was in a little hallway section, they had an omelet bar made to order.  Everything else was buffet: scrambled eggs, bacon (no sausage), French toast, chilaquiles, oatmeal and some fixings, yogurt and some fixings (no granola) fruit, cereal/milk and bread.  This was a gift to us, but if I were paying I would have chosen a different place.

Everything was decent as it should be for these basic breakfast items.  The location is nice.  Inside the dining room they had a little waterfall or some type of water feature, our kids didn't really go look, but there were other kids near it.

Towards the end of our meal, the servers or manager or whoever was in charge, starting moving tables around.  They had a very large group to seat so they started Dragging tables and chairs near us which made everything very noisy and ruined our conversation since we couldn't hear each other.  They should've picked up the tables/chairs instead of dragging them and pushing them from one side of the room to the other.  Very bad."}
{"text":"Breakfast buffet is $20 and NOT worth it!!!  Are you kidding me?  Nothing is very hot, few choices and eggs were wet and runny.  I stayed at the hotel and didn't even look at the menu since a buffet is quick, easy and since I am doing low carb, I could choose my own. My mistake!  No way this food is worth that."}
{"text":"Nice place. I ate breakfast here this week.  The meals are good and the buffet is very nice with more than the normal options like Eggs Benedict, Egg Blintz and more.  A little on the expensive side, but good service."}
{"text":"Do NOT get the Butte Fried Pork Sandwich.  I've always loved the view and the food was quite good, but today, this sandwich was awful.  This experience will keep me away for a while.  The fried pork 'patty' looked like something from McDonald's.  It simply does not below at this restaurant.  The view and staff are still great, but WOW, what a terrible sandwich this was.  Plus it was $17.  Grrr..."}
{"text":"Oh my gosh the black bean sweet potato burger is amazing. Great food guys. Also, great ambiance! We loved the tacos too."}
{"text":"Seafood breakfast ... rare in Arizona but the market café had the perfect omelet to satisfy the seafood craving.  The crabby phoenix - omelet with jalpeno cream cheese, crab and pico de gallo was delicious !!! big chunks of crab in each bite and the pico de gallo gave this dish a great refreashing note to it. We decied to sit outside,  the view is overlooking the hotel and pool area. very beautifula and relaxing. its a perfect way to start the day."}
{"text":"The breakfast was ok and also the service. 
Nothing that can justify the $42 bill we got for a simple breakfast for two!!
Nothing fancy just eggs and hash browns and orange juice and the breakfast plate ... 
The place is nice but totally not worth it."}
{"text":"We ate breakfast here both mornings we stayed here. We love breakfast and the buffet is very good. You can have omelets fresh made to order. Lots and lots of breakfast options. The biscuits and gravy were very very good. The coffee was a bit bitter. But over all good food and beautiful scenery to look at with my  hubby over breakfast."}
