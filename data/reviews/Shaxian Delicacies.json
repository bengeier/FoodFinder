{"text":"I like this restaurant. The price is reasonable and noodles taste good. But I don't like wontons here. The soup here pretty good. Recommend to try."}
{"text":"Small restaurant that I wouldn't have come in if it wasn't for my friends' choice. Surprisingly this little restaurant is a hidden gem! Apparently it was well known back in China, Beijing and other places.   I had their individual for one person soup (tea tree mushroom with duck and mandarin peel- good for coughs *i had some for past two days*). Sharing we had ShaXian wonton, ShaXian vermicelli with pork, steamed cabbage dumplings, wok fried spare ribs in wine sauce.   Their shaxian wontons $3.49 for 16 of them yet they're small like a nickle size (smaller than a quarter) but the meat is sooooo flavorful and tender. Wonton wrap was very silky smooth and the clear soup base was just the right taste. Not too savory and it was really tasty. (I was kind of shocked to be honest).    The ShaXian vermicelli with pork was sooooo good, light and fluffy but not greasy! Simple dish, stir fired with some egg, some onions and pork slices. For $7.99 I think it is definitely worth it because I like stir fried vermicelli but really afraid to be greasy, heavy and filling with carbs.   Steamed cabbage dumplings- 4/5* for the taste of the meat, but the dumplings doesn't have juice coming out, yet it isn't dry. But I still prefer the wonton soup more. $4.99 for 8 pieces  I had tea tree mushroom with duck and mandarin orange peel soup. It was traditional style but still too tasty for natural homemade (for sure there's MSG). But so far 2 hrs after dinner I'm not thirsty or having dry mouth.   I love this place and will definitely come back for more soon."}
{"text":"Some of the food taste good looks like wonton, some of the food taste not very well looks like the bun. Just depend by what you order in their."}
{"text":"Dropped by for lunch today, it's not been open for long.  The name of the restaurant is a place in Fujian.  So my fellow Fujinese diners informed me.  They serve steamed/fried dumplings, soup dumplings, cold appetizers, soup noodles, noodles and they have individual steamed soups.  Lots of people ordered the soups but we didn't try any.  They were around $7 for each individual clay pot.  We ordered the Sha Xian wontons, steamed pork and celery dumplings, Fujian stuffed fish balls, marinated tofu and a free range chicken noodle soup.  The foods were all nice, nothing really great but ok.  The soup they used for the wontons,noodles and Fujian fish balls was pretty plain, and seemed like just water and chicken powder.  With the soup noodles you can choose from around 4/5 different noodle types.  They also have a lot of different rice combos too.  Lots of other diners got the peanut sauce noodles, they smelled really appetizing, even though I'm not a big peanut fan.  I would try them, if I came back here.  The 2 servers were nice and polite too."}
{"text":"Shaxian is a relatively new restaurant that serves extremely affordable Fujian dishes. Ordered a total of 4 items: the extremely popular noodles in peanut sauce, pork and chive wontons, chicken dumplings and pork/leek/mushroom baos. The restaurant was busy but food was served extremely quickly. +5 for the noodles in peanut sauce because it was cheap and delicious. Everything else was pretty standard. Nothing to really write home about but I definitely appreciate spending under $20 for all that food.   https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shaxian_delicacies I wonder if this is a franchise business or just the official logo for shaxian cuisine?  3.5 for not breaking the bank."}
{"text":"Summary: slotted in the busy Midland/Silverstar plaza, Sha Xian caters to the meat loving, sauce relishing, and bun munching crowd but it has barely any vegetarian options and the dishes were either bland or super heavy to me... honestly, it's a bit overrated right now.  What I Tried 201 Sha Xian Style Stir Fried Pork and Lychee 13 Steamed Mushroom Bun  What I Liked: Mushroom Bun  What I'll Get Next Time: another bun, business combo 233 or 235, and bring a meat eating friend Also, the wonton is supposed to be good!   I was excited to try this because Dumpling King reigns supreme in this plaza and I've been consistently trying to convince myself to try something else there: enter Sha Xian.  The outside of the restaurant is in Chinese characters and we weren't positive we were in the right place until we walked in (I should've taken a picture!). Red colour theme, decor is bright yet simple, and it looks to be a simple and clean environment. They get bonus points here for playing Backstreet Boys as their background music.  I got the 201 fried pork and Lychee dish, thinking it'd be a funky combination. It was, but it didn't quite work for me. Not tender. Very punchy and saucy but I didn't love the taste. Lychee was hardened from being fried. Didn't mesh as well as I imagined.  I was really looking forward to trying their buns but they put meat in ALL their appetizers. As a vegetarian option, we had the choice of peanut sauce noodles for nearly $3, so that was a hard pass. The mushroom buns were actually quite tasty, although the portion size was disappointing.  My friend's seafood noodles: I think I could've made the same thing. Noodles didn't seem fresh, and portion size was disappointing. For that price point, might as well go to a Make Your Own Noodle Bowl place.  Underwhelming experience that might have to do with picking the wrong order. If I'm back, I'll have to try something else."}

{"text":"Tried this place out as they opened recently. Seats about 30 people, and has fairly modern decor. It wasn't busy at 8pm on a Saturday Night. The menu consists of varieties of dumplings (Steamed and Fried), Noodles as well as Combo Rice dishes. We ordered the Small Pork Wontons (16?) for $2.99, which were very bland and tasteless. In my opinion, the packaged ones you can buy at the grocery store taste better. We also got the Noodles in Peanut Sauce (3/5), which was decent, but came in a very small portion. The Pork Intestine and Vermicelli Noodle Soup was very disappointing, as the soup base was bland and the Pork intestines were very fatty. Overall there was nothing special about at all, and for $8.99, the portion was very small. We got the Fried Dumplings as we were still hungry and again nothing special, as it tasted bland and are literally like the ones you can buy at be grocery store. (There was also a long strand of hair attached to one of these). The hot lemon water they serve tasted funky, possibly due to the reusing of the lemons. The servers were quick to collect our plates, but didn't really seem happy to be there at all. I would not recommend at all, unless you just want a quick bite."}
{"text":"We ordered the wonton and I didn't like the stuffing coz it tasted and looked like artificial meat mixed with many unhealthy ingredients even though the price is very nice. Also had steamed bun which was ok but I think it's the same frozen bun we can buy from supermarket. The most expensive dish was the pork intestine. It was also ok. Anyway we won't go back. I'd rather spend a bit more $ for better quality food."}
{"text":"Went to this restaurant based on reviews from Yelp. Ordered Thick noodle in peanut sauce, chive and pork deep fried dumpling, Shaxian wonton and Pork ribs in wine sauce.   Thick noodle in peanut sauce $2.49.  Peanut sauce didn't have much peanut flavour.  Noodles is Lai Fun.    Chive and pork deep fried dumpling $5.49 8 pieces.  Not the regular dumplings that you may be use to.  There is more meat than chive, reminds me of meatball.  I can taste some spice seasoning, kind of like five spice.  Shaxian wonton $3.49 16 pieces.  Mini wonton with soup. Not much pork flavour.  Reminds me of pork balls wrapped in wonton wrapper.  Filling is light and bouncy just like pork balls.  These wontons are one biters.  Pork ribs in wine sauce $9.99. This was the worst dish out of the four.  The ribs are pre fried and when a customer orders they refry and add the sauce.  The meat was dry and hard.  80% of the pork ribs was bone, cartilage and batter.  Really no meat, should have called it cartilage in wine sauce. I know the sauce is suppose to be vinegar base, but it was extremely strong.  You can see chilli flakes and minced raw garlic but I could not taste it... that's how strong th vinegar was.  Maybe Shaxian food is not my taste. The flavour is one note, I see other components in the dish but I don't taste it.  The quality of the pork ribs was really bad.  Nothing I ate there made me want to go back."}
{"text":"Good portions.  Very affordable.  I actually went to this franchise quite a bit back in Beijing.  Glad to see it here.  Food is good.  Love this place.  Love the soup, wontons, fried pork ribs, dumplings, just yum yum yum.  Come try it!  It's fairly new and even though the pricing of the food is quite cheap you still get good service, clean environment, lemon water vs just tap water, clean washroom.  I'm impressed."}
{"text":"The soup here is really good and isn't pounded with msg. The wontons here are always a must !!  Combine that with any of their noodle soups or peanut noodles and you'll be filled up.  Good prices and pretty good quality food !!"}
{"text":"Every table ordered a soup and I suggest you should too! The double boiled soup ?? is aromatic and supposed to be health benefits too. There are a quite a few to choose from depends of your body condition!  You can order the soup alone or add wontons to the soup ($1 extra or so for 8). I personally didn't enjoy the filling of these pork wontons at all. They have this funky texture I didn't like: a bland tasting ball of bounciness.  Noodle in Peanut Sauce ($2.79) is as a good carb filler. Light with sourness and just a hint of peanut.  I would be back for more soup and might try other Fijian delicacy on the menu.  Service is fast and good for a quick bite. The interior is modern and well kept but I hope you like the Flashy Red decor theme."}
{"text":"This place has surprisingly a lot of cheap eats.  Peanut sauce noodles is only 2.79!  They also have 16 deep fried wontons for 3.49$ - crazy! The deep fried buns were a good deal too. We tried their pork and chives steamed dumplings (which they left out from our order, we had to reorder it) and it was not good. The dumpling skin was thick and the pork filling was dry.  We also got the chicken pot and it was filled with bones and the sauce was slightly sour yet salty but it looked as if it's suppose to be spicy- but it isn't. We also go the stir fry clams and they did not taste stir fried. They tasted boiled and then they added a red sauce on top which looked very red and spicy but was actually sour and weird tasting as well. My favourite dish was the deep fried salt and pepper tofu- crispy, lightly flavored"}
