{"text":"Go for the Soup Dumplings. We stopped for a quick lunch before going to a matinee show. After hearing so much raving about the soup dumplings here, we had to make sure we tried them on a quick visit to the area.   We ordered both the pork soup dumplings. I understand they are made to order, so I wasn't surprised that it took a good 15 minutes for them to be served even though the restaurant was not busy at this hour. I was surprised at how large the dumplings were. I understand that some people say the proper method of eating them is to bite or puncture the dumpling so that the soup drains into your spoon. But since I'm accustomed to slightly smaller dumplings I like to put the whole dumpling into my mouth and feel the release of the soup in my mouth as the dumpling bursts. That way I experience the full flavor of the soup along with the filling.  It was not an easy chore to get a whole dumpling into my mouth. It was impossible for my wife to do so. Letting the dumplings cool considerably was the key to not burning my mouth. By the time we finished the half dozen pork dumplings, it was a lot easier to deal with the cooler, remaining 6 crab dumplings.  The soup flavor of the pork dumplings was simply outstanding. So much flavor!!! The crab dumplings had a lot of crab/fish flavor, but our favorite was the pork."}
{"text":"Oh CTB...where shall I start?  We've been through a lot in the past few years.    I still remember when I first found you, a small underground treasure that served the most delicious Northern Chinese street/comfort food.  You felt like \"home\" when Ness Y. and I would share a big bowl of hand-pulled noodles and dumplings after strolls around downtown and talks of race, equity, politics and boys.  At first, I guarded you.  Only my closest friends got to meet you, and they were warned, \"you'll probably end up sitting on the toilet all night but don't worry, totally worth it and only happens the first time...consider this an initiation\".  When my dating got serious, you would vet the boyfriends and their level of spice tolerance - many did not make the cut.  You were there when my then-boyfriend pulled out a ring and proposed, I nearly choked on a mouthful of crispy spicy beef - those tears were not just tears of happiness.  We wanted you at our wedding, but then...   Then that horrible thing happened, so horrible that I could not face you for years. I was shocked, sad and confused. What do I say? How do we move on from this?   A few months ago, I came back. It was nice seeing you again and I'm glad you're back on your feet. It was awkward, but I think we can do this.  Your crispy beef is just as tantalizing as ever, the buns are fresh and juicy, the cold noodles are still my favourite.  It's good to know that you haven't changed and we can pick up where we left off. It's like dining with an old friend."}
{"text":"I like the \"homey\" feel to this place.  But alas as other Yelpers have pointed out this place is quite dingy and could use some cleaning up or a simple makeover.     However,  the food is quite authentic and tastes homemade.  A refreshing change from the usual Chinese fare offered by other restaurants.  But be forewarned--if it is labeled \"spicy\" on the menu then you will be served food that is completely filled with peppers and peppercorns!! not for the faint of heart!"}
{"text":"Situated below the street level on Dundas St. just west of Spadina, this Chinese restaurant is a hidden treasure. Super-spartan, super-simple, utterly unpretentious, this resto provides great flavour and the best bang for your buck. Order dumplings or buns from their vast menu and watch two ladies roll out the dough, form the dumplings, and steam them. I find this restaurant to be much better than other dumpling restaurants on Spadina which are better known because of their location."}
{"text":"Really enjoyed the soup-filled dumplings. Generous portions & very reasonable prices. Perfect comfort food on a chilly day. Unobtrusive service, so it was a nice place to linger for a bit. I found it clean and tidy, about the same as every other Asian noodle or dumpling shop in the city (that isn't a chain restaurant). I love dumplings and have been searching for a downtown alternative to Mother's Dumplings and Dumpling House (both of which can be a little hit-or-miss when they're busy), so this place was a real find. Will definitely go again!"}
{"text":"Second time in as many days.  Do not get the homemade noodles with beef soup (83). The broth was pretty much water with a hint of beef. The actual beef fared better, tender with good flavor. The home made noodle was dense, thick and doughy.  Not worth it.  Steamed buns with pork was average. Extremely doughy, meat flavor really mild and unremarkable.  I wanted to put a crapload of chili oil and vinegar on everything but the condiment jars were crusty and dirty so I was very hesitant to have any.  Xian pork sandwiches were decent and cheap.  There were other steamed buns that looked smaller than the ones I had so I'm going to try that next time.   I asked the waitress if there was a better soup option - something with more flavor. She recommended the dry noodles which come in a different broth which is supposed to be more flavorful. I'll try it next time.   I'm sure this place has got some decent dishes based on others reviews, I will give it another shot."}
{"text":"Their service is terrible, food is dirty and makes you sick, waitress would throw chopsticks on your table.  I am a chinese immigrant and loves Shanxi style spicy cold noodles. i found this place last month and thought their cold noodles were the best flavored in toronto. However, everytime i eat their noodles i get a diarrhea. Literally everytime. after three visits(one of which I only ordered cold noodles), I could only conclude its the noodle thats making me sick.   I would continue to go to this place just for the noodles, but honestly, the prices are very steep for what you get. you can easily spend over 45 for two if you want any variety at all. restaurants on korean town cost no more than 20 for two...   On my second visit, the kitchen staff had a huge argument... they were in a quarrel before i came and lasted for another 30 minutes while i was dining. there is a family with a newborne baby in the restaurant too, everytime the argument gets loud the baby would cry... and no one of the staff bothered to tell the two kitchen staff to cut it out or argue outside. Completely inappropriate behaviour for staff to be arguing that long. they were threatening each other  to call cops... horrible dining environment. will not be returning."}
{"text":"Very delicious and authentic chinese shanxi style food. Handmade noodles, buns and dumplings are the specialities. I went in china two times and this is one of the best places I've found to eat authentic chinese food outside china. The place is a bit a mess and no frills and also this is very chinese style. I love it. It can lead to addiction ^_^"}
{"text":"Service and vibe were much better than I expected, having previously read about CTB here on Yelp...  I had the spicy tofu \"brain curd\" appetizer which was warm, garlicky and super tasty (think dim sum Dou Fu Faa texture but savoury) - a bit on the salty side but a steal at under $3.00.   The cumin beef & green peppers stuffed in bun was well spiced but cold, unfortunately.   Finally, the piece de resistance of spinach, egg & tomato noodles in soup was delicious. I expected more broth in the noodles but this dish was more like pasta - wide, thick and chewy noodles not unlike tagliatelle. Interesting and a new discovery for me in terms of regional Chinese flavours.  I also brought home egg and zucchini dumplings plus vegetarian dry noodles for my boyfriend, who (a) is vegetarian and (b) isn't normally very adventurous with Chinese food, which tends to be further exacerbated by (a), and he was suitably impressed.   Mandarin skills are definitely a plus at this joint. Mine sucks but I wangled my way thru enough dialogue to get my server to smile and give me a couple of recommendations. We'll definitely be going back to CTB to try more!"}
{"text":"No frills, but nice to find handmade northern-style Chinese fare. Tasty food in a homey, somewhat dingy (if you're used to western-style places, but this reminded me of dumpling places in China), friendly underground setting. Decent prices.  Woman sitting up front rapidly folding up trays and trays of dumplings. Smiling older gentleman hand-rolling and pulling noodles that you can order straight away. Laid-back service (they forgot one dish, but eventually noticed when we had finished everything and were still sitting patiently waiting for more).  We had Dan Dan noodles (smaller/medium portion, but delicious fresh noodles that were well-balanced/full of flavour with the topping), pork and chive dumplings (not the most perfect-looking, but tasty nonetheless), green onion pancake (fantastic and crispy on the outside, with a satisfying thin, chewy centre) and steamed red bean buns (great texture of mashed red bean inside). Washed everything down with hot, unsweetened soy milk from the large carafe and a Coke.  Will definitely return, especially for the noodles!"}
{"text":"I tried the gou bu li bun and the red bean bun, both of which I really like. However, a lot of their other dishes are either slightly salty or oily, or both. Their meat dishes are rather meager, granted it's still tasty. The environment of the restaurant feels a little dingy. The condiments on the table seemed unused and moldy. Overall, I might still come back because it is one of the few authentic bun eateries near eaton centre that I know of."}
{"text":"I know what people complain about, and there are many things you can complain about this place, but really, if you want authentic northern chinese food, this place is great. The cold spicy noodles and the hot spicy noodle soup are something I have to have once in a while, and no one, at least no one in downtown toronto makes anything like what they make here. Maybe I'm not being really fair, I do admit that my objectivity is impaired cause I'm just desperately love the food here."}
{"text":"This place is a hole in the wall place in Chinatown, place looks very dim and run down, but for me I don't go to chinatown expecting great service or decor. I was here for the food! I saw that this place serves Soup Dumplings, and since I have been on a quest for about a year to find a decent soup dumpling place, I came to try here out.  Soup dumplings were not great, skin is wayyyy too thick, and the filling lack flavor and the meat was a bit grainy, this seems to be a problem in every toronto restaurant that I have tried soup dumplings in so far. I haven't found a place that serves decent soup dumplings yet.   We also tried their boiled/steamed pork and shrimp dumpling as well as their pork and napa cabbage dumpling, both were just ok, nothing to write home about. Ingredients did not taste fresh here, and the condiments were caked in residue, so I was kind of scared to use them.  Service was slow, the only positive thing I can think of is that this place is pretty cheap, but that is not something I will return for."}
{"text":"Don't be fooled by the basement setting and pile of garbage mops outside the doorway. Or the slaughter house style plastic portal behind the front door you dirtily push through. Don't be fooled by the lack of English language skills or open door to the kitchen in the back which looks a little too dirty to be open. Don't be fooled by the many, many tasty options on the menu...get the Dan Dan noodles (#95) and pay the extra $1 to get the homemade hand pulled ones. It's a treat."}
{"text":"Authentic street baozi in every sense. Food will spoil your mouth , ambiance will spoil your immune system. Toronto Western Hospital within walking distance. Yes, there are more gourmet and photogenic buns uptown, but they are not within walking distance to Cold Tea and warm hookahs.  Pros: Accurate street bun mouthfeel. Dan DAMN mien.  Cons: Tuberculosis. Maybe haunted."}
{"text":"This restaurant serves Chinese steamed buns as their specialty. The ones that are front and center on the first page of the menu are best. They also do other stir fried, noodles, etc. miscellaneous Chinese food.  The buns are the only things really worth having but it's hit or miss. If you happen to be there when they are hand making the buns then and there they are delicious and delicate, packed with flavor. If you show up on a day when they are pulling them out of the freezer and steaming them they are mealy and stick to the cloth that lines the bamboo steamers.   Earlier in the day there is free soy milk available on a serve yourself basis but when this runs dry from the large carafe they do not refill. The waiters are terrible, speak very little English and mumble when speaking Chinese. They are slow and sometimes do not bring all the dishes you ordered. The decor is terrible and the hallway to the washrooms are lined with chest freezers that take up half the hallway. The restaurant is in a basement and in winter it can be treacherous to get down the stairs after a snow storm.      This used to be a great restaurant and would make the buns on a rolling basis so they were always fresh. I still go back occasionally hoping to catch the just made buns."}
{"text":"Homey authentic specialties from Shaanxi in an unassuming space.  I was exploring this chinatown area as a first time visitor to Toronto, looking for some interesting authentic food, and was feeling a little discouraged until I noticed this subterranean gem specializing in Shaanxi cuisine.  I insisted to the very nice woman in there that I wanted to try something new and authentic (its often a struggle for me as a non asian to convince places that I want the real stuff), and she directed me toward the oddly titled Shaanxi bread with quality mutton soup (or something to that effect).  I was greeted with a robust bowl of, yes, quality broth with meltingly soft boneless mutton meat chunks and a bit of veggies and clear noodles bobbing up happily through the healthy layer of sheep fat gracing the surface. Yum.  And with a little encouragement the woman instructed me on how it is normally eaten-rip the bread into tiny peices and leave them to soak in the soup.  And then she really caved in and brought me some pickled garlic and pickled chili paste which are also apparantly eaten with this dish.  I highly recommend the cold, sweet pickled garlic to balance the heat and fattiness of the soup.  It was great and I floated out of there, boyant with sheep fat, feeling like I had just travelled to northwest China.  Highly recommended for adventurous outsiders or homesick Xi'an Chinese (though the latter probably aren't reading yelp ;)  I would definitely go back to try some buns and noodle dishes.  She said they've been in business for 9 years."}
{"text":"It's weird that this place is named as traditional buns but the buns are not as good as other food they have.  I'd recommend their Xi'An Liang Pi (??) and Rou Jia Mo (???) instead of pork buns or soup dumplings..."}
{"text":"Truthfully speaking I was hesitant to go into this semi-underground restaurant in the heart of Chinatown.  Upon first impression the place is....sketchy from street level.  Plastic strip curtains cover the door, you can't see into the restaurant from the street.  Upon entering though, the place is surprisingly clean and even decorated pretty appropriately for a Northern Chinese dumpling house.   The dunmplings were such a treat!  The meat fillings weren't overly fatty or salty but very flavourful.  We also tried the steamed buns which ended up being one of my favourites.  The value here is exceptional and the dining space is actually comfortable and clean.  You can see the ladies steaming and wrapping the delectable little dumplings and at the other end of the restaurant chefs are cooking up some signature stir fried dishes from the wok.  Don't be afraid to step into Chinese Traditional Buns, you won't regret the visit."}
{"text":"I really liked this place. I also have an odd obsession with dumplings right now- it's what I'm constantly craving these days haha . Anyways....I placed an order through uber eats  - Dan Dan noodles and the pork- ginger soup dumplings were really good. Pork-chive and the pork-dill fried dumplings were delicious. I also liked the fact that when i asked for extra chilli oil and black vinegar the restaurant was super generous- which I always appreciate. I will be ordering from here again in the very near future"}
{"text":"The best steamed buns (at least the only ones I can find) in downtown Toronto.  If someone can direct me to some better non-pork filled STEAMED buns, I'd appreciate the ability to compare. Until then, CTB it is.  Underground, yes a bit dirty. Best for take-out. This is the only place I've found that has a vegetarian-friendly bun that is filled with fresh ingredients.  The red bean or lotus bean paste buns are addictive! I can eat all 4 of them before I even get home. Ooops need to go back for more!"}
{"text":"I'm not proud that I know or even eat at this restaurant, but the truth is out now. This dumpling place is located in a dingy basement. When you walk down the dirty flight of stairs you come to a clear plastic curtain at the doorway which keeps out the cold in the winter months. The space itself is not as bad as you would think (it could be worse) maybe a little scuzzy and don't even get me started on the restrooms. Moving on, the soup dumpling is what I usually order here. They are okayish albeit on the small side. The broth is flavourful and doughy wrapper is a tad on the thick side but you do get that explosion of flavourful soup with the pork & ginger filling when you bite into it. Overall a decent dumpling for the most part.   Today I wanted to be adventurous and ordered something entirely different:  soft tofu soup and mung bean noodle salad. The silky soft tofu is swimming in a soya based tasty broth with cilantro, seaweed & chopped pickled veg, not bad. The mung bean noodle salad is dressed with a garlicky sesame soya vinaigrette;  tasty but the noodles a little over cooked. All in all a positive adventurous experience I do not regret. Maybe a little ashamed, now my dirty little secret is out but I will endure head held high."}
{"text":"I ordered Dan Dan Mian and Xian Cured Pork in Bread. The taste wasn't bad, but I wouldn't revisit."}
{"text":"Great place in Chinatown for fresh, homemade Chinese snacks (xiao chi).  Cucumber salad was fabulous, ranks with the best I've had in China, Taiwan or anywhere else.  The salad's sweet/sour dressing was perfectly balanced.  Hot and Sour soup was also creditable: tangy and not over-goopy from cornstarch.  Fried Taiwan-Style dumplings (shui jian bao) were fresh and tasty but a little heavy on the dough.  This is forgivable since these dumplings are notoriously difficult to find in North America.  Meanwhile the crab/pork soup dumplings (xiao long tang bao) were pleasant, though also heavy on the dough.  In China these dumplings, frankly, would be considered average at best.  But for Downtown-Chinatown in Toronto, they are a treasure.  If you have time, by all means make the worthwhile trek to Din Tai Fung several miles north for truely world-class dumplings (especially xiao lung bao).  But if you are need a place near downtown, this is it.  As for cleanliness, CTD is acceptable for a simple hole-in-the wall place.  If you like small, simple Chinese places, be prepared for some compromises.  This isn't a corporate chain with corporate level washrooms (or computerized food).  Compared to what sanitary conditions you would likely find in a similarly simple place in China, CTD does very well!"}
{"text":"i must have started this review 3 weeks ago. since then, i've been out of town for 2 weeks, tried a couple other Northern Chinese food places, and back to eat at CTB three times!  i can't get enough of the extremely spicy chilis and hand-pulled noodles from Chinese Traditional Bun. i suggest both sensations, but not together. and while i tend to handle fiery foods pretty well, my esophagus feels like i downed tequila and my stomach churns for the next two days... SO it worth it!   i thought that maybe my insides would get used to it, but not so. so i warn potential diners not to plan any major physical activities in the two-day aftermath.  my favourite items so far:  - hand-pulled noodles in a tamer broth. the texture of the noodles gave me pause. while you can get it without broth as \"dried noodles\", don't b/c that version comes out sticky and overcooked. - super spicy fish and bean sprouts in chili broth, for the thrill of the spice.  - spicy fish with pickled vegetables, for \"hot & sour\" flavour. - mildly seasoned, savoury version of tofu \"silken desert\" soup (just $1.99 for single serving). as described.  convenient and good: - four fried red-bean dumpling desserts are served freshly fried, but not quite as fluffy and more dense than i remember elsewhere (just off yonge, north of steeles). to be eaten immediately, rolled in granulated sugar and finish off a spicy meal.  - buns: egg & chive or pulled pork. get one to share or you'll be full before other items arrive.  too spicy or too bland: - ma po tofu (ts) - chili chicken (ts) - sliced beef rolled in onion pancake (tb) - sizzling lamb (tb)  * free, unlimited, hot soybean drink helps to calm the heat."}
{"text":"Went here last weekend with my partner and some friends.  Food was delicious, particularly the dumplings, buns, and handmade noodles.  My favourite were the egg and chive dumplings.  Yum.   I know it's a little dingy, but they've made some efforts to spruce it up."}
{"text":"I cannot have enough negative comments to say about this place. I ordered 3 items from this place via Uber eats, when I got the food, the package was broken, soup leaked all over me when I opened it, and there was a of disgusting looking HAIR in the noodles. AND ONE DISH WAS COMPLETELY MISSING! I double checked to make sure I placed order for 3 items! To whoever is considering coming to this place or ordering Uber eats from them, please back off and never come here for your own good."}
{"text":"Yeah, it's \"authentic\" chinese if you include the insects crawling around, the disposable cutlery and the poor service.  I'm not sure why this place gets good reviews.. it's soooo dirty.  And not dirty-authentic, and not even dirty-with-character.  It is just plain dirty.   The food is average- it is definitely better than what you think woul come out from a basement place.  And there is a damn charming old woman who makes hand-made noodles at the front.  But I just can't imagine why you would decide to be a repeat customer at this place. Definitely does not hold a candle to Asian Legend just a block away.  And the prices aren't even dirt-cheap enough to justify going here."}
{"text":"I found this \"hole in the wall\" very good.  I loved the dan dan noodles and the spicy fried eggplant.  Quite reasonably priced too.  Obviously not much at all on atmosphere but to me that added to the charm.  I was the only anglo eating there.  Give it a try for sure."}
{"text":"Haven't been here for a long time. I felt the food quality went down a lot. I ordered the crab meat bun and a hot noodle soup. Both flavor are off. The noodle was ok but I think the meat they use might not be fresh... I don't think I will come back again soon..."}
{"text":"My favorite place for delicious, cheap, traditional Chinese buns!! The buns are always meaty, doughy and perfectly fried. They always have plenty of dumplings and non-fried buns to choose from. I'd go back here in a heart beat. This place is slightly hard to find, the sign is a bit tattered and you go down a set of stairs but when you enter you'll know right away that this place serves OG Chinese buns."}
{"text":"I found this restaurant while walking along Dundas one day with my girlfriend. She spotted photos of noodle on the sandwich board outside and on a whim I suggested we try it out. Entering the restaurant leads you down a set of stairs, so it's always hard to know what you're getting into, add to that Chinese Traditional Bun has these large plastic strips over the entrance for the sake of the guy they have making noodles at the front of the restaurant who sets them to cool outside.  The hand made noodles is what really struck me with this restaurant. They tasted so fresh and sweet that all the dishes I had with them (usually very spicy) tasted better than any other restaurant I've had them at. That includes the steamed dumplings (very comparable to Dumpling House which is the other restaurant I order dumplings at and that I highly recommend).  The restaurant has what you would expect from a basement restaurant in China town. The washrooms are small and suspect, and there's a ton of boxes stacked against the wall on your way to them. The tables are covered with plastic sheets, and the servers don't speak a lick of English. It's still easy enough to indicate what dishes you want, or to ask for extra water or napkins. I find the hostess/owner very friendly as well, she always smiles and asks me how I found my meal.  Switching gears, there was a murder in the kitchen sometime last year, which I find unfortunate and ridiculous, but not something to stop me from coming back. I've taken large groups of people here and we've had great times talking over tasty food."}
{"text":"Went a few day ago around 3 pm...the owner is very friendly but really care more about the food. See photos attached for those  Very tasty buns tasty Jian Bing like from that movie Jian Bing Man  Very good price  Get pickup to go if you want a nice place to eat. This place is designed for making good food not sit in extravagance.   Will try Dan Dan noodles next time"}
{"text":"I wish it was even possible to give negative stars. There was not a single good experience with the place.   We ordered soup dumplings, which took forever. When we got it, there was no soup but just oil.   We were going to pay with our credit card and they don't accept American card OR American debit card, only cash or Canadian debit card.   We gave them American cash and was short 20 Canadian cents and they still wouldn't let us go until we pay extra 10 USD which is like a 1:1 ratio.   Worst service I ever had as they never even came to check up on us or even provide any service. Soup dumplings took more than 30 minutes.   So if you're considering this place, even McDonald's would be a better option that this place. These two place probably aren't even comparable since McDonald's is so much better. Bad service, bad food, bad experience.   You have been warned."}
{"text":"Okay so this is my first Yelp review and I feel like I have to let others know about this place :) I decided to go into this place completely randomly... It gets a 4 star because it's so freaking tasty and a good price. The place is really traditional, the price is good and the noodles are prepared by the front door, really :) but it's not very clean... so if you are paranoid about  cleanliness of Chinatown restaurant you might not get a good feeling eating here. But I loved it, friendly service, good food, good price."}
{"text":"Great Dan Dan noodles. Spicy but not overwhelming. It could have used a bit more Sichuan pepper flavor. Dumplings were a slightly thick but tasted good and felt homemade. The restaurant was small and sketchy but I loved it. Great spot, would definitely come back."}
{"text":"The buns are really legit. The skin and filling are both delicious and exactly like grandma's cooking. Prices are low as well so you can definitely get full without spending a lot.  Service has never been a strength here. After the unfortunate incident last year that ended up on the news, it seems that they renovated and changed some things so the ambiance is slightly better. Still, it helps a lot to go with someone who speaks/reads chinese as not all the employees understand english."}
{"text":"I ordered through Just Eats. My order was 100% wrong and when I called the restaurant they refused to admit that they sent the wrong order.  They were not willing to do anything to help my situation - send the correct order or help with a refund. I called Just Eats who followed up with the restaurant on my behalf and they denied knowing anything about the situation."}
{"text":"So one Saturday we were on the look out for authentic Shanghai soup dumplings along Spadina and simply could not find anything! Luckily, we popped into this authentic looking chinese restaurant on Dundas and struck a little bit of gold...Real soup dumplings!  I'm not sure where else you can get these downtown, but Chinese Traditional Buns does a great job of them, along with a bunch of other tasty food. This place is cheap and extremely tasty...If you're craving some tasty chinese be sure to check this spot out!"}
{"text":"The restaurant itself is situated in a basement next to Dragon City. Overall, my first impressions of the restaurant was that it was very filthy and sketchy. I quickly changed my mind when I tried their dan dan noodles and soup dumplings. My take on the restaurant? Don't judge a book by its cover. The restaurant may be borderline fugly when you first walk in, but you'll walk out feeling very satisfied and wanting to come back for more in the future."}
{"text":"Not the most... clean looking establishment but the food is quite good.  The buns, spicy noodles (dan dan noodles) and dumplings are delicious!"}
{"text":"This is no high end restaurant. It lives down a set of steps, it's door protected by flapping plastic. The interior is no hell. But the steamed and fried dumplings and the Dan Dan noodles are terrific. Their hot and sour soup is undistinguished, their tea lukewarm, but the rest is excellent and reasonably. Two of us ate our fill for $35."}
{"text":"This place feels like home. There is no where in downtown Toronto that truly has authentic Northern Chinese Food.  Yes their menus are a bit sticky, the basement stairway is pretty precarious and they leave meat lying around but if you mind that, then good luck eating in China for real.  My favorite order is usually pan fried buns, cucumber salad and a soup (Hot & Sour, Mutton and actually any of them are solid choices).  What makes me sad is the handmade noodle master has moved back to China, I pray for the day he returns.  Overall, my favorite place to eat."}
{"text":"The buns are too die for, and the hot soup buns seem quite the feat.  The interior of this basement restaurant is slightly dilapidated so I'd recommend takeout buns for the diner who is picky about atmosphere."}
{"text":"Ordered delivery. Terrible quality. Food is cold and not fresh. Avoid this place at all cost"}
{"text":"I am a New Yorker, very familiar with Traditional Chinese Food from eating in it's suburbs of Flushing, Queens, where the population is heavily  chinese. I came here expecting real authentic scrumptious food based on the reviews. Quite to the contrary. First off, the establishment/location didn't turn me off at first sight as you migrate your way through the steep downward stairs to reach the basement level \"restaurant\".. Then you situate yourself at one of the 12 various-sized tables.   My issue comes with the cleanliness of the interior & quality of the dishes. When you sit down, you lay your hands upon the table. Sticky... Nope. Worse- sticky is not even the proper word to use. Use your imagination. Whatever.. I kindly proceed to ask the server to wipe down my table. No issue. She was actually very sweet, despite the language barrier. (Unlike the 30-something year old man cooking, very rude)   Second, we damn near ordered everything from the menu. Pork/Chive Buns, Pork/Shrimp Soup Dumplings (unappetizing extremely thick dough), dan dan noodles, cold noodles, off the menu chicken broth with noodle soup, my husband ordered biangbiang with added \"shrimp\" (+$5 surcharge)--no joke, they charged $5 for 6 minuscule shrimp, you know, the ones that come in a microwavable noodle soup (cup-o-noodles/maruchan)   All in all, we ended up getting everything wrapped to go & paid $70. We had to throw away the food and walk around to find anything to fill our growling bellies. My husband and I are not cheap whatsoever. We usually pay north of $70 minimum for a decent meal (Not including drinks)   Though here, I have never had such regret going to an asian restaurant. We barely touched the food. One small bite and done. Never again. Very unclean, food laid out, soy milk in a bucket on the floor, and food had no flavor whatsoever. Ohh and the wait for food to come out while we were the only ones there: almost 50 minutes. If your hungry and have taste buds, do yourself a favor and go somewhere that's not here.   (P.S- I am a kind reviewer but I truly felt the need to be transparent and detailed about this place. They need an overhaul. Fast.)"}
{"text":"It's absolutely horrible, even cold noodle was bad and food is kind of gross... I think I'll have a bowl of I stand noodle now. So gross for 30 bucks of food"}
{"text":"We went all the way to downtown Toronto for their cold noodles and the flavor disappointed us, the noodles were too thick. We ordered gou bu li buns and kai feng soup buns too, whose skin were thick as well while not too much stuffing. We couldn't keep the soup inside the buns at all the skin just broke when we tried to get the bun.We finally didn't tip as it was an unpleasant lunch and the service was really slow. I've had better northwest Chinese food, will never come to this place a"}
{"text":"Chinese Traditional Bun is this tiny hole in the wall in downtown Chinatown. The place itself is in a basement on the small strip of Dundas near the corner of Spadina. This is certainly a place I would have walked by 9 times out of 10, but the girlfriend stopped me because she definitely wanted to give them a shot.  The place itself is small, dank, and a bit dirty. The menu offers a wide variety of steamed buns and dumplings. The dumping soup was actually not that bad. The dumplings, though small, tasted pretty good, and had a good amount of fat in it. The broth was fine as well. The steamed buns were decent, but much better could be had uptown.  Not an ideal place for a date by the way. If you are looking for some place nice to take a date, get out of Chinatown. Otherwise, if you are alone (aren't we all), feel free to drop by to satisfy any quick dumpling or bao cravings."}
{"text":"First time experience was good, ordered the beef noodle soup and pork and green onion buns which were both yummy. However service and food quality seem to be going downhill. The place is dirty and sticky, waitress is not very friendly. Don't get the beef soup filled dumpling, it doesn't have a single drop of soup in it and was completely tasteless!"}
{"text":"I'll be upfront in saying that when it comes to restaurants, I have a preference for dives 9 times out of 10. Dives seem more honest, almost as though the food is so important that the interior isn't.   Well, this place is a dive. Almost literally. It's a small dumpling and noodle house, at the bottom of a steep set of stairs. Watch your step!  I'd read a friend off of Yelp's review of this place and when I read that the noodles here are hand pulled, well I just had to go.   This place really is a dump. Others have said the same so I won't keep beating that drum, but its simplicity was something I sort of took to. The lack of music, not so much. Even if I don't understand the music played at most Asian restaurants, it's still nice to have something in the background or if there isn't any background, something to fill the air space. So, there's things they could work on. But that's not what's important. The food.  Those hand pulled noodles. I'll cut to the chase: They're quite good. A nice chewy consistency but still cooked all the way through, I got the fried noodles with beef and it was awesome. I was impressed. Lots of flavor, and a generous heap for $9. They reminded me of the Midnight Market Noodles I'd had in New York at the only Burmese joint in the city before it closed down.   We also got the soup dumplings, pork and chive. Good, but not great. They were a little bland overall, but the filling was good, maybe a bit too much ginger.   Last but not least, we got the beef and potato and onion pancakes. Pancakes were a bit too thick and overall the flavor on this dish was also a bit bland, but they were $8 and still good. The beef was fatty and tender, the way it should be.  Service was okay. Nothing crazy here, the staff doesn't seem to speak a lot of English and you essentially take your own order down, but thats not new to me as I eat pho quite a bit and am used to it. I've almost come to prefer doing my food orders this way!  I'd come back here as the prices are pretty good and the noodles too. It offers something most of the other Cantonese places on Spadina don't.   Check it out!"}
{"text":"Where I'm from, there is no Chinatown, and the available Chinese restaurants offer typical American-Chinese faire. Whenever I am in a big city, I make sure to check out real Chinese restaurants, which led me to this place.   My favorite food, arguably, are soup dumplings. Checking Yelp reviews, I noticed this place had soup dumplings. Then I discovered, \"The Incident.\" I immediately knew I had to come here.   It's a pit: basement level, dusty, open containers, sticky tables, the most cluttered kitchen I have ever seen. I took my fellow Yelpers advice to not look around and just trust it. My friend and I gave each other several of the, \"Should we just leave\" looks before deciding to bite the bullet and order.   The tea they serve was delicious. I think I drank two pots just myself. We ordered some type of noodle dish, soup dumplings, and soup buns. I discovered (when my food came out) that this place calls what I know as soup dumplings soup buns. Luckily I ordered them. And they were delicious. We were full so did not finish everything, and one of the workers came over and thought we did not like the food. She was apologetic, although we tried to tell her we loved the food, it was just that we were full. Very nice and caring.   We thoroughly enjoyed our meal here, and I would recommend this place to others. Just follow everyone else's advice: don't look around, just order."}
{"text":"If you like hair and dirt in your food, diarrhea, and food poisoning,  this place is for you! Others should eat elsewhere."}
{"text":"Do not let the grimy, sketchy entrance deter you from descenting those stairs into a quite nice looking restaurant inside. Space is quite small but it is a hidden gem of the city. The kitchen is upfront so you can watch the two chefs do their work. I believe the woman does the buns and appetizers and the guy does the noodles and main dishes. Anyways, we ordered an onion beef pancake, Dan Dan noodles and a beef brisket soup with Bok Choy.   Onion beef pancake: - Outer shell was crispy but not oily (big plus! Hate super oily pancake), they used hoisin sauce to piece everything together, laid down one whole stem of green onion that flatten and lightly charred on the stove/grill. The beef was super tender, literally just melting away in my mouth.  Dan Dan noodles: - Noodles were cooked to slightly higher than a al dente, toppings were minced pork, wood ear mushroom and something else...burdock root I think then all of that was nicely drowned in chili oil with extra chili chunks added. Super spicy but I loved it!  Beef brisket soup with bok choy: - Broth was delicious, no MSG taste, it was pure beef broth, noodles were more softer almost soggy in texture but still good. Beef brisket chunks were also quite tender and had plenty of cartilage.  Total came to about $34 for two people which to be honest is pretty good. I was gonna go to Swatow but they were packed and I'm glad we took the right path eating here. Definitely hit up this place if you want amazing Northern Chinese style food. Kudos to Uncle and Aunt cooking in the kitchen."}
{"text":"MUST TRY: Chili tofu appetizer  Recommended: Soup Dumplings (buns) Sliced potato appetizer  OK: Cumin Lamb   Chili Tofu was a good start. It's like a savory and spicy version of Tofu Fa.  Cumin lamb surprised us because it is lightly breaded. We love lamb, especially cumin lamb, and this is not what we expected at all. We would order lamb skewers instead.  The soup dumplings / buns are good. We liked these.  Note that the check in offer for \"Appetizer under 4.50\" is limited to sliced potato or cucumber salad. You need to ask them for this up front. Sliced potato was a good version of this traditional dish.  Note: For all the discussion of this place being dirty, they have renovated with the last year or so. It's not bad at all. Also, the kitchen is at the front, so you can see what they're doing. I didn't notice anything unsanitary.  Prices have already increased in recent years"}
{"text":"I was a bit apprehensive before going, due to the polarized Yelp reviews. However, I'm definitely glad I did since the wide variety of food was decently priced, and quite yummy, and hit all my cravings.  Good items: - Pan friend buns - Soup dumpings - Garlic/Spicy Potatos - Rou Jia Mo (meat bun) - Lamb bread soup  - Liang Pi (cold noodle salad)  Price was great, interiors were clean (and probably reno'ed) and I had enough leftover for breakfast the next day."}
{"text":"Worst restaurant I have been in Toronto! This place is really disgusting, poor service, disgusting food, dirty environment..... After eating the \" Chinese cold noodles\" which I think is their specialty, I felt uncomfortable the whole day. They put a lot of salt, garlic , and MSG into it like they are free!! And the dumpling I ordered is full of green onion instead of meat! Really disgusting, the food , the decor , the service... Never again!!!!"}
{"text":"Came here with some Yelpers for the \"UYE: Dirty Chinese\" that Lauren organized (thanks!). We were a group of 6 which was just the right size to share a bunch of tasty dishes. Highlights for me included the chicken & mushroom steamed dumplings and the fried banana dessert (bananas fried and dipped in syrup, then quickly dunked in ice water so the syrup hardens into a crunchy shell). The green onion pancake, however, was disappointingly bland.   The subterranean location is a bit shady and the whole place is kinda dingy, but I didn't see any bugs and dishes were clean. You can watch them making the dumplings in front, which is nice. Service was swift and accommodating. The bill came out to $10 per person for lots of food."}
{"text":"This food is seriously traditional! I have never had this authentic Chinese cuisine outside of Asia. Definitely recommend."}
{"text":"overrated or maybe food quality had gone down....whoever said this place was good....I don't know  The place is located down the steps but look for the signs on top and you'll see.  The entrance is kinda like crap with the ladies making the buns on the right and junk on the left.  There are settings but the place pretty much look like a grimmcky Chinatown restaurant.  I took my table for one and the server handed me the menu with a notepad.  Confused since she didn't say anything and I was going to order in canto anyways, I still looked at the menu.  She didn't even bother coming to get my order until 10 minutes when I just handed her my paper with the number of the menu choices that I want.  I ordered the Dan Dan noodles and the steam buns.  As I waited,I'm looking around and I literally felt dirtier.  The condiments looked old and uncovered.  The plates were stained and I saw a guy get some soy bean milk from what looks like the ground.  My noodles came and it did look delicious!  After mixing it all in and had my bite, it was good but not as good as it looked.  The noodles were undercooked but fresh, so it was doughy.  Some of the toppings were overcooked so it was like mushy.  It needed some more vinegar or something.  The buns though....I have to say...THE MOST SOUP I ever had in any buns!! It was overflowing! And the soup was delicious but everything else was okay.    For 2 items, my total was 15.86...which is one of the more expensive meals I had out there.    For the price and taste...I'm not coming back..there's way better options."}
{"text":"I had high hopes based on the dingy interior, but found the food pretty hit or miss.   Good: Rolled Pancake with Beef Pork and Dill Dumplings Xiao Mai with Bok Choy mushroom and Tofu Cucumber Salad Pork and Chive dumpling  OK: Wonton in soup Panfried pork and cabbage dumpling  Bad: Soup dumplings with pork. These were really skimpy on the soup and were salty almost to the point of being inedible. Cumin Lamb Skewers. They did not have nearly enough cumin and chili on them and were somewhat stingy.   Not super expensive, but not cheap either. I'd consider going again if I ordered carefully, but probably wouldn't go out of my way. Cash or Canadian Debit only."}
{"text":"This place is not good despite its promising name and appearance.  I know a lot of you *cough*nonasians*cough* might think that this is one of those hole in the wall places that look disgusting but the food is amazing and authentic.  Yes, this is a whole in the wall, and its physical appearance is a direct reflection on the quality of the food.  Your reverse psychology just backfired!   I tried two kinds of their buns, they were soggy and looked sloppy.  Making buns is like an art form; they should be beautifully made and uniform.  The buns here are more towards the home made side, and not by a great home cook either.  The fillings were overly processed to the point that the meat has lost its texture.  Their handmade noodles were no better;  they were doughy but lacked bite (signs of staleness).  To add insult to injury, this place wasn't cheap!  I got an order of buns, noodles, and an orange juice; my bill came to over $20!   This place is typical to the restaurants that you would find in the run-down parts of China, where even the locals may have reservations about.  Their transplant here doesn't make them any better.  The bun store at the Finch and Midland plaza in Scarborough is waaaayyyy better."}
{"text":"This place has amazing chinese food taste wise. I have ordered the cold steamed noodles (liang pi) many times, but today I found a hair thats stuck in the noodle, absolutely disgusting!"}
{"text":"Chinese Traditional Bun, a dirty little secret tucked away in a basement spot on Dundas across from Pho Pasteur.  This place is surprisingly under-yelped but it kept coming up on Chowhound and Urbanspoon as a good place for dumplings and I thought it deserved investigation.  When I say dirty, it really is. The floors were littered with food and was in desperate need of a sweeping up. The food was honestly so good that I'm still giving 4 stars regardless of it's dinginess.  There are a few nice ladies running this place. One speaks English and is happy to make menu recommendations. There is another older lady who is making fresh dumplings and noodles when you enter.   Chinese Traditional Buns has a very unique menu with lots of Northern Chinese dishes that I haven't seen on any other menus.  First up was the Xian cured pork sandwich ($2.29, bargain). Looks like a CHINESE HAMBURGER!! The pork was served on a small thin bun which looked something like an english muffin, and was flavoured and garnished with green onion. This was really tasty.  Next came the dumplings - egg & zucchini steamed ones. (12 for $4.99). This was my favourite dish, REALLY tasty and fresh. I want more!  Next were some steamed buns \"Gou-Bu-Li buns of Tianjin\". Whatever that means. 6 meat filled buns for $3.99! These were good too but not as delicious as the dumplings.  We also ate a delicious eggplant dish that was properly spicy in a sweet glaze sauce. ($7.99 for a giant plate)  Tons of unique menu items here, I will be back to investigate further."}
{"text":"Ordered fried noodles but not what i expected, decent though. Soup filled pork buns are like xiao long bao but thicker wrap or almost dough-like. Pork/shrimp dumplings are good too. The jasmine-like tea served is ok, but the highlight is the hot soy milk for free which goes well with the cold weather. The tables are covered with white plastic so its kind of awkward to the eye, maybe better if its the transparent table cover instead of plastic. its a plus if you are with a cantonese, mandarin, chinese speaking friend."}
{"text":"Came here to have xiao long bao for my breakfast and good call on my part!  Here they call their dumplings \"soup-filled buns\" and so I had their pork (B2) and crab (B3) both 6pcs.  I didn't like the crab one and didn't finish it. But I LOVE their pork xiao long bao. It's so damn good. I was surprised when it came out because the dumplings were a lot bigger than a regular xiao long bao.   I am definitely coming back here again just for the pork one!  Not a 5 star because the crab one wasn't good and my original bowl wasn't cleaned properly. Inspect your dishes and utensils before you eat here! Flavour is good!"}
{"text":"If there is option I would rate 10 stars!   The name is very unappealing : Cvinese traditional buns. They simply  translated their Chinese name to English. But what the restaurant sign really reads : Chinese Staple Classic Buns. Which is quite telling what they sell--- things that taste like mainland China. Judging how big the Chinese population is in Toronto u'd be surprised how Difficult to find Mainland Chinese food that is eaten by billion people back home. In Canada majority Asian population is Hongkong background related n they have complete different diet.   This is a place that brings u straight to the alley way in China that has little dinners making fresh buns n dumplings and noodles from scratch! That you could smell the aroma from distance. U instantly feel like you are in China.   They have the most DELICIOUS buns! And dumplings. I have tried true pork buns, red bean buns. All delicious and fluffy mouth watering. I have tried their beef and Chive dumplings, pork dumplings and egg Chive dumplings . All 5 stars !   My personal favourite is NO.7 called ----pan fried steam buns. On the menu they look boring (upside down flipped over with browned bottoms up) but when they are served they are Sooo moist fluffy, there juices flowing inside the pork with ginger n green onion inside is so delicate. The white buns are freshly hand made , steamed to perfection and then pan fried at bottom. I have brought 6 friends there n each of them r hooked on these. And since then they have been coming back on their own. My bf's first time here he refused to order saying he was not hungry that he ate already. When these were served, he tried one n ate all my serving saying it's the best thing he has ever had.   Their Chive egg dumplings r so yum. I am a meat lover but these are so tasty that is one thing I order without meat.   ---- how to make steam bun/dumpling dipping sauce:  Sniff the sauce bottles( because they both say Soy sauce but one is soy, the other is VINEGAR!!!! Lol ). Mix 2 parts soy sauce, 1part vinegar, some chilly oil .   I have since tried other locations in China town , still not one place has more authentic flavour than this one. This place specialize in dumplings too which is 100x better than the Dumpling House .   The service here is very good. They are very polite and very attentive. The menu is old and sticky and non explanatory. So if you bring someone speaks Cantonese or from Hongkong expect them to help with the menu then won't be much help. lol but just trust that the food here is good.  Start with Their beef noodles and dumplings and pan fried buns.   They recently renovated the place entirely . So previous ratings saying they were dingy which was true ,you no longer need to worry. The place is very inviting now :):)"}
{"text":"Sure it's a dive but the food is still delicious. I came here with a few Yelpers after hitting up the AGO. We had a smattering of food, most of which I had never tried before. The soup dumplings were interesting, though I don't get the point of them.  We ate until we could eat no more, then when the bill came it was $12 a person. SERIOUSLY, only $12 each!"}
{"text":"I would have give Chinese Traditional Bun a 3 star.  The floor is sticky..but is ok, I am not eating from it..  The deco is plain and non existent, but is ok, I am not eating that  The food is decently good made fresh.. and I have fun with a group of my fellow yelper..  The dumplings are all made to order, served fresh and steamy hot!!  But why 1 star??   Not only the ready made buns were lying around exposed and that lady that making the dumplings in the storefront didn't even bother washing her hands after she finishing using the bathroom...  If I didn't witness.. I would say ok... anything can happen when I am not looking..but.....  GROSS!!"}
{"text":"The ??? pork belly bun was horrible. No vegetables inside and it was very dry to taste. Won't come back again"}
{"text":"There is a serious lack of northern Chinese food. Traditional Chinese Bun is the only place I can think of that actually makes me feel like I'm in Beijing. It's my go to. Don't order outside of their specialty (soups, steam buns, and some northern style noodles). Don't expect wonderful service or a clean environment, but for the price it's just wonderful. Also the people are super nice. Don't base your interpretation of their service quality on their English skills."}
{"text":"Judging by other positive rating and reviews, I had high expectations for this location. This is by far the worst soup dumpling place I have eaten in my life. The soup inside the dumping was overfilled with oil. At that point, I wasn't sure if I was drinking soup or oil. The service was awful. We waited at least 20 minutes for the waitress to come over and ask what we want to eat and at least another 30 minutes before the food actually came. If you think the restaurant was crowded, you thought wrong. We and another group of table were the only group that were in the restaurant and yet they still took forever. The service wasn't the best. This place was very disappointing."}
{"text":"I like to give hole-in-the-wall places the benefit of the doubt for being authentic, from past experiences elsewhere. This place was sub par...but at least it was cheap?   Food: I ordered chive and pork boiled dumplings, tianjin style buns, Dan Dan noodles, and pickled cucumbers (from the Yelp check in offer of 1 appetizer under $4.50). Dumplings and buns were good, they are made in house. Pickled cucumbers were okay but came last. Dan Dan noodles were okay, good spice level!   Service/atmosphere: there is a pile of random stuff when you walk in, so the restaurant does not look professional. On the way to the bathroom, I also passed another pile of stuff including a suitcase(?!). The bathrooms were out of toilet paper and one even has a broken toilet seat. The inside is freezing too."}
{"text":"Chinese Traditional Bun is literally a dirty little secret. It's filthy. It's small. It's hidden in a basement in Chinatown.   They pull their own dan dan noodles and have an extraordinarily long menu of soups, noodles, dumplings and buns. The staff doesn't speak much English, so if you have questions about one of their dishes and don't rock Cantonese, you're screwed. Write your number on the piece of printer paper and hope like hell.   PEPPER TAKES PAUSE: It's really dirty in here. My kitchen has a better chance of getting a passing health code grade."}
