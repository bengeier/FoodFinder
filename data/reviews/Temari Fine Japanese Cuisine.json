{"text":"This by far THE best sushi in the valley. No joke, everything is to die for! The sushi chefs are amazing. I like to sit at the bar here even though I usually opt for a table elsewhere. Their menu of specialty rolls is a bit intimidating I admit but, just let them know what you like and they'll make excellent recommendations. I must say, the sauces are beyond anything I've ever tasted. If it were socially acceptable, I would pick up the plate and lick it clean. I'm not exaggerating, they're heavenly perfection and unlike no other.
Please be aware there are no prices on the menu. Apparently it changes based on market fish prices and it can be a bit pricey. If I lived closer I'd be there all the time, seriously. No matter where you live, it's absolutely worth it!"}
{"text":"Best Japanese restaurant in town. I highly recommend. Primo roll and Cha su ramen is my fave."}
{"text":"This is the best sushi I have had in AZ.  Even my partner loves this place and he is pretty particular about fish quality since he spent quite a few summers fishing in Alaska.  We live in downtown Phoenix and often make the drive out here because it is so good."}
{"text":"This is absolutely my favorite sushi restaurant anywhere and I lived in LA for 10 years! Our whole family loves it! Tuna poke is ridiculously flavorful and fresh, the Phoenix roll is layer upon layer of delicious textures with a slightly spicy sauce that takes it over the top! Service is so friendly you really feel that your patronage is appreciated. We will support this business as long as we live in AZ!"}
{"text":"Some of the best sushi in town!  
Love the tuna pokey and then my favorite the Green Apple roll!  Yummy"}
{"text":"Hands down, the absolute freshest sushi I've ever eaten and this is now the only place I'll go for sushi! A++++"}
{"text":"The best sushi I've ever had! You would not expect it but don't judge a book by its cover! I don't know how they do it but everything I've had is amazing. My one complaint is that the restaurant is so small... There are seriously probably 8 tables? So sometimes you have to wait quite a while. It's worth the wait!"}
{"text":"small hole in the wall but best sushi in town. The tuna poke and Vegas roll is the best I have ever had. Saki will make any kind of roll you want just tell him what you like and he will make it for you. Miso soup actually taste yummy instead of like dirt."}
{"text":"Love the food here the grilled beet tariaque really good suchi is the best love love it affordable price and the lunch boat that they have"}
{"text":"Best sushi restaurant by far. Love the varity of rolls. Baja roll, green apple roll, poke, surprise roll, sumo roll, grand canyon roll are my favorites, but I have about 25 plus more favorite rolls. Saki and Danny are the best!"}
{"text":"I eat a lot of sushi and this place does not disappoint. They have a wide variety and have extremely fresh fish. The sushi chefs truly know sushi. I highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Temari is the best sushi restaurant in the East Valley, maybe even the Phoenix area. The fish is unbelievable fresh, the service is wonderful and the sushi rolls are unlike anything you'll see anywhere else.

OK, granted, the place is a bit of a hole in the wall. There's not much seating, it's tucked back into a strip mall, some of the staff barely speak English and it's not going to win any interior design awards. However, if you're looking for great sushi in the East Valley, you simply must try Temari.

Saki is the owner and head sushi chef. He is usually accompanied by Danny, who I can only imagine is his protege. They churn out wonderfully delectable sushi rolls, nigiri and sashimi. The thing I really love about this place is the creativity of the ingredients and combinations of some of the rolls. Sure, you can get the standard California, Spicy Tuna, Rainbow and Caterpillar rolls, but for more adventurous fare, try the All-star roll, or the Primo roll, or the Saki roll. You will be greeted with ingredients such as deep-friend green chili, asparagus, red onion, a variety of sweet and savory sauces--even black pepper and bacon in some cases!

I would highly recommend the tuna poke if you're a Maguro tuna lover. This is a really unique dish that you won't find at many other places.

At the end of your experience, you get a small scoop of strawberry ice cream and a Fortune Cookie with the check. A nice touch that I think is meant to take the edge off the bill (even though the prices are quite reasonable, especially compared to the Blue Wasabi's and Ra's of the world).

If you have a large party, I would call ahead to see how busy they are. As I mentioned, the place is small, so you might have to make a reservation or be prepared to wait (it's worth the wait though, trust me).

To sum up, if you want overpriced rolls with soggy rice and stale tuna, but served by good-looking people in a shi shi environment with techno bumping, try Ra. If you want phenomenal sushi and great service in a more humble setting, Temari simply can't be beat."}
{"text":"To be honest the worst experience of my life. First time a restaurant didn't want to make me food. I ordered the calamari and I think they made it in the microwave! I sent it back wanted to get sushi instead and the chef told me no I can't just try food and send back. Because I sent that back wouldn't make me anything else.  I'm not a person that just sends food back trying to get free food.  They were just rude to me and my husband. We will NEVER go back!! If I could I would put no stars!"}
{"text":"Not good for takeout. Unfortunately, I can't say what the food tastes like. I walked in for takeout, ordered a couple sushi rolls, and was told 20 - 25 min. Seemed a bit long, but decided I'd just run a quick errand and come back. Server got my name and number. I came back 25 min later and was told it'd be another 15 min. \"They had gotten swamped.\" Pretty sure they just forgot my order. I just cancelled my order and went elsewhere."}
{"text":"Yum yum yum. This place is awesome! Saki is the main sushi chef and he does amazing things! The ninja roll and the ginger bomb are our favorites!!"}
{"text":"The rolls themselves were good, but that was the only good thing about this place.  It was poorly lit, the darkest restaurant I've eaten in.  The sashimi was small, half the size of what we've gotten at other sushi restaurants.  One of the waitresses was rude to my brother - we had kept a menu so that we could keep looking at the rolls in case we were hungry enough to order another one later.  She came over and started trying to take it from him while saying \"Are you done with that?  I need it.\"  He had no idea why she was trying to take it from him when he was obviously still using it, and we had to guess the reason why (she thought he was going to take a picture of it since his phone was on the table).  Not wanting someone to take pictures and politely explaining that would have been fine, but trying to take something out of his hand while refusing to give any explanation was not.  Also, I usually order sushi for take-out, and rarely come in to eat in the restaurant.  If they don't have a list of their rolls on-line, it's not on their take out menu (we asked), and we're not allowed to take pictures of the menu, how am I supposed to know which one of their 150 rolls that I want to order?  The answer is, I don't - and any restaurant that makes it that difficult for me just to place an order has lost me as a customer.  I also agree with some of the other reviewers on here - they do have a large number of rolls, but most of them just use the same ingredients in different combinations.  The scallop dynamite wasn't very good, it was extremely watery with just a few very small bay scallops thrown in.  According to a sign on their wall they charge for forks.  The sushi menu doesn't list prices, and they also don't itemize the bill - not cool, that alone would keep us from returning."}
{"text":"Amazing sushi! Small joint, mom and pop restaurant. Ramen was amazing! Sushi couldn't be better. We will be back again for sure!"}
{"text":"I LOVE sushi, and this by far, is the best place in town I have found. The Chef is nice, as well as amazing at concocting great recipes. There is an enormous menu to choose from, so come a little early so you can go through it all!

There is one waiter that works there, dont know his name, but he is a prick so expect that..."}
{"text":"Incredible food. Great service. It's our new favorite restaurant. The owner was so helpful in deciding what to order for our first time. We will definitely be back to try more rolls"}
{"text":"Beware!!! 
The to go orders are 1/2 the size.
If you eat in the restaurant you get full portions

Don't order to go unless you aren't hungry.
I called to inform, and instead of them fixing the issue, they told me to review poorly and tell yelp \"we like when a customa eat a here\":"}
{"text":"Best sushi ever!!  I'm from Canada and every time I come to phoenix I go to temari at least once if not twice. You must have the primo roll and the tuna poke!! To die for!!!"}
{"text":"Tried this place out today because I was craving sushi really badly. I've seen this place so many times but i've never wanted to try it because it really didn't look too nice on the outside. I read the reviews on Yelp and decided to give them a chance and i'm really glad I did! I had a couple of questions about some of the rolls but the sushi chef was happy to answer them and give me some other suggestions. He said the Primo was the most popular one on the menu but i'm not into super crazy rolls so I decided to try the lobster tempura roll instead. It was SOOO good and came with this tangy dipping sauce that really made all the flavors in the roll come together. I also had the calamari which was super juicy and crunchy. The lobster roll and calamari both came out to be around 15 bucks all together. They also serve you a free scoop of ice cream before they give you the check. Over all the quality and the price was 4 star quality. 1 star missing just because the server wasn't the most helpful and never really checked to see if I still doing okay."}
{"text":"Best sushi spot in AZ, I have eaten at many sushi spots and this one takes the cake! It is the most creative and innovative sushi in AZ, see saki at the bar for some sake recommendations and a custom roll."}
{"text":"We were n the search for a good sushi joint after our local favorite place changed formats and went Viet-cuisine.  Temari is a funky little spot. Love the layout and Japanese decorations that fill the narrow room and make it feel cozy and inviting. The sushi selection is great - we loved the Primo Roll and the Pink Lady Roll, and a few others I can't recall (the list of specialty rolls is a mile long). Great atmosphere, not stale and generic like you get in some restaurants around town."}
{"text":"This is our favorite sushi restaurant to go to! It is a small place so on a busy night expect a small wait, but it is worth it! I love Tuna Poke and I have had many varietals that are awesome, but this place makes a basic poke that is awesome. And you have the option to order on a heat scale of 1-10. And I must say, don't try to show off with this one, a 2 packs a punch and we have gone up to the highest of a 5. Their rolls are pretty good but we always order the Spicy Ninja and sometimes add in a plantain roll or a tucson roll. If you like to eat and drink like we do, this meal will get pricey and don't expect very attentive service. The staff is very friendly but if you have to ask for a glass of water more than twice, that's normal."}
{"text":"I have been going to Temari for several years and the food is consistently excellent!!!  The service is great too!!!  We always order a large Asahi beer and it comes in a frosted mug that is so cold that small icicles form when the beer is first poured.  We almost always get the same thing because we love it so much.  Tuna Poke #7 with extra sesame seeds.  The # designates the level of heat (1-10).  Primo roll and Spicy Ninja.  We substitute the spicy tune in the Spicy Ninja with smoked salmon because we get tune in the poke and in the Primo roll.  It's a really nice substitution.  It's always nice and cool in the restaurant and they play cheesy 80's music in the background which we love too.  The meal is concluded with a small scoop of strawberry ice cream with a fortune cookie on top.  It really is the best sushi I've had anywhere especially if you like rolls.  The roll selection is the largest I have ever seen and the sauces that they use on the rolls are unlike anywhere else.  It's fabulous!!!  My only reservation about writing this review is the fear that too many people will like it as much as us and we will have to wait in line to get a seat.  However, a good place like this deserves to not only stay in business, but be rewarded with steady business.  Hope you enjoy it!!!"}
{"text":"My husband and I have been going here for 2 years and every visit is wonderful.  We hate the trendy places like Ra etc and I'm really surprised at some of the reviews on here.  It's a small intimate place and our last visit Friday night, we arrived tp a full packed house.  And there's a reasonfr this, the best sushi on this side f the valley."}
{"text":"Danny and Saki are always friendly and suggest new rolls. I usually only eat sashimi and the fish is always very, very fresh. Only once in a dozen times going there was the service bad."}
{"text":"The best sushi ever! I like this place, it's a bit small but other than that the food is amazing I'm never disappointed by them!"}
{"text":"Such a great hidden gem! So many amazing sushi rolls to choose from! Service was excellent! Everyone was very friendly! The Primo Roll and the Dynamite Mussels are a must try! We will definitely be returning!"}
{"text":"Best place for sushi! His handmade rolls are the best! Absolutely love the Miami roll,the American roll, Val Vista roll, just about any of the chef's own creations. Great mom and pop shop. Just wish it wasn't so pricy, I'd be there every week, but I guess that's sushi, right?"}
{"text":"First time coming here and we loved it!!! We tried The Primo, The tootsie roll, the green dragon and the Gilbert! We loved every single one! This is our new spot for sushi rolls!! They have so many combinations of sweet and spicy! The dragon roll was topped with kiwi and jalapeño so amazing!!! Trust me you will not be disappointed!"}
{"text":"We have been to so many sushi restaurants and the poke here is the best. Also a must try is the Hollywood roll. It's not on the regular menu but if you ask for it they will know it!   Primo roll is also a must try delicious!  For interesting tasty rolls and poke....this is the place to go."}
{"text":"This place is the real deal! I have been coming to this Sushi joint since I moved to AZ in 2010. I have tried pretty much every other sushi spot in town, nothing compares. They get 3 or more fresh shipments per week of fish- Danny and Saki are the only two sushi chefs they have and are always there. Danny has been there for 7 years and Saki for 10 years. These guys don't mess around, whether you're a regular or trying it for the first time they will not disappoint. The only complaints I have heard from very few people is that they don't have a \"happy hour\" menu for there sushi like Ra- in the sushi world this is a good thing because they are never trying to get rid of their fish from the previous week. I recommend this place to all of my friends and family and when I have people in from out of town this is my go to spot. If you cannot decide what you want from their HUGE list of rolls just tell Danny or Saki your preferred fish and let them do the work. I am one of MANY satisfied customers and will continue to go here on a regular basis. Thanks for always providing a great sushi experience! 
-Stanley & Alison"}
{"text":"This place is by far the best sushi in the east valley. Their tuna poke is simply amazing. Sake is the best chef around."}
{"text":"Outstanding! I've been coming here for so many years now and NEVER had a bad meal. The owners are wonderful with a friendly family-staff. The sushi is amazingly fresh! Having eaten at many different Japanese restaurants, I have a strange habit of comparing Miso soup as a kind of 'litmus test'...no  surprise, their Miso is tasty! Try the Teriyaki Beef if you're not in a sushi mood or their Ramen bowls are as good as any I've had in Japan. Even the quirky 80's music they seem to always play is endearing. Truly a hidden gem in Gilbert."}
{"text":"I've been here twice, both times alone for lunch.  Both times I sat at the sushi bar and received phenomenal service from the owner, Sake.  He suggested great rolls and talked my ear off, which I didn't mind when I was sitting alone.

I liked the sushi because it was fresh and different, and I liked that the owner was there and enthusiastic about the place.  I mentioned a few other local sushi places and he was very classy about them--he didn't have anything negative to say about anybody else or try to tell me his place was the best on Earth.  He also listened to what I had to say about each roll I tried, and made a suggestion based on my feedback for the next time I went in, and suggested that I come in with a few girlfriends for ladies' night.

Some sushi places bring you out a little salad or some miso soup (or both) before your meal, but not here.  After I finished my meal I got a cute little scoop of strawberry ice cream with a fortune cookie pressed into it.

The bathroom was fairly clean, but old and had dingy fixtures.  The wait staff service was polite, but not horribly prompt or friendly.  The lights in the dining area were dim enough to partially hide the fact that the whole place could use a good deep cleaning.

The reason I gave Temari four stars instead of five is the cleanliness of the place.  The sushi bar was immaculate and Sake was definitely cleaning as he went behind the counter, but I was not impressed with the dinginess of the dining area or the bathroom.  Despite this, I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Fantastic!! I was only in town for one night and this was by far the best choice.  something bad roll was amazing!!"}
{"text":"We moved here from southern Cal and have always liked the smaller, more intimate sushi bars we found there. The last two years have taken us all over the valley trying various sushi bars and find ourselves returning to Temari for above average sushi and rolls in a smaller, more personalized atmosphere. The service is above average and we have yet to be disappointed in the quality of the food. Danny and Sake are talented and knowledgeable sushi chefs and the prices are definitely below what you would expect to pay for the quality of food served here. 

While I enjoy sashimi and sushi, my wife loves the Sumo roll and also has a new favorite that Danny makes special for her called the MB roll. 

Do yourself a favor and stop in if you are in the area. Don't let the location or exterior appearance fool you, this is an above average, regardless if where you are from, sushi restaurant."}
{"text":"Place was crowded,  so it must have something going for it.  Gyoza were good.  Chicken Kara-age was boring, unless you like plain fried chicken.  Seafood Ramen was good, but a bit bland.  Gilbert Roll was really good.

Now for the service - Horrible.  After the last item of the meal was set down, the next interaction was them bringing the check.  No, \"How is everything?\"  No, \"Can I get you anything else?\"  No, \"Would you like another Kirin?\"  Nope, more like, \"Here's the check, pay me and get out!\"  Ruined the whole dinner.

Food- 3.5
Service- 1.5"}
{"text":"Was not impressed. The seaweed salad was drowned in sesame oil and every roll was entirely overwhelmed by sauce (there was a quarter cup of garlic sauce left on the plate when we finished the Primo roll, no hint of exaggeration.) And for a place that charges for forks, you'd think they'd pack the rolls a little tighter so they don't utterly disintegrate. It was heavy, heavy fare and we left feeling overfull and gross even though we ate about half as much as we usually do on sushi night (and both had gas pains for a couple of hours afterward).

The free strawberry ice cream was not delicious and the fortune cookie was downright weird."}
{"text":"Primo roll, Green Dragon roll and Hawaii 5-0 !!!!!!   So fresh, with distinct flavors.  I'll never go back to California or Spicy Tuna rolls.   An absolute \"must try\" for sushi lovers."}
{"text":"This was hands down the best sushi I have ever had!! We sat at the sushi bar and each of our rolls came out one by one so we actually had time to savor each bite! I could not be happier with this place. Best atmosphere and honestly the best tasting sushi we have ever had. Sushi chefs at the bar made the experience one of the best we've had. Definitely recommend!!"}
{"text":"Best sushi in Phoenix! The best rolls are not on the menu and you need to ask the chefs what they recommend. The service may take a little longer, but worth it!"}
{"text":"I don't usually rave about a place unless it really deserves it, this the best experience I have had in a sushi restaurant.  My wife is ultra conservative when it comes to trying new things.  The \"chef?\" talked to her for a while to get to know what types vegetables and fish she usually enjoys as well as her personality and then created her three itmes she just raved about.  We've been back several times since...."}
{"text":"I hadn't been to Temari in a while but was just as happy as ever at my recent visit. I tried some of my old favorites (Las Vegas roll and Firecracker) and some new ones like the spicy lobster.  Still quite tasty.  For my money the best sushi in the valley."}
{"text":"Favorite local sushi place. They have the best rolls and fresh fish in Gilbert. Try the poke- it's spicy and really yummy. We also love the hot and saucy roll!!"}
{"text":"I was stuck in Mesa on business trip for 3 weeks and was dying to have sushi. 

OMG, this was one of the worst sushi experiences ever. Some of the items were so atrocious that I took one bite and even did not touch the rest, which do not happen often. Shari was made poorly, fish was not so fresh and the knife skill was crude.   Seriously, I was so afraid that I would get sick after eating there (I didn't).  This restaurant is NOT authentic.  

I actually feel bad giving only one star since everybody at the restaurant was so nice (well, except that they totally ignored the fact that I did not touch one piece of the remaining nigiris. Shouldn't that be a red warning sign that something was definitely wrong?), but hey, when the food is memorably terrible, you can't help it."}
{"text":"Very pleasant surprise.  Not at all expensive.  We live a few miles away and were disappointed by some other sushi places in the area so tried this.

It's a little small and often crowded.  There wasn't a wait but we went late at night.  The sushi was great, the people around us were friendly, and the chef made suggestions on the fly for our otherwise very basic order.  My wife stuck to her usual.  I listened to the chef.  We were both happy.  Definitely on our 'try again' list."}
{"text":"Best sushi hands down!!! Huge selection to choose from. Everything we had  had was so fresh and the flavor was awesome. If you are looking for sushi that isn't your typical sushi, but that tastes amazing, this is your place!"}
{"text":"My wife and I ate here very often for three years. About 7 years ago we moved back to california. We walked in after not being there for 7 years and saw the same exact faces greeting us like we were there the day before. The food is great. The service and people who work there are the best. 

Never a rip off. For the location of mormanville, east valley of phoenix, you WILL NOT find a better place."}
{"text":"This is our favorite go-to for sushi!!! Always great service, always great food!!!  Be prepared to wait, but it's worth it!!! Amazing Grace, and Ginger Bomb are a fave!"}
{"text":"Sushi was awesome... The grand Canyon roll was our favorite.  Restaurant was cute but almost too small.  Service was pretty bad. Not going back anytime soon just because of the service."}
{"text":"It's extremely hard to try new places after eating here! I can't see myself going anywhere else for awesome sushi! I have had probably 15 different rolls here, and I haven't been disappointed yet! I try a new roll every time I ago. But the primo roll is definitely #1.  And highly recommend the Amazing Grace Roll and the #2 roll that is not on the menu."}
{"text":"So I am not a huge sushi fan and was a little worried about going here with a friend. But boy was I wrong to worry. Danny was our chef, and he made me feel at ease and helped me figure out what it was I wanted to eat. The entire staff was nice and friendly.
I ordered the poke (Pretty sure it is called something else), tempura shrimp and the \"other\" shrimp that was NOT the sweet shrimp (thank goodness). It was all really good. 
I walked out of there feeling good about trying another sushi restaurant in the future. Too bad I don't live in AZ; otherwise; I would definitely go back to Temari."}
{"text":"I've been coming here since they opened over 15 years ago! Saki was a manager and sushi chef at Ah-So where we fell in love with his edible art! He soon opened his own place and we promptly followed. 

The sushi is absolutely delicious! Can't say we've ever had a bad dish. Sashimi is fresh and the salmon melts in your mouth like butter! Even the regular, yet traditional, Asian dishes are right on the money! 

They are too busy to take reservations, and Friday and Saturday have long wait (for a reason) so I would recommend other nights if it is your first time. They are also open for lunch Monday through Friday from 11-2 so it is a great time to try it out. 

Finally, if you are the adventurous type, and can't decide, let Saki know what ingredients you like and he will make you a roll to match! So far we've never been disappointed!"}
{"text":"Ok so I like sushi but I LOVE temari. Usually I'll want sushi maybe once every other month or so but since I was introduced to temari I want sushi every other day. Everything I have tried is so fresh and full of flavor. I have ordered something different every time and have always been blown away by how good it tastes. I highly recommend temari."}
{"text":"I just moved to the Mesa area not too long ago and hadn't looked around for a sushi place. I got the craving the other day and hit up Google Maps and saw this place and all the good reviews.

I ordered the Caterpillar Roll and some nigiri. Very good all the way around! Fresh and very tasty! I didn't eat at the restaurant so can't really comment too much on the service...but everyone was nice and helpful while I was and the person who answered the phone was helpful.

I will be ordering lunch from there regularly and will be trying out more of their menu as I go!"}
{"text":"Went in after looking at the reviews by everyone and looking at the menu on yelp. The prices showed the rolls I wanted at 6.50 each. Great, I went there and on the menu, it shows the rolls at 7.75 each. I informed the waitress that I pulled up the menu on line and the price was different. She rudely told me \" PRICE 7.75!\" I showed her the menu on yelp and she said \"WE NO CARE WHAT SAY ON THERE, WE NOTHING TO DO WITH THAT, PRICE 7.75\" we ended up ordering the rolls anyway and they were pretty good but very small compared to sushiya sushi in Gilbert. We ended up ordering 4 rolls, 2 soups, a beer, and a bowl of rice for an infant, in which we were charged 5.00. WOW! The bill ended up to be 50.00 and although the food was good, I would rather not return, first because of the price discrepancy, second due to rudeness, and third, better value for same great food at Sushiya. I give 4 stars for the food, take two away for the rudeness and bad experience due to poor customer service. Oh, and by the way, I mentioned the great reviews on yelp to the waitress, and she said \" We don't care about that\" \"it's not our restaurant, it's someone else down the road somewhere\" WTF, are you kidding?"}
{"text":"Can't say enough about this place. After travelling thw world and trying sushi in every major city, THIS is the place to go. Who would have known!"}
{"text":"Great sushi spot in the area. Sushi always comes out cold and is well made. They also make authentic hand rolls here as well. Big fan of their shrimp tempura roll for taste and presentation"}
{"text":"RUDE RUDE RUDE!! These people in here don't want your business! We have been here once and will never be back! The people act like you are putting them out by eating here! My ramen was disgusting and even smelled foul! I walked up to the counter and explained it didn't taste good and the lady just shrugged her shoulders!! I was in shock, really?! Oh well, I walked back to our table and my husband and I agreed we will never be back!! Nasty business!!!"}
{"text":"Hands-down the best sushi in town. And I've tried 1 million sushi places. I love the owners, I love the rolls. The sashimi is so fresh it melts in your mouth. The tuna tataki is amazing. I get the Sunkist roll every time. I'm so glad I'm moving back to Gilbert so I'm closer to Temari!"}
{"text":"Best Sushi in the East Valley! I enjoy a big sushi menu that is a little different from the normal stuff you see. Temari has 3 pages of sushi rolls! Also, they have great dressing for their dinner salad. My favorite items; AZ Roll, Primo Roll and Tetaki (seared ahi)."}
{"text":"THE GREATEST SUSHI IN ARIZONA.  if it's your first time, get the PRIMO and PRETTY IN PINK rolls.  Their menu is neverending. The Chefs are true artists and have mastered their craft.  You don't even need to look at the menu. If you tell the chefs what you like they will whip up a delicious roll for you, they're that good.  The menu doesn't have prices listed so be prepared to spend a few bucks.  But its worth it.  Every roll I've had is delicious.  Thank you Temari!!!"}
{"text":"I came in for lunch and was intrigued by the plethora of 5 star reviews at Temari's. Of course I wanted to check it out too!

The owner is very friendly, funny and welcoming. He takes the extra time to get to know his customers. The sushi list is one of the most extensive ones I've seen. If a type of a sushi roll you want is not on the list, the sushi chef/owner will try to make it for you!

I ordered some sashimi and nabeyaki udon. Brilliantly fresh and delicious! I will be returning in the near future!"}
{"text":"Absolutely the best sushi I've had in AZ. The roll selection is incredible!! Highly recommend!!"}
{"text":"First thing to say, our sushi took over an hour to get. Well, actually, we went out with friends (4of us total) and our friends got their sushi first (3 different rolls) and my husband and I waited for ours. Then one of our rolls came out and then 45 minutes later my husbands order came out and then over an hour later my roll came out. The sushi tasted good... though it was falling apart as you picked it up. We were disappointed in the fact that we couldn't even eat together at the same time and then when we asked at about 35 minutes where our other two rolls were we were told they were coming. Well I'm sorry but to wait this long for sushi is ridiculous!! Especially because during that hour wait for my food, other tables (who came in after us) got their food, as we still waited. And they didn't ever apologize or even explain the delay. We had to ask for our food.
We will NOT be back due to the ridiculous wait time and poor customer service."}
{"text":"Ordered the Primo roll... and it is PRIMO-amazing! The Green Dragon was my hubby's style with jalapeños and sriracha. Also, the smoked salmon sashimi was incredible... hands down BEST sushi in the East Valley!"}
{"text":"Holy crap! I thought I had to be close to to ocean to get fresh sushi, but I was so wrong!  Flew in from Los Angeles to have the most amazing sushi I have ever had made by the skilled hands of Danny!  A must if you come anywhere within a 100 miles AZ!!"}
{"text":"The food was great. Enjoyed chatting with the sushi chefs. The ambiance was really good for being a smaller restaurant. There was a little bit of a wait but nothing crazy.

I ordered the Vegas, primo and the Ginger bomb rolls. All were great!

Will definitely come back for more."}
{"text":"Awesome little sushi bar. We sat at the bar and visited with several regulars. Everyone here raved about the the place. I have to say it did not disappoint. Sushi and sashimi were fantastic and vey fresh. Also had the Poke which comes in heat levels from 1-10. I had the 8. Nice and spicy but I still could taste the fish. Loved it! Come early because they get busy fast. Definately one of the top sushi places around."}
{"text":"Absolutely love this place! Highly recommend the Primo Roll, Spicy Ninja, and White Dragon Roll. Service is amazing and everyone is super friendly"}
{"text":"I agree! Best sushi in town! Great place for a birthday dinner.  Let the wait staff know and they will take care of you."}
{"text":"I travel the world and still find that I get no better sushi anywhere than right here at Temari in Gilbert. I'm almost afraid to post yet another 5-star review for this place because I don't want it getting so popular that I can't get a seat! Sake and Danny do an outstanding job preparing fresh sushi. Their original roll creations are unparalleled. And their poke is excellent. (I like spicy, so I always order the 10-star hot.) I highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"Literally, without a doubt, hands down THE BEST SUSHI I HAVE EVER HAD. 
I am in serious food love. 
Like, I can never eat sushi anywhere else. I'm ruined.
But for the better. 
I had the absolute freshest tuna Poke ever here. In the middle of the freaking desert! How is that possible??! 
I had the #2, which I guess is wimpy heat. I've been warned that #5 can put hair on your chest.
Also, the All Star roll it to die for. But add ponsi sauce on it. Trust me. 
The owner and staff are the absolutely amazing. Remembered my husband by name after his first time there (I can't even do that :)
Go early, as there is very limited seating and it gets BUSY. 
All in all, I will be living here from now on."}
{"text":"Took forever to get out food and the service was OK...Food is good but Masa sushi is better..."}
{"text":"Been coming here for over 3 years.. If you are looking for the best sushi come here.. Saki and crew will take care of you.. They have many secret dishes that if you become a regular, you'll be ordering each week.. Our favorite is the \"Asparagus Garlic lovers\"   Wow! This one is a teat.. Don't forget the Sumo roll too.."}
{"text":"MY FAVORITE RESTAURANT in the valley. The BEST sushi hands down. The father and son team carefully crafts each dish and are just so warm and welcoming. Lovely service. They call my husband \"Mr. Gilbert Roll\" because we order four of them every single time we come. Never gets old! LOOOOOOOVE!"}
{"text":"BEST IN THE VALLEY and LOCALLY OWNED!!  You can keep your corporate owned sushi bars, I will only go to Temari for my sushi - a locally owned, amazing sushi bar!  A nondescript building, but doesn't that always house the best restaurants?

Order the Tuna Poke and the Primo Roll!  We sat at the sushi bar and the sushi chef, aptly named Saki, asked all about our preferences - spicy, citrus, sweet, etc and then delivered rolls to match our taste.  It was just fantastic!  

We will be back!"}
{"text":"Great little sushi place. Food is always amazing. The dining room is small but the staff and food makes it worth waiting for."}
{"text":"This place is so welcoming! Its a tiny restaurant but they keep the flow moving yet you don't feel rushed. If you are looking for sushi they have a variety choose from their menu. Literally like 40 types. Food tasted great!! Wednesday's is ladies night and you get 20% off your bill which was pretty sweet: at the end you get a scoop of ice team topped with your fortune cookie!! 
We got the:
-Miami roll. 
-Shrimp lover roll
-Val Vista roll. 

My favorite was the Miami roll. Definitely worth giving this place a try for yourself!"}
{"text":"This is by far the worst wait and service I have had at this supposedly great sushi lunch or dinner place. Brought my son here for my bday lunch and still waiting over 45 minutes for three sushi rolls. One sever and one sushi maker make this the most awful place that I will be sure to never come back again! I don't even want to give this place a one star!!!"}
{"text":"We came in last week because we wanted to see what the hype was all about.  This was hands down the BEST sushi restaurant we have ever been to.  We sat at the bar, and Saki, the owner made us rolls he thought we would like.  They were all excellent! We will be frequenting this restaurant a lot!!! I would recommend this sushi restaurant to anyone who wants really good sushi at an affordable price.  Great job!"}
{"text":"What is there to say... this is the best sushi you will ever have, period. I almost don't want to write this review because the place already gets so busy but it's so damn good!!!!!!! The primo roll is a restaurant staple. The green dragon roll will blow your mind. If you like garlic, get the garlic lovers roll, not on the menu but it's to die for!!!!!! The surprise roll, the spicy ninja, whatever you get, there will be love in it and you will be hooked. There is no better sushi, Temari is the best!!!!!"}
{"text":"Dined here for my first time last week. The atmosphere was straight out of Japan! I have lived in Japan before so I will definitely say the place hits the mark! The food was great, wide variety of sushi rolls and all the fish was fresh. They even provide a very cute ice cream dessert. The prices are a little higher than your typical sushi place but well worth it! I most definitely will be back!"}
{"text":"I love this place. Best poke in town. Baja roll it out of this world. Quaint little restaurant. I would highly recommend."}
{"text":"Tried a few different rolls and they were all excellent.  The menu, however, needs a little focus.  There are far too many overlapping options.  The service could have been better as the server was not very attentive."}
{"text":"The place has a three page sushi menu and more that others have posted about that aren't on the menu. The space is small so expect to wait on busy nights. Ambiance is casual but noisy, so don't bring the kids for a late dinner. Full bar and friendly staff. We went on a Friday night and they were busy. Sushi came to our table slow, which had pros and cons; we weren't overly stuffed or trying to eat everything at once but it made for a long dinner. At the end they serve a small dish of ice cream with a fortune cookie. Wish they had photos for some of their more unique rolls. It's definitely an overwhelming menu for a fist time visit."}
{"text":"This place is amazing! A nice quiet environment with friendly service! The sushi is fresh, we were able to try a new roll called the ginger bomb! I would recommend this, and add jalapeño If you like a little spicy!"}
{"text":"Just plain awesomeness here. Great service great food great sushi. The freshness of the fish is like being on the coast. I really missed this since moving to az but not anymore!!!"}
{"text":"Having some sushi at Temari in Gilbert.  Sake is the owner, has a binder with new creations he thinks of on a daily basis.  I would highly recommend this place for great Sushi!!!!"}
{"text":"Had a bit of a wait to get seated during dinner but nothing crazy. Write-down-your-order kind of establishment keeps things moving along and simple when you have lots of items going. Large selection of rolls and a pretty good sized menu of Japanese food outside of those as well. With a selection so large you'll end up with some hits and misses but the hits were usually quite good. Just up to a little experimentation is all. The more people you have, the better, since everybody gets to try something different.

From California which is a -tad- closer to the ocean but didn't have any issues with freshness in this place - but then again we didn't exactly go nuts on nigiri or sashimi to put it to the test, either."}
{"text":"We searched for years for a good Sushi place that wasn't a big chain. We found this spot about 2 years ago and love it! We have been about 15 times and the sushi is consistantly good!! The guys behind the bar (1 is the owner) are very friendly and welcoming! The servers are sometimes a bit slow and grumpy depending on the night....but overall we LOVE this place!"}
{"text":"My only complaint is that we have lived 1 minute from this place for 3 years and never knew it existed. The shogun roll, poke tuna and Saki roll (named after the owner and master chef) were all phenomenal! We met multiple patrons that had been going religiously for 8+ years and even came all the way from Chicago. The owner/chef was so engaging and the vibe was so fun. Everyone seemed like repeat customers that were so happy to be back.

This is our one and only sushi place from now on and it's right next to our house and gym (Anytime Fitness baby.). I love our neighborhood!!"}
{"text":"My wife and I have been coming here for years, quite simply Temari is our favorite Sushi restaurant. Service is excellent. Sushi is always fresh and delicious. Some of the other comments on this page are snobbish and redundant, those people need to go back to Ra and get their Disco Sushi."}
{"text":"I have found my sushi spot in Gilbert  finally!  It blows all others away.  The quality  of the fish is amazing and the staff is very friendly.  Will definitely  be back!"}
{"text":"Amazing sushi, kind service, great atmosphere. My first time trying sushi, now I am hooked, I will be back!"}
{"text":"I haven't been to many sushi places in this state, but for Arizona standards this place is good.

I'm not too picky when it comes to sushi, and am willing to try pretty much anything. As long as I don't get sick from food poisoning, I'm a happy camper. I've been here a bunch of times and everything that I have eaten has been really good.

Everyone that works there is really nice, the restaurant is cozy and intimate, and it isn't pretentious at all. Water glasses are always filled and everyone that eats there always seems to be having a good time.

They have a huge selection of rolls to choose from which to me was a bit overwhelming, but I wouldn't consider that a complaint at all. 

I always enjoy the free ice cream and fortune cookie they give you too :)"}
{"text":"We love Temari the staff and the food are excellent.  they have fresh and really well prepared Sushi there Chicken Terryaki is wonderful and even tempura is light and tasty without an of the greasy aftertaste you sometimes get with tempura.   The staff is really friendly and after a few visits ( okay maybe a whole lot of visits) they welcome my wife and ask if it's for the regular!   all in all this is one of our go to places for dinner and even takeout is great and really asset to gilbert and sushi lovers in the area."}
{"text":"This place is is amazing! Ask for the green dragon. It'll change you. Really though, they've got some quality sushi rolls."}
{"text":"We have been coming here for couple years now for our sushi craving, this place has solid fresh sushi and plenty of \"roll\" to choose from. The price is standard. The only small complaint I have is the roll can get a bit saucy and their Fried Lobster batter was thicked. 

Good food, server was attentive. You get free ice-cream for dessert!"}
{"text":"WOW!!! Hands down the BEST sushi in the East Valley! The restaurant is a little small and dated but very cozy, clean and the wait staff are fantastic. We drive the extra distance passing many other sushi restaurants along the way. The owner (Saki) is always friendly and the rolls he prepares are a beautiful work of art! The ramen bowls are fantastic too!"}
{"text":"Omg! By far the BEST SUSHI in the Valley! Wow! The Crab Nigeria, the Special Spicy Tuna Roll and Salmon Nigeria highly recommended! So fresh! Do not mistake their small storefront for the delights that await inside!  So excited for our new find!"}
{"text":"In how many different ways can you arrange the same ten ingredients?  If this were a contest, Temari would win, hands down.

This looked like one of the most promising places in a very generic East Valley sushi scene, so we decided to give it a shot.  When I sat down, our eager waiter asked me what I'd like to drink.  I asked him if they only have fountain sodas, and he looked at me like I was speaking Greek.  I said, \"What do you have, bottles?\"  He said they don't have cans or anything; it just comes out of a gun.  So... Fountain sodas then.  Got it.

My friend said his Mr. Pibb tasted off, and asked to switch to Coke.  He said sure, but he'll have to pay for the Coke.

Now, on to the food.... I looked at the menu.  I saw about three pages of rolls.  I looked at the specials board.  More rolls.  Looked at the regular menu.... Standard Japanese fare.  They have teriyaki.  TERIYAKI!  Who eats teriyaki?  This isn't Samurai Sam's, is it?

They have some sashimi.  All very standard cuts of fish.  Tuna, white tuna, salmon, yellowtail, sea bass, and mackerel is probably all they had.  Maybe the weakest selection I've seen, well, anywhere.  The nigiri sushi (which I'm pretty sure I heard our waiter pronounce as \"NIGH gi ri\" sushi to the diners at the next table) was pretty standard as well.  Ra has better selection.  Yes, that's right, Ra, one of the most notoriously generic sushi restaurants in the world, has a better selection of fish than Temari!

Anyways, at about six different points while I was looking through the tome they call a \"specials menu\" (which consists of about 99.5% rolls, plus tuna poke), our eager waiter asked us if we know what we would like yet.  Sorry, bro, can't you see I'm reading here!  I'm like half way through!  My eyes are getting tired from reading the words \"spicy tuna,\" \"eel sauce,\" and \"chili sauce\" so much!  Because 75% of the rolls have one of more of those ingredients!

It was amazing how many different rolls they had, yet how few of them actually sounded appealing.  Most of them seemed to be more focused on sauces and spice than actual fish flavor.  It's like people who eat sushi in Gilbert don't want to taste the awful flavor of fish!  Gross, right!  Fish, ugh!  I pointed out to my friend that one particular roll \"has like three sauces: chili sauce, eel sauce, garlic citrus sauce, and kiwi sauce. Four sauces!\" (imagine the Spanish Inquisition.)

Anyways, about our actual order: we went with the \"chef's choice\" sashimi platter, a romantic roll (cucumber with a bunch of stuff inside), a sunkist roll (some fish completely drowned in citrus flavor), and amaebi and quail egg sushi.  I think \"chef's choice\" means \"cheapest,\" because no real sushi chef would put both tuna and salmon on his own plate if he were picking what he wanted to eat.  The sashimi itself was OK I guess.  The rolls were very boring, as we expected.  The sweet shrimp was good, but you can tell what type of clientele they have when they placed the heads on our table, and the diners at the next table over seemed awestruck by the fact that someone would actually eat a shrimp head, what with those cute little eyeballs staring at them.

This brings me to the conclusion of this review: this place utterly destroyed our hope of finding a good sushi bar in the East Valley.  Shimogamo was respectable, but even there, the owner was unable to keep the best cuts of fish in stock because he had no confidence his clientele would buy enough of it to keep it fresh.  This is the East Valley.  People think sushi is a bunch of rolls.  You ask an East Valley denizen about their favorite sushi place, and they say, \"I like this place, they have great rolls!\"  Only here can a sushi bar stock just seven cuts of fish, and just offer 500 rolls with the same ten ingredients, and maybe serve some teriyaki chicken for those who REALLY hate sushi, and be successful.

I think we're going to look for the East Valley sushi bar with the lowest yelp rating, because that one is probably the best.  At least they didn't end up charging us for that extra Coke.

Addendum: I was just reminded about the fortune cookie they served with dessert.  A fortune cookie!  At a Japanese Restaurant!  On the back of the fortune it said \"Learn Chinese.\"  Not making this up."}
{"text":"WOW, I thought i had some good places to go for sushi, but this one was notably better. We came her upon recommendation from a friend. One of the customers seeing it was our first time here told us to try the Tuna Poke. Amazing! that is the tuna taste that I love. The other rolls that we ordered were also excellent. We had a table, but I could tell the people at the bar were also enjoying themselves very much trying Saki's(at least that is what they called him) creations.
The quality is the best I have had in the east valley. My only complaint would be that this place is pretty small so be prepared to wait a little. Or maybe that was just the group of 10 people that would not leave after they were done eating....
I will be back. Often."}
{"text":"Great spot for sushi. Started out with some gyoza, followed by inari, mackerel nigiri, and a lobster and shrimp uramaki .  Mom had the chicken teriyaki.  All very good.  The only thing that was flat was the miso soup."}
{"text":"Been here twice, both times, the service was good and the sushi is great. This is now our number one place to go for sushi. Between my husband and I, we cannot agree on our favorite roll, we did Primo, White Dragon and Amazing Grace, all were fabulous. Our son does Teriyaki chicken and he enjoyed it as well, some places serve processed chicken and this was good quality chicken."}
{"text":"Fantastic food some of the best sushi I have ever had. Highly recommend the green dragon roll!"}
{"text":"Always a WIN!!!! The Primo Roll and the Grilled Salmon Salad are to die for!  If dining in I would ask the Chef/ Owner for suggestions and or off menu choices, sometimes hell make something for you off the cuff based on your taste. Small quaint friendly place with good prices and incredible quality food."}
{"text":"In the past I have gone here and the rolls were great and fish was amazing. It's a small place so a wait is always expected during rush dinner times. Last time I went service was terrible. The servers are friendly but I had to ask twice after waiting an hour where our food was. Then they brought out half our order ( two rolls) and then never brought out our other order until I had to ask again. Then the salmon wasn't as firm as I would have liked and the shogun roll wasn't tight enough so it kept falling apart. This place has been around for a long time, but I think the quality is going down a bit. It's might be time to find a new go- to place."}
{"text":"I have been coming here for well over 5 years and is one of my favorite sushi places in the valley.  You wouldn't expect much from a tiny sushi place in Gilbert, but this place is definitely worth a shot.  The service is always fast and friendly.  Their prices are reasonable and have an excellent selection of  fresh sushi.  I have even told the chefs to \"surprise me\" a few times and they have always delivered some pretty amazing rolls."}
{"text":"Oh man, just had a Green Dragon roll.  AMAZING!  Baja roll is also the best here.  This IS the best place for crazy rolls!!"}
{"text":"Place is fantastic. Nothing better in the valley. Make sure to get 2 Primo rolls, one is never enough. Tuna Poke is also great."}
{"text":"Best Sushi in the valley!  & the fish is always fresh!  My favorites are the Tuna Poke, Sashimi, & the Lunch Special Boat."}
{"text":"Fantastic place for sushi in the east valley! Been going there for a few years now and have always had a great experience! My wife lived in Japan for 4 years and says it reminds her of the little sushi restaurants in Japan. The waitresses are always extremely nice...great place. Quality of fish is great! Rolls are fat and they always seem to have special rolls to challenge your taste buds. Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"Love this place. They have great food at a good price. Very fresh sushi. Not very much seating so you have to get there early."}
{"text":"I can't recommend this restaurant ENOUGH! Hands down the best sushi I've ever had and I have lived in close to 20 states and multiple countries. We moved away from this place 5 years ago to explore the best that California has to offer. Let me you tell, nothing ever came close to their flavor profiles, creativeness, and freshness. Nothing in LA, Orange or Riverside counties compared.  

Service is always top notch and I've never had a bad meal here.

They have a ton of extremely creative specialty rolls that will just melt in your mouth. The Primo roll is just heavenly and as close to perfection as you can get."}
{"text":"Awesome sushi, very fresh and with quick service.  Among a long list of rolls we had, we tried the Baha roll after the server told us it was a new addition.  It was incredible!  Highly recommend this place for your neighborhood sushi needs."}
{"text":"Temari never fails to defy my expectations for a neighborhood sushi place.  Chef Danny and co are super creative with some of their rolls and offerings and always personable. I think they like talking about sushi as much as they like making it! They could easily expand and reach more but stay true to their roots. 

The Primo roll is easily one of my fan favorites. Sushi snobs won't like the plethora of sauce and lack of serious spice but it's the perfect roll for those who enjoy a new bit of flavor in every bite!

Amazingly fresh and well prepared sushi is what you'll always find here. Budget time on the weekends and during peak eating times as they're sure to have a small wait unless you come towards the end of the night."}
{"text":"My wife and I were Die RA fans until last night when we tried this place out. This place is leagues above plus the prices are affordable for sushi so your not waiting around for awkward happy hour times. 
I will be recommending this to all my friends and family."}
{"text":"Sit at the sushi bar! Taking with Saki the owner we have never ordered from the sushi menu and he dazzles us every time."}
{"text":"5 stars for food, 2 stars for service

The sushi is fresh and amazing.  All of their rolls have delicious sauces.  But, you MUST sit at the sushi bar.  If you decide to sit at a table (there is usually a long wait), the waitresses are pretty rude.  They rush you to order as soon as your butt hits the chair.  Once you finish dining, they will push you to pay and get out of the table so they can seat other parties.

So, if you want to enjoy your meal, sit at the sushi bar (which doesn't have many chairs, so a party of 3 is probably the largest)."}
{"text":"We came in for dinner on a Saturday night (party of 5) - we waited over 30 minutes for the table and another 10 minutes for the menu. 

They mix up my friend's order and my steak dinner was dry and over cooked. The food was very slow to come (we spent over 2 hours there).

I don't see how can you give 5 stars to this restaurant? Food was just OK and the service was marginal. Not again for me."}
{"text":"The food is good but I do not understand how no one has addressed how slow and disorganized they are here. Still sitting here an hour later and we haven't gotten all of our food. Staggering is one thing but the first two came out after about 20 minutes, the third after 40 minutes and still no sight of the fourth. We've asked to close out and cancel the forth and there wasn't even an acknowledgement or apology for the wait. No prices for most of the rolls on the menu either and they don't itemize the bill. The table next to us was overcharged. Hopefully this is a bad night for this small business because the experience has not been a good one and I'd hate to see them go out of business because they're not adequately staffed."}
{"text":"This is the freshest sashimi I have ever had! The staff is so friendly. The rolls are amazing. If you're coming for dinner make sure you get there right at 5 when the doors open or it gets packed. Try sitting at the sushi bar for the best experience and quick service!"}
{"text":"What a lovely, intimate place!!  Ordered sushi cause I don't get it often and assorted tempura. Both were wonderful!!  The lunch order of tempura included a wonderfully fresh salad, miso soup finished up with a scoop of ice cream. Will go back soon."}
{"text":"This place is absolutely the best sushi in the valley. No question about it! I eat here at least twice a month and love it. Probably 100 rolls on the menu and Sake (world's greatest sushi chef ever) probably has another 100 in his head!!! You must go and see for yourself. Ask for Sake and just tell him what you like and he will give you a list of rolls to try. Definitely try the Grand Canyon Roll, Phoenix Suns Roll, and the Tuna Poke for sure!!! If you want something different try the Romantic Roll, Cowboy Roll, or the Smokey and the Bandit Roll!!! Enjoy"}
{"text":"Amazing Place. We've been looking for a wonderful sushi place and we've found it. The service was great, clean, and of course the most important part... The food was delicious."}
{"text":"This place is the bomb. I will not eat sushi anywhere else now. Saki is an absolute sweetheart. No wonder the place has been around 14 years. It gets very busy on Fridays and Saturdays with a wait. It's small, but not a chain and the creativity on the rolls is amazing. We loved the primo roll, the awesome roll and the spicy ninja. The Tuna poki is to die for. Fresh tuna and salmon that just melt in your mouth. Give it a try you won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"We love the food here!  Everything from the salad dressing, soup, sushi, and entrees!  We tried everything and it just does not compare to the other Japanese places around here.  The only issue is that this place is so small so you have to get here very early before they get busy.  Wish they had a bigger restaurant."}
{"text":"Just tried this place on a whim while visiting and we couldn't have found a better place for sushi in the east valley! 

We had some great yellowtail sashimi, plus four tasty rolls. The Gilbert was our favorite followed by the shrimp lovers, the peppered salmon,  and the special soft-shell crab were all tied for second. 

The coolest part we thought was how the rolls came out at different times. Gave time to enjoy the meal and each roll individually. We got a nice treat after dinner with the ice cream and fortune cookie."}
{"text":"Came during lunch, took about 15 mins to get an order in for two people and then another 47 minutes for the actual food to come. Sushi quality was good, service and speed of food especially for an average one hour lunch break was awful."}
{"text":"Best sushi I've had in Arizona, by far. My boyfriend and I recently moved to Tempe from Gilbert and still make the trek to eat Sake's tasty creations. He knows what we like and always suggests new rolls. The service is always great too and you get free dessert at the end. Love love LOVE Temari."}
{"text":"For some reason this last year I have been starting to really enjoy sushi.. even to a point where I am requesting it on date night. My boyfriend and his family have been coming here for years so a few weeks ago, I was finally able to try this infamous place. Overall first impression: so good.

The food is perfect. That's my number one reason for giving it 5-stars is that the sushi, Udon, tempura, and edamame we got were awesome. But I will say this: the place is tiny and it can take a while to be seated on a weekend. Is it worth the wait? Yes. Just be mentally prepared before coming.

The owner, Saki, is also very friendly and will often times be at the bar making rolls as he chats with customers which is nice. Speaking of rolls, the Primo Roll is probably the best one they offer. I mean the Udon is great for non-sushi folk, but that Primo Roll is what dreams are made of...

So as far as my amateur sushi taste buds are concerned, Temari is one of the best places in the valley thus far. Just sayin'."}
{"text":"Showed up at about 6:45p, the place was  full with the exception of a couple of tables.  The sign asked for us to wait to be seated so we did just that.  The server behind the counter looked at us and that was it.  In the 5-10 min wait by the door, another lady behind the counter further down made eye contact a couple of times so I smiled at her.  All the while we are watching the server go between bussing tables and delivering food and drinks.  The service didn't look too sanitary between grabbing dirty glasses and plates then handling plates she delivered.  So we decided to leave.  I was expecting a wait after reading the reviews, however I just can't get past the level of cleanliness."}
{"text":"Competent udon and ramen noodles but the sushi was lacking.  3 star food at 4 star prices=2 star restaurant. It's... okay and that's it."}
{"text":"Might just be our new favorite sushi restaurant! The tuna poke is delicious along with all the rolls we've tried- favorites so far are the something good roll and the primo roll. Yum! So far we've only gotten take out, not dined in."}
{"text":"First time here, completely delicious, fantastically fresh and so awesome! We loved it! We sat at the bar and got great service from the chef and wait staff highly recommend to anyone that wants to try out a family friendly, casual, local sushi restaurant."}
{"text":"Amazing, we sat at the Sushi Bar and tried the Shogun Roll! OMG, we have a been looking for a a great sushi place forever!


This will NOW  be our ONLY Sushi haught!"}
{"text":"We just moved to the area and were looking for a good place to get sushi on a regular basis. We tried this place and it was decent so we went back today. We got there at 1:42 pm. We walked and and the lady yelled at us from across the room that they're closed. As we're walking out I notice that the sign says they're open until 2. I go back in to say it's not even a quarter to two and we just want a couple sushi rolls. The lady laughs at me and say no we're closed. Too bad because this place had potential, but never a good thing to not be open during posted business hours and to be disrespectful to customers. Unfortunately never going back!"}
{"text":"I have been coming here since 2007 and If I could give a hundred stars I would!
Sit at the bar and meet Saki, Danny and the whole team,then if you are feeling adventurous order a
Tuna POKE #10!!  
Iced green tea, and any special roll they can make! This place is the number 1 sushi place I have ever been too and will continue to stay a loyal customer"}
{"text":"The food was excellent! I haven't had better sushi than this. The primo is my new favorite roll."}
{"text":"We love Temari!  The tuna poke is absolutely addictive - we always order a heat level of 6, and my mouth is on FIRE by the time we're through.  There is an endless variety of creative and interesting sushi rolls, too.  Our favorites are the Primo Roll and the Hot and Saucy, but every roll we've tried is delicious.  The only thing is, the prices aren't on the menu, and the tuna is \"market priced\", so it can sometimes be a bit shocking when you receive the check and find out how much those rolls (and poke) actually set you back.  Because of this, we don't go as often as we'd like to, but man - it's sure worth every penny when we do get there.  Sushi heaven!"}
{"text":"Best sushi I've had in AZ. Wait times can be long and the small restaurant can get packed, but it's worth it. Huge selection of rolls and im always left satisfied."}
{"text":"We really like this place. We loved all our rolls so much that my wife didn't wait till dinner ended to start texting her friends. We ordered the calamari and while it wasn't bad we recommend skipping it and ordering another roll. Also depending on when you go  you may have to wait just a little bit. There is a good amount of seating for the size of the restaurant but it is evident this place is in high demand."}
{"text":"This place is great!  We were seated quickly and the server was very prompt on drinks, orders, etc.  We ordered 4 sushi rolls and they came out one at a time (I don't know if this was intentional or just a slow kitchen).  At first I didn't think I would like them coming out individually, but it ended up adding to our night.  By coming out one at a time we could focus on each roll and what we liked about each one.  When they come all at once it's hard to remember which one had that sauce you liked.  
We ordered the Primo, Pretty in Pink, Rainbow, tuna Sashimi and the Something Bad roll.  Our faves were the Pretty in Pink and Primo, but all the rolls were great.  I would go back here again and again if the service and food are this good each time.  It was a little dark and hard to read the menu."}
{"text":"Great ambiance! 

This is a small hole in the wall sushi restaurant and I'd call it a gem in this desert land. 

They have sooooo many selections of rolls and it's a bit overwhelming but thanks to Yelp, we didn't need to read everything on the sushi roll menu. 

The tuna Poke was pretty good. 

We've tried the \"Nothing Roll\" which is good if you don't like all the extra sauce. 

Also, a lot of the rolls mentioned on other reviews weren't on the menu, which was very disappointing! like the \"Garlic Lover's Roll\", \"Amazing Grace Roll\", and \"Baja Roll\" :( 

I'll have to come back to try the other rolls. It's definitely far from the best I've had but it's definitely worth the visit!"}
{"text":"I just started liking sushi about a month ago. Late bloomer, I guess. My husband and I don't like raw sushi though. The second time we came here, the sushi chef pointed out that we always order the cooked rolls and recommended the primo roll. I'd seen it on here with wonderful reviews. He mentioned that he could make it with cooked fish. We took his word and ordered it on Tuesday night. Oh. My. God. It was delicious. I'll order it every time we go there now. And the gyoza? So delish! This quickly became one of my favorite restaurants. When we were leaving on Tuesday he mentioned that he can substitute like this with any roll on the ginormous menu. That makes this even more amazing! I am on love with Temari!!!"}
{"text":"Wow, well move over my former #1 sushi spot - Temari just bumped you!

So my friend didn't feel like driving \"all the way over\" (5 whole miles) to our regular spot and mentioned Temari and based on the reviews we decided to give it a whirl.  SSSSsoooooo glad we did!

Nice atmosphere, kind of reminded us of a NY restaurant, long & not very wide, full of good food and conversation.  Our waitress was very nice and  helpful.  Average prices for the most part, although we gorged ourselves silly and the bill was testament to that!

I was a little leery about the huge amount of rolls they had on the menu, but we sampled 6 or 7 different ones and enjoyed them all.  LOVED a few.  The Hot & Saucy and Primo rolls were our absolute favorites, the former highly recommended by a lady sitting nearby.  Both were nice and spicy and fresh, well made and so damn tasty. 

Their chili sauce and garlic sauce rock, and contrasted nicely with another roll we got that had a lemony sauce.  They have a large variety of rolls from savory to spicy and a few on the sweeter side.  If they do them all as well as the ones we tried, kudos to them.  The sashimi tasted fresh to us and was nicely done as well, we had some different tunas and unagi, they were all good.

Now I just have to find more sushi buddies so I can go often!!  Oh and another bonus, less kids than at other places we've been  :)"}
{"text":"This is some of the best sushi I've had and thats including the sushi and sashimi I had in Japan. When anyone asks where to get good sushi this is hands down the place I always recommend. The Primo and Golden Gate rolls will keep you coming back here!"}
{"text":"Found this on here late Sunday night and thought It looked good. Pleasant to find this small family owned sushi restaurant. The food was excellent  sushi was fresh and well prepared. I went with the recommended rolls by Mr. Saki who was the chef and owner. They were spot on for what I like in a sushi roll. His conversation was as great as the food. I will definitely be back to try the extensive menu of sushi."}
{"text":"Always been a great experience dining at Temari, Danny and Saki have always been more than gracious and friendly.  They always advise you of new rolls or specials they have for the evening.  

There is nowhere else I  the valley that has sushi in the unique way they do,  it's delicious and fresh,  flavorful and generous portions.  This place isn't skimpy like Ra or Kona, they also aren't the trendy hipster type environment either,  they have a friendly, family style atmosphere that keeps you coming back again and again.  

Be advised Friday and Saturday nights are crowded and you will have to wait but good,  fresh food takes time,  there is no 2 ways about it. 

This hidden gem is always worth the wait."}
{"text":"It's my favorite sushi place in the east valley. The roll selection is amazing and unique. And, if you ask him, Saki will make you something not on he menu. The ginger bomb roll is a new creation that is not on the menu, and it has just been added to my favorite list. Best place for rolls in all of Phoenix."}
{"text":"very good fresh sushi!  definately will be back! very clean and friendly staff.  the sushi rolls were delicious and very fresh!  was even served a small bowl of complimentary ice cream!  yummy!"}
{"text":"Out of state , found this place on yelp, figured I'd try some Arizona sushi, place was pretty good , fish was fresh, service was great, portions were Very decent. A tad too much garlic in the sauce that was put on the albacore, other than that, can't complain . Don't live here , but if I come back, I would eat here again !!give it a try, it's not a big place, and filled up as there appears to be a lot of regulars dining there..."}
{"text":"I can't believe I didn't know about this place when I live less than a mile away. They are right next to Urban Exchange and have been around for 14 years! You can tell that it's everyone is a regular. I've been around the block for sushi and this is by far the most creative, yummy spot I ve been. Not only do I love supporting locally owned businesses but it's a double win when it's amazing. I will never go to Ra' or Blue Wasabi ever again. Really amazing. Good food. Good vibes. Oh and cool background music - 80's baby!"}
{"text":"I've been here twice after a recommendation for their ramen. Both times were disappointing because I couldn't get what wanted to order even though it was in the menu. I wanted the Cha-Su Ramen, but was told they were out of the stuff, meaning the pork. I found very suspicious that both visits they were out even though they just opened for the day. So I ended up getting the Soyu Ramen. Which is pretty plain anyways, but should not have been as plain as I got it. First time it only had half boiled egg and one small pink fish cake, then second time they gave no egg and one small fish cake the size of a quarter. WTF!!! That's why I stopped coming to this restaurant because if you can't or won't give your customer what they ordered or what's on the menu then no more of my business. Sushi maybe good but sushi places are dime a dozen here. 

If you only want to concentrate on the sushi because that is your bulk business and moneymaker, then get rid of the ramen from your menu."}
{"text":"Temari is a decent sushi place in a strip mall in Gilbert. It wasn't amazing, but we had a solid dinner and I'm comfortable going there again... with one caveat - skip the sashimi and stick to fancy rolls! 

We decided to try Temari after reading some Yelp reviews and getting a recommendation from a friend of mine. We came on a Monday night so it was quiet and we had no wait to get a table. I counted and there are only 10 tables in the restaurant, so I totally understand why there could be a long wait on a weekend.

I love sashimi more than any other type of sushi. If it's high quality, I have been known to eat an entire meal of only sashimi! We ordered tuna, yellowtail and salmon sashimi. Sad to say but they were not good. Edible, but not tasty, nothing special, definitely not worth the price. There are other sushi places in the Valley with good sashimi so I won't have to order sashimi here again. We also tried three fancy rolls - Primo roll (AMAZING), Las Vegas roll (good), and the special soft-shell crab roll (also good). The menu probably had 50 different rolls so there is certainly something for everyone.

At the end of the meal, everyone gets a tiny scoop of icecream with a homemade fortune cookie on top! I really loved this - who can say no to complementary dessert?!

Bottom line: come during the week to avoid the crowds, skip sashimi and nigiri, and only order the rolls! 

TL;DR.... 3/5 stars due to disappointing sashimi; would return again for specialty rolls; go during the week to avoid the wait; free dessert"}
{"text":"YAY for lunch served on a sushi \"BOAT\".

The Boat Special (or whatever it's called) includes a little sushi, sashimi, and salad and teriyaki whatever you like.

I personally think teriyaki sauce is too sweet, so I'll probably order it without sauce next time, but if you like teriyaki, you'll probably like it.

Everything was fresh and the service was decent.

Looking forward to more!"}
{"text":"The sushi chef was ugly but the food was awesome.  Definitely a five star restaurant!"}
{"text":"This is definitely one of my favorite sushi places! I get the same thing every single time I go, & I swear it tastes just as great as it did the first time I went, 4 years ago! I always start off with the tuna poke, then order the double 007 and primo roll and im set!! I don't know what they put in their sauces for their rolls but they are extremely addicting! Only downside is this place is really small, so if you are going in with a large party, I would recommend calling ahead to make sure there is room.. And their servers aren't very attentive, very scattered, unfortunately, especially when busy, eventhough its only like 5 tables and the sushi bar. But over all great place and reasonable price."}
{"text":"I was so excited to try this place after ALL amazing reviews... But sadly, I was very disappointed! The sushi menu is very extensive but kinda seemed like it was a lot of the same items and the special sushi rolls on the chalk board were not described anywhere, which was frustrating. The regular had like 3 items on it and was a let down too. And lastly, even if the food was amazing the service was  anything but."}
{"text":"The food was ok. I ordered the tonkatsu ramen. The flavor was good but it was very simple. I wish they added more toppings to their ramen. Overall, it had a good taste but was \"boring\" as far as ramen's go."}
{"text":"I love Temari, awesome service and the chefs there talk with to to understand your experience with sushi and what you like/dislike. I tried somewhere else tonight and I realized I needed to write a review for Temari's because this other place did not meet our exceed my expectations. With Temari's you get good portions that are not oversized and they don't use a lot of cheap \"crab\" meat/salad. I will write a review later for the other place but I won't recommend them for sushi. If you are in the Phoenix area Danny and Saki are the guys to go to fit you studio needs, Temari had been there for 15 years and they are passionate about making excellent food and satisfying their clients."}
{"text":"Excellent rolls, Nigeria, and sashimi.  Service is awesome. The place just rocks and the recipes are very good. I highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"Hubby and I used to come here all the time and we've always had good experiences. Lately when I've been on that side of town and wanted sushi, I'd go to Temari, remembering how good it used to be.

Not anymore -- I made excuses for their decline in standards.

I'm not sure if that sushi chef was being trained, etc, but the rolls were a bit off -- they fell apart easily and the fish just didn't taste as fresh as I remember it being. The rice for the sushi tended to fall apart far too easily -- that was pissing me off. I had more rice in my soy sauce dipping bowl than on the actual sushi roll itself. Yea, I was pretty peeved, but that was nothing compared to what had happened minutes before...

Their sushi menu is a bit confusing as well. I am used to a menu where you can check things off on the left hand side of the column, not the far right. I made the mistake of checking the box off to the left, thinking I was ordering california rolls and an eel roll. Imagine my surprise when sashimi arrived instead of nigiri.

They charged me for my mistake. It was an honest mistake and frankly, I love sashimi, but I've recently had a bad experience with sashimi in California that left me feeling like I was hovering close to death...I was in zero mood for raw fish. What should have cost me about $18 in sushi ended up being $30 for my mistake...lunch there used to cost me somewhere between $15-$20, including tip. When all was said and done, the bill was $42 for 2 people...and my cousin hadn't even ordered sushi!

My cousin had ordered the chicken teriyaki which she said tasted like they had just straight out added corn flour to soy sauce. She said she'd never had a bigger salt lick in her life. The chicken was overcooked and the only thing I *think* she enjoyed was the salad on her plate...oh and the rice that came with the meal.

The end of the meal came with complimentary ice cream -- as if that could make me think about coming back here again.

The service was fine, but I found the tables a bit sticky...like they didn't wipe it down well enough. I had forgotten how cramped it felt in there until I stepped through the doors.

Sayonara Temari...you lost a once faithful customer. I discovered Sakana and Four Seasons."}
{"text":"Primo roll is amazing!!!
Definitely coming back. Next time I'm ordering multiple. Love the complimentary ice cream at the end!"}
{"text":"Yum! Temari does sushi right! They have other items on their menu, but I've only had their sushi. The flavors in each roll are so unique, we ordered 3 rolls: spicy tuna, lollipop roll and their version of a volcano roll. 

We have never tasted anything as good as these rolls. Very fresh fish, amazing taste, and the service was very nice too.

The place is pretty small, so expect a tight squeeze, but definitely worth while."}
{"text":"First time here, and we would come back! Great sushi and great service. We had sake and the Awesome rolls. They were definitely awesome! The place is small and there seemed to be a lot of regulars there which is a good sign."}
{"text":"I often hear the phrase \"let me take you to this restaurant, it has the best -------.\"  However, this time my friends really came through. I am always wary of the term best sushi, best restaurant, best this or that. However this facility definitely has the best sushi I've had in Arizona.  Hands-down. No argument. Located in a discreet location in a strip mall, the outside facade looks nothing special. Upon entering, you do see the fresh fish at the counters and the typical decore of a sushi restaurant. 

Wanting to initially try out their seafood with as little gimmicks as possible, we started off with the poke. What a great choice, the fish melted in my mouth. Soft, delicate,  great texture, great color, excellent presentation. Next, we ordered three of their 90+ rolls. Normally, I am not a cream cheese fan in my rolls, however they use very small amounts. It actually mixed in surprisingly well with all of the rolls. Being the Yelp addict that I am, I like to take photos of what I order in order to post them. However, these rolls looked so delicious I forgot to take pictures of over half of our meal.

I can't wait to come back numerous times."}
{"text":"Have eaten here twice. Both times I was a little...how do I say it...underwhelmed.  Fish just not quite as fresh as it I've found it at other places. Rolls not quite as tight, or interesting as other places I go to regularly....like Sakana.  

In this part of town there aren't many places to get sushi, so it's convenient but not where I'd bring a date.  More of a...I need a quick sushi fix kind of place."}
{"text":"This has always been our favorite sushi place, but when we moved to South Gilbert, we found other sushi places to visit. After being disappointed with the sushi selections down south, we decided to start making the drive back to Temari. Boy, did I miss this place. I have NEVER had a roll that I didn't like. The Amazing Grace roll is one of my favorites. The staff is ALWAYS friendly, including the very attentive sushi chefs. My ONLY complaint is that seating is extremely limited. Plan on waiting if you go during normal dinner time. If you like extremely plain sushi, this might not be your place. But if you like sushi with multiple flavors exploding in your mouth at once, you will love this place!"}
{"text":"By far the best sushi anywhere in Arizona. Get the primo roll and the baja roll (not even on the menu but it is made with tuna and mango). So delicious. 
We go here every chance we get and always take new friends!"}
{"text":"Absolutely worst sushi place! The fish was not fresh, half the things we ordered we couldn't eat and the other half we just canceled. The service was terrible. The waiters were not attentive and didn't provide any customer service!! If I could give less than one star I would."}
{"text":"This place is awesome! My sister and I went in a few weeks ago. It's small but definitely worth it. The chefs and servers were very nice saying hello and goodbye. The Primo roll was incredible. Best sushi I have had in the valley."}
{"text":"Great sushi spot - they do interesting combinations - the Amazing Grace roll in particular really stood out. They also serve a complimentary scoop of icecream and a fortune cookie at the end of the meal. Slightly pricey, but good nonetheless."}
{"text":"It is ridiculously AMAZING!!! The staff is soooooo friendly and the food matches their personalities!  

Try the primo roll, amazing grace, and when Saki or Danny ask you if you want to try a new roll (if you sit at the sushi bar) just say YES!!!!"}
{"text":"In brief this is a great sushi find somewhat tucked away in a very innocuous shopping center in Gilbert.  The sushi was fresh and the price was very reasonable.  There aren't a ton of tables inside but the wait is well-worth doing."}
{"text":"Greatest place to get sushi. Definitely get your money's worth. Makes it really hard to get sushi any where else."}
{"text":"I can't say enough good things about this place!  Not only is the sushi amazing, but the atmosphere and friendly service always remind us why we love it here.  Saki at the sushi bar is very welcoming had helpful when choosing new rolls to try.  Try the Primo and AZ rolls, you won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"Excellent, fresh tasting and high-grade quality sushi!  I'm a fan.  It's small, intimate, with great friendly service and the customers there all seem to be regulars.  There are 3 huge pages full of different rolls and options. Also, I loved the touch of strawberry ice cream with fortune cookie served at the end of the meal:) Perfect ending!"}
{"text":"My pregnant friend and I ate here with our kids today , and I was running little late.  I asked her to order me my food since we were rushing to Goto a movie later...

My friend is 8 month pregnant and when she told the waiteress table for 4, they just made her stand and told her she can't be seated till everyone was there.

Now I understand restaurant is small and not many tables and it was prime dinner time... 

But seriously making a 8 month pregnant women stand ? As a women I'm pretty ashamed for them. 


They could have easily asked her to wait and sit at the to go counter if it was such a big deal but they just let her stand there... 

Guess they only care for the regulars they have which for small business I guess that's ok but wowwww! Even people that just sat there and watched is so inconsiderate and this shames Asian cultures especially known to be considerate Japanese culture ( yes I'm from japan)"}
{"text":"You gotta get the Tuna Pokie !!!!!!   Awesomely delicious."}
{"text":"Worst customer service I've ever experienced. I'm not sure if it's because there's a language barrier or if the staff here just generally does not care about taking care of their customers. I did not like what I ordered which has never happened here before. When I tried to talk to my server about it, she was very standoffish and dismissive. I told her I didn't care for it her only response was didn't you read the description of what you ordered? When I asked for something else she says I don't think so and walked away. I grab the attention of a different server and informed her that I wasn't happy with what I ordered and she says the same thing well didn't you read what you ordered? I've told her it doesn't matter if I read it or not if I order something here and I don't like it I should be able to order something else. She then tells the manager who then tells her to tell me, never even comes up to me to talk about this himself, that we won't be charged.  I wasn't looking for a free meal I just wanted a meal in general! I asked the server again if I could just get something else and she told me I don't think so. So even though I didn't have to pay for my meal, I left there hungry and extremely upset. Never in my life have I dined a restaurant that didn't allow you to order something else if you didn't like your meal. I can't believe I was treated this way. It's as if they were basically telling me we don't like you don't never come back. Because that's exactly what's going to happen I'm never going back. There are way too many places in the Eastvalley that serve great sushi and great service. This place is not worth the headache."}
{"text":"Best I've had in a long time. Sit at the bar and enjoy the show. Ask for the man in charge. Sakeman!!!"}
{"text":"Saki and Danny just do it better than anyone else. Every roll is hand-crafted and delicious. Saki creates his own sauces. This has been our only sushi place for four years."}
{"text":"Fun resteraunt, extremely good sushi. Very limited seating and fills up fast. Get there early or expect a wait. The sushi chefs are very friendly. Well worth the wait!"}
{"text":"I don't even know if I have the right words to express just how AWESOME this place is!!! The food is incredible, so if you are looking for a sushi place that you can count on to satisfy, here it is!!! Highly recommend x 1 million ;)"}
{"text":"This place has the best sushi hands down!!
Get the hawain 5.0 and the primo!! They are life changing"}
{"text":"We came across this place on a sat evening. We must of lucked out as there was no waiting. My wife ordered the shrimp tempura and I ordered the ninja roll and tako sashimi. The rolls were amazing - very delicious and very reasonably priced. The sashimi was very fresh. I look forward to trying this place again. Maybe during happy hour, as the specials were priced very low. As we sat at the sushi bar, the owner chatted it up with us. He's a very friendly and  likable guy."}
{"text":"When I go to a new place, I order all of my usuals to see if the food is any good.  I spent a little more money than I wanted to because I wanted to see if I would ever come back or not.  With all the money my wife and I spent - We were not disappointed.  The place was clean and there was tons of people.  They keep the place packed and you can tell everyone there is happy.

My wife's miso soup came out first - definitely the best anywhere.  Kabuki Tempi I would say second.

Then the Tuna Poke with 7 Heat rating came out - What a monster Salad.  By the other reviewers images I expected a 1/4 of the size we received.  This was awesome awesome!  I think next time I will go with a 4 Heat rating even thought I could have handled the 10.  I just like to focus more on the flavor of the tuna over the heat.  

My wife's Chicken Teriyaki came out - all white meat with a great sauce.  The salad and salad dressing were top quality as well.

My Spicy Tuna came out - Kabuki Tempi has always been the best and I think still is, but nothing has been a close second.  This place was a close second.

My Dragon Roll - Higher quality than any other dragon roll I ever had.  It was awesome.  I think next time I will try the caterpillar roll because I like more avocado. 

I think this place may now be my favorite place after going just one time.  I think it is the Tuna Poke that puts this place over the top.  Try it, you wont be disappointed."}
{"text":"its hard to find a good sushi place in phoenix.
so this place is not an exception. they do have tons of rolls menu, but not very creative.
majority of the rolls are made almost identical to the rest of the rolls. - cream cheese, tempura. what's up with that.
the rice. this place also did not get the rice right. over kill with the rice vinegar + sugar. yea. sugar. I can still taste it. terrible when you eat the rice with over power taste of vinegar and sugar. and then, they use a lot of sweet sauce (unagi sauce) to make the food taste like chocolate cake (very sweet in a way) and one of the item they use tons of mayo."}
{"text":"Updated: after going back several times with my father to try the other types off ramen that is listed on their menu, we were told everytime that it was not available. So when we would order the ramen that was available, it was just noodles and broth. It did not include any of the extras listed \"on their menu.\" So tired of the bs. Thankfully, we were able to find other places 10 times better."}
{"text":"Kamari is a hidden gem among sushi restaurants. You can't find better tasting rolls anywhere. The chef, Saki, is literally a wizard when it comes to his sauces. I have yet to introduce someone to this restaurant and not have them love everything that we have ordered. One word of caution though, don't order the traditional roles you order else where. always ask one of the two chefs what they would recommend. They have an uncanny ability of making your pallet incredibly happy. Five stars is truly not high enough for me. Well done, Saki."}
{"text":"Phenomenal... that is all that needs to be said about Temaris and the deliciousness that they serve up. From their traditional food menu to their ridiculously awesome sushi - we love this place."}
{"text":"We LOVE this sushi place and we have tried different ones all over the valley.  This one if our favorite.  Try the Tuna Pokey...pick a low number unless you like it spicy!
Also great rolls are the Primo Roll. Best seller. The spicy ninja is a great for a little spice in your roll.  Finishes with some creamy strawberry ice cream."}
{"text":"Found this on Yelp by accident yesterday, We have searched for a near by quality / good service sushi bar (real fish) raw stuff sashimi, wink wink. We live 7 minutes from the gem hiding  right under our noses!  For some reason when I searched and searched it never showed up. We had nearly given up! We have a go to place, but it's a long drive with Snow birds and traffic, so we jumped in, said a sushi prayer, We were cautious, and Wow! We had a lovely time. I gave up rice  3 weeks ago, I had some amazing ideas , and I had a great collaboration with Danny (sushi chef extrodinaire) Fish was fresh, best quality, generous in portion size,  I had some hand rolls no rice, and together we worked on making them delish!  the bill was less then expected, and we received a little treat for desert, It is quaint, and they have pics on the wall of regular costomers, This might sound bad,but thank goodness so many near by places are  awful! finding this gem wasn't easy, better late than never! I enjoy good service mixed with good food. I didn't need a beer to feel a buzz this place made me feel at home!

Thanks to the entire staff, (and it's true, Friday night fills up fast, we got their just after opening, and we were not disappointed in any of it. I knew people somewhere took pride in food, and service at a sushi bar! I am so glad we found them, Maybe I shouldn't post this, hate to fight people for a seat LOL  All joking aside, you will not be disappointed. Hurray!"}
{"text":"Outstanding!!! The best sushi I have had, and I have tried a fair number across the US. We take all our friends there, and they are blown away. They then become regulars. There are a lot of rolls to choose from, and it can be a bit intimidating. The Green Apple is the best. Also love the Amazing Grace. Primo is very popular. Never had a bad roll. Sake (not the drink) is awesome, and great with recommendations and accommodating my no cream cheese request. He truly is a master of his craft. And love the 80s music. JD"}
{"text":"Love Love Love Temari! My sister lives right accross the street from this place and we always try to meet up here for lunch!  Been going here for 3 years now, seriously, nothing fancy but the best sushi!  

My work takes me to some of the best restaurants in town, but I LOVE the idea of going to Temari, casual, relaxing and just plain good food!"}
{"text":"This is my favorite place for sushi on the planet. The fish is flown in several times per week.  I'm a little bummed when I read negative reviews on Saki and his staff and their food. I guess I just feel a bit protective since I love these guys and their food. That being said, I suppose your experience really depends on what you prefer and what you order. I have a set of rolls and sashimi that I get almost every time and they are huge winners for my guests (this being my go to place for my AZ visitors).  If you order these items and you think they are no good then I suppose you and I are just at an impasse... But to each his own. But trust me. If you can only eat a few items then go with the Poke Tune and the Primo roll. 

Here they are:

Poke Tuna 5 ( it's rated 1-10 in spice. Most of my friends like mild so I go for a 5. I get this as the appetizer. I crave it daily. So so so good)
Sumo
Tucson
Pretty in pink (kinda of a dessert roll. We usually eat it last)
Primo (favorite. This turns out to be everyone's favorite. Order 2)
Green apple (next favorite. no wasabi)
Phoenix suns
Sunkist (very citrusy. If you don't like Lemmon zest you won't like this) 
Hawaii 5-0 (one if my best friends helped saki name this one. It's great and has a nice mango Hawaiian flare).

I don't like wasabi sauce so i have Saki hold it from all the rolls. 

I brought in a Russian the other day who worked in Tokyo for a while. She was blown away in how good it was and she remarked that it was the best she ever tasted... Albeit it's not exactly the same type of sushi... We Americans tend to prefer slightly Americanized Japanese food. 

My biggest gripe with sushi at other places is the fish smells like... Well... Fish. A good sushi place should NEVER smell like fish. Fresh sushi fish should smell mild and fresh. Also, OLD fish will often have a iridescence cast to it in certain lights. Let these two things be a benchmark for your sushi eating. Saki uses very fresh fish... Perhaps the most fresh you can have in AZ."}
{"text":"My cousin and were craving some Japanese food and decided to give this place a try. We got a seat at the sushi bar and ordered the White Dragon Roll and the Cowgirl Roll. Speciality sushis range around 12 dollars but I definitely recommend it, it's worth it!

The White Dragon Roll was so amazing, didn't need any extra sauce, it was delicious and never had anything like it. I recommend it to those who like sushi smothered in sauce though, definitely amazing. 

Cowgirl roll had beef chunks on top and had such a unique kick to it. It already had wasabi inside so not much extra was needed. ALSO DELICIOUS! 

Had the regular udon as well and I thought it was amazing. 

Definitely recommend this place! Will be coming back. :)"}
{"text":"I'm not big on sushi but my friends LOVE it. They say this place is legit. I did try the California roll, it was pretty good. But so is the teriyaki chicken!!! Kinda hidden & not a lot of seating but was a fun place for lunchtime sushi celebrating our kids going back to school!"}
{"text":"Without a doubt nobody is wrong in their reviews of Temari. Tell them what you like, if you like spicy, whatever. Don't be shy, ask questions.  They make your order to the way you like it.
Look, I've always been in the fence about sushi, could take it or leave it. Temari will from now on, be one in my top 5 favorites."}
{"text":"I've been eating at this sushi restaurant for years and I have never been disappointed. Of course, my favorite is Chirashi Sushi. It is fairly expensive as it is many different kinds of sashimi on a bed of sticky rice and you need a big Appetite, is difficult to finish there is so much of it. All of it, very fresh, all of it delightful. I highly recommend it to a others. It also doesn't hurt to acknowledge the service with a very polite thank you and please in Japanese. I've never had a bad experience with them at all."}
{"text":"Friendly service (although on the slow side).  Their fish is fresh and probably the best in Chandler/Gilbert.   That given it is very sad that they do not serve Uni or Toro because they can't sell enough to keep fresh stock on demand.  This area is definitely not known for sushi.  The items they sell most are rolls loaded with sauce and cream cheese - not authentic sashimi or nigiri.  In the SF Bay Area or LA or Vegas this place would be 2 or 3 star at best.  However since sushi choice here is limited, this is one of the better place so I'm giving them 4 stars."}
{"text":"The Primo Roll is the best sushi roll ever created by mankind! I highly recommend it!"}
{"text":"Super good. Everything we ordered was amazing. We walked in and there was a group Japanese people there and they recommended some dishes for us. Sushi was super good too. Will be going back."}
{"text":"Absolutely delicious. Tried a couple of rolles suggested to us be fellow patrons, and we were not disappointed! The primo roll was fantastic! The sushi chef was so nice and talented! He is willing to customize anything you want. Younlike it spicy? He will spice it up! You want crunchy? He will add crunch! Loved it! We enjoyed oirbdate night there very much and will be back soon to try more rolls! Yum!"}
{"text":"OK, this review was because of Jeremy P. 11/29/2012. Except for the Shimagamo comment which I don't agree...

I DON\"T NEED TO WRITE A REVIEW because he said everything to a T. I could of not gone to a dirtier looking place that I thought I would actually get sick off the cracked wood blocks. Jeremy P. said everything I would of said: EXACTLY. I will cut and past for those who can't find his review, here goes:

\"In how many different ways can you arrange the same ten ingredients?  If this were a contest, Temari would win, hands down.

This looked like one of the most promising places in a very generic East Valley sushi scene, so we decided to give it a shot.  When I sat down, our eager waiter asked me what I'd like to drink.  I asked him if they only have fountain sodas, and he looked at me like I was speaking Greek.  I said, \"What do you have, bottles?\"  He said they don't have cans or anything; it just comes out of a gun.  So... Fountain sodas then.  Got it.

My friend said his Mr. Pibb tasted off, and asked to switch to Coke.  He said sure, but he'll have to pay for the Coke.

Now, on to the food.... I looked at the menu.  I saw about three pages of rolls.  I looked at the specials board.  More rolls.  Looked at the regular menu.... Standard Japanese fare.  They have teriyaki.  TERIYAKI!  Who eats teriyaki?  This isn't Samurai Sam's, is it?

They have some sashimi.  All very standard cuts of fish.  Tuna, white tuna, salmon, yellowtail, sea bass, and mackerel is probably all they had.  Maybe the weakest selection I've seen, well, anywhere.  The nigiri sushi (which I'm pretty sure I heard our waiter pronounce as \"NIGH gi ri\" sushi to the diners at the next table) was pretty standard as well.  Ra has better selection.  Yes, that's right, Ra, one of the most notoriously generic sushi restaurants in the world, has a better selection of fish than Temari!

Anyways, at about six different points while I was looking through the tome they call a \"specials menu\" (which consists of about 99.5% rolls, plus tuna poke), our eager waiter asked us if we know what we would like yet.  Sorry, bro, can't you see I'm reading here!  I'm like half way through!  My eyes are getting tired from reading the words \"spicy tuna,\" \"eel sauce,\" and \"chili sauce\" so much!  Because 75% of the rolls have one of more of those ingredients!

It was amazing how many different rolls they had, yet how few of them actually sounded appealing.  Most of them seemed to be more focused on sauces and spice than actual fish flavor.  It's like people who eat sushi in Gilbert don't want to taste the awful flavor of fish!  Gross, right!  Fish, ugh!  I pointed out to my friend that one particular roll \"has like three sauces: chili sauce, eel sauce, garlic citrus sauce, and kiwi sauce. Four sauces!\" (imagine the Spanish Inquisition.)

Anyways, about our actual order: we went with the \"chef's choice\" sashimi platter, a romantic roll (cucumber with a bunch of stuff inside), a sunkist roll (some fish completely drowned in citrus flavor), and amaebi and quail egg sushi.  I think \"chef's choice\" means \"cheapest,\" because no real sushi chef would put both tuna and salmon on his own plate if he were picking what he wanted to eat.  The sashimi itself was OK I guess.  The rolls were very boring, as we expected.  The sweet shrimp was good, but you can tell what type of clientele they have when they placed the heads on our table, and the diners at the next table over seemed awestruck by the fact that someone would actually eat a shrimp head, what with those cute little eyeballs staring at them.

This brings me to the conclusion of this review: this place utterly destroyed our hope of finding a good sushi bar in the East Valley.  Shimogamo was respectable, but even there, the owner was unable to keep the best cuts of fish in stock because he had no confidence his clientele would buy enough of it to keep it fresh.  This is the East Valley.  People think sushi is a bunch of rolls.  You ask an East Valley denizen about their favorite sushi place, and they say, \"I like this place, they have great rolls!\"  Only here can a sushi bar stock just seven cuts of fish, and just offer 500 rolls with the same ten ingredients, and maybe serve some teriyaki chicken for those who REALLY hate sushi, and be successful.

I think we're going to look for the East Valley sushi bar with the lowest yelp rating, because that one is probably the best.  At least they didn't end up charging us for that extra Coke.

Addendum: I was just reminded about the fortune cookie they served with dessert.  A fortune cookie!  At a Japanese Restaurant!  On the back of the fortune it said \"Learn Chinese.\"  Not making this up. « show less \"

Sorry for coping your review BUT I couldn't of said it better!!!!!"}
{"text":"I have posted a review before but this is a continuation of my awesome experience. I went in last night for dinner with a friend and contrary to the other times I had been there only one table occupied when there is usually a wait. The storms must have kept everyone home. This made last nights experience incredible. Saki the chef had extra time on his hands due to the slow night and made a ginger sauce to experiment on a new roll. I was still waiting on my friend and we we had an extensive conversation about sushi and he was telling me about it and he started asking me what I like in my sushi and how I liked it. I like the standard shrimp salmon tuna cream cheese jalapeño. So he came up with what we named the Ginger Bomb Roll. I say we cause we tossed names back and forth.And it is because it was based on the sauce and cause it was the bomb!!! We had the spicy version of it. I have had amazing sushi all over the country and this by far is my favorite special roll ever. They flavors are out of this world. Not on the menu request it."}
{"text":"I DO NOT like Sushi so I cannot give an honest, accurate review of Temari's Sushi,  however my hubby adores the stuff so we go to Temari's often! 

What I would like to tell you about is some of the items off the regular menu...  

The Teriyaki Beef Rocks 
The Karaage Chicken Rocks
The Chicken Katsu Rocks
The Salad Dressing is the best in town!!!  

So there you have it if you are a NON Sushi eater & want to go to dinner with a Sushi Lover... Go Here. 

Side note
My hubby always orders the same 3 things:

Tuna Poke  ( #8 Heat Factor)
Primo Roll 
and the Val Vista Roll
He also loves the Fish over Rice Sampler Platter  (Nigiri?)

The Staff here is Great 
Go during the week 
Sit at the Sushi Bar"}
{"text":"We ate here and thought it was definitely some of the best sushi we have ever had here in AZ. The primo and play boy rolls were some of the favorites that we tried. The sushi chef is very creative and always inventing new rolls which is really cool. We talked to a couple sitting besides us and they have been following the sushi chef around the valley for the past 20 years. Next time I want to try the sushi roll with apple in it. The only downside for us was that many of the rolls have jalapenos in them and we are not ones for too spicy but other than that this place is amazing!!!"}
{"text":"Simple, to the point. Food was fresh and well prepared. No frills, not fancy. Lots of choice. Should be on your list of regular places to visit."}
{"text":"My husband and I ordered 3 rolls (Paradise, Val Vista, Dragon) all of which were AWESOME. BIG, FRESH, and loaded with great taste combos. The long roll menu (3 pages!) has good descriptions of rolls.  Bill came to $49 for 3 rolls,1 sashimi, 2 appetizers, 2 fountain drinks.

It was happy hour 5-6 so the appetizers were BOGO.  We ordered edemame and some teriyaki chicken to give to our toddler.  I like my edemame with more salt - but it was hot and yummy.

Great friendly service. Fast to refill. Server brings complimentary raspberry ice cream with the check! yea!

This will become a new go-to place for sushi for us (along with Sushi Ave).  

Only negative...no prices on roll menu and sushi bar is small and filled up (no biggie for us since we needed a highchair for the kiddo anyway).

We will be back!"}
{"text":"Came in about 7 PM last Tuesday Night 9/27.
Party of 4- place was busy, but we were offered seats right at the sushi bar.
Danny was our master chef in creating our requested sushi and offered some really gracious advise with it being our first time in! There were two   Itamae's in fact and one was the owner! Come to find out, it's a husband and wife operation ( wife seated us) & they've owned the restaurant, manage it as well for many years!
Friendly, fun atmosphere. Clean, quant, cozy place. 
Now, let's get to the food. Beautiful fresh seafood with SO MUCH to offer their customers.
We started off with the Edamame & the Seaweed Salad both were delicious!
Main dish ordered was the Tuna (Maguro) absolutely cooked to perfection, melt in your mouth mad good. It had a dark garlic sauce drizzled over. The combination of both & presentation was superior.
Ordered the Whatever Roll, that is very popular and can so see why! (Pic) Ginger Roll was just about my favorite! (See Pic)
California Roll & Spicy Tuna Roll - Great
Complementary dessert at the end of your meal- with a sweetly placed surprise fortune cookie on top. 
We found this spot do to our fellow Yelpers out there. Thanks! 
We've only lived here a year & first time venturing out to find a great sushi place. There are so many around Phoenix, but honestly after trying this place no need to bother going anywhere else! We enjoyed it that much!
Will be back soon to become \"regulars\".  Want to experience & explore more of their enormously tasty menu."}
{"text":"Good sushi. Fun place. Huge list of rolls. Let Saki pick some rolls for you. You can never go wrong here."}
{"text":"Tried the Primo, White Dragon, and Number 2 rolls.  Each very unique and saucy! DELICIOUS!!! First order is quick to come out, but warned that second order takes more time.  So order all at once if possible!  Also, the Romantic roll looked amazing...wrapped in cucumber! Will try it next time."}
{"text":"My friends are all about this place so I was excited to try it. The staff were very friendly. I ordered the pretty and pink roll and the scallop delight. I waited at least 35 minutes for my first roll while my boyfriend and son ate their sushi. Pretty in pink is not a baked roll. I saw the chefs shooting the shit with some regulars at the sushi bar. Tick tock tick tock. Did you really wait so long to start a baked roll? My family was done eating by the time I began. Mind you, we were among four tables eating including the bar couples. It was very annoying. Seeing me awkwardly sit there for so long, you'd think they'd comp the $5 soybeans... Nope. I still haven't decided if I'll be returning. The decor of the restaurant was nice but the restaurant itself is kind of small, so I don't know how well they do with groups over 4."}
{"text":"Back again & it was simply amazing...againWe LOVE the Primo, Amazing Grace, The white dragon...everything is excellent!! Saki & Danny are sushi geniuses."}
{"text":"Temari Sushi in Gilbert is the freshest in the city. I'm a picky sushi girl from Cali and this is the spot! You must try it and catch a seat at the sushi bar to enjoy great company by sushi chefs Danny and Saki! You will be hooked!"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I stopped in for dinner while on vacation in Arizona. The restaurant was small and clean. We were immediately greeted and seated upon arrival. 

We had a hard time deciding what rolls to order! The menu is extensive - I mean it! Our server was very helpful and suggested a few rolls to order. I would absolutely recommend the Primo and the Amazing Grace rolls. They were fantastic and not like traditional sushi rolls. The chef used many sauces and garnishes that really complemented the rolls. My boyfriend also ordered the Paradise Roll (sweet with cream cheese and pineapple). It was interesting and would have been better if the tempura batter was crispy. Unfortunately, it was soggy but still tasty. 

Overall, the sushi was very good. I would definitely recommend this place to anyone who wants to try great sushi with a culinary twist!"}
{"text":"they really need to update their website because they do not take reservations. I just called and they are sitting on a first come first serve basis only :("}
{"text":"This place is not very big, you have the bar that seats 9 and about 7-8 tables that fit 4 to a table. We had 7 people with 2 bigs guys and they put us on a table for 6 crammed together! We originally ask the lady that was serving drinks and cleaning tables if we may have the table behind us added and she said no. Our server notice we literally were sitting elbow to elbow and said let's grab that table next to us too. Thank god! You have to think when you order all these sushi rolls between 7 people the table will fill up pretty good. 

The tuna poke is awesome the other sushi we ordered was good nothing stuck out. The free ice cream desert with a fortune cookie was neat and really good too."}
{"text":"I really enjoyed their custom rolls.  The Cowboy had steak on top, pretty in pink had mango.  The Arizona was great.

The place is very small and gets busy quick.  Recommend you go as soon as they open at 5pm."}
{"text":"2 of us.  Back for second time.  First time, no probs. except a bit slow.

Had 50 min.  Ordered three promptly (5th minute): Primo, Ca roll and sashimi.  At the  25th minute, got Primo rolll, Very nice.  

Service all around us continued, but not at our table... We said that we were on a deadline.  45th minute, got CA roll and cancelled sashimi, boxed the CA roll. paid and were off.  The tables around us, all men, were flush with food and one came after us.    

Not good.  Another similar complaint earlier.  Are you listening?   Please fix.
With a soda, the check was almost $30. plus tip for those two rolls.  I do not stiff...  and we were hungry still."}
{"text":"Food is great here but it's too very small and can be hard to get a table.

Service is not wonderful and if you sit at the Sushi bar (don't) don't get Daniel. He has no interest in bing friendly with the customers. Meanwhile on the other side of the bar the Asian guy who I think is the owner had the people laughing and smiling. Daniel was very quiet and ignored us other than handing us our food.


We probably won't be back. Just as good of Sushi in the area and this one is a bit of a drive from Chandler."}
{"text":"First time at Temari this evening and I don't even know where to begin.  This place came highly recommended by one of my clients a few months back.  We had such a wonderful experience from start to finish.  Saki the sushi chef/owner treated us like he was our personal chef learning our likes and dislikes in fish, flavor, spiciness, etc.  He prepared us Poke, the Primo roll and Albacore sushi.  Everything from start to finish was outstanding.  Kona Grill, Blue Wasabi and chains like that will be a thing of the past for us.  We found our new sushi home."}
{"text":"The BEST SUSHI I have ever had!! And love the chef!! Always trying new rolls and each one is better then the last. The atmosphere is small, quite and cozy!!"}
{"text":"I never get tired of this place or the service! Sake and his wife are absolutely the best and the sushi is to die for. Nothing like fresh tuna in Arizona! You will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"Excellent service!  Excellent food!  My roll was delicious!  I love the vibe here.  The strawberry ice cream is wonderful!

I had the AZ roll. Their spicy tuna is actually spicy!  I must come back here. Highly recommend!  Come with an appetite!"}
{"text":"Loved the sushi?! So fresh and the home-made sauces are delicious. No need for soy sauce, wasabi or ginger (though it's provided). Primo roll was favorite!"}
{"text":"loved this place!  sat at the sushi bar by Danny, and a lovely couple sat next to us and were long time patrons.  ordered the special soft shell crab, lobster roll, scallop, primo roll, spicy ninja roll...  all were incredible, faves were the soft shell crap, and spicy ninja.  we got samples of the squid salad from our new friends and of the salmon skin roll... oh wow... salmon bacon!   very good place, but get there early!"}
{"text":"It was a good men's night out. The food was excellent. Sat at the sushi bar and let Chef Saki do his own thing. It was worth it"}
{"text":"One of my go-to places for good quality sushi. All of the other sushi places are very similar in taste and menu options, but you can tell this place is of higher quality just by having a piece of their salmon sashimi. Just phenomenol. If a plave has quality fish, you know their rolls are going to stand out. I love this place!"}
{"text":"Seriously the best sushi of my life!! I have never tasted sushi soooo good and with the savory signature sauces they create, it's a masterpiece!! You haven't lived if you haven't tried their sushi with their sauces. My favorites are 

The Primo Roll
Green Apple Roll
Amazing Grace

I will be adding more to that list because they have so many good things on the menu. I want to move back to AZ just for this sushi!"}
{"text":"Totally amazing!!!! I am addicted! Go during the middle of the week for less of a crowd, the place can not hold many people. Sit at the sushi bar, the sushi chefs are amazing!"}
{"text":"I've had Sushi all over the world.  My precious favorite was in the old train station in Osaka Japan, but this is my new fav.

Try Primo, Amazing Grace and Pretty in Pink."}
{"text":"Temari doesn't look like much when spotted from busy Val Vista Drive but don't judge a book by its cover. Inside this quirky strip mall Japanese eatery awaits some seriously tasty sushi. We ordered three massive rolls--Saki, Something Bad, and Tropical--and each one packed a ton of fresh flavors (we liked the Something Bad roll best). The service was efficient (fist bump for the dollop of strawberry ice cream served with our post-dinner fortune cookies) and the setting was quiet and comfortable. I will definitely recommend Temari to all of my friends, especially those living on the East Side."}
{"text":"Great sushi spot, I can tell it was popular as the tables were full when I came in. Small place but thats how sushi restaurants should be. I sat in front of the head chef and he asked us what we liked and made us special rolls, very good."}
{"text":"I never review anything but am impelled to do one for Temari. This is by far the best sushi I've had in a very long time. We sat at the sushi bar and were greeted immediately by Saki the chef/owner. He asked us some questions then proceeded to make sushi he thought we'd like. He gave us one roll at a time and each one was absolutely delicious and different in every way. I highly recommend this place to anyone who has an appreciation for sushi!"}
{"text":"Excellent family owned restaurant in Gilbert. The owner is an amazing Sous-chef. He will personalize different rolls and they always turn out delicious. We highly recommend this outstanding restaurant. We drive from Queen Creek to eat here!!!"}
{"text":"Bummed that I just found this place.  Ate here for the second time tonight and food was 5-star worthy.  As per the reviews, the Tuna Poke and Primo roll were amazing.  This will be my go-to sushi place now!"}
{"text":"The sushi was amazing, service was great, and the sushi chef was very friendly. I can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"Yelp find for the WIN! I'll start by saying they don't take reservations on Friday and Saturday nights. It's a fairly small restaurant so it's a first come, first serve for the busy nights. We walked in around 6:30pm on a Saturday and the place was filled. We put our name down on a piece of paper and waited about 15min. We were seated at the sushi bar and given two menus and a order sheet. 

We ordered 2 nigiri and the primo roll to start. We then ordered sake and agadashi tofu from the waitress. Yum, yum and yum! I was already getting really full but we wanted to try one more roll so we ordered the AZ roll. I'm glad we tried it because it was also really good. Both rolls had a great combination of sweet and spicy. 

Only advice I would give to any newbies is to look at the menu before going because they have 3 pages (yes, 3) of sushi rolls. 

We don't always get out without our girls so we'll bring them for lunch on our next visit because they also have a big selection of food for the non sushi eater."}
{"text":"Still waiting for my food ....... 45+ minutes for 3 rolls, really !! Never again..."}
{"text":"Temari is the most reasonably priced and still delicious Japanese restaurant I've ever been to. Their service is also wonderful! They always include complimentary ice cream at the end of your meal. Their bento boxes have really generous portions of whatever you order, and their salad with homemade dressing is amazing (which is really uncommon in the salad that comes with bento boxes). They offer specialty rolls with Arizona themes, and they're all really good. If you have a group larger than 6, make a reservation because space is tight."}
{"text":"Saki the sushi artist is the BEST!!  We have been coming here for at least 10 years and this place NEVER disappoints!  Service is amazing and it's always packed.  My FAVORITE sushi place in Arizona hands down!!!!!  LovE you guys!!!"}
{"text":"Just went there for my first time and got the mango roll, California roll, chicken teriyaki Japanese dinner, and the temari ball. Literally the worst sushi and service I have ever had. Let's start from the beginning

I went into the restaurant and asked the lady if she had any recommendations on any sushi rolls that had salmon in them and were spicy. She responded \"no, why don't you read the menu\". Completely disrespectful! Sushi is my favorite food and EVERY new place I go to I always ask that to see what the employees like, not some rude comment in response. Anyways I ordered off their weird menu and waited about 30 min just for my girlfriend to get her chicken teriyaki. It was EXTREMELY dry and overcooked! Then she waited about another 15 minutes for the California rolls that barely had any avocado in them. Those were the only decent part of my entire meal, but then again how could you mess up a California roll? After my girlfriend finished eating and waited about 15 more minutes my food finally arrived. By this time I was STARVING! The mango roll came and was extremely boring. Was only mango and tempura crunches inside with salmon on top. All I could taste was the mango and wasabi sauce they put on. After that was done about 10 minutes later my temari ball showed up and had some sort of cotton candy on top of it! Which was not in the description! Anyways I scraped it off and moved on. The avocado was really good but all the crab was EXTREMELY bland and dry inside of it! Never done this before but ended up not leaving a tip after how mad I was over the quality of the food and especially the service I received! DEFINITELY will not be going here again. Luckily I just moved to the area and this was the first sushi place I tried. If this place has 4 stars on Yelp I am not looking forward to the other places..."}
{"text":"My dad took me here for dinner because it's just around the corner from his condo. Very small little place, but I've found that even the smallest places have awesome food. He comes here often!

The service was great. The sushi chef was very friendly. The food was awesome. We split an array of rolls: Rainbow Roll, Dragon Roll, Spicy Tuna Roll, Salmon Nigri, Sashimi. Everything tasted fresh! If you're not a fan of seaweed, you can get the rolls wrapped in soy paper. Although I don't recommend this because they fall apart on route to your mouth!  

Overall good experience!"}
{"text":"Hands down the best sushi ever!!!! I have been there at least 5 times in the last 6 months. Things you should know about me. 1. I LOVE sushi. 2. I have eaten sushi at SEVERAL different places. 3. I do not throw around the phrase 'best ever' lightly! 4. I HATE spicy tuna, or tuna in general. 

My first time I went here, I was skeptical. Let's be honest, it is not the prettiest place and it is in a strip mall.  When I looked at the menu and saw the majority of the rolls had either spicy tuna or regular tuna - I was worried. ( Please reference #4 above) However, two of my favorite rolls are the green apple roll and the Primo roll... Both have tuna in them. I have taken two out of town guests here, ironically also NOT tuna fans. Both have adored this venue. 

The only roll I was not a fan of had a fried green pepper and a sweet sauce on top. My recommendations/endorsements would be - Grand Canyon roll, primo roll, val vista roll, killer roll, dynamite scallops (ask for them to be served over rice!) green apple roll, green apple roll, green apple roll  - did I mention the green apple roll????"}
{"text":"Small, intimate sushi bar and dining area that has some of the best sushi in the east valley. Highly recommend Temari even if you have to hang a bit and wait for an open table."}
{"text":"Our favorite sushi , in AZ.
Been coming here for 9 years, never had a bad meal. Wife's favorite, special shrimp roll, is out of this world. Nothing to compare. My personal fave is soft shell crab roll. Served with a bit of seasoned vinegar, perfect. 
Small place, cozy, just one server usually. 
Only complaint, because of size, gets smoky from fryer.  We'll live with that because the sushi is so good."}
{"text":"UPDATE 1/31/16 -  Ate their tonight.  Unimpressed!  The prices aren't that high.  But, the sushi items, rolls, etc. are none thrilling.  My next sushi experience will be elsewhere.

Just a note that the Menu items shown on Yelp is not complete.  They did not list any of their Entrees.  Plus, I'm sure their Shrimp Tempura is frozen...not fresh.  I will not go to a restaurant and pay high prices for FROZEN FOOD.  For what restaurants charge, cook me fresh food."}
{"text":"Very good sushi, one of the best in Gilbert. Very fresh, very busy. Sashimi is great here, recommend the cold saki. Wait is worth it!!!"}
{"text":"Love this place. Staff is friendly. Rolls are delicious!  Make sure to try the Primo roll!"}
{"text":"Had some time without the kids today and thought I'd have some sushi for lunch. Walked in and was hit with an intensely strong fried oil smell. I was seated quickly and offered a drink by a friendly waitress. Having browsed the pictures and menu on here, I pretty much knew what I wanted. I ordered the tonkatsu Ramen, gyoza, and a Las Vegas roll. Gyzo came out quick and was tasty. They are steamed and very lightly fried. My Ramen came out next and sadly, either my palate was too overwhelmed by the fried food smell, or it was extremely lacking in flavor. I set it off to the side to bring home for my kids. 

It took quite some time for the Las Vegas roll to come out, and I was very much looking forward to it. As with a LOT of sushi places, the rolls were cut so thick as to be almost impossible to eat in one bite. You either look like a pig shoving the whole thing in, or you make a mess deconstructing it to eat in bites. I opted to do the former and ignore any stares of disgust directed my way ;) I have to say that while I've had better, Temari makes a very good Vegas roll. The only issues are the size of the pieces and the amount of sauce. It was drowning in sauce, and by the last two or three pieces it completely fell apart. After I was done, I was given a cute little cup with a tiny scoop of ice cream and a fortune cookie. I thought that really added to the whole friendly vibe of the place. Nice touch.

I'd give 3 stars for food, however I am bumping it up a star for the very attentive waitress, the friendly sushi chef, and the cute decor. The duct work and piping above could use a cleaning, and a backdoor should be opened to air out the oil smell, but otherwise it was a fun atmosphere. Would I go out of my way to come back? Probably not. I would definitely drop in if I happened to already be in the area though."}
{"text":"We go out of our way to hit this AMAZING sushi bar.  Sake treats you right with the FRESHEST seafood in the East Valley! Once you get hooked, he draws you in even further with his sushi creativity that will knock your socks off!  

I'll go ahead and share my favorite, but you better promise not to eat it all before I get there! Seared Ahi with an onion sauce. There are no words, it's just that good! Admittedly, we are addicted, we've been seen there up to 3x a week.

While Temari might be small in space, it's how you know you're at the RIGHT PLACE! None of those chain-like sushi bars will do for my family, even my 9 year old knows they don't compare.  Another caution, is do NOT expect to be seated quickly on a Friday or Saturday. It is their busiest nights of the week as one would might imagine! People are trekking from far away cities because they KNOW GREAT SUSHI!"}
{"text":"I've been coming here for years and love every moment as much as the first. Be adventurous and have faith. Everything is amazing and delicious, always. The staff is more than accommodating, kind, courteous and welcoming. Every chance I get even without a craving For sushi I visit Temari."}
{"text":"First time here. Amazing!! Primo and Surprise Roll. So good. We came based on Yelp reviews. Did not disappoint."}
{"text":"I have absolutely loved this place since I came for the first time years ago. The Primo Roll, Las Vegas Roll, Gilbert Roll, and Caterpillar Roll are amongst my favorites. I normally buy to go because it's a very small place and mostly packed. The times I have eaten here at the Restaurant my only complaint is that the food does not come out st the same time as everyone else in the table (maybe just my bad luck) I am here reviewing them and everyone in my family is done eating and I have not gotten my food yet. That is the only reason I knocked down a star since the service is slow every single time I have been here. Other than that TOTALLY recommended"}
{"text":"Hands down the best sushi in the valley! Love the intimate atmosphere as well. Highly recommended!!!!!"}
{"text":"Temari is amazing. Always very fresh and the Owner is inviting and friendly. There is a new male waiter that needs to learn his manners though. Happy to say the food makes up for his actions. :)"}
{"text":"My husband and children love Temari. Danny & Saki (Sushi chefs) really make you feel welcome. It's family owned and full of regulars. The portions are very generous and the prices are great! We have been going for 4 years and tried other places and always end up coming back here. Great neighborhood sushi bar. Minimal seating, can call ahead to check availability. No reservations can be made. Try the Tuna Poke #7, Playboy roll, Spicy Salmon Skin Hand roll. Yum."}
{"text":"My dad introduced me to this place.  Danny is awesome. Sake is awesome. They have like a book of rolls to choose from. Their poke is amazing. Spicy fresh and filling.  I get it every single time.  It's a small place so can fill up but the sushi is more than worth it."}
{"text":"Best sushi in town! It's small and crowded but it is genuinely great food...get the tuna poke!! YUM!! They definitely know what they're doing here!"}
