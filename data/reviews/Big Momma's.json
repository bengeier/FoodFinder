{"text":"Good food and a very good price, I would give it 5 stars but the atmosphere in the restaurant was awful, waiting for our food you could hear the low hum of the bulbs between the sounds of the tv buffering. They should really do something about the fact that my wife and I walked over there and couldn't tell the place was even open standing in front of the store because it was so dark form the outside. But the food was very good, I just couldn't get over the fact that it seemed like I was in a movie where the place was just about to get robbed ."}
{"text":"Thought i'd give thus place a try being in my home town. I was very disappointed. I got the jerk chicken with rice and peas and it had no flavour except spice. Don't get me wrong I love spice but this was flavourless. What a shame!"}
{"text":"Excellent service, fast & friendly. Too bad the food was not up to par. Jerk pork was extremely mild, the rice and peas was dry and flavourless, the roti shell was dried out and crunchy, the boneless chicken curry was extremely salty, the patties were mild and bland (but you can give partial blame to the supplier as they outsource these).
Maybe we were in on an off day, maybe they are trying to cater to the local palate, either way I don't see us going back."}
{"text":"Happy to find some carribean food on my way home from work, North of the city.

Visited on a Saturday night about 7:30pm and there was one couple who had dined in, just finishing up. We spoke to Chris, as he was running the place solo this evening. He was very pleasant and social.

We ordered chicken curry, goat curry, oxtail, and jerk pork all as dinners with rice and peas as well some coleslaw. We also ordered 4 plain roti shells/skins.

- not enough meat
- decent flavours
- shells are frozen, come in packs of 5. They are delicious though

Cost was about $45 with tax.

Will visit again to try the jerk chicken and curry chicken roti.

Place needs to be cleaned up a bit."}
{"text":"Friendly staff, welcoming environment, fair prices. Fast service. I have no complaints. Everything was great, I just didn't like the food."}
{"text":"Very friendly staff :) I love being greeted by a smile and a genuine personality. 
Delicious, REAL food. Everyone should try it at least once. Yum."}
{"text":"I recently tried Big Mommas and really enjoyed myself. The food was delicious, I got jerk pork with slaw and rice and peas. Very good food, after just coming back from a vacation to Jamaica I was having a craving for rice and peas and this conquered it for me! The only reason I am giving this a 4 star instead of 5 is because they only take cash, and I was unaware of that when I got there! However, I will definitely return!"}
{"text":"A hidden gem 

My daughter and I stumbled upon this place one afternoon. 

It's tucked away in the parking lot behind the Mexican restaurant.   Entering it felt like we were away on vacation... the music, smell of the spices, the owner's stories....

The food is fresh, generous portions, tons of flavor, not over salted and AFFORDABLE.  

The curried goat was to die for!"}
{"text":"Grood authentic Caribbean dishes. The portions were ok but could be improved.
The staff is very friendly.
The place needs some cleaning up and  improvement."}
