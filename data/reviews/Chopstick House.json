{"text":"tried many different hakka places but this one for sure stands out for me. dine in or even taken equally good. crispy dragon chicken and chowmein are amongst my top favourites."}
{"text":"The Spicy Dragon Chicken is PHENOMENAL!  Honestly,  I didn't really like anything other than dragon chicken but that dragon chicken was so good that I'd go back just for that.   The interior was nice but there were a lot of kids so it was pretty loud. The service was good however I felt that the waiters were nicer to some people and not all.   Recommendation: Spicy Dragon Chicken!"}
{"text":"Chicken was super dry and it was processed chicken. There are many other chinese hakka food that are better."}
{"text":"This place is awesome. The Indonesian fried rice is my favorite. The dragon chicken is also tasty. I'm still looking for another good chicken dish to try.  The pakora platter is also a must try."}
{"text":"Not the best I've ever had, but pretty damn good for the price   Quick delivery too"}
{"text":"I've tried two other hakka Chinese places, but chopstick house is by far the best. Their sweet & sour chicken and chilli chicken is something to try out!!!"}
{"text":"Dirty tables, sticky chairs, spotted silverware, unprofessional waiters, needs more workers. But good food!   Patronised by the local Pakistani population."}
{"text":"I think I had the worst Hakka Food ever. So bad that we took 2 bites, paid and left the restaurant. We ordered Ginger Chicken and Manchurian Fish. Both of the sauces tasted the same. Fish was so bad I don't want to think an image in my head. Chicken meat quality was worst than I have ever eaten. Do your self a favor and go to Hakka Legend which is at Markham and Lawrence I think.  Less than 5 min drive."}
{"text":"Pretty tasty and fresh. Reasonable pricing and super fast take out service! General Tsos chicken and beef fried rice were good! Crab wontons are a little sweet."}
{"text":"I think it's natural for a new restaurant to have some kinks initially. I've been here about 3 times since they opened and the food has been very consistent. The crispy dragon chicken is a must try!  We also tried the crispy chilli chicken and that is another amazing dish. The taste was very distinct and different from other Hakka restaurants where the chicken is drowning in a pool of gravy and onions. The Pakistani twist on the Hakka food is something I really enjoy after trying pretty much every other halal Hakka restaurant in Toronto.   Service is also great - there is one waiter who always gives us good recommendations and I think he recognizes us by now! The restaurant is clean and food always arrives in a timely fashion. Chopstick House will continue to be our go-to for halal Hakka Chinese."}
{"text":"I'm not even sure why this place isn't out of business yet. The food doesn't taste that great and on top it, they are ridiculously stingy. I ordered a large tom yum soup with shrimp amd guess what they did? They chopped up one piece of mashroom and one small shrimp...and I repeat, one small shrimp for the entire large soup! I had chili chicken from this place, it was runny, watery processed chicken full off skin and fat. Never again."}
{"text":"I should've probably walked out when I entered this place and noticed that there were no other customers in the place and it took 5 minutes for someone to greet us. It was 28Â°C today, and the air conditioning was not on. There was no background music or anything, we ate our sub-par chilli chicken in complete silence. Will not be going back anytime soon. Service was horrible."}
{"text":"The food here is decent but the service SUCKS! It's exceptionally slow. This is my second time here and during dinner, someone drove up to the door, honks the horn and brings them something in a plastic bag. This is the second time this happened so odd, mysterious and super slooooow. Btw the paneer pakora is good."}
{"text":"I ordered their food today for the first time.  Stir fried veg had almost no veg in it.  I counted 2-3 small pieces of broccoli, same for cauliflower and carrots.  It was almost entirely gravy.  The broccoli was also slightly sour which makes me think the food was going off. Ginger chicken is battered, they told me it wasn't, it was like soggy fried chicken in a somewhat tasteless, thick gravy. The Steamed rice was like one blob of rice all stuck together.    Pros Crispy beef tasted pretty good and Worker was friendly and helpful and the food was prepared quickly.  I was really disappointed in this Hakka food."}
{"text":"First walked in dead zone no one inside, was not actual greeted then seated with two menus,  my kids and my husband thats 4  Not 2, Anways she proceeded to bring tap warm water,  holding a dirty tray, with a jug she placed the jug with middle finger inside the jug on the table, so i immediately asked for another. We ordered fish pakora, arrives 10 mins in soaked in oil, we also ordered beef chowmein and chilly chicken, that arrived 25 mins in no arrival update no music not greeting food tasted literally 1star of effort. Never returning"}
{"text":"We got sick from the food here.   Service takes forever. Do not recommend."}
{"text":"Wasn't a good experience.  Went to celebrate a birthday for a mutual friend, the food was okay but the hospitality was not that great.  When asked for an extra plate, the server proactively said, they don't have anymore plate as it was late and all the plates are in the sink giving the excuse of the dishwasher not showing up for work. I hope that was the last time I visited."}
{"text":"I have been to this place few times as it is near my home. Their dragoon chicken is amazing."}
{"text":"I order from here all the time, best Chinese food on the east side of Pittsburgh, very friendly and quick delivery."}
{"text":"I've been to Chopstick House many times and have never had a bad experience. I find their food quite delicious and very filling. However, the last time I went I was \"welcomed\" with some very rude customer service. We weren't sure what time the restaurant was closing but we had gone in a bit too close to closing time. As soon as we walked in, one of the waitress' started being extremely rude telling us that the restaurant is closing so we can't come in! I asked if we could do take out but she said the take-out time had already passed. Look, I understand if your policy is to finish taking your orders 30 minutes prior to closing and take-out 15 minutes prior to closing, but there is a way to talk to your customers. The waitress then proceeded to ask her manager if she can let us in. She came back a few minutes later telling us that we can stay as long as we finish eating in ten minutes! Who goes to a restaurant to sit and eat for ten minutes?! The whole purpose of going out to eat at a restaurant is to sit, relax and enjoy time with family and friends. The waitress was extremely cranky and clearly wanted to go home. Regardless, that's no excuse to be rude to your customers. You are working in customer service, it is part your job to be polite and welcoming. Even if she wasn't allowed to let us in, she could have easily said it politely along the lines of \"I apologize but we are just about to close. But we open up tomorrow at so and so time so you are more then welcome to come back tomorrow.\" Needless to say, we did not stay and eat for ten minutes (which was already a ridiculous suggestion in the first place). We ended up going to another restaurant where the food was delicious and the waiters were very polite."}
{"text":"Wow I walked in here really hoping to love this place but within the first five minutes I was appalled. So we entered the restaurant and got seated and the waitress arrived with our menus a while later. When I ordered soup I asked if she would be able to divide it into two bowls (which if you're a connoisseur of Chinese restaurants, you'd know this is a benign request). She proceeds to brusquely tell me that that isn't possible but that she can give me an extra bowl-- which is exactly what I requested, one soup in two bowls. I was really turned off by their service which is subpar at best. Won't be returning here because I really don't appreciate rude customer service personnel. I've worked in customer service and I've had to deal with various kinds of people, so I don't really understand why my request warranted a rude response."}
{"text":"What an unexpectedly lovely place!  Hakka Chinese food is one of my favourites, though I always need a yogurt/lassi drink close by before the tears start! Hot!  I had the chilli chicken lunch special ($6.99!), which came with delicious corn soup, steamed rice, and a spring roll. I chose the hot garlic option for my chicken - and it was spicy goodness heaven. The menu is quite extensive - rolls and pakora, soups, fish, chicken, beef, veggies, chow mein & noodles. I also tried the Crispy Dragon Chicken with cashews. Excellent!    Prices generally under $10. Decent service, quiet ambiance. Decor here is beautiful, modern, and dare I say - trendy. Not super busy - so spread the word...  (P.S. It is 100% Halal)"}
{"text":"The food was awful, I love Hakka food but the ginger chicken was crap the American chopsuy there special was especailly crap. They should be closed down for imitating Hakka food. The chow mein was decent except I asked for chow mein with chicken and shrimp instead I got chow mein with hardly any chicken and no shrimp. Let me say there are way better Hakka places in the area"}
{"text":"Delicious Hakka food; highly recommend the hot 'n' sour soup, crispy chili beef and Indonesian fried rice! The service is good. I've been going here for the past 3 years and the quality of the food has been consistent. Prices are great for the amount of food you get and I've found it to be a clean place."}
{"text":"Quality and taste of food... I would give it 4 star.  Price and quantity of food.... this place deserves 5 star. Overall... 3 star, mainly because of the very slow service, only 1 or 2 person taking care of everything!!      I love American Chopsuey, and their quantity is huge!!! ...and the taste is much better than most of the Hakka Chinese. We went there quite few times, probably will go there again."}
{"text":"Manchurian beef chowmein $8.49 - large portions, small amount of beef, not overly spicy. A good filling meal at a decent price. Inside is small but decent amount of seating. The take-out process was nice and quick as there were no lineups."}
{"text":"Waited 20 minutes for a table, once we received the table we were told they are not accepting anymore orders but since we waited 20 minutes for a table they said they would serve us but it would be after at least an hour so we ended up leaving. Understaffed and very bad customer service."}
{"text":"Ordered delivery to our room at the Comfort Inn. Delivery was within 30 minutes and the food was great! Highly recommend.."}
{"text":"I ordered an American style noodle because it looked amazing in the picture on their takeout menu. Was expecting a plate of crispy noodles with some saucy chicken on top but got a plate of noodles drowning with too much sauce. Noodles weren't crispy anymore and the dish has a bit of a kick to it. Was able to find 2-3 shrimp that were so dried up it's like it was leftovers from a few nights. I give them one star for the plating and portion of the food, however most of the stars were lost due to the very poor customer service. The waiter/cashier did not like to entertain question even to new guests, never bothered to check the table after he slammed a jug of water and has an attitude problem. It's unfortunate because there are some items that look very appetizing on the menu. But overall this experience was unpleasant ."}
