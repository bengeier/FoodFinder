{"text":"Great tapas menu, delicious selection of wines, attentive service. This gem was the perfect ending to a long day at the office. Recommendations: Oxtail Empanadas, Stuffed Piquillo Peppers and the Albondigas (meatballs) all paired nicely with the Spanish red wine (pictured). The ambiance was enticing with music in the background, but low enough to have a conversation without escalating your voice. The area has some great shops within walking distance."}
{"text":"I recently stumbled upon this restaurant with 2 friends, while out on a Sat. stroll. I love the tapas concept in restaurants, so it grabbed my attention for that reason, and the cozy, warm interior coupled with a small but inviting covered patio added to the appeal.  The food was excellent .. we had the lamb plate special, tasty paella, and the great house fries. Prices were totally in line with the quality of the food and service, the only disappointment for me was the rather uninspired dessert menu. But overall, a great find, and we'll be back."}
{"text":"Overall decent meal and wine but there were some hiccups on the way.  Our table wasn't fully cleared when we were sat.  Took a few minutes before the server came by the rectify things.   Food wise, the croquettes and stuffed peppers were awesome but the ceviche was pretty flavorless, meatballs kind of tasted store bought  Might give it another shot"}
{"text":"If you like tapas, you'll love Corks. This is a great little restaurant. The food is exceptional and the staff is very friendly.  The patio is cozy and quaint.  The piquillo peppers stuffed with lamb, olives and chili were outstanding, as were the calamari fritti and shrimp fritters  The Patatas Fritas (hand cut fries) tossed with smoked paprika and served with aioli and tomato sofrito were very good.  Keeping with the Spanish theme, they had a nice lager from Barcelona called Moritz.  Will definitely make Corks a frequent dining spot!"}
{"text":"Good selection of tapas. The paella is a decent representation of the original Spanish version. Nice patio to talk and have a glass of wine. Inside is cozy and inviting as well. Good service."}
{"text":"Not bad at all! Small place with 2 chefs roasting, frying and grilling up some quality tapas. Price is very reasonable"}
{"text":"Excellent food, the service the best, highly recommended, the place very comfortable, good for a dining with friends and family."}
{"text":"we went there for the first time last night, after hearing good recommendations both on Yelp! and from friends.  We opted to go for a selection of Tapas rather than entrees.    We had the following:  Tempura Fish Tacos:  A Wild Boar Sliders: B+ Albondigas (lamb meatballs): A+ (this was our favourite) Frites: B+ Jamon, Chorizo, Manchego: A  Whitehaven Sauvignon Blanc: A+  Friendly service, and served in great decor within downtown oakville.  Would definitely come back, especially when they open up the patio!  Thanks Corks!"}
{"text":"Lovely restaurant to grab dinner after an afternoon of strolling along Lakeshore. Friendly service and quiet atmosphere. Would recommend for a quiet dinner. The paella was good but could use some seasoning."}
{"text":"Great patio and atmosphere, with wonderful and quick service. I am only giving it 3 stars because the food was not the greatest. We had the guacamole and salsa as an appetizer which was likely the highlight of our meal but still not amazing - the guacamole tasted like olive oil to me which was odd, and the homemade chips were a bit greasy. Then we ordered 2 tacos each thinking they were a decent size but they were literally 2 bites which was disappointing. They didn't offer the pork tacos so we got the chorizo and the fish taco, both of which lacked flavour. Since we were still hungry after the minuscule tacos we ordered the fries which were just ok. Overall a good spot to sit on the patio and have a beer, but the food could really use some more flavour."}
{"text":"Best restaurant in Oakville. The BEST restaurant in Oakville!  Great flavors, beautiful dining room, those long pieces of cutlery let you quickly take food off someone else's plate without them even knowing, and the food is sensational. Really unique tastes and the Tasting Menu totally hit the spot. Love it. Will be back for sure..."}
{"text":"We were in Oakville & wanted somewhere to grab a quick app & a drink. Checked yelp & ended up here. Not disappointing:)  The place is quaint, our server (Kelly?) was awesome & gave great recommendations too!!   Our food got out to us quickly (wasnt a busy time btw). The pork tacos are DIVINE!!!!! Order them, if nothing else. They will also soon be offering fish tacos.   The ambience of the place was nice - altho for such a small space, ppl should really speak quieter as it didnt strike me as the type of place that wanted to give off a roudy/bar feel.... It seems a bit more upscale/trendy than that but cant blame the restaurant for  patrons without proper dining etiquette.   The kitchen area can be seen from outside walking by on the sidewalk  which is kind of neat:)  Parking is available on the street or about 2 blocks down at a pay lot (Free on Sunday evenings) and also a parking garage right behind"}
{"text":"3.5 stars   Sometimes this urbanite will get out of the city to see good friends. Burlington can be too far so Oakville is a good compromise. After only getting bar seating at Maluca (not their fault; ours), we wanted to have a table. So Corks--same owners as Maluca--was a good Plan B.   VIBE  Set on this strip is a bunch of quaint, little restaurants. Corks is no exception. You wouldn't see this type of decor/resto in Toronto as much. It's got a traditional set up of white table cloths and deuces or four-tops but it feels cozy and casual at the same time. There's a bunch of Japanese art on the back walls. It's nice. There were a lot of couples and later on a bigger party. This attracts the 30-up crowd. It was nice to just sit, talk and catch up with friends. This is definitely a date-night place in Oakville.   Service was good and our server was friendly but a bit pushy. No need to come over to our table every five minutes and check up on us. Kind of annoying. If we need something, we'll let you know.   WE ATE  I love that Corks is all about tapas and sharing. So that's what we did!  We got a complimentary order of french fries with paprika, which were quite addictive.  The bread here is also addictive. Soft and chewy.  We started with the beet salad. Am I the only one that didn't know beets can also be yellow/orange in colour? It was served with olive oil and fior di latte cheese. It was fantastic (and at the time, I just had a dental procedure so a good \"soft\" option for my teeth).  We had the charcuterie - get the meat one over the cheese. The meat tray was served with this hard bread. It looked like it could break your teeth in half! But the selection of meats - from prosciutto to salumi- were good. It's no Black Hoof but a nice sampler. I feel like I could have created the cheese sampler at home. There were three big blocks of cheese. I'd like to see more artisinal cheese in lesser portions. More selection, less portion would make me order the cheese plate again.  The chorizo plate and its sauce was fantastic  The paella was okay. Maybe I'm realizing I'm not a big fan of the fruits de mer in my rice. There were two big shrimp and a few mussels in the dish. Meh! We didn't finish it.  So in summary, get:  beets, meat charcuterie, fries, and chorizo  For three people, the bill came out to $100 and change. So for around $35 we got a lot of food.   OBLIGATORY CATCHY REMARK  Forgive me for referring to myself in the third person. Is that douchey? A nice place for a long sit-down on a rainy day."}
{"text":"Patio is fun, came here during the Jazz festival so we could enjoy some live music w our dinner. Service is decent, not exceptional. Not sure if this is he general trend but the restaurant was all 65+. Lots of fried tapas, they didn't have the pork tacos which others have recommended on the menu. Lamb meatballs are pretty good, nothing blew us away but fairly good for a suburban find."}
{"text":"The meal was pretty decent overall but there were a few dishes that I didn't like.  Fries - good, and I really liked the aioli.  Mushrooms - very creamy and full of mushroom flavor.  Piquillos - I didn't really like the texture of the peppers or the cheese. The others that I dined with liked it but I was not a fan.  Paella - I wouldn't say that their paella is super authentic since it didn't come out in a paella pan and there wasn't a crispy paella crust - with that being said, it was quite delicious. The rice was well-cooked (although not exactly how a paella probably should taste) and it was not at all skimpy on the meat or seafood. Tastewise, I'd still recommend this."}
