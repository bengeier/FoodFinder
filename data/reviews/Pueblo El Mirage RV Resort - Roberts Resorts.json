{"text":"Very disappointed in the integrity of a reservation. We made a reservation for a pull through two weeks in advance. We even called 4 hours before arrival to assure a pull through due to the size of our rig. However when we arrived at 6pm we were told our pull through had been given to someone else and we were put in a back in that was too short. The reservation manager was not apologetic and told us that a reservation for a pull through only assured us a \"spot\". She said we were welcome to find someplace else if we weren't happy. Too bad because this is a nice resort with Pickleball courts but if we can't depend on the integrity of a reservation, we won't be back. We have referred people to this resort but never again."}
{"text":"Nov 2016. This is our fourth visit to El Mirage! I have a sister that lives here so when we come to visit each year we always stay at El Mirage.  a very nice facility with plenty of things to do and nice RV spots we have a 40 foot Class A motorhome. It is close to a jet fighter facility. \" it's the sound of freedom!\""}
{"text":"The golf course is overpriced for the condition of the course.  I will not play this course again.  The greens are terrible and fairways are weedy."}
{"text":"This was a really great stay! The people were super nice, and the campgrounds as well. Everything was clean and well maintained. We got to the resort past closing and thought we might not be let in, but they were super nice and happily let us in. I would definitely recommend this place if you have an RV."}
{"text":"The playability and condition of the course is fair for the price you pay, however the way the course is managed is without a doubt in the 40 years of playing the game the worse I have seen. Had a tee time of 1:55 for 2 players, checked in at 1:40 and the gentleman told us to go ahead and head to tee #1 and start.  Very nice and friendly.   got to the tee and there was already a wait, a group in the fairway and on the green. after a 10min wait we got started, but after each shot had to wait until the group in front of us moved on, this was the normal routine for the entire round. at the third hole the group behind us caught us at the tee box and asked what are tee time was, told them 1:55, they were mildly upset due to they had a time ahead of ours, we explained to them that the gentleman in the pro shop told us to get started.  They were fine with it just curious.  After short conversation we discovered that the course sets tee times 7min apart, this is insane and would explain the massive wait at each hole.  And this was a weekday afternoon, not even a weekend.  Tee times should be 10-11min. As we moved along with our round trying to make the best of it, we were approaching the 18th green, time was 5:50, which considering the consistent waiting throughout the day was pretty good time to about have the round completed. A gentleman who appeared to be a grounds keeper came to us in a cart as we were walking to the green and informed us that there is a $25 fee for turning golf carts in after 5:30. We explained to him when we started and the constant wait and he said that is the rules and  that the club house closes around 2-3. First issue is We paid for 18 holes of golf, it stays light until 6:30-6:45. Why would you even attempt to collect a ridiculous charge like this. There are too many quality golf courses in the Phoenix area to ever mess with this place again."}
{"text":"We went to the Pueblo El Mirage Country Club for dinner the other night with a group of 11.  Our friend was celebrating a birthday and wanted to enjoy the fish fry.   The facility is nice and I can see it being transformed into a very elegant location for a wedding. There are loads of tables and booths in the club.   The food was good enough. Nothing special. The Fish Fry is an all-you-can-eat fry and they do offer baked fish as well along with a choice of regular or sweet potato french fries. You also get a cup of coleslaw. The fish was largely portioned and the sweet potato fries were yummy. The coleslaw was very bland though.   Service is very slow here at the club though and that's what is keeping me from being terribly excited about it. We waited almost 30 minutes from the time of ordering for us to receive our appetizers and that's really not acceptable. The place was busy but I got the feeling that the wait staff just isn't trained well on time management skills. Our server did try his best and tried to get with the program but just couldn't seem to get his ducks in a row.   I will go back as the food was good and my husband and son are eager to give the golf course a whirl. Hopefully the service will improve soon!"}
{"text":"After being here a few weeks, I have a few bitches!  The main problem is the air force base being very very close. It is Luke Air Force Base. The fighter jets are taking off over the resort constantly. They start at 7:00 AM and continue until well after 9:00 PM. And I mean this is every day!  It is so loud when you are outside that you cannot hear anything else or let alone talk to someone. My other bitch is the garbage service, there is only 2 days a week for garbage pickup and that's it.  There is no dumpster or cans to take your garbage to anywhere in the park, and they let you know that. Plus you cannot have any bags outside period. So you must take it in your car and find a dumpster somewhere else or leave it in the trunk for days until the next pickup. Other than that the park is nice!"}
{"text":"This is our 1st visit to Pueblo El Mirage, we came here because friends had stopped here a few weeks prior to us. We had been staying in Resorts in the Mesa, AZ area & got tired of just seeing Park Models & concrete. We are pleasantly surprised at the beautiful green grounds & over all appearance of the Resort.  The sites are spacious, clean & our premium site has a nice table & outside area to enjoy.  The jets that others have mentioned have not been an issue for us, we live near an airport & just accept the air noise I guess. The Wi-Fi (for $5.00 a day) is very efficient. All the staff that has crossed our paths are very friendly & personable.  We will return when in the area.    The Passport America rate that went into effect Apr. 1 is a Bonus!"}
{"text":"Course and the people who run it are a joke. Never been so digusted with service. The lady who runs it is beyond rude. Got kicked out the course cause they wanted to go home. My round was only 3.5 hours..serves them right being next to a trailer park"}
{"text":"This place is very nice, but it doesn't make up for the rude people running the place. The receptionists when we checked in on 3-25-18 were just rude and annoyed with a few questions we asked. Such as the rate we were paying! Also my husband started talking to the concierges and they were annoyed he didn't come right over to them.The concierges we awesome though. A woman at the front gate was rude 2 days in a row as we waited for UBER to come. Same thing, didn't want to answer any questions. Please understand we have never been here before and of course we are going to have questions. Everyone needs some customer service training at this place, everyone including them would be happier!"}
{"text":"Very overpriced and under managed. The place stinks from skunks because there is garbage left out as the \"management\" can't seem to be able to negotiate a waste management contract and there are only pickups twice a week, with a two bag limit. Last night we went to a show here and they had 480 seniors packed in the ballroom with no air conditioning on a 88 F degree day. This place is run like a mom and pop shop but they charge big prices for everything.   The noise from the air force jets is really loud as they're so low when the pass over, sometimes all day long.   Sites are dirt/gravel with full hookups WAY in the back of the site. You may require extra hoses for water and sewer. Some sites have a concrete patio and some also have a concrete pad for your vehicle, but there seems to be no  standard. Premium sites also have an 6 x 6 piece of fake grass in front and a concrete patio table, and what the front desk people warn is really slow wifi.  Common areas are nice, bathroom showers need updating, and I would make top down changes in the management.   RV'ers are an afterthought and their only focus is on selling vastly overpriced mobile homes. I really can't recommend this park for anything more than an overnight stay."}
{"text":"Nice golf course definitely worth the money and drive. The course is in great shape. Staff very very friendly. Haven't played this course in 20 years was pleasantly surprised."}
{"text":"Participated in a pickleball tournament here. The staff and people in general were kind, helpful and friendly. The pickleball courts are only a year or so old and are very nice. They have 16 outdoor courts in all. The only drawback here is that the facility is in the direct path of Luke Air Force base military jet flights and the noise is frequent and loud. Other than that, it's a winner."}
{"text":"I really enjoy this course ! I have played here 3 times in 2 weeks ! Great layout!   All of the staff is GREAT! Thank you !   I will be back again !"}
