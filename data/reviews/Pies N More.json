{"text":"I wanted to like this place. Sad to say, I did not. My dining companion has ordered before I arrived and had the chicken pot pie, but hers looked quite pale. I ordered mine, specifically asking that they brown it more. It arrived at the table still very light colored.  There was plenty of white meat chicken, but the veg in the pie was nothing more than I could have gotten out of a bag of frozen mixed.  Very little sauce and quite dry. The peach pie had a very underdone crust and one could see the raw dough on the top crust. I won't be back, unfortunately"}
{"text":"We stopped in to have lunch and pie, what a wonderful surprise!  Great soup and sandwich and the chicken pot pie was perfect.  The chocolate cream pie was awesome, as well as the peach-mango.  Friendly service and cute atmosphere too, it is our new favorite place!"}
{"text":"This place is\"ok\" but there's not enough on their menu to go back. If we do, we'll call to make sure their chicken pot pies are ready since they didn't have any baked when we stopped by. My husband had to\"settle\" and wasn't excited about the choices. Very reasonable though!!!"}
{"text":"I love this place. The food is fresh and top rate. Coconut cream pie is my favorite and they make the best I have ever eaten. Service is friendly and accommodating. Am getting hungry writing this and think I will go back tomorrow since they will now be open on Mondays!"}
{"text":"This place is horrible!  First let's start with the pie. Read everything negative in other reviews about the chocolate pie and it is hands down true! The filling tastes like it was instant pudding out of a box and the frosting tastes like cheap lard with some sugar in it; this is based on more than one person in my house tasting it. Now to the customer service.  I called on a Saturday and asked how much it would be for individual 4\" pies, I was quoted $2.00 - fair enough although, this is before tasting anything.  Went the following Saturday and let them know I was here to place an order of 60 pies for a party but, we had never been there and would like to sample what they considered their \"best\".  They pull out already cut lemon and chocolate and proceed to tell us that berry berry and apple were their other \"popular\" pies but they didn't have any cut. Strike One.  We proceed with the other two and I test the guy ( Darrin - we'll get to him later) and go to pay for the pies.  Now if I had gone anyplace else for a testing, with the possibility of a semi large order and IF the pies were good, with the possibility of my name getting out there, I would have said, \"Hey, the pies are on us\" but no, I proceed to pay the $6+ dollars for two slices of fairly mediocre pie and order for the party. I pay half the order but am oddly encouraged to pay the whole thing - screaming greed or I need your money to buy, the ingredients. Strike Two.  Then I get home and realize I have been charged $5.00 a pie.  It is $13-$14 for a whole pie that serves 6-8 and I was quoted $2.00. These pies in NO WAY are worth $5.00. At this point I am completely turned off by this place but I went back in with some hope of redemption from my first encounter. I return Monday. I have my second encounter with Darrin and let him know I was quoted $2.00 and charged $5.00.  He tells me there must have been a mistake.  HOW CAN THERE BE A MISTAKE? Nothing on your menu is $5.00 - you were trying to be greedy - in a seedy stripper way - trying to get a bill paid.  I then say, fine cancel the whole order and refund my money.  Darrin says okay, like he doesn't give a damn if he has customers or not. Not a \"can I correct that and save the business\", no apology, NOTHING but a crappy non caring attitude (guess that bill won't get paid).  I walk outside with my husband and say can you believe it!?! He says, \"It's probably not his business or money\". WRONG DARRIN IS THE OWNER  per the AZ Corp. Commission - I AM SHOCKED!!! Strike Three. Darrin, if you read this you need to know a few things: 1) You have a creepy, no warming, aura around you that reeks of distrust and greed. 2) Your pies are horrible and I do mean HORRIBLE! 3) Your customer service is appalling, at best. 4) Your store is dirty and since it was slow the first two and last times I was in there, maybe you could get off your creepy butt and clean. 5) I would bet big money you won't be in business long. 6) Do not believe ANYBODY that tells you your pies taste good unless they have lost ALL sense of taste- you shouldn't even be in business let alone THIS business. Bottom-line - Anybody looking for pie would be better off going to the frozen pie section of the grocery store."}
{"text":"Excellent quality in pies and food. Made fresh and the owners have a real passion for quality, service and creating an experience that will keep customers coming back and telling there friends. Wishing you guys the best of luck as you deserve it..."}
{"text":"I used to like this place but they seem to open and close whenever they want to. The hours on here is wrong, they open Monday through Saturday 7-6 if I remember correctly. The website says that the new hours of operation starts on August 29th but today is September 28th. I drove there, showed up around 7:20am or so, and the place is empty and locked."}
{"text":"First time visiting here, will not be my last.   Had a slice of Peach Mango pie,  crust is amazing (reminds me of Marie Callendars crust).   Also had a old favorite, Chicken Pot pie,  delicious!   Service was friendly, family run business that makes you feel at home.    Highly recommended this place for a To Go pie or sit in lunch."}
{"text":"Hot fudge pie was beyond wonderful !!!!   Took it to a pot luck and was a big hit.!!!"}
{"text":"So so place that is not likely to stay in business long. No one there during lunch on a Saturday."}
{"text":"I've been dying for a strawberry and rhubarb pie which seems like forever! I came across Pies N More just the other night, I walked in ( it was after closing time) and I ordered one pie. I knew I loved this place when I walked in after hours to be exact it was 15 mins after closing time and the employees were still happy to take my order and mentioned that they were closed on Mondays but would be happy to have it ready for Tuesday.  I went and picked up the pie today and it was exactly what I was looking for!!! The pie was FANTASTIC!!! I absolutely loved it! It brings me back to my childhood days of my mom making this same pie. I will definitely be back! The owner was very pleasant to deal with along with his employees who took my order the other night. I would highly recommend Pies N More to anyone looking for a great pie! Thank you Pies N More you've gain a regular customer and for a quick desert you took me immediately back to my childhood days when my mom would bake for us! You guys ROCK!!!!!"}
{"text":"I love pie, and I'm pretty darn picky when it comes to pies. I want to see a good crust first and foremost, and if I can find that I'm hooked. Well, consider me hooked!  To be honest, I wasn't expecting much from Pies N More. The place is in a rather unsightly strip mall, with a liquor store, a Goodwill and a dollar store. It's right next to a Pizza Hut carry out. I almost drove by instead of going in.  I'm so glad I did. I ordered two chicken pot pies, a cherry pie and an apple pie. They were all still warm from the oven and smelled amazing. The small chicken pot pie made a good meal for one person, and is comfort food at its finest. The cherry pie was my favorite, though the apple pie was good too.  I love the couple that run the business. It's a mom-and-pop shop, which I always want to support, and they seem really sweet and enthusiastic about the business.  There is no decent pie shop for miles around, so I really hope this place makes it."}
{"text":"Pretty frustrating their own website as well as Yelp say they're open right now, and they're not.  I traveled a fair bit to get here only to find a handwritten sign on the door saying \"closed until fall.\"   No bueno."}
{"text":"Eh...  I really wanted to like this place. We ordered carry out after we got a flyer in the mail. I got the quiche and salad combo. The quiche was cold. For some reason we all quiche was served warm, but it I guess not. It's not very good cold. My husbands ham and cheese sandwhich was 'okay.' He said that there was nothing special about it. The ranch dressing they use is awful. We ordered 2 chocolate cream pies and got one. Frankly, it tasted like chocolate pudding in a pie shell...nothing exciting. On the positive side, my pecan pie was yummy! Next time I will dine in the store to see if it's any better and give a second chance."}
{"text":"Pie was really good! Tried several kinds - banana cream, cherry, peach, and berry. The service was quick and friendly. Food (sandwiches and soup) was pretty good, not great. Will order holiday pies from here from now on!"}
{"text":"I ordered two spinach and cheese pies to go for a school event, and they were a great hit! Fresh made and delicious...thanks!"}
{"text":"Family run business with service with friendly that makes you feel at home    First time here after the Nielsen's Frozen Custard closed. S/W corner on Baseline and Power right next to a Pizza Hut carry out.  Lots of pies to try Cream pies: Chocolate Banana Coconut Raspberry Strawberry Fruit pies: Apple Cherry Peach Peach Mango Berry Berry (Raspberry, Blackberry & Blueberry) They also have Sandwiches and a special pie offer with a sandwich.  Next time we try the Chicken Pot pie & peach-mango."}
{"text":"I drove many miles to try this place because they said they had shepherd's pie.  Well, they don't.  They have cottage pie.  IT IS NOT THE SAME THING.  Shepherd's pie is made with lamb and cottage pie is made with beef.  They have completely different flavor profiles.   How would you act if you went for a burger, and after saying you didn't like the taste, they told you it was goat?    Then, after deciding I might as well try it since I had driven so far, the meat was burned.  It was not just crisp.  It was not just over cooked.  It was black and tasted like charcoal.    The crust was not burned so it was not in the oven too long.  Whoever cooked the beef had to have seen and smelled that it was burned and used it anyway.  I would not go out of my way for this place."}
{"text":"Pies N More is on the s/w corner on Baseline and Power.  I loved Marie Callenders pies but they left AZ and now I have found Pies N More and it is delicious. Banana cream pie was served at my Bunco night.  One bite and you are hooked.   I'm picking up two pies for this weekend - girls weekend in Pine...  Enjoy..."}
{"text":"I'm surprised by the negativity of the other reviews, but perhaps this place is better when you call ahead of time and set up a tasting. We were looking to place an order for about 14-15 pies for our wedding. I asked to try five flavors - the chocolate peanut butter, the berry berry, the chocolate raspberry, the coconut, and blackberry raspberry. They had all of them ready for me when I arrived, and they did not charge for the tasting. These aren't perfect pies - the judges on the Great British Baking Show would fault them for soggy crust in the berry pies and imperfect appearance. But seriously, they only charge $13/pie, which is an unbeatable price for good pies. The chocolate peanut butter mousse was particularly delicious, but they apparently don't make it all that often, so you would probably want to call ahead to order that one. I found the couple that runs it charming, and they were certainly very friendly to me."}
{"text":"Every time I walk in nobody says hi, they never have much of a pie selection and the place is a mess."}
{"text":"Sad to report we will not be returning to this place. There were only two other customers when we arrived. No one greeted us we did not know if we were to set down to order or go to counter.  Eventually someone from the back came to take our order my wife ordered a half sandwich and soup and cherry pie with ice cream. I had pot pie and apple pie. My wife's order arrived within 5 minutes along with her pie and ice cream. That's right they brought it all at the same time! By the time she finished her sandwich/soup the ice cream had mostly melted. She said her lunch was just okay.  She liked the pie and said crust was fabulous. As stated I ordered pot pie, my wife finished her lunch and most of her pie when the gentleman behind counter ask how our lunch was I said I still hadn't received my order. By this time 35 minutes had gone by since I ordered. He said pot pie should \"only take a couple of minutes\" Someone had placed it somewhere behind the counter. He handed it to me and said \"sorry about that\" by that time pot pie was merely warm, crust was delicious rest of ingredients were just so so. Pie was ok, crust outstanding. We left and no one even said \"thank you\" or anything else.  If this place is still open in a few months I will be shocked."}
