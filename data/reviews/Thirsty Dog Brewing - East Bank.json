{"text":"Great beer selection and love the fact that they have the beer pairings right on the menu. Good selection of food that does well with the beer crowd. Wife loved her food however my pretzel crusted chicken had a little too much cooking time. Came out slightly over done on the crust, which has a tinge of black to it. This resulted in tasting a charred taste and dried out chicken. (My fault I did not send it back) I would go back for the beer alone but would avoid the pretzel crusted chicken. That was the big disappointment of the day. However, staff, beer selection and wife's meal made up for my charred chicken and wasted money."}
{"text":"The beer was amazing. Great place, great atmosphere. However $18 for a meat and \"cheese\" board is insane. This \"board\" came with two meat selections and goat cheese. That should be an $8 meat and cheese board...I would gladly pay $18 for this if it had multiple cheeses on it."}
{"text":"I went for lunch opening day.  I've never been to their other locations, so didn't know what to expect.  Super friendly service.   The burger was pretty good.  The chips on the side were gross.  I thought the banquet style table and chair setup was weird but maybe that's their thing.  The outdoor bar looks amazing and should be a hot spot once the winter is over.  I don't drink so I'll let others review the beers."}
{"text":"Went on a Tuesday evening. All Nighter burger was great. Flatbread was average.  Stars of the evening were the beers and the hostess, Sam.  She was enthusiastic, friendly, and proud of the Thirsty Dog, as was the rest of the staff.  Will definitely go back!"}
{"text":"This is a great spot for 30+ drafts, food and fun! Newly open, upscale pub food with delicious burgers, brats, sausage and salads. Very friendly staff. We will be back soon."}
{"text":"Cool space but services was very slow and inconsistent even when not busy.  I've been here twice with the same results, I thought I've give them a second chance...  It's also been the same server, Tyrone.  He cannot do two things at once (deliver drinks and take orders) which contributes to his slowness.  He also forgets to put in orders or the kitchen messed something up on our last visit. Our pretzel app took 45 min and came out 25 - 30 minutes after other people's lunches in our party. No apology just excuses.

On our first visit he \"hooked us up\" with a free app that he proceeded to charge me for. I was in a rush thanks to his inattentiveness and he couldn't back it out without a managers approval who was conveniently busy for the next 15 min.

I cannot recommend base on service."}
{"text":"Have enjoyed Thirsty Dog beer for a long time.
Was excited that they were coming to Cleveland

Beer is great ... selection is awesome.
Food selection is average at best - limited menu ... usual pub grubb"}
{"text":"The service was really good including our server Ty who was very friendly. The food was ok. The beer good as they seemed to have all their beers on tap. And that's what we mainly came for. What I didn't like was the total lack of any character. (I guess it goes along with the rest of the east bank vibe now.). It is very generic feeling. Too many TVs. The sitting area feels like a school cafeteria with chairs that seem out of the home depot outdoor patio collection.  The music playing was generic.   I'm just disappointed it didn't have a better and more distinctive thirsty dog brewery feel to it."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and our sleeping-in-the-stroller-two year old landed here while strolling the east bank this afternoon. We ordered wings on the deck. Service was really amazing ! Server anticipated our needs, and never had a lag in time even though she was busy. The wings we ordered were the \"Cuban jerk\" with blue cheese. Beers were a porter and a stout. Very good as well! Perfect place to people, boat, and water watch. Nice lazy Sunday afternoon."}
{"text":"Beer samplers are so cute come served on a bone shaped platter. I have had some of their beers before and 12 dogs is a favorite of mine. All the beers on my sampler were good! Most of us didn't eat but I tried some of the loaded fries- I thought they were okay, I would want to come back and try more. Large bar and space, very modern and a good place to hang out with a group or grab a drink with just a friend at the bar. Only complaint I had was it was a little warm the day we went - noticeably warmer than other bars we had gone to."}
{"text":"Was there on opening day, service was slow and not very knowledgeable,  but to be expected, 41 taps of their delicious beer, can't say enough about there barrel aged stuff, excellent! Ordered the hot chicken sandwich, was very good spicy fried chicken tenders\" Came on a brioche bun lettuce and tomato on the side, but should not be advertised as hot chicken, as in \" Nashville hot chicken\" not even close. I return the following week on a Saturday very busy sat at the bar again bartender I had was very knowledgeable about the beers. Will be returning again this weekend. Maybe I'll try another food item off the menu. Cheers!"}
{"text":"The loaded fries and Bri are amazing!! She made sure everything we ordered was correct and yummy AF. Shout out to Bri for the amazing recommendation it was worth it!"}
{"text":"We stopped in the East Bank area for a local festival and went in to Thirsty Dog for dinner. Yes, they were busy - lots of people there to watch the basketball game. After 20 minutes, we wondered where our food was. After 25 minutes we found our waitress. She said \"I told you we were running slow.\" No, she hadn't. She said she'd check on our food. We never saw her again. Instead, a manager came and said we're really backed up but I'll check on your order. He doesn't return until 15 minutes later and says maybe in 10 minutes but he didn't know. Mind you, this 40 minutes after we had ordered. Nothing offered to us - no complimentary beverages, or a quick appetizer - nothing. We left after 45 minutes. One of the worst experiences in a restaurant I've ever had."}
{"text":"Thirsty Dog is one of my favorite local breweries. I did not realize they have started making SO MANY beers though! It was really fun to go through the menu where you can order either full size or a sample size.  In Akron, there were just a few to choose from (ok ok that was 3 years ago so maybe they have more available now too). The set up of this place is beer hall style. We had great service which I was worried about because they just opened and things are usually a bit screwy at first, but our server was very attentive! 
I am so happy they serve food now! We ordered several appetizers. Poutine and pretzel plate were delicious! The wings were fine, but it listed them as smoked wings--I'm pretty sure they are just thrown on the grill for a few. We also had sauer kraut balls and fried pickles. I normally do not like fried pickles but I enjoyed these, I think because they are so small that it was easy to have a crispy outside but still pickled (not overbearing) inside. 
The patio looks like it will be so great in the summer, I kind of wish they would have fire pits to do some 12 dogs wintery events out there too! I'm the meantime I look forward to trying the main menu and even more beers!"}
{"text":"On vacation in Cleveland and have been trying out MANY of the craft brew pubs. Went in on a very quiet lunch. The inside is large and open.. with the actual brewing equipment still wrapped up in plastic (I wish I lived in the area and could check it out when it's up and running) they offer quite the variety of beers.. something for everyone. I also enjoy that you can pick different pour sizes as it's nice to taste different ones. Menu also has something for everyone. The bartender was pleasant and gave some great advice about the beers as well as some local spots to check out."}
{"text":"We sat here for 20 minutes didn't even get so much as water or an acknowledgement. So much better options in the area."}
{"text":"I've been here a handful of times already and 90% of those experiences have been enjoyable. My only complaint is that, when they're busy, they lose focus on the customers a little. The food is good, the beer list is excellent and Jason (our favorite waiter) is kind as can be!"}
{"text":"Absolutely amazing selection of beers. So many one off and barrel aged beers. A great open atmosphere and large bar with a lot of tvs. The outdoor patio may be the best in the flats. The food is great for bar food but only second to the beer. If you love beer this is the place to go. The only con would be please have more less cut your mouth overly crunchy bread with your bruschetta board"}
{"text":"Cool, new spot for Thirsty Dog. I really like the area and the space they have and the large bar too. The beers are pretty tasty and they do offer flights which is nice. 

The only thing that bugs me here is some of the beer pricing. $15+ snifters for a BA beer? Maybe put it in an 8oz glass so I can buy it for $8-9 instead and I'd be way more inclined to."}
{"text":"We visited Thirsty Dog on a Tuesday night around 5pm and were surprised to find the place empty. We went ahead and ordered two different four flights, and while we enjoyed our drinks nothing was excellent. The atmosphere in the bar is nice, bright and fun... but the staff was a little lackluster. It took a while to put in a food order, and I would've ordered a full pint after my flight had I been given the chance... but after waiting for sometime after our food arrived, I decided to forgo the pint. Overall we will probably be back to Thirsty Dog but it's definitely not my first brewery choice in Cleveland."}
{"text":"We ordered appetizers and put in an order. An hour and a half later we were told that our order was accidentally given to another table that closed out. Awful service. Do not recommend to anyone."}
{"text":"I visited Cleveland in August and was excited to see a Thirsty Dog being built on the east bank of the Flats, so I was even more excited to come back in December and see that it was open. 

Unfortunately, I visited in December, so it was cold and snowy. But it looks like they are building a fantastic out door patio overlooking the river, which will be awesome in the summer. 

The inside is big with plenty of room to accommodate a big party. And they have a great selection of on tap beers (30+), mostly Thirsty Dogs own brews, but they do have a few guest taps. I had a flight of some of their barrel aged beers, which are a bit more pricey, but well worth it!

It was also nice to see they had a good food menu, which separates this location from the brewery in Akron, since they don't offer food. I tried the perogies, which were average. But others in my party had the sauerkraut balls, which were very tasty with their mix of sauerkraut and corned beef, a flat bread (which were half off the day we visited), and their loaded kettle chips - very cheesy and great bar food. 

Overall, the beer was awesome and the food was decent. I can't wait to come back in the summer and enjoy a few brews on the patio!"}
{"text":"Stopped in here a few times since they opened. They have a large selection of brews and a decent menu. The servers are very friendly and knowledgeable. The beer selection is great but pricey. I ordered a burger and a beer $20 total, the burger came with house made chips and pickle for $10. My friend ordered the pretzels and they were fantastic."}
{"text":"The hubs and I came here after a dinner in the flats. We both were very familiar with Thirsty dog's beer, but hadn't yet seen the new brick and mortar in the flats. Immediately when we walked in we were greeted by a server who kindly showed us a table and we informed her we were just here for some brews. Our waiter quickly came over with menus, which were filled with many beers on draft. My personal favorite is always 12 dogs of Christmas. And I was told I got the last of it for the season, sorry not sorry! 
My husband chose the thirsty dog pineapple IPA. It was incredible! I obviously had to try it, for research purposes, and it was amazing. Not too hoppy, a perfect blend of pineapple and hops! Their patio space seems amazing and such great views of the water. Will definitely check it out again, get some food, and enjoy their amazing outdoor space."}
{"text":"A group of us stopped in while working downtown for a late lunch. Having two children with us we picked furthest from the bar. We were given two children's menus (that included misspelled crossword puzzles and no crayons). After awhile, the waitress stopped by asking if we were ready to order or if we needed a few more minutes. I had to ask if it would be possible to put in our drink order first, as we had been there awhile and no drink order was taken. Throughout our time there we asked for things that were forgotten or took way beyond reasonable time, especially since it was quite dead. I ordered the bruschetta app and found that the portion of pita was quite smaller than the toppings and asked if it was possible if I could order an extra side of pita. The waitress stated that she \"asked yesterday and was pretty sure (she) was told no, but (she'd) ask anyway\". She finally returned with dinner and said she could for a $1.50 more, which wasn't an issue. I continued to wait, and wait and wait. It wasn't until we were all done, every person at the table, and awaiting our check did the waitress return with the pita for our appetizer.. I explained that we were actually done with dinner at that point and were just in need of the check. She Walked away and returned with the check... that had the pita on it. Although a small amount that wasn't much, it was just one example from our less than impressive experience due to the lack of service, attention and promptness displayed by our waitress in the almost empty bar."}
{"text":"Catalina and patio bartender/ brewer Bri are the Fk'n BOMB!!!!!! They both went ABOVE AND BEYOND to service us tonight!!!!!!! Would be back because of them! Thanks ladies for an awesome experience!!"}
{"text":"Cool outdoor bar . I'll never u derstand why breweries don't carry American domestics . Having bud light and miller lite on your menu isn't a crime . Rocky River brewing company does and i think it's very progressive of them . They don't judge people for their beer tastes . The hot dog and sausage menu is cool and the outside bar is awesome ."}
{"text":"You ever gone somewhere hoping to it was one kinda place but actually it was another? This place was exactly that. The word brewery doest really explains the situation. This place should be called thirsty dog restaurant with these expensive ass beers that we charging import prices for as if we not making them in the next room. How do u justify a beer costing 15 dollars, then how do u have a bunch of them. Then how does in not come with the glass. On top of that I had to pay 10 to park. The beers are good but they ain't that good. I could have gotten a whole growler from platform plus had a couple beers in the cost to just be in this place and get 2 snifters. Oh did I say that the 15 dollar beers were snifters. Well yeah they were.  I can't even get a whole pint for 15...word.  How do u justify this. The beers in this place cost the same amount as the specialty drink at punch bowl around the corner. The food was meh. Nothing was worth the expensive price. I guess if ur just trying to do something down town to say u did. Then go for this place. But I have gone to a many breweries and this place failed at it. Like they didn't even bottle the beer they made it right there In that room right there then poured it in my glass and charged me as if I bought it in Europe.  I wonder if it's like this at the one in Akron. I might have to find out."}
{"text":"I haven't been to The Flats in thirty-five years. Thirsty Dog brought us back. 

We traveled from Toledo to meet the in-laws for lunch. We don't get a lot of Thirsty Dog in Toledo, but they have a great reputation. 

Their beer is great. The restaurant had maybe 30 to choose from. Especially like the stouts and porters. Food was also very good. I had the kielbasa and pierogis. My wife had the meatloaf. We had pretzels as an appetizer. Which is a must. Apple fritter for dessert. Which was decent."}
{"text":"Recently opened and with an amazing variety of beers on draft, service was prompt and courteous. I loved their veggie burger (one of the best I've had) and for appetizer we had the sauerkraut balls that were scrumptious. This place will be the place to be  at during the summer. I'll come back pretty soon foo shoo."}
{"text":"Went there with a friend to watch playoff football. There was one bartender and maybe 8 patrons. He took his time engaging with each of them in conversation, which I personally like in a bartender. 

Beer selection is good and brewed in-house. A bit expensive but otherwise good.  

I got the loaded potato flat bread. It was an excellent mixture of flavor. Defenite recommend.

Overall, this is a neat additional to the flats. Check it out if you want a nice, more low key (read: family friendly) environment."}
{"text":"Fantastic beers can be found here. This location is nestled right in the flats and gives you a nice view of the city and the Cuyahoga River. The outdoor bar is massive. I've had most of their beers and every one is good. I'm a fan of their bloodhound orange IPA! Definitely worth a visit if you are in the area!"}
{"text":"Good atmosphere although some spots are too bright.  Wait staff always in a hurry and rushing you to get an order in, I am not ordering bud light I do not know what I want yet, give me some time.

In any case when the beer showed up it was almost as described.  I wish they served you water automatically to wash down in between tastings."}
{"text":"Holy large portions!  was pretty impressed with this place and I am looking forward to going back. Came here for dinner around 6 on Saturday before a show. It was definitely not very crowded at all which was nice. The setup is really nice and the large windows allow you to see the river (which was frozen solid). We ordered the poutine to start, and oh my goodness it was gigantic. I felt really bad as we had ubered down so we were unable to take leftovers with us. I loved the gravy and the fries were perfectly crisp. My main course was the caprese burger and a side of the beer cheese soup. The burger wasn't mind blowing but the beer cheese soup was pretty phenomenal. I ordered their specialty whiskey sour drink which was delicious. My husband really liked the fried chicken sandwich he ordered. Overall good food, great beer selection and a great addition to the flats!"}
{"text":"Great bar food and beers. Beautiful setting on the east bank of the Cuyahoga River. Ask for Tom he'll take great care of you. This is a winner."}
{"text":"I'm not happy at all. The food was good. But the service sucks!!! I'm vegetarian and ordered the margarita pizza, they put meat on it after I asked the waitress more than three times if there was meat. Her replies were: \"idk let me check\" \"yeah, I'm not sure\". Just not satisfied at all."}
