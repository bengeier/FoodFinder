{"text":"This is a terrific \"local\" place. The menu isn't expansive and that's part of the charm. The food is about is very good and I've never been disappointed (been there dozens of times), it's clean and service is quick. They are friendly, even going around to the \"children\" tables and challenging them to \"Texas Trivia\". I take my out of town friends there.  This is a best reason for overnight guests! The catfish is the best.... really... the best."}
{"text":"I ate the chicken fried steak with mashed potatoes and gravy.  It was delicious and the chicken is as big as a plate and you get two.  My boyfriend received a steak sandwich and we were both unimpressed.  It was dry meat strips on bread with a tiny bit of sauce.  He had to ask for a side of BBQ sauce and it came as a warm pourable liquid so putting it on the sandwich made the bread soggy.  The decor is cool if you like truck stops and what you \"think\" Arizona is supposed to be and lots of elderly people.  We will not be back."}
{"text":"Our waitress was Donna. The service was good Ole TX hospitality. It was a great evening thanks to Donna and the crew at TXAZ grill made it great."}
{"text":"Tex Az is a one of our favorite places to take/meet up with people in Central Phoenix...especially folks from out of town that are thinking that Arizona restaurants should be in a saloon-type atmoshere to be considered \"local\".  

We take the newbies from out of town here pretty frequently.  It seems alot more \"genuine\" to most than going to a place like, say, Rawhide.
  
I grew up on a cattle farm...and KNOW good steak.  The steak we get at Tex Az is well aged and has great flavor.  The cut, in my expereince, is usually great, as well.  No disappointments there.  (try the NY Strip) Presentation is basic, but isn't that what you would expect? You are not paying Ruth's Chris' prices, right?

Best appetizer--Their chili!  it is VERY tasty and very hearty.  Best dessert--the bread pudding.

While the chicken fried steak used to be our favorite non-plain-steak entree--we have recently converted to the fried chicken.  It is very good. 
With both \"chicken fried\" dishes,  the left-over reheating capability is pretty important since you get SO MUCH food...so the chicken wins out on this one..the Chicken reheats much better than the chicken fried steak.  

The atmosphere is...well...it is UNIQUE...and isn't that what you want in your local saloon/steak house.  :0)  The service is equally as local/quirky.  We consider it ambiance and character. I don't think we have ever wanted for beverages in all of the times we have been there, as a note.  

Parking can be a bit challenging on a busy night..but it all adds to the \"charm\".  

We have likely been to Tex Az about 25 times over the years.  Not once were we disappointed...but we know what we are signing up for.  

This isn't gourmet--a spear of asparagus would not dare show its face at Tex Az--but it is traditional type hearty Old West fare and the flavor is simple, yet great!!!"}

{"text":"CHICKEN FRIED - CHICKEN FRIED - CHICKEN FRIED - CHICKEN FRIED - STEAK!!!!  WHITE GRAVY!! 

I was pleasantly surprised the first time I ordered this dish a few years back - didn't have a lot of hope that the gravy would be \"right\" - boy was I wrong!  I have not stopped going back!! A girlfriend and I go for lunch and we can split the portion - it is huge!  The dinner portion is off the charts!  Everything is right about this dish - the steak is so tender and the crust so crispy - and the gravy - well, Grandma would be envious!!!"}
{"text":"Love love love this place. We have been frequenting this place for about 10 years. It is a neighborhood staple. The food is always consistent, as is the service. The menu is small: steaks, chicken, shrimp, etc. They are famous for their chicken fried steak. I'm not a fan personally but that's just due to my taste buds. I've recommended the dish to many people who loved it. 

Recommendation when ordering the chicken fried steak at dinner, ask for the lunch portion. It's a little smaller and you are more likely to be able to finish it. The dinner portion could feed a family of 4! 

The filet is my fav but the strip is just as fab. If you make it to dessert the bread pudding is phenomenal. Ask for it a-la-mode. It has a whiskey sauce drizzled over it and it comes out very hot so the ice cream evens the temp out a bit. 

If you haven't been here yet, you need to check it out. There is so much stuff on the walls that you always have something to look at. Great place for families and they can accommodate large parties (maybe not 25, but 8-15 definitely!)"}
{"text":"I have always driven past this place leaving from school and have always wanted to try it. Finally tonight I did and it was excellent. I went in and loved the atmosphere. Was greeted with a friendly smile by our waitress Nicole, who by the way is an incredible waitress. The service was impeccable, we never had to worry about our drinks being refilled, our food was out quickly, and everything was cooked to perfection. For the price, you can not beat the food. I was definitely pleasantly surprised and will be sure to come back here often. The place is great, the food was great, and Nicole was great. Thank you!"}
{"text":"Always a must every time we visit Phoenix. The chicken fried steak is as good as anywhere we've dined throughout the south.The atmosphere reminds us of the honky-tonks in Nashville, Tn. minus the dance floors and live music. Servings are gigantic, the food is cooked to perfection, icy cold beer and nothing but friendly prompt sevice. Nothing pretentious, simple down home cooking, reasonably priced. What's not to like if you're in the mood for comfort food."}
{"text":"I was in town for one night and stumbled upon The Texaz Grill online.  The planets must have been aligned just right because I had a great meal.  I ordered the Rib eye with mashed potatoes and a salad.  Everything was very tasty and filling.  I highly recommend this place.  The staff was friendly and efficient."}
{"text":"Brazos Burrito and Shiner Bock!  It doesn't get much better than this in Phoenix if you're from Texas.  Chicken fried steak is amazing and the customer service rocks!"}
{"text":"Texaz is it! 

Some of the best dining you'll ever have. Great service, great food great atmosphere. This is the place I miss when I travel. 

Chicken fried chicken is amazing! Mashed potatoes are wonderful and gravy is perfect! 

They feed you. No BS. 

My favorite place!"}
{"text":"My boyfriend is kind of a down home, \"we love Amurrica\" kind of guy, It's part of his charm, it's what I love about him, but the kind of cuisine that accompanies this quality isn't my cup of tea. I rarely eat red meat. I avoid fried foods whenever possible. That being said, I like to see my man happy - a knife in one hand, a fork in the other, and a big plate of Western goodness between the two. 

TEXAZ seemed perfect. I read reviews, (not on Yelp, unfortunately), scoped out the location, and surprised him by taking him there a few months ago. 

I, for one, loved the atmosphere. It was loud, a little rowdy, and filled to the ceiling with junk! An eclectic assortment of ephemera clung to the walls, accented with knick-knacks and taxidermied animals here and there. Imagine the inside of an Applebee's, except 10 times darker and decorated with items people actually accumulated over time, not stuff that came out of some corporate \"wacky interiors!\" starter kit. 

The waitress was pleasant, but inattentive. The portions were huge, but bland. Even the biscuits were especially boring, and it's hard to make a buttermilk biscuit any more boring than it naturally is, just by existing. I tried to score some honey mustard to liven up my tasteless chicken entree, but no go - no sauces were available! What?! Even my boyfriend seemed less than thrilled by his big ol' meaty hunk of meat, served with a side of some bland starch or another. My boyfriend also found the beer selection to be lacking, but I can't vouch for the accuracy of this observation as I do not care about beer in the slightest. 

For what it was, it was pricey. I felt like we could've gone to almost any other sit-down restaurant in a 2 mile radius and had a better experience for less cash. 

We left full, but with nothing good to say other than \"my, that was a lot of food.\" Hardly ringing praise for a $50+ dinner bill. I don't think we'll be back...the lure of the 1970s concert posters and deer skulls isn't enough to justify a second visit."}
{"text":"Texaz Grill never disappoints.  It's my boyfriends favorite and we went there for his birthday and had another great meal.  I like that they keep the menu simple and execute it very well.  I like that it's unapologetically a meat and potatoes place - if you're looking for a light meal, this is not the place to go.  The portions are generous, especially the famous CFS.  I really love the house salad.  I had the NY Strip - cooked perfectly.  I was also happy to see they have my new favorite vodka - Deep Eddy - on the drink menu.  I'm sure we'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"The food was delicious, all of us thought so. My husband is a country fried steak guy and he loved it. I had country fried pork chop ....yummy. Very cheap delicious  eating . Super service. Easy to get into the building . WE were visiting so I am not sure about all the meals they offer. Give it a try!"}
{"text":"This place is just my speed. Not pretentious, not overpriced just realllllllly good chicken fried steak. Whenever I go, someone gets the fried chicken & someone gets the chicken fried steak and we share because the portions are GINORMOUS (sp?) . The house salad dressing is my absolute favorite dressing out there. One thing to watch out for, they serve the beer in little itty bitty glasses which somehow makes me drink more....maybe thats why I always leave there happy. Prices are very reasonable and service is perfect. They are there to feed you and let you get on with your night!"}
{"text":"Ehhh it was okay ... I guess I didn't get the memo about the chicken fried steak , I order something else and it wasn't all that ... bartender was cool overall cool place just needs to more on menu"}
{"text":"Sorry. This has been my favorite \"don't worry about the calories\" place for the night because it's worth the splurge....BUT... Menu prices increased, plates and portions got smaller, recipes changed for the worse and I was served catfish that was SO undercooked that it was disgustingly raw. Yes, they took it off my bill. No, I did not drive my family there for the disappointment. Oh Texaz...go back to the classic restaurant that you were and tell the person that convinced you that smaller portions, higher prices and \"cutbacks\" were to your advantage...that's NOT what made you famous. I don't want to see a Classic become extinct...but...right now you're headed down the same road as the dinosaur..."}
{"text":"If you're ready for your first (or next) heart attack, this is the place!

Was roped into going to this place as our 80 year-old-something family members remembered the CFS fondly.  The last time they visited was before their respective heart surgeries, no joke!   The decor I could deal with, it had its own charm.  And I didn't find the service to be bad as other reviewers.  But the food . . . all of the entrees come with a starter of iceberg salad (smothered in mustard dressing or artery-clogging ranch), or mayo drenched coleslaw, and a basket of rolls.  The buttermilk biscuits were very good.  Then the entrees came.  Giant CFS smothered in more heart-attack inspiring country gravy, accompanied by mashed potatoes with the same gravy.  Tasteless, greasy gravy that had congealed before reaching the table.  The gravy likely consisted of a copious amount of cream and fat. I ordered a decent chicken kabob (only healthy item on the menu, although it did have a butter glaze), and tasteless fried potatoes.  I know, fried potatoes are not healthy, but neither are the mashed potatoes.  All the food needed seasoning--it didn't seem like there was any salt, pepper or anything on a single part of the meal. 

If you have any concerns about your weight, your heart, or your health in general, skip it.  The Vig Uptown is next door and you can score some real food--plus beer on draft, which you can't get at Texaz.   I wish I could say this is an exaggerated review, but it isn't.  Reality bites."}
{"text":"I have been coming here for years, my kids grew up coming here, my Grandkids come here.
The Reason? GREAT food, great service. The staff are very accommodating and will absolutely bend over backwards to make you happy! Feels like home."}
{"text":"I am a Texan.  This place would not be in business in Texas for more than a few months.  The batter for the fried stuff is not crispy enough.  There's also no flavor at all in the batter.  The steaks look absolutely beautiful sitting there, raw, on the shelf.  They just don't put ANY seasoning on them so it's just a big, bland, piece of steak.  The cobbler is not made right either, it has a cake like batter instead of the crispy layer of dough it should have. Oddly enough though, I do and will continue to go back to this place every now and then."}
{"text":"I went here tonight after hearing good things about the place. I was very disappointed. The food servings were large but the food itself was not very good. The Chicken Fried Steak had no real taste at all. It was just bland. The pork chops were good but not great. Salad just a salad and the bread was cold. I do not think I will be going back after spending $46 dollars for so-so food. Very disappointing."}
{"text":"We came out to Phoenix for a little spring training action and a good friend of mine was twisting my arm to give this place a shot.  We finally made it on our way to the airport on our last day and I'm pumped we did.

We started with margaritas, which are out of control.  They are the perfect combination of sweet and citrus.  Truly some of the best margaritas I've had at any restaurant or bar.

For dinner we got the Chicken Fried Steak with fries and the Prime Rib with mashed potatoes.  The steak was good, it didn't have a ton of flavor but the gravy that I slathered on top did.  The Prime Rib was awesome, thick, red, and juicy.  They even brought us out some sour cream because they didn't have horseradish sauce.

Good stuff, I really liked their gravy."}
{"text":"I have been fortunate enough to live in a lot of different places throughout the US including Texas.  I've traveled to all of it's major cities and to many more of the out of the way places.  To walk into Texaz Grill took me right back to being in Texas, which I only left 2 months ago.  From the first sip of a Shiner beer, to the Blue Bell ice cream sticker on the fridge, from floor to ceiling, this place bleeds Texas pride.  When I walked out, I almost expected to find myself in the humidity and heat of the Lone Star state, Texaz Grill could hold it's own versus any long standing place in Texas.

As for the food, couldn't be better.  The portions are large and leftovers are plenty, but it's so good that you may just want to try and eat it all in one sitting.  The Texas chili is right on the mark with how chili should taste.

Set your expectations accordingly when you go to Texaz Grill, this is a down home place where you can relax and enjoy the comfortable atmosphere as well as great food.  If you want crystal glasses and overly dressed waiters, go somewhere else.  If you're from Texas, well then come get a taste of home, if you're from any where else, come experience a real slice of the Lone Star state."}
{"text":"Tried this place for the first time today for lunch.  The decor and feeling of the restaurant is unbeatable.  Takes you somewhere totally out of Phoenix(Texas).  The staff are super friendly and accommodating.  Now, to get to the food.  If you want real food for a good price the lunch menu is amazing.   I guarantee you will not leave hungry.  I had the chicken fried steak and you get two large portions of chicken fried steak a heaping portion of delicious mashed potatoes and corn.  A must have for anyone in the area!!!"}
{"text":"Damn, I thought after all the hoopla this place was supposed to have the BEST chicken fried steaks in Phoenix....IT DOESN T...now I m from Texas and in all my 62 years , i have not had a more greasy,soggy,limp chicken fried steak....YUCK...what a load of crap this thing was. The rest of the place was a  dump..the bathroom had to be shared with employee changing his clothes...small is the word...I would bet you if Gordon Ramsey or the health dept inspected this dump the kitchen would be closed first thing....save your money and time, go back to Texas every now and then, go to the Market Diner on Harry Hines in Dallas and eat a REAL GOOD chicken fried  steak with fresh cream gravy and not that congealed goo from the texaz GRILL...I have had better from roadside vendors but nothing worse than the imitation chicken fried steak this place serves instead.....lazy @#$%'s"}
{"text":"No false advertising here.  Just the best damn chicken fried steak I've had in Phoenix (and BBQ beef ribs, see update).

We also got the bbq pork sandwich which was so mouth wateringly good that I wished Texaz would just go ahead and deliver a full line of bbq items...and stop teasing me with just this one tempting tasty bit

Really generous portions. The sides was just typical..but with the mains this good, I couldn't really care.   My plate was overflowing and my jeans needed loosening after the super yummy and yet easy on the wallet lunch.

Update:

We've been on the hunt for BBQ beef ribs which doesn't seem as popular as pork ribs.  It may not be as tender as pork but the flavor is what we're after.  When we heard that our favorite Texan restaurant serves it only on Tuesday nights, we had to make the trip.

We arrived after 9pm but luckily they still had one order left.   $11 for five giant beef back ribs - slow-smoked over hickory and oak, topped with a homemade BBQ sauce and served with their rustic mashed potatoes. 

The dry spice-rub had so infused into the meat during the long slow cooking process that we didn't need the sauce.  Eating beef ribs is a carnivorous act - almost caveman like - if it wasn't for the fact that the server thoughtfully brought us a warm wet napkin to wipe our saucy fingers on.

Despite the tastiness of the ribs, there was just so much of it that even with the two of us sharing, we could not finish it.  It made for a tasty lunch the day after."}
{"text":"Wow! Great comfort food.  I had the catfish and it was perfectly crispy and delicious.  The service is just as good.  Southern hospitality at its finest!"}
{"text":"We were at Texaz Grill last night for dinner.  My friend wanted the prime rib but it was out, so he got a rib eye which he did not like, (probably because he's not really a steak eater, he said). The owner came to check on us and when he heard that, he suggested we exchange it for a 'small' CFS. I guess 'small' in Texaz means HUGE! It covered the plate and came with some delicious gravy. I'd say that was the best ever CFS. My dinner was the filet which was excellent, big and cooked perfectly.  We also had the shrimp cocktail which was wonderful too. We split the peach cobbler ala mode, which was the perfect end to my friend's birthday dinner. Prices were fair and our server was Great! 
Whenever I am in the Phoenix area I will be sure to come back to Texaz Grill. I wish we had a place like this near Chicago."}
{"text":"Quite simply the best god damn chicken fried steak west of the Mississippi Rover.

Side note the ice cold beer mugs make me feel like I have hands the size of Andre the Giant."}

{"text":"Great place, great food.  There are some slight drawbacks.  The parking spots here during lunch and dinner time are a bit hard to find.  The lighting inside is too dark at times.  The staff and service are exceptional though."}
{"text":"Came here on the spur of the moment while deciding what to eat on a weekend night. It is a very cluttered looking restaurant. There were so many road signs and posters on the wall, I'm really not sure what color the walls were. 

The service was excellent which is why this review is getting 3 stars instead of 2. Our waitress was friendly and quick.

I had high expectations about this place and unfortunately it just did not live up to it. I just found everything to be very bland. Maybe I've been watching too much Chopped but I just expected the food to be better seasoned. Both my wife and I were using a lot of salt to add some flavor to the meals. Not sure I would go again unless someone tells me the food has improved."}
{"text":"Awful service. We went in with a party of 7 on Friday night. The hostess laughed at us saying, \"you expect to be seated on a Friday, for 7? With no reservation? Ha! You're looking at an hour and a half wait.\" Then he chuckled to himself! We didn't even get to eat, we left immediately. It was rude to just assume we knew how busy they would be and that we should've just known ahead of time to make a reservation. Never going back. I am appalled."}
{"text":"My husband and I went here last night for dinner. So amazing! The biscuits and dinner rolls were very delicious too. My husband got the chicken fried steak and I got chicken fried chicken. We both liked mine more, but his was good. The mashed potatoes and gravy are delicious and smothered in gravy...yum! We left room for pecan pie which was very good too. Left with lots to eat today for lunch. Our server Helena was great! Very warm and sweet...the place was very welcoming and homey. Will go back! Great comfort food!"}
{"text":"Best ribeye in the valley.  Nice and greasy.  Just the way I like it.  The mashed potatoes and country gravy are incredible.  I could drink the gravy it is so good.  The pre-meal biscuit is good too.  I have been coming here for over ten years and the servers are the same.  They are very nice and get your food out quick.  This is my favorite place to go in Phoenix."}
{"text":"Lives up to its promise. Giant portions and yummy food, and this is coming from a TX girl."}
{"text":"I am a sucker for great service. The only complain I have would be I wish they included their daily specials in their regular menu. 
My ice tea never went half empty unless I begged them to stop refilling."}
{"text":"I love the food, but wish Restaurant Impossible would come in and completely re-decorate the inside. It's dark, dirty, crowded, and out dated. Get rid of everything off the walls.  Also the parking is a nightmare."}
{"text":"Had one chicken fried steak in my life before this place. Was in Phoenix for two days and came here twice in that time. Amazing Chicken Fried Steak. Delicious Chili. Perfect peach cobbler. If I'm ever within 100 miles of this place, I will definitely come back."}
{"text":"My parents and I went to the Texaz Grill last night - I'm visiting from out of town and they wanted to take me out for a good dinner. We each ordered a drink, they each ordered a steak and I had the chicken fried steak (it should be noted that the chicken fried steak was pretty good!).  The problem was the disrespectful treatment we ended up receiving from the Manager.  

When our food arrived, my Mom's steak was exactly as ordered, but my Dad's steak was the wrong order and was cooked well done (he probably would have graciously ate the wrong order if it weren't for the fact that it was well done... Who orders good steaks well done?)

So we waited about ten additional minutes for him to get the correct order brought to the table. The issue now was that my Mom and I now had two plates of cold food in front of us because we waited for his food to arrive before we started eating.  Fine.  We ate.  Our very nice waitress, Donna, asked if we wanted dessert, we declined (as we were pretty full - dinner was large) and just asked for our bill.

The real challenge came when the bill arrived and we asked (very politely) if they were willing to do something with the bill to make up for the mistake with my Dad's steak and my Mom and I having to eat cold food? Donna went to speak with the Manager and came back with the offer of a free dessert.  But we'd just declined dessert a few moments earlier, so that didn't seem like a good offer - we asked if maybe they could deduct the value of a dessert from our $75 bill? Donna said she'd have to send over her Manager.

A gentleman (the term is being used quite loosely) came over to the table and quite rudely told us \"mistakes happen\" - when my Mom tried to explain that we understood that, he rudely shut her down by saying \"you're not the one who had to wait\" (wrong! We all waited). When I asked him about deducting the value of one dessert from our bill, he actually accused me of trying to \"rob them\"!!  Crazy!

He eventually said he'd deduct the value of my drink from the bill (a $6 margarita) and stormed away from the table.  We were shocked at how rude he was being.

The re-issued bill arrived and, to our great surprise, the drink that was deducted was a $2 beer.

Needless to say, we won't be recommending the Texaz Grill to any of our friends and wanted our Yelp friends to know what happened there last night.  We understand mistakes happen, but we appreciate it when establishments make a bit of an effort to make it right.  REALLY didn't like being accused of trying to \"rob them\"!"}
{"text":"Good, wholesome, simple Comfort Food. 

I've been coming here for a few years. It's the \"spot\" for my brother and I. 
Chicken Fried steak is so big it's folded over on the plate and smothered in gravy. Fried Pork Chops, smothered in gravy are delicious. Ribeye, decent cut of steak for $16. 
Get Coleslaw as your salad and biscuits on the table. Washing it down with Texas' own Shiner Black lager... 
it's a meal fit for a King!"}
{"text":"This is my favorite place in the whole world.

Chicken fried steak is my absolute favorite meal ever and they make it just the way I like it. From the salad with house dressing to the enormous portion of steak and potatoes - I am in heaven.  Plus I love the little chilled glass for my Shiner.

If you homestyle cooking this is your place"}
{"text":"I visited the Texaz Grill yesterday with some friends of mine following a funeral for their infant grandson. We badly needed a break and a place to just sit down, eat, and talk about something else.

When we first entered, the hostess, a blonde older lady, already had a crappy attitude. We'd come in two cars and there was a little confusion about whether my friend's husband and son were already there. The hostess was very snippy with my friend, I suspect because my friend is a larger lady. We let it go.

Brisket sandwiches and some catfish: flippin' awesome. Our actual waitress was nice enough, thankfully. Desserts were consumed in spite of being stuffed from the nice entrees.

When we finished we sat a bit and talked. The hostess approached and brought a bag for the leftover boxes. It was clear she wanted us OUT. My friend asked for water and the hostess said hotly, \"To GO?\" My friend said no, and that hostess was preeeeetty huffy about it. I don't know if she's the owner's wife, or what, but someone who thinks she can behave that way to customers needs to be spoken to."}
{"text":"Great chicken fried steak! Friendly prompt service with a smile. I recommend this Texas style eatery very highly!!"}
{"text":"This native Texan has found a place to call home while traveling!  I now live in Colorado, but travel to Phoenix for work.  I stomped on my brakes and made some tires squeal as I stopped to turn into this place when I was perusing for places to eat.  I'm certainly glad I did.  There are certain health related lines the people of Colorado do not like to cross, and every once in a while I just really want everything deep fried.  

I started off my evening with some Deep Eddy grapefruit vodka on the rocks.  Feeling like home already.  I sat at the bar, and the bartender was very nice and attentive.  She gave me advice on where to stay, what to do, ect.  I ordered fried okra as an appetizer because I miss all things okra.  It was hand battered and not the prefrozen BS you sometimes get at lower tier BBQ joints.  It came with this mustard based sauce which was delicious.  I of course sprinkled some Texas Pete's pepper sauce on top which is how God intended fried okra to be consumed.  

I then moved on to the fried catfish.  I got the cole slaw and salad as a side.  I was a little worried because the catfish isn't corn meal battered like I'm so used to, but it was crisp, delicious, and hit the spot.  I squeezed lemon on top and sprinkled on some zatarains seasoning blend, and gave it a good dunk in the tartar sauce.  I ordered the lemonade drink special which featured titos vodka, prickly pear syrup, lemonade, and bubble water.  It was very refreshing and complimented my dinner.  

This will be my watering hole every time I come into Phoenix.  Definitely worth the stop."}
{"text":"It pains me to write this. I am a Texan, a Houstonian. I was raised on chicken fried steak and moved to Phoenix two decades ago with cream gravy in my veins. I know full well what a good cat fish dinner taste like and no one can tell me that Blue Bell is \"ok\". I first found Texaz Grill when it was Texas Grill - before they were forced to change the name. That said, I have been eating here for a very long time and they are - had been - the next best thing to the real thing when it comes to chicken fried steak. That hot plate of the golden mother-load was satisfying and warming to a home-sick soul. I think I may have cried the day I came in, sat at a booth and saw the placard on the table that simply read, \"We now carry Blue Bell Ice Cream\". That's been some time now. 

I moved away a few years ago but for whatever reason I have to return to Phoenix, Texaz Grill is a no-brainer. About a year ago I ordered the usual CFS and we were a little surprised to find the meat was tough. Before, all you needed was a fork and maybe a knife for good manners. We wrote it off as a fluke but then the next time, a few short months later, another order in town and it was ... weird ... chewy. What happened to the melt-in-your-mouth CFS this place has been warmly bringing out for ages? I began to wonder if there has been a change of suppliers for their meat, a new cook overdid it - denial and love for some Texas home cooking kept me silent and I went back again. The catfish had always been a winner, my S.O. ordered that and it turned out to be the better meal. Wow. I was so sad. 

A few months passed, enough for us to forget, so here we were this week after anxiously watching family and friends go through Hurricane Harvey, I wanted nothing more than a Texaz Grill CFS & gravy to hug my soul. 

...sigh... I cannot recall having to fight so hard to get a piece of meat to tear away so I can swallow it without fear of choking on the tendon strings. 
Me with a knife: cut, cut, cut, cut, CCUT, CUTT,,, CUT. Then literally grabbing one end with my teeth, the other ripping it with my hand to get it to split so it is safe to chew. And chew, and chew, and chew, and chew... . We didn't finish it. This is *NOT* a ~Texas~ chicken fried steak. It was like Denny's wishing it was. But the catfish, as always, was good. 

I am so, so, disappointed. This is the forth time, so this is no longer a fluke. I do not know what has happened over there but Texaz Grill, you need to know that whoever is supplying your meat these days, I would take it under serious consideration to look into them a little deeper. Maybe it's the prep that has changed - I don't know but something changed with the CFS and not for the good. Again, I am from Texas and we know meat. This stuff is bad. Really bad. After nearly choking on tendon-like strings (on two different occasions) that wouldn't tear, also the very thought of so many tendon-like strings in my mouth really grosses me out, I'm wondering what exactly is this 'meat' that I'm eating???

Honestly, I'm sorry, but after several overlooks and tries I have to resign myself to the truth: I am an old-school customer and a Texan so I know what this place used to cook when it came to chicken fried steak and I know how it *should* be cooked. But the truth is, it's terrible and I no longer feel safe eating it. Anyone who is new to this place and not well versed in a properly cooked, tender Texas Chicken Fried steak will be in 'awe' of the plateful and love it and maybe those are your new customers who don't know any better. But for folks like me who miss our mama's home cooking and greasy hole-in-the-wall local restaurants serving it up as it's meant to be and sometimes just need a \"I hate you Hurricane Harvey\" hug, I'll have to wait until i get back home again cuz i give up. 

Good luck."}
{"text":"This place is AMAZING!! Best steak I have had in awhile, their chicken fried chicken is great and don't even get me started on their mashed potatoes and gravy!! You can't go wrong with anything here and their service is FABULOUS!!"}
{"text":"This is by far the best Chicken Fried Steak around!  Not to mention their mashed potatoe's, salad and biscuit!  I've never been able to clean my plate here, which is great since I always have an extra meal!   Of course you can always get the lunch portion which is smaller, but then you don't have the extra goodies for later!  

It's a small down home place, dress comfy and go there to eat up!  The wait staff is always the best and they know their stuff!  

I've had their T-Bone here, and it's good, but really hard to go there and not get what made them famous!  Wonderful food!

Prices for lunch are around $7.00 and dinner around $12.00 - really hard to beat for real down home cooking!"}
{"text":"Been coming to TexAz since 1985, back in the \"Lonestar Steak\" days. Never had a bad meal, had bad service just once in all that time, and 23 years later the prices aren't that much higher either. If I'm ever convicted of murder and sentenced to death my final meal has to be the Mulligan prime rib medium rare with mashed potatoes and that to-die-for cream gravy. I take friends here and buy them dinner just to see that look on their face when they see their plate for the first time. I've had everything on the menu except the catfish and all of it is great! I'd write more but I'm hungry now. See you there..."}
{"text":"MMMMMMMMM! Grew up in Texas, so this place is such comfort. 

The good: DELICIOUS food. Love the mashed potatoes and the STEAK - OH MY! Amazing. Great service - very sweet, patient waitresses. You know, the \"what can I get you sweetie?\" kind of waitresses. Gotta love em. The interior is phenomenal and cozy - a little crowded but  actually really cozy once you get settled in. 

The bad: Like I said, it is very crowded. I suggest not going at dinner time. There always seems to be a wait and...there's really no place to wait. Last time I went was about 7:30 PM and there was a long line and we were forced to wait outside, not even close to the front door. Fortunately, not for long! So kudos for that. 

Above all, great atmosphere, great food, great service - HIGHLY recommend if you're in the mood for a lil southern cookin!"}
{"text":"Let's start with, cutting a potato into eight parts, does not french fries make.  I'm not sure about all the hype for this place.  Last night I went and we both had the \"special.\"  It was a New York strip, two Gulf shrimp, artichoke hearts, \"fries\", and rubber sauce.  (can't remember what they called it)...but the whole way home we kept saying, how do we get this taste out of our mouths?  Not exactly my idea of a good way to leave a restaurant."}
{"text":"This is my favorite !    I mean it.  I always bring out of towners here.  Go for lunch, which is served until 4pm.  It's hard to beat the price for lunch.  And, you may have a tough time eating it all.  If you happen to stop by between 3pm and 6pm, it's happy hour.   The servers are nice and friendly.    I'm glad I do not live close to this place... .. .. .. .. .. OOOooooooooo it's so good."}
{"text":"I had the fried pork chops , the chops were perfect . Nice crust and very moist. It came with cream gravy and mash potato. Oh yeah it came with two chops . Service was friendly and efficient."}
{"text":"Great service, great price!!! I love this place!! Hidden treasure!! The prime rib sandwich was the best I ever had!!! The biscuits and gravy was the best and greatest taste!! I love the fun, friendly atmosphere!!!"}
{"text":"I absolutely love this place. They have the best prime rib I've ever tasted and the prices are cheap for the portion size. The waitresses are very friendly and the whole atmosphere is family friendly and enjoyable."}
{"text":"Food is pure fat and yumminess. One plate is enough to feed three people. We had more leftovers than we knew what to do with. Definitely need to fast for a week before coming here, but well worth it."}
{"text":"The food is delicious and the service is amazing. Helena is one of the best servers I have ever had the privilege of serving us. We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Oh how I love this place. The food is fantastic and you diffently get plenty of it! This is the only place to go in Arizona for chicken fried steak. My girlfriend had the rib-eye lastnight and it was pretty good, but like I said this place is best known for the chicken fried steak and mashed potatos."}
{"text":"Great BBQ.  I have had the lunch pulled brisket twice.  It's served with an addicting sauce that is smokey and delicious.  You will be looking for more condiment vehicles once your tasty homefries have been snarfed.  The waitstaff is mostly female and fun.  Think saucy middle aged ladies that could probably make you blush with a dirty joke if provoked.  Let's get this straight, I did not hear a dirty joke (wanted to), so your kids are safe here.  The young humans will probably love the multitude of nick-nacks, chotchkies and regalia on the walls.

Lunch was less than $10 with H2O."}
{"text":"I always pass by this place on my way to the gym and I finally decided to stop on in and check it out. At first when walking in I saw nothing but Texas stuff posted on the walls all sorts of arrangements so I obviously thought things were gonna be super delicious and I was eager to order. I order chicken fried steak as most reviews here are explaining the incredible taste of it. 

Upon receiving my order I was kinda disappointed it was a huge portion which was great but I did not find much of a flavor to it. Overall I think this place is ok I personally would not go out of my way to eat here and after all don't take my word for it go out and try it."}
{"text":"Yummy comfort food!! They have SMOKED PRIME RIB!!! Never had that before and it was amazing!!! Worth the drive for sure!"}
{"text":"Went to diner with friends. We ordered 3 specials (liver and onions) shrimp cocktail and a diner salad. I've been a server for some years and I gotta say walking into a busy restaurant like this one you expect to wait but nope! We were sat immediately and the waiter promptly greeted us. He coursed out meal perfectly which is hard. But the food!!!!! Was so amazing!!! I thought I hated liver and onions but now thanks to this restaurant I'm a huge fan."}
{"text":"If your yearning for some down home TX food then this is the place!  Nothing says TX better than good 'ol Chicken Fried Steak and Mashed Potatoes with the skins on and this place has both!  Oh, they have steaks, hamburgers, BBQ, and chicken friend chicken too, but the Chicken Fried Steak is what they are famous for!  If you order the regular plate you will have MORE than you can eat at one sitting.  I usually order the Lil Tx Steak (or something like that) which is a smaller portion but still PLENTY!  The white cream gravy that is layered over the meat and the potatoes is just the right consistency.  All entree's come with the house salad which is pretty basic....iceburg lettuce with chopped green olives and dressing.  You also get a basket of biscuits and rolls with real butter!  

There is a full bar including some unique beers.  Tonight I had a cocktail made with \"Moonshine\" alcohol distilled at a place right here in Tempe.  I can't remember the name of the cocktail but it was very satisfying!  There were five of us in our party and by the time we were finished eating we didn't have room to get a dessert each so we ordered one peach cobbler with vanilla ice cream and shared it (had we really been hungry this dessert would have only served two), but there was enough for each of us to get out sweet tooth satisfied and it was an excellent finish to a very satisfying meal.  

The ambiance is WAY casual and the service is brisk....no sitting around chit chatting here.  Order, eat, pay and vamoosh!  LOL  Seriously, we had great service and truly enjoyed our evening.  We will be back again!"}
{"text":"Their chicken fried steak is the best, ever. And I'm a Texan! Along with it the mashed potatoes are like mom made them at home-seasoned just right. I assumed I'd get the steak each time I visited this grill full of Texas memorabilia, but then the next time was all-you-can-eat catfish. Oh, my. Possibly some of the best catfish I've ever tasted. Iced tea is also something to write home about. All in all, if you can't eat in Texas, this place is just as good!"}
{"text":"Did this place change ownership? I have been here before and don't remember it sucking so bad. 

Like mentioned in other reviews, the salads were completely overdressed with lettuce looking way past its prime And who serves a salad that consists on only lettuce and two tiny bits of tomato? 
Chicken fried steak was completely flavorless as was the thick gravy on top. 

Nothing is worse than making a decision to go completely unhealthy with your meal selection and it tastes like shit. Stuff that is bad for you should at least taste good. I feel like I was robbed!!"}
{"text":"Atmosphere - great. Service - terrific. Food - blah.

I had the chicken fried steak, it was bland as hell and horrifically greasy. My wife had the chicken kebab - it was at once overdone and yet smothered in butter, apparently to moisten it back up.

If you are at all health-conscious, try another restaurant. If you are from Texas or just like bland, fried food with good beer, this is your place."}
{"text":"Well, our son decided we needed to eat here - we are in town visiting him.  I would have preferred something lighter, but I am telling you that if you want a hearty meal in a very colorful setting  this is the place. 

 The menu is largely steak and fried foods, but you get a salad and potatoes with every meal.  They do give the options on some of the foods - pork chops, chicken, shrimp, fish - to have it grilled if you please.  Special of the day was liver and onions, which we all passed on.  I decided to go whole hog, and got the bear battered fried shrimp, our son got chili as well as two fried chicken breasts (he is a construction worker, so can eat like this), and my husband got the grilled pork chops, with  big sides of grilled onions and grilled mushrooms. 

 The service was excellent and the food very good, although maybe not the best choice for the night before Thanksgiving.   The decor, if one could call it that, was the most fun of all - walls and ceilings plastered with old advertisements (haven't even thought of Nehi in years), letters, pictures, license plates, and on and on.  It was a lot of fun, but back to salad and lighter things.  Except tomorrow for turkey day."}
{"text":"If you have a Texas sized appetite, this is the place for you. Friendly service and eclectic decorations make it a fun family outing. The chicken fried steak and the chicken fried chicken are each enough to feed an army. They are both delicious though, especially with mashed potatoes. The okra is also great to start with. Their chicken kabobs are moist and tender, an alternative to fried food. With texaz, Sharing is caring. Not for dieters!"}
{"text":"Been here many times and I absolutely love this restaurant.  Would totally recommend as the food is great, awesome atmosphere, and the owner is a stand up guy.  I get the chicken fried chicken every time I go and I live it.  The chicken is awesome and very moist, the gravy on top is also to die for. It is very rich and creamy but it doesn't overpower the taste of the chicken.  I would totally recommend this place to anyone looking for a good meal."}
{"text":"Errrthing in Texas IZ big! True to all the reviews, Texaz Grill is indeed a thriving local spot filled with the owners quirky character over its 25+yr history! all the waitresses provide that at home graciousness you'd expect from Aunt May. The food is down home scratch cooking in ginormous Texas portions. You'll likely not need a drink refill either as the water cups could drench 2! 

Fried catfish is succulent and tasty no need for additional seasoning, while their staple chicken fried steak lunch portion could put one under food coma if finished. Great atmosphere and friendly banter keeps this joint alive and having a starbux across the street is extra kudos :)"}
{"text":"I have been here 2 times in the last two months with my family for lunch. The atmosphere in the restaurant is awesome. I love the decor and overall feel of the business. Parking is an issue with larger vehicles but I will do what I have to do so I can get the famous chicken fried steak. As good as advertised. In my two trips to this location I have had to leave food on my plate  because I was stuffed ( this is rare). This is becoming one of my favorite stops."}
{"text":"Great food, great atmosphere!!! Staff is so friendly. Recommend highly!
I haven't had  a great steak like that in a long time.  My husband chicken fried steak was huge 2 pieces said it wasthe best."}
{"text":"If you like humongous portions amazing food, eat here. The CF Steak, CF Chicken, and (especially) CF Pork are amazing! The Prime Rib and Ribeye are also fantastic."}
{"text":"We really wanted to love this place! But the service was so slow and the waitress was slightly preoccupied. Our good wasn't good-order the chili and it was terrible, they did remove it from the bill. The ribs were good though limited side options. 

Seems like a good spot for regulars and tebar looked the bar looked relaxing."}
{"text":"This is not my favorite place, but I am giving them 4 stars since the limited menu has a specialty that couldn't be done any better. Chicken fried steak, chicken, or most recently CF pork chop are all outstanding. The family loves this place and we come back a couple of times per year to get our Chicken Fried on."}
{"text":"The food was GREAT. The bad review is because our server, Jessie (guy), couldn't SLOW DOWN. He walked off before my husband was finished ordering his meal, rushed us to order dessert, and then didn't even pay Austin to myself OR my husband when he was trying to order HIS desert. Just took my order and ignited him completely."}
{"text":"Being from Dallas, Texas, I have a certain standard I hold my Texas food to. And TEXAZ always exceeds it. Best chicken fried steak with the best white gravy. Very Texas dive-y looking. Wait staff will always remember who you are. Quick and amazing. Love them!!"}
{"text":"Steak was flavorless and the chicken fried steak was tough. The mashed potatoes and gravy were delicious though. I won't be returning that's for certain."}
{"text":"Went to Texaz on a whim wanting some steak and we were thoroughly disappointed. I ordered the t-bone, which was small and grey. There was no sear on the steak at all. The filet piece of the steak was about the size of a JFK half dollar. Huge disappointment. My friend got the shrimp dish done on the grill instead of fried. One of the shrimps was raw and they were tiny. Huge rip off for $16. Two stars for friendly service, good potato wedges and biscuits. I would not recommend this place to anyone."}
{"text":"As a Native Texan, it doesn't get any better than this for Chicken Fried Steak or CF Chicken.  Portions are huge, food excellent, and Shiner Bock is the house brew.  Best of all, it's walking distance from the house.   My wife does miss the pulled pork sammiches."}
{"text":"This was my first visit to this restaurant. At first because the parking lot was very tight my initial thoughts were I'm not going to like this.  
It was definitely worth the visit. Staff and food were great.  
My family and I will definitely be back.  We tried the prime rib, and chicken fried steak.  Very tasty."}
{"text":"Best chicken fried steak, I have ever had! My family and I all had steak and it was amazing. Definitely will be back!"}
{"text":"Wasn't that great the steak was not seasoned the shrimp cocktail was not good either I will kit recommend this restaurant to anyone"}
{"text":"My uncle's place, so I can't say anything positive about it without Yelp claiming I'm some kind of shill. Read the decades of reviews on the place - they ain't wrong."}
{"text":"This place is yummy!  The chicken fried steak is the best and the salads and rolls they serve before the meal are also good."}
{"text":"Love the food. You must save your appetite though because the portions are huge! Chicken fried steak is the bomb! Especially with their jalapeño!"}
{"text":"Maybe I should have got the chicken fried steak.  Because that steak I had was something else.  There was so much grease piled on top of my t-bone that I'm pretty sure I'm a likely candidate for the world's youngest triple bypass patient.  I'll admit, sometimes grease makes for good grubbin'.  But not this time.

I went on a Saturday night and there was a little bit of a wait. But our server was plenty kind.  She completely forgot our order of fried okra, but I wasn't feeling too upset about it."}
{"text":"Years ago, this place had some great food! Now, not so much. Chicken Fried Steak is bland, the Salad has very little \"greens\" to it, and the apitizer bread they serve is cold. They used to have the best CFS around, but in the last few years or so, its beaten out by a Denny's dinner."}
{"text":"I have to say that Yelp let me down on this one. It was terrible. There was absolutely no salt on anything and no flavor. Seriously their \"fries\" were not even salted. (And by fries I mean huge hunks of potatoes that are fried) I ordered their special chicken fried steak, and I don't know how they can still be in business if that is what they are known for. 

The beef back ribs weren't very good either."}
{"text":"Like a trip down memory lane. Still as good as I remember it from the late '80's.  The chicken fried chicken is my favorite with tender fried chicken breasts and skin-on mashed potatoes smothered in gravy.  Comfort food at its finest!"}
{"text":"My husband and I came to Texaz for our one year anniversary.  I was craving ribs and he's heard such great things about the CFS.  We didn't eat ALL day because we knew we were going to have a large dinner.

We entered Texaz and (we're not prissy by any means) just looked at each other.  There was a dead bird near the restrooms - my husband has a fear of birds.

I opened the menu and we literally had an option of three different choices of meats and CFS.

Since they didn't have ribs, I ordered the rib eye and my husband ordered the CFS.  I noticed right away that \"they don't season their meats.\"  WTH?  Whatev - there was salt and pepper on the table...and A-1.  Our food came with a salad (iceburg sopping with water) and you had a choice of ranch or some other vinegarette.  We both got ranch and it tasted like mayo with water.  The bread was one of those rolls that you get for Thanksgiving and a piece of French bread.  Nothing impressive that makes you want to binge.

Our food came really fast.  My steak was huge for $16 and so was his CFS.  I think there were two of them.  My steak was alright - even though I had to season it myself and dunk each piece in A-1 sauce.  I tried a bite of the CFS and wasn't impressed.  Mine is a lot better.

Let me mention that their margaritas are really good.  Not too strong but not too sweet.  The waitress was excellent."}
{"text":"The best chicken fried steak  and my husband had the best brisket ever. It was all so so so tender and savory. It was heaven in my mouth. Last but not least, I had the pecan pie.. I had to have a second slice. I have never had better pie in my life, and I have had a lot of different pies from places knows for pie."}
{"text":"Great food fun atmosphere.  Ordered the chicken fried chicken.  I recommend you get the small serving it fills the plate.   Seasoned perfectly and even though deep fried it was very lite and not greasy at all.  My husband got the brisket it was so tender and the smoke taste was phenomenal!  Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"We stopped here for the first time today for lunch on a recommendation from friends. We each had the Texaz club which was hearty and did not disappoint! Big, meaty sandwich and very filling. We noticed the chicken fried steak/chicken plates were being ordered by most of the people around us and looked delicious! One heckuva meal we will try next time. Met the owner who was real nice & made us members of the clean plate club! Look forward to going back and cleaning our plates again in the near future!"}
{"text":"I am a big fan of smoked prime rib.  I've had it at The Stockyards and BobbyQ's and enjoyed their versions very much. I read some reviews that were positive about dining at Texaz Grill and drove from Anthem to try their smoked prime rib. 

I arrived about 6:00 p.m. on a Sunday evening and was seated immediately. I placed my order and was served my iceberg lettuce with rhe house mustard  dressing and warm rolls & butter. So far, so good. About 15 minutes later I was served my entree. The large cut of smoked prime rib was accompanied by mashed potatoes and gravy and a dollop of horseradish sauce on rhe side. The potatoes were tasty but the prime rib ordered medium rare was inedible.  I could barely cut into it as the meat was as tough as shoe leather. I chewed and chewed and it had a subtle smoked flavor but there was so much fat and gristle that I chose to take it home.

The next day I tried to have it for lunch but threw most of it away as it was too tough to chew and swallow.

I spent $30. some dollars for a cut of smoked prime rib that was lousy.

I should have sent it back but I have to say I would not recommend the smoked prime rib and will not be coming to the Texaz Grill again."}
{"text":"I absolutely LOVE this place. It's so delish! Also I'm a college student and I'm always looking for a place to get a lot of food for a great price.  I take my friends here all the time and they agree for  the best food at a great price the Texaz grill is where you wanna go."}
{"text":"chicken fried steak!!!! OMG. this is not the place to go if you are on a diet! Fun atmosphere, all kinds of visuals on the wall. The food is great."}
{"text":"Great good great service. We took are 3 young children there tonight. The customer service was top notch.Waitress help led my children there steak while by wife was busy with our 1 old. Manager came over a few times to entertain them. It just made eating out with the kids more enjoyable"}
{"text":"Omg if you want chicken fried steak then look no further! This is the standard for what chicken fried steak is to be! Don't expect foo foo gluten free menu items this is a true OG Texas style roadhouse food! I've been eating here since I was a kid and remember when it was LoneStar before the lame chain made them change the name but it didn't change the food! I recommend the chicken fried steak and if they aren't sold out on prime rib its a winner! Also on Tuesdays I hear the beef ribs are to die for but in all the years I've been eating there they are always sold out! I'll keep yall posted on that!"}
{"text":"Loooooove this place.  Has the dive feel with really friendly service and patrons and AMAZING food.  We had the chicken friend steak which I would rate the best of my life.  Also had the special mac n cheese of the day with ham and broccoli which was ridiculous!  And sooo reasonably priced. We can't wait to go back but be prepared for some serious caloric consumption!"}
{"text":"I have been eating at TEXAZ Grill for over 10 years and I will keep coming back. Great food, great prices, great service, great everything. The lunch specials are incredibly inexpensive. They have a kids menu, a full bar, and a hands on owner. I love to support local family owned businesses and that's what you get with TEXAZ. A great steakhouse that won't break the bank!

The only thing not great about TEXAZ is the lack of parking which can be rather tight. If you have a large truck or SUV, you don't want to park facing 16th Street, it's too tight and backing out is difficult. Park on the side of the building facing Bethany Home Rd., or in the back where large vehicles can get in and out with ease."}
{"text":"Chicken Fried Chicken. Biscuits and gravy. This place is so good, its not a new place trying to be a  trashy restaurant, it really is a trashy restaurant! Dont expect much but authentic hillbilly good. The chicken fried chicken was unreal....

Should be on diners drive ins and dives (if it hasnt already)"}
{"text":"The food is delicious.  I love this place.  It reminds me of so many BBQ places in Texas.  I feel so at home at this place.  I really enjoy all the memorabilia on the walls and ceiling.  I would recommend this place to anyone looking for great food and friendly service."}
{"text":"I am always searching for good chicken fried steak. This is the best I have ever had! It's so big it might give you a heart attack. Make room for the peach cobbler! It's soooooo good! I can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"Had an early dinner with my family today. The food was great; atmosphere was family friendly; service was superb. The floor manager visiting the customers was very customer focused. He did a great job of engaging with our entire table including giving us challenging riddles to solve. We will definitely come here again when we are in town."}
{"text":"I was so excited to try this chicken fried steak - Not impressed at all - it was so soggy (like it had been pre-made and sitting out) it was beyond bland and I had to add so much salt/pepper to the gravy for any flavor.....I also sensed an \"off flavor\", kind of sweet, that didn't belong with CFS - only to get home to raging food poisoning within the hour.......Also, the catfish was also bland and flavorless. Place is so crowded, loud and a bit dingy.....Only reason it got 2 stars was because the service was nice and staff was very friendly."}
{"text":"I'll be short, and just get to the point on this one:

The only reason I managed to give this place 2 stars was because they definitely gave you good sized portions for the price.  However, a large portion of nasty, is still just nasty, regardless of how much they give you.  The Chicken Fried Steak (their pride and joy) was bland and the only flavor was grease.  I don't mean the typical \"its a fried dish\" grease flavor, no i mean it tasted like after they pulled it out of the fryer they dipped it in the oil vat.  The gravy was nondescript and flavorless.    Side options were nothing special, they seem to rave about the cole slaw, but it is not my cup of tea, so I passed.  This place seems like the type of establishment that if you are a regular then you get stellar service, if you are not, then oh well to you.  Funny, because how do people get to be a new regular if you aren't giving decent service to the new guest.

To sum it up, people swear by this place. I however, have sworn off this place.  I don't get it, I left feeling ripped off and revolted that I even ate that junk (now don't get me wrong, I enjoy a good chicken fried steak, this just was not it for sure!)"}
{"text":"I strongly prefer the chicken fried chicken! It's juicy and flavorful, and is a larger portion (not that you can finish either!!). Love this place!"}
{"text":"Amazing chicken fried chicken and chicken fried steak, the plates could feed an entire family! I've been going here with my entire family since I was little, an amazing restaurant to say the least. Locally owned and run, which always means good service. HIt this place up if you're hungry and looking for some good country-western home cookin'."}
{"text":"Really great place.  I love hole in wall places where the decor reflects the owners collecting compulsion.  Had the chicken fried since that was the rec in the reviews.  I was really good and large.  Only ate about a third of it."}
{"text":"Most recent visit here was for lunch, I need to eat here more often.  My buddy had the chicken fried steak and I had a pulled pork sandwich with cole slaw.  The pulled pork was juicy, smoky and very tasty with the fried onion straws. As for the CFS, I tried a bite and that's all I got as it quickly vanished from my compadres plate. Lunch service time was excellent and the food was great. And to top it off the prices were very good for lunch specials."}
{"text":"The chicken fried steak was really good! They give you free hot biscuits for the table too. Only took a star off because the service was a bit slow, but the food made up for it!"}
{"text":"Their chicken fried steak is enormous. It is literally hanging off the sides of the oval plate. My problem is that there is just a stripe of meat in between two thick coatings of breading. On its own, it's very bland; but with the gravy and variety of condiments on the table it comes to life. I suppose it's a matter of taste; but I would prefer the option of a traditional, smaller, thicker, piece of meat with the same breading and a little seasoning. The mashed potatoes are real and tasty as is the corn. The biscuit is... OK. Seating is cramped and most seats are occupied. Wait staff is personable. 
They do a good business. I left full; but still craving a traditional chicken fried steak."}
{"text":"Let me start by saying this wasn't our first choice. We were on our way over to The Vig (which was RIGHT next door) but had to rethink our choice considering we had our in-laws who can eat like hippos. The bro-in-law wanted meat. \"Meat. I need MEAT!\" was all he said when I asked him what he wanted. Fine, i'll find meat...So enters this restaurant. Really cute, dive-ish restaurant with an awfully small parking lot and equally small interior space. It's the type of joint that you would find in a cute, cozy small town where regulars flock to. 

We were seated immediately and was greeted by our sweet and friendly waitress. She was attentive and quick, even though she was servicing quite a few other tables. 

The food was good; very comforting and filling but nothing special. Mr and I shared the Rib Eye and the in-laws got the NY steak, each. We added their cup of chili, side of mashed potatoes with house gravy, salad, and potato wedges. They also have whole jalepenos for $.10, which we got 5 of. All in all, it was a good meal but definitely not a Mastro's or Fleming's. If you want a nice, normal dinner with no frou-frou, this is the place!"}
{"text":"THey have the best chicken fried steak that I have ever had!!! There daily specials are amazing as well!!"}
{"text":"My old man always said if you wanted to get rich you'd buy a Texan for what he was worth and sell him for what he thought he was worth. That about summarizes my feelings about TexAZ Grill. This is the most overrated place I've been to in a while. 

I'd never been to TexAZ before today because I always seem to crave chicken fried steak for breakfast, and the place doesn't open until 11:00 a.m. Well, today I was craving chicken fried steak for lunch, so I thought I'd try out TexAZ out. 

The size of the chicken fried steak is enormous, there's no denying that; but that's where the goodness ends. Sometimes quantity has a quality all its own, but not here. Let's face it: chicken fried steak is a vehicle for gravy. Even though the TexAZ steak was big enough to feed four hungry lumberjacks, they really skimped on the gravy. Even worse, both the gravy and the steak were bland, without a hint of identifiable spice. I kept eying the numerous condiments on the table while wondering if maybe adding them to the meal would make it easier to eat. The sides that accompanied the meal let me down too. The biscuit is more like a roll, and didn't flake as a biscuit should; the corn seemed like it might have come right out of a can; and I don't remember much about my mashed potatoes. 

In summary: \"Meh. I've experienced better.\" In fact, I enjoy the chicken fried steak at the JB's on 19th Ave. and Missouri more than the one here. I won't be returning."}
{"text":"TexAZ Grill is a low key hidden gem in Phoenix.  It's location is modest, its decor is eccentric, very Texan inspired, and the size of the restaurant is fairly small.  The portions however are not so small.  I went for Brunch and of course I had to try the chicken fried steak everyone raves about. I was not disappointed in the CFS, just as the man other yelpers state, it is Indeed very good. Not made of the usual ground beef type of meat, it was more of an actual deep fried thinly pound steak.  What also came as a surprise, was how much I enjoyed the side dishes. The gravy was amazing, as were the biscuits and if your thirsty, may I suggest the Turlingua Sunrise. I cannot wait to come back and try a big juicy steak. 
God bless Texas!"}
{"text":"I've been to Texaz grill a few times for their deadly, but pretty darn good chicken fried steak. This past Saturday, I went to grab a bite while my babies got groomed. 

I sat down at the bar next to a group of bar flies that seemed to be regulars. The conversation was in full swing about politics, which they tried to drag me into but I politely declined and said \"I don't discuss politics while trying to digest food.\"

I ordered one of the specials which was a smoked hot link drenched in bbq sauce on a po-boy bun. It was served with coleslaw, but I ordered some Texaz fries with it. The hot link was dry and almost jerky-esque, possibly due to the smoking process, or maybe the links were just old. They were still tasty, and being a girl that is used to smoked meats around the house, I kind of enjoyed eating the semi-dry little discs. I tossed aside the top half of the po boy bun, and just ate the meat with the sauce soaked bottom half of the bun. The sauce was dark, with a smoky sweet flavor. The coleslaw was creamy and the cabbage was finely chopped. The Texaz potatos are chunks of seasoned, and fried potatos. I only ate about 3 or 4 before I was stuffed. 

As is always the case with Texaz Grill, I wasn't overly delighted, but I wasn't overly disappointed. Texaz Grill is a dive that happens to serve pretty good food! It's nothing fancy, it's nothing sophisticated, but if you're in the mood for meat, or chicken fried steak, head there."}
{"text":"After a long hard work week, my girlfriend and I wanted to go out and get some good comfort food.  She wanted to go to Lo Lo's and as you can see based off my previous review of that place, I really wasn't too excited.  I found this place on yelp and convinced my girlfriend to come here.  Oh boy, I'm glad we did.  We heard all the good reviews of the Chicken fried steak and we had to give it a try.  We ordered Fried Okra as a appetizer and I got the large chicken fried steak and she got the smothered pork chop.  Everything was a hit!  The gravy was amazing and the food was great!  The place was pretty packed for a Friday night, the service was great and everything was on point."}
{"text":"Had lunch here this week... We had  1 chicken fried chicken and 1 chicken fried steak... Both delicious and served promptly with a smile... This is one of my favorite restaurants and I don't mind the 40 minute drive from the west valley... A real Phoenix Classic !"}
{"text":"Simply the best chicken fried steak I've ever had. Awesome for a good price."}
{"text":"This place has the best smoked prime rib! But the whole mashed potatoes and their gravy topped everything for me. It's not much to look at but the food is fantastic. The staff is great too..."}
{"text":"Wow. I'm tempted to hide in the booth and spend the night so I can wake up and eat another chicken fried steak for breakfast . Nancy took great care of me and kept my ice tea filled even with my post airplane ride thirst. The chicken fried steak was incredible. Very good mashed potatoes though I didn't eat much of them as I was trying to get all that chicken fried goodness down. I will make this place a regular stop when business brings me to Phoenix!"}
{"text":"Going to boost them up because the \"Eggs Bubba\" was spot-on (with some added salt and pepper).  Biscuits (basic), chicken fried steak (super tender), sunny side up eggs, and sausage gravy, all coming together into an indulgent brunch dish.

The large hunks of fried potatoes (\"Texas Fries\") were cooked through, and had a nice \"real\" potato flavor to them.  Some salt and pepper plus ketchup finished them nicely.

The pecan pie is very sweet and chewy, and the pecans are candied beautifully.  Not the biggest fan of the crust (it could be more buttery and crumbly) but overall it was very good.

The place looked clean to me, and I appreciate being able to sit at a booth during a time when they weren't super busy.  My water was never empty for too long, and the waitress did a good job.  While I'm not a fan of the decor, I do appreciate how all the flags and caps on the walls and ceiling dampen the noise level.

After being disappointed at the diners around here, I'll be back for their REAL (not frozen and re-heated) chicken fried steak/chicken and their REAL (not instant or canned)!sausage gravy."}
{"text":"took my parents there last nite  for dinner  and its the first time they experienced a MULLIGAN cut   prime rib   they could not beleive the size of the cut of meat   cooked perfect smoked lightley and the sides and deserts were  excellent  will always bring out of towners  here    service is the best"}
{"text":"Can't believe it took us this long to try this place! Friends had eaten here and loved it. Husband and I decided to try it out and stopped in for Sunday dinner. The place has a relaxed, homey comforting feel. We both had the smoked prime rib. Came with small dinner salads which were cold and had chopped olives (like a tapenade) on them making for a tasty addition. The smoked prime rib was amazing. The flavor was incredible! Overall really enjoyed the meal and had great service...could easily become a new favorite spot for us."}
{"text":"The TEXAZ Grill so far my best place and my favorite to get the biggest chicken fried steak I've ever eaten So light and crispy breading is to die for, you must get it with the Mass potatoes so yummy!!!! Like they said it's always bigger in Texas.  They do also have other amazing favorites too but if you are a chicken fried steak fan then you have to come down and try it out.  They have great customer service, great server they are so nice and sweet.  The inside is very busy but it has a lot of history on the wall you always find something new on the wall I haven't seen the last time you were there. So if you ever get a chance to stop in and get yourself a big ass chicken fried steak.  Mmm mm good."}
{"text":"My  ex-hubby and I used to frequent this place in 1991 when it was called The Lone Star. It was awesome then...and it's still just as awesome!!!
I moved away for 20 years and when my ex-mother-in-law came into town we decided to give Texaz Grill a try, not even thinking that it was the same place. 

Boy! Were we pleasantly surprised!!

Nothing has changed! Not the decorations, not the menu, not the friendly staff, not the quality of the food...NOTHING!!! Ok. I'm lying. There was a different picture on the back of the ladies room door.

We all ordered the Ribeye with the house salad/house dressing, homemade mashed potatoes and cream gravy. I've dreamt about those mashed potatoes!! The steaks were perfect! Juicy, tender, flavorful, cooked to order. Chain steakhouses have NOTHING on this place!

We finished our meal with the homemade bread pudding with whiskey sauce. Trust me, you've never had bread pudding so good! Full of cinnamon, raisins, and pecans with the most delightful whiskey sauce.

If you live in Phoenix or are just passing through stop in at The Texaz Grill! You won't regret it!"}
{"text":"this place was awful service was bad and steaks were tough and tatseless and the waitress sharon did not even offer us dessert"}
{"text":"Having lived in Texas for years, we tried this last night now that we live in AZ, and I'm pregnant and wanted smoked red meat. Got the smoked brisket sandwich with texaz fries and hubs got chicken fried steak & fries, kids got chicken fingers & grilled cheese. We finished off with the bread pudding. The brisket had a good flavor, wish it had more smoke ring and more sauce, but that's just a preference. Hubs chicken fried steak was amazing. We both tried our daughters mashed potatoes & wished we got those! The texaz fries were also great, but the mashed were amazing. And the chicken tenders were real chicken, hand dipped & fried. Definitely good breeding a and biscuits, totally homemade. For anyone wanting Texas comfort food, I would recommend it. The service was wonderful also. Wish the hats weren't dusty, Rhys my only gripe. Dusty hats hanging over my food doesn't say yum. But, sit in the middle of the restaurant and it won't bother you."}
{"text":"WOW, if you are hungry this is the place to come, excellent service as well as food, the chicken fried steak dinner will feed two very easily... Everything is texas size !!!"}
{"text":"Got a chance to check out Texaz grill finally. Wifey has been beggin me to go here forever and I finally caved. Not sure why, I friggin love chicken fried steak. I perused the menu, but already knew I was going for the go-to dish. we also started with an order of the fried okra. Wifey got the special, which was chicken and dumplings. Little man ordered a cheeseburger. The okra was awesome! tender, perfectly seasoned and just the way fried okra should be. My chicken fried steak was HUGE, like the size of my face. Now bigger isn't always better. The steak was just okay. Somehow with all the gravy, it ws pretty bland. The steak part tasted more like liver and the breading was a bit doughy. I wasn't blown away by my meal but it doesn't matter, it was still a good experience. the service was great, prices cheap and we didn't have to drive very far. Will I go back? probably not, but definitely glad we finally checked it out."}
{"text":"So I'm a az transplant here in 1996 from Texas and I love it here but I'm still a Texan at heart... born and raised Houston Texas.

 I had a hankering for a real chicken fried steak and lo and behold here I am. I am impressed by a menu that's not too large with multiple items. The menu is smaller but it has all the staples you're want. 

I got the CFS and it was huge and tasteful. I had the coleslaw which wasn't too wet and I had the steak fries otstead of mashed...wow o didn't want to leave. Good food! 

Parking through leaves a lot to be desired... you have to do a three point turn about 6 times to fit it in a spot... small lot and small spots. You can try to come in off 7th street but that parking is directional so you need to be driving west. I parked off the Bethany home entrance.

However the place ambiance is definitely pretty intense on the decor. :-)

Ok so it's now 2018 and OMG the place is awesome still... always something new and amazing on the menu especially the daily features. I wish I didn't move so far away... however I still make it a time to visit and eat and enjoy... I think it's an amazing place to eat and relax without anyone pushing you out the door to get table and they do have both tables and booth and a bar to sit at and yes the have a nice hidden parking area lol anyway I upgrade to 5 stars"}
{"text":"First time here and received the best customer service from our waitress!  She was so sweet and nice.  And the food was delicious and reasonably priced.  Portions were pretty decent and we even had some leftover food to take home.  The décor is definitely something else... business cards on the ceiling, hats, posters, vintage signs, etc.  It's actually really cool.  The only negative I have about this joint is the parking.  It's some tight parking out there but it's manageable.  I'd come back again... the rib eye I ordered was on point!"}
{"text":"Every time we visit Phoenix, we make a point to stop here. The drinks are an incredible value. Less then 6 bucks for a jack and dirt. The steaks are delicious! My husband loves their chicken fried steak with gravy on the side. I eat his gravy and usually a chicken kabob or sometimes a special. I also love the steak minus the lemon butter. My favorite thing is that it comes with a salad and potato. Seriously? We save so much money left over that we have dessert! The pecan pie is sooooo!!!!! Good! I live in CA but everyone we come to we stop here at least 4 times."}
{"text":"Very nice and accommodating, bottles of wine at great prices.. Food was good and very large, I will be coming back."}
{"text":"Known for it's fabulous ribeye steaks, I have to say we have found our favorite place for Catfish, it is just delicious, and what a serving, Two big catfish fillets, served with mashed potatoes and gravy or steak fries, all for$12.00, you just cant beat it.

The Catfish is always fresh  and  Fabulous, the crisp batter is like no other, and the fish is flakey and YUM YUM!!!!!. 
The chichen fried steak, is no joke, enough for two and just AWESOME,tender and tastey served with mashed potatoes/gravy and homemade biscuits, the kind of stuff that sticks to your ribs, you will not go home hungery, that is for sure.
TEXAZ is a small place but it is cozy, parking can be a bear, but the food is worth it. Oh yeah, almost forgot , they do have a lovely pecan pie served a la mode if you like, DELICIOUS!"}
{"text":"My family has been going her for seems like over 20 years. Their food has been good with only a few times I was not pleased, but considering we have been there 100's of times, it is not a big deal. I think most of their meny is great, and have enjoyed just about everything on it, although their steaks could use a little more seasoning.  If you are prefer a \"pure\" steak- just a great cut of beef cooked with little to no seasoning, then this steak is for you. Don't mistake me- I am not saying anything negative about their steaks, just acknowledging that some people prefer a \"pure\" steak, and others like myself prefer a nicely seasoned steak- it's all personal preference, and neither way is wrong."}
{"text":"Amazing. Their chicken fried chicken, brisket sandwiches, salads and mashed potatoes are DELICIOUS. We absolutely love this place! The service is phenomenal, the portion sizes are great and the decor is awesome. We'll be coming here for many years guaranteed!"}
{"text":"Best chicken fried steak in town. The Tuesday special ham steak is fantastic too. Parking is not good but the food is worth it."}
{"text":"To be fair, this review is based only on the CFS, as we both had it. The best way to describe it is \"Quantity over Quality. It is way, way WAY overrated.  We saw the chicken fried steak review in the Arizona Republic's annual Roundup of the best in Arizona and went to try it out. The CFS is itself pretty ordinary, but then, how good can CFS be? Is a pretty simple dish made from a cheap cut of meat. The accompanying mashed potatoes were just okay. I must say that the coleslaw is the best I've ever had. 

The portions are over the top gigantic. There is no way a normal person can eat this meal: for $14 you get two absolutely enormous pieces of meat covered in breading and smothered in cream gravy. As a result, there was a lot of waste-we paid attention, and didn't see a single person come close to finishing their meal. Of course, a lot of people then take it home, but warmed up chicken fried steak? Really? The waitress agreed that they serve way too much food-she said they often suggest to management just serving one piece of meat, But for some reason they don't, except for lunch. I guess they prefer to make their contribution to America's obesity problem. 
 
We arrived 6PM  Friday night and had a short, 10 minute wait. They only take reservations for 6 or more."}
{"text":"Don't get Texa'z' food in Phoenix.  It wasn't very good.  The meat was a very small portion (not exactly following the saying of everything is bigger in Texas).  The side dishes were not very good, but the desert was pretty good.

Did I mess up and not get the chicken fried steak which this restaurant is known for?  My health had the best of me when considering it was a fried dish, so I avoided it.  But then I opted for a very lean slab of beef which isn't exactly the healthiest either.

I do have to commend them in making Shiner Bock their house beer.  Luckily it wasn't the Lone Star.  The Shiner Bock Black was pretty good."}
{"text":"i was recommended to this place by a friend of mine who said he hadn't been here in awhile but thought it was great last time he was there. i really wish i didn't listen to him.

when my girlfriend i entered the building the first sign of this place sucking was probably the empty dining room, but it was around 8:30 so that i can understand. what i cannot understand and what was such a disappointment, was the food. 

I ordered the rib-eye which on the menu said it was \"Jim's special\", which wasn't so special at all but ill get into that in a minute, my girlfriend ordered the shrimp cocktail as an appetizer and  the brisket sand which as her entree. now, for 6 bucks i expect more than 4 tiny shrimp, but it was good so that still gets my OK.

 what doesn't get my OK was the steak. my rib-eye, which was like 18 bucks, a reasonable price for a reasonable sized steak, was probably smaller than a hamburger patty and was well done when i ordered it medium. the mashed potatoes as my side i ordered double of which i wish i didn't, because it was more like double gravy, single mashed potatoes. the gravy itself tasted like it was pure lard, and i was unable to even eat it because it was just so heavy. I'm a bigger guy, i like fattening food, but that was just gross to me. my girlfriends food wasn't that much better. 

when the bill came around, it was 48 bucks, which is what i left with no tip because the service was equally terrible, she was rude and acted like she wanted us gone. i have NEVER not left a tip. 

i know this place has a great reputation, and that's what got me in there, but when i left i was honestly impressed by how bad that was. i almost want to call my friend that suggested this place to me and tell him he owes me 50 bucks. 

not worth it, never coming back here again."}
{"text":"We went here last Saturday.  Good decor, pretty good service, food needs some work.

We were greeted when we arrived and told how long the wait was.  Then, after the expected wait were shown to our table.  So far so good.

We ordered our dinners, two of which included Salad.  The greens for the salad looked they came out of a bag and definitely were not fresh.  Kind of that slimy one week old feeling ... We both had the house dressing.  Didn't like it.

My wife had the chicken, I had the Lin Su (a steak with two shrimp on top, and our son had the BBQ.  My son liked the BBQ.  My wife and I didn't care for ours.  Perhaps we were so turned off by the salad that it colored our perception of the meal.  I'm not sure.  We might try it again.  Hopefully the salad is an anomaly."}
{"text":"Legendary chicken fried steak and awesome mashed potatoes and gravy. Whatever distance you may be from this little piece of heaven, get in the car and go. I would recommend training for the moment for at least a couple weeks because your food capacity limits will be tested. Best I've had in a VERY long time. Could not recommend more highly."}
{"text":"Food was ok but not horrible, but not that great as everyone makes it out to be!. It's pretty much your average restaurant so I don't understand the hype to much.. and over pricedddddddd!!!!!"}
{"text":"BEST PRIME RIB..  but the side dishes lack.  You wont leave hungry however.  The biscuits with honey are the bomb!!!    Other great items are the Ribeye steak and of course the chicken fried steak......."}
{"text":"A great grill with incredible food at very reasonable prices. The Pablo battered shrimp are great! The smoked prime rib is incredible. Would recommend anyone passing through Phoenix be sure and stop here!"}
{"text":"The Chicken Fried Steak is to die for - best ever.  And, chopped green olives in the house salad - so simple, so good.  Come back for the smoked prime rib."}
{"text":"My co-worker took me to eat here let's just say I ordered the Chicken Fried Chicken and inhaled it....damn it was good!! Listen you're  are not coming here to order the salad and watch your calories so get over it and throw down on some good food! Plus it's easy on the pockets and you will for sure need a nap afterwards. Look forward to coming back to try more stuff off the menu!"}
{"text":"I stopped by here with a friend after a meeting in the area.  He is a native and never eaten here before.  We ordered their best dish.  The chicken fried steak.  It was really really good.  I have had CFS all over the country and this place serves some of the best.  It came with white gravy, mashed potatoes and corn.  The CFS was cooked to perfection and crispy.  You looking for a good CFS try this place.  They are cooked fresh."}
{"text":"Still not feeling well after eating at this restaurant. I ordered the ribeye steak. It arrived swimming in grease, having clearly been pan fried, too long. The flavor of the meat tasted like meat that sat in the fridge too long. My husband, typically a hearty eater, didn't even eat a quarter of his meal. It's really too bad, because the staff here seem nice. It isn't a place we would choose again."}
{"text":"YUM!  A definite thumbs up and will be back !  :) Very friendly and attentive staff! We will definitely be back. Chicken fried steak huge cook well, smashed skins on taters, yum.  A definite recommend."}
{"text":"I've been going to TexAZ Grill for the best part of 20 years. I really used to enjoy it - had not been there for many years and just went back last week. Most everyone at the table wasn't that happy with the food - the ribs that someone had were particularly lackluster. I ordered one of the early bird specials, a small NY with a cheese enchilada and thought it was pretty good - but at $9.50 my expectations were not real high. The service was just OK _ I had to get up to ask someone for bread plates, as we didn't have any. The biscuits (which used to be awesome) were kind of cold and hard. I'd go back one more time for sure, because my favorite is their Chicken Fried Chicken, but as I didn't order that, I would have to try it one more time before I crossed this place off of my list...it really did used to be great food with great service, but this last time, it really was just decent food with acceptable service."}
{"text":"My Dad and my brothers are big steak eaters. Me? Not so much. So when we came here a few weeks back I hoped the reviews lived up to their hype. Not at all. First, it was a Saturday night at 7 p.m and the place was nearly empty.

My New York strip steak was bland. The fried potatoes are huge, plain and flavorless - no seasoning whatsoever. Everyone else thought their prime rib and steaks were boring and average. The martinis? Microscopic. Hanny's style. I couldn't decide which were smaller. Hanny's or Texaz?

I think the three stars I'm giving is really generous, but the atmosphere here rocks (you find something new on the wall every time) and our server had an awesome attitude and handled our 7 person party professionally. I may or may not be back."}
{"text":"Some good traditional home cooking. The Chicken Fried Steak is a must try. The Prime Rib smoked over Pecan wood, OMG that was a treat. The gravy here is amazing and the Pecan Pie is from heaven. No matter how full I get with dinner I still order the pie and it manages to disappear. Thank God I don't live around here cuz it would not be good for my health."}
{"text":"I wanted to grab something to eat on my way home from work . I stopped by TEXAZ grill . I was slobs so I sat at the bar . I had the rib eye. It was cooked to perfection . The taste was amazing . Very tender and juicy. My mashed potatoes and gravy were yummy !  So creamy and the gravy was thick and had lots of flavor . Tammy at the car is always so nice and attentive .   Can't wait to go back"}
{"text":"Great food, sweet staff, great times! 

Came here on a Monday night, tired and in search of a good meal. Delivered.

Ordered their speciality, chicken fried steak and it met plus exceeded the hype. Huge portion and extremely flavorful! Add a dose of southern hospitality and you have the perfect weeknight meal.

Highly recommend this place, you will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"We went there last night and I'm thinking other reviews must be from their regulars. It was nothing like other reviews described. Our waitress seemed to have an instant dislike to us. When I asked for the honey mustard dressing she said \"There's no honey in it, it's our house vinaigrette.\" I ordered it and it was totally wilted. I like to always let my husband sample my food and when she saw me give it to him she said \"You don't like it!\". My steak was bland and had to be sent back because it was underdone. Our friend is a vegetarian and asked if they could make her a grilled cheese sandwich, which they declined. She's 17 and then asked for a kid's menu to see if there were kid friendly dishes and was told it was for 12 and under and wasn't even allowed to see what other choices there were. The icing on the cake was to hear the waitress mock vegetarians to her regular customers by us. She said you don't want cheese on your salad then I will hold that. Btw, she's a vegetarian not vegan. We kept saying she just doesn't eat meat, but eats dairy. Then she asked if she wanted her to hold the olives and tomatoes. Maybe she didn't know what a vegetarian is. I asked if we could order her a cheeseburger and just hold the patty and she said \"Why would you want to do that?\"."}
{"text":"I've lived in the valley off and on since 1990, and have eaten here without exaggeration at least 100 times.  This is true Texas to the bone!  I've pretty much had everything on the menu, and have never had anything I didn't like.  The Smoked Prime Rib is Stellar as are The Mashed Potatoes.  The Chicken Fried Steak and Chicken as well as the Catfish are the real deal.  They don't heavily season their food out of the kitchen.  Last time I checked that's what the salt and pepper on the table is for!  I personally like the Chili they serve as well, reminds me of the Classic Texas Brick Chili my Mom made when I was a kid.  The Atmosphere, decor is true Central Texas. You have to have lived there or visit a lot to truly appreciate The True Texas vibe of this place.  I'm truly at home here and will keep on coming back.  Steve and the gang have a great long standing tradition here. Anytime I have family or friends from Texas in town visiting I always bring them here, and they always leave with a smile on their faces just like I do... Very refreshing to have such a down home, feel good vibe Restaurant such as this in The Valley of The Sun."}
{"text":"Huge, tasty portions for very reasonable prices! Service 4/5; Food 4/5.

Food: I got the brisket sandwich, and my husband got the chicken fried steak. Massive, massive portions - you could easily get two meals out of each serving. The sandwich was nice and juicy, and I appreciated that the brisket was sliced instead of chopped. There was enough sauce & coleslaw to go with, too, so I didn't have to ask for more! My husband's steak was pretty good, but a little bit dry and chewy. I don't know whether he got a tougher cut, or whether that's standard here.

Service: Our waitress was nice, and patient about answering all our questions. Everything came out in a timely manner, and we were happy with the way we were treated. Nothing stellar, but perfectly reasonable. Other staff seemed friendly, too.

Other points of interest: The decor was really interesting and made for a good conversation piece, and we liked how unique the restaurant was. It definitely has its own culture. We'll probably be back sometime!"}
{"text":"Go here - the food is really good. I had chicken fried steak + house salad for lunch today and it was as good a meal as I've had in a long time. You may need to hit the gym afterward, but worth it."}
{"text":"We hadn't been to Texaz in about ten years, so we thought it would be fun to take the kids last weekend. It's still crowded and with the animals, posters, newspaper articles on the walls and hundreds of ballcaps hanging from the ceiling, the atmosphere at Texaz is a genuine version of the type of place that chain restaurants pay designers big money to create. For kids, its a cornucopia of sights and sounds to look at which accounts for the two stars I'm giving it.

However, it doesn't get any more stars because the food has really gone downhill. Naturally my wife and I ordered the meal that this restaurant is famous for - chicken-fried steak with mashed potatoes and gravy and as I said, we hadn't been there in about ten years, but there is no way the food used to be this bland. Unfortunately, this was one of the most boring chicken-fried steaks I have ever had. The breading had no flavor and the gravy didn't add any either. I like good chicken fried steak, but this wasn't it. In fact, I'd be embarrassed to bring anyone from Texas to this place.

Sorry Texaz, I know you're a Central Phoenix institution, but you're riding on past glory."}
{"text":"You only need to know three words walking into TEXAZ Grill: chicken fried steak. It's a huge monster, with a crispy double dipped batter layer encasing a beautiful tenderized steak, smothered with a beautiful white gravy. Without a doubt TEXAZ Grill has the best chicken fried steak in the Phoenix area, perhaps even Arizona!

Portions are huge too! The dinner portion actually gives you two steaks while the lunch portion gives you one. The coleslaw and mashed potatoes on the side were huge as well.

The restaurant is a bit small and the parking lot a bit smaller, but the interior is definitely cozy and the staff is very friendly. It really makes the meal worth it on top of the kick*** CFS. You NEED to try this out!"}
{"text":"Always awesome! Great service & atmosphere. Been here lots of times. One of the best fried chicken dinners in Phoenix (totally overlooked). Of course there's the smoked Prime Rib and the chicken fried steak, which are both terrific. For dessert, let me recommend the bread pudding or the calas with a cup of coffee. I just love this place."}
{"text":"The food is good, that's already been expressed. The service is amazing!!!! From the greeting, to bringing constant refills, to pleasing the children (nephew).  It's like going to a Deep South restaurant where the staff goes out of their way to make sure you're comfortable. It sounds cheesy, but I'll admit I was hesitant to go in this restaurant because it doesn't look friendly from the outside. So I guess my vibe reader was wrong. Oh- and great lemonade!"}
{"text":"I was in the mood for steak, while in Phoenix on vacation. After reading the reviews on Yelp, we decided to try Texaz. It is a local restaurant, which is appealing to me. We both had the smoked prime rib. The meat was cooked to perfection and was very flavorful. The mashed potatoes with creamy gravy were, likewise, excellent. Portions were big. The service was great. The only downside was that parking was a little scarce when we were there, but please don't let that deter you. I'll definitely want to remember this restaurant the next time I visit Phoenix."}
{"text":"I have gone to Texaz Grill since they opened 35 years ago and they serve the best chicken fried steak anywhere.  The portion is so large even the Little Tex we always split the large and ask for a side of mashed potatoes. And the mac & cheese is the bomb for $6.00 is a meal in itself yum!"}
{"text":"My husband has been hunting for a place where he could get chicken that he liked for years. He is crazy about the Chicken Fried Chicken here.  The gravy is wonderful, not pasty and paired with your choice of mashed potatoes or their own version of fries.  He loves the mashed potatoes.  I don't care for the fries. They're good tasting chunks of potato but don't resemble fries AT ALL.  Their burger is decent but the I don't like their club sandwiches.  They used good ingredients but instead of the traditional bread in layers its all just on a french roll bun.  Last time I got the Chicken Fried Chicken sandwich and enjoyed it.  Again the burger bun its on is sufficient but for a great piece of chicken like that better buns would help.  I loved the Bread Pudding in Whiskey Sauce for dessert.  We've always gotten the same waitress and have loved her.  She's pleasant, helpful and has a great attitude."}
{"text":"Coworker recommended this place to me. Turned out to be a very rare homerun here in Phoenix. Most restaurants inevitably disappoint, but this place was mega solid.

Service is really great. Nancy was our server and she is a true pro. Very nice change of pace to have an attentive and efficient waitress. This place runs like clockwork. 

Food was outstanding, and came out at just the right pace.

I love chicken fried steak, but I rarely order it because it never stacks up to the old Stroud's in Kansas City. Texaz does a very solid CFS. Giant, dinosaur sized piece of meat, cooked perfectly, just slightly under-seasoned, but overall awesome. I ate the entire thing, and I'm well under 200lbs. Coleslaw was near perfect, too.

My girlfriend had their ribeye. Cooked as ordered, very tasty. Her mashed potatoes were spot on. She was happy, and our dogs loved the connective tissue we brought home. 

Beer list is a little thin, but that's not why you would come here. Decor is cool; definitely reminds me of a lot of the hole-in-the-wall places I've eaten at in mid-sized Midwest cities. 

Pricing is good, but parking is shit. It's always busy for a reason, though. We came around 8p on a Tuesday, so luckily there was some parking and no waiting. If you come here during happy hour, best of luck! 

Highly recommended."}
{"text":"The anti-immigrant bumper sticker about abducting \"illegal[s] was enough to ruin a meal.  Sending the steak back that came out raw didn't help."}
{"text":"Terrible salad as lettuce was wilted a bit.  Steak was so filled with marbleing that it was ineatable.  The cup of water was good."}
{"text":"You will be hard-pressed to find better value in a steakhouse than this place.  We had the smoked prime rib, and it was outstanding - smoky but not overpowering, tender, juicy, and HUGE.  We also had their famous chicken fried steak, and it was tender, flavorful, and the gravy was perfect.  And it was also huge.  People complaining about the price need to get out more, because you will not find better prices than these for anywhere near the quality or quantity.  Go early if you want the prime rib; we got there before 5:30 on a Thursday and they were nearly out.  They have happy hour on weeknights with half-price drinks, I had 2 glasses of  Mondavi red wine for a grand total of 4 measly bucks to wash down the prime rib with.  A real treat; we lived in Texas for years and this place could easily compete with the better steakhouses there."}
{"text":"Chicken Fried Steak!! WOW!! 

A huge portion, pounded perfectly tender, battered and deep fried to a flaky crust - just delicious! The Bread pudding with whiskey sauce was awesome as well. 
Staff was friendly and service was quick to the table. This place is an absolute old school phoenix gem.

We will be back to try the pork chops and steaks!!

FYI - parking can be tough - plenty of spots around back of building."}
{"text":"My wife and I stopped in last night for the Tuesday night special of beef back ribs. It had been maybe fifteen years since we had last been here, and was both looking forward to some good ribs. However last night the ribs where charred way to black outside. Literally charcoal black. We both had beef ribs, but at least two of the five on each plate where not eatable.   
Think forgotten under the broiler for way too long and then topped with lukewarm bbq sauce. 
I ordered steak fries and received quartered potatoes that where also hard and dry and bland.
Maybe I'll try back in another fifteen years."}
{"text":"We drove a little out of our way to visit Texaz Grill, but it was more than worth it. We both had the pecan smoked prime rib, which was heavenly.  Perfect rosy center, almost fork-tender, and the flavor--the best prime rib we ever had. Would like to sample other menu items when we return, but it'll be hard to resist the pr. We would like to have seen a cooked veggie on the plate. The mashed taters were great; the salad was OK. Our waitress was super nice and helpful. When my husband asked the best way to heat up his copious leftover meat, she suggested warming it is some of the au jus--then went to the kitchen and brought back  a little container of it. What a doll! I agree with others that you almost have to helicopter into the the parking lot. Next time we might look elsewhere and walk a little. Notwithstanding, I won't budge on my five stars for the food."}
{"text":"Great place! Just a hole in the wall with great food. Country Fried Steak was the best. My wife loved the catfish. We will be back"}
{"text":"Went back recently, and it was just as good, if not better than I remembered.  I was too long in Las Vegas.  Price, portions and service are all excellent.  I just wish I lived closer."}
{"text":"Not many menu choices but we both ordered the chicken fried steak & could have shared one plate. We both had half our plates left over. That would have been nice to know ahead of time. The bread they serve before dinner is ok; it kept the kids occupied until the food came. The food we ordered was ok but I don't think we will be back. Slow waiter service as well."}
{"text":"We just left Texaz, and I just had a write a review because the experience was so amazing!  We were with a big party of 13 people ranging in ages from 3 to 40.  The owner came by and played trivia with all of the kids at the table and gave out prizes for the right answers. How often does something like that happen?  

Service - Our service was top notch!  We each ordered several courses and our server was always on top of drink refills, each order was correct, and we had to ask for nothing as she anticipated what each of us would need.  She was quiet but very thoughtful.

Food - Giant - Texas size portions, great tasting and very reasonably priced, considering our group was mostly teenagers what more could you ask for?  The chicken fried steak is amazing!!!

Décor/ambience - lots and lots of things on the wall and an infinite amount of Texas kitsch.

I would recommend Texaz for lunch or dinner any day of the week.  It was a great experience and the food was outstanding!"}
{"text":"This place is known for their chicken fried steak.  And they certainly do it right.  They have a billboard that is a running tally of how many servings of chicken fried steak they have served....now that's confidence in your product!  But if you feel like something else, they have an amazing prime rib (you have to get there early though....they only make a certain amount of prime rib each night and when they run out, they run out).  If you want something a little smaller---and that's not saying much, since their portions are huge, get the brisket sandwich, ask for the bbq sauce on the side, and ask for a side of au ju.  You won't regret it.  It's amazing!!  

Don't expect some fancy schmancy steakhouse--but go hungry and you won't regret your decision to go there!"}
{"text":"Wasn't crazy about this place. We started with fried okra & beer battered shrimp and for our main course we had the chicken fried steak, chicken fried chicken and brisket sandwich. From the kids menu, we ordered  smoked prime rib. And for dessert we ordered the peach cobbler.

For starters, the biscuits and rolls we got didn't taste fresh, in fact, they tasted like they'd been warmed up in a microwave. Already a terrible start. But it did get better with our apps. The fried okra was very good, the okra was ripe, not at all bitter. The beer battered shrimp was also very good, light batter, fresh shrimp, our meal was looking better.

Then dinner came, the chicken fried chicken was delicious, the chicken was juicy and battered very nicely. My chicken fried steak however, was very bland and there was so much more batter than meat. The gravy was very good and sort of made up for the steak. The brisket sandwich was very dry so we ordered a side of BBQ sauce, without it, it wasn't very appetizing, with it, it was pretty darn good, nothing fancy, just a lot of brisket and bread. The smoked prime rib from the kids menu was OK. It had a lot of fatty parts, I may be biased as I'm not a prime rib fan though. We could definitely taste the smoky flavor. We ordered a side salad with both steak dinners and they both tasted like bagged salad. Nothing great about the dressings either. The mashed potatoes that came with the steaks were pretty good, they had skin pieces which I personally love. No gravy, but I prefer mashed potatoes without so I was happy there.

My favorite dish of the evening was the peach cobbler. The peaches weren't fresh, they were frozen so I was slightly disappointed but the crust part made up for it. The crust, made from their biscuit batter, was slightly sweet and tasted just right with the peaches and vanilla ice cream, (adding ice cream is $1 extra).

Overall, I didn't hate this place but I certainly didn't love it. The portions are massive so go hungry or prepare to take lots of leftovers home."}
{"text":"I love this place.  My husband, daughter and I can all share one order of the chicken fried steak and still have leftovers.  Makes for a cheap dinner out.  The staff is wonderful and very good to our 3 year old.  They also have Shiner Bock Amber.  It doesn't get better than that."}
{"text":"I'm a transplanted Texas girl from Austin. I was craving a taste of home and saw reviews for this place. The atmosphere is great, the waitress was amusingly surly. Sadly the food was terrible. I don't understand actually having a disclaimer on your menu that you don't season your meat?! However that would explain the ridiculous amount of condiments at the table. I ordered the chicken fried steak and was saaaaaadddly disappointed. It is NOT authentic to not season this dish. It literally tasted like a cube steak dipped in a flour/water paste then deep fried. No self-respecting Texan would do this, and you certainly wouldn't add pepporcini pepper sauce or Cholula sauce to a real CFS!  The meat was not the only thing unseasoned, the chicken tenders, potatoes, biscuits and pretty much everything else was tasteless and so bad I couldn't eat it and I LOOOOVE anything fried, so this is pretty bad. We actually felt kind of bad for them when they saw how much food was on the table and we didn't want a take home box.   

I advise they add salt & pepper at the least."}
{"text":"The chicken Fried steak is out of this world. Absolutely delicious a nice place to get together with friends, enjoy."}
{"text":"We were staying in the Phoenix area for two months, and we came here on the recommendation of a neighbor. We waited until our very last night in the area to try Texaz, and boy, are we glad we didn't miss it. There were four of us, and we all ordered the chicken fried steak. Being a native Texan, I had to compare it to the unofficial state dish of Texas. It was hands-down the BEST I've ever eaten, and even the \"small\" portion was huge! The waitstaff is very friendly, and the super nice owner, Steve, came out of the kitchen to visit with us. It was a very enjoyable evening, and we will definitely go again when we're back in Phoenix."}
{"text":"What a great, unique place!  Smoked prime rib is fantastic - juicy, well seasoned, so tasty. Potato wedges are the perfect pairing. Very cold beer completes the Texas experience. Parking is a challenge but worth the trouble."}
{"text":"Besides the great food and service, I love the decor of this corner gem. I'm never disappointed! And I mean, NEVER. I took our youngest, for lunch, and he was mesmerized by all the memorabilia, on the wall and ceiling. It was entertaining, to see the look, on his face. I love it, when I get to surprise, our kids. Even though the youngest, just turned 30. Can't remember what he had, but he devoured, every last bite. I got the country fried steak, and it was enough, for 3 meals. 
This is another place, that has never been a disappointment. If you go, just make sure you go after the rush hour, or you'll have to wait in line. Not that it isn't worth the wait! I just lothe, lines. Go, go, go, and try this place out. Not only, is the food great, I never go, where I don't meet someone, interesting. Reminds me of my Mom & Grandma's restaurant, in Central Illinois,  back in the 50's & 60's. ENJOY!"}
{"text":"My wife and I decided to give this place a try one afternoon after seeing this place for years. One of the major issues we have with places that serve chicken fried steak is that the gravy is usually not very flavorful nor is the steak itself. I'm very pleased to say this place surprised us both. 

It is very obvious that this place puts a lot of hard work and passion into their food. The batter covering the steak was delicious and the meat inside was seasoned up proper and tender. And that gravy covering it? I am licking my lips thinking about it as it had just the right amount of pepper and not overbearing in salt at all! The waitress was super friendly, even gave us a sample of their Texas style chili so we could see what the difference was. 

And the mashed potatoes....were just like the ones my mother would serve on Thanksgiving day; skin on, so you know they're real and lumpy with a delicious butter and pepper taste to them. I'm willing to wager they probably use milk in them just to make them extra fluffy. 

I got the chicken fried steak and my wife got their barbeque sampler. Ribs were a smidge salty but I'm still giving these guys a five star review because it felt so nice eating at a no frills, down home place. I'll make sure next time we go in to save room for their dessert as I do love bread pudding."}
{"text":"This is one of my husbands favorite places for chicken fried steak. I'm not much for fried food, so I didn't order anything. But then my husband ordered his steak, fed me a bite and I remember being startled because it was fresh - not frozen. You could TASTE that it was not frozen. Probably the first restaurant I've been to that didn't have pre-frozen fried food. It's also beer battered. Flippin' delicious. It's basically like going to a southern mama's house and going for a home cooked meal."}
{"text":"Wow, those are big portions. Great food and service. Prices were decent, and the atmosphere was awesome. The catfish and ribeye are worth the trip. Daily specials are a good value with a tinning it home cooking."}
{"text":"Coming from California and came across Texaz. Great food and amazing service! Come with an empty stomach cause it's a lot of food! Matt was extremely friendly and welcoming. Definitely recommend it for other newcomers"}
{"text":"Texas is more known for its sliced brisket, but I was there at lunch and they only had the chopped brisket sandwich available for $6.99 with a side of twice baked potato wedges. Those wedges were crispy and above average, but the brisket was just average in the chopped form. Not sure why Texas places cannot replicate Southern chopped brisket, but it is never as good as down south or southern style places. It wasn't horrible, but the BBQ sauce was watery and did not add much and the bottom bun was soaked through, so no way was this going to be eaten sandwich style. The place was decorated with animal heads and other crazyiness and the parking lot is a very tight squeeze if your there at the wrong time. The waitress was very nice though and it's worth another visit to try something else."}
{"text":"Great place to get delicious Rib Eye and Prime Rib. The portions are good size and the food was good. Coming from San Diego I wished there was a place like this nearby us. All of the staff there was very friendly and pleasant and gave good service. I would try again when back in town."}
{"text":"I grew up in Texas and love coming here for the brisket and the chicken fried steak. The catfish is also worth getting. Very friendly service. The table is loaded with all sorts of hot sauces and condiments to add some kick to your meal. Parking is poor if not awful and the lighting inside is rather dim. Ask for a seat to the left when you walk in by the lamp and beer signs. Oh Yeah!"}
{"text":"Four stars for the food. 

This place is known for their chicken fried steak which is what I had. For me, a little too much breading and not nearly enough gravy. The flavor however was legit. Better than homemade. (I couldn't stand my step mothers chicken fried steak. Lol). 

The plate came with mashed potatoes that were outstanding!  And corn which was as one would expect, and a buttermilk biscuit (nothing to write home about). We got an order of fried okra and that was fantastic. Just the right breading and the dipping sauce was out of this world!

The atmosphere here is of a style I like. Kind of divey, and full of nostalgia. Service was really good, and maybe just a little \"too\" attentive. 

Fun place though!  I'll be back. I want to try their bbq brisket."}
{"text":"Soo good! The atmosphere and the service was great. The chicken fried steak is amazing!  Puts me to sleep every time. A must try."}
{"text":"I have passed it 50 times or so and finally I stopped in to check it out. Well it was nothing like I expected once I opened the door. The place is crammed with dusty Texas stuff from the ceiling down the walls and on the counters. It's a bit over done for my taste. 
The bar sits back from the door along one wall and is small and cramped all other seating appeared to be cramped booths. They offer daily supper specials, but on this evening it was the least appealing of them all. Wednesday Supper Special is Liver & Onions, I don't do Liver & Onions. Instead I had dessert! All desserts are $3.50 unheard of in restaurants anymore! I had the Homemade Hill Country Peach Cobbler, it comes warm so for an extra buck I went A La Mode and had a hefty scoop of Blue Bell Homemade Vanilla Ice Cream. It's a real tasty cobbler and a good size one as well. Tammy the bartender was friendly and quick to serve as well as chat with ya. All the staff seemed pretty easy going and TEXAZ friendly. The menu has a tasty looking line up for both lunch and dinner. Lunch (mostly $7) is substantially less than dinner ($12 - $20) in prices. But one time or another I'll be back to try that awesome looking chicken fried steak or some fried fish or some BBQ spareribs. The place seems mighty fine for down home Texan cookin and it hasn't got a Good Ole Boys feel to it at all, as one person had told me it would."}
{"text":"I really love Comfort Food sometimes!!  And this is AWESOME!  The Chicken Fried Steak, Mashed Potatoes, it is really all good!   And so comfortable inside, so much to look and such a nice change from all of the modern stainless stuff around.  Down home & Comfort food!   Oh and if you have them cook you up a  prime rib for a family get together!  Wow it's great!  :)"}
{"text":"Chicken-fried steak and a Shiner bock doesn't get much more Texas then this. Chicken-fried steaks are huge and you get two of them and some of the best southern bread pudding around. Take some time look around at all the Texas flair on the walls and say hi to the armadillo that greets you at the door."}
{"text":"Texaz Grill has possibly the best chicken fried steak in the state. Their chop steak burgers and ribs are good too. 

I would not recommend getting an actual steak here though. 

I have had mixed experiences with the staff. Some have been rude and uninspired, others have been extremely friendly and helpful. 

The bottom line for me is Texaz grill is my destination of choice for chicken fried steak and ribs. If I am in the mood for a New York Strip or something along those lines, I prefer to go to a chain restaurant."}
{"text":"You won't find better liver & onions anywhere. Cooked perfect, lots of it. Waitresses are the best. The cook however doesn't know when food is done. I've had 6 meals here and anything fried is going to look picture perfect and be uncooked. I know my catfish and this is almost warm on the inside when the coating is perfect. They pride themselves on the chicken fried steak but can't seem to let the batter finish frying. I've tried it over and over and it's always been underdone. My guess is that since I eat there between 2 and 6pm each time, they have the least experienced kitchen person at the fryer. i like to go to local places and will go back here, but i expect i'm going to bang my head on the wall for doing it."}
{"text":"TexAz Grill is the number one restaurant in the entire world.  Just go there everyday and order everything.  Then get coffee and desert. I love the dinner salad, it comes with always perfectly ripe tomatoes and green olives.  I order it with ranch, and add salt and pepper.  Holy cow it is good.  I like all the entrees and specials, order with beer, and chase with coffee, and peach cobbler.  Home run.  Must check this place."}
{"text":"Wow. I have been bragging to my husband about how great this place was for chicken fried steak. I used to go there with coworkers several years ago for lunch. Had such fond memories of the best chicken fried steak I have ever had. 

What happened?  The place was only half full as opposed to having to wait quite awhile for a seat awhile back. We both ordered the CFS and waited anxiously for it to arrive (short wait). What a disappointment. The breading was soggy and somewhat tasteless. The steak overflowed the plate and the gravy was lacking flavor.  Disappointed."}
{"text":"Used to be one of our favs but has gone south very fast. Last two times we have been there the food was not edible. Something is very wrong."}
{"text":"I'm from Vegas visiting my daughter and granddaughter so I stopped by for a margarita on a very hot and humid day. Nice and cool inside but so was the service. Of course I'm a female from out of town so I noticed the male locals received better service. My drinks were good but the ladies were very uptight. Not comfortable at all! Could've been the disabled guest that set them off... if so that's even more un-cool! I'll never go back!"}
{"text":"This place is consistently good. I don't think I have ever had a bad meal here. The chicken fried everything is pretty tasty along with the club that has brisket on it. I try to go here at least a few times a month for lunch."}
{"text":"Went and checked out the place last Saturday. The ambiance is rustic I think. Parking was tricky and definitely not friendly unless you have a compact. The hostess was very friendly. Since the place supposedly has great chicken fried steak, that's what I ordered. To say the portion is ginormous is an understatement. You get two of them that the size as big as your head. The breading's texture is great with a nice crunch. The steak is very tender and not dry. My only complaint would be that the food is BLAND! The breading definitely could've used some flavor or spice and so did the gravy. Odd that the steak is such huge portion but the gravy is very much skimped on. I liked it, but it definitely could use some major seasoning. Maybe they can steal it from Chili's. Even though Chili's is a chain, they have one of the best chicken fried steak I've had. Texaz grilled would've definitely got 4 stars if they seasoned the CFS."}
{"text":"The service at this restaurant is some of the best I've seen in the valley. The moment you walk in the door you are greeted warmly from servers, the hostess and even the manager/owner... I'm still not quite sure who he was but everyone was amazing and friendly from the moment we walked in until the moment we left. Our server was like a second mom, doting on our boys and always making sure we had everything we needed. I chose this restaurant for my birthday dinner because I knew we'd be going out with our two small boys and thought it would be a fun experience for everyone. I ordered the chicken fried steak because that is what they're famous for. It was a gigantic and I could only finished half of it. I would highly suggest if you don't have a Texas size appetite to do the half order or split it with someone. A little detail to most but a big thing for me was that they served green olives chopped up on their dinner salad and I loved it. We will definitely be back. My only negative on this restaurant is the lack of parking space, but this is a common issue in the central Phoenix area."}
{"text":"I was craving for country fried steak and drove to this restaurant to fulfill it. As you enter the restaurant you will notice the hats, license plates, nostalgic Texas decoration. It feels like you've been transformed into a Texas country bar. We were immediately greeted by the hostess and sat down inside of a booth. The menu is right side up on the table. Inside the menu are comfort foods to order such as, chicken fried steak, fried okra, steak and burgers. Of course, I ordered the chicken fried steak with the gravy on the side; it was so delicious. Five stars!! It was good enough to feed two people. Additionally, the bread pudding is served warm with whiskey sauce. It was a perfect ending to dinner when you're all fried up!"}
{"text":"I've been wanting to hit up TEXAZ Grill for a while and finally got a chance to last week for lunch. Had read about their chicken fried steak and my mouth was watering before I arrived just thinking about it. Unfortunately, I was completely underwhelmed by my plate. The portion was large and reasonably priced for lunch, but everything on the plate was so bland. The CSF also tasted more stale instead of having a nice, crispy crunch. My friend had the catfish poboy which wasn't anything special. I'll give them the home-fried potatoes...nice crisp outside and perfectly cooked inside. Waitress was friendly and efficient. Prices are a lot more expensive for dinner. Probably won't be back."}
{"text":"If you are a person like me who likes a lot of variety this is NOT the place for you.. 3 different items I wanted they ran out of and what they did have was not that great.  I ordered the prime rib sandwich which was more more that 4 strips of prime rib placed on top of a French roll which tasted like onion because they put a giant thicker slice of onion under it. The mashed potatoes were okay nothing g special. We also ordered the frito pie. It was nothing more the a tiny bag of Fritos with a small amount t of chili dumped inside. Will never go back"}
{"text":"Not color friendly if you get my drift. Just speaking the truth."}
{"text":"Best food in the valley! I love this place! I go there about twice a month! I would go there more often but I live in Tempe. This place is worth the drive if you live within a hour of this place. I would eat there three times a week if it was in my neck of the woods! Way to Tex az you got a customer for life!!!!!"}
{"text":"Very good food! The décor is very busy with a cluttered distracting allure. Kind of a dive bar type ambiance."}
{"text":"I'm so in love with the Chicken Fried Chicken, it's juicy and delicious. I admit it's really my favorite thing to eat here. I always think about, maybe switching things up, ordering something else. But no, I can't it's just too amazing. Ok so I've mistakenly ordered the fried steak, which turned out to be a happy accident. It too, tasted great. I've also tried, bites of other dishes, and pretty much everything tastes great. Portions are really generous. I usually end up boxing up about half of my meal. The salad and bread, do me in almost every time. Texaz has a \"Clean Plate Club Card\" sadly, I only have few stamps, I doubt I'll ever fill it. Even if I did, I wouldn't be able to enjoy the desert that's rewarded when your card is fully stamped. 

My Family has enjoyed eating at Texaz for many years now. Texaz is always amazing, every single time!"}
{"text":"We have been going to this place for years. It is my fiance's favorite restaurant and the place he requests for his birthday dinner every year. We came here for Valentine's even though it was a bit of a drive and once again, worth the gas! My steak was cooked to perfection and everything was on point including the service.. And the prickly pear margaritas!! And you get free cake on Valentine's?! Say what?!! I think this will be a new Valentine's tradition!!!"}
{"text":"Best chicken fried steak ever!!! They have huge portions, great service, and the food is delicious. One if my favorite parts is the atmosphere inside. It's a really cool spot. Owners are always there working and walking around. Awesome spot!

*phoenix foodies approved"}
{"text":"Yes! The best preparation for a chicken fried steak I have had in Phoenix so far.  With that said the gravy was lacking in flavor.  Whether this was intentional or not, I had to put a lot of salt and pepper on it to taste the gravy.

The atmosphere is what you would expect from a diner.  Trucker hats and outdated memorabilia galore. The best part of the experience was the owner/chef coming out to converse with everyone in the restaurant to see how the food was.  Props for that!  The staff was also very friendly and attentive.  

Plan in gaining a pound or two when eating here.  I give this 4 stars for the great home style cooking you would expect from a noted local restaurant.  Minus one star for possibly having a little too high of expectations of the food."}
{"text":"Peach cobbler hands down the best. Son likes fried catfish and chicken fried chicken.

I like the ambiance like a dive kind of place

Best food for hungry man....that's for sure. He's only 18, but my hungry man son likes big portions and lots of heavy foods. 
Susan, night manager is super nice too."}
{"text":"First time here after many recommendations. Tried the Chicken Fried Steak. It did not disappoint! Huge and delicious. The chef came out to check on our meal to make sure it was to our liking. Great service, and great food!"}
{"text":"Sometimes, predictable is a good thing.
A dear friend moved away and was coming to visit for a weekend. Turns out, despite being a sucker for anything chicken fried, she had never heard of TEXAZ. So we put together a small dinner party (8 of us) to celebrate her being in town.

The server was fantastic! We all came in at different times, she never missed a beat with greeting us, getting us drinks and taking care of all the substitutions and special requests in our food order. Everything arrived exactly as ordered - and we were a happy and full group of people.

The food is still consistent, the ambiance is still kitschy Texas roadhouse dive, the prices are still very reasonable and I am still super happy TEXAS is in my hood."}
{"text":"They don't make steakhouses like this anymore, fitting because you can't find this food anywhere else but TEXAZ Grill on 16th st and Bethany. Sure the parking lot is tiny and the original 70/80's decor is now full cycle into hip retro territory but by all that is righteous and proper in this world their CHICKEN FRIED STEAK and CHICKEN FRIED CHICKEN (yup, fried chicken breasts) is mind numbingly delicious. 

This place is a must have for any true local Phoenician. Leave your ego at the door, they don't care. Comfortable and better than home. Good for the whole family or yourself looking for a meal."}
{"text":"I've been to TEXAZ grill for dinner in the past but this is the first time for brunch. Once again they didn't disappoint. There were 6 in our group we ordered:

3) Chicken Fried Goodness - House specialty - choice of tenderized beef steak, boneless chicken breast or boneless pork loin chop, double dipped, fried, and covered with cream gravy. Served with award winning mashed potatoes and gravy, corn and a buttermilk biscuit.  We tried all 3 meat types all the plates were great.

2) Biscuits and Gravy - Two buttermilk? biscuits covered in sausage gravy. Great taste, fresh biscuits and plenty of sausage in the gravy.

1) Bacon or Sausage & Eggs - Bacon or hot country sausage patty with 2 eggs cooked to order & a biscuit.  Eggs cooked perfectly, great tasted sausage and fresh biscuit."}
{"text":"If you're looking for a place of elegance, this is not the place for you.  It's dark, dingy and a hole in the wall ..... and the food is AMAZING.  Five of us went in for lunch on a Friday afternoon (one being a former Texan, only just moving to Arizona two months ago) and the wait for a table was non-existent.  Our service was very good and attentive.  Three of us ordered the chicken fried steak and two of us ordered the BBQ brisket sandwich.  Every single one of us was extremely pleased with our food and SO MUCH FOOD.  I would definitely recommend this place for some good Texan food!  Prices were unbelievably reasonable as well."}
{"text":"There's probably not a lot that can be said about TexAz Grill that hasn't been said, but  I feel the need to put in a good word for their catfish. It's great - perfectly battered, flaky, great flavor and the two massive fillets are enough to share with a friend, making it a fairly inexpensive, reasonably healthful dinner for two."}
{"text":"Today was my free birthday lunch. I had an extremely rare rib eye and Julie had the massive chicken fried steak. It was pretty quiet the day after Thanksgiving. Service is excellent. Limited beer menu. Great desserts
We live on the west side so only come over for special events. Great decor. Its too bad they took the vintage fishing lures of the mirror in the mens room. Guess they got stolen. It was pretty unique"}
{"text":"Once again some time has passed before we came here for dinner but we find ourselves happy we made our way back. The meal starts off with a simple salad and some fabulous biscuits and the entree was a massive serving of chicken fried chicken. We left happy and stuffed. The service was friendly efficient and there is a lot of look at on the walls and ceiling. It does appear that the menu is much smaller since our last visit but we got what we went there for so that was no concern to us."}
{"text":"I LOVE chicken fried steak and a family friend told me I HAD to try this place. And I'm so happy I did so.  The chicken fried steak was delicious. The batter was light and crispy, the steak was moist and the country gravy, to die for.  I've had plenty of chewy chicken fried steak in my life with mediocre gravy. This was definitely the BEST chicken fried steak I've ever had. The waitress was super busy as they bus their own tables, but we never felt neglected. I just noticed how busy she was.  So the fact that she was slammed and her service never suffered was huge to me.  The manager or maybe the owner was coming around to all the tables and asking everyone how the food was and chatting with the regulars. I love that type of service. We raved about the food and told him it was our first time in and he gave me and my mother a card for a free dessert on our next visit!!  So what else can I do BUT give this place 5 stars.  Wonderful home cooking and great service."}
{"text":"We had the rib eye and the chicken fried steak. Both entrees were delicious, great flavor, cooked to perfection. You will not be disappointed!"}
{"text":"The food is so good that I wish I could eat there every day. I love their lunch time specials.  Tuesday is a must for ham steak  Wednesday is a must for liver and onions .  Thursdays for ribs or prime rib (almost a half pound).  Friday is the best fish in town.
Nancy, the werver is simply great!"}
{"text":"A long standing landmark that I recently visited for lunch was found to be a real treat. I have given this establishment 4 stars not for the venue or the ambiance of the furnishings, but, for the quality of the food, service and the wholesomeness of the experience. The food is home cooked and portions are very generous.  Their chicken fried steak is one of the main stays of this business. I had that item for my lunch. I took home the remains of my lunch and my wife and finished for lunch the next day. The steak hangs over all sides of the plate. The price of $9 was  a real bargain. 
If in the area or if you want to try a restaurant that represents what the old west was about 50 years ago, this is the place. Nothing fancy just good fixins."}
{"text":"Positive: The portion size are huge, especially the chicken fried steak. Service was quick however food was warm.
Negative: The establishment has hats and business cards hanging all over the place from the ceiling, thousands of them...all I can think of is 'dust and dirt.' Also, I heard one waitress say \"stupid table!\" and another one say \"dickhead!\" behind me at my table. Unsure who they were referring too. 
Overall: Food is good, service needs to be more friendlier and establishment needs to look cleaner."}
{"text":"Fun, friendly, prompt service and tasty food? What's not to like? Portions here are definitely Texas-size so you are not going to go away hungry. They were very accommodating to our large party and our server was excellent. 

Parking here is HORRIBLE though. The restaurant is on the corner of 16th St. and Bethany Home in a rundown strip mall. The spots themselves are short and it's difficult to get into and out of the lot. Not sure if there is a special trick to parking here but please keep in mind when you come that parking is sucky. 

Now, bear in mind when you come here, there are not many \"healthy options\" on the menu. And they are not ashamed of this at all. They embrace the Texas size deep fried, heavily battered foods they offer unabashedly. As someone who is careful about what I eat, I did manage to get a salad and felt good about it. All the dishes came out at the proper temperatures and were freshly made and nicely plated. 

Looking forward to going back in the near future!"}
{"text":"This place is great and Steve, the owner, is always there and stops by to chat often.  I ALWAYS have the chicken fried chicken sandy with longhorn cheddar.  Fantastic!  They have a secret sauce that goes well with the sandy, its basically a glorified thousand island.  It comes with a side of the house gravy that I use with the potatoes.  The wife ALWAYS has the catfish and she just loves it.  The soup yesterday was a Mexican cheese soup, tomato based with spices and longhorn cheddar.  Let me tell you that this soup was out of this world.  I will be checking the website often to see when it is back and will surly go have it again.  Most of the soups are great and every day there are different specials.  Definitely have to check this place out if you have not been."}
{"text":"Best food ever! Get the chicken fried steak and the smoked prime rib! Peach cobbler is amazing too! The atmosphere and hospitality in here are great. Try the homemade titos vodka."}
{"text":"First time here, been meaning to try it for years.  The fried okra is good, as was the coleslaw.  I ordered the \"small\" chicken fried chicken with mashed potatoes, it was delish.  Couldn't finish it.   Boyfriend had the regular order of Chicken fried steak and it was huge.  Couldnt finish it. Our waitress was SUPER nice and the food and drinks came timely.  Great hospitality, great food.  Yummy comfort food, country restaurant with a very inviting and homeie feel.  We will eat here again."}
{"text":"Found this on Yelp & decided we HAD to come check it out. I'm a huge fan of chicken fried chicken, I know everyone said this was known for the steak but I figured they would both be great.  I was correct! Our server & all other staff we came in contact with was super sweet. Our food came out piping hot exactly how we ordered it. Huge pieces of chicken, my husband & I could of easily shared it. Only complaint was the breading fell off of every piece I would cut. Eh. Oh well. We will def be back."}
{"text":"I ordered my meal and within three minutes there is my plate of chicken fried steak wow I thought three big giant pieces of chicken fried steak until I go to move it and I realize it's one piece and the coating which was practically not cooked had peeled right off. I have a 7 year old granddaughter who does a lot better job at making chicken fried steak."}
{"text":"I gotta give it to TEXAZ for the huge portions that come out of that kitchen, very Texan indeed. I could seriously split an entrée if I was pretty hungry, and I don't say that much. So, do yourself a favor and don't be worried about how many calories you're about to intake when you visit this establishment.

Now, the food itself was okay. I was seriously expecting an explosion of chicken fried steak in my face! I was ready for pure sodium sin that would allow my taste buds to dance in circles around every morsel with pitch forks raised in true devil worshiping style. This was probably why I wasn't insanely impressed. The steak itself was pretty good, but the gravy wasn't what I expected at all. I've been spoiled in the past with overwhelmingly flavorful sausage gravy with biscuits, and that's what I was expecting. So be warned if you're expecting something similar to that. But, again mentioning portions, that was the biggest chicken fried steak that I've ever had.

Fried okra, a dinner salad and their red chili were also chosen off the menu that night. The okra was pretty good, just battered and deep fried, and served with some sort of sauce (I didn't examine it well enough to say what it was). The salads were pretty good, but go for the vinaigrette because the ranch was sort of bland. Oh, and be prepared for a lot of dressing. Lastly, the chili...it was served the proper way with cheese and onions, which was nice, but I wasn't blown away with the flavor of this either. In all honesty, it seemed like they meant to cook it with MGD, but didn't cook all of the alcohol out...it was essentially beer flavored chili.

I'm going to go back to TEXAZ for sure (waitress was pretty sweet by the way), but I think my next visit will be for lunch. Some of their sandwiches look fantastic, and I'm really hoping to become a big fan of TEXAZ after trying some of them."}
{"text":"Amazingly delish! I couldn't even begin to tell you how yummy all the food was. Totally coming back! Had the Chicken Fried Chicken, but coming back for the Prime Rib and Pork Chop!!! Must come and visit!!"}
{"text":"Holy smokes!  I ate here tonight and wow.  It has been several years since I have been to TEXAZ and now I wonder why I don't go at least once a year.  My poor heart is working hard tonight.  I had the chicken fried steak and split a shrimp cocktail.  

The shrimp was fresh and huge.  The steak was delicious and I love their mashed potatoes and country gravy.  The portions are gigantic and very affordable.  I will have to visit at least once a year. I think that is all my poor heart and arteries can handle."}
{"text":"Coolest restaurant! Neat atmosphere, awesome service. I had the chicken fried chicken and it was really good. Would definitely recommend to others stopping by town or people who live here. I've heard it's best to get there earlier if you want the steaks!"}
{"text":"I was looking forward to trying this place for a long time.  The reviews on Yelp were good and I was told by a fellow steak lover that if I wanted a great (not the best) cut of steak at a reasonable price, then Texaz is the place to go.  I went on a Thursday evening and the place was pretty busy.  I was seated right away by a very friendly hostess.  You could tell from the looks of the place that it had been around a while.  I could have sworn my booth was going to fall apart, but it was ok.  The décor is a bit eccentric with anything and everything having to do with Texas all over the walls.  All the patrons seemed to be having a good time and enjoying their meals.  There were also plenty of wait staff bustling around.

While everything on the menu sounded delicious (but NOT diet friendly), I opted for the filet.  Next time I am going to order the prime rib or the chicken friend steak because I hear those are excellent.  My salad came quickly and was very good.  However, it was a bit odd because it contained diced green olives (which I normally don't like), but I said what the heck and ate it all anyway.  I was pleasantly surprised.  When the steak arrived I was surprised again at the size.  I was expecting it to be much smaller but it was a pretty big cut.  I'm guessing around 8-10oz.  I love it when steaks are cooked in plenty of butter (gross to some people...I know) and I guess this place knew that because there was plenty of the hot, melty goodness all over the steak and plate!  It was soooo good but soooo unhealthy.  It was cooked perfectly and I ate every bite.  The potatoes were just ok but I ate them anyway.  Nothing a bunch of salt and ketchup couldn't fix.  For dessert I ordered the homemade pecan pie and it was probably among the best I have ever had.

If you are looking for an upscale steak/bbq joint then this is NOT the place for you.  If you are looking for place with some good meat with good prices and excellent service, then this is the place for you."}
{"text":"My FAVORITE!  Best Catfish, Best Friday Fish and Chips, Best Peach Cobbler; as well as all the other goodies on the Menu. I bring all my friends from out of town here. The serving staff is friendly, and stable (meaning that they've been there for years...). They all know me by name and are wonderful. Steve the owner always hangs out meeting his guests too. If looking for a very reasonably priced American (Texas/southern) Café, then this is the place. You will be delighted. Its been open over 25-years, same owner, and the quality is consistently superior. Its the treat I've given myself every week for over 15-years."}
{"text":"Excellent service, fun atmosphere, friendly staff, food choices were enormous, food was plentiful and delicious."}
{"text":"I love the chicken fried steak! Me and the wife could have definitely split it. It would have been plenty for 2 people. The ambience is ok but the food makes up for it. 

As all the other reviews say \"get the chicken fried steak!\""}
{"text":"This place has great comfort food, nothing fancy but I don't expect nor want it from a place like this. We have been here twice and both times were excellent. The first time around I ordered the chicken fried steak and it was flavorful not to mention massive. This last time I decided to change things up and get the catfish, and I have to say this was easily the best catfish I've gotten from a restaurant, it is perfectly seasoned and melts in your mouth. Catfish isn't my favorite fish and far too many places can't make it properly, the sweetness of the catfish almost overpowers things. Not here, the flavor of the breading and the work in harmony. I will definitely get catfish again here! Oh yeah, their Texas Potatoes (or whatever they are called) are good as well, basically they are potato chunks that are fried, in fact I am willing to bet they double fry them to give the outerlayer a crispy texture. 

The restaurant itself resembles your typical small town restaurant, and that is fine with me since I grew up with restaurants like it. Their walls are covered with pictures, posters, signs and whatever else they can put up on it, it gives it an unique look. If you want a \"nice\" restaurant then you better look elsewhere, but if you want a hometown family restaurant and bar setting this is your place.

Service is fantastic as well, our server was constantly refilling our drinks and extremely friendly. One nice aspect of this place is that they give you large glasses for your beverage, so you usually only need a refill or two, we had a bit more because we were recovering from the summer heat.  Also for the record they carry Pepsi products, which is a bonus for me, but may not be for others.

In regards to price, they aren't cheap (the chicken fried steak is around 13 and the catfish for two big filets was around 12), but you will have more then enough food so it works out in the long run. 

Overall a great small town style restaurant and bar if you are looking for a hearty meal that is made right."}
{"text":"Cool place Absolutely filled with Texas memorabilia. Authentic Texas diner style food. I had the Brisket sandwich which was very big and delicious. My dining companions had the Chicken Fried Steak which was gigantic and delicious. They have Shiner Bock beer(Texas Beer). Parking is a bit tight but worth it. Lunch prices are very reasonable.
Four Stars. I will be back to try more."}
{"text":"Great chicken fried steak in phoenix but if it was in Texas it would be just good"}
{"text":"I have been eating here for years. Great food.  Portions are smaller than they where a few years ago, and the pricing has gone up. The mashed potatoes and country grave is second only to my mothers. My kids can share the chicken fried chicken. So much chicken!"}
{"text":"This is simply the best Chicken Fried Steak in phoenix - and the Steaks are good too. Definatly one of my top 10 favorites.

We often visit for lunch which is quite reasonably prices and exceptionally good. So finding a higher price for dinner was supurising untill the waitress informed us that they didnt give you one huge/gigantic chicken fried steak but two. I had to try to eat both but found it impossible - but was good the next day for lunch. I would have tried for breakfast but found myself still too full.

The food is Superb
The Service is Superb
The Atmosphere is Great

Have eaten the Steaks here as well - as good a most steakhouses
The ribs are very good as well - on par with most bbq places
The Red Eye gravy - just try it, will suprise you how good it is"}
{"text":"If you read my profile, in the section that states last meal on earth it says - chicken fried steak.   Which just happens to be the specialty of the house here so 1 + 1 = chicken fried steak for dinner at the Texaz Grill.   

Like some of the other reviews say the portions are \"Texas size\"  and they ain't lying.  Over all the meal was good - 2 huge slabs of chicken fried steak, real mashed potatoes, tasty biscuits and a Shiner Bock or two to wash it down.  I rolled out of the place and still am in a food coma."}
{"text":"It's a beef place. I get it.  BUT....yours truly was in the mood for Catfish so I took a chance and WON!

This catfish was super crispy on the outside. Fluffy and plump on the inside. Just delicious.  Added a side of creamy peppery thin cut coleslaw and some chunky potatoes.  Tabasco, Lemon, Tartar Sauce.........tastebuds are happy.

First time ever tried Bread Pudding (YUM) and a Booker's Single Barrel Bourbon on the side was a perfect finish to a perfect meal."}
{"text":"I work at the sundevil auto right down the street. Me and my techs eat here 2 to 3 times a week !!!!  The service is absolutely amazing and the food is to die for !!! If I was not worried about having a heart attack from the delicious food I would eat here every day !!!!   Well done and keep it up."}
{"text":"This place is spot on!  Great service, salad and the chicken fried steak is out of this world!  We are here from Texas and have certainly had our fair share of excellent chicken fried steak, this place does it right!  Huge servings and incredible flavor!  Give this one a try!  You won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"Chicken Fried Steak, Chicken Fried Steak, Ribeye, Chicken Fried Steak. I've been have chicken fried steak here since they opened and it hasn't changed in all these years. The food is awesome, I've never had bad service and the quantity is fantastic. I love getting the box of left overs for tomorrow lunch.
I almost deducted a star because of parking, but decided it's worthy of all 5 because at least my car has AC to wait for a space. 
PS, be sure and save enough room for the pecan pie, its wonderful."}
{"text":"I had the lunch special, cermitas, it was phenomenal! One of the best bbq sandwiches I've had ever. The prices are great, especially for the amount of food served. Service was speedy & friendly."}
{"text":"TexAZ Grill does one thing & does it well: STEAK. (Actually, they'll cook yours to order, not just well.) 

You'll get a reasonably priced, delectably tender portion of your favorite cut of meat. Their mashed & baked potatoes are good, so is the coleslaw. Salads are lackluster, mostly iceberg lettuce, cardboard-like tomatoes, served as a vehicle for the dressing. But you don't go to TexAZ for rabbit food, you go for meat. And Texas beer. 

Best steak within 20 miles. 

Used to be the best deal around, too, but as of mid-2008, prices have been raised - plan on $20+ per person if you want a meal and a beer, $14-17 per person if you just drink water."}
{"text":"I seriously cannot think of a reason to deduct a star from Texaz. It's about as authentic as you can get without going back in time.  The food is consistent and delicious. I'm a purist so I used to order the chicken fried steak but have since broadened my horizons and have started ordering the chicken fried chicken which is, in my opinion, better. I also really appreciate the fact that they started offering half orders because their regular portion sizes are ginormous (though the leftovers are also delicious). 

This is probably one of my more boring reviews because I don't have anything to snark about with Texaz.  I actually joined their email list just because they seem like nice people and I'd like to hear from them more often.  Their food also cures all hangovers and it is the absolute perfect place to go on Sunday night after a long weekend of liver damage in Vegas (learned this last weekend). Five Stars."}
{"text":"Had dinner here the other night. What a cool concept - with all the decor, I truly felt I was in the heart of Texas!

We ordered the smoked prime rib meal, which included biscuit and roll, salad, mashed potatoes/gravy and prime rib. The prime rib was done perfectly, and had a great smoky flavor. Big big portions too. My only complaint would be that my prime rib was just a tad cool (temperature) - should have been a little warmer. But at least it wasn't overcooked!

Great atmosphere, and fun place."}
{"text":"Good honest food.   I don't know what I could possibly say that hasn't been said already.   Go and see for yourself.   I'd get the prime rib any day of the week.   The chicken fried pork and chicken is great as well.   Real mashed potatoes and creamy chicken gravy are just perfect.   Try the bread pudding if you have any room left,  but I bet you won't."}
{"text":"Perfect.  Authentic. Delicious. What more can you say. If you are familiar with Texas food, this joint is great."}
{"text":"We came here after seeing this resturant on check please.  They did not have the rice balls which you only get on Sunday my wife and I thought that this was an ok restaurant here everything looked really good on Check Please but after we got there most of the things were really without a lot of flavor. The chicken fried steak and chicken fried chicken was very crispy but they didn't have much flavor. Our dinner mates felt the same way about the chicken and sides. Lots of food, but the flavor was lacking."}
{"text":"This restaurant is very good if you are looking for a hearty meal with large portions. The chicken fried steak is the bomb - the best in Arizona. The staff is super friendly and the atmosphere is unique. I just wish it was closer to my home in Gilbert. Highly Recommended."}
{"text":"Very good chicken fried steak. Okra. And mashed potatoes. Makes great leftovers if you can't finish!"}
{"text":"Our new favorite restaurant! The food was amazing, the staff was incredible, and there just arent enough good things to say about TexAZ Grill! My only regret is that I we hadn't  tried it sooner. Please put a location in the West Valley!!"}
{"text":"Good food and large portions. Ordered the prime rib it was so soft and juicy. Hubby ordered rib eye his was soft and yummy. Has a real Texas road house feel to the restaurant. Excellent food."}
{"text":"I like such places. This is a place for locals and families. The food was good and quickly came out. They are famous for their chicken fried steak. The serving size is very generous."}
{"text":"Being Texas-transplants, we'd been wanting to try TEXAZ Grill for some time, (but it's pretty far from the 'Copa). Upon entering, we thought we'd found another treasure like the renowned Babe's Fried Chicken as the décor is really cool, and there is a friendly, upbeat vibe. 

Our waitress was super! 

Two glasses of Chardonnay were very good, and a bargain for $5 each. 

As others have mentioned, the portions are HUGE, and the mashed potatoes, biscuit and corn were excellent! 

Unfortunately, the stars of the show, Chicken Fried Steak and Chicken Fried Chicken were just fair. The CFS was the biggest disappointment as it lacked proper seasoning, and was pounded way too thin which causes over-breading. The CHC was better and was perfectly cooked, but a bit over-breaded and needed more seasoning as well (Churches or Popeyes is better). 

As any Texan well knows, you can hide a lot of mediocre food under outstanding gravy (sorry Mom) but we found the gravy slightly sweet for our palettes. 

We will certainly be back to try the brisket as it smelled great!"}
{"text":"I've been eating here since I was a kid...we'd drive from 99th and Indian School just to eat at this restaurant (it used to be called Lone Star, but they had to change the name because the crappy restaurant chain of that name legally forced them to change names when the chain moved into town.) 

I'd still drive 40 miles to go to Texaz Grill.  The fillet is wonderful (sometimes I get it without the butter).  They have the best mashed potatoes in the state, swimming in a HUGE amount of gravy (good stuff, but I typically spoon off a bit).  The salad is fantastic (chopped green olives on top...who'd a thought they'd taste so good on a salad with ranch?!)

Service is good.  They don't mess around here...good food, good atmosphere, decent pricing for what you get."}
{"text":"This place was horrible. We are a large Hispanic family and the way we were treated, it felt as though we were in the 1960s and the civil rights movement had just ended. The waitress who took our order was rude, every little thing we asked for seemed like the biggest problem.

But the real issue was when the second waitress came and asked my husband to scoot in closer to the table because the lady behind him couldn't sit comfortable enough - mind you, said lady stopped her and told her she was fine - but the waitress insisted that he need to move to an uncomfortable position so that the other person would be better (HE WAS ALREADY SITTING WITH HIS BODY TOCHING THE TABLE)! Absolutely rude, uncalled for, and unnecessary - as clients our needs were, clearly, of less importance - which left us wondering why? From the moment we walked in, we received nothing but attitude, especially in comparison to everyone else enjoying their meals.

The food wasn't good and even if it had any goodness in it, we didn't taste it because we were beyond upset. It was incredible that there is such an atmosphere that still exist this way - we were in shock. 

The most aggravating part? We were only in Phoenix for the day - we live in TEXAS! This restaurant is the most abominable example of Texas food and hospitality, if you really want something from the Texas menu then please come and eat here, in Texas - we really are a friendly state! This restaurant, in the very least, should change their name because it was nowhere close to the Texas environment - I found it an embarrassment as a born & raised TEXAN!"}
{"text":"Walking in, the decor was just ok.  We had the chicken fried steak, kids prime rib, and rib eye.  The prime rib was smoked and they didn't say that on the kids menu and it had an odd taste to it.  I liked the ice cream cup at the end of my meal.

Editing to three stars.  GREAT customer service."}
{"text":"The filet here is awesome at only $22 (with fries, a salad, and biscuits and bread). Additionally, there is great Texas stuff all over the walls, with a definite focus on the Big Bend (Marfa, Terlingua, etc.) and Gulf Coast regions. Good weeknight specials, but I have not tried weekend brunch yet. I've been here about 3 times."}
{"text":"This has been on my AZ bucket list for years and decided to drop by tonight for dinner with the family. From chatting it up with some of the regulars, to the \"Texas Trivia\" with the owner at our table. The food and the vibe here were absolutely wonderful. Will definitely be back again and again!"}
{"text":"The so called famous chicken fried steak was too bland and mostly batter. They also ran out of BBQ ribs on a Saturday night which is apparently due to lack of planning I suppose. Price is too expensive for the quality of food."}
{"text":"Place has Texas ambiance in spades.  You leave the cavernous restaurant and you almost expect to step onto a dusty street in the panhandle.  The chicken fried steak is great and when you consider the $8 price tag it becomes downright splendid."}
{"text":"This is the ONLY place to get Chicken Fried Steak! The portions are HUGE so bring your appetite. The pulled pork is good too! Just took some visiting friends this last week and it was delicious as always. They loved it. These guys are very consistent and the service is excellent! The have a cool little bar too. Not really for families... this is for the grown-ups!"}
{"text":"Came here with family for dinner. Had smoke prime rib!! It was amazing I can't wait to go back !!! Everyone in the family had something different so we all tried a bite or two of different plates   Yum !!!!"}
{"text":"Id definitely recommend this texas style hole in the wall joint.  It reminds me of my days I texas.  Funny bumper stickers and hats as decor. Expire fed friendly waitstaff that know how to get you feeling comfortable or put you I your place.  
I went with a cold bud light as the domestic choices just spoke to me! The chopped brisket sandwich was really quiet good despite being served upside down.  Maybe that's the thing.  I ordered a frito pie and and it came on bag ready to go.  What a good ole Sunday place.
They brought be a fun little fried rice cake beignet thing with a good amount of powdered sugar and life was good. 
If this place wasn't in a strip center I think you'd believe you were in a shack on a ranch grubbing down.
Enjoy!"}
{"text":"We heard great things from a coworker about this place.  We took the opportunity of being in Phoenix proper to swing by for dinner.  Service was friendly and reasonably efficient.  We ordered the chicken-fried steak and smoked prime rib.  We got the LAST piece of prime rib (it's limited every day, apparently).

The smoked prime rib was a bit fatty, but the flavor was very good.  The chicken-fried steak seemed to be a lot more breading than steak.  Believe it or not Denny's has a better breading/steak ratio.  The breading itself didn't seem to have any flavor or seasoning to it.  Usually I go very light on the cream sauce when I order a chicken-fried steak, but here you need to go heavier to give it more flavor.  Now to be fair it was really good when I did that, but I think that was much more the sauce than the steak.  Which just seems wrong to me.  The sauce should enhance the flavor, not embody all the flavor.  That's why I can't bring myself to go to four stars.  I could have put the sauce on a piece of bread and probably gotten about the same flavor experience.

Portions were pretty generous, and the sides were basic but good."}
{"text":"We went here for lunch today, the food was pretty bad. I ordered the big Texas sandwich or whatever it's called and it was almost inedible. It had the cheap Kraft cheese barley melted on it and weird coleslaw...? Anyways, I originally tried to order chicken tenders and fries and was told by the waitress I wasn't allowed because I wasn't a child. I had a child at the table sitting right next to me?! She said the cooks wouldn't make it for me because it wasn't actually for the child it was for me.... ummm.. okay? So I end up with this crappy sand which instead.  The waitress was a little rude. The only positive was the manager he was super friendly, he seemed like a genuinely good person. I almost feel bad writing this review because he was so nice. But hopefully he will see this and make some changes! Also, the high chairs are super sketchy. It was hanging off the table by two bars, hardly secured on there. The waitress told me they can put a chair under it Incase it falls... yea, nooo thanks! I would just rather my child not fall at all! Lol"}
{"text":"If you're expecting fine dining by candlelight, you're looking in the wrong place. TEXAZ GRILL is a down home, stick to your ribs place to get DELICIOUS food and good value as well!
The staff have always been friendly and efficient. The atmosphere is relaxed, so loosen your tie, and your belt for that matter.
If you've got the right attitude and appetite, you can't really go wrong here. 
Granted, this is NOT Health food and not advertised as such, but for a truly guilty pleasure when my stomach's grumbling, you'll find me waiting at a table for a chicken fried steak. Drooling! :-)
Thanks TEXAZ GRILL family. You've been MY personal go to restaurant for about 20 years. Have never been disappointed!"}
{"text":"I have been going to this restaurant for years, even before it was Texaz when it used to be known as Lonestar.  They have been in the valley for YEARS and I can understand why.  Their food is simple and DELICIOUS.  Their chicken fried steak is huge and I cannot even begin to describe the flavor.  Their steaks are always perfectly cooked perfection and I always leave feeling full and satisfied.  If you're looking for a casual night out with delicious steak and potatoes I would recommend this place.  It's also fun to see what they've got on their walls as the place is packed with fun trinkets."}
{"text":"Love the staff, love the atmosphere, love the coleslaw, love the biscuits, love the chicken fried steak, grilled cod (not on the menu), love this place. Parking sucks!"}
{"text":"Sometimes a girl gets a wicked hankerin' for some chicken fried steak, mashed taters, and white gravy.  You know that what she does?  She goes to Texaz Grill.

For a ridiculously satisfying and heart clogging meal, you can't beat it.  It's got a casual and fun atmosphere, and it's extremely reasonably priced.  And best of all, the bar has a total honky tonk feel that makes me want to run home and play Urban Cowboy with the mister."}
{"text":"Let's say that this is homestyle cooking. The food was ample in portion but needs a little lift. The salad is very basic and bland. Needs a little color and flavour. There was not a lot of excitement from the start.

I was craving a great steak and I had never been here before. The Ribeye (My favorite cut) was lacking in the quality of the beef. It tastes like grocery store Holstein and looked like it when it cooked up too. The meal covered my hunger bit I felt this place could be so much better with just a little tweeking. 

The decor I loved and it screams Texas. It was fun to read the articles and see all of the hats hanging from the ceiling. As always, I may have just caught it on an off day. Check it out for yourself."}
{"text":"I came to this location months ago and I still remember how delicious our food was! I got the pork ribs and my husband got the chicken fried steak, which is about the size of a horse, and smothered in gravy. The food was delectable, myself being a Texas native was more than pleased with the quality of the food and service! Great place, great food and great environment!"}
{"text":"Great ribeye and newyork! Anytime my wife and I are craving a good steak we end up here."}
{"text":"This is good-ole, down home cookin'. And yes, the chicken-fried steak is quite possibly the best around."}
{"text":"I have been coming here for years and never have I had bad service or food! The best Chicken Fried Steak I've ever had. Everything is fresh, hot and homemade! What more could you ask for!! Granted it's not the healthiest but for a special treat it is sooooo worth it!"}
{"text":"So, I kinda grew up on chicken fried steak.  Healthy, I know.  Anyway, after moving to AZ I was desperate to find a good chicken fried steak.  I found it here!  I'll be honest.  The 5 stars is really just for the chicken fried steak.  I don't care that much for their other steaks.  The service is prompt so I don't mind too much that they don't smile.  Just bring me my chicken fried steak and mashed potatoes and gravy and leave me alone!  

Oh yeah...if you go at lunchtime the chicken fried steak special is only $7."}
{"text":"Yummy yummy yummy I got the chicken fried steak huge portion I had to take half home ...gravy was delicious our watress was very friendly and food was delivered to our table quick ...we got fried macaroni  cheese as an appetizer omg was so delicious ..better than Texas road house or Bobby qs ...def would recommend"}
{"text":"It had character!  The shrimp cocktail was great!  The salad was a simple iceberg with tomatoes and a great tasting dressing.  I got the beef kabob and was disappointed in the beef.  The mashed potatoes were awesome, though!  The waitress was great."}
{"text":"This review is coming from a gal who had never had chicken fried steak until middle age- because to me, it was one of the most unappealing looking cholesterol laden dishes on earth. Well, that changed when dear papa took me there for dinner after picking me up at the airport about 6 years ago. Since then,  I've been to Texaz one or two times a year and....still haven't tried anything except their chicken fried steak combo, always with a Shiner Bock Bohemian Black lager.  It's perfection. Eventually I'll try something else, but why tempt fate?"}
{"text":"To start with, I'm a Texan, born and raised. I've done my share of traveling and I've lived in other places. Being new to the Phoenix area, naturally I'm always looking for comforts that remind me of Texas. I'll often be seen wearing my Longhorns or Astros caps.

I love food! I love Tex-Mex, BBQ and southern style cookin'. So I passed the Texaz Grill several times before I had an opportunity to stop in. The first time I ever stumbled upon it, I got so excited because of the name and the neon signs adorning the windows, Shiner Baby!

When I did stop in, I was in awe, not because it felt like home but because of all the things hanging on the ceiling and the walls and because of the neons inside. Everything in this place has something to do with Texas. Sweet! And they sell Shiner Bock beer!

I knocked off a couple stars because of pricing, variety and the service we got. We were seated promptly but it was pretty much downhill after that. I looked over the menu, which took about a half minute, and was shocked that they didn't even have a hamburger on it. I'd say don't go here unless you're supa dupa hungry because you're going to have to order a steak of some sort or fish or maybe pork chops (I don't remember). I wasn't starving, that's my point. And I'm not even a fan of chicken fried steak but I know a good one when I eat one and it's definitely a true test of a \"Texas\" style restaurant. So I order the chicken fried steak. It was very good, just what you would find at your favorite down home restaurant anywhere in Texas. It came with what they call steak fries, but they were really just big cubes of potatoes. I thought they were kinda weird and bland. You get a large portion of food, very large actually. But it seemed a bit steep, maybe I'm just cheap. Either way, I did enjoy a bottle of Shiner and the place was decent and novel enough that I will go back, if for no other reason than to sit at the bar and have a beverage. Maybe I'll run into some fellow Texans and I can share with them my wonderful experiences in this great city of Phoenix."}
{"text":"Have to agree with Timmy... located just off the 51, it does have a Roadhouse feel to it...  Haven't been there for dinner, but the combination Texas/Arizona (hence the name) cuisine is pretty good fare..."}
{"text":"Old, eclectic, very original! BBQ was great and the prices are very reasonable. It's like going back in time to a place you'd see on the back roads of old America only in Phoenix. The staff is friendly and warm, I will go back again."}
{"text":"When it comes to great food the Texaz Grill is not bested by any place I've ever visited. I'm not sure if you're like me but I have certain dishes at different restaurants and that's what I get every time I go there. But for some reason I've had at least a dozen different meals at the Texaz Grill and each and everyone was great tasting.

Don't expect some stuffy, twitchy server at your table side but you will have what seems like a lifelong friend being attentive. Come casual, loosen your belt (did I mention that most meals portions are quite large) and enjoy your visit to your friend's because that's what it will feel like."}
{"text":"Country fried steak is life!  Ask for extra gravy.  Then bathe in it.  Grab some Lonestars - a Texas delicacy - and watch your troubles disappear.  Also shoutout to the service team - always super friendly."}
{"text":"So it has been a little over a year since I was here last. The place still holds a 5 star review from me. 

I tried the CFS and it WAS good. I never really cares for CFS but figured if I was going to like it I should get it from the best. 

It is a 7inch plus slab of tender beef, lightly battered in a airy type of batter. Think of soda water infused batter. They then slather the middle with a creamy and yummy white gravy. They serve it with mashed and corn with a biscuit on the side. 

The corn was cold, the mashed were OK and the biscuit was just OK. 

The price for lunch was $7.99 of something really reasonable. 

The Chef salad with chicken looked killer."}
{"text":"This place is GREAT!  It is as authentic Texas as you can get.  Great food, great people, great atmosphere.

To non-Texans this is probably just another restaurant with good food and in generous portions.  But to a native Texan, a son of the republic, this is like I've been teleported home for a meal.  We go all the time."}
{"text":"Thank you TexAZ for introducing me to the Steak Lin Su Saturday special!  It's a fantastic steak topped with bernaise sauce, artichokes, and mmmmm shrimp.  YUM!  

Also, thanks for suggesting Tito's Vodka.  Surprisingly smooth and tasty.  I liked it so much, I went & found it at Total Wine & More.  

Fast, friendly service with good food.  Always busy, but you never feel like you wait for too long.  I'll return regularly."}
{"text":"The service was great the plate sizes gets you full plate presentation was very well I  recommend it"}
{"text":"Yeah, I just DONT get it. The service was fine and the prices are very reasonable, but this is in no way a \"good\" meal. It's inexpensive and the portions are mammoth, but that doesn't make a \"good\" chicken fried steak. If you are a quantity over quality person than yes... This is probably your place..."}
{"text":"Bottles of cold Bud. chicken fried steak. merle and waylon and Willie 
on the jukebox. what more do you want?"}
{"text":"TEXAZ is my local steakhouse and I finally got to try it! My brother and I arrived about 7:30p and opted to sit at the bar. The interior is awesome. Just a fun old Texas steakhouse right here in the heart of Uptown Phoenix. All kinds of crazy crap on the walls, great service, and awesome grub.

I get that parking in there is a pain but there are plenty of open spaces across Bethany on the SE corner of the intersection. When you consider how far people walk when they have to park, for example, downtown or at the Biltmore -- TEXAZ is probably actually a shorter walk from your vehicle. Just a point is all.

Anyways, the bartender (whose name I can't recall - shucks) was great. I told her it was my first time and she walked me through the menu and highlighted the chicken fried steak (their specialty) and the prime rib. I ordered the large prime rib and it was excellent. I have also tried the chicken fried steak and, while rich, it's also very good. Just all around, nothing but good things to say about TEXAZ Grill.

Plus you get little glasses for your beer. What a novelty."}
{"text":"Came by with my best friend, I'm a Texan myself and suggested this place due to the name... Well it met my expectations and surpassed them. The owner (I believe) was very friendly and interactive with all guest including our table not to mention the food, it was extremely  delicious and fulfilling!"}
{"text":"It's just a whole chicken breast double dipped in batter and flash fried with mashed potatoes and a shit load of buttery country gravy accompanied by a butter biscuit. 9.50$ 
I'm in heaven. Stomach is full. Glad we came for lunch. Dinner must be huge. 
Fritos pie was real good but not worth 5.50$
Friend had pit shaved sandwich with prime rib with shaved onion and horsey sauce. 9.50. He emptied his plate. 

Happy hour is half off beer, wine, well drinks. (Nothing spectacular. 

But good is the food. Food is real good"}
{"text":"Total dive ..... which is AWESOME!  The chicken fried steak is HUGE, there is no way I could finish it myself.  This place is great in the summer because it's completely blacked out, there are no windows at all.  The walls are plastered with Texas memorabilia from license plates, to shirts, hats, signs, you name it.  The service is quick and friendly."}
{"text":"Best chicken fried chicken with mashed and gravy. Great service. Clean restaurant. Reasonable prices."}
{"text":"Love Texaz Grill. Comfort food. Tonight they have frog legs! Sitting at the bar with Tammy is a hoot! 
."}
{"text":"I've going to this place for years.  Never been disappointed for lunch and never left hungry.  The place kinda looks like a hole in the wall.  And the decor inside is not the best but the quality of food is.  So good looking for some good country food this is the place.  I think truly it's the best chicken fried steak I've ever had."}
{"text":"Hmmmm.... Think I Would Rather Suck Down Your Colonoscopy Bag?

If you are truly looking for a unique dining experience accompanied with old world business cards and lifeless animals, then you will need to try out Texaz Grill all for yourself. If you are looking for good food, solid service, and a nice atmosphere, then you probably want to avoid this strip mall hangout at all costs. If you love low-quality food, poor service, and a revolting atmosphere, then you need to steer your lifted F350 right on over to Texaz Grill.

Wow, from the moment we walked in I knew we were in for trouble ... I just didn't think it could be as bad as it actually was. This is one establishment that will leave you wondering whether the city of Phoenix mandates any sort of cleanliness or health standards. This place is dirty, vile, unkempt, and this is way before we even met our server or received our food.

Just 7:30 PM on a Thursday night, but you would have thought this place was closing up shop for the night or permanently (which wouldn't be a bad thing). Guests are sparse and the few who do remain look like they have chain smoked all of taste buds right out of their mouths. The servers give you the impression they are NOT working for tips and really make no attempt at ensuring a pleasant guest experience. The inside will remind you of a cross between a real, small town BBQ joint and a TGIFridays minus the corporate cleanliness standards. The booths are ancient, uncomfortable, and anything but clean. The walls are littered with business cards, dead animals, used hats, and license plate frames. You will want to write off all the dirt and disaster on the wall as good old Texas charm, but you will quickly realize your appetite fades as each minute passes you by.

So we arrive at our booth and are quickly greeted by our degenerate server who you would have thought was being paid by number of tables she turned over per night. She doesn't look like she wants to be there, and, frankly, neither do we. Our drinks are brought out in a timely fashion, and then she did the best she could to get us to order a quickly as possible. And, we're off....

Orders are put in for a Chicken Fried Steak and the Thursday night BBQ sampler. Our server had to check that there were any of the BBQ samplers left which should tell you that this combination was probably made yesterday and has been hanging around all day. The salad came quick - too quick. Within two minutes of ordering, I had the misfortune of choking down a brown, bland, and boring salad. Of course, nobody goes to a BBQ joint for a salad, but I think most prefer green lettuce and more than two dressing choices.  Not even ten minutes later and our entrees had arrived, and we suddenly had enough food to feed an entire homeless shelter but I have my doubts of them even touching this piss poor attempt at Texas BBQ.

Chicken Fried Steak - imagine about 1oz of beef shankle meat breaded in a pound of breading and smothered in some alien gravy. The meat was bland, veiny, chewy, and not even good enough for my neighbor's dog. You get two of them and each one will be bigger than your head, but I'm not really sure what you are supposed to do with them because they are anything but edible.

BBQ Sampler - I would have rather have sampled what was soaked up in the dirty bar rag or growing out of the rug. The ribs were too fatty and smothered in the generic BBQ sauce that made this place famous. The brisket was boring and overcooked. The Texas fries were not fries, nor were they good. The sausage was edible, but more so in a comparative way. Even the bread was terrible.
 
The food can be summed up as atrocious, inedible, poor quality, and even hard to look at. Truly some of the worst food I have ever eaten or looked at in my entire life. The highlight of the night was easily when our server seemed astonished we refused the to-go box. Sorry, but you should have been shaking our hands for even trying to make a meal out of those make-me-want-to-go-vegetarian plates of meat. 

It is worth mentioning that Texas Grill does two things and two things only correctly. You will be seated quickly to ensure that the dead animals or the plethora of 1970s business cards stapled to the walls don't scare you away and the plastic soft drink mugs are gigantic, but I'm sure this was implemented to minimize server interaction with the tables.

Go grab a McRib or two before you throw away any money at this place...or be ready to pop some serious laxatives. Outside of some rough drinking nights, I have never felt the urge to vomit all over the place 15 hours after a meal. Good luck to you if you choose this place. If you do decide to go, don't forget to bring your business card - it might be old enough to go up on the wall in 2032 - that is, assuming this place is around much longer."}
{"text":"After reading all the reviews on this page I made the decision to have dinner here on Saturday with my husband. We were both very excited, my husband loves chicken fried steak and although money is a little tight we wanted to splurge a little for date night. It was busy but we got seated right away and knew within minutes what we wanted to order. We started off with a bowl of chili to share. The chili was very good, with lots of meat and had great flavor. The side salad that accompanied was fine too. Our server was very friendly and attentive. Now on to the main course, and this is where I have to say we were very disappointed. My husband had the chicken fried steak, and yes it was definitely huge, however there was no flavor to it whatsoever. Even the gravy tasted of flour and not much else. A little seasoning (salt & pepper) would have gone a long way. I had the grilled pork chops and mashed potatoes. The pork chops were a little dry, and again under-seasoned, the mashed potatoes were ok, but I could see what my husband was talking about on the gravy. We so wanted this to be a great experience for us but the food just missed the mark. My husband did want to tell the server about it, but I'm always too self-conscious about making a complaint that I begged him to let it go."}
{"text":"Exactly as expected. I had the country fried steak and I was full within ten bites. Must have been having one of those mornings. 

Not really my thing, but a great experience and a really cool place. I will admit that I ate all the leftovers the same night, and it was still pretty damn good.

Guess Mama didn't make that much Chicken Fried Steak growing up."}
{"text":"Great.  Delicious chicken fried everything.  Great service.  Lunch time is the best deal here, but you'll leave full anytime."}
{"text":"Wow. One of the worst meals I've had in awhile.

My husband and I came here for some Chicken Fried Steak because he went about 3 years ago and said it was awesome. We showed up and knew that we wanted to order the Chicken Fried Steak right away. They took our order, we waited shortly and our salad came out. Wasn't the best salad. Wasn't really fresh..had a lot of ranch on it, but I can see how somebody might like it. Ate some of it and pushed it to the side.

Soon our steak arrived. I was so excited to try it! I took my first bite and was shocked to find that it was completely bland. I added some salt and ate some more. The meat wasn't the best, which I understand because it's chicken fried steak, however it tasted frozen to me. After the 4th bite, I had to ask my husband if it tasted the same as before. He shook his head no and commented on how disguising it was. Even the mashed potatoes were bland. I agreed and started to feel gross thinking about eating any more of it.  

We both pushed out dishes to the side, with lots of food still left on our plate. When our waitress came by about 10 minutes after she dropped the food off, we told her we were done. She asked if we wanted a box, which we declined, but otherwise no questions or concerns - she didn't even seem to notice that we ate almost nothing off of our plates. Didn't feel like bringing it up at the time, so we just paid our $35 for and left. I hate KFC and I would much sooner eat that than eat here again.."}
{"text":"Chicken Fried Steak is amazing.  I'd call it a destination food for TEXAZ.  The larger size does actually have (2) steaks!  If allowed by TEXAZ, enough to share.  Dinner does come with a great salad, bread, and two sides.  Mmmmmm nom.....  I often sit at a table and have a few beers before I eat.  One server in particular seems to put off by a patron have a few brews before dinner.  Outside of the server, I'd give 5 stars.  If you are in town or a local, swing in."}
{"text":"First timers, so on a Friday night we decided to give another non chain restaurant our $$. Texas Grill it was. Upon walking in it kinda has a flea market vibe look. Definitely needs an update to remove clutter that should not be decor.(business cards, hats, etc)  if you can ignore that grungy look... the sevrice was great. Very friendly gal. 

The food was huge portions..i couldnt finish and that doesnt happen often. No draft beers but a good bottle beer selection. Served with a tiny cold glass. We really enjoyed our meals and we will be back again soon to try something else"}
{"text":"Came here with the family not too long ago. The food is pretty good, probably not enough to pick coming here over bobby Q's unless we dont want to make the drive but its good. Service was very friendly and made you feel like you're home which is nice."}
{"text":"This is a really cool place but I really wish they had Lone Star. Love the Bock that's the only thing missing."}
{"text":"This is my go to place for Chicken Fried Steak.  If you're a fan of it, you'll never go anywhere else after you've tried theirs.  IF there is a complaint, there's always too much of it.  LOL  Like that could be a complaint.  Lunch tomorrow!!  Room mate had some fried fish dish (probably cod.  I was too busy with my steak.)  He was raving about that too.  And from what I've heard (I don't like but one of my friends is a connoisseur of it) their liver and onions is out of this world too.  There is a wait time usually if you go during peak hours and peak days but well worth it.  The wait staff is very friendly and personable....and always busy.  They'll always stop by to make sure that you're happy and check if you need a refill.  That's always very much appreciated.   As far as the restaurant goes:  5 of 5.  Now comes the \"lost star\".  Location, location, location.  No parking.  It's in a strip mall with very little parking and there's also a bar in this strip mall and a bunch of other stores.  Anyhow, I'm usually frustrated by the time I get to the front door because it's a struggle to park.  Other than that, you need to go here!!  Great food, great staff!!!!"}
{"text":"This place has been on my bookmark list for a while.  I wanted comfort food last night and Wednesdays the dinner special is liver and onions.  I can make liver and onions just fine at home but then the apartment smells like liver for a week.  Got there about 6:30 and the place was packed.  I had a choice of waiting at the bar or just eating there anyway.  I chose to eat there and I had a good view of the basketball game on the TV so all was good.  For $9.00 I got 3 good sized slices of liver, a bunch of bacon, a mound of onions, mashed potatoes and gravy and a small salad.  For what I paid the food was quite good and plentiful.  The service was excellent.  I still don't care for skins in my potatoes but the option was wedge fries with skins on.  At some point I will come back to try the chicken fried steak.

After several decades of street widening on Bethany Home and 16th st the parking lot is not big vehicle friendly.  The bartender said after the bank closes to the North most folks with trucks park there, including her."}
{"text":"Went here today for my first time ever with my boyfriend....As a native Texan I can't believe I have never been here before. It was like stepping into an East Texas hometown, neighborhood restaurant. The decor had city limit signs, neons, pictures of Willie Nelson and Ronald Reagan. The delightfully tacky interior made me feel like I was home again. 

Well, obviously like every other person that has written a Yelp review on TEXAZ Grill, we ordered the Chicken Fried Steak for our entrees. They first brought out rolls and biscuits. I like that the table has honey, hot sauce, and every other necessary condiment so you don't have to wait to have the server bring it over. We received a small plate of salad. Just enough to satiate the appetite's requirement for lettuce greens and ranch dressing. 

My eyeballs literally popped out of socket when the server brought over our C.F.S. Oh Lawns, the portion was ENORMOUS!!! Like I told the server, everything really is bigger in Texas. The tender cubed steak was battered perfectly and smothered in a nice country gravy. Nonetheless, I decided to douse it in Cholula Sauce to give it a nice little kick. The mashed potatoes were definitely made Southern Style by mixing in the skins. By the time my tummy was ready to explode, I still had a full plate enough to share with two people. I am super surprised how large the portion is compared to the price point. Overall, a great deal and delicious meal. But eat here too often, and you will be contributing to the obesity epidemic in America."}
{"text":"I meet up with my buddy from TX for some home cooking (as he said).  We sat up on the bar.  We were greedy and wanted our own meal.  Portions are HUGE, Texas size!  He got the chicken fried steak.  I got the chicken fried chicken.  It was very good... smothered in gravy kind of good.  WOW!  I did not think I could, but I ate the WHOLE thing.  ALL OF IT!  The service was great.  The only thing sucked is the parking...  I parked across the street and waddled or rolled back to my car after dinner.  Maybe I needed the extra walking steps for the calories I inhaled?"}
{"text":"My Wife and I found ourselves in central phx one evening and she suggested this place.

We stopped in and the entire restaurant was adorned in texas/western themed memorbillia.  It was definitely tacky but not without it's appeal.

Places like this tend to tout their \"Chicken Fried Steak\" Uber Alles

And If I remember correctly the menu claimed \"world famous, or something of that degree\" chicken fried steak

So what was I to do?

Well I ordered that there \"Chicken Fried Steak\" that's what.

I made the mistake of Ordering my salad with \"Mustard Vinaiarette\"
the choices were that and \"Ranch\" I'm convinced they keep a cup of it around to \"prevent profiling\" I don't have anything against ranch, I don't hate america, I just prefer other dressings.

Our food came promptly, and the CFS was HUGE!!!!! (emphasis on HUGE) with a big mountain of mashed potatoes

The Meat was nice and tender and the breading was crispy but airy, I might have finished 40% of my meal at best. overall the food was actually quite good.

At one point the manager came by and checked on us,which is something I always like.

It's definitely the kind of place you'd expect to hear a record skip if you walk in the door impromperly attired, but it has a certain local flare and appeal that would bring me back in."}
{"text":"Looking for a casual restaurant with exceptional food then make your way to TEXAZ Grill. The hardest decision you will have is what to finally order. Everything on this menu is Texas style goodness and is priced right. The chicken fried chicken and chicken fried steak are TEXAZ favorites but you have to try their steaks and if you think you have had great fried shrimp, guess again, this place serves out the best. This may be the only restaurant that I have enjoyed everything on the menu."}
{"text":"Pros:  I think the food is great. It is a very meat and potatoes type spot.  Service is always good to great.  

Cons:  Parking is challenging - There just isn't enough of it.  And the design of that parking lot I will say causes issues.
Decor is old style Texas bbq house type thing. I think it is a bit dated.  But I come to a restaurant to eat and the food is great.  

Come try it - doubt you'll be disappointed."}
{"text":"We  had read some very positive reviews about this place in Yahoo Travel.  What a great place to visit!  The chicken fried steak was huge and delicious! Outrageous portions!  A perfect place to hit after a day of Spring Training baseball."}
{"text":"I kept reading about the chicken fried steak from here in various papers so of course, I had to come in here and order their infamous chicken fried steak. 
All the reviews were true to their word. The chicken fried steak is gigantic in portion smothered in country gravy served with mashed potatoes and corn. And of course, buttery biscuit. 
Well, I don't remember much after ingesting a quarter of the chicken fried steak cause my brain went into a food coma. 
I do remember doggie bagging still enough food for 3 meals, staggering to my car and driving home. 
Where I hope, once home, I took a nap."}
{"text":"Usually a gimmick and not that good but this place is an anomaly. 

I ordered the chicken fried steak sandwich hopping that it was smaller than the chicken fried steak that I saw someone getting as I walked in. I was wrong about that, it had three complete pieces of chicken fried steak on it. It tasted great, I also had mashed potatoes over the fries which I liked the mashed potatoes a lot. 

On the down side. 

Parking! The parking lot sucked, it was extremely small, and my car was hit in the parking lot and no one left a note.

Service, it blew. I was sat in the very back near the restrooms, and the waitress would never get to me. The waitress always took care of the three or four people that were near the front. If the food wasn't as good as it was and the memorabilia wasn't nearly as good they would get a one star from me. I was going to say something to the manager on the way back but didn't have the opportunity. 

Cheers!"}
{"text":"Came here with a friend for a dinner meal. The service was fantastic and the portion sizes were large. Got the prime rib. Have had much better but it was not a bad meal at all. Delicious appetizers. Worth the price."}
{"text":"Chicken fried steak = winner, catfish = winner, anything else I have tried = winner.  Great spot, good portions, and friendly + quick staff.  

Enough said, except a Thank You TEXAZ!"}
{"text":"Without a doubt, one of THE BEST comfort food restaurants in AZ!

Go to items?

1) Chicken fried steak with gravy and mashed potatoes. FORGETTABOUDIT! 
2) Medium rare prime rib and mashed potatoes.  UNREAL!
3) Biscuits and gravy, again, with mashed potatoes! Lol. DELICIOUS!

They have been in the same spot doing their wonderful comfort food CONSISTENTLY for many years now. The atmosphere is kitchy, which I personally don't care for, but I only go for the awesome food and friendly service. Geez, now I'm craving some prime rib!

Don't hesitate to go here for a casual dinner with some of the best Texas comfort food you'll ever have. Bring clients for lunch if they have never been, they will love it and let their guard down so you can have a productive lunch meeting. They will end up going back, bringing their spouses and thanking you for showing them this spot!"}
{"text":"Parking here can be a pain but once you get inside you can have the best Chicken Fried Steak you will ever have. I have driven by this place for years and everyone I have talk to said its great. Not sure why it took me so long to eat here but I will go here every time I'm in the mood for chicken fried steak. The place has a small menu other then that its your average bar. Dart boards, bar, tables, restrooms, but they have freakin UNREAL CHICKEN FRIED STEAK. My girlfriend got the chicken friend chicken and it was good, and it was a huge portion as well but its not as good as the steak. Either one of these dishes can feed two people easily. There was nothing else on the menu I would go back for which is kind of good cause when I go here I already know what I'm getting. They have thousand of business cards that customers have placed all over the walls and celling. Looks cool, but this place could use a dusting! 3 stars but they get a 4th for that Chicken Fried Steak!"}
{"text":"Had a great meal here.  Loved the chicken fried chicken!!  Don't go here if you want fancy food - it is down home style and BE HUNGRY!!"}
{"text":"Stopped in for early dinner. Great special, service and food.  Got the bear battered cod, yummy!"}
{"text":"Awesome place to hang out with family. Their steaks are phenomenal. I especially love their creamy and tasty smash potato. Will be back soon."}
{"text":"Third time's a charm... Got in just as they were about to close and was served the biggest chicken fried steak north of the equator. I'm thinking now I want to move here permanently. There's nothing like a nice home cooked meal right after a long flight. Management and staff deserve all the credit."}
{"text":"My husband and I ate lunch here a couple of weeks ago...I literally think about the chicken fried steak everyday.  First of all, it's HUGE...we're talking hanging off the plate huge.  Second of all, the mashed and gravy--'nuff said!  Third of all, the pecan pie.  My husband ordered it (as much as I wanted to try the peach cobbler, I felt like Violet Beauregarde from Willy Wonka when she ate the gum)...I took one bite (delicious, I might add), and he literally knocked the spoon out of my hand.  I thought he was going to lick the plate clean.  Anyone that gave this place bad reviews obviously is missing some taste buds, and probably thinks the food at TGIFridays is good...I wouldn't take their reviews seriously.

I love this place...not only is the food delicious, but it has a great atmosphere!  Old hats, brochures, business cards, license plates, etc. decorate the place.

Great food, great atmosphere!"}
{"text":"Texaz Grill was recomended to me by a friend and I was not dissappointed!  The atmosphere is that of the late 70's and it looks like nothing has been done to it since.  You get the feeling that you're eating in a roadhouse bar.  The steaks are cooked to order and you won't pay more than $20 for one either.  The portions are so generous I wasn't able to finish my meal."}
{"text":"Easily one of the best Chicken Fried Steaks in the Southwest.

Save yourself a trip to Texas and go to TEXAZ."}
{"text":"Take a little slice of Texas hospitality (and portion size) and drop it onto an unsuspecting corner of Phoenix.  That gives you Texaz.

This place features some of the finest chicken fried steak I've had the pleasure of eating.  It was accompanied by genuine mashed potatoes, buttery corn, and a hearty biscuit.  The portions are as generous as the brim of a texan's hat.

This is also one of the few places you'll find Arizona where you can find Shiner Bock, the finest Texas beer.  If you hurry there now, you can probably still get the Shiner Bohemian Black Lager - a fine tasty beverage.

(They serve beers in a bottle accompanied by a curiously small frosted glass.  If you're not from the southwest, don't be alarmed.  I hear it's \"normal\" in the desert lands.)

All in all, the food was delicious and the owners have instilled a genuine appreciation of the customer that shines through in the service.  This place is about as fine of a casual dining spot as I've found in my travels!

Bring your appreciation for Conway Twitty and a hearty appetite.  Yee-haw!"}
{"text":"From a couple of ladies born and raised in Texas, this place is as close to Texas perfection as ever!  Juicy steaks, melt in your mouth chicken fried steaks and amazing onion rings! The ambience is sooooooo Austin-ish!  Courteous and attentive staff equals 5 stars and definitely a DO-Again!   We'll be back!"}
{"text":"Don't get a cholesterol test the next day cause your doctor will get on you for it being so high.

The only thing that I didn't like is that they have a smoking section and you know what that means... all the smoke floats over to the non smoking section.  The ceiling is low so the circulation isn't very good.

No need to dress up.  Put on your elastic waist pants and go for it!!

The chicken fried chicken is DELISH!!!  And all that gravy and mashed potato!!  Ahhhh!!!!  One meal is enough for 2 people, but me, the greedy porker.... I HAD to get my own.  

The Jack Daniels bread pudding is plate lickin' good!!"}
{"text":"I had a steak sandwich and my husband had the burrito. I decided to get the mash potatoes and mushrooms on the side and they were delicious. The streak was very juicy and tender. I will be back and will probably try the chicken fried steak."}
{"text":"A great experience from the moment we arrived. Our waitress was phenomenal.
The generous helping of fried Cod was fluffy and delicious.
 My only regret was that I had no room for dessert."}
{"text":"Love this place.  Everything on the menu is great.   BUT,  they keep it too cold and windy in there.   The ceiling fans are set for winter instead of summer and you have to dine with cold air blowing on you and your meal.  Not good trying to enjoy the food while being made uncomfortable."}
{"text":"We went on Mother's Day so the place was a bit busy, but the people were very accommodating. When you walk in you think you might be in the wrong place, but once you're seated, it's like you're family. The service was great. Food was delicious and you can't beat the prices."}
{"text":"First, the parking situation here is less than ideal.   This restaurant has a friendly staff and atmosphere that is a refreshing change from the cookie cutter chain restaurants that seem to be everywhere,   Upon entry, I was greeted by the hostess and shown to my table.  The waitress was there to take my drink order in less than 1 minute, however, I was here for the Chicken Fried Steak and ordered it, Mashed Potatoes and a Garden Salad along with my drink.  She brought some rolls, my drink and salad back within 2 or 3 minutes.  The main course, Chicken Fried Steak and Mashed Potatoes arrived a short time later.  I am not a small man, but this plate was packed with food and was too much for me to eat.  Everything tasted pretty good.  Overall, a good experience.  I would definitely eat here again."}
{"text":"Excellent food and very friendly service. Had a prime rib sandwhich that was very tasty and was a large portion. Fun atmosphere as well. I'll be in again... Soon!"}
{"text":"We simply love Texaz Grill, the food is amazing and the service is great! Being a native Texan, I truly appreciate a little touch of home and Texaz Grill always delivers.  Last night I had the fried gulf shrimp and they were yummy! Keep up the great work guys!"}
{"text":"Rib eye steak so good, it felt illegal to use A1 steak sauce.  Mashed potatoes were homemade and gravy was great.  Biscuits are soft, soda glass is big so you don't have to worry about a ton of refills.  Coleslaw was very good too.  Only thing i didn't like was the parking lot.  Very limited and tight so take a cab or small car.  Big pickup trucks will have a hard time in that yard.  But the food was great ill be back."}
{"text":"It's like you stepped out of Arizona and right into Texas. This spot has been in the valley for 30 years and has not wavered. Best chicken fried steak ANYWHERE. And if you want a steak cooked to perfection without an inflated price, look no further. And a cold bottle of Shiner Bock? Yes please. 

There were 6 of us and we sampled the bread pudding, hot fudge sundae, and peach cobbler. Yummy - don't overlook the desserts!"}
{"text":"Texas sized portions cooked to perfection, my only regret is I didn't have room for desert. Best chicken fried steak in Phoenix."}
{"text":"Great comfort food. Highly recommend the chicken fried steak and pecan crusted catfish. Don't miss trying their unique bread pudding. It is the best you will ever eat!"}
{"text":"I finally got the Prime rib that is served only on the weekends. WOW. Now I know why they run out every time early. So tender and flavorful, I mean, the fat was good. Very country with mashed potatoes and gravy but that's good too. I would like to give five stars but the CFS I had the first time was jus OK. You can call ahead and reserve a prime rib if you know your gonna be later as usual. They usually run out by 6pm."}
{"text":"So my wife and I were able to have someone watch the kids and I had movie tickets. so a nice dinner was in order. We were actually driving to the east side of town possibly going to 5n-diner or Islands Restaurant. .love it. BUT we were pleasantly diverted. 

Being such a nice night we had the windows rolled down and were driving by 16th street and Bethany home road. It was like you see in the cartoons when the smell lures Foghorn Leghorn to a freshly baked pie at grannys window. . The aroma had me and I found my self quickly changing plans and following the smell. . I found my self to TexAZ Grill. 

This is a really fun place to go and is very easy going laid back. Again this is one of those places where you can spend hours looking at all the crap on the walls.  .and yes. we found our selves doing just that. 

I looked at the price first when I opened the menu and said do my self. Just about everything is over $12. 

Let me tell you, you get two or three times what you pay for. My wife ordered her all time most popular dish\"chicken frid steak: and I got the chop steak. I uploaded a photo of my wifes dish with her hand over the food just to show you the portion we got. We could have both eaten off her place and been stuffed. The potatoes were to die for. 

I can not think of anything that was bad about the evening. Even the NA beer I had \"O'dules amber\" quite good actually. Once I can afford to go back I am and I'm bringing friends next time."}
{"text":"OMG!!  Went in for a quick dinner, they were so friendly and the service was amazing!!  I had the chicken fried steak!!  Beware it is enormous!!  Definitely had plenty for a second meal!!!  Prices are super reasonable!  Next time I'm in Phoenix I will definitely be back!!!"}
{"text":"Love everyone here! Great food, great people! Grab a drink with a Tammy at the bar! Cheap drinks from 4-6!"}
{"text":"Very friendly staff, Steve has a great sense of humor. Get the chicken fried steak and you'll be in food-coma lol ... Try smaller portion try eggs bubba still super filling. Prices are just right too. LOVE IT!!!!!!"}
{"text":"Still our family choice for birthday celebrations and still 5 stars!   Had another amazing chicken fried steak meal there tonight for 10....finished off with the substantial hot fudge sundae and treated like royalty throughout!"}
{"text":"Best mashed potatoes & gravy I've ever had (sorry, Grandma)! Dive bar atmosphere, great food, great people. The burgers are thick and cooked to perfection. Smaller menu, but it doesn't matter when you taste how well it is executed and you throw in the charm of the atmosphere."}
{"text":"A great neighborhood restaurant and bar, the staff knows its regulars and the service is very good.  

Known for its chicken fried steak, the portions are enormous.  The mashed potatoes and gravy are amazing, great comfort food.  I have yet to have a bad meal there."}
{"text":"the people are great, the vibe is just right and the food is amazing. love this place!"}
{"text":"My first time here. We went for Father's Day. The food was good and plentiful, none of us could  finish our meal! But this place gets 2 stars for the service and experience. I was there for 5 minutes and our server spilled a huge cup of water all over my dress. I was soaked, embarrassed, and cold. An accident, yes, but she's (and I) lucky it was just water. Even more so, lucky I had just put my phone and away and moved my dad's present. My dress would've been ruined. When we told the manager at the end of our meal, she just said \"oh, I'm sorry.\" Really? Just sorry? No compensation? I sat here soaking with wet underwear until I dried and you're sorry? LOL. A GOOD manager would've immediately offered something - anything! On top of that, I think our server was deaf. Seemed to ignore us half the time. Again, food was decent but the manager's reaction sealed the deal on my choice to return. You suck, lady."}
{"text":"Flavorless and greasy. Those two words pretty much sum up my dining experience here. I felt the menu was fairly limited, but hey, I usually ding places for having too many menu items as well. So I went with it under the assumption that a limited menu should mean that every item would be perfected. With that being said, I did notice some type of disclaimer at the bottom of the menu. I wish I would have read it more closely. It mentioned something about that they don't use any seasoning on their meat (wth?). I should have taken this to mean that they don't season any of their food. Also another give away to that fact would be the vast array of condiments available on each and every table. If food is prepared correctly, I shouldn't have to smother it in salt, pepper, hot sauce, steak sauce, worchestershire sauce, or any of the other various condiments offered. 

But anyway, I ordered the Steak Lin Sue which was the special on Saturday night. It's a NY Strip topped with 2 artichoke hearts and 2 jumbo shrimp and covered in bearnaise sauce. It was also served with a salad and mashed potatoes with gravy. The salad consisted of 
wilted iceberg lettuce, a few chopped tomatoes and olives, all smothered in ranch dressing. (They only have two dressings available: ranch or honey mustard, another wth?).  

The menu said I had a \"choice of potato\" but that means either mashed potatoes or french fries (no baked potatoes at a \"steak house\" - yet another wth?) The bread that was brought was a single bland biscuit and a stale wheat dinner roll.  The mashed potatoes and gravy were both very bland and lacking flavor. I had to put hot sauce on them to eat even a few bites. 

The one positive out of the experience was that they seem to cook their steaks well - meaning that the doneness seems to be consistent with what was ordered. So many places do not do this well, and the steak comes out either over or under cooked. This one was a perfect medium-rare and my date's was a perfect medium-well.  Too bad it was un-flavorful (as one would expect when cooked with no seasoning). However, once covered in A1 it was definitely edible and cooked well (just wish they would at least use basic salt/pepper on them). The Bearnaise sauce which my dish was smothered in was way too greasy and sweet (It's not supposed to be sweet.  Why was it so sweet?). I scraped it off as much as possible and ate the artichoke hearts (which unfortunately picked up much of the sweet greasy \"Bearnaise\" flavor) and ate the jumbo shrimp which would have been good if not soaked in the sweet Bearnaise. This dish was $22. I felt it was a bit overpriced compared to the other items on the menu. This should be $20 or under.

Oh, we ordered two beers (they only have bottles apparently) and the waitress brought us the two tiniest glasses you have ever seen. This is not really a complaint, just thought it was amusing as it seemed as if we were having shots of beer. 

I can only imagine that with the food that we received, that the CFS would be equally bland since after all they don't season the meat and the gravy had little flavor. I would not choose to return to this restaurant on my own, but would go as a part of a group who had decided up on it (after I try to talk them into something else, lol)."}
{"text":"This place has been located here for years and kept passing by their sign that said soooo many Chicken Fried Steaks served...naturally that peaked my interest.  So we finally made a point to go and try.  Their special was a BBQ Platter w/various smoked meats that had a sauce on top.  The meat itself was not seasoned a whole lot, for my taste, but the BBQ sauce was ok.  Their sausage was from Southside Market in (Elgin, TX) which was real good.  They also ship so this is a great way to test the sausage before you buy.  We also tried the Chicken Fried Steak, which comes with 2 pieces (1 HUGE piece that almost covered the entire plate and the other piece was 1/2 that size, so still very big).  The gravy they use was seasoned well, but again the Chicken Fried Steak was not seasoned enough for my taste.  The waitress, which I can't remember her name was very nice and attentive, which I like.   The restaurant itself was decorated with a lot of memorabilia, which was kind of cool and more importantly, it was dirty/dusty...so that is a good thing. I would definitely comeback again just to try other things on the menu."}
{"text":"Beefsteak Mexia - so now we have a version of the CFS which is topped with red sauce and longhorn cheese.  And the steak is almost the same size as the plate.  So delicious it can't be put into words.  Now I find myself in a real dilemma . . . which one takes first place as the \"fave\" chicken-fried-object???  Every time I think they've topped themselves here . . . they come up with something new.  Guess I'll just have to keep on coming back!  Thanks to all for continuing the top-notch food and service!!!

PS:  the Pecan Pie slice is now 1/6th of the pie, rather than the 1/8th it was before.  Dear God in Heaven what a delicious dessert!!!  And more of it!!!  Back to the gym I go . . . . :)"}
{"text":"This place was delightful.  Now, not so much. 

All the employees of been there long enough to become jaded and rude. The food is ok but not enough to withstand the hubris if a 3rd rate chic fried steakhouse."}
{"text":"The Hubs and his mom and dad andI all went here on Saturday night. Its walking distance from their house and we go here a few times a year.

I like going on Fridays much better because they have a great fried fish that is only unfortunatly sold on Fridays :( This time around I ordered the chopped steak, it was pretty decent, its loaded with lots of grilled onions. I love the mashed potatos and the side salads come with tons of chopped up green olives, which anything involving green olives gets a plus in my book! 

My mother in law got the catfish, I snuk a bite and it was pretty good. Not fisy at all. The hubs got the tbone. He asked for it medium, but it came out on the very rare side. He ate it anyway and said it was good. 

I love that they have Shiner Bock here. That is up on my list of favorite beers!"}
{"text":"Their chicken fried steak is the best I ever had and the hugest portion I ever had. It hung over the edges of the large plate by 3 inches on each side.
Their prime rib is delicious too. Best is their 1/2 pound dinner cheeseburger which is incredible.
All of their prices are very reasonable and the staff and owner are top notch. 
Not one thing negative to say about this fine restaurant, except that apparently the word has gotten out to the Snowbirds, but they still always manage to seat us right away"}
{"text":"1st timer about a couple weeks ago. Went with a party of 7, which included some real \"Texans.\" :) Had the chef's special, steak and shrimp with artichoke. Great portions! Will take the mashed potatoes over their country potatoes (or Texan potatoes). Great server, great atmosphere. No wait whatsoever on a Friday afternoon. I loved it, can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"Absolutely nothing comes close to the chicken fried steak. But the chicken and dumplings are close. Grab a Shiner Bock and enjoy"}
{"text":"This food is amazing! It's heavy but so delicious! I love chicken fried anything from here. The brisket is also so good. The Gravy is awesome. Most white gravy doesn't have a super strong taste but its definitely not bland like others have said. The best part are the lunch prices! $8 for a huge piece of chicken fried steak, mashed potatoes , corn and a biscuit! They even have lunch prices on Saturday. Yes it's cluttered but I don't rate based on decor unless its dirty which is a different story. It doesn't bother me but like I said I'm not the type of person who lets decor decide if I will return or not. The service varies, sometimes its awesome sometimes it's so so. I've never had bad service here. The only thing I wasn't a fan of was there ribeye because they dot use tenderizers or seasoning which I love but other than that it wasn't bad, I just prefer my steak seasoned and tenderized."}
{"text":"Alright.  I am finally writing a review for TEXAZ.  

One word.  Friggin awesome.  Ok, two words.  I am a huge fan of the smoky prime rib of which I usually get the mulligan (or the American) cut, a 22 oz monster that comes with a killer jus and horseradish.. mmmmmmmmmmmm.  The chicken fried steak is what they are famous for but try the fried chicken.  Super juicy.  Make sure you get there a little early as they tend to run out of the prime rib..."}
{"text":"We had the chicken fried steak. We have enough leftovers for at least one meal maybe two. Service was excellence. We Will probably come back one more time while we are visiting."}
{"text":"This place is all around good , good atmosphere , good service and good food ! Huge portions !! The chicken fried steak is bigger than the plate and then there was a hidden smaller one under it !!! We also had the Big nasty ..mmm mmm good ! Come hungry !! For a little while you feel like your back home in good o'l Texas ..."}
{"text":"Big, BIG portions.

During my visit in Phoenix, my girlfriend and I had our last dinner at TEXAZ Grill. We saw the great reviews and were in the mood for some meat, so this was the choice. Parking is pretty difficult so I'd suggest parking in the big plaza across the street and just walking.

Upon entering, the place is littered with cool memorabilia everywhere. This seems like the spot to go to cause it was packed that night. We were seated pretty fast and ordered the chicken fried steak, fried okra and a NY strip topped w/artichoke and jumbo shrimp.

First off, the portions here are HUGE. You start off with a choice of coleslaw or salad, then came the good stuff. The steak was delicious and the jumbo shrimps topped with some magical sauce were amazing. I'm a pretty big fan of country fried steak, but I was expecting a bit more. Yes, it was about 3/4ths of the plate and had another one underneath, but without it being smothered in gravy, I actually felt like it was pretty bland to eat on its own.

Worth a visit!"}
{"text":"Exceptional service and a fun environment.  Waitress helped make the experience very fun.  Would recommend!"}
{"text":"I think A lot of people get the wrong impression of this place before they even come in, like it's supposed to be some elegant steakhouse or perfect dinner spot. The service was fantastic, We had a party of seven and the wait was not bad. We had plenty of food / bread / salad before our meal. The chicken friend steak was some of the best I've ever had, and the mashed potatoes and gravy all over was excellent. This is not a hit or miss place, the steak was tasty and large. Yes it did need some steak sauce but nothing was incredibly overpriced. I don't see how people payed 25 a person ordering soda, when th fried steak was maybe 13? and the ribeye was maybe 16? Thats a expensive soda for those peeps. I would say it was worth every penny, and also it made great leftovers the next day. This place is genuine, and a good spot to hit up every other month or so. This place (contrary to others beliefs) Is a Diner, and you will notice this on the way in. I suggest you try it yourself, if your not a high roller with perfect expectations on everything, I think you will like this place."}
{"text":"mmmmm ... steak.  Not just steak ... reasonably priced steak, all set in a hillbilly/Texas setting."}
{"text":"Great, great service. Fun Texas decor. Wonderful home cooking. Becoming our favorite neighborhood restaurant."}
{"text":"Ladies and gentlemen let's get our feed bags on the portions are huge here. When you enter the restaurant there is a lot to take in lots of things all over to look at but pretty cool. I ordered the Chicken Fried Steak two fork tender pieces of beef lightly battered fried and topped with  homemade gravy. All entrees served with salad or Cole Slaw homemade mashed potatoes and gravy or texaz fries bread and butter. I would say this meal could feed someone for a week it's a lot of food but really good so if you want a great Chicken Fried Steak it's a must try."}
{"text":"You know that sweet idiom about so-and-so's behind being as large as Texas? Well! They must have had the chicken fried steak. AKA atherosclerosis for your dining pleasure. 

Pretty sure those kitschy armadillos plastering the walls are a fire hazard.

I like it!"}
{"text":"A great local spot since the 7os on the corner Bethany home & 16th TEXAZ is local home cooked comfort food Texas style ! Great Texas Decor reminds me if you were in an old Austin bar. You'd expect to see Willie Nelson hear but if there you'd probably hear him. To begin we had biscuits & honey . Next came large cole slaw and nice dinner salad both very good . We shared the mulligan 16 oz smoked prime rib with large portion of mashed potatoes with the skins & homemade gravy. Also shared a huge chicken fried steak smothered in gravy. Lastly had a brisket sandwich with long strips of the bbq pecan smoked brisket on French roll w real Texas potato home fries. Great service from Josephine , food came amazing fast . I m sure will be back I'd like to try the cod fish & chips. Available on an early bird menu 4-6 with other options . They have a good looking Fourth of July menu too. Great food & Tex az western decor ! We'll be back partner !"}
{"text":"Boyfriend and I were in the hunt for the perfect steak as I am a carnivore, and this place has it! Since finding this gem we have gone back every Friday with no fail! To the point that we made a very special friend named Susan. She is hands down the best server. She knows our orders like the back of her hand which makes our dining experience extra special and convenient. She's very attentive and friendly. We always ask for her! 

As for that steak I was mentioning.. it is to no surprise that it's their smoked prime rib. I've been to plenty and I mean PLENTY of restaurants and none of them can compare to the flavor, the size for the price and the tenderness! The sides are also amazing like their mashed potatoes and the new mac and cheese. Yum!

The boyfriend have always enjoyed their battered cod and Texas fries. 

All in all this restaurant has a nice and friendly vibe from the decors to the servers and of course the superb food. Two thumbs up!"}
{"text":"I'm not one to complain very often about a meal, but this is an exception. I came in to try their Prime Rib but I was told I couldn't order it until 4pm and it was 3:30. Since I was starving, I chose not to wait and ordered their ribeye with mashed potatoes and gravy. It came with a very basic salad which was ok.
When my meal came, I dug into the steak which was cooked correctly but I noticed a lot of oily liquid on the plate. This mystery liquid covered up whatever flavor the steak had. The gravy on the potatoes was strange tasting and I only took a couple bites. 
Any other day I would have sent the meal back, but I was so tired and hungry after coming from the airport that I managed to down most of the steak even though it wasn't at all good. I wasn't going to complain after eating a decent portion of my food. The service was adequate but I can't recommend this place based on my meal."}
{"text":"Stopped in here not knowing what to expect and was pleasantly surprised with the strange decor and all of the hats hanging everywhere. The bartender was very friendly and talkative. Didn't have a chance to try the food (waiting for an Uber to take us to our next location) but our drinks were spot-on."}
{"text":"Being a Texas native, foods like fried catfish, biscuits and gravy, and chicken fried steak all hold a place near and dear in my heart. TEXAZ grill has taken up a permanent residence.

Eclectic decor? Check. Bumper stickers, license plates, University of Texas football team picture from 1986. This place has it all.

Portions large enough to feed Zeus, Mr. T, and a Brontosaurus at the same time? Check. The ribs were probably taken straight from an elephant. The biscuits are about as large as my newborn's head. And the chicken fried steak is enough food for the offensive line of the Dallas Cowboys.

This place is the real deal. A few reviewers have been disappointed by the heaviness of the food. To that small minority, I would say this- you came to the wrong restaurant. It's called TEXAZ Grill. I'm not sure if they know what kale is."}
{"text":"My aunt and uncle live not too far away from this cozy little corner establishment.  The food is classic down home country texas cooking.  I took a friend from San Angelo here and he was so giddy with all the fixings he ordered about 1/2 the menu (6'4 265 lb linebacker).  My favorite is Cx fried anything but have to go with Cx fried steak just to give the arteries a little bit of coating.  The steak was perfectly cooked and perfectly salted...2 points that distinguish good from great cx fried steaks.  The chili is classic and for some reason love it.  The atmosphere is southern hospitality, the location is perfect right off the 51....the parking is not great but park across the street for easier in and out.  If you're wondering whether or not to go here...don't. wonder...just go...you can always do the boring Chili's and Friday's another night....because this place feels much more real."}
{"text":"It's always a good sign when you open a menu and it doesn't require a Cliffs Notes version.  That means what they do, they do really well. This place is no exception. 

The chicken fried steak (the lunch menu version might I add) was very, very generous.  Two out of our party of three ordered that right up. The third was an order of chicken fingers from the kids menu.  The kids menu has a nice selection of choices that are sure to please even the pickiest of palattes (prime rib!), and the chicken fingers were really delicious - tender, juicy and seasoned well.  Though my kiddo preferred ranch dressing, I'd opt for a vat of their gravy if it were up to me!

The chicken fried steak was cooked perfectly.  Anyone who knows anything about chicken fried steak knows there is an art to the fork tender meat and that perfect crust-to-meat ratio.  Well, they nailed it.  Each bite of the \"skin-on little bit lumpy like your momma would make\" mashed potatoes was a heavenly little vehicle for their yummy country gravy.  The corn was corn.  Even the corn knows it's not the star of this dish, so it's there for support.  Biscuits were hot and tasty. Half the  biscuit got some gravy lovin' and the other half, a little kiss of butter and honey.  Blue Bell ice cream cups for the kids were a nice treat.

So the food's great, no lie.  But I'd come back even if it wasn't because the service was stellar: friendly, engaging and welcoming.  Do yourself a favor, especially if you're needing a taste of home, and check this place out."}
{"text":"La décoration de ce lieu est unique, vous êtes directement transporté dans un autre monde en entrant dans cet établissement. Les murs regorgent de stickers et de souvenirs de toute sortes il y a de quoi y passer des heures !! Ce lieu est vraiment unique et vaut le détour ne serait ce que pour ça.

Mais ce n'est pas tout, la nourriture y est aussi très bonne, leurs angus sont énorme, délicieux, cuit juste comme vous le demandez ! Le service est agréables et les pris sont tout à fait abordables, un excellent rapport qualité prix !"}
{"text":"A group of 5 of us arrived for dinner at 6:00. The rude hostess refused to sit us at one of the vacant larger tables and instead crowded us into a 4 top. Needless to say, this was not a good start to the meal. 

We were offered a choice of salad or cole slaw to start with. Unfortunately, 3 of us opted for the cole slaw, which while nice and creamy was loaded with onion and perhaps some garlic. None of us could finish the cole slaw because the onion was so strong. We tried the biscuits, which were undercooked and pastey. One bite was all that anyone could tolerate.

Next we ordered main courses. Two people ordered the Saturday Special steak Lin Sue. A  N.Y. strip steak topped with artichoke hearts, jumbo shrimp and then covered in bearnaise sauce. I don't know who thought this combination up, but neither of the people who ordered it finished it. One of the comments was that the shrimp were well overcooked.

Companion ordered the \"famous\" chicken fried steak because there was no prime rib available. It came smothered in a very thick, heavy gravy that could only be compared to wallpaper paste. They may have served hundreds of thousands of chicken fried steaks, but if they were like this plate I feel sorry for all those who tried to eat it. 

I ordered the pork chops with gravy and mashed potatoes. I was lucky in that the pork chops were nicely cooked - however they were covered in the same \"gravy glop\" that everything else was hidden under. 

Most of our party asked for take home boxes with the idea of feeding the leftovers either to 2 legged or 4 legged members of their household.

Next we ordered dessert. Once again, I picked the winner - peach cobbler topped with vanilla ice cream. Served warm, it was flavorful though the crust was not well cooked. The ice cream was nice.

Another of our party ordered the bread pudding with whisky sauce. The bread pudding was very dense and did not look like any other bread pudding I have ever seen. As we passed it around the table, one of our party got a bite that had raw whisky in it and couldn't stop coughing. 

Another item which was passed around was the \"Old New Orleans Calas\" which were supposed to be sweet rice balls, deep fried and dusted with sugar. Whoever made them forgot to put the sugar on them and totally overcooked them to the point that the rice was crunchy and inedible. They were not deemed to be something that anyone would take home.

On the positive side, our waitress was excellent and a total hoot. She was lots of fun and our tips reflected her good nature.

The restaurant is decorated with all sorts of kitsch, which prevented us from ascertaining the cleanliness or lack thereof of the restaurant.

Our party has requested of me that we not return there again. 2 stars"}
{"text":"So I read about this Texaz place having great Chicken fried steak. My partner loves some of that! I really shouldn't eat it and it's where?
Close to home. How much do we have to pay for it? $7 maybe less.  Really? 

The place does look divey and we might not have tried it without Yelp. Got a parking place right up near the door, sauntered into the Texaz . Noted the armadillos and horned toads scaling the ceiling, the hats, the bric a brac, the country music, the beer signs. More condiments on the table than I'm used to. Lea and Perrins, Heinz 57 Steak Sauce, A-1, Ketchup, mustard, Tabasco, another hot sauce, jar of chili's, Sugar pourer, salt, pepper, and a caddy of pink sugar packets. 

The waitress was right on cue, with menu and kid menu, a cup of crayons and no rush. Drinks came immediately. We ordered some chili frito's (in the bag) a chicken fried chicken, a chicken fried steak and a pork chop all with mashed potatoes, corn and white gravy and totally tasty biscuit.  Frito-bag chili came out first and was yummy, we all shared. Dinner came just as our bag o' chili was gone. It was hot and ready. My partner absolutely loved the gigantic chicken fried steak, my chicken was moist and all white meat juicy. The corn had that roasted buttery flavor I adore. The drinks never languished. The server was always available but never invading our space. Pacing and food and price couldn't be beat. Those were very good mashed potatoes! No one had any leftovers to take home. My daughter even ate almost every bite and she had ordered an adult meal!

It was too late when I noticed the oyster po'boy special... shoot! I'll have to come back. And then I'll have to come back again because with three steak sauce choices maybe I should have bought a steak? There is an ad on the table that they serve the cheapest steak for your money. I have to know if it's tasty and not just cheap.

Couldn't leave without  a dessert. We also couldn't pick between pecan pie and bread pudding so we left it up to our server. She brought us out  a 3 1/2 inch square of very hot sweet, drenched in sauce bread pudding. Very Yummy!

Our bill was light and our tummies were heavy and we left with a five star feeling. However I had to remove a star because an hour after we ate we both suffered some gastric distress and frequent visits to our private bathroom. I still will return, because it can happen anywhere and there was a lot of dairy in that gravy and in the potatoes, so it's partly our fault, but I had to mention it to be fair in the review.

Still...If what you are seeking is down home food, not counting the calories or concerned about the cholesterol, just come on in and eat it up! It's some tasty Texaz.

Update: Went for dinner this time, and the service wasn't near as good, prices were much higher than food value and as such it wasn't worth the bill price. We know now that you should order the specials, those are generally good deals and come at lunch. The mashed potato was still stellar but the gravy was too thick to move. My Prime Rib was +30% fat and that left me with a much smaller portion than I expected. My partners steak DID need the steak sauces, so it's not that they have fabulous NY strip. Docked one star off my original 4 star rating. Come if you want hearty lunch foods though, then it's worth it."}
{"text":"Best chicken fried steak bar none in Phoenix.  I come here only for that but the fresh lemonade rocks here too.  The atmosphere is VERY casual and VERY country.  I cant stand country music but its worth it for this place.  It is also a pretty inexpensive place for a good steak if you are looking.  Service is always good, parking is what really sucks here but if you go when there is not a big rush you will be okay."}
{"text":"Can't believe I never reviewed Texaz. Texaz is a Family favorite since the 90's. Every meal is delicious. Smothered pork chops, chicken fried chicken, chicken fried steak. Even the burger is good. I have never tried their desserts because i'm always full!
Also staff is friendly and on the Ice tea refills!"}
{"text":"Great tasting prime rib!! The rib eye was just as good! The bread pudding with ice cream was excellent!!"}
{"text":"So you're with a bunch of people who like chicken fried steak, and they say, hey theres this steak house you should try with us. This should be your first warning. If a steak house is known for its chicken fried steak, something is not right.

Maybe you're different, maybe you think, sure, they like chicken fried steak, and I like fried asshole. Then this is your place!

Now, you go in, and ahh the ambiance, shit on the walls as far as the eye can see, oh and not just the walls, the ceiling as well! Its jam packed, you can't hear the person in front of you, you're thinking, when's the last time they dusted all this crap? How much falls in my food from the lazy ceiling fans. 

Its hot and a bit humid to, maybe to recreate that true texas experience?

So you order your tbone, medium rare, side of mashed potatoes and hell, some okra while you're at it. Good okra is hard to find in these parts.

The okra, crispy, soft inside (once its done being molten lava), perfect. Don't bother with the sauce unless your garnish for okra is tartar sauce.

Hey, a side salad come with it! Oh, the tiny diced tomatoes, ice burg lettuce, and what an interesting mix, diced green olives all over the top, in giant piles.

Now your entree comes, but the waitress, if you're lucky, has worked there 4 years! Shes got a blond dye job, too much eye makeup, and a perm. She makes sure to leave every single dish on the table, just in case you missed one delicious crumb. At some point she might drop by one basket of rolls, for a table of 8. The buttermilk ones taste homemade, not bad!

Oh yes, the entree, a tbone, super thin, in what is that? Its pooling everywhere, oh god the grease. You did order your steak with a large slathering of grease right? Well those mashed potatoes, which are thick and standard, are drenched in heavy white gravy, and all the blandness of the gravy helps soak up all that grease!

So you're almost done with your food, omg, your giant glass is empty? Where was that waitress? Oh don't worry, just grab her by the arm and she'll try to remember to refill your drink. And those extra plates, well if they're really bothering you you can ask a bus person to take them, though you might as well be asking them to lick your shoe (or eat what you just did). 

Now you're full, you've paid, and because of its \"prime\" location, you get to cross a busy intersection to get to the car you had to park across the street. 

Might as well just wait to get home to pee too, its sweltering in there, more crap on the walls and ceiling, and you pretty much have to stand on the toilet to get the stall door closed."}
{"text":"I am so confused by all of the ratings. I've tried this place twice now hoping that things would be better and that I just ordered the wrong items but I was, yet again, very disappointed. The only thing this place has going for itself is that they have large portions.

As for the food, it should be called Tex\"ass\" Grill!

First time I visited, my boyfriend and I ordered the ribs meal. The ribs were dry and extremely salty. The sides weren't any better either. Their potatoes were bland and coleslaw was over-dressed. 

Seeing the highly rated reviews on their Chicken Fried Steak, I hoped my most recent visit would bring redemption to this restaurant, but, boy was I wrong!

Their Chicken Fried Steak was bland as was their gravy and mashed potatoes! They didn't bother to season the meat and it seems like it was just dredged in season-less flour batter. The gravy was flavorless as well. 

I really wanted to like it but my taste buds fought against me. I felt dirty trying to take another bite because I kept trying to fool myself into thinking I tasted the meat... or the batter... or the gravy... or the potatoes. My last bite of redemption... the biscuit.... which was also flavorless! What happened to buttery, flaky biscuits? They would be well inclined to consult the Pillsbury Dough Boy for some pointers because those taste 100% better.

Disappointment and empty stomachs filled my household for the rest of the evening. At least something was full."}
{"text":"This was a cute Texas looking steakhouse, we were greeted with smiles and hellos! Our waitress was wonderful and humorous. I ordered a CFS(Chicken Fried Steak), which came with mashed potatoes, corn and a biscuit = $10. The CFS was the size of a big plate, definitely worth the $10. The gravy was excellent, and had a butteriness to it. The CFS itself was flavorful and crunchy. The steak was not tough at all, like some CFS can be, just like how I remembered from Texas. Definitely check this place out."}
{"text":"Stopped in with a friend who absolutely loves TEXAS Grill and was only in town for a few days. He ordered the chicken fried steak, I ordered the half portion, and my husband ordered the bbq sampler being featured that night. The portions were huge, I mean HUGE. The half portion was enough for two people to easily share and all entrees were served with either a house salad or cole slaw and a basket of biscuits and rolls to share. The chicken fried steak is served with mashed potatoes and gravy, all a bit under seasoned for me but still enjoyable. My husband's sampler had brisket, ribs, and a sausage. He didn't really care for the brisket or ribs but enjoyed the sausage. The crowd here is on the older side, the decor is a bit over the top, the restaurant itself seems a bit aged but you can tell that there are a lot of regulars that really enjoy coming here. Worth a shot if you are in the mood for some comfort food, and a lot of it!"}
{"text":"Most places I goto that have a smaller menu, I figure that it's due to them keeping it simple and as a result, having really good food. Now I totally missed the disclaimer on them menu saying that they do not season meat, but had I seen that it would of explained alot. 

I got a chicken fried steak with mashed potatoes and a salad with ranch dressing. The salad came out and the iceberg lettuce looked about 4 days  past due to the point where it had started to change colour. The ranch dressing covering the top tasted good but was a bit much.

The chicken fried steak that came next was huge x2, covered in white (un seasoned) gravy with a side of mashed potatoes covered in the same gravy. I feel that when I go out, I should not have to add extra seasoning to my food and having missed the warning, my first bite was not what I was expecting. The other reviews nailed it by saying it was bland, the flour batter on the steak, the steak itself, the white gravy, all very bland. Had I ordered without gravy, I could put some of the 30 condiments that were on the table, on the steak but, alas I thought the gravy would not work with hot sauce.

I'd probably come back and try it again now knowing that the meat isn't seasoned but I wouldn't go out of my way for it."}
{"text":"Texaz Grill is where I go when I want an authentic Texas experience.   It is not fine dining, but it is straight out of a small town Texas Cafe complete with Shiner Bock and Blue Bell Ice cream.  The first time I walked in the door, I knew I was in an authentic Texas restaurant because they had a picture of Hondo Crouch on the wall.   Definitely a spot for Carnivores, any vegetarian will be very underfed (and perhaps alarmed at the conspicuous consumption of meat) It is Chicken Fried steak, mashed potatoes and gravy heaven."}
{"text":"So decided to try Texaz grill since I heard they have the best country fried steak in AZ. They also have good reviews. Go in and it's $16.50 for a fried steak and some mashed potatoes. $15 for catfish. A bit pricey but I press on. Get the food and I'm greeted with quite possibly the saddest plate ever. A small wallop of country gravy for two massive steaks on this tiny plate. It was honestly a little insulting. 

But again I press on. Rear up to cut into this steak that has been so hyped. I raise my fork expected to be raised to heaven and...I'm met with the most tasteless piece of fried food I've ever had in my life. That couldn't be so I try again and again until I finally give. It has absolutely no flavor. Not only that but the breading is very thick and little meat present. Decide to try their Creole seasoning courtesy of zatarans at the table. It helped but not enough to pick the pieces up of my shattered expectations. I've had astronomically better country fried steak at country boys down the street. Even dennys. Mashed potatoes is the same. No flavor. Even the gravy has none. As a Texan I'm appalled honestly that this is considered the best. I push the plate away and prep to bag it up. Maybe my dogs will eat it :-(they didn't).

Move onto the catfish and same thing. No flavor with thick odd breading. Not the usual delicious crisp light cornmeal breading I'm used to in the South but something heavy and bland. No taste at all. Even covering it in spicy cocktail sauce couldn't help. Thinking about it. It didnt seem like any catfish I've ever had. Seemed more like cod. Either way it was awful.

I'm defeated and we leave disappointed. Lol Worst $34 I've spent. Food was just lifeless. Save yourself the anguish and go to country boys on camelback or even Denny's. This is one disappointed Texan."}
{"text":"There's a reason this place has sold over 700,000 chicken fried steaks!  We went here last night and that's exactly what I ordered.  I couldn't believe the amount of food I got once it was there.  The hot gravy on top of it, along with a side of mashed potatoes.  Amazing.  

Before dinner though, they bring out fresh biscuits, which I quickly buttered up and coated with honey.  

This review was based on my own dinner.  The four stars was for the chicken friend steak.  Im being generous because on the downside, the salads we got seem wilted and old.  Our waitress at times was too busy talking to people than checking to see if we were ready to order or go.
My girlfriend got shish kabobs and wasn't too much of a fan.. especially after she tried my CFS.  haha.. My friend got the pork chops and it seemed too much fried food. Weird? 

Overall it was good, but there was room for improvement."}
{"text":"Great roadhouse. Real people, and really good food. Had a honest Ribeye steak. Big flavor, tender and juicy. The price fits the place, food and service, making it great value."}
{"text":"High quality. Good Service. FAST! The menu is limited which makes it a lot easier for the kitchen, I'd imagine. The catfish is just about the best I've ever had. Never disappointed in the service or the food. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"Awesome service, awesome look and feel, and AMAZING food!

Parking sucks, but its worth the struggle!"}
{"text":"For Texas-sized portions at reasonable prices, look no further.  At Texaz Grill, they've perfected the art of breaded, deep fried foods.  I had the fried catfish, and tried the chicken fried steak.  The fried catfish was perfect.  The buttermilk breading was just the right amount of crispiness and had a great flavor to complement the delicate taste of the catfish.  The fish itself, was some of the best I've had.  The meat was very tender and flavorful.

The chicken fried steak was very good, with tender pounded beef and crispy breading.  There were 2 giant pieces on the platter, and it was topped with a generous amount of gravy.  

As for sides, you have your choice of salad or coleslaw, and mashed potatoes or Texas fries.  I had some salad, which wasn't too impressive since it tasted like someone had made it way in advance, making it taste soggy and wilted.  The coleslaw was decent, in a mayo-based sauce that was tangy and sweet.  The mashed potatoes were a hearty portion of skin-on mash.  

Service was friendly and drinks were refilled as needed.  Parking, on the other hand, is a nightmare if you come at a busy time.  Prices for dinner range from the teens to the low 20s, depending on what item you get.  

So, I'd probably be interested in going here again next time I'm in the mood for some fried food, but only if it's at a less busy time where parking won't be as much of a hassle."}
{"text":"Good go to standard chain food but good. Great drinks. Great people Tuesday best day. I only give 3 cause it's a chain but hood people I can't sat for every restaurant."}
{"text":"Loved the place and service was quick and nice. Short and sweet menu, and best chicken fried chicken, loved the gravy with chicken base. Soft and fluffy biscuits and sweetest corn."}
{"text":"My first time there. Very disappointed. Chicken fried steak served on an oval plate way too small which prevented any sizable portion of mashed potatoes and corn. Ordered the chili on top of the chicken fried steak. First the biscuit was just a little bigger than a silver dollar. The breading on the chicken fried steak would not stay on the one quarter inch or less thickness of the crushed steak. The steak was way oversized and came dripping with grease from the kitchen dripping on my clothes. I got it with chili on top probably got 3 heaping tablespoons of chili at a price of 2.50. The chicken fried. steak was barely palatable- - - after the breading sluffed off of the steak. Never was asked if i Wanted a refill on my tea. My friends was the same way. Host came by to check did not have the nerve to tell him how repulsive it was- - that was my fault."}
{"text":"\"Incredible\"

\"Magnificent\"

\"The best chicken fried steak on this side of the world\"

-Me, after my first, second, and third bite at this heavenly restaurant. 

First, you walk in and there is not an inch of paint you can see on the walls -- they are completely covered with miscellaneous items such as license plates and deer heads. Awesome, simply the perfect atmosphere to get in the mood to eat fried food. 

We were greeted by two very friendly people who sat us quickly. They were extremely attentive and quick to get our orders in. Obviously, I ordered the chicken fried steak, and obviously, you will also order the chicken fried steak. 

We were served coleslaw and a biscuit while we waited in anticipation for what was to come. I took small bites of both, trying to save room for my feast, but couldn't help but gobble down the biscuit which was a flakey and buttery. I'm not a fan of coleslaw, so I can't really comment on that, but it looked very creamy, if that's how coleslaw is supposed to look. 

The chicken fried steak. wow. First, you get not one, but TWO giant pieces of meat covered in gravy with a side of potatoes (I chose mashed). It was absolutely fantastic. Crispy on the outside, juicy on the inside, and the gravy was topped perfectly. The mashed potatoes were great, but I pushed them aside so I could shove my face in the steak.

They packaged our chicken fried steak for us to go with an extra side of gravy at no charge (bless them), as there was no way we were going to finish it all. 

One of the wonderful people who worked there (who I believe was the manager) overheard it was my birthday and did not let me leave without giving me a scoop of ice cream and announcing to the restaurant it was my birthday. Seriously, they are too friendly.


TLDR: eat here if you want to experience what heaven is like."}
{"text":"Everything I had was on the bland side of mediocre.  I might be too picky, but the Midwestern crowd seems to be in love with everything.  Maybe it was an 'Off Night' for the place.  Waiter was adequate in service and came through like a champ when I asked to have the Chicken Fried Steak removed from my bill.  The beef was tender. The batter was fried perfectly.  IF they woulda thrown some Salt/Pepper/Garlic/Lee & Perrins/etc./etc. in the hamburger and in batter, well, I tell you what, I would've eaten a whole lot more of that big CFS!  But lack of any flavour made me stop at maybe 20%.  I'm certain that the MN IA WI IL ND SD etc. natives will love it.  I will not be back."}
{"text":"The food was awesome I had the chicken fried steak and would not believe the size of the steak but was more surprise that there was another one same size under that one great taste great margaritas highly recommend this location great food excellent service and awesome attention by the person that was in charge as well"}
{"text":"This place is a really good slice of Texan food. Been here three times and each time the main course has been delicious.  First time I had the smoked prime rib, better than most expensive steakhouses. Second time was a Monday (check there Website for each days special) and fried chicken was half a bird...extra crispy goodness. Today the special was bbq beef back ribs. Five Flintstone sized ribs on the plate. Waitresses are all super helpful and know how to serve. My only downside is the potato choices. Not a big potato fan the Texas fries are big chunks and the mashed are really dense. Good country gravy though. Might try potato salad next time. Have my eyes on the big bubby enchilada next."}
{"text":"Their chicken fried steak and gravy is worth 5 stars alone. Owner came by to greet us personally nice guy friendly staff and very attentive"}
{"text":"The lunch portion was excellent. The food is delicious.  The decor is old Route 66ish. The staff are friendly and obviously like their jobs. Nice old home cooked food. Comfort food that competes with your Grandma's."}
{"text":"Been here before but never got the 
CFS it was the best I ever can remember
Enjoying and for 12.95 it's huge they give you 2 steaks.. The cole slaw if flipping great
Will be my go to spot for years to come .."}
{"text":"Being a Texas Native and foodie. This place is legit. Being my first time here thanks to a Yelp search for chicken fried steak this was on top of the list, I had to check it out. Seeing the decor on the wall I had to make a Texas License Plate donation because after two years of being here I finally caved in and registered my car in AZ and coincidentally had it in my trunk. This donation yielded the opportunity to meet Steve the owner. Steve was awesome we chatted about Tex-Mex food and life in Texas. It was delightful meeting him. 

Now on to the food. We ordered a dish on their daily special of biscuits topped with a chicken fried steak topped with eggs. This may sound weird but that's how you eat them in Texas. Food was killer. Steve was also generous in bringing us a sample of his BBQ brisket and mash potatoes. Again legit Texas style food. As BBQ competition person whose tasted some of the best BBQ in Texas I have to give two thumbs up, all the food had great flavor. And we even tried the cobbler topped with Bluebell ice cream. Which if it had anything other than Bluebell than that would be a sin. 

We will be back to try other menu items and next time go with a bigger appetite."}
{"text":"Let me start this review by saying that I am a huge fan of TEXAZ Grill.  I have been enjoying their CFS since they were Lone Star (over 20 years).  

My wife and I stopped in this past Saturday (03/22/2014) for an early lunch.  We were immediately \"greeted and seated\".

Our server came by for our drink order and I also ordered a cup of the \"Sopa de Fidello\" (my main reason for this visit).  The soup came and was very, very good.   I normally get a cup of their wonderful chili, but I really wanted to try this soup after reading the description on line.  I wasn't disappointed in the least.  Chunks of ham, vegetables, and the video noodles; all in a spicy, savory broth.  I would love a big bowl of this soup and some wonderful chewy, crusty bread on a cold winters night (yes, I know I'm in Phoenix, but I can dream...).

Both my wife and I had a salad w/ the house dressing and the lunch sized Chicken Fried Steak.  I love the house dressing at TEXAZ.  My wife (a former ranch dressing girl) now orders the house dressing, it's so good. The salad is evenly coated w/ dressing, and there is never a glob of it on the plate when you're done.

What can I say about the CFS, that hasn't been said many times before...it was perfect as usual.  The CFS came w/ mashed potatoes, corn, and a biscuit.  The steaks were hanging over the sides of the plate.  Fresh, hot and perfectly seasoned.  I have tried this dish at other restaurants, only to be disappointed w/ the food. 

I didn't get the name of our server, but she was great.  She came and checked on us regularly and was pleasant and quick w/ the tea refills.

Yet another great meal at one of my favorite restaurants...

I think there are many restaurants here in the valley that could learn something from TEXAZ and their longevity here in a place known for \"here today and gone tomorrow\".
Quality and consistency.  Start w/ quality ingredients and quality people; and keep it consistent."}
{"text":"The BEST steakhouse in all of Phoenix. Their filet is fantabulous!! Our family's been going here for years. We've never had any regrets or any complaints. Most of us get the filet or the chicken fried steak with extra gravy. mmmmmmm!"}
{"text":"Really nice people.  Very welcoming to kids. Owner came out and ask kids riddles and did Texas Trivia.  Really fun.  The Ribeye I had was average..."}
{"text":"Meh. Alright. Nothing to brag about. Ok, Ok they have Titos vodka, big score. The portions are humongous, I ordered the chicken fried steak and it literally could have fed 4 girls. The batter and gravy were both pretty bland, what's all the rave about this place? 

My bf got the Ribs, and they were just ok, very fullof fat pieces, they had a smoky sauce where I normally prefer a sweeter, tangier bbq. It almost seemed like they try to make up for the lack of flavor with huge servings. 

The inside of the place looks like a dumpster monster from Texas puked all over it. Crap everywhere and not very clean. Yea it is cheap, but you get what you pay for."}
{"text":"I would literally rather eat garbage out of a dumpster than come within fifty yards of this truck stop.. I mean.. \"restaurant\" again. It would probably be easier to force down. Also, our server looked like she couldn't stand another second living her life there. The 10 cent jalapeños are not worth 1 cent, and they're served in a coffee mug? The French fries are undercooked, chopped potatoes (but don't ask about them or you'll get a slap on the shoulder by the waitress like my brother in law). The olives in the \"salad\" that they offer, I promise you, looked exactly like someone chewed them up and spit them on some old iceberg lettuce. The best part about this place is that they have beer to wash down the tasteless food. I wish I could get my father in law his $250 back and leave no stars. Pathetic."}
{"text":"The portions are huge.  The food is delicious. Worth every penny eating here. The sauce on the chicken fried steak is the best i've ever had! The fried okra was sooo yummy!! The staff was super friendly. The decor is very cute and rustic.  We loved every part of this place.  You will definitely not leave here hungry!!!"}
{"text":"great food and service. i got the mulligan - super delicious cooked medium. Ate the whole thing. 28 bucks. great price."}
{"text":"Really good prime rib. Tasty and tender. Cooked to perfection! Loved the smoked flavor. They cook it over pecan wood and add smoky ah jus. Very reasonably priced the mulligan cut is 16 ounce. And it was available at 9 pm"}
{"text":"I just don't get it.  this place is like a homeless shelter but with even worse food.   I know it's southern style....but EVERYTHING is double fried...and you walk out of their feeling like death.

It's expensive ($25 pp with soda) and just not quality food.

this is worth a big SKIP...."}
{"text":"The owner is a total jerk0ff.  I have been in there so many times.  Each time he never comes by to ask how my meal was, yet he goes to other tables.  I am always in a suit so maybe he just doesnt like well dressed people (if you have seen the decor inside, you know what I mean).  It's dingy.  The food is ok---but the owner being a tool and not asking how everything was even once in 8 recent trips made me decide I will never come back ever. he is an idiot."}
{"text":"What a great find.  I now know what chopped steak should taste like. I did have to embrace that it was ok to be a little greasy. Once I did, there was no holding me back!  I added sautéed mushrooms to it.  Yum! The mashed potatoes were also delightful.  Great flavor.  Our service was fantastic.  Everyone was very friendly and personable. Thank you Texaz Grill!"}
{"text":"I was told about this place as soon as I came to town from GA two years ago. Kicking myself for waiting so long to visit. Great chicken fried steak and viddles! Come and get it! Don't forget to ask about the \"clean plate club\"."}
{"text":"First time here! Recently over in the area and always see this place super pack. Decided to give it a try. Their service is excellent our waitress was really friendly and sweet! I was surprised to see that the owner was there too socializing. He is very down to earth and shows how much he cares about his business! By the way I'm part of the CLEAN PLATE CLUB SCOORREEE! Lol highly recommend this place for some good ol southern food!"}
{"text":"Great food and service here but parking is a bit of a pain. Hubby got the chicken fried steak, he said it was quit possibly the best he ever had. I got the chili, it was delicious even though no beans are added. I also got their coleslaw, that was delicious too. It was a bit noisy here not sure if it always is this way but the food was worth it. Our waitress Helen was the bomb! She has it going on, I would highly recommend sitting in her section!!"}
{"text":"as much as it pains me, just 3 stars which is a gain from my previous 2 but lacking from my original 5. My favorite day is Wednesday as liver, bacon and onions are on the menu. What happened, liver overcooked and gristly, bacon overdone crispy but the onions nice. I did not order onions, but did liver. I wanted to let my server know but she was busy and distracted with other problems, next time. I am a big fan of Texaz Grill for years but my yelp reviews are my honest opinion of my meals served. I do hope Steve and his staff can step it up before the dinosaur syndrome sets in."}
{"text":"This time Yelp failed us. This place is overrated and overpriced. I don't know what to say, I'm shocked at the quality of food that was served to us. I had the brisket sandwich and was disappointment by how bland it was. The salad was not much better, it had to many olives. I had to send it back. For the price, I expected a whole lot more. What can I say. I won't be back there again."}
{"text":"the food was good here, i had the chicken fired steak, and it was decent. the only issue i had was, it's a little to dark in there for me. But other then that, the meal i had was good. i will go back and try out other options."}
{"text":"Great service, very friendly.  Went for lunch, I had the chicken fried sandwich, the chicken breast was huge, I think they pound them flat, anyway it was moist and delicious.  Fries were good too, they're big chunks.  My hubby had the chicken fried chicken, he said the gravy was great, definitely home made gravy.  Our food came quickly, and was super hot which I dig.  $22 for two lunches and drinks.  We will definitely go back I would like to try more of their menu."}
{"text":"Reading the reviews I was expecting some good food. 
It wasnt even close to what I got. In fact Im not completely sure what I got. I had ordered their ribeye cooked medium.
Let me just say for a ribeye I am expecting a tender juicy steak. The ratio between meat and fat was terrible. I had more fat than I did meat and the meat that I did have was chewy like leather. My friend had the brisket sandwhich which was ridiculously bland. Salt and pepper didnt even help. The salads we both got were questionable and had a weird taste that I couldnt put my finger on.

The service was friendly and personable. But when something wasnt correct they did little to nothing to fix it. The server acknowledged  that the salads were not the best but didnt offer to exchange it for anything else. She had also acknowledged that the meat was tough and chewy when she saw me struggling, but still didnt offer to exchange it out. It was very disappointing, especially when you're a steak lover like me. I dont think ill be back sadly."}
{"text":"This place is heaven for chicken steak lovers. I especially enjoyed the buttermilk biscuits and the fine selection of drinks, I will return most definitely."}
{"text":"Great food and great service every time! Excellent specials huge and fantastic Chicken Fried Steak! I also love their fried okra! Yum!"}
{"text":"TexAz is a one of a kind Phoenix gem. 

Great food and great service...we had chicken fried steak and chicken fried chicken, and both were deliciously smothered in white gravy. Perfect mashies, a large salad and mound of cole slaw plus biscuits rounded out a great Sunday dinner. Oh, and in honor of Valentine's day, we got a free piece of yummy chocolate sheet cake to split. And if you are not in a chicken fried mood, try the equally magnificent fish fry!!!"}
{"text":"As a Texas native I was excited to see TexasAZ when we first relocated to Phoenix but my excitement quickly faded after a couple of visits. On half of our visits the servers were inconsiderate and bordered on rude.  For example, my father in-law didn't like the canned, tin-tasting corn and asked about substituting fried okra (which appears premade and frozen since many pieces are attached to one another in gobs of 3-4 pieces) and our waitress said \"no, we don't substitute okra\". This is fine but she didn't offer to substitute anything else.  It wasn't until three orders later and another substitution was tried that was acceptable.  Why in the world wouldn't she just have said we cant sub okra but would you like some cole slaw? Since things seem relatively consistent over four visits today was my last. This Texan was immensely disappointed. To its credit the portions are generous and the restaurant does seem to support the community.
If you are like me and want some GREAT southern cooking with GREAT southern hospitality take a drive to Avondale and visit the Fry Guy (I am ONLY a very satisfied customer with no affiliation trying to help others that enjoy consistently great food and friendly service)."}
{"text":"I know that this place is a Phoenix staple, but just because something is really old doesn't mean its always good. 

TexAz Grill is very mediocre. 

The building is cool, lots of old stuff all over, almost feels a little cramped, but for an old spot, that's to be expected. The menu is very small, Chicken Fried Chicken, Chicken Fried Steak, T-bone, and sometimes ribs on special. Everything we had was yummy, however the coleslaw was a bit on the soggy side for me. The ribs were smoked to perfection, fell right off the bone, and the chicken friend chicken was great. Service was exactly as you would expect it to be, nothing to write home about. But we had everything we needed. 

Check it out if your in the mood for some home cookin, but don't be expecting to get blown away."}
{"text":"I agree with Pauly C. I disagree with his review being GTL. I am also from Texas, the meat beneath the breading in the chicken fried steak was absolutely atrocious, the gravy was decent but not the best I have had. The bread was deplorable, I've had better day old bread from fry's. The bbq sauce tasted worse than krafts original, and this is supposed to be a homeage to Texas BBQ and food. I would never go there again even if I was starving and paid to eat there. For real bbq visit Bobby Qs on 27th ave and northern, I have yet to find a decent chicken fried steak in Phoenix."}
{"text":"After all our friends had told us to try out Texaz, we finally did. We both ordered, and it wasn't bad! What they forgot to mention to us was that they all had the chicken fried steaks and LOVED them. Guess we'll have to get that next time. Very friendly staff."}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite lunch spots in Phoenix. It's a locals only kind of joint, where the walls are covered with Texas signs, license plates, etc and the ceiling is covered with business cards and baseball hats. The booths are deep and cushy, and let you settle in and get comfortable. Or, if you are dining alone, you might choose to sit at the bar, especially when they are crowded at lunch.

My favorite lunch is the grilled chicken sandwich, only available at lunch, which comes with onion, lettuce, tomato, and pickle on the side. Try the dirty mashed potatoes with gravy for a real home cooked meal feeling. If you order a side salad, they come with sliced olives!

For dessert, I recommend the home made pecan pie with a scoop of Blue Bird vanilla ice cream on the top.

The price is good, the food is good, and the service is always great and with a smile."}
{"text":"I've always loved this place. Texas food is always good. I enjoy this place but just can't come here to often. TEXAZ is an unassuming place on the outside and settled in a very tight corner of the shopping center. Like I said very unassuming. Once you walk in then BOOM. It's like a time warp taking you back to Texas in the 1970's. Place is decorated with old pictures related to Texas, road signs, animal heads, caps, and old license places. Very interesting and very loud. Everyone talking, eating, and having a good time. 

We started out with our usual fries okra. This is the only place I can find fried okra in AZ. Nice change of pace. Love the okra. Nice and crisp. Love it. So I ordered their famous Chicken Fried Steak. They say it's the best in AZ and I can't disagree. All meals comes with a side salad. Salad doesn't look that appetizing but it's not bad. House dressing is pretty good. Anyways, the CFS comes with two huge pieces hanging off the plate smothered with gravy and comes with mash potatoes. Very crispy and fresh. Not greasy at all. Really good. Best in AZ hands down. Only problem is that it's too much food. I couldn't even come close to to finishing it. I saw two guys at a table across from us share an order of CFS. Very smart and would probably recommend sharing this huge meal. My wife ordered the Fried Catfish. Two large pieces of fish with a side of mash potatoes. Wife loved it. Not greasy at all. Fresh and moist but again a lot of food. So good. Everyone's ordering the CFS and fried catfish. There's a reason. 

My son ordered the prime rib regular cut. Really big piece of meat with a side of mash potatoes. My son really liked the prime rib. He's a fussy eater and he really like the prime rib. So when he likes it then I know it's really good. Looked juicy and fresh. 

We were stuffed with all this food. Packed up our leftovers but you can't leave this place without dessert. We shared the pecan pie. Oh my gosh. Your probably laughing right now but this is the best pecan pie. Had pecan pie from Texas and all over and this is the best I've had. It had a hard topping that most pecan pies don't have. A little chewy and not as sweet as most pecan pie. Crust is outstanding. Hands down yummy. 

So the food was really really good. The service was also outstanding. Once we sat down our server was there for our drink orders. Food was brought to our table really fast and they cleaned off our dirty dishes very quickly. We also had our server and owner check on us to make sure everything is okay. Everyone makes you feel at home just like in Texas. 

So good food (aka little too much), good service, and good dessert. Enjoy and bring a wheel barrow to roll you out. It's that good."}
{"text":"For a genuine steak place that has good food and isn't fancy - this is the place. The food is straight forward and tasty. Biscuits are delicious, steaks are made by someone who loves meat, in a good way! And the place is full of regulars - that is obvious. Highly recommended for the unpretentious crowds."}
{"text":"I saw so many great reviews from this place so we decided to try it. I had very high hopes. I loved the atmosphere and the kids loved the Texas trivia game, but that's about the only good thing I could say. My steak came out and was not cooked the way I asked. They took it back to fix it. The steak had no flavor and was just covered in butter. I thought it was just my steak, but even the kids didn't eat there's.  The waitress asked my daughter of something was wrong since she only ate a few bites so I explained she didn't like it. She just said ok and walked away. The shrimp was good, but pricey. The bugers were just ok. At the end they were pushing for us to take it home since we ate almost none of it. We politely declined and she still came out with boxes trying to get us to take it. The chicken fried chicken that my daughter's friend ordered  was another item thatcwas horrible.  The gravy had no flavor and when I tasted it the piece I had was so fatty. I pulled the skin out of it and it didn't even look fully cooked. Maybe we were there on an off night, who knows, but for me it was very pricey for the quality of food we recieved.  Nothing had flavor so I guess that's why all the sauces and spices are in the table."}
{"text":"Had the Chicken Fried Steak... Oh man talk about Yum!   This place does it right,  fast friendly service,  reasonable prices.. They have all the bases coveted and they been doing it a long  time.   It's difficult to please this critic but they did."}
{"text":"Huge portions (always a plus) and pretty good food.  Definitely worth the trip considering the lack of 3+ star restaurants in the Valley."}
{"text":"The only reason I am giving this place a 3 star review is because the service was excellent. The waitress was very friendly and gave us the perfect mix of attention and privacy. We were seated quickly, and had drinks a few minutes later. The food arrived equally fast.

The restaurant itself is your typical roadhouse. Its dark and a bit crowded feeling inside, with lots of stuff on the walls, and feels dirty, even though I'm sure it's clean. Prices were reasonable, especially considering the huge portions of food. I ordered their \"famous\" Chicken fried steak. I'm not entirely sure what I was expecting, but what I got was not what I was hoping for. the breading on the chicken wasn't very crispy and had very little flavor. The gravy had even less flavor than the batter and only succeeded in making everything soggy. The steak itself was cooked well but fatty, flavorless, and hard to cut. the salads and side dishes were equally mediocre. 

Nothing special about TexAZ Grill."}
{"text":"I've wanted to visit Texaz Grill for months, and after showing my husband the Check Please, Arizona episode, he was gung ho to go, too. 

The parking is a big pain. We were lucky enough to get a spot in the back after a minute's wait (otherwise it would have been very hard to get out of there). But once we were inside, the food was exactly as promised. We started with a side of fried okra. Yum. Awesome breading, everything fresh and hot.

My husband ordered the lunch version of chicken-fried steak. He was in heaven. I tried a small bite. I'm not usually a fan of chicken fried steak, but it was fabulous.

My options were a little limited because I can't do really heavy fried stuff. I had the Dallas Tacos. They were good. Nothing spectacular but still satisfying. Let's face it--no one is coming here for tacos! Check out the Yelp photo gallery to see my plate.

I usually don't do dessert out, but bread pudding is my Kryptonite. Too many people on Yelp praised this dessert dish, and with reason. My word. The bread pudding was sweet, firm, and delicious. We ordered it with the scoop of ice cream, which ended up being HUGE. Texas-sized. The whiskey sauce on top is luscious.

In the rare event that we're back in this part of Phoenix, we will definitely stop here. For the sake of our waistlines, it's probably a good thing it isn't closer..."}
{"text":"Nope, nope, nope.

I came here on the recommendation of other fellow Yelpers and I am so disappointed.

Firstly, parking is a mess.  Next, I came with my husband and two year old daughter and the hostess told me that they don't have a high chair that can accommodate a two year old so she had to use a booster seat.  The problem is that she's at that middle age where she's almost done with high chairs and still too immature for a booster seat.  What a mess trying to keep her in her booster seat and contained.  She wasn't noisy or badly behaved, per se, she just wanted to stand up in the booth and look around and fidget with all the condiment bottles on the table.  Also, can I mention that the booths have a weird half wall that obscures the other diners from the chest up, but is open from the chest level down, so someone in the other booth could easily reach underneath the wall and dig around in your purse if they wanted to, or your two year old can peek underneath the booth wall to play peek-a-boo with the diners on the other side?  It's pretty weird.

So the waitress came over took our drink orders with a minimum of small talk (or overall friendliness).  We perused the menus.  My husband chose a beef brisket sandwich.  I wanted a t-bone steak, I had been craving one and I was looking forward to it.  We ordered our dinners and it's worth mentioning that at NO point did the waitress acknowledge that presence of our daughter.  She never asked us what she wanted to eat or if she needed anything to drink either, apparently she was invisible.  Seeing as how there weren't any kids meals on the menu, I just assumed we'd feed her from our own plates, but interestingly the waitress just assumed that too because she didn't even ask if she'd be having a side order of something as her meal,  She just looked right past her.  If I sound pissed it's because I was.  I don't need the waitress to pinch her cheeks and make baby talk with her, but to merely acknowledge the fact that there were three human beings sitting at the booth that night would have been covered in 'Basic Manners 101'.

So my steak was very flavorful and tender but BADLY undercooked, terribly fatty and a sickly color gray.  (It didn't have a nice sear or a good caramel color to it.)  I ordered it medium rare, but instead I got bloody, almost blue meat.  And there was so much fat that I only got about half meat, the rest was all scrap fat and the bone.  My sides were non-descript.  I think my mashed potatoes were probably decent, I honestly can't even remember that's how non-descript they were.  The roll and bread 'basket' that came with my food (one little roll and one little cold biscuit) were hard and tasted store bought.  And my hungry toddler didn't even want them.  My husband's beef brisket sandwich was a pathetic, dried out, flavorless waste of good money.  We didn't even bother with desserts.

I had a margarita; it was very good, but beguilingly strong for how petite the rock glass is that it was served in.  After I finished it the waitress came around and asked me if I wanted another and I declined, but my husband (a non-drinker) immediately piped up and said \"Yes, she'll have another!\" and shot me a playful look, and rather than looking to me so see if I *really* wanted another $7 margarita or not she simply walked away and had the bartender make me another one!  WTF?  So within a couple of minutes I had yet another very, very strong margarita sitting in front of me.  Now I'm no cheapskate but I don't like to waste money so I choked down that second margarita and it was the proverbial 'straw that broke the camel's back'.  I may have finished it, but it definitely finished ME.  I spent the rest of the night stumbling and mumbling to myself about someone slipping me a mickey.  I've never, ever had a margarita that strong and I am a very well seasoned drinker.   What of Earth did they put in them??

So to sum it up I spent over $60 (includes the tip) for 2 small Molotov cocktails disguised as margaritas, an undercooked, fatty, t-bone steak, an inedible, dry beef brisket sandwich and a big serving of NOTHING for my child.  

Never again.

The two stars are for the flavor and tenderness of the otherwise failure of a steak and the extreme value for your money on the alcohol.  THAT'S IT."}
{"text":"surprising when you walk in and have no idea what to expect.  
very kitschy old and probably not too clean.
rustic, dark, woody.
waitresses probably been there 30 years.  all very nice and warm and friendly.
definitely not up to code on service, as she took our drink cups back for refills on a tray with someone else's dirty plates.  also put them on someone's else's table while dropping their check.  Ewww!!
lots of noise.
plenty of seniors.
very busy, sometimes a lineup.
not cheap for what it is.
HUGE portions.
simple home cooking.
simple menu.
very limited.
salad or cole slaw with meal.  neither is particularly good.  2 dressing choices.  take it or leave it.
i had the chicken fried steak.  their specialty item.  it was huge and hanging off the plate.  creamy gravy not too bad, tho it is not something i am used to eating.  meat itself was average in my opinion.  side of mashed potatoes and my daughter's home fries were also quite average and bland.  
definitely worth 1 visit, something to see and experience, tho unsure you would return for the food alone.  that would be a personal decision, obviously many do."}
{"text":"Only been there once as we were in the area for an appointment at Shasta pools. The chicken fried steak was large & delicious. The atmosphere is nice and inviting, so is the staff. No reason to be giving them less than 5 stars. Try it, you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Great gravy! Let's just start with that. The chicken fried chicken and the chicken fried steak are great. The cobbler is a fine finish if you have the room."}
{"text":"OMG, I just ate here tonight. The PRIME RIB was the best I have ever eaten. I asked for medium rare and it was perfect. Melted in my mouth and I asked for extra Au Jus and the server brought me over a large cup of it. I thought I was in heaven. And The Chicken fried Chicken my husband ordered was the best I have ever eaten. My server was so attentive and the manager even asked me how it was. I told him I'm coming back soon. This place is the where I will bring friends and guests from out of town. And the mashed potatoes and gravy were the best I have EVER eaten. This is the second review I have ever written and I don't usually write it up unless it was exceptionally good or exceptionally bad. Love love this place if you are into excellent home cooked hearty food and a very comfortable atmosphere with caring people to serve you, come eat here.  I promise you will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"I'll be honest...I'm not a food connoisseur, but I know a good Chicken Fried Steak. Theirs is similar to how my mom makes it, and wow the portions are huge. And for the price? You just can't beat it. No wonder they are so popular and have been around forever. Love me some TexAZ, but be prepared: you get what you pay for, and for under $13 for a dinner don't expect some 5 star meal. Be realistic folks!"}
{"text":"There's Chicken Fried Steak, and then there's Texaz's Chicken Fried Steak.

The menu is small and consists mostly of meat and anything fried. Keep your cardiologist on speed dial if you come here often. The décor is quirky and fun. You could sit at every table in this restaurant and still not see everything they have to offer hanging on the walls. 

The only dilemma I have when I come here is whether to order the Chicken Fried Steak or the Chicken Fried Chicken. Both equally delicious.  Both served with a heaping mound of mashed potatoes and gravy... oh the gravy... it is so delicious I could drink it with a straw. 

The portion size here is HUGE. Do not try to eat everything they serve you; your stomach will likely implode."}
{"text":"I must start with a disclaimer. I gave them three stars because the type of food they serve does not fit my lifestyle or diet. And that is not necessarily a fair way to judge.

It is a very unique restaurant. Very old-school Phoenix. Much like the old pinnacle Peak patio. There is lots of nostalgia pieces hanging from the walls. Most of the staff has worked there for about 10 years or more. They really do offer fantastic service. It is a great place to bring guests from out of town so they can experience Old Phoenix.

Going back to the food. Lots of what they make is deep fried. Which if you love that kind of food this is your place. I understand the chicken fried steak is bigger than the plate. The pork chops I had I asked for them to be grilled and they were fine but bland. They did want me to put their gravy on it, Which I don't prefer, but I did ask for it on the side so I could taste it. To me it was not remarkable. Their salads are very much plain. They used mainly iceberg restaurant bag type mix. I had the balsamic dressing which they make and it was tasty but it was much too much of it for my taste. 

So I do hope you understand, just because this place isn't for me doesn't mean it isn't a lot of fun and a great place to go. Give it a try and draw your own conclusion."}
{"text":"This is one of those places I've had on my list for a long time. Finally, today a co-worker and I headed up there for lunch. 

The parking at lunch is a little nightmarish. I finally squeezed into a space though and we went inside.

The decor has already been described by other reviewers--it's someone's idea of what a Texas themed restaurant should look like, with all sorts of license plates and other crap hung up on the walls. The inside is much smaller than I imagined it would be, but we were seated quickly by a friendly hostess so I can't complain about that. 

We both had the chicken fried steak, which we had heard so much about. I thought it was okay. Not great, certainly not bad, but not really living up to the hype either. I loved the potatoes and gravy, though I have rarely met a mashed potato I didn't like. The corn was okay, and the biscuit was nothing great. That said, the price was good--$7.00 I think, and the portions were big. The service was friendly and fast. 

If I worked closer to this place I would go for lunch from time to time. As it is now, I'll probably try it again to see how the barbecue rates, but that's about it. I wanted to like it better, and it was okay, but nothing special."}
{"text":"In town on vacation liked the menu and good reviews. Small hometown place not big but homey. If I lived here I would e a regular. The waitress was one of my best ever. She always let you know what she was doing, the food out of this world. Smoked prime was the best ever and I love prime rib. My wife had chicken fried chicken and it was big and something you rarely see in this area. Great food, great service. I saw a complaint about sides etc. next time look at the menu. Great place for out of town or locals."}
{"text":"This place was OK for the money.  Took a party of four here to dinner, and we all had steaks of some sort.  Everybody at the table, including myself, was quite satisfied with the meal, with everyone's steak done the way they ordered. By the time you add drinks and other al a carte items to your meal, Texaz definitely isn't cheap, but for what you get you could do a lot worse at many places around Phoenix.  For sure this place is far better than any of the chain steakhouses like Longhorn, Outback or Black Angus, which should always be avoided when other options are available.Texaz is a neighborhood institution, which means it's worn and dirty, but I'm sure many people consider that to be part of this restaurant's charm. One caveat, especially for women with purses: the barriers between the booths in the front section don't go all the way down to the cushions, so it's possible and easy for adjacent diners to reach into your booth and take items out of your purse or coat without you noticing."}
{"text":"I loved the food!  Reminded me of my grandmother's cooking!  Cherie was a sweetheart!!"}
{"text":"Can only comment on the Chicken Fried Chicken - yum! A portion that 2 can share (unless you're overly hungry). Price is quite fair too. Served breaded and fried, southern style with corn/mashed potatoes. I'ts a smaller place so the closer you come to opening the better. There was a wait of 8 people at the door on a Saturday morning (10 minutes to open).

Super casual restaurant, decked out with nostalgic and Texas memorabilia."}
{"text":"I grew up in Fort Worth and pride myself on being a chicken fried steak connoisseur. It was by far the best I've had in Arizona. Didn't bring back childhood memories of dinner at the greasy spoon, but I would definitely go back for seconds. The wife and kids enjoyed theirs as well."}
{"text":"This place at one time seemed too \"high concept\", but multiple visits have convinced me that it is rather genuine: A plain-old Texas cultural embassy.

I think I've never had a bad meal there. The steaks could be thicker, I suppose. And they do grease 'em up before they grill 'em, but the over all effect with the mashed potatoes is pretty satisfying.

I always get a Shiner Bock when I'm there. At one time it was one of the few restaurants in the valley that had them available.

Parking is pretty bad, and the seats could be more comfortable. But basically, come hungry and leave happy."}
{"text":"First time back in a couple years...

This place serves the best Chicken Fried Steak in Phoenix! The staff are friendly, fast, and knowledgeable. Menu is simple and to the point. The memorabilia from Texas and Arizona should be in a museum. The prices are very reasonable! In fact, next time we are going to split one order. The \"bigger than the plate\" (and the plate was huge) CFS is only $12 and that includes a salad, bread, and fries...

Damn, I need to get here more often!"}
{"text":"They were out of prime rib so I opted for the ribeye and it was AMAZING! Come here before you drop $$$ at a fancy steakhouse!!!"}
{"text":"Very good food good service big servings.  Had the hamburger best burger in town!  Chicken fried steak is amazing!"}
{"text":"After completing a major work project this week, I was in the mood for some steak and decided to give this place a try. 
Located at the corner of E Bethany Home Road & N 16th St.
The first noticeable issue with the location is the lack of parking (-1).  The parking lot is extremely small and shared with other popular businesses.  Thankfully I got there a bit late and someone was pulling out. Even maneuvering within the parking lot is extremely difficult.  The signage for the restaurant could do with a sprucing up but was still somewhat noticeable from across the street. 
Staff were friendly but weren't overly friendly (-0.5).  They were attentive to our needs, like checking up on our meals, and even taking our orders in a timely fashion. 
The place is small inside but it has age and character.  Lots of memorabilia on the walls and ceilings.  Some booths aren't completely cordoned off so you can see fellow patrons beneath the partitions. 
Drinks were served timely but food took some time to come. 
Menus were simple, short, and not too in depth. 
Food tasted good - their ribeye was cooked to perfection and was soft, juicy, tender, and not overly seasoned; and the dish comes with fries or mashed potatoes with gravy, bread, a biscuit, coleslaw or salad.  The coleslaw was served on its own and fresh and too runny.  The bread and biscuit was warm.  The mashed potatoes were perfect - not dripping off your fork kinda mashed but semisolid enough, and the gravy complemented it really well. 
I'd love to come back and try their country fried steak which, I heard is good, but I'm reluctant to based on the abysmal parking situation."}
{"text":"Sign says something like 80,000 chicken fried steaks served here, and that's what you need to order. It's that good and it's only $7.50 at lunch.

Get an ice cold Shiner or Lone Star to go with it and sit at the bar if you can, for the view of the kitsch all over the walls, ceiling, and behind the counter.

Service with a smile and you'll be full when you leave.

Parking is kind of a bitch though."}
{"text":"went today for national fried chicken day absolutely amazing.  the largest chicken wings ever Kathy and I shared as a appetizer we only ate two because we also had lunch. briskets sandwich great ,rib eye mashed taters with gravy and corn superb. hope you keep the wings as a weekend thing thanks for a great experience always the best food and service"}
{"text":"I am from Tx. so whenever I start feeling homesick or start craving a chicken fried steak we head to Texaz. We live in Gilbert so it is quite a drive for us but so worth it. The chicken fried steak is one of the best I have ever had, and the gravy is so yummy! My son always has the burger and loves it. Their chili is really good too. In fact everything we have ordered has been great. The servers have always been extremely nice. This is not a fancy place, so if that is what you are expecting keep looking. Just good food by good people.  Parking can be a pain but there is extra parking behind the building. Been several times and will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Went here the other night with a group of friends. The staff was extremely accommodating for our crowd. The server was just awesome. And then there's the food. SO DELICIOUS! I had the chicken fried goodness and it was to die for. The gravy alone should be bottled and sold. If you are in the mood for some Texas sized portions and delicious Texas sized flavor....make this restaurant a stop for you!"}
{"text":"Okay, how can you not like Texaz Grill? Bad mood? Not hungry? Vegan? Bringing a baby carrier? Then you should probably stay home. Yes, it's a dive in an aging strip mall at 16th and Bethany. Yes, there is lots of junk hanging from the ceiling and walls that a few won't appreciate as low-brow Texas ambiance. And yes, the portions tend to be on the \"enormous\" side so if you're watching your waistline, plan on splitting a meal. 

But rest assured the place is a Phoenix icon and will be 'til way after you're gone. It is texas-style comfort food - nice and simple. The steaks are great - they cut and age their own like a real steakhouse. The prime rib, when you arrive early enough, is superb - and shockingly cheap considering the cut. And I doubt you'd find a better, more authentic texas-style chicken fried steak (and chicken fried chicken) anywhere in town. So big you'll want to share - or take 1/2 home. But is is goooood.

If you're a newbie to Texas Grill - it's good to know that probably 90% of the clientele are regulars and are likely close personal friends to the staff of many years. This tip is helpful so that you don't get lynched by the surrounding tables for dissing the busy waitress because your water glass gets low. Come to Texaz in a good mood and ready to eat and you'll be fine. In time the staff may take a cotton to you too - but you'll have to earn it.

There's not a mistake on the menu. One great value is to order the chop steak as a burger (it's not on the menu) and you'll have one of the best burgers in town. If you're a party of one or there's a few open seats - belly up to the bar. Tammy and Cindy are the usual evening bartenders and they serve one of the best margaritas in town - on the rocks (only) and with salt of course. The selection at the bar is simple and basic, but you'll be entertained all night trying to read decades of bumper stickers and fridge magnets. You may even meet a few new friends as the regulars are a friendly bunch (especially after a marg or two).

When visitors come to town, you can bet Texaz is always in the mix. Sure we hit Scottsdale for glam, downtown for urban cool, and Barrio or Richardsons for nuevo mexican - but for a fun evening with friends plus good comfort food, you can't beat Texaz.  Watch for us at the bar!"}
{"text":"Excellent fish fry. If you are looking for a lightly battered flakey cod with no heavy beer flavor this is the place for you Friday nights great price =) Not to mention juicy tender ribeye with big chunks of French fries."}
{"text":"We wandered in on a Wednesday night, not knowing quite what to expect - but we are glad we did.  Lots of quirky character inside, with just about every square inch of wall and ceiling covered with license plates, ball caps, and plenty of Texas tavern memorabilia.  Fair selection of bottled beers, though none on tap.  They tend to sell out of the prime rib, but I hope to give that a try next go around.  Steak and mashed potatoes were both decent, but my oh my - the breaded pork chop was out of this world tender and juicy!  I ordered a side of cole slaw which wasn't bad, but it definitely has onions in it, which was new to me.  The service was very attentive, and the restaurant had a nice homey feel to it - not what you'd expect to find in a strip mall, but that kinda adds to the charm."}
{"text":"Ok..I've been here 2 or 3 times and what I like the best is their atmosphere. My home is Dallas and so much of Texas is in this joint. The owner has lots of ties to Texas and it's a joy to speak with him especially the stories behind the pictures. I have always ordered the same dish, chicken fried chicken which is delicious except for some reason the gravy tastes a bit off, can't explain it.  So, what keeps me coming back, the atmosphere...next time I must try another dish and report on it."}
{"text":"I love Texaz Grill.  Food, service and atmosphere is always great.  Texas stuff all over"}
{"text":"Great food, friendly staff.  Funky neighborhood bar with kickass chicken fried steak,  new York strip,  mashed potatoes.   Portions huge. It's a must go to."}
{"text":"Hubby and I went here for lunch today and enjoyed it very much. We ordered a salad and fried okra to go along with the meal
  I had the Southern Pork Chop, mashed potatoes, corn, biscuits and gravy( I make better biscuits) and hubby had the Chicken Fry, which he brought half of home with us.
The pork chop was tender and juicy and almost fork tender, I ate all of it, left most of  the mashed potatoes and the corn, probably because we ate the salad and the okra first.
I like the inside although it is a little dark, very kitchy with all the license plates from all over.
I say go, eat, waddle home...it is worth it and it is great comfort food!"}
{"text":"Texaz Grill is amazing! I've been dinning there since I was a child. There's no place like it in the city. The decor is very unique and not like something you have seen before if raised in phoenix. The place is always packed I've never seen it not busy. Very welcoming staff as well. They serve the best home style cooked delicious food. I usually always get their specialty the chicken fried steak. It's defiantly my favorite and the main reason I keep coming back. It's a huge helping, almost falling off the plate because it's so big and you get 2 pieces with 2 sides! They also have great BBQ, fried foods, deserts, a great wine and beer list, and so much more. If you haven't tried texaz grill you must go!"}
{"text":"One of my favorite meals is the chicken fried steak, mashed potato's, both covered with milk gravy and a side of fried okra.  Talk about memories, my mom's is the best.  So when we discovered this place, we didn't know if it would match my memories or be another frozen mock up.

Walking in, the decor is really country chic, very old school, from the old photo's, the license plates to the lighting.  Our server was quick and friendly.  We got our food and it was delicious, since my meal didn't come with the fried okra, it was an add on, it came out way before our meal along with the bread, and both was eaten way before the main meal, but, they were hot and I didn't want them to cool off, so we ate.

As for the chicken fried steak, the breading was close, but not exact to my mothers, it didn't taste or look like a frozen piece, so it was one the best, chunky, breading, golden brown, tender steak.   So someone knew what they were doing with cube steak!"}
{"text":"Always wonderful food, service and vibe. A long standing establishment because it deserves to still be here. Come on over, eat plenty and join the clean plate club for deep savings. Enjoy, we did."}
{"text":"I knew it wasn't going to go well when I asked the guy at the front about my reservation and he pointed to the booth.  Didn't even offer to seat the party or anything.  We had 8 in the party and the server was Sharon.  She definitely came in with an attitude that she did not want to be there.  Totally gruff and unpleasant.  I asked here to go to the other end to take the rest of the orders after our side because they probably couldn't hear her over there.  She seemed to take offense to that and we all agreed that she was just plain rude.  Suffice it to say the service was mediocre at best and not deserving a tip but we left one anyway.  Sad thing is should could of made $25 more if she had just been nicer.  Now about the food, I really hoped for better but the over breaded chicken fried steak was bland and totally lacking any flavor.  The gravy was okay, nothing to write home about They serve it on this small plate which makes cutting it difficult.  The wrapped button was stuff under the roll on top of the mash potatoes which I found odd.  To top the meal off the waitress didn't even ask the mothers at the table if they wanted the free apple pie.  Will not be returning or recommending this place to anyone."}
{"text":"I heart (attack) Texaz Grill. My tummy (arteries) were filled with good ole, down home cooking. My NY strip was perfection and dripping with flavor (cholesterol). Rickie's a Texas boy so he knows his chicken fried anythings, and his chicken fried chicken was smothered in love (gravy) and he nibbled every bite (inhaled like there's no tomorrow). I chased my taters, sauteed shrooms and steak down with a cold Dos XX and a Patron shot. All this with attentive and friendly service. The room reminded me of the shack Steve Martin lived in, in the beginning of The Jerk. And for this place, the license plates, posters and bric a brac that cover every corner, including the ceiling above the urinal, yes, guys get this...when you have to pee so badly, you arch your  head back with an eye rolling groan...that's how I saw the posters on the ceiling. But all the kitchy crap everywhere works for Texaz Grill. The menu has all kinds of steaks and wonderful sides. The only thing missing is a defibrillator."}
{"text":"Um......I've been coming here since i was a child. I still love coming to this amazing establishment.  If its not business cards or trucker hats hanging from the ceiling that get your attention. Then its the amazing Chicken Fried Steak you can get there!!!!! If you have friends from Texas visiting Az. Definetly take them there......They will love it!!! hahha..."}
{"text":"Craving a Chicken fried steak for brunch? TexAz is definitely the place to satisfy the craving. The Steak is seasoned to perfection and the breading and frying has been perfected with a wonderful crisp and color- a must try!  Served with mashed potatoes, gravy, corn and a nice fresh and flaky biscuit. However, if you are looking for something on the sweeter side to satisfy the sweet tooth, the texas French toast is another absolute find. Make sure to come hungry and wear loose clothing, the meal is so good you will want to eat it all. Make sure to start with the sticky cinnamon buns, I mean at this point the diet is out the window. 
Minus 1 star... I blame them for gaining a lb or 2lbs."}
{"text":"Nearly 900k chicken fried steaks served since they opened forever ago. I think that's what their sign says. I've been driving by on Bethany Home since '85and I see that number changing all the time. Must mean this place is amazing. Loads of good ratings on Yelp. Must mean this place is amazing. 

There were 2 of us. We both opted for the chicken fried steak. It's what they're known for. So, when you haven't been somewhere before you go with their claim to fame. Oops.

The fried steak was buried beneath too much breading for my taste. I found the steak to be tender but bland. The gravy had good flavor and it was easy to set aside some as it was plentiful.

The front-end staff was friendly. I think the waitress wasn't too happy with a 2-top on a busy night that didn't order alcohol, appetizers, sides, etc. She did her job. But, she didn't put much effort in - cost the total tab a dessert thus cost the tip a bit as a direct result. I really want dessert after dinner but I don't order unless the server asks or offers - that should be automatic and requires zero effort for the potential for a bigger tip. 

Perhaps this place is better targeted toward people who have more of a taste for Texas inspired food than I."}
{"text":"The BEST Prime Rib, Thursday night special and Rib eye in town. And Tammy makes it worth it all!"}
{"text":"The bomb.com chicken fried steak. Never had it better than here! Love this place and the old school decor."}
{"text":"My hubby found this place online and we decided to give it a try. We started with the onion rings. Beyond delicious. Then I got the filet and mashed potatoes and he got the chicken fried steak. Everything was amazing. The service was great. The people were friendly and we stuffed ourselves because it was so good we couldn't help ourselves. We will be back. Home cooking and comfort food like you would not believe. Overall fair prices, nice people and delicious food. Thanks for a nice time."}
{"text":"Is their infamous Chicken Fried Everything enough to blow me up into a giant hot air balloon until I go to 'Awesome-Portion-Heaven?' Yes. Is this something I'm gonna regret when I finally drag my body to the gym? Yes, BUT, I argue that you only live once and you should try one of the finest Chicken Fried Steaks around. The only bad thing I will say though is that their gravy is a little bland just by itself. I like mah gravy to taste like it could be an entree of it's own like it should, not as just a topping, but that's just the fatty inside me talking. Also, they get ya by asking if you want some more sauce or more of this, then when the bill comes they tack on extra money without warning me and I can't do anything but a major facepalm."}
{"text":"Yet another visit to Texaz.  
Tips for my Yelp friends:
1.  Happy hour 4-6 pm half price beers/wine/.etc 
plus special entrees
2.  If you visit several times, be sure to get a \"Clean Plate Card\" started up.  Bring it back for each visit and something real good will soon happen.
3.  Ask for Devin as a waiter - excellent service.

My wife had catfish for the first time in her life; she enjoys many seafood varieties but never pulled the catfish handle.  Really enjoyed it.
Southern style pork chops were great as always.

Do it!!!"}
{"text":"Living in New York city for so many years I would chuckle over tourists. Just standing abruptly in utter fascination, usually in the middle of the sidewalk, blocking commutes in Times Square. In the office we would chalk it up to visual overload. 

So when I walked into TEXAZ Grill and behaved similarly I laughed at myself. Opening the doors to this restaurant was unbelievable. Memorabilia from the Great State of Texas. Covers. Every. Square. Inch.  

Neon lights greeted me.  \"Texas!\" (Also neon shapes of Texas were everywhere.) An old school juke box. Beer signs galore. Guitars hanging. A giant gull head. Horns. John Wayne behind the bar. \"Happy Birthday Texas!\" The best collection of inappropriate stickers *ever*. License plates of every state covered the bar. The collection has been cultivated over 28 years by the the owner and patrons. (Tip: When you go, feel free to bring stuff in!)

Anyhoo, stuff. My eyeballs were full. Finally I made it to the bar and met Tammy. (A hoot who has worked here 18 years!) After inquiring where I was from, a peppy response, \"Well, welcome to Texas!\" (And so I fell in love with this place. Before food even factored into the equation.)

ENTREES
So the food... A tad concerned there wouldn't be a healthy option to consume I was incredibly wrong. (Plenty of non-fried options!) The ribeye steak was to die for. (Perhaps the mashed potatoes with gravy were necessary to consume. But I just had to try them!) 

The meat was prepared to the exact pinkness level requested. I can't even describe the level of food happiness that transpired that night. The meat was just so tender. I had made the mistake of noshing on the spicy hot peanuts available on the bar, as well as eating my way thru the delightfully prepared coleslaw that accompanied the meal.

Amateur hour. Yes, definitely eat the coleslaw. It was flavorful and not too heavy in mayo. (Or try the salad with the blue cheese. Wonderful chunks of cheese.) But leave space for your meal!

As I wasn't dining solo I had the opportunity to sample a burger. Holy bejeebers. This isn't a frou frou burger. This is a simply prepared burger, sans grease, on a beautiful bun with high quality meat. 

DESSERT
We earned a bread pudding! One second and I'll explain how. Tough decision as to what to pick but we went with the french bread in an egg custard with toasted pecans & raisins. Why? It was topped with a bourbon sauce! Dense and delicious. Served as described. Warm. Mmm mmm mmm! Biggest scoop of ice cream too!

CLEAN PLATE CLUB
Clean you plate at lunch and get one punch. Two punches for dinner. EIGHT punches equals ONE dessert! How sweet is that? :)

HH
Mon-Thur 3-6pm
1/2 bottled beer
Wine by the glass
All well drinks

As they say there \"It doesn't get any better kids!\"

We loved sitting at the bar for dinner! Great experience!"}
{"text":"HOLY CRAP!  Texaz is the meat-lovers paradise. DO IT!"}
{"text":"We used to live within walking distance of Texaz Grill back in the late 90's.  We pretty much O.D.'ed on the place.  Yeah, it's that good.  What some might call, \"A heart attack on a plate\", I call \"Redneck Paradise\" (minus the boots, Bermuda shorts, wife beater tee, and cowboy hat, of course).  Texaz grill serves the best Chicken Fried Steak and Chicken Fried Chicken I've ever had.  Be forewarned though.  If you come, bring your appetite.  If you leave Texaz hungry, it's your own fault.  

The portion sizes are more than generous; I think \"Obscene\" is more accurate.  The mashed potatoes are mashed with the skins on and smothered in thick white gravy, as was my chicken.  The corn niblets are nice and buttery and the chicken was nice and crispy.  My co-workers had the chicken fried steak and the steak was larger than the plate.  You also get a biscuit, although I'd prefer a roll, I just forgot to ask.

The Chicken Fried Steak and Chicken were both $7.00 and the Iced Tea was $2.00.  I feel it's a pretty fair deal for lunch.  The Texas and Arizona memorabilia that adorn the walls and ceiling are fitting for this place.  I remember when you could smoke in restaurants and it was very smokey too.  I'm so glad the smoking ban passed.  I've heard the place can get busy for lunch, so we went early and didn't have any problems finding parking and we were seated right away and served promptly.  Texaz Grill gets 5 stars in my book and I'm sure they'd appreciate it if you left the Bermuda shorts at home and come fully clothed.  Now for that angioplasty..."}
{"text":"Best chicken fried steak, chicken fried chicken, steak fries, biscuits, rolls, coleslaw, desserts, ice cold Shiner Bock, crafted cocktails, need I say more? My husband and I can split a chicken fried steak dinner, and still have some for breakfast the next day! I'd say that's worth the $17 a plate price, for 3 meals. Parking can get a little crazy, try going for happy hour during the week before 6 for dinner. You will get $2.25 bottles of Shiner Bock and a parking space! If you do go and can't find a spot to park, don't give up, the food is worth the walk. This place is also super family friendly. There is just enough noise for you parents with younger ones to not feel bad if the kiddo gets noisy. Their kid's menus are Armadillos that you can color, cut out, and fold to make 3-D. The friendly host was telling the kids jokes, and asking Texas trivia questions. Adults without kids, not to worry, there's a nice comfy bar stool waiting for you in the back!"}
{"text":"First time experience was utterly fantastic! On a friday night we were seated quickly, server was on top of her game, fried okra appetizer served promptly, warm bread with real butter, salad was refreshing (loved the minced green olives on top), T-bone steak was cooked to perfection. We were stuffed but had to try the peach cobbler pie and sundae, so glad we did! Added bonus, the owner came to our table to greet us and ask how everything was. We will be frequenting this establishment. Thanks for the delicious food and great service!"}
{"text":"You can't beat the Tuesday Rib Special.  I highly recommend it."}
{"text":"How have I never been here before? This restaurant is ridiculous. It is over the top, covered in Texas themed stuff, business cards covering the ceiling, and complete with Texas sized portions. I came here with my dad and his friend yesterday for lunch and was very impressed with this place. The lunch prices are a total steal, with most entrees costing 8$ and the portions big enough for two people. We split the (house specialty) chicken fried steak and a brisket sandwich. I don't know that I've ever had chicken fried steak before, and I don't know that I would ever have it again (the idea of frying steak just doesn't sit well with me.... if I'm gonna eat steak, I want to taste it), but this CFS was fairly good. The meat was surprisingly tender, the gravy was flavorful, the portion was obscenely large. It came with very tasty mashed potatoes, a biscuit, and some plain jane corn. The biscuit was good, but not the best in town. The real star of this place was the brisket. Ohhhh the brisket gods smile on this place for sure. Their brisket is super tender and the sauce they put on it was heavenly. I ate the brisket with a fork out of the bun because the bun just obscured the awesome brisket flavor, no need for it. I will definitely come back here for the brisket!"}
{"text":"Staff is great! Food is good and large portions! Parking can be frustrating at times."}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite places to eat.  It has the best chicken fried chicken I have ever had, and the mashed potatoes are excellent.  The salad is simple yet delicious.  The thing with Texaz grill is that I believe you can only go there and order 2 things off of their menu.  They are famous for the chicken fried chicken and the chicken fried steak, this is what you must order, and this is what everyone comes back for. If you are not a fan of these 2 items, then this place is not for you. Everything else on the menu is just average.  The portions are huge, you can easily split an order with someone, or take half of your meal home for left overs, which I think is a great value.  The decor is like a in the middle of nowhere Texas bar,  it's not fancy, and it's not meant to be."}
{"text":"My boyfriend has the winning review for tonight:

\"I'd slit my wrists, but you'd never get the grease out of the upholstery.\"

Texaz is neither a steakhouse nor a diner. 

It is a little piece of nostalgia for those who miss their mother's (mediocre) dinners. Portions are ridiculously over-sized, the cow is proudly \"unseasoned,\" and grease takes the place of, well... everything. It should all add up to ultimate comfort, but we left feeling full-up on drippings without any flavor to show for it. It's a McDonald's feeling. If that's your guilty pleasure, go for it. But do it on your own hung-over time. I wouldn't bring friends here.

I loved the restaurant itself. Everyone who worked there was beyond amazing. Just really good people who clearly loved the place and who wanted their guests to love it too. The kitsch was fun, the energy was upbeat and comfortable, and I appreciate any place that has such a dedicated following of regulars.

The flagship chicken fried steak had a lot going for it. It was big enough to feed a family of four, tender enough to be cut with a fork (really!), and it held up its light crispiness under the white gravy. That's a super-human feat, and it amazed me all night. On the down side, the cutlet lacked flavor, which is the whole point of a round steak. Ultimately, it was comforting, but only because it was totally expected and not notably bad.

The steak list is cut in-house (except the t-bone, I think). The menu boasts that the steaks are free of seasoning and tenderizer, so we expected the rib-eye to be full of flavor and fat. Instead, it was presented swimming in oil (shortening? flavorless drippings?) and wasn't good for anything except as a sponge for Worcestershire sauce. We sent most of it back.

Both mashed and fried potatoes were good, and the slaw was refreshing. 

I know these are minor, but: 
-Why does the bread basket have a single dinner roll and a single biscuit in it?
-Why don't they have sweet tea?
-Why is their Shiner Bock served in a 7oz glass?"}
{"text":"My search for chicken fried steak has finally come to an end. It was bigger than the plate!!! Hands down the best I've had."}
{"text":"Love Love Love. Waitresses are superb. Beef Kabobs - scrumptious. Prime Rib (if you get there early enough) is rare (my fav) and generous. The Shrimp cocktail - wow. And what's not to love on Fish Friday - Cod. Waitress' Coby and our gal are more than Outstanding. It gets kinda crowded, but we are a larger group (10+) and love our food and the smiling, quick, smart service."}
{"text":"I'm sorry but this place probably has the worst turkey club i have ever had. thick sliced lunchable meat with regular american cheese, bacon, lettuce tomato. on a hot toasty bun... didn't quite sit right, i probably ordered the worst thing on the menu. but i wasn't to crazy about the potato chunk fried fries either..... but what do i know! the chicken fried steak is probably awesome, but i needed something light and quick at the time! 

the place was really dirty above your head no telling whats getting on the food that you are about to eat. and all the walls were super cluttered with decor, and dusty hats hanging everywhere, kind of gross.

service was awesome, and the people were cool. but not enough to come back to."}
{"text":"I went with a party of four, and was the only one not to order the chicken fried steak - - rather, my heart was set on chicken fried chicken.  Now, I'm not a gravy person, so I ordered my chicken w/o gravy.  This was the most flavorless piece of fried chicken I've ever eaten.  The breading had ZERO seasoning in it, and the chicken was not seasoned.  While it was moist, it required generous amounts of tabasco to make it edible.  What a let down.  The buttermilk biscuit was good...and that was all I'd describe as above average."}
{"text":"I like this place very unique decorum staff is really great checked on us throughout our meal. Had the catfish it was good I'd recommend this place"}
{"text":"I don't why I wanted to come so bad, because I'm not generally into chicken fried steak, but sometimes you get a craving, ya know? Finally, we had a chance and took the family. This place is at the corner of 16th St and Bethany Home and the parking lot can be slightly awkward. I think we went on a Thurs night and they had dinner chicken and dumplings ($10) for one of the daily specials. I REALLY wanted chicken fried steak ($12.50) but what in the hell was I going to do with all the steak I heard they give you? Um, no. I did manage to convince my husband to share some of his even though he insisted he was going to eat the entire thing. Mind you, this was before we saw the portions! So, the hubby ordered the chick fried steak, me the chick-n-dumplings, son ordered tke kids cheeseburger ($6.50) and 3 year old shared our food. We also had the fried okra app that was so good. Breaded just right, tender and with a horseradish-type sauce. YUM. When the food came out, I was laughing so hard at how large the chicken fried steak was. Needless to say, my husband was NOT eating that whole thing. He wasn't a huge fan of it, but I was. I thought it was flavored well and I really liked the batter (think a light beer batter). My chicken and dumplings were awesome. The chicken was plentiful and tender, within the white gravy, and biscuits soft. It came with a side of buttered corn, too, which were good. Oh yeah, my meal came with a choice of salad or slaw. I chose the slaw which was creamy, just the way I like it. The kids burger was good, and it was neat because it also comes with an individually packaged, small Blue Bell ice cream scoop. Th kids loved that. The service was great, too. The server was friendly in addition to the other staff. Would I come back for the chicken fried steak? Maybe not, but I definitely would for the chicken and dumplings. Maybe after I sweat enough calories at Bikram yoga!"}
{"text":"My stand-by easy night for dinner and a drink spot.

I prefer to sit at the bar with Tammy and have a salad and a burger, or maybe the Chicken or Beef Kabob (Ask for it dry \"no butter\").

Also love the Chili and the Fried Shrimp.  Ask for extra mushrooms is yummy to me.  Furthermore, the Thursday BBQ special rocks (but split it with someone as it is huge).  The Friday night Fish and Chips is delicious.

Not a fan of Liver and Onions ever so I wouldn't order it.  Sometimes the salads can be pretty heavy on dressing.  

Biggest gripe = I used to order my Vodka Tonic, till I found out they use an \"Absolute 100\" vodka or something similar that is 100 Proof.  In my opinion it is totally wrong to serve somebody  a \"100\" vodka versus the normal \"80\".  It is the same as ordering a rum and coke and getting Barcadi 151 rum instead.   A totally different product.  Can you tell this is an issue for me?

Otherwise one of my favorite watering holes for sure.  Nice people too."}
{"text":"Not my favorite anything. Unfortunately this being our 1st time to this place we were kind of ignored. You could visually identify all the regulars by who the servers were talking to and checking on. Our drinks were not checked the entire time even when our food was served. The bathrooms are so small you have to keep the door open to bend down and grab your pants to pull them up. Literally the walls were touching my shoulders. Not a place I will be suggesting any time soon"}
{"text":"I found this restaurant on Yelp and went for dinner based on the reviews. Texaz was great on all points. Even though the menu was not extensive the items were well rounded. Prices were very reasonable, portions were large and food was delicious! My husband had the chicken fried steak and I had the smoked, barbecue spare ribs. Service was efficient and friendly. I would definitely go there again."}
{"text":"My aunt recommend this place to me so my boyfriend and I went for dinner. Let me say the portions are HUGE. I barely even made a dent... Then again my boyfriend finished all his food. He got the ribeye and I had the early dinner fish. My boyfriend loved his steak and thought it was better than much more expensive steaks he has had. My fish was crispy and moist. Very yummy! Definitely come with an appetite."}
{"text":"This place is fantastic all the food is served bigger than the table and just because the portions are huge there is no lack of flavor this place is great I felt like I was actually in Texas ... You have to try it if you want to know what a real country fried steak is."}
{"text":"OMG I had the Brisket sandwich for lunch and it was huge and fantastic, it's a pretty finely chopped brisket and I loved it! You also get a side of potatoes! My friend had the chicken fried steak but refused to share, it looked delicious though!!"}
{"text":"Really good chicken fried steak, great service and large portions.  Will definitely go again."}
{"text":"This place came with raving reviews. While visiting with friends we decided to try this place based on photos and yelp reviews. The chicken fried steak was huge, but that was the only think good about it. It lacked flavor and seasoning. The gravy was strange, a cross between white and brown gravy. The mashed potatoes were ok but covered with the gravy. The prime rib was ok but the smoke taste was overwhelming. The parking was a sign but we decided to try it. A restaurant without windows is quite depressing even with the eclectic decor.  The people and service was good. This place was not for us."}
{"text":"I have eaten here several times I have tried many things on the menu and I have never been disappointed. The prices are not bad, the food is really good, and the staff is polite and professional. I live on the east valley and I am always finding excuses to drive out to Phoenix to eat here."}
{"text":"I am from Texas and I do love the regional food. My husband had been craving a good chicken fried steak, so we decided to try TEXAZ Grill.

The parking can be a pain. If you pull into the spots right in front of the building, they're for compact cars, and there's no valet. There is a lot behind the building with ample sized spots, so look for the turn in off Bethany Home.

The decor is a little tacky and over the top, but I guess that adds to the restaurant's charm. The staff is friendly and helpful.

Chicken fried steak - awesome. The portion is huge, and it's cooked just like it should be. Accompanying mashed potatoes are quite good. I was surprised that the brisket sandwich was so good. The meat is really tender, flavorful, and thick cut. I like that they top it with BBQ sauce and then provide extra on the side. Portion was also big, although the chicken fried steak is hard to beat in terms of quality, quantity, and price. My husband and I could have split it and still had leftovers.

We had plenty of leftovers and couldn't try any dessert (unfortunately) because we were so full. I really want to go back and try the other menu items, like the chili, one of their many steaks, and the chicken fried chicken. If you like Texas staples, give TEXAZ Grill a try."}
{"text":"You just can't beat this down home comfort food! Chicken Fried Steak, Chicken Fried Chicken and that cream gravy like Grandma used to make for after church Sunday dinner!"}
{"text":"Texaz is fun!  I grew up in Texas and this is the real deal.  The chicken fried steak is my fave.

But, last night, Mom and I hit Texaz for dinner and decided to share the fried shrimp platter.  Each shrimp is as big as your head!  Ok, maybe not, but they are a good size, about 3-4 inches.  For $15 is was a deal.  I added an extra salad for $2.

All dinners come with salad, choice of potatoes (fried or mashed -- the fried potatoes are chunks of potatoes, deep fried; the mashed are still a bit chunky with white gravy), and a roll and a biscuit.

The salad is basic -- iceberg lettuce and tomatoes.  Ranch or olive vinaigrette for dressing.  The olive is great!

Shiner bock is the house beer for $3.25 a bottle, other domestics are $2.75 each and imports are $3.75.

Our dinner, two salads, 2 Coors lights and one JD on the rocks was $29 including the tip.

Yee haw!
Y'all come back now, y'hear?!"}
{"text":"This is a divey looking place, but it it is a steakhouse and it was pretty darned good.  Prime Rib was awesome.  I thought the gravy on the mashed left a little bit to be desired.  Service was great.  I'd go back."}
{"text":"While in Phoenix we stopped in here for lunch.  There is a great ambiance here and a great Texas style feel to it.  I had the chicken fried steak.  The menu claims it is fork tender.  While I wouldn't go quite that far, it was very good, served with mashed potatoes and plenty of cream gravy.  The star of the show was my wife's brisket club sandwich.  It was absolutely delicious and so tender.  It was served with a very course cut of home fries (Texas size) and was also very good.  If you get the chance, definitely stop in."}
{"text":"What great food...had been wanting to visit this restaurant and I was not disappointed. Food was awesome and service was top notch. My daughter was given some candy and a toy to play with. Nice personal touch."}
{"text":"I really want to give this restaurant a good review for the steaks. I can't. I tried twice. The fist time a went here I had the prime rib. The flavor was perfect but way too much fat. The Texas fries were over cooked. I went beck last night and I ordered the porterhouse along with the Texas fries again. I'm was disappointed. This was not a good steak. I like the severs and the restaurant. I really wanted to enjoy a good steak here but twice it didn't happen."}
{"text":"I love this place.  It's the best chicken fried steak EVER. Ask for Joey, she's the best server there!"}
{"text":"GOOD FOOD AND GREAT SERVICE. I'm from Texas and I miss the good ole home cooked food; this is the place to get a great piece of Texas."}
{"text":"I remember when this location was the original Carlos O'Brien's and then moved to it's new location.  Lone Star Steaks moved in and for several years it was a terrific steak house run by Texans.  They served up a great chicken fried steak and other Texas favorites and developed a good local following.  Then the corporations came in and made them cease and desist using the name Lone Star (beer and steak corps) which really was a shame.  They came back with the name TexAZ Grill.  The menu stayed the same as did the local following of patrons.  They have great pork chops, steaks and the BEST chicken fried steak in the city!  The whiskey bread pudding is one of the Hubby's favorites and I do indeed enjoy the pecan pie a la mode so sweet your teeth ache.  Staff is outstanding!"}
{"text":"Simply put, if you like chicken fried steak and you haven't been here you don't really like chicken fried steak.  I've eaten chicken fried steak pretty much everywhere in the world that its available and it just doesn't get much better than this.  Go with the fried potatoes instead of the mashed.  Not that the mashed are bad, just that the fried potatoes are so GOOD.  For those that are less enthusiastic about chicken fried steak, the fried chicken breast is also great as are the steaks and burgers.  Love the house salad with light oil dressing and diced olives on top.  Oh, and the biscuits, top notch, TOP NOTCH.  Don't let them get away with bringing you a bread basket that's half filled with biscuits and half filled with some wheat roll disaster, ask for all biscuits.  You're welcome."}
{"text":"Yep -- still my favorite hole-in-the-wall eatery awesomeness. The brisket sandwich with cheddar and slaw and dippin' sauce was to die for. I ate at the bar and just enjoyed my visit.  Can't wait til I can walk here!"}
{"text":"Eh, this place is alright.  We wanted to try something new this weekend and we happened to drive by so we gave Texaz Grill a shot.  I of course yelped it first to decide what I was going to eat, and the response was overwhelmingly to get the Chicken Fried Steak.  Okay then.  

Inside, this place is literally covered in crap.  There are business cards along the door frame and all over the ceiling.  Baseball caps literally line the entire perimeter of the room and then some.  There really isn't an inch of space that hasn't been covered with some form of Texas style memorabilia.  

I got the chicken fried steak, obviously, and it came with mashed potatoes, corn, and a biscuit.  The potatoes were okay, nothin special, the corn was okay but a little peppery, the biscuit was very bland and the bottom was a bit hard, and the chicken fried steak was just ok.  I've had a few chicken fried steaks in my life, and this one did not stand out.  It was really crisp and crunchy on the outside, which I like, but flavor-wise, there was just something missing.  It was just okay.  Service was quick and efficient.  We had our meal in under 30 minutes, so that was nice I guess.  I probably won't be back, but at least I tried."}
{"text":"being a carnivore, this is my kind of place...  had the combination plate of ribs and brisket, bbq'd... more food than I should of had at that time of nite.. had to eat it all.... my bad..  will return again and again as long as it doesn't change.."}
{"text":"We were visiting from LA , this has been on our to try list. The service is just like being in Texas. We lived there for a few years. Service is friendly and attentive. Tall glass of ice tea, Texas style
Had the bbq beef sandwich, very tasty. The ff were good,  they were not the Texas ff I use to get. These are thick and cubed.  The gentleman who I presume is the owner was very nice and stops by to ask if all is well. Nice throwback feel of a small town eatery.."}
{"text":"Five stars?  Eek.  

I dont wanna get all highbrow here, but prospective diners probably shouldnt harbor illusions about a place charging $7 for a couple of chicken fried \"steaks\" big enough to flop over the edge of the plate.  

Neither of us finished our cow patties and we both felt a little sick afterwards. Not violently ill or anything, just that bloated, greasy feeling culminating in a concise bout of diarrhea.  

The service is ok and it's cheap, but in terms of food quality, there are half a dozen better restaurants within a hundred yards of this place - seven if you count Taco Bell."}
