{"text":"I enjoyed my Montreal smoked meat sandwich and chicken soup with a Matzo ball. Their rye bread is delicious. I also like the challah bread and their cream cheese."}
{"text":"I've been to Yitz's a couple times with friends and we've always enjoyed the food, atmosphere, and service.  I love that they have different kinds of homemade mustard to pair with your sandwich and I absolutely love their coleslaw! You can never go wrong with their easy on the wallet lunch deals for under $10.00 (awesome portions as well).  One day we decided to buy a loaf of bread and my goodness, was it ever THE BEST bread I've ever had.. EVER. Haven't had the chance to go back for a second loaf and second assessment (in case the first time was just a good day) but will definitely do an update once I get the chance."}
{"text":"Yitz's has delicious, plentiful meals with friendly service. Great take-aways like soups and pastries, cream cheese...."}
{"text":"I really wanted to fall in love with this place as I live in the neighbourhood. However, the meat (tried Pastrami, Montreal Smoked Meat and Corned Beef) fell way short of basic expectations. They almost all tasted a bit rubbery and almost a bit like a deli counter meat. The saving grace was the excellent waitstaff, vintage atmosphere, the potato latkes, coleslaw, great pickles and potato salad which were amazing, though this cannot carry the weight of the whole experience.   My deli experiences range across North America at such places like Katz's and Kenny and Ziggys in Houston to Schwartz's in Montreal, Katz's and Centre Street in the GTA and Katz's in New York. So a wide variety of places to compare with.  I would go back maybe to try the other various items on the menu."}
{"text":"I have so much love for this place. The chocolate chip cookies are out of this world."}
{"text":"Fantastic corned beef sandwiches, cute coins fries and fantastic waitresses? What's not to love? For 25 years I've been grabbing the occasional meal here and it's been consistently enjoyable."}
{"text":"I really wanted to love Yitz's.  Lots of good memories about this place from my childhood, warm, welcoming owner who chatted us up, classic deli service (highly competent, slightly rude).  It has a lot going for it.  But, my corned beef on rye (waiter's recommendation - \"it's the best in the city\") was just ordinary, and the kishke was poor as well.  That said, this was a first visit in 20 years - I'm not willing to give up on it that quickly.  I'll be back and will refine this review later."}
{"text":"Their bakery is phenomenal and their dine-in food is good for the price. Nothing on the menu is fancy. And just the right atmosphere for nothing fancy."}
{"text":"I think Yitz's has seen better days, I took 5 kids with me there today for lunch.  The interior although kitsch is tired and no longer fun.  The tables are wobbly and the place could use a good  cleaning.  They have a lunch special for $9.95, it consists of Soup, and then your choice of Ceasar/Greek Salad (as a meal) or a Deli Sandwich or Cabbage Rolls or a Chicken Dinner and last but certainly least Hamburger & Fries.  Our order: 3 Minestrone Soups 2 Matzo Ball Soups 1 Chicken Noodle 2 Corn Beef on Rye (the rye has caraway in it, I do like that but not everyone does) 1 Ceasar Salad 1 Greek Salad 1 Hamburger & Fries Potato Latkes 4 Cokes and an Ice Tea  The minestrone was very thick have had a lot better.  I did like the chicken broth in the Matzo Ball Soup but the dumpling was  a bit heavy. The sandwiches are smaller versions then you usually get at a deli but really how much meat do you need. They were also a bit dry.  The hamburger was not good at all the bun was stale and the frozen crinkle dollar fries well were food court material.    The potato latkes are too thick over deep fried and not homemade. Two on the plate with apple sauce $6.75.  The Greek/Ceasar salad as the lunch meal is served on a bread plate.  The Ceasar is just romaine with sparse dressing and about 5 croutons.  The greek salad was good with ample feta and tomatoes but it just lacked in a lunch size portion for $9.95.  Be forwarned the pop is $1.95 each plus tax, the one ice tea for a 7 year old is $3.25 plus tax ouch....my fault didn`t read the menu.  Bill was $81.70 plus tip.....i guess not bad for 6  people i just wish the food was more fresh & better portions.    1 star for the chicken broth and 1 star for service that was good."}
{"text":"I love Yitz's baked goods and ready to go items. The Vegetable loaf, is good and so is  the Yitz's burger."}
{"text":"Not a good experience for me, but it isn't a brunch place. In fairness they are a bakery and my husband said his smoked meat sandwich was, \"okay.\" My fried eggs were rubbery and gross, the tomatoes were hard and tasteless, and the fries were fine at best.  The atmosphere is dark and a little dingy. The waitress was nice but not very helpful. She messed up our bill and we wound up being chased out of the restaurant by another waitress telling us we owed an additional $10.  Though we didn't try it, the baked smelled fresh and yummy. So I am only reviewing brunch at Yitz's: don't go for brunch."}
{"text":"The decor has not changed one iota since I was a child! Neither has the food and both of these things are definitely positives. This is proper Jewish comfort food. Huge, buttery, fluffy matzo balls and latkes, coleslaw with the perfect balance of sweet to vinegary, broths not too salty with just the right amount of grease, even the kid's french fries (silver dollars) were impressively fresh, light and crispy. Wonderfully friendly and attentive service as well. I can still picture my Bubie there and I hope Yitz's will always be there for the comforting memories and delicious, unpretentious, gorgeous food."}
{"text":"Been coming here since when i was a greenie when La Salle was an all boy's school, which speaks loads on the longevity and how enduring this place is. In the vein of Kosher delis like Scwhartz, Katz, Carnegie, Queen/Kings Deli this is a true Torontonian perspective. What i mean is the distinctive combination of the upper crust forest hill (old ultra conservative) attitude combined with wholesome immigrant food/culture - the melting pot which is canadian culture. Don't bother with Pickle Barrell just come straight here -My Favs:   Knishes 3.50  Chopped Liver 5.75  Cabbage Roll 5.75 - delish  Chicken Matzo Ball or Noodle 3.95  Cabbage Borscht 3.95 - must have  Tongue 7.50  Baby Beef 750  Large Knuckwurst 4.25  Potato Latkes with Applesauce 3.95 - must have  Lox & Cream Cheese 9.95  Rogelach 2.95 - best anywhere  Chocolate Chip Cookies - true  foodie reminded me thanks Hailey E.   Upside you can buy your stogies for after the meal.  Downside too old for the JAP private school girls (Bishops, Havergal) who frequent this place for lunch and after school in daddy's Bemmer."}
{"text":"Who ya gonna call when you need a lunch combo for under $10 on Eglington Avenue West - Yitz's Deli... that's who.  Wandering the streets when you suddenly realize \"It's as cold as an arctic vortex out here and I'm kinda hungry.\" Means that you want warm, comfy food that fills you up and makes you fell all kinds of good.   Yitz's was nothing to write home to your bubbe about in terms of it's looks and service, basic marks all around, buy that Montreal Style Smoked Meat, Oy Vay!!! Piled high, cooked to perfection and in between two slices of rye bread and a mountain of coleslaw I was one happy fella.  But hold on that sandwich brought a friend, for the $10 lunch special I also got to have a Matzo ball soup that made my mothers meatballs look like raisins (and Mamma U does not make a small ball). The matzo ball was super tender and tasted lovely however I wasn't really a fan of the broth. It was overly salty and tasted closer to that green/yellow Lipton Chicken Noodle out of the packet than something freshly made with tender love and care. A good chicken soup should be the equivalent of Jewish Penicillin and cure you of all things that ale you - this soup made me thirsty.   That said, the sandwich more than makes up the difference, so make sure you stop by for one on the go. They also have a whole menu of jewish food faves (knish, etc) so I'll be back to try the rest of this menu on for size.  Eatcrest Out!"}
{"text":"This review is just for the cigar section of the deli. yes believe it or not they do sell cigars. Its more of a humidified cabinet behind the counter. They did have some accessories on display nothing out of ordinary. Prices are OK not the best but better than other for sure. Decent selection of Cuban stuff with all the major brands being represented. The cashier was very knowledgeable and helped me in what to pick. They do accept Credit Cards so that is a plus.  The breads and other baked goods looked good though I didn't try any. Can be a reason to visit I guess when making a cigar purchase :)"}
{"text":"Very delicious food here. You walk in and the aroma of the deli meats and breads is outstanding. Service was very quick. They have a nice seating area in the back. Their kinishes are deeeelicious. Reminds me of an uptown caplanskys. However, their sandwich deals are amazing and worth the trip."}
{"text":"A fun, different experience than any I've had. It allowed me a small peek into 'Jewish' dining..  I had matza ball soup and knishs...very very greasy. Good, but greasy.  Definitely not a health food place. And it wasn't cheap, but it was good deli, diner type of food. Sandwiches, fried stuff...meat...dessert. A nice, simple, and casual place to grab a bite!  What's great is that you see the deli and know it's all made there and then."}
{"text":"Came by to have a chicken salad bagel to compare with the Bagel House because the one closer to Yitz didn't have one on their menu. Tasty - sure but I wouldn't come back for fear of spending $11.something (after taxes) for a single bagel with chicken salad in it.  Maybe lower the price or offer a drink at least with it at that price point?"}
{"text":"I was introduced to this place through a friend during some Eglinton street adventures.  The place has me won over pretty quickly just from the sausage shaped door handles.  Despite being a sandwich guy, I'm not really a smoked deli meat sandwich kind of guy, so went off their dinner mains menu options and choose the Beef Ribs & Chicken Wing combo. This got me my choice of soup, the dinner with choice of 2 side dishes, and a piece of pie for dessert. Amazingly, this 3 course meal was only $16.95 plus tax.  My dining counterpart ordered a Sunday dinner roast beef special which I stole a bite of and couldn't help but think how good it would've been in some sort of sandwich form.   I'm not going to tell you the ribs or wings were the best or even of smokehouse quality, and I really have no experience to compare when it comes to the Matzo ball soup I started with, but it was all adequately tasty, and I will admit the blueberry pie I had to wrap up the meal was dynamite. The food was brought out quickly by our friendly server, and I washed it all down with an affordable bottle of Heineken for $5.50, making a 3 course meal with a beer come to only $26 after tax before tip.  3 star food... But 4 stars for portions, service, and all around value. And leaving so full that we caught a cab back out of the area instead of walking as planned, how can I say I'm not a fan of this place?"}
{"text":"Have a deli craving?  You can settle that here.   Great everything.  And -- deli service.  They're at your side when you need them but won't bug or rush you.   Fresh baked goodies at the front too.  I highly recommend the challah.  Unreal how fresh it is.   The funny part is they're located right beside Russell Oliver Jewellers.  I saw the man himself walking in one day LOL.  Try Yitz's.  One of the best delis in the city for sure!! MY HARD EARNED CASH FOR YITZ's PASTRAMI -- LOL"}
{"text":"This is a classic Toronto deli which remains consistently delicious for breakfast and lunch!   NOTE:  ... Yitz's Deli sells the best chocolate chip cookies in the city! They are not cheap, but are worth every single penny. They are soft and chewy and filled with huge, gooey chocolate chips. They are totally addictive ... be warned!"}
{"text":"Haven't been in a few years and things haven't changed much.  I asked for 'fatty' corned beef, but when it came it unfortunately didn't have a lot of fat.  Good flavour though. The latke was delicious.  My daughter had the cabbage soup and loved it.  We'll be going back again."}
{"text":"Having recently moved back to Toronto I am of course on the hunt for ... well favorite everything.. sadly this was not it.  I pass Yitz's every day on the bus and as it was a lovely day I thought I would hop off and pick up some treats... got some potato latkes and asked the BEST way to heat them... after giving me 5 options on how to do it  I once again asked what his recommendation would be for the best way to do it (as I assumed he would be an expert) as those were all the ways I knew I could do it but what was the best??  a blank stare was the reply... oooookay.  They reheated in the convection oven ok but were just Meh and needed some serious blotting to absorb all the oil that came out of them. Asked for some butter tarts as we all love those... well that was a major miss.  When we opened the bag we knew something was off immediately.. they had that weird \"really old, kind of stale, maybe a little mouldy smell\" to them.  Tried a tiny bite to see if maybe it was the bags or if it was some strange spice smell but the crust, which may have been a shortbread style crust instead of a pie crust crust we decided that that was definitely the source of the weird smell  and although the filing, which was super sticky, was not super sweet (which was good) it could not overcome the smell so off to the garbage they went.   The hunt for a good bakery continues"}
{"text":"Our favorite deli in Toronto is nearly inaccessible because of construction.  Best to approach from the Avenue Road intersection on foot. Good luck!  Hope it is easier on our next visit."}
{"text":"Had the smoked meat (fatty) and a kishka. Both were great. Prices were fair and service was fast. Solid experience. The sandwich lacks the \"wow factor\" that you would get at Schwartz's but it is good and comes with free coleslaw that is great. Will return for sure."}
{"text":"I come here quite often either dine in, take out or just pick up some baked goods.  The is great and you can get a bang for your buck.  The only thing about dining in during the winter season is that you need to dress extra warm in there cuz there seems that they never have the heat on.  Also, if you seat in the back you will definitely feel a cold draft.  Besides that I really enjoy this spot ."}
{"text":"I treated myself to brunch alone today, and my visit to Yitz's was quite nice.  The bakery is at the front when you walk in, with what seems like millions of pies, cookies, and pastries on display.  You can also order take-out sandwiches and salads at the front, or you can proceed to the back, where the surprisingly large dining room is.  No waiting for a table here, even on a Sunday just after noon.   On Saturdays and Sundays, they have a brunch menu, which I ordered from.  I had pastrami and eggs, served with rye toast and home fries.   Piping hot, tasty, and a very reasonable sized portion.  Service was good - my bottomless coffee was refilled when necessary.  I declined the server's offer of lemon pie for dessert (as tempting as it was) and tried two of Yitz's popular chocolate chip cookies.  A great accompaniment to the rest of my coffee!  At $15 (plus tip) for brunch, coffee, and cookies, the prices are reasonable although not rock-bottom."}
{"text":"Taking a class all-day on Saturdays, to put it bluntly, sucks. As a result, I enjoy treating myself lunch every week. My classmates and I decided to go to Yitz's today as I HAD many fond memories of coming here with my grandfather and listening to his same stories a trillion times.   We had forty-five minutes to eat lunch, which SHOULD have been ample amount of time.  Well...  all of us mostly ordered matzah ball soup and/or smoked meat sandwiches. Both these things do not take long to make and are perfect selections for people in a hurry... so we thought. The service was extremely slow in spite of us informing the staff ahead of time that we only had 45-minutes.  Prices are quite high considering the amount and quality of food you get. I ordered the matzah ball soup and cabbage roll .... the matzah ball soup was mediocre and pretty small considering it's almost five bucks. The cabbage roll was almost seven dollars and the cabbage was burnt.  I'm sure there's a chapter covering this in the textbook for hospitality school, but... we had to move seats and then had to sit in an awkward area with about 10 little kids running around. The lunch was not relaxing to say the least.   There are so many amazing delis in places like New York and Montreal; it's a shame that the \"authentic one\" in Toronto is Yitz's."}
{"text":"Nothing cements your single status as a semi-young Catholic woman like sitting in a Jewish deli alone over fried latkes and listening to Dido's \"Thank you.\"   If you want atmosphere, it's definitely here from the frankfurter-shaped menu to the comics on the walls (they have to be from the 50s or 60s).  This was my first visit and I didn't have much so I can't fully judge this place.   Latkes were comforting on a cold night. But be warned: if you're sitting down, you have to pay a $4 minimum. This would have been nice of the lady at the counter to say something before I sat down instead of deciding to take home my latkes."}
{"text":"Opening a delicatessen in Toronto can be a mug's game. Caught between two of North America's greatest smoked, cured meat centers in Montreal and New York, just about every Toronto deli pales in comparison.   Both Montreal and New York boast their own deli styles and cultures. You may go for the pastrami/corned beef concoctions named after Woody Allen or featured in Rob Reiner movies, or you may prefer the luscious fatty smoked meat of Mordecai Richler's youth. Either way you're biting into something much bigger than a sandwich. Toronto may have recently discovered all manner of charcuterie, but we're a new food town, especially when it comes to the heavy, meat-laden meals that our grandparents preferred while we opted for cookstown greens and artisan goats cheese.   There are some delis that have withstood the test of time. Our family frequented Yitz's on Avenue and Eglinton. The happy yellow sign and vintage comics/songbooks posted along the wall promised the kind of salty meat-goodness that growing palates love. Lightly charred hot dogs, sweet crisp cole slaw, and best of all, their own fries. Today, I'd compare them to loonies in size and color, but I'm old enough to remember when paper money actually mattered.   Yitz's has recently fallen on hard culinary times. Several years ago Mr. Yitz hung up his red socks (I now have several pair myself, as an homage), and sold to a new owner. The food took a dive in consistency and quality, leaving me to wonder about the glowing reviews here and the state of deli in our fine city. A negative review in the Toronto Star confirmed my opinion; the corned beef was dry and texturally unpleasant.   Still, it's close, and as a family favorite deserves a visit, at least once every few years. On this occasion, it was an unexpected pleasure.   We start with soups; the special is yellow pea. It's rich, thickened with noodles and legumes. The peas are nicely melted, not chalky, and complimented by generous chunks of carrot. We forgo the usual matzo balls, which we find mushy, and order the new kreplach soup. The broth is made by a secret process that involves waving a chicken over the pot while dropping chicken base into the water itself, but the kreplach are light and well-seasoned. My inner five year old approves.   My favorite part of the evening is the beef knish which arrives next. Long before a certain Mr. Caplansky began stuffing smoked meat ends into every item on his menu, Yitz blended his product into his beef knish filling. The result is addictive, super-savory meat inside a crispy crust. You can have it with gravy, which appalls the New York and Montreal contingent at the table. Maybe it's a Toronto thing. In any case, it's unnecessary. Better to slather the pastry with some of Yitz's house-made extra hot mustard. The kind made with horseradish, which allegedly grows hair on one's chest.   Food arrives at a fast clip, presented by a disinterested server who spends half the evening getting chewed out by the owner at the next table.   A plate of french fries is inhaled by the table. They're round and ridged like they were when I was a kid, but they lack that consistent crispness that I remember. The last place I had fries like that was Katz's in New York. they were deliriously crunchy and puffy inside.   Sandwiches come warm, on rye bread that holds up to juicy meat. Corned beef is soft, salty, and tangy.  Pastrami is more robust, but lacks the subtle sweet/smokiness and unctuousness that comes with really stellar product. Add more extra hot mustard, and you'll weep with joy anyway.   At one point, Yitz's was kosher enough that you couldn't get cream for your coffee. Thankfully, they've amended this policy. You'll need it for the grey, lukewarm brew that's grudgingly slopped into our cups. As it sits, I'm reminded of Johnny Cash singing \"ain't no grave\". I don't know why.   Baked goods are fair; a trio of chocolate ruggelach meets the traditional requirement that you take coffee or tea \"with a little something\". The best dessert on the menu, a towering tart lemon meringue pie is not available. It's a shame, but I'm full, and for one evening anyway, reminded of why we came here so often."}
{"text":"I am being a little unfair! I hardly have any smoked meat sandwiches in Toronto.. and my last Deli sandwich experience was in NYC.. and in comparison eating at Yitz's was such a disappointment!!   Luckily I was here at Yitz's when they have weekday lunch specials!! For $9.99, choice of soup and a sandwiches/salad/burger...   Matzo Ball in Chicken Soup and Pastrami Sandwich  - The Matzo ball itself was ok.. (not like I am an expert on that, but I ate the whole thing!) The soup based itself tasted like something from campbell..Canned soup... I don't expect them to make everything from scratch.. but tasted like canned soup..which I am an expert in!  - Pastrami was dry... the bread was dry... the smoked meat like what I get from supermarket too..........   I feel like I was eating my own cooking at home instead of eating in a restaurant... Can you say that Yitz's has a homey feel in a bad way?  Waitress here were really nice and friendly.....wish the food would be better!   They accepts all credit cards!"}
{"text":"Life quest: to find the perfect matzo ball soup. IMHO, there are two criteria: the soup, and, the matzo ball(s).  At Yitz's, the soup is excellent. It must be made in house. Its hot, fresh and refreshingly real. Not a hint of canned content.  The matzo ball, (singular) is firm, but not too firm, and displaces the \"right\" amount of soup when lifted out of the bowl. The weight is spot on. My one concern is that perhaps, for some people, it may be just a bit too salty.  I've included a photo of the daily lunch time specials.  Today, a Tuesday, I had the soup with wiener and beans.   I asked the waitress about the wiener and beans and she said that if I like \"cook out\" food, I'd love it.    Being an avid camper type ... I loved it."}
{"text":"The best place for some good smoked meat sandwiches and delicious hearty soups, Yitz's is a great place to eat and to stock up on their famous soups, baked goods and other foods all available pre packaged. My favorite tidbit about Yitz's is the amazing menus they have which are in the shape of a sandwich on rye. Classic!"}
{"text":"I find it difficult to locate a good kosher meal in Toronto, which is odd given the large Jewish community.  Montreal, in comparison, is a kosher bonanza!    My favourite part of Yitz's are the doors - when you walk in you're greeted by a sausage door handle.  I mean come on!  Can you get more awesome than that?!    I have only ever come here for gefilte fish and matzoh ball soup.  The gefilte fish seems pretty standard issue and they give you a GYNORMOUS chunk of it.  The matzoh ball soup is perfect for a winter day, and the chunk of matzoh is huge - but my complaint is about the soup, which tasted like they just used some Knorr soup mix.  Prices were not exorbitant, but they were probably 15-20% higher than they needed to be.    We came here on a Saturday evening around 8PM, there were a ton of seats.  The staff were attentive, but where we were sitting (at the back of the restaurant) was super cold.    I suspect that Yitz's is now just coasting on their reputation as the go-to kosher place in North Toronto despite not having great quality food - it looks like there is some room for a tastier challenger."}
{"text":"We haven't eaten food but have stopped by to get deserts and fresh pastries. Prices are a bit expensive but you are getting the home cooked/baked feel you would hope for.   It keeps us going back!"}
{"text":"You should see the matzos on this place. Huge. They don't give a crap about anything, aside from how they're all up in your soup taking up all the space, like a fat guy in a hot tub.  The ambiance is fairly sterile and they randomly have a cigar shop inside, but they make a mean sammy. Smoked meat on fresh rye with mustards on the table? What more can you ask for! And at under $10 with a soup at lunch, it's a steal.   PUZZLED PEPPER: Seriously. Those matzos are too big for the damn bowl. Why not get bigger bowls?"}
