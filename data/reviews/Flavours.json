{"text":"We were regular customers of this restaurant throughout the changes of different owners (always remained Caribbean food) and am so happy to say that the new owners have nailed it! The menu is a good size. Not too big so as to have to question freshness and quality, and not too small for variety. Classic and most popular dishes are there. The oxtail is perfectly spiced, the goat curry is perfectly tender. I prefer their rice to most other places and have never found it over cooked or mushy. They also spend a little extra time garnishing your meal with a sprinkle of green onions before serving- it's the little things that count. They have continued to make home made patties which are delicious! We try to keep our freezer full. Prices are fair and reasonable. I'm really rooting for this place. I can't wait for the delicious drumpan chicken in the summer. Well done Flavours!"}
{"text":"I really like the new menu. It's a great mix of comfort food with carribbean flavours. The pricing is average considering the smaller portion sizes. 

The homemade beef patties are very tasty but more fatty than other brands. The lobster doubles are made with a very nice crunchy flatbread with a tasty curry however don't expect to get more than a few small bits of lobster. The jerk shrimp Mac and cheese was very unique; it's creamy and rich with a bit of jerk heat (but disappointingly it's cooked with tiny low Grade shrimps). The jerk chicken was authentic with a great smoky grill flavour. The rice and peas were a bit dry. 

Overall, I would recommend this place for quick casual dine-in or take-out."}
{"text":"Amazing Caribbean flavours. So good, I can't even. I love how the takeout is served in cute boxes rather than styrofoam or plastic. The jerk chicken is so savoury and smokey and yet it is moist and falls off the bone. The rice and peas with oxtail gravy is perfect and you can taste the fresh spices and scotch bonnet. The plaintain tastes like dessert and the slaw is so freshly made as if it was picked from the garden and tossed. I think of mama's cooking. Can't wait to go back and taste the other offerings! So glad this place exists."}
{"text":"Went to this place on a whim and SO glad I did! This place is clean, the staff are friendly and the food is AMAZING!! The vegan meatballs are the best I have ever had! My fiance got the coconut shrimp and the crispy cod and he said it was by far the best coconut shrimp he's ever tasted. Crispy cod was delicious. Went back again last week and tried the jerk mac and cheese and the jerk chicken dumpling. Unreal! Everything tastes so homemade. Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"This caribbean fusion style restaursnt was very unique, upbeat and clean. What set it apart from the other places around town was the very affordable prices, the menu wasn't over crowded and it had nice caribbean canadian blend.

I tried the jerk shrimp mac N chz with a jerk and oxtail dumplin and my only regret was not sitting in to enjoy the full experience. And to top it off the owners are very welcoming. I will definitely be recommending this place."}
