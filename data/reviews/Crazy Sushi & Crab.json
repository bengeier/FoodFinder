{"text":"This place has quickly become a favorite for me and my friends. We love sushi ans this is by far the best sushi spot in the area for quality, quantity (big portions), variety, and prices. The new menu with the all you can eat option for $20 is well worth the price if you plan to eat a few different items which includes appetizers, soups, nigiri, and dessert on top of a variety of rolls. 

I highly recommend trying the takoyaki and seasame balls from the appetizer menu. My fav nigiri there is the eel which is some of the best eel and eel sauce I have had. I love the dragon rolls here as well for the same reason as it is topped with eel. The baked rolls were a unique option I had not seem before and had to try. The dynomite and firecracker rolls are soooo good. The rolls are bigger than in most sushi places too so you really get your money's worth. You will not leave disappointed nor hungry if you check out Crazy Sushi and Crab!"}
{"text":"This was the absolute worst sushi experience I have ever had. I thought they were going to arrest me for wanting to take the rest of my sushi roll home. I got the all you can eat sushi and they charged me 4 extra dollars to take 4 pieces of a roll home. This is absolutely ridiculous. I could understand if I was going to leave 4 untouched sushi rolls there, but I had literally 4 pieces of one sushi roll left and they charged me. Unbelievable. They would also not bring me anything else until I finished ever single scrap on my plate. Not to mention our server was rude and unprofessional, and the customer service was atrocious. The sushi came out quick but the k-pop chicken I ordered came out cold and overcooked.

I felt like I was being scammed for money. I had already paid for my food and then they wanted to charge me an extra fee to take 4 pieces home. So I decided I would just leave the 4 extra pieces there and was told I would still be charged additional fees even if I left the extra on the plate, so either way you were going to be charged more if you had anything left over. Complete and utter nonsense. I will not be returning here and I will never recommend this restaurant to others. Such a ripoff and disappointment."}
{"text":"Solid sushi offerings with lovely presentations. The mackerel nigiri was excellent and fresh.  The restaurant is modern and stylishly outfitted, super clean and numerous flat screen TVs featuring everything from sports to reality TV shows. Several sake choices behind an elegant bar...the owner was very welcoming and concerned about our experience, checking on us periodically. 

Unfortunately, I worry about the location of this restaurant as it's not near a busy area and the prices might shy away the college crowd. I wish this restaurant longevity, however....you'll leave happy if you go :-)"}
{"text":"Very Delightful Expierience! Ask for the Nabeyaki UDON with your sushi! Great combo! They give birthday desserts for free! And they have like 16 Beers on TAP! 

They're drink menu is not finished yet, but look around the bar.. They have a Wide selection of drinks from Great Sakes to Kraft Beers! 

Amazing food and service! 

They will get even better as time goes by! Ask for Harry, I think he's the manager, His english is a bit broken but he's so sweet and nice! 

Beautiful Interior, a Great Fusion of Japanese, Irsish Bar, Korean Place! 
Mesa is going to be popping! 

New Drink Spot!"}
{"text":"I ordered a Groupon coupon for this restaurant. I was very happy to see that it was very contemporary and well-kept. the food presentation was excellent. The waiter was very helpful. The taste of food was better than average. I would recommend this place again."}
{"text":"Great food, great atmosphere. My wife and I had a great waitor and it made the evening enjoyable. All together a nice place for sushi."}
{"text":"We loved our visit to Crazy Sushi Crab! Excellent food, fresh sushi being rolled in the bar, and they had great crab specials running for new years! The owner came out and checked on us several times, and he was incredibly kind. A new favorite in our neighborhood. Don't miss this place, it's just south of Target on Longmore, across from Fiesta Mall."}
{"text":"Can't beat the lunch specials here! 2 rolls or a bowl for $10.99. I had the lobster bowl and it was amazing. Costumer service here was great too! Defiantly will be going back."}
{"text":"This place is nice and clean and very spacious for a sushi restaurant. We were seated right away and our waiter was extremely friendly and tended to our needs. 

The portion size was average unless you get the lunch special, then those rolls are much smaller. I have tried many sushi places and this wasn't my favorite but it wasn't terrible.

I don't think their prices are worth the quality of what they give you. Although the waiter was great and the restaurant clean, I won't be returning... There's other places I enjoy much more with better prices."}
{"text":"This used to be my family's favorite get together spot, my mom, sister and I would come Thursdays for the happy hour. The food was always great and the service was top notch, their servers seriously bust their ass. Then something happened and made them change their menu entirely. The beer I would get (Orion), the appetizer we would always get (pork belly tostadas) and my favorite roll  (yellow daddy) were no longer on the menu. Everything else I can get at another, closer, sushi place. The new menu has a great price but there are a bunch of rules and restrictions. All the reasons we would come to Crazy Crab Sushi are gone. It's a shame too."}
{"text":"Love this place and the all day happy hour specials on Sunday. I've been in here multiple times and will keep coming back. The seafood always tastes and smells fresh. Service is always on point. I almost don't want others to find out about this place and enjoy how low key it is."}
{"text":"I read all of their reviews and asked my son, who had just arrived to take me tie the best sushi in mesa.  I read and reread crazy sushi reviews for at least 2 months.  At my request I asked my son to take the two of us for a great sushi dinner
  We ordered both the salmon and yellowtail sushi.  It arrived with a slice of yellowtail wrapped in rice the size of yellowtail sushi was about the size of 6 grains of rice . The biggest disappointment of a piece of sushi in my entire life.  The sushi had no TASTE AT ALL.  

THE REVIEWS are not truthful according to my experience of 49 years of sushi tasting experience.  Please look at other restaurants for GOOD/EXCELLENT/FRESH SUSHI!! Sushi was indistinguishable from the rice.  TRUE DISAPPOINTMENT."}
{"text":"Amazing!! Never had mozzarella cheese deep fried on top of my sushi but it was amazing!! The staff is very nice and personal! Place is huge and they rent it out for private parties. 10/10 !!"}
{"text":"Sushi was great. Service was quick and very friendly.  Will definitely return. It's our new favorite sushi place."}
{"text":"This place was great! Seriously good sushi, large menu with lots of options. Friendly staff, great environment and cool interior. The only downside is the price is slightly high but not enough to stop us from going. Just not as often as we would like. Highly recommend!!!!!"}
{"text":"Went here for a business dinner very good food and very inexpensive Thursday they offer 30% off menu great place highly recommend."}
{"text":"I was their 1st customer, and have been in contact with them pre-opening.  We live nearby and have been in there several times since their soft opening last month. From the gate they have been a winner!  Edamame, tempura, and carpaccio:  all excellent.  Their King Crab legs are a knockout.  The Mrs. cannot eat seafood and they created a bbq rib sushi roll for her-totally unique and delicious.  She also loves both their chicken and pork katsu.  I saved their best for last: the sushi is 5 star.  The rest of my family lives in Scottsdale and I have been to all the trendy sushi bars there; the sushi chefs here are the equal of anyplace, anywhere I have been to. Start with the sushi platter and go from there.  Since moving to Mesa from Honolulu  many years ago , I never thought that I would find food like this in my backyard! The cherry on top is the wonderful staff, they treat you like family.  I'm leaving now to get a bento box for lunch.  See you there!"}
{"text":"I been here several times with my friends and the food is amazing! I had most of the kitchen menu and rolls. they were all delicious. Especially all the kitchen menus are my favorite. I had a king crab one day and it was very tender and soft. Also, my favorite place to eat don-katsu. I would definitely recommend this place to my friends!"}
{"text":"Amazing new gem of a sushi spot right down the road. Excellent service. Amazing food, good prices. Nom nom nom"}
{"text":"The four stars is because they try hard.  The food quality and taste can improve drastically.  If you know authentic Japanese and Korean food, you'll know what I mean.  They are fairly new, therefore, they may improve.  They certainly try hard."}
{"text":"I really love this place. The food is so tasty, it has a great atmosphere and really nice pricing during happy hour times and the staff is very friendly. It's a nice treat to go here to eat. It hasn't been busy while I've been there. Very slow actually, though it is newer. Regarding slow traffic, it seems like they expect it to be that way, so their availability at the front isn't there. It seems to be based on if they notice you, but like I said, they are extremely pleasant! Other than that, everything is really nice. The baked volcano roll is a favorite! And another little something: I love their teapots! 
I hope more people start discovering this restaurant and that the service speeds up a bit for people coming in."}
{"text":"First time here, ordered the Chicken Teriyaki Bento boxes and California rolls, both were awesome and pretty good sized portions!"}
{"text":"We went there driving 40mins to eat jajang noodles. As soon as we ordered, the food came instantly. They were not hot at all both noodles and jajang sauce. It tastes stale something sitting next the kitchen for a long time. Only quarter of menu was available and no draft beer. I didn't finis mine and both my fiancé and I were sick after eating. Don't waste your time going there for any Korean Chinese dishes. Don't waste your money on stale food it isn't even hot. We both got really sick that night-it wasn't happy Friday night"}
{"text":"What can be said about this place? when the service is great the food is amazing so far my favorite restaurant."}
{"text":"All you can eat is Thursdays only now.  Food was good but a bit pricey.  More than I wanted to spend going in there.  Still searching for good AYCE sushi on east side."}
{"text":"Wonderful chef! The food is innovative and dedicate. Tastes amazing. We use Groupon and I feel so lucky to walk into this restaurant. I will go with my friend again."}
{"text":"My exprience at this restaurant was excellent. The sushi was great and a server Daniel was very very very nice as well! I strongly recommend this place! :)"}
{"text":"We walked into the door, stood there for a coiple of minutes and walked right back out. This place was not busy one bit.  We had multiple people that worked there look at us and not ask us if we needed help or to be seated. I saw great reviews and was  very disappointed when I walked in there."}
{"text":"New favorite, top three favorite and absolute best sushi I've ever had.  Just wow!!"}
{"text":"Sign outside says \"sushi and crab\", but it turned out it's Chinese-Korean restaurant, called Song San Chinese Cuisine. We came Saturday for lunch. Service was so-so, typical mom-and-pop Korean place where we need to flag if we need anything. Just don't set high expectation on service. All menu items were not available and and the ones available were rather expensive. We ordered braised chicken, seafood noddle soup, and shrimp fried rice (the only one they had despite what's in the menu). When food came, portion was huge. No wonder it's rather expensive. Food was flavorful and tasted good. A lot of leftover to take home. Not sure if they're new, but receipt says \"Sushi & Crab\". The sign on menu threw us off, it says \"18% gratuity will be added to any party\". It wasn't."}
{"text":"Last night was the first time I had ever been to this restaurant. We went for the all you can eat sushi. 
     We were greeted by Aaron, our server, who was holding the door open for us. He sat us right at the sushi bar where Luis was ready to make whatever we wanted. 
     We had about 7 rolls and 8 pieces of Nigiri. Everything was fresh and delicious. Luis was friendly and impressively fast in preparing the rolls. 
     I highly recommend this place, especially for the AYCE special, and the great customer service."}
{"text":"We went back for a second time; it was SO MUCH better than the first!  Service was much improved and again, the quality was excellent!  Yes, we will go back again!"}
{"text":"I love sushi so when I saw this all you can eat sushi voucher on Groupon i was super excited!! This was my first time here and i was super impressed. The guy that I saw at first to show us the way wasn't too personable but our waiter was awesome and friendly!

It wasn't too busy when i went. It was around 1pm on a Friday. Food came out fast and everything was really good! You just order as you go and you gotta gauge on how full you might get cuz they say will charge if you have too much leftover. 

Overall, sushi isn't over the top, but definitely still good sushi! For the price of the buffet, you can't beat it. Might come back in a couple months as I live in the West Valley."}
{"text":"We bought the Groupon for the endless sushi and it was delicious! The lunch was a steal with the Groupon and would be worth full price for all the food we enjoyed. Usually these 'all you can eat' places want you to fill up on fast bleh sushi and get the heck out! not here! You could clearly see the thought and care in this food. 

Pros: 
They present each course in order which I really enjoyed. Gave me a chance to really enjoy each dish before moving onto the next. 
Each plate was presented beautifully. You could see the Chef really took care to make each dish perfect.
Here's what I got:
Seaweed salad - perfect start to the meal
Jalabomb - crab stuffed japapeno, deep fried with mayo and teriyaki on top. The jalapeno was still fresh and crunchy. perfectly indulgent. ORDER THIS!
Firecracker - tasty spicy roll! loved the fresh jalapeno on top
High - came with escolar which I had never had before - fun fact: this fish has been banned in several countries! :X it was delicious
Mochi Ice Cream - Vanilla was meh but the green tea was perfection
Chocolate cheesecake - this was served WARM with a raspberry drizzle that was SO GOOD! I've never had cheesecake warm and that's a darn shame. It was amazing!

Cons:
Waited 5 minutes standing next to the \"wait to be seated\" sign to be finally told that we could sit anywhere.
Waited 10 minutes for the waiter to get to us to say hello.
Waited 10 minutes to bring us the menu and explain how to order.
I think he was the only server but it was excruciating because we were so hungry!
No sashimi, (only nigiri) so if you want the fish, you have to eat the rice too..

Neither Pro nor Con: 
Lunch took an hour and a half which was enjoyable to be together but it was not a quick lunch!
They make you clear your plates before ordering another 'round' so if you want to order 10 different rolls to try a bite of each, they won't let you be wasteful like that. (I'm in favor of this policy and they tell you before your meal.) I saw them enforce this rule at the restaurant which I think it completely fair. They don't want to waste time/food/money making these amazing rolls just to have a patron take a bite and move onto the next."}
{"text":"Wow... Im not to much of a sushi guy but decided to have a date night with my wife and saw yelp reviews for this place... Its super close and walking distance!! Very great atmosphere,  very ( and I mean very) attentive service!! We went for reversed happy hour, and to our amazement, we were basically the only customers there!! Hense the attentiveness... We ended up getting served by Paul and John who suggested a few appetizers and drinks to start off with... $2 PBR all day!! Everyday!! Great deal, but NOT my type of beer so I had the Kiltlifter for $3.50 a pint, which isnt a bad price at all... My wife had the Vegas roll and I had a Dynamite roll... Awesome portions for the happy hour deal!! We ended up not sharing because of my Avocado allergy. (I know yelpers, an allergy to avocado sux, BIG ONE)... The rolls were fantastic and I never expected to get the amount of food we got for the price we paid!! Kudos to Paul and John for a Great time, and great service!! Awesome prices, we paid less then $40 for 2 people!! The only down side was the amount of up-selling they were trying to do, probably because of how slow it must have been... We WILL be back though!!! My wife and I really, really loved it!!!"}
{"text":"Stopped by on a Friday night, the place was fairly empty.  I can tell the waitress is new, they got our order wrong.  Brought us food without utensils or wasabi.  I had to ask for it upon her return to bring us soup and salad.  Food was okay.  Teriyaki is not brown as expected, and it was on the sweet side.  Sushi was alright, nothing special."}
{"text":"I used to rave about this place all the time when it first opened it was so good! The food was great the people were very friendly! But the attitude of the servers has changed! They're not polite you can just tell they don't care! It's now named something else but still same crappy service and crappy attitude.. don't recommend this place at all anymore!"}
{"text":"Go to another sushi buffet!  Too many restrictions. They won't let u order anything new until your plates are empty.  One piece of sushi left on the plate.  Nope, u have to finish EVERYTHING before u can order dessert.  No wonder the place is empty."}
{"text":"I saw that this place was about a mile from my house so I thought that I would give it a shot.  The sushi was good and the prices were fair.  The establishment itself was clean, cool, and comfortable.  The place felt updated and modern - lots of TVs, nice decor, good colors, etc.  The waitress we had was excellent!  Very kind, spent time going over the menu, made sure to stop back and check on us.  The owner also made a point to come by the table a couple times and make sure we were doing ok.  Overall it was a good experience and I look forward to going back again soon!"}
{"text":"Don't be fooled by the vacancy-- this place has some of the best tasting and highest quality sushi that I've ever tried. The staff is efficient and the menu items are creative and unique. The happy hour deal is a total steal too. Try the garlic crunch roll."}
{"text":"Not coming back here. Went on a Friday afternoon, had their lunch special and it was awful. Presentation was bad, tasted cheap, price was expensive. I've had cheap buffet sushi before and that tasted better than this place. Don't waste your money here. Way too expensive for what it is..
It did seem clean, but our waitress wasn't knowledgeable about the menu at all. It seemed like this was her first job (probably was), but had no communication skills and didn't really pay attention. There were only 2 tables in the entire place including us and I over heard the other table get their order wrong.
Also, my boyfriend and I got sick after eating here. Not food poisoning sick just that the fish was definitely not fresh."}
{"text":"Hmm..... Used to be good... Maybe only for today... Too oily and even staff not friendly... Won't be back any more....."}
{"text":"This place was amazing!!!! Great customer service from our server Aaron and the manager! It is locally owned, so please support them! #shoplocal The manager informed us that they purchased the whole plaza! Mesa, lookout! They'll have a market, restaurant, and nail shop!!! Very impressed with their food!"}
{"text":"We wanted to try a new sushi place and this one was recommended. Honestly it is was good for the happy hour prices. I really liked the golden cali and golden lobster roll. Food was fantastic. I'll definitely be back for it. The service could've been better. The only thing that bothered me was we were waiting for the check for a while. During which all the employees were just at the bar area talking."}
{"text":"Wasabi!!!   They make fresh wasabi & it is worth the extra $1.50.  The dragon roll was good, not great. As was the Philadelphia roll.  The salmon sashimi was very good but cut a little too thick. But add that wasabi & it was amazing."}
{"text":"This really is a great place! I have tried many different sushi places around the east valley and this is becoming one of my favorites! The staff is pleasant but new (not necessarily a bad thing) and they will accommodate for different ingredients if requested. I asked for less cream cheese and masago atop my philly roll and it was the best I've had in a long time. Sure it's your average beginners roll, but if you can do something simple, and make it good, that's a challenge. A group of four of us went in just a week ago and they had Christmas carolers (que the fa ra ra ra ra jokes) Might seem odd for a sushi place but it was inviting and they were great singers. We have been ordering the salmon roll and it is also delicious, as well as the rainbow, Las Vegas and California roll! If you want to try something new, I suggest going here!"}
{"text":"Best sushi I have had in Phoenix! We came for the all you can eat sushi lunch. The service was fast and the rolls were amazing. I would come here again for sure!"}
{"text":"I love the all you can eat sushi amazing concept only thing and I like this idea is you only get two items at a time and that's mainly for waste  cost if u don't finish. I come almost every week and love this place. The buffet is about 20 bucks a person but worth it theirs a variety of items to choose."}
{"text":"Had an excellent happy hour/late lunch with a colleague. Everything we tried was excellent, and I was excited to see they had Orion beer from Okinawa."}
{"text":"Awesome meal, especially for the price.  We had the all you can eat sushi, and it was amazing.  Our server was also incredibly attentive and the food came out fast.  Will definitely do this again."}
{"text":"I love sushi and this place looked really good so when a really good groupon came up I couldn't resist. The place was basically empty upon entering and someone took us straight to a table in the bar area (we were with 2 children). The waiter seemed friendly taken our drink order quickly. We ordered spicy cali reg cali, Las Vegas, spicy tuna. The sushi it self was not very good had better at a buffet before. Just was not very flavorful. After we got our food waiter disappeared to never be seen again lol. Never checked in on us we had to flag him down. I will not be going back even if it was 1/2 off lol. 13_17 dollars for a roll is outrageous especially when it not good."}
{"text":"Place was decent, however it was weird setup as soon as you walked in! No one was standing at the hostess stand and there was no body really to be seen except for the bar area. Otherwise it was decent."}
{"text":"The service was way above average and the meats were perfect, I had teriyaki beef and pork Katsu and my wife had the salmon. I have not had better at any price."}
{"text":"Disclaimer: This review for Song San only.

Hands down best Chinese-Korean food in town - so glad they re-opened! The original  1/2 of this restaurant used to be on Alma School/Knox. I brought my friend from California, and she said their kanpoong shrimp (deep fried shrimp in spicy/sweet sauce) is the best shrimp dish she's ever had. It's a bit pricey ($23.99), but you get whole a lot of delicious goodness.

It's an interesting set up with two different concepts co-existing in what I assume to be an old TGIF location, but the food and service are both great. It's a long haul from where I live, but it's totally worth the drive. Highly recommended to all those interested in trying this uniquely niche Korean flavor (the most popular dishes being jjambbong, jjajangmyun, and tangsuyuk) - you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"My sister and I stumbled across this place for lunch today and not am I glad that we  did!  The sushi was outstanding and the service was excellent. We did the all you can eat for 23 bucks and it was amazing value for money. You have got to give them a try. If sushi isn't your thing, they also have a traditional Chinese restaurant connected to it but the two restaurants are divided. Five stars. I'm telling everyone I know so they stay open for a long time!"}
{"text":"I was eager to try this place since all the reviews are really good. I arrived at the same time as a party of 8 did. The server got drinks and then shuttled food orders one by one to the POS computer. The server acknowledged me once but after 15 minutes of sitting at the sushi bar and never even getting a menu to look at it... while two sushi chefs and a man (I assume is the manager or owner since he had a fast food cup in his hand as he sat at the bar) ignored me... I left and will not return."}
{"text":"Really good rolls and excellent service, but keep note that they have a new, limited menu. 
I have wanted to go to this restaurant for a long time, based on a friend's recommendation. 
However, they have a new menu and most of the appetizing pics like crazy fire roll, lollipop roll, screaming o tuna and okie dokie roll are no longer available. 

I realize most of the pics here are posted by customers, but then the restaurant needs to have a website of what they have to offer. 

I like looking at pics of the food to determine if I want to visit a restaurant and it gives me an idea of what to order. NONE of the items I wanted to order were available. Since I was meeting a friend for lunch my only option was to order what they had from the menu. The rolls were ok."}
{"text":"My girlfriend and I have found a home away from home.  This place is very down to earth and indescribably friendly. We come every Sunday and are always blown away by the quality of fish and family friendliness we receive. If you like sushi, this is the place to be, if you love sushi and like making friends this is the place to be.  Service is always great or better and the food is always super fresh. Have yet to meet a manager or staff member that we didn't love. Thank you guys for making such an amazing experience for us that we have made frequenting your establishment a habit.  Thank you most of all to Paul (our server) for making us smile every week!"}
{"text":"First impression about crazy sushi and crab isn't pleasant. The Korean guy who looks like Kim Jong-un with salty and sour face is so RUDE!"}
{"text":"We went for happy hour on a Sunday afternoon. Our waiter was very friendly and the food was great. We ordered a couple different rolls. They also have some great beer specials!"}
{"text":"So delicious! I found a Groupon deal for the Sushi but would gladly pay full price for these amazing flavors! The service is perfect all though they were a little short staffed at first but that is to be expected when starting out. I anticipate many road trips to here. We live in Prescott Valley but would drive here for lunch anytime we find ourselves in the Valley!   Love it!"}
{"text":"Awesome food! Awesome service! We totally will go back. Try the pork belly tostadas and the spider rolls. Yum!!"}
{"text":"For ALL Sushi lovers!!! This is a must go to establishment. The Sushi is by far the best I have had in the valley in years!!! Forget about those chain sushi restaurants!! This place is the real deal!!! The Sushi Chef Josh is AMAZING!! The quality of the sushi is by far superior to any other Sushi restaurant I have been to. The wait staff is great! My family and I look forward to many years of patronage at this place!!! NOW STOP READING AND GO HERE IMMEDIATELY! YOU WILL NOT REGRET IT!!!"}
{"text":"Very good restaurant, sushi is fresh, and very nice place to relax.  I like the location although it's not on a busy street.  I didn't try the crab, but I saw it coming out to other customers and I plan to try it next time."}
{"text":"Dragon roll was amazing.  Service was average.  Vegas roll had far too much cream cheese, I felt like it was a fried cream cheese roll ."}
{"text":"defiantly recommended! My first time there was exceptional. the hostess was welcoming and very funny, he even came outside to greet us! The rolls were tasty and prepared quickly. I recommend the crazy fire roll and the crazy dragon. My family and I will come back next time we are in the area."}
{"text":"The service was fast and the waiter was very prompt, filling our drinks and getting anything we needed. The reason for the 3 stars and not 5 is for 2 reasons. One is the price being a little too pricey for what it is. We paid 60$ after the tip for 2 people. The sushi was way smaller than what we are used to and also it had a mushy texture. We ordered a lobster roll and 2 las Vegas rolls along with some chicken box with five and veggies. The food looked so good, almost perfect but to be honest it was very bland, all of it. The Spicy mayo literally tasted like normal mayo with very little added flavor. I gave it 3 stars because the waiter was very nice but I think I will not go back to eat. We can get the same sushi but better flavor at yogis grill for about 20$ cheaper."}
{"text":"This place has Chinese cuisine, sushi, crab, and much more! The food is top notch with great customer service! The interior design at this restaurant has a great vibe and the food comes out fast! Definitely want to go back to try the different dishes here. I had the black bean noodle and the lobster roll.  This might sound gross but it was a great combo! So excited to try the other rolls and the other Chinese dishes!"}
{"text":"Been here twice. Fast service, friendly staff, and very clean restaurant. Oh the sushi was awesome too!"}
{"text":"Really great food and awesome service! Me and my husband are not big sushi eaters so we had the Bento boxes...they were delicious. Loved it. Will definitely come back again."}
{"text":"CRAZY SUSHI CRAB! What can I say. This place is definitely  a hidden Gem in Mesa az. I recently purchased a home here and never thought I would find another sushi place then Sakana, which I will always love! I LOVE this place from the owner to the great staff! It has definitely made my home buying experience even more enjoyable to have a great sushi place right next door! If you live close by or in Mesa this place is a must stop destination :)! Can't wait for the many more experience s I'll have......keep you updated...:)"}
{"text":"I have to say I was skeptical. It's near Fiesta mall the parking lot was pretty empty. I'm so glad we decided to stay though!

The waiter was very good, prompt, and very polite.

The food took some time (even with only a few customers) but it was fresh, plated well, and has quickly become one of our new favorite locations. 

We ate the Yellow Daddy roll, the Love Heart roll (yummy!!!), and the Garlic Tuna roll (delicious!). 

We would recommend it and we WILL be back!!!!"}
{"text":"Wow! We had a good experience.  The atmosphere is very nice, very clean.  The service was excellent, our server was well groomed, and polite.  I was very impressed.  We had edamame, and I had the viva Vegas roll.  It was delicious.  Everything was fresh and tasty.  I will go back again and again."}
{"text":"I came Crazy Sushi Crab for their Korean Chinese food which was in Alma School before, so I didn't order any sushi here. Korean Chinese food was really good, but my biggest compliant is service. The young guy was so rude with angry face. He did not give us any menu when he was sitting us. He only told us the other Korean lady will take our order. After 10 mins, no one came to get our order and we still have no menu. We could not find any servers around Dine-In section. Another 5 mins, finally we found the Korean lady to get our order. ( We still did not have menu, so we just order same as usual.) She thought the young man got our order already 15 mins ago. Really! The young guy looked hate to work here. Hate to take care   customers. One star for yummy Korean food.  One star for the Korean lady. The young man talked so rude and looked really unhappy got 0 star."}
{"text":"Truly disappointed.  We went twice, the first time was so good we brought friends to try it and support this local business.  Unfortunately, the service was so bad the second time that even the good sushi could not make us feel better.  The worst part was they added 18% gratuity to our bills! (We asked for one bill, but were given 7.)  We were literally forced to tip very high for subpar service.  I think this is an outrageous practice. My husband and his associates were late returning to work since it took over 15 minutes for their food order to be taken, the waiter kept vanishing and had to be hunted down whenever we needed something.  No plates were bussed, no sodas we refilled, and our order was incorrect.  The manager did not make us pay for the food we didn't order, but even though we complained about the service, added the tip to all of our bills....the sushi is really good, but based on this visit, I won't be back, or recommend to anyone that they dine in.  Take out, sure!

I almost didn't post this review, but I felt so sucker punched by the addition of the tip, that I thought others should be warned.  They took off the 20% coupon and added an 18% tip for 10% service!"}
{"text":"Went again today and it was not as good.  The sushi chef Tommy was a real jerk.  His rolls were no where near as good as the last guy when I was here before.   So if you go and find that Tommy is the sushi chef, I would not recommend sitting at the sushi bar, and might even recommend you just leave."}
{"text":"They had the best sushi in the valley and impeccable service! Very clean. The owner is really sweet and after complimenting his business he hugged us and said I love you"}
{"text":"Fruit flies everywhere, slow service, forgetful waitress, mediocre sushi, advertised sapporo with saki bomber,  then said it only comes with dry asahi (which was gross).  1 waitress, 8 tables, overtalkitive manager, who should have helped her more and monitoring the quality of food, drinks being served and minimizing the fruit fly problem.  But he said he felt tired and lazy.  We dropped $75, and felt a little sick to our stomach afterwards... Coulda been the beer."}
{"text":"This place has some amazing potential...my wife and I wanted sushi but, didn't want to drive all the easy to Chandler to get to our usual haunt. 

Though pretty empty, the service was spot on and the food was pretty decent. This is a hidden gem and we hope the neighborhood will make an effort to support this newly opened joint."}
{"text":"It's a great place. Has potential.  They just need to elevate it a bit more. They have about 20 beers on tap lager,ipa's 'and Japanese beers. Sad thing is I walk in and the place is half empty. Grabbed a beer and ordered some calamari salad. It was good. Seems like the staff is struggling due to the competition on the area. This place has potential of whoever is making the decisions can get their head out there ass...next to a community college....elevate this place!"}
{"text":"Excellent sushi currently serving all you can eat for 23.00!! Quality rolls, excellent fish and light on the rice. Loved the service, which was quick and friendly, very attractive restaurant, nice music. Close to Banner Hospital & Cardons Children's Hospital."}
{"text":"I am so torn on this place!! I have been going here sometimes 2 to 3 times a week because we LOVE sushi and its right by our house, BUT they started changing things that brought us in. The happy hr was perfect for our family because our kids consume a ton of sushi just by themselves and then you have myself and my husband...it adds up quickly. We found this place to be a treat and that we could all enjoy ourselves and be full at the end of our meal without breaking the bank. I used to grip about how early they would close on Fri,sat and sun (which was when we would do reverse happy hr). Now they stay open till Midnight, but took away reverse happy hr!? Makes no sense. The reason it was getting so much business at night was because of happy hr. Needless to say we haven't been back since. Its certainly not because of the food. The food is great and we have never had anything bad. The Salmon is so good here. Buttery and delicious. 
I wish them the best and hope they stay  because we desperately need places in the Fiesta area. The building is also very strange, but I get it. They can't afford to remodel the entire place just yet. Hopefully in the future. I hope they go back to the old happy hr and get the service on point. It can be so crazy in there! The staff sometimes seems like they don't know whats going on are running around like chickens with their heads cut off. I have been apart of the service industry for years and so I just want to pull them aside and say relax!! The worst thing a server can do is when greeting the table tell that table about how busy and understaffed you are...which has happened several times to us. Get it together guys and you could have an amazing restaurant!!"}
{"text":"Honestly, we bought this $20 Groupon with a little bit of trepidation because it had \"Crazy\" in it's name.  Not sure why something like that would worry us, but we were happily surprised.

When we walked up from the parking lot, our server Aaron, greeted us as he opened the entrance door for us.  He asked us if we preferred low top or high top and took us into the upper leave aka the bar. He informed us it was happy hour so we ended up with 2 checks and 2 tables. (Yep one for the adults and one for the kids. ) We split checks for our $20 Groupon and one for all our happy hour items.

I rarely give five stars so let me start by saying not only was the service great but the food was out of the world."}
{"text":"Everything we have had is delicious. The dynamite roll was fabulous and we are so excited to have a new sushi place in the neighborhood."}
{"text":"The service is absolutely terrible at this establishment. You can tell that they don't train their waiters, at all, and they can't even say what is included in each dish. The restaurant wasn't that packed during the lunch hour and yet they were acting as if it was a full house. They were rude when our table asked for a condiment and at one point was talked down to. The managers and owners should be embarrassed about their quality of service. I have never been so repulsed by a dining experience."}
{"text":"I had high hopes for this place. It's about a 5 minute Drive from where I live, and I was excited to have a good sushi restaurant nearby my place. When I got there it was pretty empty for lunch. The food was good, nothing outstanding. Realized no silverware, had to ask for chopsticks/silverware after food was brought out. Our server overall was not attentive, slow, and seemed annoyed at any requests that were made. Advice to management-you don't have to have 5 star food if your service is 5 star. Food was 3 star with 1 star service, so 2 star rating. It's been a few months and I have not been back, but I may give it another try one day."}
{"text":"After attempting to stay away from fish for a while so I don't poison myself with crazy Mercury level, I caved. Lol However, I don't think I've ever been so disappointed leaving a sushi place as I have with this place. It was mediocre at best. Not worth the price that they charge. Presentation is lovely but we probably should have known better from looking around. At dinner time in a large city to have just three tables in the restaurant was a sign. Never again."}
{"text":"Sushi isn't cheap no matter where you go unless you hit a place with a luncheon special.  Having said that, this place makes pretty good sushi but they need to work on their service.  When we came in the young lady at the front desk seated us and then went off to get our drink order.  I noticed that the entire time we were there no one manned the front desk and one guy came in and stood there for the longest and almost left if he hadn't gone into the bar to ask for service.

Their hearts are in the right place but they really need to learn how to run things smoother.  We got hot tea from one girl without a lid.  She said she couldn't find it - really? But when our server came back she noticed it and went to get us another pot that had a lid.  My GF and I each ordered miso soup and upon noticing how good it felt to our dry throats they kept bringing us more - score!

They kept us in tea until we were floating and we each had two rolls which were yummy.  I was disappointed that they didn't have white tuna nor a fish/avocado combo.  They did make me a salmon avocado roll but I had to pay 50cents extra for it.  They do have some really creative rolls which my friend tried but I stuck with my basic rolls.

I'd come back but they really really need to work on running the business more efficiently.  That may cost them in the end."}
{"text":"Don't just look....Go in and see!! This is my new go-to sushi place.

Like others, I was a little skeptical walking in because the restaurant is in the Fiesta district, and the area surrounding the mall is beginning to dwindle. However, I knew the the restaurant was fairly new, and it was very early for any kind of dinner rush. But we were hungry, and rather than drive all the way across the Valley, we decided to give it a shot. And I was glad we did.

I am not blown away very easily, but when I walked in, it shattered all my expectations. The place is very nicely decorated. The bar is warm and inviting, and the wait staff matched. We were greeted warmly and quickly. We sat in the bar area, which is modern, elegant and classy. The room has a liquor bar on side, and you may also sit at the sushi bar on the other end across the room. This would be a great place for an office lunch, meet the girls for lunch, take a client out, first date, 50000th date, or just walk in casual. The whole restaurant is tastefully decorated, but nobody goes to a restaurant because of how it looks, right? It's all about the food.

OMG the food! Asian restaurants seem to have caught a bit of Mexican Restaurant syndrome these days, where there are so many, but their either generic everybody is trying this and fusion that, and we lose a lot of the integrity and authenticity of the flavors, offerings, and culture. Crazy Sushi & Crab brings back everything that Japanese cuisine should be, and the food not only tastes good, it has the looks to match. Our teriyaki beef bento box was served in a beautiful red and black ceramic box. The beef was cooked medium rare and was tender and juicy and melted in your mouth, which was really surprising because A) Japanses beef teriyaki is usually tough and chewy; and B) non-steak cuts of beef are usually tough and chewy (restaurant-ly speaking). The teriyaki was light and aromatic, but full of flavor, as if it was part of the meat itself. The presentation was delicate and highly visual both in color and shape. For me personally, I have never met a pot sticker that I liked. It's just not my thing, but this box came with two of them, so, of course, I tried one.....and I liked it! And we came to the conclusion that maybe there are foods we don't like because we've never had them prepared properly. In short, I ate BOTH pot stickers and didn't share, even though they weren't mine to eat in the first place. I had the Yellow Daddy roll and the Vegas roll and I was not disappointed with either. The Yellow Daddy was light and feisty. It has a beautiful house specialty sriracha/cilantro sauce that I've never had anywhere else. It was spicy, and the cilantro goes up your nose the way it should, but it didn't overpower the fish. The Vegas roll was a more straight forward deep fried tempura roll. Their tempura batter is light and airy but cruchy and flavorful. It doesn't hide the food, it enhances it. It stayed crunch throughout the meal and didn't lose it's pop just because I took my time eating. In fact, they even have tempura battered sweet potato slices that came in the bento box that had us asking if they were available as an appetizer...it was that good.

My only regret is that I did not opt to sit at the sushi bar. I say this because another gentlemen was sitting there, and he was having quite the conversation about all the different fishes and flavors and sauces that were on the menu, and I wanted to go sit there and be part of that. As anyone who has had good Asian experiences will tell you, food is more than just fork to mouth, it's an experience....but not a missed opportunity for me. I have eaten a lot of sushi in my time, and now that this place is right around the corner from my house, I plan on eating a lot more."}
{"text":"This place was actually very good which I wasn't expecting based on the exterior and interior. They have the standard sushi rolls and some really interesting sushi as well. Things I've never seen in even higher class places. The sushi was fresh and robust. Good portions on the rolls as well. The service was very good. Our waitress was very attentive and so sweet, she always had a smile on her face. I highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"The best sushi place I have ever tried. I can't stress it enough. The sushi is great and the fish is great quality. They get new dhipments of fish every tuesday and thursday so come those days."}
{"text":"Great food, awesome pricing, good service!  Went on a groupon and got enough food to bring some home!  Delicious!  Will definitely be back..."}
{"text":"What huge portions and very tasty/fresh sushi!  I went here for lunch on a promotion and I was impressed with the large menu.  For $8 a heaping bowl of ramen noodles that should satisfy 2.  Your choices include pork belly or veggie.  I chose veggie and it was brimming with noodles, soup and an assortment of onion, chinese cabbage, mushrooms and corn.  Hot broth and chewy ramen, the way it was meant to be!  It hit the spot and I felt like I was in a real foodie restaurant.  Someone knows real ramen.  I got wide eyed at the HUGE/long rainbow roll.  For $12, it was double the size I'd normally get at another local Japanese restaurant.  I was torn between finishing the sushi or the ramen bowl....because I knew I couldn't walk out of the restaurant without clutching my stomach if I forced myself to finish both so yeah for leftovers.  The service was well attended and the ambience was just right with the flat screens and music.  There is a bar and dining tables all around.  I'd recommend this place as the best bang for your buck and for a unique menu.  It had regular sushi, deep fried sushi, katsu, seaweed salad, tataki and combo plates.  I'll be back to try other menu items!"}
{"text":"My favorite. I have been coming here since 2006 and I have my own chopsticks. The quality is amazing and the staff has been around as long as I have which says a lot for the service. Great place to come alone and eat or with friends!!"}
{"text":"Food was okay. We went during the lunch hour on a Saturday afternoon. Server wasn't really friendly and seemed in a big hurry to get our table over with  even though the place wasn't crowded. Will find another sushi place next time."}
{"text":"Absolutely fantastic. Wonderful staff, incredible and different rolls. You won't want to dip anything in soy sauce here. We've been going to the same sushi bar for many years, but we'll be going here from now on even though it's farther away. Definitely get the Yellow Daddy roll!"}
{"text":"Great food and fantastic service! I highly recommend the Crazy fire Roll! It's so spicy and delicious. The pork belly tostadas are also great! Good drink specials and overall a laid back atmosphere that makes you want to keep coming back."}
{"text":"Went for happy hour in the middle of the afternoon. Get their veg tempura ...excellent not too greasy. Also go the pork belly ramen--very tasty."}
{"text":"do not eat here beware beware beware
its terrible the people who give this five star are liars or they really have never had good sushi
over cooked rice
under cooked rice
chocolate on green tea ice cream???
 frozen cheescake?
cucumber with yellowtail ?
tuna was dyed 
calamari was frozen not fresh
wtffffff?
i am japanese this shit sucked soooooo bad"}
{"text":"Mediocre sushi. Nothing special. Its nice inside, service was good. I ordered fried calamari and they were mushy, the sushi was pretty bland."}
{"text":"Must try the Las Vegas roll it's sooooo delicious and the best I've had thus far from any sushi place. The waiter was super friendly and attentive not to mention the sushi chef Luis. They both kept asking if there was anything we needed and even reminded us that happy hour was about to end in 10 minutes so if we wanted to order and ha fed us the happy hour menu. Way to look out for your customers. I will be coming back for their all you can eat sushi and having plenty of the Las Vegas rolls which I'm serious it's a must try."}
{"text":"The most expensive  mid grade sushi I've ever had. It's empty for a reason. They don't tell you about e tea costs until your done and get a 150 dlr bill for teriyaki, 2 Maki rolls, mussels and 2 salmon rolls. 4 iced teas later 150 dlr bill. Completely unsatisfied. This Is theft."}
{"text":"Oh man... There are 12 previous reviews all 5 stars and I'm going to be the first one to not give it 5 stars. I feel a little terrible about it. Well, it has to be done so let's begin with the good.

The place itself was not bad. It had plenty of tables, space, good atmosphere, TVs to watch and it was clean. The bathrooms were very clean, and I hope they keep it clean in the future. And someone came by with water. Haha.

And I don't have anything too bad to say. Their sushi was ok. I had the tootsie roll and the cucumber eel roll which I thought were not worth over $6-$7 which would have led to 2 stars but like I said earlier... VERY CLEAN BATHROOMS. I definitely had better tasting rolls for less or the same price elsewhere. It just seemed mehhhhhh. Those were the basic rolls. The lobster roll was decent and around the average price but it seemed the roll was smaller than other restaurants.

So yeah! 3 stars to keep this place honest. I'm sure they will get better as time goes on. I mean, the sushi isn't terrible or disgusting."}
{"text":"If ever I have a favorite sushi place I would pick this restaurant any time. Crazy crab sushi is the perfect place to be. From the manager, Harry to their sushi chefs Jay and Josh - service is exceptional. Excellent food, clean restaurant, superb service. I can't say anything more. Hands down I want to be here all the time. Specially their happy hour menu - oh my God - you can't beat the quality and their prices. Give them a chance and I guarantee you won't ever regret it!"}
{"text":"Very large restaurant divided into three levels and a patio. The menu is extensive with many choices including bop bowls, udon and sashimi.  We had three different rolls: spicy salmon, tootsie roll and cherry blossom roll. The sushi was fresh, the rice was cooked perfectly and nicely seasoned and the presentation was very nice. Prices are quite reasonable with combination meals offered at lunchtime. The restaurant is very clean and the service is fast, friendly and informative."}
{"text":"I used to come here during happy hour, so I got excited about their Groupon for 2 for 1 all you can eat sushi. I guess that's all they have changed their menu to. No more draft beers and honestly the quality of the sushi went down...the Groupon was $27 for 2 people vs the regular price is $46. If I had paid that much for this bill I would be upset. The waiter was nice, but he brought refills of water before we even needed them or asked. I'm not complaining, but he seemed really frazzled with 4-5 tables in the bar area, and I had 5-6 glasses of water on our table of 2 people. Awkward.

I probably won't be back. Which is sad. I feel their location has really hurt them,  but in trying to save money their food quality has diminished. Nothing was bad. The food was good, it just wasn't delicious, and would be overpriced at regular prices in my opinion."}
{"text":"We dined in on a Wednesday evening and the place was already full with groups of guests. We were seated immediately by an overly excited waiter (he walked us in when we barely reached the door outside lol) and he accompdated us with the menu and drinks in a friendly manner. The place is quite big and has luxurious atmosphere with exotic props. We ordered pork cup-bop (fried rice with signature sauce), 2 orders of baked scallop rolls, las vegas rolls and yaki-udon and yes, that is too much food for two people but we finished all. Serving sizes are pretty good and two dishes and an appetizer would have been enough but we were very hungry and we eat a lot in general (like \"a lot\" a lot.) and all the dishes were delish! Will visit again for a nice dinner date."}
{"text":"The food was so delicious! The service was prompt and the staff was super friendly. Definitely recommend this place to anyone!"}
{"text":"I am sad.  I LOVED this place I gave them 5 stars...then... they changed the menu...not happy...one of my favorites were eliminated...but it happens right?  Then every time I went there they wanted me to walk up stairs into their bar to serve me.  (I had an auto accident in 2015 and can't go up stairs.  they were rude to me 3 times...I won't be back.)"}
{"text":"Love this place. Great prices. Be  sure to visit for reverse happy hour. Great sushi and sake prices."}
{"text":"Has WIFI GRRRREAT service, SUPER friendly staff, amazing prices, stellar TV set up, good sushi and the place looks pretty awesome. I WILL be making this place my new watering hole. See you there..."}
{"text":"They have many restrictions for Groupon.
1. No lunch menu
2. No happy hour menu
3. No special menu
3. No food to go, eat in only
Lots of No for Groupon customers.

One of my family member is house-bound, 
we were not able to bring food home and eat with him.
This \"no food to go\" for Groupon doesn't make sense to me."}
{"text":"Went in during a happy hour, had to walk up into the bar to get seated, don't stand out in the entrance and wait. Service was fast and friendly, way friendly. Between the three of us we had Teriyaki chicken, and a few sushi rolls to include the Firecracker. Food was great and the prices for happy hour menu items is nice. They're new but will most likely last."}
{"text":"I had heard great things about this place and finally made it in. The service was a tad bit slow, but very friendly and the sushi was to die for! Definitely my new go to sushi spot! We had the Crazy Fire Roll and the Love Heart roll along with some vegetable tempura. Sooooo good! All of it...delicious.  we will definitely be back. So happy to have found this gem!"}
{"text":"Tried repeatedly to give this spot a chance, but they don't care... the apathy toward paying customers is ridiculous."}
{"text":"Probably the best sweet shrimp I've had. This place is stupid big but every time I go in here, it's dead. The location sucks (I think the mall it's near is closing down). I've come here a few times only because of a Groupon though just because it's not that close to me. But their sushi is pretty darn good. I usually end up just sitting up at the bar. I've only ever had their sushi, has been good each time I've visited."}
{"text":"Great sushi. Very fresh! Sushi rice was done perfectly and sushi servings were generous. Had to poke tuna bowl and salmon nigiri. Fantastic!"}
{"text":"Absolutely amazing food !!!!! My girlfriend and I went to Crazy Crab and sushi . We had the garlic edamame , tootsie roll and finally the scrumptious Vegas roll all super amazing quality and an excellent value. We have just found out new go to favorite sushi place. I wish I could give this place 6 stars .



Amazing!!!!"}
{"text":"We visit the Chinese/Korean part of the restaurant as it seems to be the same as Sun Dining that closed some time ago and that we loved. The food is simply delicious! You can tell they do not overuse salt (and hence MSG). The food tastes natural, and is authentic. Prices are a little high at first glance, but portions are really huge. And, as I said, the quality is really superior. The only thing I don't like about this place is the male host. I am guessing the owner. He is rude. He walks around the place and throws things (I mean, he puts them away very loud. For instance, the cutlery). He gets emotional with customers, and doesn't even crack a smile. It's like he is mad all the time. Very poor service on his side. That's why 4 stars. But the waitresses are really nice. So, altogether, this place is a recommendable experience :)"}
{"text":"Review for Song San. We come here often to enjoy JaJangmyun and JJampong. Other main dishes are also very good. Be aware that they will give you so much that it would be hard to eat all of them. The taste and the quality of this restaurant has been up and down quite a bit. However if you really miss korean-style chinese food, this place serves its roll. Hopefully more chinese restaurant opens up in town and we would have more choices to choose from. :)"}
{"text":"This place is awesome! The service is spot on! Amazing how fresh the fish is for a desert town! Was told fish flown in daily. Spacious and worm atmosphere. Had a friend who is wheelchair bound with no arms or legs and they totally accommodated him. I have been to a LOT of Sushi restaurants and I have to say this is tops! Do not miss! Off Southern past Target so don't miss it!"}
{"text":"Great sushi , the interior is nice and modern 
Lots of tvs of your wanting to watch some sports
We will definitely come back"}
{"text":"Not very busy, but service and food was great.  Like others, we hesitated going in, but glad we did.  Happy Hour Sunday prices were very reasonable as well."}
{"text":"This is one of my new favorites. I have heard great things about the food and it did not disappoint. The sushi bar is worth sitting and drinking awhile. It's new and very clean. I will be back soon."}
{"text":"Not a huge sushi fan (was taking my son out to dinner and he gives them 5 stars) and the non- sushi menu is very limited. I would give them 3 stars due to that so I averaged. Had a noodle dish which was average at best but the service was good and the people who got the all you can eat sushi left VERY happy and full."}
{"text":"This is an awesome place for sushi. The service is very friendly. I sat at the sushi bar and had a great time. I can't remember all the items I had but I remember the crazy fire roll. It was amazing. There weren't any items that I disliked. Give them a try."}
{"text":"Great sushi. Was nervous walking in at 6pm on a weeknight, and it wasn't busy. Almost didn't stay. But was good. Great selection of specialty rolls. Good service at bar."}
{"text":"Tasty and budget friendly Sushi place.   A must try if you like sushi.  The place is not in an ideal spot.  Its off the main road near Fiesta Mall.  I'm afraid without more business they will close.  Which is a shame.  Our server was very nice and friendly and recommended items."}
{"text":"Sashimi was nice and cold, super fresh, and sliced perfectly! The Okie Dokie roll is a MUST and the Garlic Crunch roll is a close second fave. We've found our new go-to sushi spot in the valley."}
{"text":"Delicious. We were greeted and seated promptly. The server reviewed the specials with us. He was very prompt and kind. The food taste amazing! Great flavor and very filling. The atmosphere was amazing. After lunch the owner came to check in us which I appreciated. We will definitely be back"}
{"text":"Yum! What great service and amazing sushi. They have a variety of sushi to choose from! Awesome happy hour! If you haven't checked out yet you should"}
{"text":"We stopped by here for an early Valentine's dinner, feeling lucky it was pretty empty. We stood by the \"please wait to be seated\" sign for a while with no acknowledgement. Finally we sorted thru our phones for the other options in the area with the thought \"maybe they'll seat us before we decide on a second place to go\". We ended up leaving and going elsewhere."}
{"text":"This place was really dead the day we visited, I imagine because it may be a newer spot & hasn't had the time to scare up a healthy buzz. The sushi was really delicious. We tried miso soup with. A little on the pricier side and the server lacked a little confidence but otherwise made up for this lack in attentiveness. I enjoyed the quiet meaning emptiness. There was a nice mix of soft jazzy music & lover's rock reggae, which kept things upbeat. There were tvs all around though a bit awkwardly placed & playing nothing in particular. The decor & ambience is dark for daytime eating  - I would recommend late lunch or early dinner here. The atmosphere can be romantic or a fun group date but make sure to split the check..."}
{"text":"This place is great! It is very reasonably priced, very clean, and everyone who works there is extremely nice and cares about ensuring that you have a good visit. The Vegas roll was delicious, as was the salmon nigiri. I did not like the Alaskan roll as much as I had expected. My boyfriend and I are excited to return and try the softshell crab!"}
{"text":"We tried this place during their grand opening.  Food was decent and ok-priced.  They definitely need to work on their service.  They put us in an area away from all the other customers and forgot about us quite often.  It took me over 10 minutes trying to flag someone down for the check.  They also messed up my order.  I ordered the salmon and they gave me chicken.......At least they didn't charge me for the salmon price.  The order itself took a long time to come out, but they did recognize this and gave us a bowl of miso on the house.  We got 30% off our bill for the grand opening and a lifetime 10% off card.  We'll give this place a second shot once they work the bugs out with their staff."}
{"text":"Service was fast and friendly, food was great! There is a nice variety of sushi rolls, I recommend the garlic tuna speciality roll."}
{"text":"\"Who you tryin' to get crazy with ese? Don't you know I'm (sushi) loco?\"

Am I insane in the sushi brain? Maybe. I could eat possibly an ocean's worth of sushi. I certainly feel like I did so after eating here! How could I help myself after finding out that they have an all day happy hour on food and drink on Sunday? 

I shared a ton of food with my friends. Garlic edamame, sashimi, 2 happy hour rolls (Jalapeno crunch and Alaska), caterpillar roll, and ended our meal with a mochi triple threat (Green tea, strawberry, and mango ice cream mochi). 

The garlic edamame was awesome. It had a spicy kick with a pungent sauce that was perfect with the neutral taste of the edamame. Of all the rolls I enjoyed the caterpillar roll the most. It had a good amount of topping and filling, and all the components (Crab mix, avocado, eel with sauce) were well balanced together. The jalapeno crunch roll was a bigger roll, with a generous amount of fresh jalapeno, cream cheese, and crab mix with crispy crumbs along the edges of the roll. I wasn't too impressed with the Alaska roll, as there were pieces that had only the tiniest smear of avocado, and while I appreciate the creativity in adding some small thin sections of fresh lemon on top, I'm not sure I liked it in this particular roll. 

The sashimi was decent. It tasted fresh. Some of the slices were cut thicker than what I've seen at other sushi restaurants. Some of the sashimi had a bit of gristle still on them unfortunately. In general, they weren't as flavorful as other similar sashimi platters I've had in the past. For instance, my favorite sashimi fish, escolar, was in the platter, and it didn't have the rich, buttery taste of others I've had at different restaurants.

The wasabi they use here is odd. It is not spicy at all and is more like a lime green colored paste since it doesn't really have a lot of flavor. I placed a generous amount of it on a sashimi piece and bit into it and even then I didn't detect any kind of spicy kick.

The dessert was good, and each mochi piece was cut in half and drizzled with chocolate sauce. 

Service was superb. Our server was humorous, friendly, and attentive. Major props to him for giving us an entertaining and enjoyable service.

Overall, 3.5/5. Great service, but the sushi and sashimi is just OK."}
{"text":"Wow! I was so sketched out looking at the outside but as SOON as I sat down it was charming! The guys working knew what was good and how to do sushi! MAN! Loved every roll, and got the groupon for 20$ (pays for 40$ no happy hour though)- needless to say I've found my new sushi spot!"}
{"text":"Paul my server was very nice and attentive! Food was good and service was excellent! Would definitely recommend! All you can eat sushi too  and they gave me a \"treat\" when I left."}
{"text":"Seeing as how this was a newer sushi restaurant with decent reviews, my boyfriend and I thought we would give it a try one Friday evening. Our first impression of the establishment upon walking in: The building has definitely been redesigned and looks nice and clean. An employee was doing something behind the host stand as we entered but did not acknowledge us in any way. He was there fiddling with something for a few moments as we stood, looking at each other puzzled as to whether we should stay, and then he walked away without even glancing at us. Then a server walked out and greeted us and walked us to a table. He was very kind and ended up being our server for the night.

We ordered both garlic and regular edamame for appetizers. The garlic edamame was brought first and was not very flavorful; the garlic tasted minced and not fresh. When the regular edamame came out, it was very dry looking and tasting. We asked for some salt which helped a bit along with the soy sauce. The sushi was not very palatable at all. When eaten as a roll and dipped in sauces to mask tastes, it was okay, but when I ate a bite of the fish it was hard to stomach. We also ordered shrimp heads which did not taste right. I would have to agree with another reviewer who said that she had better tasting rolls for less.

The restrooms were very clean and so was the restaurant overall that I could see. We noticed that a food runner seemed to be having issues with bringing food to the wrong tables on several occasions."}
{"text":"Went there Friday with a friend to try their lunch all you can eat I purchased on Groupon.   Our server was a young Asian guy.  He was pretty attentive and made sure our drinks were filled :).   The appetizer was actually pretty good!  Tried Goyza, takoyaki, and tempura calamari all were really fresh and hot.   Nigiris were good fishes were fresh.  Not a big fan of their sushi rolls because of too much rice.  Overall we had a great lunch there!"}
{"text":"The food and service here is great. My friends and I met here for dinner tonight and we all loved our food. I am not a sushi person, so I stuck to the cooked selections. I had the fried lobster roll and my friend and I split a pound of crab legs with garlic butter. The lobster rolls were truly amazing and coming from the east coast, I can tell you the crab was steamed to perfection.
The staff is all so sweet and attentive and the manager came to our table to see how everything was. We even got a free dessert which was amazing. 
The place is clean and well kept and the restrooms are very clean as well. This local business is great and is in an area that needs more businesses. This business deserves the community's support and seems to want to support this community."}
{"text":"It would've been nice if we had known ahead of time that the all you can eat special is only on Thursday now. I drove 20 miles for this at only to find out that they canceled the all you can eat during the week."}
{"text":"Service was friendly and the prices were reasonable. We tried the okie dokie roll, the philly roll and the dragon roll. We also had an appetizer and mochi ice cream for dessert. All in all it was a nice date night out and I think we will definitely come back. They seem to have good lunch specials or happy hours deals too so worth coming back just for those."}
{"text":"This place is actually surprisingly good. As you walk in here you might expect a shabby remodel, but it looks pretty classy. They did a great job making it look like their own instead of a cheap take over building. And the sushi is pretty good. Especially in comparison to other sushi places close by. Among their creative menu they carry Uni which is my favorite type of sushi. And most other places don't usually have it. 
I've been here a couple of times and have not been disappointed."}
{"text":"The food is alright. Not so good rating because I've been here 3 times. The first was open menu, the second was all you can eat, the third went in for all you can eat and that's only on Thursday now. I don't like going to a restaurant and every time the whole menu concept is different. I'll just stick to my go to sushi joint where I know exactly what they have and how I'll be able to order."}
{"text":"Sunday can be a capricious day to eat sushi.  Lots of places don't necessary have the freshest sushi and that happened to me with the yellowtail.  Everything else was good (salmon had terrific marbling, red tuna) but the sushi chef's lack of attention to detail will prevent me from returning (hamachi carving appeared lazy, rice wasn't formed very well for the nigiri, requested jalapeno in a roll and got none). I'm a bit of a sushi snob, having lived in Vancouver, so I have very high expectations when eating sushi.  If i'm looking for good valued sushi I would return to this place on a Sunday since they have a great happy hour."}
{"text":"This is my favourite korean-chineses restarant in Arizona. their food is amazing and service is prompt. I do love Jjampong( spicy seafood noddle) and palbochae and kanpoongki. best dishes ever.!"}
{"text":"Extremely large portions, and not in a good way. Jjajangmyun noodles were not fresh and looked and tasted old, it was nearly impossible to mix the sauce in because the noodles were cooked ahead of time so all the strands were sticking to each other. While we were eating, the owner came by to ask if we needed to-go boxes. We were nowhere near done eating. Then she brought us the check (still eating, by the way).  There were multiple empty tables and it was nowhere near closing time (we were there around 8, they close at 9:30). Overall a very offputting experience."}
{"text":"Come here ALL THE TIME. The staff is awesome. The Owner always comes around and interacts with the customers. We've tried a million different things, and everything is delicious!! Definitely my favorite sushi place. Good food, excellent service."}
{"text":"Went last night and got the 30% off deal which was great as it allowed us to try several dishes on the menu. The fish in the sushi was very fresh. Prices were very comparable to other sushi restaurants; not cheap, but certainly not high end. I am definitely planning to return and hope they have a lunch menu too."}
{"text":"I have been three or four times in the past couple months.   Friendly staff.  Biker gang patrons - sweetly parked motorcycles in an orderly fashion.  Well-made Maki rolls, even if you request a deviation from the menu.  I like mine with a bit of heat & add some jalepenos = no problem!  Spicy is better!   Nigiri was shaped well and the Sashimi slices were nice & even.  Bonus: on Sundays they have a really well priced HH menu.   

So yeah, I am pretty excited about this place.  Check it out!  I hope that Crazy Sushi & Crab is here to stay!  (which speaks volumes considering the whole mall situation).  We haven't had a really decent & well priced sushi spot in the Fiesta/Mesa area for a while.  WELCOME CRAZY!!!   The \"other\"tini location up the street has sloppy rolls and is way over priced.    I am super delighted that Crazy is on-point so far.  

This is an old T.G.I.Friday's bldg in a low traffic location, so the floor plan/layout is a bit obvious but they have done a great job at cleaning it up and adding a touch of Japanese decor.  My only small tiny complaint, is that there are no baby diaper changing stations in the restrooms (mens or womens).  Sorry peeps, this is my new thing.  I have a 5mo old.  He's not eating sushi just yet, but his mom & dad do."}
{"text":"Love love love the Chinese korean food here. Ordered hot braised chicken and jajang mien.  Chicken dish is very flavorful with lots of onion and bell peppers. So is the noddle. Lots of leftover to take home too."}
{"text":"Who doesn't love sushi! I go crazy at this place on Thursday's the all you can eat special they have makes my mouth water! The chef Luis is amazing and takes good care of me every time I come in! The sushi selection is insane and at the price I'm getting it for I feel like it's a steal. The place has a a Japanese pub vibe and hopefully people enjoy it as much as I do"}
{"text":"Enjoyed the sushi, the service and the prices We will be back!  They prove that even when you are busy, and a little overwhelmed, you can still give good service, Isn't that what it is all about?

Thanks to everyone at \"CRAZY\" sushi."}
{"text":"I don't think I've ever left a negative review but this place can be described by three words. Terrible. Service was awful, offered happy hour prices to then find out we would t get them and the happy hour items we were given as recommendations were not on happy hour regardless. In addition to this the sushi was not good. This place makes fry's sushi sound amazing. They did have some bomb ice-cream for my birthday so u would advise to stick with with the free ice-cream and water unless something changes."}
{"text":"Food tasted fine, but service was SO SLOW. Especially for lunch. The meals weren't brought out together (which was awkward) and took awhile to make. We sat for about 15 minutes after they knew we were done with or food for our checks, which we had to ask for. I had the California rolls and the chicken cup bop. 

UPDATE: After leaving this restaurant, I started to feel uneasy. I was sick the rest of the evening until it got out of my system. I found out my coworkers who also had the cup bop also got sick. We will definitely not be returning."}
{"text":"This place Stole my sushi heart. Everybody is super helpful and friendly. The server, bartender and owner all checked with us to make sure we were happy and satisfied with our service. The sake selections were amazing! I highly recommend the peach or pomegranate !"}
{"text":"I love this place. A nice, classy atmosphere with Sapporo on tap and the best sushi in town. We keep going back because everything is delicious, make sure you get a salad with that fantastic house dressing!  Yum!"}
{"text":"Delicious! Friendly service. My husband loved the soup and I loved the sashimi. The price was good too. My husband and I also liked the atmosphere of the place."}
{"text":"I really really likes this place !! We went there for the happy hour and I was shocked at how good the sushi was! I'm a super picky sushi eater and my friends made me step out of my Comfort zone and try this and I was impressed . I had a spicy tuna roll , salad , and garlic edamame . The salad had this amazing dressing and it was also sprinkled with crap. The owner of the restaurant made sure to come up and ask how we were doing . There menu is huge and lots of selection. I felt bad there wasn't more people in there but it's because there a new business. I recommend it ! Support your small owned local businesses !!"}
{"text":"My favorite place for some Korean Chinese food!! Luv their jjajangmyun and jjampong!! Highly recommend this place!! All the dishes are amazing and moderately priced!!"}
{"text":"My mom and I decided to try this place out as it is one of the few places in the valley to offer fusion Korean-Chinese food. We went during the day, and sushi diners are placed on the \"upper level\" (the restaurant is divided into a higher and lower ledge) and those there for the Korean food are on the ground floor. While the food is okay, we will not be back due to the horrible service and treatment of the servers.

We went in on a Sunday afternoon.To preface, both ourselves, the menu, and our waitress were Korean. We got served with a dirty plate, and it was obvious that our waitress did not want to be there. We ordered a spicy shrimp dish, black bean noodles, and a spicy noodle dish. Now, she did not write our order down and we were promptly served with a sesame chicken dish instead. When we lamented that this was definitely not what we ordered (as we dislike sesame oil), she literally stood there silently and we chalked it up the fact that the dish differed in name only by one word and there must have been miscommunication (due to the fact that she was just standing there looking down at the floor; it was just awkward and I assumed maybe it was a company policy that they wouldn't take back the food). We did not touch the dish.

Now, it could have been fine after this. However, she delivered the black bean noodles and she was not seen again. Almost 15 minutes passed and I was basically done with my food. My mother and I assumed that she forgot to order her food, and looked for her to tell her it was fine and that we just wanted the check so we could leave. However, she stops by then to drop off her food and leaves immediately without checking in on us. By this time, both of our waters are empty. 

My mom picks at her food for a bit when the waiter from our sushi section asks if everything is okay. Now, by this time, there is a full untouched plate of chicken, an empty noodle bowl, a half touched spicy noodle dish, and empty waters. He acknowledged and apologized for the service we received (although we were not his table) and we just asked for our check from him, as our server was still nowhere to be found. Although he managed to give us a 10% discount, we did not see our server or the manager stop by our table. We left, hungry and thirsty.

Do not come here. The service was horrible and although the food is good, it is not worth it. Having worked in the industry myself, I understand when things are busy or when things are just overseen. However, my experience here was unacceptable and I am appalled that the manager did not even stop by our table. I would give it zero stars if I could."}
{"text":"We came here because of how much we missed Sun Chinese. However, when we came they were not adequately staffed to assist 25+ people. 

Other than the party of 25, the place was nearly empty. We waited 1.5 hours until our food arrived. Not to mention that people that came in after us, received their food first. 

Hopefully it was just that day and not how it will always be.

I'll give them one more chance and if they do better, I will change this review bc that kind of service really would lose customers."}
{"text":"Seriously the best sushi i town! I love this place. Im literally there 5 days a week because the food, service, and ambiance are top notch! Not to mention amazing prices.  I highly recomend this restraunt to any who appreciate fine japanese cuisine:)"}
{"text":"Luis the sushi chef is the best, no shit!!!! Thursday's all you can eat the best in mesa . The servers are learning so be nice. The fish is the freshest, you can get in az in my opinion salmon eel  tuna everything is so good"}
{"text":"Food here is inconsistant.
Jampong was good today but Jajang & Japchaebop was very disappointing.
One server & she looks so exhausted, was afraid to ask for anything. She looks like she is ready to faint!
Very soft spoken voice & no energy...over worked, maybe. But the food, the portion of food, price is definitely much much better than new Asiana Market food court.
At least it's not instant package noodle from the market."}
{"text":"I could eat my body weight in sushi.

There's never a time when I don't want sushi.  When the chance came up to try a new place I haven't been to before, I was hesitant but I figured it couldn't hurt.  Upon walking into the place, I was both impressed and scared --- impressed because this place was huge and swanky-looking and scared because there was only three other tables being occupied inside this mammoth restaurant.  Shortly after being seated, two of the tables cleared out and the restaurant was awkwardly quiet with the exception of the soft jazz they were playing.  Still though, we stayed seated in the room with the grand looking bar and ordered our food.

So what can be said about the food?  Well, it really wasn't that bad.  It was decent actually.  It was standard basic sushi and at a lunch menu price, I was okay with my meal.  The Crazy Fire Roll had zero spice which was a surprise.  They're huge rolls and tasted fine but didn't quite deliver what was advertise --- make me hurt, babie! 

Anyways, Crazy Sushi & Crab is a clean modern place that delivers good food.  Is it anything crazy special?  I gotta be honest and say no.  But maybe you'll like it!"}
{"text":"Went early on a Friday evening, greeted by the owner who introduced us to our waitress. Pleased with the atmosphere and cleanliness. We are sushi lovers and seek quality. The poke tuna was spot on. That alone will have us returning for more. We also ordered tempura shrimp, they came out piping hot and crunchy. But not stopping there we enjoyed the lobster and dynamite rolls. Both baked and very generously sized. Our only complaint was that everything was so good we kept eating. I don't write reviews often but know a good place when I taste it. Glad it's in my neighborhood. I enjoy supporting our great local businesses. But this one even warrants a trip if you seek quality."}
{"text":"I brought a group of about 8 friends here on a Thursday night.  It wasn't very busy when we got there, and the staff was quick to set up a table to accommodate our size.  The service was excellent, and we had two to three people checking on us regularly.  The servers were very knowledgeable about the menu, as well as specials and upcoming specials.  

The food--- DELICIOUS.  Every single one of us - all very picky eaters - LOVED everything we were served.  

The icing on the cake was when the manager came out, personally thanked us for coming, made sure we were happy with everything, and brought us some mochi ice cream.  

I honestly was a little wary at first (sushi places in town can be very good or very bad), but they well exceeded my expectations.  I highly recommend this place, it's fantastic!"}
{"text":"My friends and I came here for sushi on a Sunday morning. As soon as the door was opened, a friendly waiter went out of his way to open up the door and welcome us. This restaurant is definitely spacious and well decorated. If you have a huge party to dine in, this is definitely the right place for you to go. 

As a group, we ordered edamame for an appetizer, 14 pieces of sashimi, caterpillar roll, Alaska and Jalapeno crunch roll. The edamame was soaked in spicy oil and garlic sauce. It was so delicious that I could not stop eating it. The sashimi plates have 4 pieces of different types of fish. I wouldn't say it was terrible, but it was just average. I think what really ruins it for me is their wasabi. The coloration looks a bit odd and it doesn't have much kick to it. My friends and I smear a huge portion of it all over the sushi and fish.....and still....nothing. 

Overall, I think the food here is average, service is outstanding, and the atmosphere is great. If I am in the area, I will give it another try again (but I might bring my own wasabi to come here)."}
{"text":"I had heard great things about this place, and we live around the corner so we thought we would check it out for Valentine's Day. We got there and nobody greeted us for quite sometime. We were just about to leave when they seated us. It was another 20 minutes until we ordered, and a half hour after that for food to arrive. 

When it did arrive, it was just ok. The tea and miso soup were less than ok. 

The servers didn't care about customer service, except for one guy who said, \"I don't work here, I'm just helping out tonight.\" The place was practically empty and we saw other people leave. We never even got refills on our water. I had to get up and ask the server to put in another order (we'd been waiting for 30 minutes for anyone to come by), and he said, \"you know we close at 9:30 right?\" 

We'd been sitting there since 8:30... it was 9...

He took my order after huffing and puffing, and we waited another half hour for him to go, \"well the sushi chef is really busy and he hasn't made them yet...\" 

Again, the place was practically empty and the rolls were coming out fast, the servers were slow and rude, and I think they just didn't want to honor the all you can eat sushi Groupon they were running. We even saw one couple get up to the check, and it still took 30 minutes after that.

Needless to say, we took the check and left.
That was surprisingly terrible. There are many other local sushi places we will continue to support that have quality food and quality service."}
