{"text":"Went for Hubby's birthday and had a wonderful experience.    We had the Cold Smoked Elk Carpaccio, Pickled Blueberries, First Pressed Canola & Foie Gras Parfait, Apple Bourbon Gelée, Compressed Apple to start.  Excellent choices!  I'm not a pate fan but the Foie Gras was fabulous.    For dinner, Hubby had the Seared Halibut, White Bean and Chorizo Ragout, Clams, Blistered Cherry Tomato Sauce Vierge and I had the Birch Smoked Duck Breast, Steel Cut Oat and Mushroom Risotto, Braised Red Cabbage, Natural Duck Jus.  Absolutely delicious!    And we ended with Brie Cheesecake, Poppy Seed Honey, Raspberry Fluid Gel - yeah, not so much. I love Brie and I love cheesecake but together, not so fabulous.  Just not my taste I guess.  All in all, a great experience I would definitely repeat."}
{"text":"I went to Rouge for a private function.  The restaurant is an old Victorian house, they have a garden outback which I would like to check out sometime in the summer.  I thought this place was really cool, kind of a different feel, great atmosphere.  The staff were great, and very professional.  The food, for the most part, was amazing.  They served a beet salad, and I hate beets but everyone else seemed to enjoy it.  Because it was a private function, most of the menu was set.  We did however have a choice for the main course.   I had the catfish.  So good! And of course beautifully presented.  The creme brulee I had for desert was also delicious! I would definitely recommend this place to anyone who likes high quality food and dining experience.  It is pricey however, but that is to be expected.  Worth it for a special occasion for sure."}
{"text":"I was here in April to celebrate a new job with my boyfriend. We did the chefs special with the premium wine pairings and it was seriously amazing. Expensive for sure but well, well worth it. Five stars. The service was great as well which makes it all the better. It's always nice when you have the service and quality matching the price."}
{"text":"We had the chef's tasting menu and I have to say it was one of the best dining experiences I have had. The flavours, texture... it was just perfect. They include a lot of organic, locally grown items in the menu and even grow some of them in their beautiful garden, which you can tour as you enjoy of a glass of wine.   The only reason I don't give 5 stars in my review was the service. Although our waitress was very nice, she had no idea what kind of wines she was serving and even had trouble explaining the dishes. In any regular restaurant this would not had been an issue but with such beautiful food, it was a shame we didn't get to learn more about the pairings and what they were going for with each choice."}
{"text":"This restaurant is tasty and decadent! We ate dinner there and everything from the bread to the flourless brownie bite that came with our bill was divine! I really enjoyed the amuse bouche courses that they added for free to cleanse our palate. We arrived and were about to be seated, when I saw a table in the window that I liked more than the one we were first shown. So they made up the table in the window for us, no worries and while we waited a few minutes, they gave us some champagne to start off our food experience. It truly is an experience for your taste buds! I had the salted root vegetable salad and loved it! I would have added a bit of goat cheese crumbles to it, but it was fresh, tasty and well plated.  Then I had the pork loin with smoked pork shoulder. The pork shoulder was nicely smoked and unbelievable in flavour. It came on a sweet potato puree, which was too much for me. A smaller portion of the sweet potato would've sufficed as the meal ended up sinking into it and each item was covered. The pork loin was under cooked for my liking, it was rare and I've never had rare pork before and wasn't a fan of the taste. Because the portion of shoulder was enough, I didn't feel the need to complain. My fiancee had the duck terrine, which was also delicious and the duck breast main. Duck breast was cooked to perfection and came with some perogies that I could have easily eaten many more! Our hosts and waiters were fantastic and made the evening very enjoyable. Thanks Rouge!"}
{"text":"We went to Rouge for my husband's birthday and it was a good experience. The restaurant is located at Inglewood in an old house, divided into a few rooms, which gives a warm and cozy feeling. The service was perfect, our waiter was professional and attentive. We had foie gras, which was good. The entrees (duck and cod) were amazing. For dessert, we had the pana cota, very tasteful, and the flourless chocolate torte which was just all right (this is my only disappointment). We have been offered a beef tartar for an amuse bouche which was excellent, as well as and macaroons (beets & hazelnut) with a surprising taste and delicious taste. The bread is excellent too... I would go back for special occasion."}
{"text":"Due to the nature of my job, I eat out several times a week and have to say this is one of the best experiences I have had.  The food was amazing, great location and the service was exceptional.  I will definitely be going back to this top notch establishment."}
{"text":"I don't get all the good reviews about this place. I came to this place too many times because all my colleagues come here because they don't want to walk outside of the building to have lunch. But if i had the choice, I'd go anywhere but here! They have a lunch menu and i tried all the plates on it in order to find something decent to eat but everything is disgusting. If you want asian food, this is NOT asian! The pad thai taste like spaghetti. Service is ok. Prices are high for the poor quality food. I don't recommend this place."}
{"text":"Rouge is a great place to go for a special occasion such as an anniversary or a birthday. The service befits a fine dining experience with a two minute introduction to the home and its history. The flat iron steak and roasted duck looked, smelled and tasted wonderful. The dessert of lemon cake was somewhat disappointing. Over and done with in three small bites."}
{"text":"Absolutely perfect. Impeccable service, amazing food, and knowledgeable staff. The best restaurant in Calgary hands down."}
{"text":"The food here is excellent.  They are allergy friendly so don't be shy to tell them what you are allergic too, they are really careful.  Love the general tao!  It is important to mention that the service is very long between each course."}
{"text":"My favorite restaurant in Calgary, and maybe in the world.  The service is always excellent. Menu adventurous. I fell in love with this restaurant when I tried their lobster cappuccino at a wine and food tasting years ago. I have been back for many different occasions.  You can taste the fresh ingredients and the sophistication of this world ranked restaurant.  Only if I could afford to go there all the time ... :)"}
{"text":"It's a great restaurant and the food is good. It's our anniversary but we are so disappointed that it's not a place for romance and quiet enjoyment. It's so noisy and the customer are not respecting each other'. I have been here a few times but if Ione is looking for a special night, it's not a place for you. It's like a bar or lounge, definitely not a fine dining one. However the servers are very understanding and thoughtful, they move us up to the second floor to save my night."}
{"text":"I was very disappointed with the rouge the food was mediocre way over priced an our waiter Thomas did not provide  good service at all we had to ask him to come to our table for everything we wanted an then he had attitude when we dint tip him will never go back worse 300$ I have ever spent for supper"}
{"text":"Rouge is fine dining at its finest! The food was absolutely delicious. We got the Chef's Tasting Menu which I highly recommend if you can spend a little extra for a special occasion. They were extremely accommodating and gave us extra treats and signed cards because it was our Anniversary. Amazing customer service and amazing food! Your money is well spent here! I highly recommend to anyone going out for a very special occasion!"}
{"text":"Great service, great wine, good food.  We went for my bday which was maybe why the bill was over $500 for two people.  We just did the chefs pairing which was just good, the beef tartar was the highlight without question.  A couple of the wines were terrible but we ordered a bottle to have at the table just in case the wine they paired was brutal.   The food was good, not great as I mentioned.  Will we be back...yes, but,  I will order off the menu."}
{"text":"Le Restaurant Rouge au Dix 30 est un très beau restaurant le décor est très chaleureux. Pour se qui est de la bouffe le menu offre beaucoup de choix, beaucoup trop a mon gout. Il est difficile de faire un choix. J'ai finalement choisi le riz frit Rouge et mon copain le General Tao. Les portions sont très généreuse de toutes les fois que je suis allée je n'ai jamais fini un plat. Le général tao était délicieux! Pour se qui est du riz frit bon sans plus."}
{"text":"Poulet général tao, excellent! Le nouveau rouleau aux crevettes géantes servie avec sauce aux arachides est vraiment bon! Pour le service, demandez Lyne, vous ne serez pas déçu :)!"}
{"text":"Honestly, even though I've eaten at Rouge before and enjoyed it, I was more than a little disappointed with my experience on Mother's Day. While I understand that a 2:00 pm seating is late for a Brunch, we had morning engagements and needed to book a later time. It's a set menu, and if seating someone at 2:00 pm is too late for a three-course meal, then don't seat people so late. We did not dally with making our choices, it was just how long the meal took.   Everything started off alright, but soon after we were seated I noticed that the staff seemed to be getting restless. We were seated right by the bar area, and the staff kept coming over to check in with whoever was tending the bar to ask who was being cut next, when it was their turn, what table they were waiting for so that they could cash out and go home. Numerous times there was a gathering of several employees chatting loudly right behind our table. There were also several occasions where they complained loudly about the manager on duty for seating people in places that didn't make sense to the staff. Then they began to tidy around us, moving the tables and chairs around us. I've been in the private room at Rouge before, which is where they were tidying, so I know that there are doors that close. It would have been nice if they had closed it so we didn't have to watch the staff sweeping and moving all the tables to go home.  Throughout the meal, the frequency with which our waiter came to the table decreased. He seemed really impatient with us every single time he came back to the table. I understand that it was a special occasion and that the staff just wanted to go home, but we chose to celebrate Mother's Day at Rouge, ended up with a large bill - which I knew we would because it's a set menu, but when you plan to spend $50 a person plus drinks plus gratuity, you expect a certain type of dining experience. I do not feel that we received that experience at Rouge on Mother's Day."}
{"text":"We had a great day in Calgary and looked for a restaurant with good reviews. Found this place in an odd part of town. Parked in their lot down the street. Walked up to a dead atmosphere on a Tuesday at lunch and we were turned down because our two kids were less than 10 years old."}
{"text":"I haven't had the full dinner experience, nor tried the Chef's complete tasting menu, but it sounds like others have had great experiences.  It certainly isn't cheap, but Rouge has won many accolades from food critics - including landing a spot on San Pellegrino World's Best Restaurants list (2010).    I have been for lunch and dessert - both of which were delicious and accompanied by stellar service.  One of the things that I enjoy the most about Rouge is their garden.  Despite the location in a relatively densely popluated area of Inglewood, the A.E. Cross House is on a pretty large plot of land.  The Rouge team uses the area to grow fresh vegetables and herbs as well as house their small greenhouse for tomatoes.  We had the pleasure of meeting the Chef de Cuisine, JP Pedhirney, who explained their food philosophy.  They take the \"local\" food movement to heart, and get inspiration for their food from their garden.  They then source additional food from local farmers and try to keep it as close to home as possible.  He was friendly, knowledgeable and passionate about food.  For lunch, I enjoyed the Braised Short Rib which was incredibly tender with a well balanced, flavorful sauce.  My side salad was fairly average, although it was accompanied by deep fried chick peas which I didn't really care for.  I have also tried 2 different desserts here.  I may be a bit biased because I'm not a big dessert fan.  The panacotta with oatmeal crisp topping was delicious and not overly sweet.  We also had the chocolate chip cake with bacon.  I know that deserts with bacon are all the rage right now, but I personally prefer my bacon without sugar - and this particular desert didn't convert me.  Overall, I've quite enjoyed my two experiences at Rouge.  I guess I will have to come for dinner one of these days for the full experience."}
{"text":"Best dinner I've had in Calgary. The house is apparently haunted and has been around some time as a restaurant.  Food was amazing, fresh, full of local ingredients and well presented. Friends even had a vegetarian meal prepared on-the-fly, off menu that was to die for.   Service is great too!"}
{"text":"Excellent service, food and atmosphere. Will be back again and again!"}
{"text":"World class in Calgary! Enjoyed three wonderful hours experiencing the tasting menu and wine pairings last night. Excellent service, seven courses of delightful delicious creative 'fun'.  Perfect for those of you that want the best of European food here at home.  Thanks Rouge!"}
{"text":"Our group came here for Christmas party a week. Service was great but food was rather disappointing especially with prices like that. Salad has little to no dressing. My char was \"meh\" but it needed some sort of sauce. My colleague's duck was tough and needed sauce as well. Both were served with two potato croquets and two root vegetables. The brownie dessert was dry and nothing special. At the end, I ate a hamburger from a fast food chain."}
{"text":"What a great dining experience.  Enjoyed it from the moment I walked in though the tour afterwards.  Appetizers, tartare with mushrooms and eggs yolk, elk with chimichira sauce and pork loin with raspberry polenta,    Dang.  The bread was hot and had oil and raspberry vinagarette. Afterwards, a tour of the home."}
{"text":"I got the Dragon and Phoenix meal but when I was a kid I had it with general tso sauce and I asked if that was possible and they said any sauce you like we can do. I also got the dumplings with peanut sauce.  First tried some of the dumplings and it was the beast peanut sauce I have ever had. It was very peanut buttery with I think a little bit of brown sauce that is usually with dumplings but it was amazing. I then had the dragon and Phoenix which was a pretty thick sauce but so good. The shrimp was very large and the chicken was longer strips so it wasn't little fried balls of chicken."}
{"text":"I honestly believe that my experience at Rouge was not worth the money. $215 per person and  3 out of 5 courses were nothing but disappointment. The combination of ingredients didn't work and food was rather bland. I was given Canadian wine on two occasions and a glass of cider! Only two wines were French and not that impressive either. I had this impression that they tried to get rid off some food and that's why it was put on chef's menu.  Will I ever be back? doubt it. There are better restaurants in Calgary"}
{"text":"Very nice asian place. Large menu. We had a large table, the service was top notch. I had Shanghai noodles, it came with chicken, very good.  The portions are too big, but if you can take half home why not. Hot and sour soup was a little bland."}
{"text":"Great service and ambiance.  Came here for a Saturday night supper and enjoyed it extremely well even though we had lowered our expectations.  It took a while to get us seated but once we were ensconced in our seats, which was in a very comfortable banquette, we had exemplary dining experience.  The server was friendly and very helpful with suggestions for entree, the salt and pepper calamari, which was cooked to perfection, briny, salty, fresh and crisp.  Big portions that were not over-cooked.  For dinner, we had the Seafood Nest and the Peking duck wrap.  Well done with the presentation, flavour and portion.  It was authentic and tasty.  I was very pleased with the portions considering that this was more expensive than what I was used to going to a proper Chinese restaurant.  But kudos to our server who checked on us but in an unobtrusive manner.  She made the evening so lovely and pleasant.  If I am ever in the area again I will definitely try this place:)"}
{"text":"Two stars for service, three stars for food. Had the chef tasting menu. Food was good but a little too salty on most dishes (eg carrot soup, tuna tartare). Foie gras was very good. Main entree was BBQ'd quail with broccoli - would've expected something more elaborate and expensive for a $115/pp tasting menu. Disappointed with the cheese and dessert (last two courses). Overall, not a lot of unique flavour pairings, uniqueness and elaboration in the dishes to justify such an expensive price tag and a spot in Canada's top 100 restaurants. Ambiance was nice - nice backyard patio. You can walk around their large backyard and look at their vegetable garden (don't set expectations high...just a regular backyard garden). Here's my biggest complaint: There was a wedding happening at the same time on the second floor of the restaurant and it felt like service to regular customers was sacrificed. Given the restaurant was aware that a wedding was taking place, adequate staff and resources should have been prepared. We were there for two hours and only got to the main entree by the two hour mark. 1.5 hours into the dinner we asked our server Ryan to speed up the courses. We were waiting a very long time (20-25 mins) between courses. He apologized and explained that the wedding was affecting their service speed. We said we had a hard cut off at 8pm as we had a show to catch. We expected they would do everything to meet the request. We asked to have the rest of the courses packed to go. Even with this request we were kept there until 8:20pm. The restaurant didnt do us any favours on the bill.  I am disappointed with the service level and quality of food. Not worth a $300 bill for two. Not worth being on Canada's top 100 restaurants. Wouldnt recommend doing the tasting menu."}
{"text":"4.5 Rouge, Rouge, Rouge. A gem of an establishment in a quaint, hipster part of Calgary.   Rouge is the place I take important clients, special dates, and close friends. I find that the dinners are better than the lunches and that the chef's tasting is the best way to receive the full Rouge experience.  The physical structure of Rouge is quite unique to Calgary. A heritage home in Inglewood has been converted in to a restaurant, much like L'Hermitage in Vancouver. Thus, the restaurant is segregated in to rooms, accompanying no more than a handful of tables in each room.   What's also neat about Rouge is that they've got their own garden from which they harvest a variety of organic food. It'll appear in the oil to dip your bread in, as a side accompanying beautiful local meats, etc.   The service has ranged from superb to average. But I do not fault Rouge for \"average\" service as I know the establishment gives opportunities to bushy-tailed, bright-eyed younger folk who are still new to the industry.  I'm looking forward to my next dinner here!"}
{"text":"I wish I could give this restaurant more than 2 stars.  I was there on the weekend for my hubbys birthday dinner  ( One of 2 actually - Anju was the clear favourite!) and we both left disappointed.  Walking up to the ol house its impressive - from the foilage to the signpost, to the gate to the house itself, its beautiful. Once inside, it feels like you are in a heritage bldg. We were told we were going to be seated outside but were asked if we preferred inside - We did, so we were given a table inside...we were glad of it. The outside tables were in a marquis tent with clear plastic sides ( opaque aka blurry),and although the tables were dressed the same as inside, the chairs were essentially plastic garden furniture.  The patrons all faced into the backyard - and the mood in there was deadly - like they were attending a post funeral brunch.  We were so glad we weren't in there.  We started our meal with a cocktail - the Rouge - and after waiting quite a while for it - the server brought us over 2 glasses of bubbly while we were waiting for our cocktails and apologized. When the drinks did come we sipped them and said nothing.. it was only about 10 minutes later that we both told each other how much we hated them. They tasted medicinal. Like a ricola candy liquefied into a drink and blended with  god only knows what else - definitely not enjoyable.  For our starters, I had the butter leaf salad - my hubby had the shrimp salad.  My salad, while beautiful was so bland. SO bland. The only thing on the plate that was a stand out were the poached tomatoes and they were good - bless em.  The shrimp salad was apparently the same, not bland as in subtle and refined, but bland as in lacking flavour and seasoning.  For the mains - I had asked for an assortment of veggies- ( I am a vegetarian) and when it arrived, although visually appealing - was once again lacking in flavour - where was the seasoning?  The birthday boy had the duck breast and loved it - apparently it was delicious- so that is a good thing.  For dessert we ordered the buttermilk cake and I will say it was the best thing of the night and I am not a dessert fan - it was moist and decadent - however it didnt make up for me - for the  rest of an underseasoned meal.  The service was efficient and pleasant - its just a shame that the food didnt match the reputation or price that went along with the service standard.  A highlight of the night was walking through the garden out back where they grow alot of the ingredients that you eat while dining. The vibe in the garden in quite amazing - serene and beautiful. All in all though, the food should be the star here - and the night we went it definitely wasnt shining very brightly."}
{"text":"Have been to this place a few times over the years, calling it Asisn Fusion is a pretty generous term. It is your typical fully Americanized Chinese restaurant. Basically general Tao chicken and spring rolls, very comparable to PF changs which fits well with the 1030 location"}
{"text":"A bit over rated.  Food was good but small portions as expected, but pricey.  Excellent service."}
{"text":"What an amazing dinner experience. Our waiter was very accommodating and very professional. It takes skill in being able to describe every ingredient in a dish and every method of cooking preparation as if the customers were being served ambrosia from the gods of Olympus. But this is by no means cheap sell, the dishes served at Rouge were amazing. My favorites were:  -Pear and Foie gras mouse -Bison Carpaccio -Elk medallions  The dishes were delicious and you really got a sense that each ingredient was fresh and organic in the way it was all prepared and presented. They also made great wine suggestions.  I was a bit disappointed that other people in my table didn't want to try the tasting menu, but I will certainly be back for that."}
{"text":"Rouge, heard it is rated #1 in Calgary? Its situated in the most Haunted House \"Dean House\" in Calgary, Wow!  http://www.avenuecalgary.com/City-Life/Calgarys-Most-Haunted-Buildings/. I would rated the foods 3.5 to 4 at the most. Its great foods but not the Wow feeling! The best for the night would goes to the Lamb dish with local sustainable farm. The lamb meat was really tender, juicy & has a bit of east indian spice kick to it when chewing in the mouth. Ambient was good but not really romantic setting, service was great! Recommend to try if you are curious. The bill was $252/person CAD with Chef's choice selections $100/person and alcohol of course. It was a great night out!"}
{"text":"Good food. Good service. Good atmosphere. Good selection. Reasonable prices. I recommend it if you're in the area for a heavy lunch or a dinner."}
{"text":"The rouge experience was OUT OF THIS WORLD. Our server was everything. He first gave us an exciting 2 minute introduction of the restaurant, and his enthusiasm the whole time he did that was amazing. He made us feel very welcome without being annoying, you can tell he loves his job dearly. His knowledge about the food and wine menu is exceptional. Don't know what wine to order for your main course? Ask him. Want to know more about the rumored 'ghost'? He'll gladly tell you without making you feel stupid for asking. With this exceptional service and delicious food, it was one dining experience I will not forget."}
{"text":"A very delicious meal for sure - I had the pheasant and really enjoyed it.  The Nanaimo bar was also very good.  I've always wanted to try foie gras so decided to give it a go - too rich for me, but I did like the chicken liver pate.  The service was excellent - attentive, very polished, everything is presented with an explanation.  The only thing I wish is that the atmosphere was slightly more intimate - I felt very much out in the open with how the tables were arranged (we were seated in a room upstairs), and that we did not have much privacy with our conversation.  I would come back for a special occassion, but may be a little bit too spendy for frequent visits!  It is definitely a place where you would want to dress up a bit more - the \"older\" crowd was generally dressed appropriately (ie. no jeans).  The younger generation, myself included, were in jeans - and I personally felt underdressed and a bit out of place."}
{"text":"Great place,  food,  plates and all but we had to wait for about 15-20 minutes before we could sit even if we had reservations...  So I guess they could work on that. Service was good,  size of the plates is above average. Prices are a bit high so without the wine bottle expect a 25-30 dollar per person."}
{"text":"Un endroit génial pour prendre un bon repas entre amis avant de sortir au théâtre."}
{"text":"My husband brought me here for my birthday. What a wonderful surprise! From the beautiful restored house that is Rouge to the impeccable service it was definitely a night to remember. We had the Chef's complete tasting menu, an absolute \"must try\". My husband is a real regular meat and potatoes guy, and not usually the type to try new and interesting sounding meals. Rouge totally surprised us both; pairings that we never would have thought of tasted like pure heaven. We left absolutely stuffed (don't let the portion sizes fool you, you will not leave hungry), but very impressed. My only regret is that we can't afford to go weekly."}
{"text":"Amazing experience!  French styled cuisine that is prepared with all the details in mind. Good quality and flavours are perfection!  The restaurant is situated in Inglewood in an older house. The charm and ambiance are nice.   Service was great as was the recommendation for wine with our meal.   Great experience overall."}
{"text":"Great service! The spring rolls are nice, hot, and crispy! Great fried banana for desert too. Nice terrace with an e"}
{"text":"I was very much looking forward to enjoying a meal here after reading great things about this restaurant on various websites. Unfortunately I was left very disappointed. It was not authentic french cuisine by any means. Only a few dishes on the menu resembled french dining and even they were tampered with to the extent they were almost unrecognisable as a french dish. The flavours of the food as a whole was good but I was extremely disappointed with a few things. Firstly and perhaps most importantly the facade of being a french dining experience. It is not anything like my dining experiences anywhere in France. My food was warm at best and not cooked to order. I had ordered the Bison, a tasty but very small piece of meat, I asked for it to be cooked medium. It was medium rare at best, borderline rare and lacked warmth. After already being disappointed with the Foie Gras appetiser that was no larger that a two dollar coin and a \"glass\" of wine that couldn't have exceeded more than 5 ounces we were ready to leave. For 4 people only having a starter main and 2 drinks our bill came to $300. We were all still hungry and left feeling robbed. So we went to an alternative restaurant and had a proper meal. All of this not mentioning the whole time feeling like you are in a concentration camp, god forbid if you are to laugh, I think the 'guards' would collapse!"}
{"text":"Flew in from San Francisco to attend my cousin's outdoor garden wedding here. Such a charming place and the food was delicious. Lots of wine and bubbly. :-) Had a wonderful, memorable time with family. The garden area made for some great wedding pictures, too. Quite an amazing experience."}
{"text":"Bel endroit, belle ambiance. Par contre le prix par rapport au type de nourriture servie, est un peu élevé. Je peux retrouver la même chose, meilleur et moins chère. Service courtois et rapide. Super endroit pour les repas en groupe. Pour les magasineux, le restaurant est en plein quartier 10-30 à Brossard."}
{"text":"4.5 stars  Went for a date night Sat July 16th during stampede.  Everyone was seated on the patio, since it was nice outside.  Wow, amazing service and FOOD!  The main courses were perfect...  We had tuna, and the peking duck.  From start to finish, had a great meal.  Highly recomended.  In the same class as Teatro, Capo, Catch, etc...  Next time would try the 6 course tasting menu (when I am not paying...)"}
{"text":"This is a great place to go for a nice dinner with anyone who appreciates fine food and professional service. The couple of times that I have been everyone I was with loved their meals. I personally thought it was high quality with room to get better but I'm a serious foodie. The atmosphere is very calming and quiet. Anyone who is sensitive to very rich food should beware because this food certainly fits that bill. They have a pretty decent wine list for those who enjoy wine with their meals."}
{"text":"My wife and I tried Rouge for our anniversary two summers ago. Feeling adventurous, we had the tasting menu, and all I can say is...wow! Too many courses to remember, it's lost in a blur of wine pairings, foie gras, truffles, and other delightful things. Two minor gripes were street noise (we dined on the patio) and - ack! - mosquitoes. After dinner, chef/owner Paul Rogalski gave a tour of his herb garden and greenhouse. A bit on the spendy side, but like all really good things, worth the splurge."}
{"text":"My gastronomic exuberance knows no satiety!  Truly one of the best fine dining experiences I have ever had. We had the chef's tasting menu, which they were able to adapt to my food allergies  (celiac and lactarded) without compromising taste or texture - no mean feat. Normally everyone has bread to start, and I just sit there looking sad, but Rouge's house made gluten-free bun was a delicious treat. Clearly made from a combination of flours, it was moist, springy, and flavourful. The butternut squash ravioli in the rabbit jus was exquisite, each bite was a burst of incredible flavor and the savory jus complemented the squash perfectly. The braised beef cheek was the most tender thing I have ever eaten, and I cook sous vide at home. It was rich and savory without being overpowering. We also had pears poached in vanilla extract that were an experience in and of themselves. The pears were at perfect ripness, and yielded a burst of vanilla flavor when bitten into. There were several other items in the tasting, and none were a disappointment.  This is a meal to be savored over several hours. Take the time to appreciate the unique sensory experience that comes with each course - the tastes, textures, and smells are all unique and multifaceted. The service was stellar, warm but professional. The staff are extremely attentive, and pay special attention to your needs. The house itself is unique and charming, I very much enjoyed looking around."}
{"text":"My Wife and I recently went to Rouge for a date night, we've wanted to try Rouge for some time and decided that this was a good time to try.  We arrived for our 6:30 and were warmly greeted by the hostess and our coats were taken to coat check at no charge.  Once shown to our table our waiter arrived within seconds to provide us with Ice or Sparkling water.    For dinner we decided on the Chef's 6 course menu, the entire experience was amazing.  The food arrived at the perfect rate we didn't feel rushed at all but we also weren't waiting a long time between courses.    If you goto Rouge I would highly suggest doing the tasting menu as it provides a great experience of their food."}
{"text":"Un très beau et bon restaurant si vous vous trouvez sur la rive-sud! On y sert des plats asiatiques comme du général tao, etc. Tous les plats viennent en table d'hôte si vous y ajoutez 11$. Ça inclut une entrée, une soupe ou salade, le repas et un dessert. Pour ma part, j'ai adoré les rouleaux printanniers! Et mon repas était délicieux! C'était le poulet aux arachides; un vraiii délice !! Finalement, je vous suggère très fortement ls bananes frites pour le dessert. WOW  Attendez-vous à payer plus cher que si vous allez manger votre général tao en plein coeur du quartier chinois, mais le restaurant vaut la peine d'être essayer ! :)"}
{"text":"We had a fantastic experience dining at Rouge last Saturday night. It was the first time for my fiance and I, so we requested the best table available and decided to splurge on the Food & Wine pairing. So glad we did!!  Our waitress was friendly and attentive from the get go. She seated us at a beautiful table in front of the window upstairs, and I loved feeling a little spooked due to the ghost stories and sightings here. The trips to the bathroom were interesting, as that's where most sightings have occurred! The atmosphere is very mellow, in fact we were among the first to arrive for their dinner service and the silence was eerie - it did get busier throughout the night but overall I appreciated the lack of noise.  We were given ample time to peruse the menu, and decided to order cocktails to start. I trusted her to bring me something delicious, and she did not disappoint! From what I can remember, it was a martini of vodka, elderflower, and fruit juices. Very refreshing and delicious! Josh had a stout which he really enjoyed.   Once we were through with the cocktails we started with our first course. Normally I would take photos of each but I was way too excited to dive in! The amuse bouche was a beef tartare, which scared Josh a little, but he ended up loving it - it was delicious. Throughout the evening we dined on foie gras, duck, rabbit, beef tenderloin, and more. By the end of it (as per usual with wine pairings), I was a little drunk, but we devoured every bite and savoured all of the delicious flavours. It was Josh's first pairing, and we loved how the flavours of the food were complimented so well by the different kinds of wine. At the end, our server gave us a sheet listing everything we had, which was great.  I really liked that our server engaged us (without the annoying small talk you usually get) but still managed to give us privacy and ample time between courses to let our food settle. We didn't feel rushed at all, in fact we were there for over 3 hours! It was such a lovely treat to have that time to spend together, and super romantic. One of my favourite dates we've had - in fact, over a week later we're still talking about it - and salivating over the beef tenderloin course (SO GOOD!).  In closing, the service and food here is incredible, not to mention the charm and character of this historic building. It's definitely not cheap, but you get what you pay for. I wouldn't hesitate to return here for a special occasion!"}
{"text":"Not good. Sugar and salt seemingly the main ingredients in everything. It ruins everything. The salad that came with the fried squid was ruined by tons of kosher salt. The imperial rolls tasted of sugary pancake, the pad thai was tomato red and sugary. Only the steamed vegetables were ok."}
{"text":"This is easily one of my favourite restaurants in Calgary!  We have been there twice now and both times had a fabulous meal. It is an historic house situated on its own plot of land, with its own garden. The restaurant is still divided into the original rooms, which can be closed off for special events and meetings. These separate rooms also help to keep the restaurant quieter. Such a great ambiance. The only downside to this historic house is they aren't allowed to add AC, so we've been told summer time can get quite warm.   The staff is always warm and inviting. They go the extra mile for you. I'm not one to enjoy wine or beer, but the last time we were there the waiter introduced me to both a wine and beer that I would actually order. The experience here wouldn't be the same without these fantastic people!  The food is incredible. I highly recommend that you splurge on the chef's tasting menu. I have had my palate challenged and delighted with the meals here. Items that I have never liked in the past, prepared at Rouge, have left me wanting more. I have a red meat intolerance and must eat all red meat well done. At Rouge, I learnt what a properly cooked well done piece of meat is all about. My steak was juicy, flavourful and nowhere near the shoe-leather I'd experienced nearly everywhere else. It is a true skill to perfectly cook a steak well-done. Now I know a properly well-done steak is amazing! I have tried so many new foods here and they have all been fabulous!  This is the perfect place for a date!   Be prepared though, this much awesomeness does come with a higher price tag, but it is well worth it!"}
{"text":"Oh man what a lovely place. The place is itself located in a nice part of Dix30. With ample focus on the ambiance and the decor. The place is really nicely styled with the thai theme. And I also loved the red and black colors. The food itself is a bit pricey for what the quality I got. What I mean by that is when I went there during lunch hour it was pretty decent. In dinner time the menu got doubled for what I was offered for literally the same thing. I cant remember from what I ordered before, but I know they offer chicken wonton soup so its great for people who dont eat pork and sometimes miss out on the great stuff. The servers here are very experienced and really try to make your experience as positive as possible. I took lots of pictures of the decor and the place really does give you an exotic feel. This is great for any occasion for families to go out, to celebrate birthdays, anniversaries, mothers day etc etc. There was an item that my friend ordered though that I had tasted a bite from and it was too delicious. It had something to do with shrimps and noodles (but not pad thai) Anyways the next time I go visit Ill make sure to put an updated review to let you guys know what it was and how great theyre doing still.   Please dont hesitate to give this place a try as its really charming and exotic =]"}
{"text":"I had an incredible experience at Rouge no wonder making a reservation is recommended to be made days or weeks ahead. They were very accommodating about our last minute call of late arrival despite seeing after how most of their tables taken.   Anyway, our server Ryan knows was great and knows very well of the menu. We decided to have the Chef's Tasting 6-course Menu. Ryan has communicated my date's food allergies to the chef, who is very creative and was able to modify some of the courses with the restriction taken into account.   Also, I've asked for their caesar/vodka as I've heard they make a really good one. Unfortunately they have taken this off their cocktail menu for more than a year but the staff were able to have their bartender come at our table. She explained that they can make me this cocktail similar from what they used to serve (though it wont have the olive infused vodka as originally) which turned out so good!   They make so many ingredients on their menu that are home-grown or homemade like their olives, organic vegetables, butter, pesto sauce, spreads.. The cheese we were served with was apparently Canada's #1 Gouda and sure did taste the best. I cannot put into words how to describe every amazing meal they had prepared for us. Red Tuna, Foie Gras and Chicken Liver Parfait, Egg Yolk Raviolis to start were remarkable and so is our main which was the Rabit Leg Crepinette. They then surprise you with a dessert you've never prolly had anywhere else we had their Maple Pecan Butter Tart, Spiced Plum Sorbet and Lemon- Vanilla Panna Cotta. Magnifique!  Everything was well excuted. The place is very romantic and vintage. So worth what youre paying for. All the staff were exceptional. I dont know how else to describe my experience here, other's will definitely have to see and experience it for themselves."}
{"text":"Unbelievable. This was the ultimate dining experience. We're from Vancouver and have dined out rather extensively. Did the Chef tasting ($110ea) and it was worth every cent. We both really and truly have never experienced anything like it. The service was flawless and the flavors we experienced that night spanned the gamut. It was fine dining at it's very best. I honestly don't know how anyone could, or we will ever out do this night as far as the ultimate ding experience goes. Save up your coffee money & go."}
{"text":"I had the spring rolls and a spicy general tao dish. It was very good, but a little over priced for what was ordered. However, if you want a nice, elegant , and tranquille  place to eat with a group of people this is the place to go. A lot of food to choose from , just make sure you like asian food!"}
{"text":"This place in the DIX30 area of Brossard is a must-go and very popular. The food is delightful, the ambiance wonderful and the service is excellent! There are many different shrimp dishes -all are simply amazing.  Plenty of healthy choices. This place is packed just before shows at the Spectacles or @the Square.   In the summers, the terrass is open and plenty of choices tables inside: squares, circles and banquettes.  Only thing, I have never seen large groups but I'm sure they can accommodate.  We've been coming here for years and so far not disappointed. Bwtter with reservations. $$-$$$"}

Suggesting a strong focus on Alberta in their online description, the words \"regional\" and \"local\" liberally sprinkled with adjectives of self-praise to define their \"Philosophy of Fine Dining,\" Rouge is located in a residential neighborhood with ample parking along the streets, the building itself appropriately painted a deep shade of red with the interior pleasant, if not a bit stuffy, as heavy curtains and linens are flanked by vivid oil paintings.  Apologizing profusely for 'ignoring' me, a large table in the adjoining room commanding a lot of attention combined with my location and the Hostess not alerting him to my presence offered as an excuse, it was with Water and Menu in hand that choices were made, the tasting menu passed due to an odd Asian theme in a place whose style very clearly references France.  Offered two Amuses to begin the night, the second plus a later Salad presented gratis as further apology, both the Beet and Duck Liver as well as the cured Trout proved tasty and complex while a half-slice of Red Fife Sourdough was served as though it was some sort of luxury ingredient alongside grassy House-churned Butter that instead stole the spotlight.  Disappointed by Bistro Rouge's outsourced cured Meats, and again here where Elk Sausage and Bresaola are brought in with Canadian Cheeses to pair with housemade Lonza and a compact Foie Gras Torchon that proved impossible to spread on razor-thin Crostini, accoutrements including Pickled Blood Orange and Yellowfoot Mushrooms thankfully propped up the $36CAD Board, the aforementioned Salad a far better value with featuring the complex interplay of seared Sweetbreads, bright acid, tangy Yogurt and toasted Pumpkin Seeds.  Featuring the same exquisite Rougie Duck as Model Milk, but eschewing aging in favor of a plump Breast pan-Seared over ground Sunflower Seeds, Bok Choy and charred Eggplant under a tangle of Sunflower Shoots, dessert at Rouge showed similar to that at the Bistro by way of two choices, the Roasted Apple Mille-Feuille texturally compromised by 'leather' akin to a Fruit Roll-Up while the Sticky Toffee Pudding tasted like moist Spice Cake next to crumbles of Walnut and lightly-sweetened Garden Squash Ice Cream."}
{"text":"Relived honeymoon in France with family at the Rouge in Calgary recently!   It's so rare that our whole family is in the same city at the same time, but this restaurant made it a memorable experience.  We called the day before to book a reso and they were very accommodating although I wouldn't risk this again.   The wine list is a true trip through the great wine producing regions of France: St. Emillon, Pomerol, Bordeaux etc.  We had one of the Châteauneuf-du-Papes.  My sis and I started off with one of their crazy big German beers....yum. I loved my Bison \"Tortiere\" with Boozy Garden Pin Cherries appetizer, but the table ordered one of each from Octopus to Foie Gras. The main courses were equally as tantalizing...Arctic Char with Pressed Sushi Rice, I usually order fish when we go out...a popular dish at the table was the Beef Chateaubriand with a pomme puree bone marrow and Foie Gras fondue served in the bone marrow...at least you know what you're getting when it arrives!   Our waiter was friendly and very informative about : wine, food, the restaurant, folk lore about restaurants...refreshing.  A must do when in Calgary, if you can get in, as it was voted #60 best restaurant in the world...tastebud flashback to France!"}
{"text":"Food was good. Very regular. Dumplings were awesome. One complaint was waitress removed my fork and knife covered in peanut sauce that was across my plate and gave it back to me on the table because I guess she felt I didn't warrant clean ones.  That's just a pet peeve of mine. For me it's a deal breaker and a no return when that happens. I eat out 4 nights a week. Buffets do it but should be happening at $75 a person. We were 2 ppl ordered 5 dishes and bottle of wine $150 we weren't being cheap why were you?"}
{"text":"Recently took my family here for my mom's birthday. I'm pretty sure it was my parents first true French Dining experience and it was all of our first time at this restaurant. The restaurant itself is located in an old school looking house, interior decor is nothing out of the ordinary, looks like any other restaurant housed inside a house.   The service was nothing short exceptional! Started off with a dozen oysters and the Seared Foie Gras, Pork Tourtière, Boozy Cherries. The cherries were super sour and over powered the taste of the foie gras which was kind of disappointing and the only disappointing part of our meal.   My dad had the Duo of Char-grilled Alberta Lamb Chops and Moroccan Style Sausage, Garden Mint Couscous, brother's gf has the Duet of Pork Tenderloin and Crispy Smoked Ham Hock, Rhubarb Sauce, Brown Rice \"Risotto\" and may I say the risotto was DELICIOUS, my mom and i shared the AAA Alberta Beef Chateaubriand (For Two), Bone Marrow and Foie Gras Spring Roll, Potato Rösti, the beef was super tender, the spring roll was very tasty! Never had bone marrow and foie gras combined together. Brother had the Smoked High Country Bison Striploin Medallions, Raisin Bread Panade, Madeira Cream, everyone seemed to enjoy their meals thoroughly.    I will definitely be back but not on an often basis, as I wouldl go broke faster then Greece."}
{"text":"Excellent service!!.. Probably one of the best I have had in Calgary!!.. In addition the food was very very good, and the wine was great!!.. Even when is not the best French restaurant I have been... I have to say is very good... I didn't like the parking lot of the restaurant, and the ambience is not very fancy, neither the location..."}
{"text":"We enjoy trying new restaurants and this was our first visit to Rouge. The two stars are for the halibut and waygu which were both fantastic. However the Service and atmosphere was stuffy and uncomfortable. Hearing the servers using the same rehearsed jokes table after table, it misses an authenticity to it. We've experienced \"fine dining\" at many restaurants, but this one didn't do the trick for us."}
{"text":"Outstanding. Have been there many times & it has always been stellar! My favorite in Calgary... And there are some v good spots here. Menu has some wonderful subtle blends of flavors. Very nice private rooms for groups -which we have booked a few times. Oh dear, this is starting to sound like I have a vested interest but I have none... apart from seeing great restaurants succeed."}
{"text":"I know this restaurant is one of the great landmarks of Inglewood, and I can really see why. Like many businesses in older parts of Calgary, it was converted from an old Victorian home. Rob & I have had the pleasure of discussing the possibility of a wedding rehearsal dinner with them, though it is very pricey. We found even when we politely declined due to the prices, the head chef we spoke with was still very friendly with us. I know they produce gourmet food here. On one occasion last summer I was going door-to-door with my Avon samples in Inglewood, and it was a hot day so I finished early. I thought I'd take a chance and ask at Rouge if they'd let me leave the samples at the front desk, but he did better than that: He encouraged me to walk through to the gardens out back and personally give them to a lady at a table. I thought, \"wow that's great customer service even when I'm not ordering a meal\".  The food is top-notch, the people are awesome and the location is trendy :)"}
