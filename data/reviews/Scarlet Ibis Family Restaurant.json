{"text":"I ordered delivery for two from Scarlet Ibis 3 months ago while I was busy moving, so I didn't write a review right away. But I wanted to make sure I came back to write one because the food was pretty damn good. I actually regret finding them only right before I was about to move away!

We got the stew chicken with a *lot* of fried plantain. Basically fried plantain is one of my favourite things in the world. But there's nothing worse than when plantain is made the wrong way. No issues here though!!! :) Their fried plantain was delicious, succulent, perfectly cooked. I was very happy! The chicken was delicious as well. Next time I'm in the area I'll be glad to try other dishes from the menu."}
{"text":"My cousin has been going here for years and has been quite satisfied . She introduced me a while back and I thought the food was fairly well done. It is considered West Indian cuisine / Chinese. The owners are from Guyana but the food is similar to trini style also.

Your level of satisfaction will depend on what you order. My favorites are Shrimp Wantons , Fried Plantain , paratha roti with Stewed chicken and also the beef soup.

Service isn't amazing and food can take a while. Interior is fairly dim and somewhat retro but I do not think it takes away from the experience and somewhat mirrors what you'd find back in WI.

Also note they offer a buffet for around 9-11$ for lunch. All in all I'd say it's worth a try for sure and depending on your tastes you may really enjoy it."}
{"text":"To say I was disappointed is an understatement
I used to frequent Tropical Nights on the Danforth years ago and was craving a carabean buffet.  After reading the reviews for this place I got so excited to have the buffet. My mouth was drooling week long just thinking about it.    We drove all the was from the west end to try the place.  The cook up rice was good but that's it.  The food was stale and lacking flavor. 
We were all VERY Sadly disappointed"}
{"text":"I've been here a few times since my first review and I haven't been disappointed. I've tried the lamb and duck curries (and roti), BBQ pork, fried chicken, and all of the combos, possibly another thing or two.

Still highly recommended!"}
{"text":"Good food but weird location. Lots of seating, average customer service, TVs to watch games, and a small buffet they have almost if not everyday from 12-3 I believe. Could do with some renovations or a makeover. Not very kid friendly though as they have pictures of scantily dressed women behind the bar. 

I don't come here often but when I do it's for takeout."}
{"text":"Amazing Amazing Amazing...I'm Guyanese, so maybe I'm biased, but the food is great, service is great, just plain everything. My sister used to come here 24/7 before introducing the rest of our family to this restaurant. I'm now in love with it. You won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Delectable rotis -  potato/spinach/pumpkin filled awesomeness. Killer pepper shrimp and plantains with a side of coconut ice cream. Always good and ready to go on time no matter how busy they get.  I'm lucky enough to work nearby but will also travel from home for some takeout on the weekend."}
{"text":"Located in a hidden area of Victoria Park and O'Connor, this Guyanese - Chinese restaurant is a good spot for a quick meal if you're close by. It's not worth a long drive. The food quality and selection is on par with other restaurants of this type in the area. It differs with choices like goat curry, stew chicken, and miscellaneous cake slices for dessert."}
