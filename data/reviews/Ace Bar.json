{"text":"The Good: decent size meals, relatively quick service (when you can get a waiter).

The Bad: I really feel they're trying to rip off people, especially now in Montreal's tourist season: notice on your bill, they are automatically giving themselves 18% tips.  When I asked the waiter what's the deal with that, he got very defensive and said they're trying to HELP us since many don't know how much to tip.  He even added they'll have to pay tax on the tip.  Not sure if they know it's illegal to make customers pay for something not agreed upon in advance.

Anyway, there are definitely, definitely better places in the hood, so I'll never go back there if I can avoid it."}
{"text":"Save yourself the time to visit this Restaurant in Montreal Canada.The food was fair, the service was a disgrace."}
{"text":"If you want to have a quick business meal well I guess it passes, seems like a dinner that's been around for a while and has not updated their menu in 20 years (which is not always bad but in this case the food doesn't back but up). On the plus side they seem to have a good pizza.
To sum it up sub-average food, nothing special about it"}
{"text":"Not $$, it's $. There are 3 sections in three separate areas. Really this should be three separate Yelp entries. 1. A comfy bar lounge with Touchtunes and tv's and a great 2-for-1 happy hour. 2. A deli, good for family. 3. A restaurant, good for family. So when I search for a bar or restaurant, this doesn't show up. I think it's a great spot."}
{"text":"Was here as part of a group tour. There was a set menu with a couple of different entree options. The steak was overcooked but the rest of the food was decent. The portions were much smaller than expected in American restaurants, to be expected though... 

The service was absolutely terrible. The waiters were rude and made everyone feel as if we were inconveniencing them by being there. Our waiter even yelled at everyone and said he didn't want to have to repeat himself. The delivery was completely unorganized and poorly timed. 

I would definitely not recommend eating here."}
{"text":"ive ate here twice in montreal  this place is pretty decent... i loved the pooteen lol ... everything was really fresh and quick to be served! the roast beef on a roll was outstanding!!!"}
