{"text":"Even if you've never liked Falafel before, you should still get one here.   Falafel can be done wrong in all kinds of ways. It can be bland, burnt or greasy. Or worse, bland, burnt and greasy.   But not at Maha's. Fresh hot oil, and the best falafel paste known to mankind make for one of my favorite dishes in all of Cleveland.  Here's a secret: They sell their falafel paste! So you can try frying this at home, and impress dinner guests."}
{"text":"I don't really want to tell you how far out of my way I will drive to eat this falafel. It's definitely the best I've ever had. There have been times when I have gone to the West Side Market and I've gotten a falafel sandwich (with a little hot sauce) and something else to share with a friend, and I've always been sad that I didn't just have a whole falafel sandwich.  I think I'm going to come here on Saturday. If I could go today, I would."}
{"text":"Great chicken philly for lunch. Cooked and seasoned to perfection...  the pita bread....YUM.  A little pricey when you add french fries.....other than that, love it!"}
{"text":"Since moving to London from Cleveland a few years back, there are many foods from home I find myself craving, from blueberry doughnuts to cassata cake; frozen custard to grilled cheese from Melt.  However, Maha's falafel remains at the top of my list.  I cannot visit home without stopping at the West Side Market at least twice to enjoy a falafel.  Sure, we have falafel in London, but it all pales in comparison to Maha's.  I've even eaten falafel from L'as du Falafel in Paris, which is rumored to be the best falafel in the world.  Guess what, Maha's is better!   Picture it: perfect, fried to order, crispy falafels with a moist interior, composed of just the right blend of spices and seasonings, doused liberally in some of the finest tahini known to mankind, and all wrapped up in a soft, delicious pita.  I can't resist the lure of the Jumbo, even though I always feel slightly too full after wolfing it down, but oh man, it is well worth any stomachache.  And the staff are always efficient and friendly, and don't skimp on packing those pitas full to bursting. A must try for anyone visiting Cleveland."}
{"text":"Maha's, you have completely spoiled me. I can no longer eat falafel anywhere else. Even as a meat lover with so many tempting options, I can no longer visit the west side market without ordering a falafel with hot sauce. Oh, the moments we have shared!  -Forever yours, Nicole K."}
{"text":"Well falafel tastes the same pretty much always but the way a wrap makes it come together is what separates it from mediocre to exceptional. The falafel here are mixed with supreme toppings and absolutely phenomenal sauce and drizzle. The hummus is also really good, making it the icing on the cake. It's also pretty cheap! I recommend you to try their food!"}
{"text":"OK. Let's put this into perspective... there have been 10 people before me who gave this a 5 star rating... 10. And with me it's 11. Like, if you look at the rating profile of this place... it has one line. On the 5 star rating. One line. One rating. 5 stars.   People. Stop reading this review and go to Maha's for a Falafel Wrap. Like now!  Well ok... maybe not NOW now... Westside Market is only open a couple of days a week. But when it's open. Seriously. . . .   Ok.... you're still reading. Which means the 11 (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11... yes... 11) continuous (not a single 4 or three star in there) 5 star ratings have not convinced you. Seems I am going to have to do it the hard way.   First, let me establish my credentials... As a falafel connoisseur, I have eaten falafels in Boston, New York, Seattle, Los Angeles, Italy, Romania, Abu Dhabi, Dubai, France, India and a multitude of other place. And I know what an Ideal falafel should taste and feel like. Crunchy on the ouside, perfectly cooked on the inside, spiced just right (a dash too much of anything ruins the balance). Then you need to ideal tahini and the correct level of spiciness...   And boy, does this place get it right. I would go on for ages about the beautiful tahini, the delectable hummus or the abso-frgging-lutely perfect falafels.. all wrapped into this amazing pita roll. I mean they make it all fresh. Like you can see them sculpting the individual falafels and then frying it in front of you (my mouth is watering as I type this).  And how much does this all cost... $5.75 for the special.  The closest I have come to a falafel as good as this place was made by an illegal Isrealy guy in Venice who had a little falafel stand near the Rialto Bridge.   Seriously people... if you have not tried Mahas... try it. You will love it. (bring cash - they don't do credit cards)"}
{"text":"AMAZING FALAFEL WRAP. MUST HAVE. I ordered the regular sized Falafel, Hummus and Tabouli wrap this previous Saturday. The flavor was amazing. My friend who was very skeptical of falafel tried it and loved it. The falafel itself is more \"grainy\" textured, but in the best way. By far the best falafel I have had. Then the bread they put it on is so soft.  Two days later, I brought the other half of this wrap into work for lunch. A DELICIOUS, filling wrap that last for two meals for only $5.40?? I am wondering why I don't go here everyday."}
{"text":"Haven't had better falafel served as fast and to order. Love this place. Try the falafel wrap loaded and spicy.   I just had the falafel breakfast wrap with egg (over easy) and cheese with siracha... Hoh boy. A true legend of breakfast sandwiches but in a wrap."}
{"text":"Good lord this place is fantastic.  \"Falafel wrap with hummus extra spicy\" is my standard cry on a Saturday afternoon.  I've eaten quite a few falafels in my time and this place is tough to beat.  If you think Aladdin's is good (I think Aladdin's is just okay) give this place a shot.  You'll never set foot in the big A again."}
{"text":"So worth it! Short wait (not like Steve's Gyros) and a falafel you won't regret getting. Super packed with flavors for only $6....and I love how they added crispy french fries in it! NOMS all day."}
{"text":"THE BEST FALAFELS I'VE EVER HAD. I dream of their falafels even after having moved to Philly three years ago. These guys know how to do one thing spectacularly well, and they make the most flavorful, aromatic, crisp, fresh falafels. This alone is worth the trip to the west side market."}
{"text":"Crazy Crispy Falafel at it's best!!!  Great texture and flavor all wrapped into a great sandwich. It's all about the crisp outside and tender inside. My new favorite Falafel!! Slammer!!!"}
{"text":"Best falafel in Cleveland. It is especially nice in the spring and summer to sit outside of the market on a bench and enjoy a falafel. Make sure that you get extra hot sauce."}
{"text":"Best falafel I've had in a long time. It takes me back to my younger years in Lebanon. Highly recommend this place to anyone!"}
{"text":"Are you frightened by the ridiculous line for Steve's Gyros? Then take 20 steps away and enjoy some of Maha's Falafels!! The service is friendly and quick!! I love getting the hot falafel wrap with hummus. For less than $5, you cannot go wrong with this savory and filling item! They also have an array of other items to choose from, like philly cheese steak (yupp, super random). I'm looking forward to trying other items on the menu! :)"}
{"text":"As much as I want to right a lengthy review about how delicious the falafil is and how you need to try this place. I will just leave you with a few sentences. This place is great. The food is unbelievable. The price is also unbelievable. The workers are fun and attentive. Seriously what are you doing if you are in Cleveland and you are not currently eating here. If you are somewhere else, drop that bland generic food and get here immediately. You will not regret!"}
{"text":"Get to Maha's, people!  Such delicious and fresh falafel!  Having grown up eating my grandmother's and father's fantastic cooking, I have too high of standards for Middle Eastern food. Two things I love but am rarely satisfied with when eating out are falafel and baba ghannouj (actually I never even bother ordering baba because too many places just dump it out of a can).  Great to see that they mold the falafel right after you order so it's as fresh as can be.  I got the falafel and baba ghannouj wrap with spicy sauce added and all of it was absolutely delicious.  I devoured the entire thing and will definitely be back.  What a shame that I hadn't tried this place before."}
{"text":"Falafel were good, but I've definitely had better. Thought they were a bit dry actually. Dolma had very little seasoning, and the hummus lacking zing (lemon and garlic) IMO."}
{"text":"It's easy to overlook Maha's, tucked away in a little corner of the West Side Market.  Don't.  This place is great.  The falafel is fantastic-- and I'm a carnivore.  Shwarma is excellent, my kids love their fish sandwich.  Grab some pita, hummus & baba to take home.  It's all good."}
{"text":"This is simple enough. The actual falafel is some of the best, and not just in cleveland. It's really just a great product. It's always fried to order, too. And the woman there is really nice. Their babaganoush is a bit too garlicky, but it's forgiven because of the quality of the falafel. Don't try anything else there (like the shawarma products)."}
{"text":"The food was great! However, we waited for 20 minutes. There was no line, but we were told they needed to take care of the catering order first. After 20 minutes, I went up and asked for a refund, instead of giving me one the lady behind the counter refused, gave me an attitude and yelled to make my food. Horrible service!"}
{"text":"I could eat at this place every day.  My wife and I don't visit Cleveland often so we looked to Yelp for some recommendations of where to eat and we were not let down.  The falafel is just as good as any that I've ever had.  I ordered a falafel wrap and every bite was heavenly.  I really don't like tomatoes at all and they were in the wrap, but I still ate it because it was so good even the tomatoes couldn't ruin it.  The staff was great too."}
{"text":"MAN OH MAN, BE PREPARED FOR THE BEST AND FRESHEST FALAFEL'S YOU CAN FIND ANYWHERE. In Seattle, Greek/Mediterranean food is not hard to come by. It can be found anywhere, done well. But the falafel's at Maha's were mindblowing. So hot, perfectly crisp on the outside and warm and fluffy on the inside. Delicious and compliment by the pita fixings. Wonderful and quick service. Great prices. Maha move to Seattle please! Will come back if we're ever in Cleveland again."}
{"text":"The guy behind the counter is a handsome devil! (He told me to say that) The fries were delish though!! The customer service is always great which is always a plus for me!"}
{"text":"Located inside the West Side Market, Maha's Falfafil has a big, affordable menu of chicken wraps, veggie wraps, lamb/fish wraps and platters. Be ready - they are CASH ONLY!  We ordered a falafel platter (comes with falafel, lettuce, pita, tomato, tabouli, and hummus) and a chicken shawarma wrap. The chicken shawarma wrap had great colors and presentation, but sadly had no flavor. It needed sauce or seasoning, or even just lemon on it. If you get it, add hummus to it. Otherwise its quite plain.  We loved the Falafil, Hummus and Tabouli Platter. The falafel was excellent - crispy and fried on the outside, soft and tasty on the inside! It was some of my favorite falafel I've ever tried in Cleveland. The platter itself was super healthy and inexpensive ($8). I could picture myself ordering this all the time. It was filling and colorful and I didn't feel sluggish after lunch. I'm not a vegetarian, but I always appreciate a place that makes me want to eat my veggies! I'll be back and sticking with the falafel dishes!"}
{"text":"I want to start off by saying that I usually don't care for falafels; they tend to be dry and lacking of any bold flavors. This was not the case for the falafels here. I had the falafel & hummus wrap and it was absolutely delicious. The giveaway would be the line of people waiting for their orders. The lady cashier was not very warm, which is not unusual when the place is this popular. I got the regular while my friend got the jumbo. It didn't look to me like there was a very big difference in the sizes. But that aside, I was super excited to have found a falafel place this delicious! Will definitely return"}
{"text":"Good shopping food.   Girls who work the stand are super cool.  All the hippies and pseudo punk rawkers love this place...guess thats how they fit in pants my little sister would wear.."}
{"text":"I don't understand why this place is over rate. The is just OK nothing special! People is not friendly here."}
{"text":"yup -- the best falafil in town  i'm always trying falafils, whenever i come across one, and, in cleveland, maha's are the best"}
{"text":"Amazing staff amazing food always served fresh and with a smile. Makes my day every time I stop in. Keep up the great work, all businesses at the West Side Market should be this great!"}
{"text":"This place is filthy! How can they serve food out of somewhere like this?! It looks like some dirty corner of a Metro station.  I hope at least the equipment used for the food-making is clean. I'm sure it is. And the people. One guy was walking around with BAGS tied around his foot. Plastic BAGS. Get civilized already. He looked like he belongs in a corner of some Metro station too.   Oh. None of that actually matters. The only thing that matters here is the the food quality. Plus I didn't even care that it looked liked a homeless hideout. Hence the five stars. Falafel in Pita with Baba Ghanouch (cooked eggplant). A random lady was walking past and stopped to ask if it was good. I just looked at her, my falafel filled mouth hanging open. \"Excuse me, ma'am. If this is merely good, then all other food is bad. This is Far Beyond good.\"   Man, why didn't I get another one."}
{"text":"Wow. Falafel is always good, in any form, but Maha's is just incredible. The hummus is great, the veg are fresh, the falafel is hot and delicious! It's a must-stop after a morning perusing the market. Bonus: it also carries well, too. Eat it in Ohio City, or enjoy its still steaming goodness when you get home."}
{"text":"Great falafel, moist inside, crispy outside. Only problem was the sriracha sauce they pit on it, which is sweet and hot. No place for sugar on a falafel.   The bearded, baseball-capped guy assembling orders also had to keep walking away from his station to read orders over the shoulder of the woman at the register. Poor workflow. Then he'd walk back to his station staring into space."}
{"text":"Thanks to never being featured on TV, this is a somewhat hidden gem at the Market. I've honestly never tried anything except the falafel, so I can't speak to the other options. I love all types of tasty animal flesh, yet this may well be the best sandwich in Cleveland. Explosively flavorful, absolutely fresh (fresh ground, freshly chopped herbs, fried to order and served on a local pita), this sandwich has made me forsake the outstanding brat sandwich, gyro, and kielbasa available at other stands. It is a must for vegans, vegetarians, and carnivores alike. The family-run business also features service that's fast and friendly... you just have to wait for your perfect chick pea patties to get crispy."}
{"text":"Maha's Falafel serves the best falafel I've ever eaten. The top falafel restaurant in Cleveland.  Better than falafel that I've had in New York, Philadelphia, Cincinnati, and Washington DC.    The pita bread is soft and fresh.  The falafel is fried perfectly - browned on the outside, but not burnt.  Inside, the falafel is soft and tasty.  Great hummus.  Plenty of fresh vegetables.    I'll admit that I haven't tried anything else on the menu, mainly because the falafel is so good that I have to order it when I'm there.  Maha's alone makes a trip to West Side Market worthwhile.  Bring cash, they don't accept credit cards."}
{"text":"fry crisp, my chickpea,  your crunchy goodness delights carnivores as well.  Maha's Felafel in the northeast corner of the Westside Market serves up the best felafel I have ever had.  Made to order, crispy and spicy goodness.  I also prefer the gyro to \"Steve's Gyro\" in the market.  Maha's gives you freshly made and seasoned meat that, again, is cooked to order, and much tastier than the one featured on Man vs Food, or whatever show that featured it.   Quality vs. quantity... Carry on."}
{"text":"If you find yourself wandering through the WSM, wondering why it smells like a shuk (Middle Eastern market), keep walking until you reach the back.  One falafel sandwich and you'll understand why Maha's, according to the woman running the operation, has been tucked away there for 30 years.  The falafel is soft, flavorful, and crispy.  They fry it on the spot with thick chips (french fries)!  Into fresh, soft pita they both go, accompanied by a slather of hummus-tahina and a couple of pickled radishes.  Israeli salad (dices cukes and tomatoes) is not part of this scheme, but the whole mess is still filling, delicious, and for $6, all around unbeatable.  Get some!"}
{"text":"What can I say that hasn't already been said?  I always get the same thing because its delicious. Falafel and hummus wrap with extra hot sauce and extra pickled stuff. Sometimes, a drink, sometimes a spinach pie. The people that work here are awesome, and you can tell how much hard work they put into their food.   The wrap itself is just the perfect portion for me to feel full, but not disgusting. Just thinking about it is making my mouth water. Its a monday... maybe I should stop at the market :-)"}
{"text":"I landed in Cleveland at 6:45am and this was my first stop!  When I lived in Cleveland I used to come three times a month to get falafel here!  I moved to Las Vegas five years ago 2/2011 and every single time I come back this is the first place that I stop!  It is the best falafel I have ever had in my entire life.  It is nostalgic and historic in Cleveland Ohio.  And every single time I walk in here they remember me like it was yesterday!  Not only is it the best falafel I've ever had in my life and the best customer service it is the most ethnic mom and pop deliciously made with love sandwich!   I need to say it's in the most gorgeous beautiful farmers market I have ever been to in my life!  BRING A CAMERA!  Also it's cash only!! I repeat BRING A CAMERA!"}
{"text":"Maha's makes fresh Lebanese-style falafel to order in their stall, and is a perfect snack to enjoy while walking around and shopping at West Side Market. Those little balls are always hot and delicious! Strangely, the hummus and baba seem to be the same quality as the mass-produced supermarket stuff, which is extremely disappointing, but not enough of a problem to deter me from visiting. Pita is just ok. Skip the platter or sandwich and just get plain falafel with tahina for dipping. You won't regret it!"}
{"text":"Sometimes falafel can be hard.... like little golf balls wrapped in pita.  Not at \"Maha's Falafel\" however.  This falafel was soft and fresh and WONDERFUL!  The pita bread it was served on was very fresh as well.  It was served quickly and the people behind the counter were friendly and efficient.  The reason for it not being a \"5 star\" experience is that I was asked if I'd like it spicy and I said \"yes\".  Well, it was.... but the sauce was more of a hot sauce out of a bottle (like a red pepper sauce) than a Middle Eastern spice blend.  It was kind of strange and not very \"authentic\".  Tasty, but not exactly what I was expecting."}
{"text":"I got the regular sized falafel wrap with hummus and tabouli. I've got nothing but good things to say about it. It was delicious. The falafel was so good - crispy, fresh, flavorful, didn't feel chock full of oil. Honestly, I wanted to eat just the falafel by itself, but I didn't see an option on the menu for just a bag of falafels. The hummus and tabouli were good with the wrap, gave it a creamy texture with a sour balance. $5.25 for what I got.   Also, some people have mentioned in their reviews that the cashier lady isn't very friendly. I didn't notice that because I just gave me order with no problems and just waited for my wrap. There was another guy there giving out falafel samples dipped in hummus who was friendly though."}
{"text":"No Frills Needed.  There's not much to see at Maha's Cafe, but plenty to taste! This Cash-Only, Counter-Service Falafel Mecca tucked into the Northeast corner of the West Side Market will knock your socks off with wraps cooked to order: the crispest falafel, creamiest hummus, and freshest tabouli you will taste, all wrapped into a $5 treat that you can hold in your hand as you peruse the wares of the Market! It adds up to the best bang for your buck in WSM snacks, as far as I am concerned. 5 stars!"}
{"text":"The stuff of dreams.... If I could eat this everyday I could. One of the most unassuming places, Maha's is shoved into a hallway in a corner of the Westside Market. Their falafel is hands-down the best I've ever had, and as you can see by the other reviewers, this is unanimous.  I usually get the falafel and hummus platter and it is always hot, fresh, and delicious. They only take cash so be prepared!"}
{"text":"Delicious delectable falafel. Better than my possibly wrong spelling of words. Very good falafel! or as my auto-correct would have it - Rafaela! But the first time I went, I didn't know what was on it! So I didn't really enjoy it. I don't care, but I like my falafel, or \"Fella\" (thank you auto-correct) without wilty disgusting lettuce! (Not that the quality of the lettuce is in question, but on a falafel pita all steaming hot... well... steamed hot lettuce no thank you.) I like mine with parsley, pickled turnip, tomato and tahini so the next time I asked for this. Lo and behold they didn't have any parsley or tabbouleh. No problem! The next time - they did. So don't be afraid to ask what usually comes and then just ask and be pleased. (It's kinda awkward to ask sometimes cause there is a huge line maybe, and then everyone knows except you) but it was real good. Aw gosh I'm hungry."}
{"text":"If I could be assured that all of my meals would be as delicious as the falafel-hummus wraps I get at Maha's, I would seriously consider becoming a vegetarian!"}
