{"text":"Went for brunch.  Very good food and service. Nice cabin feel upstairs. Liked the yogurt starter with fresh berries. Will definitely return."}
{"text":"Le 5@7 du jeudi soir, c'est vraiment la cohue!! Pour un groupe, il est impératif de faire une réservation (ce que nous avions fait).  L'ambiance est canon, les bouchées à partager aussi!   Un superbe endroit à Ste-Rose!"}
{"text":"I came to \"Le Boating Club\" for a work related X-mas supper on a Friday night (table of 12).   Overall, I enjoyed my experience. Service all night long was exceptional. Our waitress was attentive and friendly and consistently delivered all night long. I always expect service to be impacted when going to a resto with a group of significant size but I'd be glad to report they had no issues.  We had a variety of dishes and they were all good. Nothing really stood out for me to be amazing but they were all enjoyable. I had 3 pear cocktails, they however were delicious!  Le Boating Club has a huge bar and the bar scene starts to happen pretty early, as of 9 PM the bar was 5 bodies deep everywhere with ladies and gents chatting/flirting it up hard core. Some of the ladies here are coming in dressed for seduction, so gentlemen, mark your engines.  A few cons :   - Parking is a nuisance, very small and they have a valet.  - As the bar picks up, it gets VERY LOUD. You can barely hear anything distinct a few feet from you.  Nice place. Will be back one day for breakfast."}
{"text":"Wow, really impressed with this place.  Felt like I was downtown and didn't even have to leave Laval.  Great food, drinks and atmosphere on a Saturday night.  We had a set menu for $40/prs and the food didn't stop coming! Highly recommended."}
{"text":"Went to Le boating club for a birthday supper with some friends.  We started with the burrata and tuna tartar which were really palatable.  Then had the mushroom gnocch, jerk chicken, and braised beef were very tasty but a little too salty. We had the passion fruit and chocolate mousse with with Churro balls which I found underwhelming.  Over all loved the experience but won't be quick to come back."}
{"text":"je suis aller pour le brunch  pas impressionné pour 2 uf une tranche bacon une petite saucisse  petite portion de bean ah oui patate aussi  un petit mais très petit yogourt  pour 17 dollars hummm ca vaut pas ça dommage les autres avec moi on trouvé ça chère pour ce que c'est   j aimais la place, je dois dire les serveur souriants le service courtois mais j ai vue mieux a moins chère je payerais ça chez Regine café on dirait que avoir du style rime avec crash le cash cou donc ce n'est que un petit déjeuner bien simple dommage peu être que le soir c'est meilleur je dénigrerais pas la place pour le restant mais pour un petit déjeuner je vous laisse le choix"}
{"text":"Great option for good food if you live in the Laval area. Try the coxinhas as an appetizer; it's like a fried up taco ball. Their pear mojito is just fab! All 4 of us loved it. They also serve brunch I believe so I'll be checking that out quite soon.  Note: we went on a Thursday night and if got a bit rowdy and very loud.  FYI: they have a great little private room downstairs perfect for private events."}
