{"text":"Stopped in to try the breakfast and was very impressed with the owner, very friendly . l had the sausage and eggs toast coffee and was very good, I would recommend this restaurant, fast on service and friendly."}
{"text":"Always great service with a smile and friendly conversation. Great food for a great price and huge portions. I recommend this place to everyone."}
{"text":"Heard about this place through a friend of a friend. Being a foodie, I'm always into trying new restaurants so my boyfriend and I grabbed lunch.   Finding this place is like finding gold.   When we first walked in, the owner greeted us immediately. He was so friendly and kind.   My boyfriend ordered chicken and rice and I opted for the burger and fries as that's my go to when I'm overwhelmed by so many delicious options!   The chicken was deliciously seasoned and fell right off the bone. My burger was juicy and tender, and huge! We were given huge portions and our bill was only $20! You really get a bang for your buck.   I'm definitely going to be a regular customer."}
{"text":"Found this place through justeats. Ordered jerk chicken, bbq chicken, fish and chips and a side of rice. ALL AMAZING. Big portions. Definitely recommend eating and tasting the food!"}
{"text":"This place just opened up a month ago. It's where the old KFC used to be. The wonder greeted us with nothing but courtesy and smiles and reckoned we try his chicken. So we ordered the 2 can dine meal for like $13. Crazy price if you ask me! We ordered one dark and white portion just cause. I'm always hesitant getting chicken breast as it is easy to cook it dry, but I was definitely impressed at how juicy and tasty the BBQ chicken was here. I'm not sure if the sauce was house made but damn, it was good. The sides came in a hefty portion. I opted for a Greek salad and my gf opted for a poutine. Both were real good. For 13$ you can't beat that price. Good chicken, good sides and sodas. I'll be coming back here for the breakfast and whatever else. Kudos to the owner for being super friendly and for the delicious chicken!"}
{"text":"this is my 2nd visit here.  I ordered the basa fish and chips and my wife ordered the grilled chicken sandwich, we ordered home fries on the side.  Friendly service, relatively quick service, bottom-less soft drink available.  Fish was good, the way I like it, tartar sauce not in packets yaay!  The grilled chicken sandwich is a bit steep in price, my wife's comment on the grilled chicken is that it wasn't anything special..considering the price of the dish.  The home fries (were over cooked) and regular fries were a bit saltier then we prefer.  Since the fries are coated fries, not sure if no salt on the fries is possible.  We will be making another visit to try out their chicken and 1/2 rib special.  Fair price for fish and chips at least.  Wish extra fish was an option."}
{"text":"I was skeptical when I noticed a new restaurant had taken over the old KFC location, but was pleasantly surprised when I had the chance to stop in when looking for dinner on short notice. I had my meal at dinner on new year's eve before heading out for the night so the restaurant was empty, though I do notice regular flow of customers around dinner time on my way home from work.  Looking at the menu I noticed some similarity to items you'd find at Swiss Chalet so I chose to do a somewhat of a comparison. I ordered a white meat 1/4 chicken dinner with a poutine side. The meal came within a short amount of time and was nice and warm.  The particular things I liked about my meal were that the fries were really good. They were very crispy and didn't get super soggy under the poutine's gravy. Additionally, while Swiss Chalet cooks their chickens in a rotisserie, Golden Swiss barbecues their chickens and the sauce they use had just the right amount of sweetness and tang to it. Finally, I must comment on the service. The owner, who served me, was very warm and welcoming and attended to my order promptly. Every interaction he made with me, he had a smile on his face and even said he'd accommodate my early work schedule so I could grab breakfast since I most enjoy American diner style breakfasts.  At the end of the day I would say I was quite content with my visit and I would for sure make a return visit. The only disadvantage I see for Golden Swiss is being tucked away on Neilson and not prominently on display to passersby."}
{"text":"Owner is super nice! And the food is amazing! Price was amazing and fast delivery !!! Thanks again"}
{"text":"This is not a fancy restaurant, but it's a sweet little Mom & Pop type place where the food is yummy and very hearty.  The owner served us himself with a friendly smile and constantly checked with us to be sure we were happy with our meal and had everything we needed.    We had the chicken & ribs special.  The Ribs just fall off the bone and chicken was also very tasty.  The portion sizes are huge and the prices more than fair!  Try the coconut cream pie, it's out of this world."}
{"text":"Unpretentious but tasty, family run restaurant, serving simple North American diner foods with a few additions. Based on only a single experience: food not overly oily and ingredients seem to be of good quality."}
{"text":"Very nice ribs and wings.  My friend had a cheeseburger and fries. Good quality good at very reasonable prices. I'll be coming back for lunch on a regular basis. Congratulations on your first year in business."}
{"text":"Great place to eat if your passing by. As a Montrealer, I really appreciated the poutine and the Ribs were to die for!!"}
{"text":"It was my first time to eat today. It's a small place but there's a variety of food to choose from. I ordered chicken and ribs combo. It tastes great considering the good price. The combo includes fries, coleslaw and a tasty smooth bread. The owner is also a very  nice guy with excellent customer's service. This place is a gem in the boonies."}
{"text":"They have their good points and bad. Cheap lunch specials with friendly staff.  Awkward location: you need to turn onto Neilson Road and drive to the back of the plaza. Look for the green \"Deliveries\" sign next to the \"Stop\" sign and park in the back parking lot.  Not all items on the menu are available (jambalaya rice, butternut squash soup), staff will let you know what was discontinued. Ordered the Southern Frank (bass) Fish which came with fries and the Jerk Chicken which came with \"mixed rice\" (not on their online menu).  The fish was actually decent with a crispy cornmeal breading and flaky, moist fish. The jerk chicken tasted old; it was dry and very spicy (I had to scrape most of the spices off). The \"mixed rice\" was fluffy and flavorful. Not sure we'll be back unless hubby wants the fish again and we're in the area."}
{"text":"Closed now. As it should be. Wasn't very good.  I do hope we can get something good in this location. The best food in this neighbourhood is sold at the hospital. That is sad"}
{"text":"I recently came across this place when I decided to order from the JUST EAT app. I must say at first it was odd that this restraint had such a variety of foods. I ordered the Butternut Squash soup which was BEYOND delicious as well as the fish and chips, which i must say was also above average. At the time these meals were delivered to me but WOW, i am def going to head into this restaurant for an out of the kitchen experience."}
{"text":"Great prices for great food! The owner is a very genuine person who served us himself and was very attentive to us if we needed anything. While obviously not a high end restaurant, this place is a great hidden gem that serves amazing food at an amazing price.   I ordered the bacon cheeseburger with coleslaw and fries and my partner ordered the quarter chicken with poutine. The servings were bigger than we expected, especially for the price and we both thoroughly enjoyed our meals! Will definitely come back and highly recommend if you're looking for a quick bite."}
{"text":"Get the chicken and ribs special with Caesar salad. Really tasty and generous portions! Great service! Owner worked at swiss chalet for 20 years and then opened up this cute mom and pop shop!"}
{"text":"My friend has been raving to me about this restaurant how great it was. I must admit it was very nice. Everything was suburb from the meal to customer service. I was impressed. I will be definitely be returning."}
{"text":"A great little joint that serves affordable hearty meals. The owner was our server and he let my kids order from the breakfast menu during lunch time. I like that their menu is diverse and that they serve pub food as well as ethnic foods like jerk chicken. The portions are huge and I think the service is wonderful."}
{"text":"The restaurant is around the corner on Nielson rd. Where the KFC used to be (if you knew the area for a while). The one at the cash (I think the manager) was so kind and welcoming. I just stopped by to grab food for my dad and he was so patient (maybe cause no one else was lined up?) while I was on the phone. I got the fish n chips Thursday Special for 8.99 + .49c (Greek salad side) plus tax which came to 10.71. My dad complained that there was no napkins but that's really a given from him. I forgot to ask anyway. I tried a piece and it was yummy. The fish pieces (2) were big and it comes with coleslaw. The salad is a big portion too. I asked my dad what he'd rate it but he said he has to finish it first. Lol well this is my rating! Only missing a star because my dad was being all  about the napkins. Thank you! I'll be back!"}
{"text":"We came in starving, but the friendly owner was quick to solve that problem! My friend and I ordered the specials off the board and were both very happy with our chicken and ribs!  The chicken wings were both crispy and saucy and the 1/4 chicken was so juicy.  Everything tastes fresh and came quickly, and the whole place has a nice family feel.  We were so happy we tried this place and will definitely be back when in the area!"}
