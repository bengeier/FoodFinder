{"text":"Awesome pizza. The only critique is the man serving comes across as condescending and irritated if asked about some of the ingredients. A little off-putting, particularly in front of my kids. All I asked is whether the prosciutto is added after the oven or before and got a rude response that implied I insulted them by even asking that."}
{"text":"Really nice place with a laid back, vibrant atmosphere, which also makes it a great place to bring kids earlier in the evening.  Service is fast, attentive, and friendly.  I had the Puttanesca the first time i went and a pizza the second, and both were delicious.  I plan to sample the beers when I go back as a non-pregnant,  my husband seemed to enjoy them!   BADLY need more places of this calibre in the Dufferin/St. Clair area."}
{"text":"Came here as a group of nine in January 2015.  They took our reservation.  A lovely evening, everyone loved the food.  Great appetizers, fantastic pizza.  Really nice service.

Reasonable cost.  We all enjoyed ourselves.  I had the Tiramisu, and I rate that a 4/10, but everything else was great."}
{"text":"First time here after reading the reviews on yelp. Definitely wanted to give it a try.

In a nutshell. it was ok but they're certainly willing to somehow make it better. Staff was super friendly, but in their eagerness they sometimes forgot to bring us our drinks promptly or food took a bit too long to come out. However, their charm more than made up for it.

The appetizers were great for the price, especially their selection of cheeses and fried calamari with other seafood.

Unfortunately the entrees weren't that good. Most people at my table, including me, had the special of the day (a pasta with a cherry tomato sauce) and, although the pasta is fresh and home made, it was not cooked properly. Also, the A/C was probably not working properly, so it started getting a bit steamy inside.

They made up for it by comping a couple of drinks, even though we made no complaints, and off we were. 

I'll give it 3.5 stars and will try again. Keep it up guys, you're almost there!"}
{"text":"In a word, fantastic! This place hits all the high notes. The service is personal, friendly, and efficient (John is the best). The pizza? The pizza is the best in Toronto. A good amount of chew on the bottom and a light char on the crust that is just sublime. The toppings are balanced and generous. Simply  the best."}
{"text":"I arrived sceptical on a Saturday night as I didn't have a reservation and I've been hearing a lot about this place so I thought it would be impossible to get into.  I was really surprised because we walked right in.  thought it would be packed - it SHOULD have been packed - it was great!

The pizza is really good - I had the Diavola and for those that don't like too much spice it would be manageable.  I might have made it a bit spicier but it was flavourful.  My friend had the type that had four different toppings.  She really liked it.  I thought the crust was really good - it was thin, but not too thin - it had some oomph!

The room was quite comfortable and our server was great.  Highly recommend it!"}
{"text":"I'm giving them one star because they produce pizza that is among the best in the city and another star because they've proven that Corsa Italia can support a dinning scene that is kicked up a notch.  
The prices are a little high for what they offer and the service could be given some pointers and from what I've seen and read on other sites from past employees, the proprietors and management can use an attitude adjustment.  A server belittled the busboy in front of us once when the busboy brought to me a glass of wine that was only half full.  Another time our white wine was room temperature.  We brought it up with our server who reminded me of Yosemite Sam and wouldn't have looked out of place at a Tea Party rally informed me that white wine is served at a higher temperature than beer.  Yes, thank you tips, now can you please replace my 22 degree wine.  While he did correct the situation in the end, we received the cold shoulder the rest of the evening.  When it came time to paying our bill there was a drink missing from it, we informed him and while we didn't expect him to kiss our feet, didn't receive much more than a, \"uh, ya, thanks.\" then printed us a new bill.  
There are many new pizzerias that have opened up with great service and while I appreciate their contribution in terms of atmosphere and food, snooty \"QSA\" isn't what St. Clair West needs."}
{"text":"Went on a date, very nice atmosphere and friendly service (with real italians and italian music!)
The pizzas were great and tasty. The crust is not crispy but like good hot bread. This is a style (you like it or you don't).
Real spicy oil was appreciated. 
The coffee was good.
Overall a nice evening! Would come back"}
{"text":"After reading Susan B.'s review, and having experienced the same as she, I decided to add my review of Pizza e Pazzi. Ended up coming to this place early January 2014 as it was recommended by a friend of mine, whose best friend works in the kitchen there.

First off, its in a pretty dismal sketchy part of Etobicoke. The restaurant itself is quite small, and my dinner companion and I both agreed that the dark wall colors and decor of the restaurant suited more of a nightclub feel rather than homey fine dining Italian.

We were seated right away and given our menus. We were also given complimentary foccaccia and a small tray of various spreads and toppings for the foccaccia. Was very good and things seemed to be starting off nicely. Then things went downhill from there.

The waiter came over to take our order.We decided to order 2 pizza's to share. One was a white pizza with arrugula, the other was a spicy sauce pizza with sopprasatta salalmi. I knew something was not right when not even 5 minutes later the spicy pizza shows up. Its a super thin crust, a little to thin IMO. The outside crust was crispy and cooked well, but the inside of the pizza was a soggy uncooked mess! You could not pick it up, if you wanted to. The arrugula pizza was just plain weird. Just picture a white pizza crust and dumping a large bowl of raw arrugula on top.WTF?? I've had my share of good authentic wood oven pizzas before. This was not one of those times. I have a feeling that inexperience was the problem here.

Being a passive person by nature, I just ate what I could and got the hell out of there."}
{"text":"As good as it gets for neapolitan pizza, and maybe, Toronto's best. 
The other items we gave here, calamari, and a spectacular buffalatta and parma appetizer have also been terrific. Homemade foccacia with three toppings provide a nice start to the meal. 
All this in a very fine looking restaurant, with lots of character.
Preventing a five star review is the service. We've been twice and the first time, service was fine, the second time it came with attitude and a \"i'll do it my way\" kind of thing\", bordering on rudeness. After we clearly made it aware that we wouldn't take this kind if thing with our attitude, it improved, but still not great. Sorry Pizza e pazzi...but you need to improve the attitude with some of your people. You're food and restaurant are amazing, this doesn't need to ruin it."}
{"text":"This restaurant serves fairly authentic Italian food.

The offerings are comparable to Terroni for those of you who have been there. We tried the calamari. different types of Neapolitan pizza, as well as a pasta dish. All of them were well-executed. This is probably as good as it gets for the price that you will pay for these dishes.

One of the nice things is that they also have risotto on the menu (although I have not tried it).

The restaurant is a bit small so I am not sure what the noise level is like during the busy hours (we were there late when it was not so busy).

Definitely worth a visit if you live in the neighborhood or happen to be passing by."}
{"text":"The pizza is good, a little limited in variety, but that is the traditional thing, I guess. Does not feel very welcoming or comfortable to sit in but we often enjoy the take out."}
{"text":"Went to the one on St Clair and Dufferin location , everything was good the only thing bad service server doesn't even listen when you order he come to your table ask everything ok and before you say something he leaves.  Not a great service ! To bad because food is good"}
{"text":"Can't go wrong, great service, some of the best pizza in town, go for the ZENATO RIPASSA VALPOLICELLA SUPERIORE, best wine on the list."}
{"text":"Decent, but we have much better options in the Corso Italia area.

Bread is okay.
Pasta is pretty good and the lunch specials are good value for money
Pizza very average, and doesn't compare to Marcello's

Recommend Marcello's or Ferro's instead."}
{"text":"Tried this place on a whim while in the area as my kids really wanted pizza.  We were seated quickly and ordered a Margherita pizza right away for the kids.  The pizza was fresh and cooked well and arrived quickly.  My husband also ordered pizza and I ordered the fettuccine with bolognese sauce. The pasta was cooked to perfection and tasted homemade.  The sauce was average out of any Italian restaurant in the area.  Nothing to write home about but nothing really spectacular either.  My only complaint was the serving size of the pasta.  It was the size of an appetizer serving.  For the cost (about $17),  I expected a larger portion.  The waiter also brought fresh bread and a few different dips.  This was a nice touch.  Unfortunately,  after the food being served,  we never saw him again except to bring the bill.  Our water was not re-filled even once in the duration of the meal. The place was almost dead too,  with only one other table of customers.  Overall,  good pizza but staff could be more attentive and pasta portions could be more generous.  I won't say that I'll never go back but I wouldn't go out of my way to visit again."}
{"text":"Yummy!! I Was in Naples last summer and had the privilege to dine at pizzeria da Michele (google it!). Tonight's margherita pizza at pizza e pazzi brought back memories of last summer in Naples. If you can appreciate a true Napoli style pizza; come here! Only thing they could improve on is the surface of the tables... As they are strangely sticky. Otherwise fabulous!"}
{"text":"what kind of place doesn't have their phone number anywhere on the internet months after being open???? Walked in for dinner in early January and wasn't overly impressed. Maybe they were still learning how to use the wood burning oven? Ordered margharita for my child and quattro stagionni for myself; I know it's supposed to be thin crust, but the pizza crust was SO thin that it was burnt yet soggy at the same time.Plus, the Hostess wore so much perfume that i couldn't even smell the pizzas, and the place was so cold that we had to wear our coats while eating! But the pastas look tasty and I promised my child we'd go back to try their dessert pizzas.... now i can't find a phone number anywhere to make a reservation!!!  come on guys, i'm dying for a great pizza place in the 'hood but so far you aren't it."}
{"text":"Really good Napoleon pizza mid-town watch out libretto!!

Service was amazing, waiter offered an appy off the menu to try seeing it was our first time there.  Prices are reasonable, and really good atmosphere.  Will def come again"}
{"text":"Great atmosphere in mid town serving authentic Napoleon style pizza.  Service was authentic and great.  Would definitely frequent here more often to try the other specialties which judging by tables next to me and my husband looked amazing."}
{"text":"Nice place. Good atmosphere. Pizza is really good!!!! Strongly recommend it.

The lasagna was just ok. Little bland.

Would go back for the pizza for sure."}
{"text":"This location of Pizza e Pazzi is one that I enjoy. The staff are generally friendly, and it's always great when we get one particular server who is very very Italian and super friendly. The others are sort of hit and miss in terms of attentiveness and friendliness. The food is tasty, if not a bit hit and miss as well. For example, my husband often orders the ear-shaped orechiette pasta dish. The first time it was amazing, the second time not so great, the third time pretty good, then not amazing and so on. He keeps ordering it though, for whatever reasons.

The other location which is further west is one that I am not a fan of. That is almost partly why I feel I had to take stars off. I noticed another reviewer mentioned that they were given a lot of sass because of their wine choice. I too received that treatment at the further west location, where I ordered a glass of wine and was told that I only wanted \"that kind\" because the \"media told me it was good\". Pompous much? That location seems to run on that high-and-mighty atmosphere, but I haven't found that as much with the Wychwood one."}
{"text":"I just moved into this neighborhood, and I've already been here twice. This is the best pizza I've had since visiting Italy.The staff is SO friendly and informative, and the food is fairly priced. The wines are fantastic but aren't cheap. They take pride in using the best ingredients, and really know their Italian culture (and don't shy away from telling you all about it). This would be a great date spot. It screams authenticity. I can tell this will be my go-to Italian joint from now on."}
{"text":"This place was overwhelmed by a busy crowd on a Friday night.  Our one year old was upset by the wait and they offered little in the way of apology.  The pasta we ordered was not much better than what you coukd throw together yourself.  Bad experience I think the place has gone downhill."}
{"text":"Although this place is very fancy and always has great specials, I was disappointed when I went there. I ordered lasagne and when I bit into a piece it was delicious. However, as I continued to eat I realized the middle was cold. It was as if it was frozen and they placed it in the oven to warm up but they didn't leave it long enough. Not a great experience and it's been hard to convince anyone to return with me to give it a second chance. I would return again becomes the place is always packed and everyone seems to love it. I think if the environment is positive it's worth at least a second chance"}
{"text":"We aren't seated long before we're offered beer, wine, and complimentary olives, mushroom tapenade and fresh red fife and pita. I'm surprised in the best way- so few places I've been to offer something for the table to snack on while orders are prepping and drinks are being poured, let alone something as delightful as this. The mushroom tapenade is marinaded and moist, not soggy. It's briny, it's juice doing well to moisten the spongy white bread and pita. The olives are firm, green, and drizzled with olive oil. I love the bread which is incredibly fresh, and polish off half the basket to myself, dipping the bread chunks  generously in olive oil.


Mains are ordered, as is a pizza to share. Despite my conviction that I would get a pizza to myself, the pasta selection is incredibly tantalizing, and all three of us opt for different kinds of semolina entrees.

To keep things simple in the anticipation of heavy mains, and out of consideration for the vegetarianism of one guest, the simplest pizza is ordered- a classic Margherita ($13). In the traditional style, this pizza is only tomato sauce and mozzarella. Such simplicity requires the very best ingredients, which are readily supplied. The pizza arrives steaming, blisters on the soft and dusty crust. It's great. My first Neapolitan pizza! The dough is really the most important thing here, I realize, cutting through it with a knife and a bit of difficulty. Incredibly naan-like in thickness and doughiness, I felt like this recipe could have been passed down from nonna to nonna for centuries (it probably has been). Sensitivity and though has gone into selecting the fixings of the pizza. The buffalo mozzarella is melted and sultry, just adding enough sharp kick to work with the pool of fresh tomato sauce held in the thick dike of crust. It doesn't taste like PIZZA SAUCE, just like gorgeous vine ripe tomatoes, fresh and pureed with nothing to complicate them.

In a move mimicking her hair style, Amanda ordered manicotti. I don't think it was a deliberate choice, but the two big round rolls did look a bit like the big curl on one side of her head. In retrospect, I can see how drawing dinner like this might make Pizza e Pazzi a little less appealing to future patrons...we found no hair in our food! Not even our own. So forgive my drawings, sometimes I forget that putting one and one together occasionally equals eww.
Understated and simple, the manicotti was pleasant and satisfying without doing anything unpredictable, or being bold enough to really shock the taste buds. Soft spinach and ricotta stuffed pasta was ladled with that same fresh, sunny tomato sauce. It tastes sweet since there isn't too much salt, and everything is brought together simply with little added frills. The thick pasta makes it a pleasantly heavy dish, and it's alright that there's no side of salad to go along with it. The fresh basil leaf added a nice kick, and there was a taste of mushroom throughout.
Let's swing over to another extreme- the amazing experience Laura ordered. If the manicotti was a bit plain, Pizza e Pazzi went out of their way to make this spaghetti alla puttenesca ($14) incredibly bold. They combined the saltiest, briniest ingredients- puckered black olives shrunken with ripeness, juice laden capers (I've never been a fan), and stringy bits of tuna and zippy anchovy. The tomato sauce was lumpy with fish, just like mariners take on a bolognaise. It was INCREDIBLY fishy! I wonder if they needed two kinds of fish? Everything was salty but the tomato sauce was still fresh, so in the end it wasn't an overpowering experience- just bold and flavourful. And huge! What a generous portion of spaghetti!
 I also ordered a pasta dish to myself, choosing the appealing sounding ear-shaped pasta, oreciette alle cime di rape ($14). When it arrived, I kept thinking of ninja turtles- it reminds me a lot of more of turtle shell than of ears! Dude. This was another dish with anchovy, a fish I'm happy to see get so much love on a menu (it's one of those oft-sustainable fishies). Like the manicotti before it, the orechiette may have suffered from a lack of boldness! It was buttery with olive oil, and bitter from the rapini, two flavours which did make for a fun back and forth over my palate. I wish there had been more to it than those crisp first notes. Even the spice from the anchovies and a few chili flakes left quickly. Perhaps it isn't bad to have a light and fresh pasta in the summer, but I should know that when I order pasta, I want something that leaves me feeling heavy. I enjoyed the smoky finish with my beer, and it was over all too quickly. Next time, I'll order something with cheese!"}
{"text":"Miles ahead of Terroni, and a serious competitor to Pizzeria Libretto, Pizza e Pazzi makes hands down the best pizza crust in the city.

Choose either the classic Margherita, the Napolitana (anchovies and olives) or the Diavola (spicy salami) to experience the delicacy of the crust, the freshness of the tomato smear, and the creaminess of the excellent fior di latte.

I actually prefer P e P's crust over Libretto's since it's cooked in the centre, whereas Libretto's is wet and too gooey for my taste.

Homemade foccaccia and crusty bread are made from the same divine dough.

This is heaven for bread lovers everywhere."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere and authentic Italian food. Try the eggplant parmiganio. Just opened up 2 months ago and seems like a great neighbourhood spot. Parking is free after 6pm on lakeshore unlike downtown streets."}
{"text":"Nice little spot, the service was slow but they apologized and were very nice about the delays we experienced. The fried risotto balls are excellent to start, I ordered the Pizza do Parma which was average, but certainly not horrible or anything just a little disappointing. The menu was difficult to navigate and could use a refresh otherwise a decent overall meal that was reasonably priced."}
{"text":"I'm surprised that people seem to have had bad experiences here. Though I hated the location near Dufferin because of the dim waitress who was too busy slicing lemons for 10 minutes to greet us at all and annoyed us for the entire meal, the location at Christie has always been extremely good to us. Pizza is delicious and pappardelle bosaiola is wonderful. I loooove their tronchetto as well! It's always a struggle choosing between my pappardelle and tronchetto. Not a big fan of their tiramisu, but their nutella pizza is sinfully good. The staff was always nice to us, and once (out of 10 visits) we were disappointed with the food, but the waiter and the manager took very good care of us and made up for their mistake which can totally happen to anyone."}
{"text":"First time here. Best italian food on the corso strip. Service was great and price point affordable. Great gem of a find"}
{"text":"Food was mediocre at best.  The waiter had very few tables to look after and yet it took him a long time to bring us water, appetizers, main course, dessert, the bill, and change lol.  So we ended up tipping the waiter mediocre at best :D would  definitely not come back... oh and the restaurant was incredibly cold inside because they lack an interior door, so everytime the door opens there's a cold breeze which fills the restaurant.   The table beside us was also complaining about how cold it was in the restaurant to the waiter so he turned the heat on higher for about 5mins and then turned it down again!"}
{"text":"Pass on this place.
Went there thanks to a wagjag deal, waste of time.  Obnoxious waiter needed me to explain that since I have a reservation, I would like to sit at a table.  
we ordered a caprese salad and insalada mista to start.   Caprese was bland and way too overpriced (16 dollars?), the mista was just meh
We followed that with the fettucine bolognese.  The bolognese was nice but it was ruined by far to undercooked pasta.  We decided to skip dessert since so far everything unimpressed us.  Thankfully with the wagjag deal, we only had to pay $15, which to be honest is pretty much the value of the meal.
I have heard much better things about the 512 St Clair location, will not be returning to this one."}
{"text":"Space is tiny. My group and I had to wait 1 hour to get seated and another hour before we got our food. The pizza is thick, doughy and pricey and a friend's pizza was half cooked! And what's up with all the 1/2, 3/4 marks? Taking my business elsewhere next time."}
{"text":"This place is amazing. Incredible food and very reasonably priced. One of my favourite restaurants in the city!"}
{"text":"I love the chewy, VPN pizza and generally have enjoyed myself there - except last time we went as we were paying the table next to us fished a cockroach out of their drink!!!!  BARF. Without that experience I would've given the Corso Italia location a solid 3 stars and 4 for the Christie location (better space/ambiance) but a roach in a drink is inexcusable!"}
{"text":"Lick the plate good (yes I am a classy guy)."}
{"text":"We enjoyed the pizza here.  Neapolitan style is our favorite kind of pizza, but if you don't like it you won't like this place.  The \"burnt\" comment from another reviewer relates more to style than actual failed execution I think.

Our service was fine.  We didn't experience any of the issues identified by other reviewers.  It does have a \"we're trendy\" vibe, though, so I wouldn't be surprised if they get snooty with some people."}
{"text":"Vera Pizza Neapolitana - That's the real deal. This place is really good and I definitely want to go back sometime soon. Prices is not that bad, and their food.... yummy! I liked the complimentary focaccia bread and some of those spread thingies, they were good. My sister and I ordered the Polpette dela nonna, and the pizza diavola, everything was slicked with oil and yeah, I was practically in heaven while I was stuffing everything in my mouth. You must try their chilli oil whatever that is, it just made everything taste better. Server guy made a mistake with my sister's drink order but was cool enough to replace it with the right thing, which makes this place amazing, plus their cute. lol. I like their accent! It just makes the place more authentic. CAN'T WAIT TO GO BACK."}
{"text":"It appears to have closed the last time we walked by. Good riddance! Hopefully a better restaurant replaces it."}
{"text":"Decided to go for dinner because of the positive Toronto Life review. Boy did they get it wrong. I had the antipasto and Pizza 'nduja. My companion had the seafood scialatielli. We waited for almost 20 minutes for the antipasto to arrive which is unacceptable for a dish that needs no cooking. It finally came, and was just a pile of meat and cheese, with no accompanying olives or marinated vegetable to cut the oiliness of the meats. Then, before we finished the antipasto, the server brought my companions scialatielli. Two of the clams were closed, and when my companion asked for more mussels instead, the server merely said it was supposed to be that way, and brought it to the kitchen to pry them open. The pasta was also undercooked (not just al dente) and the server said that's how they do it. He didn't offer any consolations. Then my pizza arrived. It was mostly a mound of doughy crust, too-acidic sauce, and gloupy cheese. There was hardly any 'nduja (which the sever even pronounced wrong) and it was soggy. The only redeeming factor was a different server who offered us desert and coffee on him, which we politely declined. Toronto Life stated that the pizza was on par with Libretto or Queen Margherita, but it was even close. The menu was typical Italian fare, nothing special. Too bad, it would have been nice to have a place like Libretto or QM so close to my home."}
{"text":"we went to this new pizza e pazzi location today. 

As they just opened, it's still chaotic - no high chairs, quite a few items on the menu were unavailable, there were no hand towels in the washroom,  no one greeted us as we entered and hovered by the entrance, unsure whether to seat ourselves or now, the tables were a bit shaky - but the food was delicious!!! And the service improved after that initial lack of greeting and welcoming.

They have a real oven right in there, so their bread and pizza are amazingly fresh and delicious. Pasta was good, too - so were coffee and tiramisu. They are not cheap at all, their pastas and pizzas are $15-25, so I'd say they're not an everyday kind of place, but nice. And they were packed, by the time we left (at 7 pm) there was only one free table left (although it's a Saturday before xmas)."}
{"text":"One of very few places in the city to sells authentic Neapolitan pizza. What is Neapolitan pizza you ask? Well there are a few rules (http://www.pizzanapoletana.org/images/file/disciplinare%202008%20UK.pdf). Basically it comes down to very specific authentic ingredients and a cooking time of 60-90 seconds in an oven 905°. (WHOA!)

Anyway, this pizza is superb. A million times better than the stuff you get for takeout and to top it all off the restaurant itself it trendy and comfortable, the service is friendly and quick and the prices are pretty reasonable. 

Check it out. You won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"As a seasoned traveler and someone who regularly goes to Naples, I must say that this restaurant keeps to traditional Nepalese style pizza. The ingredients are fresh, the crust is made to perfection and the overall blend is unbelievable. Although the price was a bit higher than expected, the feel and vibe of the restaurant made up for it."}
{"text":"Really enjoying the pizza, way better than Libretto or Terroni. The fresh burrata is to die as a shared antipasto."}
{"text":"On a quest to discover the best pizza around, a small group of pizza fans met here on Wednesday evening to give the pizza a try. Located almost right at the corner of Dufferin and St Clair Ave W it's a super nice location with a focus put on their massive pizza oven.

I enjoyed the focaccia/bread with olive paste, mushrooms and what I believe was artichokes to start. One of the group ordered their calamari to start and it was served well, not overcooked and battered perfectly for my taste. It was served with only lemon so I can appreciate the authenticity of the dish, but I guess i was looking for something to dip it in (old habits I suppose). Still good with salt and lemon juice!

I went with the funghi e Salsicce (mushroom and sausage) pizza, which was $19.75 for one personal sized Neapolitan style pizza. I have to give them full marks on this pizza. Dough, sauce, toppings, all of exceptionally high quality and perfectly cooked (if my mouth is watering right now as I recall my experience, it's a testament to how much I enjoyed it).

I should note that I expected a top shelf pizza as they are one of (if not THE ONLY) spots in Toronto that is Neapolitan Pizza certified locations. to find out how one becomes certified authentic (meaning it tastes EXACTLY how a pizza in Naples would) see the qualifications found here - http://americas.pizzanapoletana.org/getcertifed.php

The only gaff and the only reason for a less than perfect review was the service. I found our server to not be too interested in our group, awkward, not exactly engaging and when he left the bill he then disappeared for 20 minutes. I'm not sure where to because this spot isn't that big, but he was GONE. We had to flag another server to find him so we could pay and leave. Maybe an off night?

I'll be back - this pizza is the real deal!

Eatcrest Out"}
{"text":"Our experience at Pizza E Pazzi was terrible. 

To start, it was not busy in the restaurant when our group of 4 arrived (maybe 2 other small groups). Once we were seated, it took the waiter a little while to bring us water and another couple of minutes for him to come around to take our orders. 

When we received our food, 2 out of the 4 orders were completely wrong. One of the orders was gnocchi with shrimp and the other was a calzone. Both of us ended up receiving a gnocchi dish with just a plain tomato sauce with cheese. We did not say anything and waited to see if the waiter realized his mistake. He said nothing. 

The food itself was blah. The other two orders were a gnocchi dish and lasagna. The lasagna tasted like it came from a Michelina's frozen dinner. None of the dishes were spectacular. It filled us, but there was nothing about it that was satisfactory. 

The service did not get any better throughout the dinner. He never checked up on our table. The restaurant still was not that busy and he seemed unable to juggle the few tables he had. After almost a 2 hour meal (which was not intended), we asked for the bill and noticed he did key in the correct orders we made but did not notice anything when he brought out our food. We told him about his mistake and he huffed and puffed, but was not very apologetic. He did end up taking off one of the dishes from the bill but did not say much after that. Everything from the food to the service was not worth the time or money. If you are on St. Clair Ave. West and looking for a place to eat, do yourself a favour and skip this restaurant."}
{"text":"Went with a Buytopia voucher with my wife.

Bread: Was ok.

Salad: Nice large portion, I shared with my wife.

Mussels: The mussels themselves were small, likely because they're not in season.  Sauce was good, just needed more of it infused into the mussels.

Pizza: Not as good as Libretto or Margherita.

Orrechiette: Overly rich, like a bar of butter was in the cream sauce.

Service: Good, solid.

With the abundance of choice in this city for Italian, I don't think I'd go back."}
{"text":"Very good pizza!  Reminds me of pizza in Italy.  Pastas are ...good.  I would come back for the pizzas."}
{"text":"Maybe my expectations were too high, given it's comparison to spots like Pizza LIbretto, but I was disappointed.  And Libretto this ain't.

The atmosphere at Pizza e Pazzi was bustling and full of good energy.  The owners (or managers?) actively on the floor and the servers hustling continually.  Lots of engagement.  We had to wait about 15-20 minutes for our reserved table because the party before us took their time, but it wasn't a big deal.

They started us off with some chewy walnut bread and nice condiments (caramelized onions, a vegetarian dip that I couldn't quite identify, sauteed mushrooms).  Service was attentive, although the server seemed very disappointed that we weren't ordering lots of alcohol.

We all ordered salad and mains.  The salads were decent.  My mixed greens were literally just that with some very sweet cherry tomatoes.  A little watery, maybe.  My husband ordered a special salad of bufalo mozzarella and shaved truffles which should have been spectacular (especially for the $25 price tag) but was instead just average.  The cheese was maybe a little too salty and water-logged.  Not as nice as some high quality mozzas I've had in the past.

Pizzas were very good - just not outstanding.  My tre funghi was yummy, but was under-seasoned to my taste.  The margarita was much better (probably because they use the salty mozzarella that we tasted raw on the salad earlier) so it had more flavour.

Overall, it was very good pizza, if a bit doughy for this style.  I agree with a recent reviewer - in this area I'd pick Marcellos over this place.  It's more homey and less elegant but the flavours are just so much richer and they are much more generous.  Pizza e Pazzi should focus more on their flavours and not try so hard in the \"We're new and chic\" category.  Why would we spend $75 for a dinner for two (sans alcohol) when we could spend so much less and get better food elsewhere?

Vegetarian Score: 6.5/10.  Not as much choices as in other italian spots for veggies, but you won't walk away hungry."}
{"text":"My friend and I have had this pizzeria on our dining lost for months and we can finally check it off our list. These were my findings:
-comfortable yet classy atmosphere
-very friendly and attentive service
-menu: surprisingly none of the pizza combinations sounded especially appetizing although I'm sure they're all delicious. She went with the roasted veg and I chose the margarita.
I must say, I have had better thin crust, authentic Italian pizza in the city. The centre to crust ratio was off. (Lots of crust and not enough dough in the centre so it was soft and floppy in the middle.) As well, there were only two small basil leaves on my entire pizza. I guess basil leaves are hard to come by these days. My friend have her pizza the stamp of approval.
-HUGE disappointment: I asked for extra sauce for my crust, NOT because there wasn't enough on the pizza for the average person but because since I was old enough to eat sauce I have loved it and like to douse everything, especially a pizza crust in it. However, when I requested a little bit extra I was refused. I even explained that it was prepared fine I just personally like extra on the side and they wouldn't budge. I do respect the chefs, their vision, and that they wish to execute their work in a specific way but it also must be understood that they are serving patrons and if we leave dissatisfied or worse, unhappy, it's their reputation on the line. 
Overall I can't say I would return but please decide for yourself. My intention is not to bad mouth them, only to forewarn you to not expect any type of menu exceptions or special requests. 
Happy eating!"}
{"text":"I rarely go out for Italian food, but we were looking for something comforting and tasty. This place was great for that. Authentic Neapolitan pizza, nice unique ingredients and great service. The waiter knew everything about his menu, and made excellent recommendations. We sat by the window/garage door. The decor is pleasant. It was busy, yet not too loud to my taste. I will definitely go back."}
{"text":"Pizza e Pazzi is essentially Libretto without the long wait or the Ossington crowd.  This is VPN certified pizza to the bone. Arguably, it has even a better crust than that of Libretto as it is more chewy, or doughy. I usually get the pizza margherita, which always hits the spot and keeps me coming back. The appetizers are really good as well.  I would suggest trying out the calamari, which come without sauce, and the suppli fritti. I tried the tiramisu once, but I found there was way too much cocoa powder on top. 

Overall, great atmosphere, good service. The restuarant itself is not too big, but it does tend to get a little bit hot, especially at the back and near the woodburning oven. I would suggest getting a seat at the front in front of the bar."}
{"text":"I love every bite of my pizza. It's a little germ on St Clair W and Dufferin. Very classy decor with stove oven at the back. Pleasant service."}
{"text":"Decent, but nothing special.

The Hubster and I came for a nice dinner on Saturday. I was craving pasta, and he wanted pizza. He was put off by the choices, being a real carnivore. He opted for the pasta carbonara and I had the fettucine bolognese. I started off with the soup of the day: mushroom leek, which was GIGANTIC and very very tasty. The pastas were fine. Nothing mind-blowing, but not terrible. The noodles were cooked just right, which was great.

I think the owner was our server. He seemed pretty disinterested and never told us the specials, which I heard from another server for the table next to us. A shame, since one of the items was something I really really would have liked to order (ravioli).

We probably won't be back to this spot, despite the fact that it's just a few blocks down the street from us. Sidenote, the pastas were huge and we took the rest home. Later on that night, we reheated them and they were FANTASTIC. Not sure why they were better the second time around."}
{"text":"Truly authentic Neapolitan pizza! We had a great meal in this little Italian restaurant. 

Ambiance:
The restaurant is small and family style. There are couple of tables where they put together for a large party. Atmosphere was very casual for get-together and chat over dinner. 

Service:
Service was attentive. Our wait staff was very detailed when we asked her about the menu. They were keen on serving authentic Italian food so you can't find chicken in their pasta. They also recommended the sister restaurant, Rione IX, which serves Roman style pizza at the end of our meal and showed us the menu. 

Food:
Don't go elsewhere if you are looking for authentic Neapolitan pizza! 

They started us with good foccacia bread with a nice olive spread that I really like.

We ordered calamari, burrata, and tortino as our appetizers. Calamari was huge, good for 6 people, crispy and nicely battered. The tortino was nicely flavoured with tomato sauce and the fior di latte was very fresh. Burrata was not too bad, the pesto and tomatoes added a nice flavour to it. I like burrata cheese that is a bit more runnier. 

For mains, my pappardelle with tiger shrimps and porcini mushrooms was cooked just right!!! Perfectly al dante. The sauce was sweet but a bit too rich. Too bad the tiger shrimps were still a bit mushy and wasn't as crisp as I like. 

The baked gnoochi was served super hot from the oven. Say yes to cheese! 

I sampled a small slice of nduja pizza and it was perfecto! Nice thin crust, perfect chewiness and crispness, and slightly charred from the wood-fired oven. The sauce was fragrantful and the fior di latte was very fresh. Nduja sausage was spicy and salty. 

It was a great meal! In terms of Neapolitan pizza, this place is right up there with Pizzeria Libretto and Ovest,  and even better than Queen Mergherita Pizza! Next on the agenda is to visit the sister restaurant for Roman pizza!"}
{"text":"Really, really good authentic Italian style pizza, great service. Tastes JUST like the pizza in Napoli. A completely different level from Pizza Pizza and Domino's, definite must-try if you're a pizza lover!"}
{"text":"Very very good/authentic Italian food. Felt nice to feel like back in Italy for a while. Love this place!"}
{"text":"I've been going to this restaurant off and on since it opened.  Their menu has changed a bit from time to time but they stay pretty consistent.  

As far as pizza goes this place makes what they call certified Neapolitan pizza.  That is they use the methods and ingredients that are used in the official pizza from Napoli.  That being said I've had many of their different pizzas both ordered, sampled, shared with others etc.  I've had maybe half of each the pizza with sauce (rosso=red) or without (blanco) and they really make it as you would expect if you had something to compare it to.  

I've never been to Napoli so I can't compare it to the \"real thing\" but I can say that their food is very good regardless.  They make good food and they happen to be authentic.  I particularly enjoy the tuna salad as a starter which you can share because it's a big serving as well as the fried dough with nutella as a dessert.  

I was just there yesterday and the menu is less explanatory than it used to be because the descriptions are harder to understand for a layperson non-Italian like myself but for what it's worth their product is a very good product.  

The service every time I've ever been has been decent to great.  I can't say I've ever had a bad experience there as far as service goes but the food it special that's for sure."}
{"text":"My friend and I have been there three times. Except for one occasion, the dining experience has not been positive. The pizza is usually burnt; they seem unable to get the oven temperature right. They resent being shown the 'charcoaled' crust. The waiter with the bunch of janitorial keys dangling on his behind needs an adjustment in customer relations and class. Prices are moderate but neither the ambiance, nor the food justify price."}
{"text":"Definitely gives Pizza Libretto a run for its money. Pizza e Pazzi is a new addition to the tiny group of Toronto restaurants that serve authentic  Pizza Napolitana. And it's very good Pizza Napolitana too. The basic Margherita was perfect in its simplicity - perfectly blistered crust, perfectly melted mozzarella di buffala, fantastically flavourful tomatoes and basil. Bonus points to the server for upselling me on a great glass of Falanghina before my meal instead of the pinot grigio I was contemplating. The service was a bit slow and inattentive otherwise, though, and the environment a bit cluttered and uncomfortable. I will need to go back and delve deeper into their menu, but the pizza alone makes Pizza e Pazzi well worth a visit."}
{"text":"Food: The highest of quality ingredients. Generous portions. Skillful and artful chef takes standard Italian menu items and makes them extraordinary. The Neapolitan pizza (a high-temp fast bake style of pizza made famous in Naples) is the best Toronto has to offer. The Buffalo Mozeralla is amazing and generous...I had it as part of the Caprese salad which was so flavorful it needed no balsamic and came with a full dop (200 grams) of buffalo Mozeralla cheese. The mista salad was made with a balsamic reduction, and the eggplant parmigiano was fresh and outstanding. 

Decor: a small restaurant where the kitchen takes up more than half the square footage. Casual, laid back atmosphere, is nothing to rave about, but is decent and fits the fact that although the menu is huge, the place is really a pizza joint at heart. 

Service: Our waiter was excellent. So friendly, knowledgable, and very helpful. He seemed overworked and could have used more support from the seemingly large number of managers. 

Overall, I can't wait to go back again. I do wish they took reservations,  but their sister restaurant a few blocks west will take reservations."}
{"text":"This was on someones top 10 list for 2011 so I really wanted to try it.

Space: dark, intimate, yet inviting. (does that make sense).
Food: LOVED The bread. It's perfect. As for the pizza - it rocks too. It has those black bubbles on the crust, the perfect sauce as and just the right amount of cheese. It all worked. $16 and happy.
Service: wonderful friendly waiter. Cant complain."}
{"text":"I was excited to try this place as it offered a wood fired pizza oven which is new to the neighbourhood.  It was alight, nothing great, reasonable.  My better half had the clams pasta and was disappointed, tasted as though the clams came from a can she said.

We decided to give it another go and were astonished to see that it was closed?  It appears to have shut down and I have no idea why."}
{"text":"LOVE THIS PIZZA PLACE.

The pizza here is absolutely fantastic. Not heavy at all, and the dough is to die for. I ordered the one with prosciutto, arugula, and fresh fior de latte. Loved it! 
For dessert, I had the panda cotta with fresh berry jam. Absolutely perfect.

Prices were fair and service was excellent. I'll definitely be returning!"}
{"text":"The pizza here is perfect.  That's the best I can come up with here.  Perfection.  This is the difference in stopping at \"Neapolitan Style\" and actually being VPN certified.  Pizza e Pazzi is certified and it shows in every detail.  The sauce is essentially a spread of the best tomatoes you can imagine, like the real San Marzano tomatoes required for VPN certification. They are perfectly balanced between tangy and naturally sweet and burst with the flavor of vine ripening and sunshine.  The cheese is exactly what you expect from fresh mozzarella.  It's like melted, stretchy fresh cream.  A previous reviewer complained that there wasn't much basil.  No, but there was, however, just the right amount.  A leaf per slice and it was able to give each one that little nudge of basil goodness without overpowering.  Balance is everything in crafting pizza. As for the crust, the closest comparison I could think of is if you were to somehow be able to compose a pizza crust out of that soft, stretchy middle part of a baguette straight out of the oven and combine that with fresh naan. Yeah, it's that good.  The scattering of charred blisters from the wood oven add a nice complexity to the flavor.  
I was nearly tempted to order a second pizza, but instead got dessert and ordered some tiramisu.  The presentation was fantastic as it was served in a brandy snifter and scattered with a few berries and dabs of something.  I don't love fruit, so I didn't bother to see what it was.  The tiramisu was as well done as the pizza.  I could taste hints of fresh egg in the custardy part without it having an \"eggy\" taste if that makes any sense.  The dusting of cocoa blended nicely with the rest of the dessert and created a nice balance and extra layer of flavor.  
Some people focus a lot on service, so I will say that the waiter was perfectly friendly and prompt without being bothersome.  If you expect a stand up routine or a foot rub while he/she ignores other tables, then stop writing reviews of your server and focus on the food. 
Another reviewer complained about a server laughing at a request for gluten free pasta.  Good.  That's worth another five stars.  Should have left their gluten-free, miserable self at home."}
{"text":"Pizza so so. Torontonians dont really know their food."}
{"text":"They do make super pizza here! And a nice selection of wines as while.
Friendly staff, and good service. 

I discovered this place by accident because the line up at Marcello's, a local landmark, was longgggg!

Nice atmosphere, and the wood burning oven makes a nice pizza crust.

Look forward to going back soon!  

Oh yes, not just pizza, they have other great menu choices too."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere, authentic Italian dishes, friendly service, overall a positive experience. I would go back again."}
{"text":"I always hoped that one day, I could sit in the dining room of Gordon Ramsay's Hell's Kitchen watching all the drama that unfolded on his show... whether it was an act for good entertainment, I still thought it would be a memorable experience..... well folks, I experienced it at Pizza e Pazzi earlier this week!

My groupon was expiring so I decided to go on date night with me husband, something I was much looking forward to, especially with the praise I have heard about this restaurant.

I walked in on a Tuesday, the place seemed busy and the server came quickly to seat us. We requested to be farther away from the door, which he gladly accommodated. We were off to a good start. Shortly after, he comes back and tells us that the only thing they were serving at the moment... was PIZZA. I was a little confused as to what was happening but apparently, they were short staffed. I was excited for the pizza, yes but also wanted pasta and food of my choosing. They said that they could do \"some\" appetizers but they are busier than expected so cannot accommodate at this time. 

We came to consensus on what pizza we wanted because that was pretty much the only thing we could order, and the appetizers we were allowed to get - Eggplant Parmesan and Deep Fried Risotto Balls. We ordered a glass of Merlot, which we were told was OUT... and I wanted a glass of Red Bubbly........and....well... they didn't have that either. I'm starting to find this amusing.

The complimentary foccacia was tasty, which accompanied three spreads - brucschetta, olive, and pickled mushrooms. While we were munching away, we could hear the table behind us with the server apologizing for food going into the garbage and two pizzas coming right now. Not sure what was happening.

Our risotto balls came looking completely fried and refried. The shell was tough and way too crispy for my liking. The eggplant parmesan looked like it was sitting on the counter all day and drenched in cheese and stuck into the broiler for a quick melt. Lots of quick fixes that question the overall freshness of the food.

When the pizza came out - I found two measly pieces of basil in it, which I had expected more. Good thing the crust was nice and soft but by now, I'm just laughing at the bickering in the kitchen, about how \"people are sick\" and \"babysitting should not be required\" and \"you'll understand when you have kids\" - it was a total soap opera.

As we finished our dinner, I noticed that two large parties that had come in shortly after we started eating were getting their food............ and they had PASTA!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! I'm not even going to tell you the anger that flooded in my brain. Apparently, they had called for emergency help and a chef had showed up, allowing them to function fully in the kitchen. Why was I not advised of this? When I questioned the server, he told me that I could order pasta now and take it home with me? No thanks.

To end if off, our server said: \"While we don't give away vouchers, if you come back next time and I recognize your face, I can hook you up\"....  no offense.. but you didn't even ask for my name... you're never going to remember my face.

This night was full of apologies, disappointment and a perfect way to ruin a much anticipated date night.

Thanks for nothing."}
{"text":"I came to the Wychwood location of Pizza e Pazzi for dinner yesterday. We sat nearest the open window turned patio on the sidewalk. My friend had the spaghetti carbonara and I had the montanara (mushrooms, basil and mozzarella, extra virgin olive oil, prosciutto) pizza. I am going to frank: the pizza was very good and I ate it all. There, I confess! It was thin-crust which I love, the crust itself was soft yet crunchy bits. It was a cheese base pizza and I enjoyed it a lot. My friend also liked her dish.

The server was very helpful and was able to recommend an exquisite white wine to go along with my pizza.  When we left, a person responsible for this establishment (owner? manager?) greeted us, shaking our hands and thanking us for our patronage. I exaggerate; he shook our hands and thanked us in Italian. The menu is also in Italian with the dish descriptions in English. I am of 2 minds regarding this. I understand they want to exude an air of authenticity, I am just skeptical of the genuineness of the gesture."}
{"text":"By far the best Pizza in Toronto. I still haven't had a chance to try Marcello's which I hear is good too but I would say that Pizza e Pazzi is better than Pizza Libretto which is a close second and Terroni which I didn't like at all. I believe its the only other pizzeria other than Pizza Libretto that is certified by the AVPN which has a few nutty rules including regulations on the oven which has to be  flown down from italy, a certified pizzaiolo trained by the AVPN, a certain procedure for making the dough etc All the effortts paid off and I would say that this is some of the best pizza I have had in my life. I ordered a margherita which was full of flavour, had a nice thin non greasy crust and tasted excellent. The place was fairly empty when I visited and we got a fresh pizza 5 minutes after ordering. I just had to get dessert after enjoying the pizza so much and ordered a tiramisu which was served in a glass and was excellent as well. Since this is a new property everything looks really nice and new. I thought that some of the tables were a bit too close to each other but I guess they have to work with the space they have. While this wasn't a problem when I went there and there was barely anyone there, I can see it being a problem when the restaurant is packed and you're eating your meal a few centimeters away from a stranger. I'm probably just nitpicking and can confidently say that this is one of the best meals I have had in Toronto."}
{"text":"Very pleased with the service and food at this place. The appetizer was really interesting and tasted amazing. It had a mozzarella cheese ball wrapped around more creamy cheese inside, on a plate of salad with proscuito and parmesan cheese. Whoever came up with this combination is brilliant! The cabonara pasta was really nice as well as the pizza. The appetizer and the bread at the beginning was what really stood out though"}
{"text":"I generally don't like pizzerias but this one is special. Try the Diavola pizza. You will never go wrong with that!"}
{"text":"This place is as authentic as it gets for Italian Pizza in Toronto. To be honest I would avoid pizzerias here until I discovered Pizza e pazzi. 

I have been to the Wychwood location numerous times and I have never been disappointed. Recently I visited their Corso Italia place with a group of pizza lovers. I had high expectations and let's say they delivered on every bit except the service. 

The food was fantastic. I ordered the Diavola as usual. This pizza never fails me. Love the spicy salami and basil with a drizzle of spicy olive oil on top! We also had the crispy calamari appetizer to share. While not the best, it was well cooked and seasoned. 

All of us were very satisfied at the end of our meal. Then Lambert ordered the nutella dessert to share. It was amazing. Fried dough drizzled with generous amounts of nutella and powdered sugar. Every bite was heavenly. I was really full but I couldn't stop eating it. All in all a great experience. I wouldn't hesitate to come back with a group again!"}
{"text":"Che pizza! Era autentica qualità italiana del sud. Sono rimasto impressionato con il loro servizio e ospitalità. Ho apprezzato ogni ultimo morso. Come diciamo in Italia. Tutta Posto !!"}
{"text":"My favourite restaurant in the whole city. The charcuterie / antipasto board is amazing. Ingredients are so fresh. The margherita pizza is a must try. The primavera white pizza is also incredible. Thy the caprese salad for an EXPERIENCE. Service has always been great. Been coming here for years."}
{"text":"We went their after around 9pm. They had a teenager's birthday party that night. So was a bit noisy that night. Overall the ambience was good and we got the street parking right outside the restaurant.
Service was good. Waitress was nice and respectful. 
We ordered calamari and and Di parma. Calamari was god but some of the pieces were overcooked and rubbery. Di Parma was alright. The dough was nice and fresh and the toppings were flavorful as well. The the pizza got very soggy from the middle and it broke every time we tried to get the slice in our plates.
I would say it was an alright experience not something exceptional. We might go back if around the neighborhood."}
{"text":"We had been back last weekend at Pizza e Pazzi with a party of 6.  For appetizer, we had fried calamari and grilled octopus, as well as the Burrata e Parma.  This was the first time we tried the Burrata and it was absolutely fantastic.  The plate had whole Italian Burrata topped with Prosciutto di Parma served on a bed of arugula.  For entree, we had beef tenderloin (this was not on the menu, as it was one of the specials, and it was amazing), mushroom risotto (ordered many times, always delicious), as well as various heavenly pizzas (which are baked in a wood-fired oven in less than 90 seconds, a must try!).  Everything was DELECTABLE!!!

This is a very cozy and friendly family-owned restaurant.  They are warm, lovely, hard-working people with great talent at what they do; dining at their restaurant has a homey feel to it.  All food is homemade and scrumptiously delicious.  Everything looks just as good as it tastes, as the platters are very inviting and appetizing.

It has been a pleasure to get to know this family and enjoy their art of and passion for authentic Italian cuisine.

Can't wait to go back for more!"}
{"text":"Like someone  else said before, nothing really especial, just decent .
Try to keep it simple, I think their Neapolitana is their best choice.
My two friends had the pizza with procciuto and Arugula $19 each, personal size, it was fresh but missing a lot of flavour. A bit pricy, 
I ordered one of their pasta dishes and it was tasty but the portion size was extremely small, smaller than a kids size, for this reason I found it over price as well."}
{"text":"This Neapolitan Pizzeria deserves its time to shine in the Toronto VERO Pizza limelight!

I always go for the classic, Margherita with bufala mozzarella and every time it's pure pleasure in my mouth!

The staff is great, all of our servers have spoken Italian and when you phone a reservation they make you smile with their \"Ciao Bella\" and \"Grazie Bella\" remarks!

They used to have a frizzantino (non-sweet) red wine, Gragnano which is the only wine anyone should ever drink with pizza (otherwise choose beer) and I wish they could bring it back

I hear they opened a new Jewish Italian, Roman pasta place, will have to give it a try!

If you're jonesing for an excellent VERO Neapolitan pizza... Pizza e Pazzi delivers!

Grazie Mille! Buonissimo!"}
{"text":"I didn't know anything about this until I parked my car to head to Marcellos. Fortunately, Marcellos was quite busy so we opted to go here instead, and I'm glad we did.  As others mentioned, it is a small place and they couldn't seat us right away but we opted to wait. Service the entire evening was pretty good and prompt. We weren't super hungry so we didn't order a lot - just wine, two apps and a pizza.

The octopus was fantastic - smelled, tasted great with a great texture - not rubbery nor is it like jello. Also ordered polenta, and the yellow tomato sauce definitely made the dish. They promptly informed us that there wasn't any rhubarb for the dish but we wanted it anyways.  For the pizza we had the zucca because of the unusual (for us) ingredient of butternut squash. I loved the crust and how all the flavours melded together. 

For dessert it was a tiramisu. It was house made the day before (good start) but alas.. The cream was fantastic but I wish there was more lady fingers in it. 

Definitely a solid find and worthwhile to visit."}
{"text":"Right off the bat I can tell you that I am not a pizza elitist. I'm just a guy who absolutely loves pizza in all it's shapes, sizes, flavors and permutations from the absolute greasy of the greasiest, to a perfectly flat crusted, gourmet-topping-covered pie.

A welcomed addition to what some might say Toronto's burgeoning Neopolitan-style (read: http://bit.ly/pnrVnr)  pizza craze is Pizza e Pazzi - loosely translated as \"Pizza and Crazy\" - in the increasingly popular Corso Italia neighbourhood of St. Clair West. 

Planning a Friday dinner with my lovely mother, whom I had not had a standard dine-out night with in quite some time, I thought I'd give PeP a shot given the wonderful review posted on BlogTO (http://bit.ly/q9MuDJ). Although they accept reservations via a dedicated e-mail address and phone number, I was told that the place wouldn't be busy enough to warrant a 7:00 PM reso for this particular Friday night. Cool.

Upon entering, we were sat immediately. My first impressions, visually, were quite pleasing. A definitely casual environment, lots of seating with an open kitchen and the piece-de-resistance wood burning pizza oven in the back makes me feel comfortable and yet, hungry. No pretension here!

Checking out the menu, despite the requisite offerings of salads, pastas and mains, my eye is caught to a few important pieces of information that sets my mouth a-water. In addition to being a certified, authentic creator of Neapolitan pizza there are three important rules: \"no pineapple * no half/half * no subsitutions [sic]\". This is great because I abhor pineapple on my pizza and it means these people are SERIOUS.

We are first brought a wire-cone of freshly baked bread & pita triangles, which go very well with the easy to pour canisters of EVOO on every table and the delightful surprise of a trio of antipasto, including a couple green olives, marinated mushrooms and another tasty veg spread that we quickly devoured without even having ordered a thing!

Buoyed by hype from the BlogTO review, I don't hesitate to order us the Fried Risotto Balls with Fior-di-Latte mozzarella. They arrive minutes later with a Bruschetta garnish and we dig in. WOW. The rice is perfectly cooked, and the cheese is both gooey and adds a delightfully creamy texture. Coupled with a great crispy deep fried-ness, these tasty (albeit quite heavy) balls are a win. 

Okay, now on to the star of the show. I take complete control of the meal here and order the standard Margherita, which all pizza-heads know is the standardized test of a purportedly authentic Neapolitan style pie. Our pizzas are served to us atop giant pizza style plates with the word \"Pizza\" strewn across in all sorts of kitchy fonts. Nice touch.

Upon my utensils hitting the pie, which meets my expectations at first glance with a smattering of melted buffalo mozzarella, risen and slightly blackened crust, light-red tomato sauce and delicately adorned basil leaves, I can already tell I'm in for a treat. I cut my first slice and realize immediately that a new contender for the Toronto pizza crown has arrived. The dough is soft and fluffy without being mushy, the tomato sauce is tangy, tasty and kind of addictive and the mozzarella is the slippery white gold that keeps me on a steady rhythm of intense pizza consumption.

Having devoured our pies, sopped up the remaining tomato sauce using the thick crust and paid our (reasonably priced, I might add) bill, we both agree that Pizza e Pazzi is absolutely deserving of it's namesake; Yes, they have pizza here. And yes, it is absolutely crazy if you don't take a date, loved one or perhaps a solo mission over to one of the best new authentic Neapolitan pizza places in Hogtown!"}
{"text":"My party of four was actually so offended that after ordering our drinks we decided that we couldn't stay for food and ended up across the street at Mezzetta (which is super awesome by the way).

Our server was almost immediately annoyed with us. Was it because I attempted to order a wine (from their wine list)  that was apparently \"horrible and not a good wine and even if it was in stock he would not have allowed me to have it\" or was it because I asked for a description of the 2 alternate wines he suggested because I had never heard of them (no description was offered even after asking) OR (and this really seemed to upset our server) was it because my friend asked for water? It seemed a huge inconvenience to him that he had to bring us water. At which point it was time to take our food order. And this is what put him over the edge...
I asked to have no cheese on my  pizza (all the pizza have cheese). I'm mildly lactose intolerant and some days I just can not handle a lot of cheese. This was not allowed. (and not because the restaurant was busy. There was only one other table with people) I said I needed more time to make a choice. He never returned and refused to even look in the direction of our table after this. 

*FYI - I've been to Italy and you most certainly can have both pizzas and pastas that are not loaded with cheese. I get that they want to uphold the integrity of their dishes but a lot of authentic Italian dishes do not have cheese.

Another server came and offered to take our food order but we just paid the bill for our drinks and left. I will never return."}
{"text":"The only reason this is not a five star review is because I had such a poor experience at this restaurant my second time around (mostly because of the service) that I had to adjust my review accordingly.  

I have been to this charming restaurant for dinner twice now in the last 30 days.  The first time, my two girlfriends took me out for my birthday.  Our waiter, Reuben, was amazing.  Friendly and funny.  I would insist on being seated in his section next time.  On that occasion, we had called ahead and asked if they could make us the lobster risotto and they gladly accommodated us.  That night, the entire meal was memorable, especially my main dish - the lobster gnocchi served with a half lobster with the gnocchi in a rose sauce.  It was easily the best gnocchi I have ever tasted.  It melted in your mouth and the sauce was divine.  I was dreaming about this dish for weeks.  

Imagine my disappointment when I asked for the rose sauce to be replaced in the gnocchi con gamberetti e zucchine which is served in a cherry tomato sauce with tiger shrimp and zucchini.  I am not a fan of tomato sauce but our waiter told me that the kitchen was \"too busy\" to replace the sauce.  I would assumed that the kitchen already had the sauce made it would not have been difficult to replace the sauce.  

We were a party of 8 women celebrating another birthday.  We were seated all the way in the back and our waiter didn't have any interest in our table whatsoever.  I had to ask him at least 2-4 each times for more bread, some water and balsamic vinegar.  At one point, when we asked for more bread, he sarcastically said \"leave room for the main course girls\".  Are you kidding me?  He never came around to ask us how our meals were.  At the end of the evening, he brought out some of the lattes and desserts but one of the ladies at our table never did receive her tiramisu.  When I reminded him that her latte and dessert had not arrived, he sarcastically replied that it was coming.  He then brought her coffee but never did bring her dessert.  I guess he didn't care about giving us decent service since he put his 15% tip on the bill at the end of the night.  

In fact, I was quite disappointed with my entree, not only because I did not enjoy the sauce but also because the shrimp were grilled with their shells on.  The shells were difficult to remove and they were overcooked.  He only bothered to come by after we were finished eating.  I had the same issue with the appetizer - a special that evening (grilled shrimp over arugula salad with warm mushrooms).  Very disappointing.  

The highlight of the meal was the dessert.  We had the pizza nutella
(pizza with a nutella base and your choice of strawberry, banana or coconut) and even though there was \"problem with the bananas\" (not sure what the problem was) and we had the pizza with just the nutella, it was still awesome.  I also really enjoyed the angioletti fritti (deep fried pizza dough, topped with nutella and icing sugar).  It was a huge portion - enough to share for all of us and we left most of it on the table since we were too full by that point.  

I love the food and atmosphere (although I would not want to sit in the back again since that part of the restaurant is dark (black paint) and lacking in any character which is in abundance in the rest of the restaurant with it's open kitchen and brick walls).  I also think the price is quite reasonable and Reuben is a wonderful waiter.  The owner was also lovely.  He came by early in the evening to check on us.  Our waiter (a relatively short fellow with curly hair - didn't catch his name) was probably the worst server I have had in as long as I can remember.  He actually ruined for me what would otherwise have been a very enjoyable evening.  I was very disappointed with his service and attitude."}
{"text":"As a young man, I was offered a key insight into the world of  business. 

A business either grows, or it dies. 

It's hard to give a glowing review to a chain, with outposts as far flung as Etobicoke (pity them, lest they receive a late-night visit from a certain inebriated public official). 

But that's what Pizza e Pazzi is becoming. 

And it's not hard to see why. 

I've visited a few times. On every occasion I was greeted quickly, by a server practiced enough to work at a finer dining establishment. Sliding into a booth, my water glass appears and never dips below half-full. 

A basket of bread, including puffy, tomato-strewn foccacia soon appears, sided with dips ranging from sweetish tapenade to spicy giardinera. 

I opt for a different pizza each time. Some red-sauced, some white. Barely crunchy veg adorn one option, while scads of prosciutto andother. Crusts are uniformly well-blistered and cooked through even to the centre of the pie. 

Tiramisu is uniquely good. The waiter promises it's the best in the city. I'd be hard pressed to prove him wrong. 

Coffee is almost strong enough, but still pretty fine. 

I'd welcome a location opening up a little bit closer by. Bring your real estate agent, I might even know a site :)"}
{"text":"Came to this beautiful restaurant this afternoon for lunch with my family and not a single person left disappointed. The service was a bit slow, but I think they may have been understaffed. However our waiter was very helpful and knowledgeable. Our coffees were satisfactory in taste but beautifully presented. The food took a bit of time to be served , but nothing unreasonable considering the size of our party. Most importantly, THE FOOD WAS DELICIOUS. So fresh, so flavourful. Very high quality. We would definitely return to this amazing restaurant if we are ever in the neighbourhood again."}
{"text":"Last night, I was lucky to have gone to PIzza e Pazzi for a second time.

I went with a couple of friends (based on my recommendation).

Although we noticed one bottle to be over-priced, considerably, on the menu, I believe we had a very reasonably priced, and good-tasting, Chianti.

We shared a appetizer of rice balls with mozzarella - it was crispy and tasty.

One of my friends ordered a red pizza and was brought a white version.
When we questioned our waiter on this, he said \"I think that one should be on the white menu\" ... well, that's not really a good enough answer; he definitely should have informed us before finalizing our order.

While our table had very mixed reviews of the pizza, I was extremely pleased with the product. I had the Tre Funghi.

The crust was crispy in parts and bagel-like in other. Perfect in my mind.
The sauce was tasty ... the mushrooms delectable.

The spicy oil was good ... however, I would have loved some pepperoncini like they have at Terroni (which happens to be one of my fave spots for pizza).

Most importantly, I was blown away by the engagement of the owners ... Sandrelle and Danilo. They stayed at our table for a good while chatting with us about everything and nothing. 

We were treated to Grappa at the end of the evening ... and for dessert, Danilo put together a plate of everything so that we could try it all.

The new location is opening soon at Christie and St. Clair ... watch out LIbretto and Queen Margherita, there is a new kid in town, and they want to take the crown!

Salute Pizza e Pazzi!"}
{"text":"I went here with a group of three and our evening was plesant. 
The restaurant was not full but there was just enough tables filled to create a nice cozy environment. 

The ambiance of the overall restaurant was great and I really enjoyed their decor. 

Our waiter was wonderful. He was kind, funny and extremely helpful. I love when waiters are knowledgeable and offer recommendations and specials without YOU having to ask. 

I had the gnocchi special which was in a delicious cream sauce and topped with truffle. It was GREAT flavour wise but it's one of those dishes that once you are at the 10th bite, it just feels overwhelming since the flavours are so powerful and strong.

My friend had the calzone- the only downside was no sauce to dip it in but she said it was very delicious.

Our other friend had the caprese bianca pizza which was also delicious. You could taste the fresh ingredients and it was perfectly baked.

I would come here again as it's local to where we reside."}
{"text":"only one selection of house red

house salad was excellent, the dressing was the best"}
{"text":"We love trying out new restaurants. We usually go to pulcinella or thyme 4 for Italian food. We tried this new place tonight for the first time. The place has been opened apparently just for one month and they are busy! We didnt have a reservation but they were able to accomodate us. 

We ordered a seafood pasta dish and a pizza. For food I say it is about 4/5. Comparable to Pulcinella and better than Thyme 4. We liked it and would come back.

The service was great and it has a nice and homely atmosphere. We had a tall waiter from Sudbury. Cant remember his name but he was very entertaining and was an all around great waiter. So it definitely made the dinner experience even better! So for service 5/5!"}
