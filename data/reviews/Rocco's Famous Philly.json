{"text":"Well I wish I would've read the reviews before coming here for lunch. I had a choice between subway and this place and since I always try to support the local guys I picked this place.  My experience was no different than the previous reviews. Dysfunctional! There was one guy taking orders and serving and one guy in the back doing all the cooking. Still haven't figured out how to multi-task. I watched as the server/order taker  forgot fries for the 4 other diners ahead of me. It took 31 minutes to get my lunch. This is just way too long, especially if there were only 3 diners ahead - and I ordered mine right they placed their order.  They finished up their lunch while I was still waiting. I even went up to the counter after 22 minutes of waiting to figure out the delay and I heard te cook ask the server to get the rest of the ingredients for my sandwich. The order/server guy apologized and offered a coupon if I came back. I declined.  I had to eat in the car since my lunch break was over. Guess what? My fries were wrong!! I ordered sweet potato and got regular. Since I already left I called them to let them know. Normally I would let this go but this just added to the whole bad experience.  The order taker/server apologized and said the cook was new, he had only been there for one month. A MONTH? Seriously?! And he still can't figure out how to drop sweet potato vs regular? Or perhaps make more than one 6\" Philly cheesesteak at a time?! Ridiculous!!! The sandwich was good, not gonna lie but not enough to get me to go back, even for a free lunch as offered.  It is a shame the place is being run by a couple of guys who have no business running a restaurant."}
{"text":"Where do I start...we got there and the place looked like a little mom and pop. Not much thought or decorating gone into it. That was the best part of the visit! We ordered, myself, my wife and my nephew. Their credit card machine was broken so I had to go next door to get cash from the atm. So after we ordered we waited and waited. There was one other table in the restaurant of 5 or 6 people. I could tell they were annoyed because their food came out in stages plus they had an internet coupon and I heard the owner say we charge gratuity on that coupon! So it really got them no savings. Back to us, we waited more than 30 minutes! Now for the three of us, our bill was 33.00. Rule of thumb:if you wait longer than the amount of your bill something is wrong. I finally went to the counter and said I will pay for the drinks, but I want my money back, we are going somewhere else. The OWNER tells me your food is ready and brought out one plate. I said I dont want it I just want my money back. He says well I already have cooked the food you cant have your money back, just take the food with you. By this time the rest on the food had come up and it looked dried out!  He said we are not fast food, this is not cheap food and it takes time to make. I said I can appreciate that, but these sandwiches and fries dont take 30 minutes to make. Mind you I am a chef and I have managed and ran restaurants for 20 years.  I looked at the sandwiches and told him about my experience and told him that I can take one look at the mushrooms and tell they are canned! I pay 8 bucks for a sandwich with canned mushrooms I better get it quicker than 30 minutes...and I paid .50 extra for the mushrooms.  The owner then tells me, I will give you $25 back. I said are you serious, im a customer who is leaving your restaurant unsatisfied and you are gonna charge me 8 bucks for drinks?!? I said I have never treated a customer that way in 20 years. He said this isn't McDonald's and I said it is not full service either. He said well I have to cover the costs of the food because it is cooked. I said you eat it then I dont want it. Then he said, do you want me to call the police, I said call them, I am sure they will see my side of things. I was seeing red and was about to lose it!  When I called his bluff, he pulled another five out of the register and slammed it on the counter. I grabbed it and walked out swearing! I will never, ever go there again and I will tell everyone that ever says they are going there of my experience.  Rocco, learn to treat your customers correctly and figure out your system because obviously you do not have one. You dont have 30 minute food. You dont have a 10 minute menu. If you dont, you will be out of business. Maybe instead of taking all of the money out of the register, you should: stop the guy from smoking his e cigarette in the back food prep area, tell the kids you have delivering food to take his gloves off when he comes out of the kitchen and also train him. Dont just tell him what to do. Besides he should not be wiping sweat off of his forehead with his gloves on either. No stars!!!!"}
{"text":"So I have read all the reviews and I understand some people's complaints but 1 star shouldn't be the last words because your just angry it's about the entire experience from service to the food. The overall experience.  I drive an ambulance and on occasion we fill up at the gas station next door and I have smelled it on multiple occasions and today was the day I finally stopped in. Not letting the reviews scare me because I can come up with my own conclusion especially being that there is alot of 5 star reviews.  So needles to say I ordered my philly steak which is what it's all about right being a steak place and being in a hurry  I had to get it to go being an ambulance driver everything is unexpected and go..go...go. The place is a simple place made for eating or taking an order to go  My sandwich was amazing it was fresh and cheesy and didn't take long to get my order either. The meat was soft and juicy and was seasoned just right the bread was also fresh and soft not all falling apart and old like some places I have been. I give this place a 5 star review based on the fact it's a simple place with the best meats and cheeses fast and the owner was a very friendly and approachable guy. I will be a repeat customer and I am going to tell the guys from the fire department and other ambulance drivers that this is definitely a place to get one of the best philly sandwiches I have had the pleasure of going down the chute.. lol"}
{"text":"This place is the definition of dysfunctional. Employee's/owners having profanity laced arguments in front of customers. Food is OK but be prepared to wait forever while you wonder just how this place stays open. Dining room is full of angry faces right now."}
{"text":"Went here several weeks ago with a $10.00 discount (buy $20.00 minimum)  from Restaurants.com. Had to really work at getting bill up to $20.00. After taking our order, the owner added $5.00 for a tip--he indicated that people were so cheap they didn't leave anything in the tip jar so he took it upon himself to take care of the matter. This amounted to more that a 20%  tip (in a deli,)  and was not posted anywhere, nor were we told ahead of time that this was the case. My husband paid while I went to the table.  When I later asked him what the total bill amounted to he said he gave them $26.00 and some change. So, a lunch that should have cost about $15.00 ($25.00 food + tax,) ended up costing $36.00 and some change  ($26.00 cash + $10.00 coupon that we did not get credit for.)  I wanted to ask about getting $10.00 for our coupon, but my husband thought this would \"create a scene.\"   By the way, the food was really good, but don't know if I can afford to go back with the tricky math that is used."}
{"text":"Great food close to my house, but I can only give 3stars because they flat out don't want to answer the phone. I've given Rocco's about 10 chances now because I like their food, but I give up Stewart. Please hire some help to handle the weekend rush. I would love to start ordering again."}
{"text":"NOTE: this was months age (I hope things have changed). We were asked if we wanted cheese whiz in our sandwiches which took a long, long time to make. I don't think i need to say anymore. I'm pretty sure they can do better, they were just understaffed that day."}
{"text":"This joint just opened up, it was recomended to me by an employee of mine so I decided to grab lunch and give it a shot. I will admit at lunch time I am not very adventerous when it comes to what I eat. After perusing the menu for a moment I decided digging in to individual pieces of roasted chicken or ribs just sounded like a bad idea I decided on the pulled pork sandwhich with a side of mac n chee.  I ordered it to go and it was brought to me for dine in but no biggie, the cashier rang it up wrong so I ended up eating for slightly cheaper than I probably should have....I still think he didnt charge me for the mac n chee.   After seeing their trailer smoker parked out fron in the parking lot I thought, wow nice they must cater...as i was enjoying my sandwhich I later witnessed the cook working his magic out on that grill in the parking lot which was interesting, especially when it gets to be in the triple digits here.  Anywho...sandwhich was decent, a little too much bbq sauce for my liking and it was a tad too sweet in my opinion as well but the different spice they added to their mac n chee made up for it. The mac n chee had a nice little kick to it which I enjoyed.  All in all, think home made KFC (roasted not fried) with some BBQ options. The place is small and not the cleanest but still comfortable enough to eat a messy meal in. I also forgot to mention they serve chicken and waffles, not too many places around here do that and it could potentially be a huge draw."}
{"text":"I'll preface this with the fact that I love your food. I have however waited for over an our on more than one occasion for food, once in the dining room. Also brought clients to your location after telling them how great the food was to find that the shop wasn't opened up 45 minutes after your posted start time, that was quite embarrassing. Also im not a fan of my food being cooked/presented to me by someone wearing flip flops. I really hope your business does succeed but im afraid it would be despite the current sloppy management practices."}
{"text":"It's to bad this place is closed now. Stewart was a good guy and put his heart into cooking. My husband and I would go to roccos 1-2 times a month. We knew there was a wait so it never upset us. We always got the same thing and it was always amazing! The time we went we noticed a hugee price increase and menu change. The food tasted different too. That was @about the beginning of the year. The other day we decided we couldn't give up and went back to find them closed down. It's really sad to see them go....there isn't another good cheese steak around (that we have found)"}
{"text":"This place has gone downhill since Rocco sold it, the quality is literally disgusting in my opinion. Maybe it was an off day but my last visit was terrible. The meat was so overdone it was on the verge of burnt. Onions and cheese were so cooked into the meat you couldn't tell what was what, and I'm not exaggerating here. We couldn't get more than two bites in before the taste was so unbearable that we threw the sandwiches away and just went to a chain sub shop.  Previous visits, again with the previous owner, were great. The quality justified the higher prices and long wait. Honestly they've gone from being, \"the best cheesesteak\" to a place that I'll never return to. Sad because I haven't been able to find a cheesesteak as good as what they used to serve here."}
{"text":"I have two issues. The first is these guys seem be unable to multi-task. The can only produce one order at a time, so the wait times are ridiculous. The second is they changed the bread. They went from a quality bread to some low quality crap.  I've never seen the same employees twice, and they never seem to have food service experience. It is quite dysfunctional. It's obvious the owner has no experience.  Overall, it was bearable unril a combination of bad bread and a price increase from $7 to $10. I can live with the price increase, but not the bad bread. I'm done."}
{"text":"I have been there 3 times now.  The food is actually very good but the service stinks.  The owner is constantly yelling at employees.  No one cleans the place.  The second time I went there I arrived as the owner was taking a phone order.  The order was for about 10 people.  He cooked the phone order first as I had to wait 30 minutes for my order.  Not the best customer service skills."}
{"text":"I had a few issues as others regarding food preparation as far as appearance of sweating on or near food by employees during prep and general customer service things such as the dining room needing more attention but not cleaning tables with windex next to people eating, Dr Pepper in cans not fountain? Try to support family business so prob will try again after they've been open longer. Great bread for the Philly .. Order extra cheese : )"}
{"text":"Meh. Food wasn't that good and portion size is very small for the money spent. I did delivery and their delivery fee doesn't make much sense if I spend over $30 for food."}
{"text":"My recommendation - order your sandwiches and take them home. While the sandwiches are decent, the service is pretty bad. We went for lunch on Saturday around 11:30. When placed our order we were told that if we want combo meals we had to get chips instead of fries because their fryer wasn't working. There were only 3 different types of chips on the rack and half of them were already expired.  My son ordered soda, when it came it tasted really bad. When he asked if they could replace the syrup in their soda fountain, they said they were out. I ordered a root beer float, when it came it had chocolate ice cream in it instead if vanilla and didn't taste right. We asked the guy at the register what is going on, he said someone ate the vanilla ice cream and he didn't know about it. Why in the world would you put chocolate ice cream in a root beer float and not even tell the customer? They have been open for 4 months but still can't get it together. I will not be back."}
{"text":"Give it a try, you will not regret it.  Their cheesesteaks are amazing!    My only regret is that this place opened a few months ago and I didn't discover them sooner.    Nice job Stu and Rocco, we'll be frequenting your place."}
{"text":"Great sandwiches twice from this place, definitely a diamond in the rough that I will frequent much more.   It's not much to really look at on the inside with a few tables and pretty beat up look, but the cook Dakota does some true magic on his flat top and with his homemade seasoning.  I've had the Philly cheesesteak twice now fully loaded with an assortment of peppers, mushrooms, and fried onions and will definitely find myself getting a few more.  Major recommendation though is the onion rings, they take a bit of time but truly the time and energy that is put into them is well worth the wait when they arrive golden brown and overflowing with flavor."}
{"text":"Very good/authentic cheesesteak sandwiches. Took a little longer than expected for our food to come out, but when it did it was hot and delicious."}
{"text":"Love this place!  philly cheesesteak sandwich was awesome!  We ordered sweet potato fries to share and  I don't really like sweet potato fries ... they were SO GOOD we ordered another order because I devoured the first order!  LOVE that they deliver as well!!"}
{"text":"The first time I came here, I was pleased, but the last two visits have made me change my mind. The food is good, but the service is sub-par. I used their online ordering system with a scheduled pickup time. I got there and the food was not ready. They told me that they don't check the app regularly, so I should call in the future. So I had to wait for them to make my philly steak. They did not apologize for the inconvenience. The next time, I called in the order. It was a 30-minute wait. I don't know why it took so long; they were not busy. When I got there, they had a sign on the register stating that the credit card reader was broken. I was lucky I had cash, but they didn't tell me when I called in. It drove one customer away while I was there. Customer service seems fairly inconsistent. I probably won't be back anytime soon."}
{"text":"Sub was ok, but nothing great. Fries were straight from the box and covered in salt. Staff was ok. Was told that it's new mgmt. too many other places to go than to make a trip back."}
{"text":"My first visit and I was impressed. Hard to find a good Philly Cheesesteak in AZ. Stu made my sandwich to perfection and he was very friendly. TRY IT, YOU'LL LIKE IT!"}
{"text":"Went in and enjoyed some awesome food - totally love it!  Made fresh to order, just the right amount of all the good stuff....cheese, heat, bread and MEAT. YUM....sweet potato fries and finished off with a nice cannoli.  Really great, we'll be back."}
{"text":"Damn good philly and the best part---this place is exactly what it's supposed to be! No frills, not corporate owned, just a couple of dudes making good food. I got the Philly with wiz and cherry peppers and I wouldn't change a thing (except more cheese but I'm from the Midwest). The bread was chewy and soaked up all the juice from the flavorful steak and those peppers had some kick! We paired this with a coke and hot crinkled fries and wow we were full. Rocco himself came out to make sure we were happy---and that ladies and gentleman, is what a restaurant should be. Haven't been to a sandwich place like this since I lived back home. We will back again and again :)"}
{"text":"Walking in, I was pretty skeptical- the place could use some art on the walls and a can of paint. Maybe a better font for the menus too, rather than just capitalized serif fonts on plain printer paper taped to the wall.  But the food? Delicious. I lived back east for a while and miss a good philly cheesesteak. Great size and great prices- the owner came out and chit chatted with me and was very kind.   I would also advise that they get a website and post the menu there. Looking at the reviews here I had no idea they even had other sides other than chips. I'll have to try their fries next time.  TL;DR: Good food, but needs work on ambiance/appeal"}
{"text":"Rocco's gone Sold to someone else changing the menu.. goingnto offer different hot sandwiches... and beans and rice GO FIGURE??"}
{"text":"I wish I could give this place negative stars. My son and I went in there for the first time this afternoon. We waited almost 10 minutes for somebody to wait on us and take our order.  At the time we were the only ones in the place. Three employees came up to the counter and didn't even say \"Hello\" let alone ask to see if anyone had taken our order. Then we waited 20 minutes for a hamburger and a cheesesteak. When I went to the counter to find out what was taking so long they told me that the hamburger meat was frozen and it takes a long time to cook.  When I asked how much longer I was told, with attitude, it won't take much longer.  After we got our food I had to go back up and ask for napkins and catsup and I was told they are on the table but they weren't.  I had to tell the guy twice that they weren't there before he would give me some.  While we sat and ate our food another couple who came in after us received their order.  The fries were burned to a crisp.  I was surprised that anyone would serve something so bad.   One of the people (Rocco?) came out to inquire how they were enjoying their meal and when the girl complained about the fries he told her that some people like them \"well done\".  She said that she wouldn't mind \"well done\" but these were burned.  He made another excuse about the potatoes and then offered to make them a new order which they accepted.  1 Philly Cheesesteak.  1 Cheeseburger.  1 order of fries.  1 soda.  $18 + \"tip\" = $20.  I had really hoped we found a new, local, fun place to eat.  Now, I'll be looking forward to the next business that occupies this space when Rocco's goes out of business."}
{"text":"Food was below average, prices are high for what you get, order was wrong and part of our take out order was missing, wait times are atrocious even when they're not busy, and they neglected to use my resturant.com certificate that was handed directly to them."}
{"text":"Wow!! It's too bad that you have to even give them one star to write a review!! We placed our order for delivery at 12:20 pm. Received a confirmation that it would be delivered between 1:15-1:25 pm.   Oh did I mention our order came out to $40 for two people!   It's now 1:15 and I received a call from the someone at the restaurant asking what did I want on the hoagie (even though we had already written in detail under the additional request section when we ordered.) They also advise me that the delivery driver needed to talk to me. She gets on the phone and asks where I'm located?! Keep in mind I had already provided my address. I end up having to give her turn by turn directions and she said she'd call if she couldn't find us.   At 1:25 I received another call from the same person at the restaurant, this time it's to let me know that they are not legally allowed to make burgers \"rare\" so he cooked my burger well done! Even though when I placed my order \"rare\" was an option?! This is when I should of just cancelled the whole order!   Now, it's 1:40 and the delivery driver is just showing up! I asked her what took so long and she looked at me as if I were speaking a different language and proceeds to ask me what time was I supposed to get the order. I said between 1:15-1:25. She then said well what time is it, and I said 1:40, and she said oh, well I'm sorry we were really busy with it being lunch time and all, and she said doesn't even work for them they were just really busy so she was doing them a favor?! WHAT DOES THAT EVEN MEAN?!   So, onto the food... The burger, was of course, over cooked and dry! The onion rings were $4.99 and we only got seven. The mozzarella sticks were cold! The fries tasted and looked as if there were fried in old oil! The only thing I can say is their bread was good, but $40's later I just feel like I got ripped off! Never again!"}
{"text":"ordered delivery from Rocco's for our first experience.  NOT disappointed.  food arrived hot and very very tasty.  awesome courteous delivery too.  we will TOTALLY be back."}
{"text":"The food was excellent. Yes a little of a wait but not bad at all!!! 4 people arrived all at once but the food came out hot and fresh.  Highly recommend,  the owner is genuine and attentive"}
{"text":"Ooooookay. So this is a seriously delicious place. I decided to try this place today for lunch. I am so glad I did! I had the Philly cheesesteak sandwich and it was glorious! I topped that off with a cannoli and oh my God it was fantastic. The prices were a little much, but it was completely worth it. It was just absolutely out of this world. without hesitation, would recommend going to this place. I got my food delivered, and the chef called me to make sure that he was making my food exactly how I wanted it. I've never had that happen before, where a place is so concerned with making sure I get exactly what I wanted. In a word... YUM."}
{"text":"First off.....you never insult the customer. One of the older gentlemen let my girl know that it was only gonna be a 15 minute wait. Well we waited 30 minutes.   After getting our food my girl explained that she had an appointment. Then one of the gentlemen stated that if she wanted it fast she should go to McDonalds.   Really!!!!  Then for your 5.49 you get a sandwich smaller than a subway sandwich.   We will never go here again  I suggest you don't go either."}
{"text":"Service was super slow when we were there and there wasn't a lot of people in there either... Like one in front of us actually. However, if you aren't in a hurry the Steak Philly and Chicken Philly are very good!! Not a huge fan of the fries but the sandwiches are all very good."}
{"text":"I can't remember the last time I had such a bad experience at a food place.  It was seriously one thing after another, I will never go back and advise others to stay away. I went here for lunch on monday.  The atmosphere is dingy at best, you will want to get your food to go because it looks dirty and bare bones.  The credit card machine?  Broken. I was lucky I had enough cash for a cheesesteak.  I waited over 20 minutes for the cheesesteak which I ordered to-go.  I nearly had to just leave without it because I ran out of time (work lunch break).  I ended up waiting and then having to rush back to work with about 2 minutes left in my lunch break in which to eat because it took so long to get my food. Once I got back to work and opened my sandwich, I discover it has mayo on it. I'm allergic so there was no saving the sandwich, I had to throw it out and just skip lunch.  So I actually can't comment on the food, only on the service.   I waited over 20 minutes for something I couldn't even eat.  I called as soon as I saw the mayo to complain because I was already annoyed that I had waited for so long.  I spoke with the owner and he offered me the opportunity to return to get a free sandwich.  At this point, I was out of time and had no desire to go back and wait a ridiculous amount of time for a new sandwich that may or may not be right.  Which is what I told him.  He then told me that it does not ordinarily take so long but they were a green restaurant (good for them, seriously) and they had to switch out the gas. I went there at 1230pm on a monday, there are better times to change over your gas that aren't during what most places would consider a normal lunch time!  He then blamed me for the mayo by saying I ordered incorrectly.  I ordered a cheesesteak with lettuce and tomato and cheese whiz.  He pointed at a sheet and asked if I wanted any other toppings.  I said no.  Well he took that to mean that I wanted a cheesesteak HOAGIE which has lettuce, tomato, olive oil, mayo and raw onions.  I said that I ordered the cheesesteak with lettuce and tomato and not the hoagie without the olive oil, onions, or mayo because I thought it would be easier for them to just add 2 things as opposed to take away 3.  His explanation for the mix up?  They didn't think I knew what I was ordering and thought I had meant \"hoagie\" but was too confused to order it, so they gave the  cheesesteak hoagie.  So if you do decide to brave this dump, bring cash, expect long delays, and be very, very careful how you order because they will assume that you don't know what you want and give you something else.  I had been really excited to find a good cheesesteak place and I was pretty disappointed."}
