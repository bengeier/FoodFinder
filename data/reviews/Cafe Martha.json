{"text":"Man, I wanted to like this \"no frills\" place, but there is not much positive that I can say about it. 

1st, the staff wasn't very friendly. 2nd, the Sprite and lemonade had no taste. 3rd, My sandwich (turkey, spinach, a red pepper spread) was gross and my tiny little side of tortellini had the same strange taste as the sandwich. I had to take a bite of my kid's PB&J to get the taste out of my mouth. And 4th, when we showed up the deli slices of turkey were sitting out on the counter and the remained there for 20-30min+ plus. 

What a bummer."}
{"text":"Caf√© Martha is an interesting little sandwich shop in the middle of Old Town. I describe it as interesting because the restaurant is fairly large, but the menu is limited to just deli items. I'm not sure how they plan on filling the place by just serving sandwiches.  It was a Saturday at noon, and I was the only one in the place, yet I felt like I was being rushed to place my order.  Even after I told the lady it was my first time there, she did not offer any suggestions or tell me anything about the menu.  I had a veggie sandwich, which was okay, but definitely nothing special.   I ordered Hottie a roast beef sandwich with havarti, he seemed much happier with his sandwich than I was.  Needless to say, unless I need a quick bite and I'm in the area, I probably won't go back.  There was nothing wrong with my food, but it just wasn't memorable."}
{"text":"You enter this place and you wonder if you are still in Old Town.  There is no super stylized chic decor or over the top Southwestern flair.  Just a plain setting adorned by a few works of art from a local artist.  But since I don't go out to lunch for ambiance, I will focus on the food.

Superb sandwiches, perhaps a tad overpriced.  The Grilled Arizona is a particular favorite that is full on flavor and light...well, lighter on the calories.  The sides are decent and the portions healthy.  A good spot that emphasizes food over atmosphere.  How many places in the neighborhood can say that?"}
{"text":"The food is good but I feel it is overpriced for what you get.  $12 for a sandwich and soda seems a bit higher than normal.  The place is very dull, just a warehouse feel with nothing for decor.  Some TV's with news or something would be nice to see.  The place is just boring."}
{"text":"Cute little hidden away cafe.  No frills, which is rare over here, and not as snooty as the previous owners of the picnic company.

The half sandwich and soup combo is perfect for lunch and the cafe Jackie is awesome.  However I do think that 18 bucks for two half sandwich/soup combos and one drink is rather pricey for a sandwich...

The decor is lacking, although I like the fact that there are no TVs, makes you focus on their food and your company :)"}
{"text":"I go to Martha's as often as possible after a tip came from some girls i worked with-
I LOVE it! Delicious sandwiches and salads.
I highly recommend it to all of my friends and make excuses to have lunch dates so I can go there."}
{"text":"I work in Old Town Scottsdale, so it is great to have a local place that delivers great food quickly!  I ordered the Cafe Heather ($8.50) sandwich and the delivery was so quick it was still warm when I got it!  The menu is limited to sandwiches, soups, and salads.  Cafe Martha is a great place for oversized sandwiches!"}
{"text":"Picnic Co...errrrr...no wait, Cafe Martha, oh how I've missed you, eh? I work in Old Town and well let's just say, there are not too many lunch eateries to choose from in the neighborhood. And in the industry I am in, I sometimes do not get a lunch hour. Thus, I have to run out quickly and grab a bite to bring back to eat at my desk (if I do not do as I should and bring something for lunch.). 

The former Picnic Co. was close, convenient, and fairly decent quality. More so than the cafe in the middle of our complex courtyard that has been dubbed by many in the company as \"Pasicko's\". So when Picnic Co. closed its doors last year, a lot of us in the building (more so my department) were dumbfounded and stumped on where to go. 

The word traveled quickly that Cafe Martha's was opening up where Picnic Co used to be. Would it be just as good as PC? Would the prices be reasonable? Only one way to find out! 

I walked in and saw 2 former PC employees working behind the counter. Okay, things are looking positive. A gentleman was stationed by the door with a guitar and amp playing some blues. Nice touch. Found out that the sister owners also own Baby K's in phoenix. 

On to the food - I ordered the Chef Salad, as I always did when it was PC with Ranch dressing. I got back to work and took my salad out of the bag. Can I get a side of lettuce with that turkey, ham, etc? SHEESH did they pack the meat on that salad!! I'm not complaining though! lol :) The ranch tasted homemade, which is what they claim all of their dressings to be. And because I am a sucker for sweets sometimes, I bought one of the giant rice krispie treats. YUM!  I was good and shared the rice krispie though a few coworkers.  

C.M. - I'll be back! :)"}
{"text":"Tried Cafe Martha for the first time using a Groupon NOW over the weekend.   Quiet for Saturday lunch, there were 2-3 other tables in use.  I get the impression this is more of a weekday place serving office workers nearby.  Not much for atmosphere, no music or TV or other distractions.  There are a few tables & chairs outdoors on the sidewalk.

We tried 2 gourmet sandwiches - Vegetarian and Cafe Heather.  Both were quite good.  Vegetarian is something like a caprese on a brioche roll with a nice pesto sauce.  Both accompanied by pickle & a small cup of tasty homemade pasta salad for $8.50.  Add $2 for drink & chips.  While we both enjoyed the meal, it seemed a little pricey for the goods.  I would like to see their menu expanded a bit, but I guess if they are just a lunch place, it's adequate.  

The food experience was good and if I was in the area again, I would stop in and maybe try one of their salads next time.

Another plus - there is plenty of parking right outside.  Nice find, especially in Old Town Scottsdale."}
{"text":"This review is dedicated to lunch buddy, Eli M., who doesn't remember the first time he visited Cafe Martha.  By the way, throwing away your basket with your other trash at Cafe Martha shall now be called pulling an Eli.  Come on man, don't you remember now!?

Good food?  Yes, come for the food.  There is only one other good reason to come.  They have mostly sandwiches, and the sandwiches are good.  I usually don't like slaw, but the olive slaw has the right amount of olive taste to make it tasty.  And I don't know what it is about those puff chips, but I can't get enough of them.  As a small side comes with your sandwich, you may not need to get the chips.  They also offer a meal deal.  And there are salads and soups.  

Good service?  Uh . . . the first time we came my friend, who shall remain nameless because this review isn't dedicated to him, announced that it was our first time and asked what was good.  He got a nice glare that said, \"Stop hassling me and just pick something.\"  It feels like you are that college kid returning home just for a quick bite because you're too lazy to make something for yourself, and you get the apathetic pleasantries with a homey touch.

Atmosphere?  Uh . . . tucked on the edge of Old Town Scottsdale and off the beaten path, it has a provincial, small town cafe feel with a hint of charm.  Chalkboards and whiteboards proclaim the menu and encircle the counter where you place your order.  Off to the left is the seating area.  It is unclear whether you are supposed to leave your basket on the table or place it on the counter, and sometimes people pull an Eli before they place their empty basket back on the counter.

Coupons?  Yes, and that is the other reason to come.  There are lots of them, and they remind us that it is time to visit Martha once again."}
{"text":"For great sandwiches inside or for take out head to Cafe Martha in Scottsdale. As other reviewers have noted, Martha's is down to earth in appearance and service. The portions are large enough to share especially if you add a small salad or cup of their delicious gumbo! Perfect for a picnic. Service by the owners or staff behind the counter. Upbeat attitude as the turkey reuben is to die for...Pricey for sandwich fare but very well worth it and like I said, a sandwhich is plenty for two to share!"}
{"text":"I bought a Groupon to try it out but found out they were closed on Saturday for the month of August. In September, I  called on Saturday before heading over and there was no answer. Before heading to San Diego for work, I called them on a weekday and still got no answer. Is this place still open?"}
{"text":"Wait staff was very friendly. Had a California BLT. OMG, never thought of putting avocado on a BLT, it was heavenly. The ice tea was perfect, the tortellini salad was very good, had artichokes in it. My two favorite things, avocado and artichokes. Life doesn't get much better. Moderately priced. Lunch for 2 was $22."}
{"text":"I eat there often and the food is stellar and the service is awesome. Fast and friendly with great specials and home cooked food.  The gumbo is the best in the valley as far as I'm concerned and the BBQ beef sandwich is amazing. Great salads as well. Five stars in my book."}
