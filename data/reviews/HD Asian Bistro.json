{"text":"I'm not sure how this place gets 4 stars. It's probably unfair of me to give a bad review on only one visit, but I won't be back to try it a second time. From the lunch menu, I ordered the chicken with vegetables, which comes with a spring roll and soup. I also had fried rice as a side. I opted for the egg drop soup, which had a tinny taste reminiscent of the can it most likely came out of. The spring roll was ok, but the rest of the food was utterly bland. I tried giving it a good douse of soy sauce to liven it up, but it still just fell flat. The fried rice didn't taste freshly made, although there's no real way to know for sure if it was. It wasn't awful, but I've had Asian food at other restaurants that was SO much more flavorful and satisfying. At the end of the day, the only word I could use to describe my lunch today is \"meh\"."}
{"text":"I reviewed this place last November but I found that review was under the old name even though it had changed when I visited....Here is my review. I take the time to do this because it was SO disappointing, most of our food ended up in the trash.

From December of 2015 when I was in town after visiting family for Thanksgiving...

Placed an order at about 4:30 for a 6:00 pick-up, should have taken the fact that they were out of snow peas as a sign. Got to the location and the place was NOT here, but Asian Bistro was, called the number and they indeed were the same place. Would have been good info for them to share when I phoned my order in. (We are from Wisconsin) My husband runs in to pick it up and they say that they don't have an order for our phone number. He gets back in the car, I call and start rattling off my order that she has told me repeatedly does not exist and then recites my order (that I didn't get a chance finish giving her) back to me, oh yes, we do have an order from you, I'm told. But you already picked it up I'm told....ummmm, no, we didn't, and it's a pretty big order, hard for someone else to likely walk off with. So she says they can make it....so I think what a great opportunity to pen a review, so as I sit in my car.....here it is, my review. .....We'll see how the food is. 
Update: so they were kind enough to give us a 20% discount on our order. Get home and dig in. Spring rolls were ok, crisp, not too greasy but nothing special. I was told the egg rolls were ok (I don't eat pork and they do not have any other non-pork options) I ordered a shrimp dish, beef dish and a chicken dish, none of it was great. Runny, and even after a full pouch of soy sauce my portion was still bland. The dishes were flavorless. The veggies didn't seem that fresh and after all the holiday leftovers I was just really looking for some good Chinese. Don't look here if your after the same thing as I was."}
{"text":"Dined here Friday evening.  We had delicious meals and quality was past where chef H came from.  Think they are still trying to iron out odds and ends of start up but a little advertising will bring crowds to this little restaurant. Extensive menu and priced very well.  Happy Hour 3 to 6...didn't know it until bill brought to us and wine and beer half price during this time frame.  Everyone friendly and happy.  Glad they are in Fountain Hills."}
{"text":"In our opinion this is the best Chinese takeout in town!! While we do love dining in also it is nice to have hot fresh food delivered in a timely manner right to the house and this place hits its mark! Some of the best Chinese and being from the Bay Area we have tried a lot of different places. We enjoy the Mango Shrimp, Lemongrass Soup, Pineapple Fried Rice & all the standard dishes we have tried. Very fresh and always such great customer service! Thanks again!"}
{"text":"We dined here last night.  What a great surprise.  The place is attractive, the food was excellent with wonderful service.  We will be back for sure."}
{"text":"Wish I could give no stars! Worst place ever don't say you have a buffet and there is never any food on it! Then when you bring out one tray 10 people mob it. Thanks for not serving me any food!! Now I guess I'll have to go to a fast food joint!"}
{"text":"Everyone is right there eggrolls are horrible and if that many people are saying that their eggrolls are bad they should really read think where they get their eggrolls from or how they make them. Barbecue ribs were gray with some kind of sweet soy sauce on them. I ate 4 and tossed the other two out. Wonton soup was good although I think they were chicken wontons and not pork. There were lots of vegetables mixed in to the soup. General Tso's Chicken was very good and there was a lot of it. I will definitely be there again"}
{"text":"We went for dinner and we ordered a less spicy small Mongolian beef and regular chicken egg foo young. Although we are accustomed to chicken in an egg foo young patty, we received the patties covered with a delicious chicken vegetable dish. Both were very good. Even the small order of Mongolian beef was a nice portion.
Unfortunately, service was lacking as only one of the owners were there trying to take phone orders, host and wait on customers. Surprised that there was an extra $1 for Brown rice.

The food is worth going back and hopefully service will be better. They have a lunch buffet
during the week."}
{"text":"At first I was a little annoyed  My first order I wanted Fried Rice instead of brown $1 extra or white, but there is no option. Even though I noted it, they did not call or change it as a courtesy. Knowing it was my FIRST order. But he explained to pick Brown rice $1 extra and then they could sub for fried rice. 
I've now ordered 7-8 times for DELIVERY, and the food is excellent. I like everything I've tried. The POTSTICKERS being my absolute favorite. They get my order right every time and it gets here fast (when it says it will) and hot!! The honey walnut shrimp is delish as well. Go to place in FH when you don't want to drive anywhere or cook."}
{"text":"Best Chinese place I have ever been! The owner is so sweet and makes sure we always have a good meal. The cooks are so sweet also! They been doing this for years, and you can tell they love what they do. This is a regular place now for me and my boyfriend!! Can't wait to come back!! Thank you Asian Bistro!!"}
{"text":"The two times we've ordered here whether it was through Grub Eats or picked up our food, it's been the same, not so great. We've ordered Mongolian beef, kung pao chicken, fried rice, wontons...and it's not tasty and comes in very small portions. As a frequent traveler to Southeast Asia and living in Vegas (where we have a proper Chinatown) I understand and appreciate good quality Chinese food, this place isn't that place.

For a $50 dinner tab as we have been averaging here, the food is nothing special, just basic."}
{"text":"I stopped for lunch and had the buffet.  It was adequate.  Most of the vegetable dishes were overcooked."}
{"text":"Yes , I can agree. Just an OK place for Chinese food. Everything else was closed on Fathers Day evening. The staff were nice, they forgot to add eating utensils. I came in for pickup and had pre-paid a 20% tip because I thought they would deliver to my work place less than 1 mile away. I could not tell which one of my orders was orange chicken or honey chicken? they were similar. I ordered shrimp and scallops. Chef Gordan Ramsay would have bleeep, bleep, I was happy to have had some scallops at that point. The peppers in this dish were generous, and crunchy, a delight . I would only order from there again if i were 3 sheets to the wind drunk and nothing else was open."}
{"text":"We've eaten here before so we thought we'd try their delv service. We ordered through the \"Beyond Menu\" app & shortly after we ordered we received a call from Beyond Menu asking if we'd received our food, which we hadn't. That was the beginning of a 2+ hour ordeal just hoping to get our food, which we never did.  I called the restaurant 2 times and spoke to a man who could barely speak English and apparently couldn't understand English at all. All he said was they were busy and our food was being made! It's a shame that we received such horrible service and I had to leave this review because the food was actually pretty good (from what we could remember from our first visit) I'm not sure where the problem was but I can assure you we won't be using the app OR this restaurant again."}
{"text":"When ordering a to go order hope you don't get the older lady to take it.  0 for 3 on my orders and don't even think about Grub Hub.  They won't even start cooking it until you call them to ask the status of your order. I live .5miles from there and it took an 1:45 to get my food.
Foods not bad but them taking orders over the phone is go at your own risk"}
{"text":"We had the buffet. It was nothing to write home about, unfortunately. 

The reason I'm writing this is because of one of the buffet items in particular. The fish. 

The fish on the buffet was a rubbery inedible mess.  That's it. Rubbery. 

Most of the buffet items were about what you'd expect from an Asian buffet but I also have to point out the orange chicken.  The few pieces of orange chicken in the pan were so old they were stuck to it. Really stuck to it. 

The hot and sour soup was neither hot nor sour. And the mini egg rolls were lacking in flavor as were the sauces. 

Saving graces were a layered coffee cake in the deserts that was really tasty and the friendliness of the staff. 

Next time I'll try ordering off the menu. I hope that those items will have bolder flavors and that I can find something spicy!!"}
{"text":"Ordered on a whim upon our arrival at Inn at Eagle Mountain.....DELICIOUS!!!

Ordered on GrubHub - they even called because they noticed we were at a hotel to see if we'd like plates & silverware!! So nice!

Super Fast & courteous delivery!

Amazing coconut shrimp (best, home-made, real coconut breading!!) & crab rangoons. Some of the best egg foo young I've ever had - the gravy was super!! Shrimp & lobster sauce so yummy!!

We're here for 3 weeks & I plan on ordering again!!"}
{"text":"Finally a good Chinese restaurant in Fountain Hills!  We ordered on line after phoning a zillion times and getting a busy signal.  The food was promptly delivered hot and delicious.  Hubby had Kung Pao Chicken and I had Cashew chicken, good safe choices for our first experience.  The small portion is a good dinner size but you won't have any leftovers. 

Delivery bag included all of the needed sauces and chips. 

Quite enjoyable!"}
{"text":"This was excellent! Fresh flavorful and reasonable. Our second time and we will continue to return. A wonderful addition to Fountain Hills!"}
{"text":"Tasty food and very polite service. I walked to Asian Bistro to pick up takeout and was very thirsty when I arrived. They got me water while I waited for my food. The food was very good and well-priced. Plenty of leftovers. The spring rolls were delicious."}
{"text":"So disappointed!  Ordered through Yelp and arrived 20min later to find my order had not been sent to the kitchen.  Waited another 40 min for my take out.  We ordered the Korean spring rolls, they were good enough but the peanut sauce was terrible!  Lots of ginger and vinegar and watery to the point I don't think it was even peanut sauce.  My wife had the Pho with beef.  Lots of bland beef but very few veggies.  I had the Generals Chicken.  Lots of chicken but the absolute WORST Generals Chicken I ever had!  Their ability to achieve a combination of extreme salt and total lack of flavor was actually quite surprising.  I ate a few bites and gave up, the trash got the rest.  The Pineapple fried rice was ok and I ate a few bites but still could not get the salt taste out of my mouth.  So disappointed!   Thank goodness Hao has good Asian food in FH!"}
{"text":"Good food and good service. We went on a week day - Monday - at around 7:30 and he place was empty. We were a party of 6. 

Everything we ordered was OK, nothing to me was outstanding. The prices are considered relatively high in comparison to the quality of the food. Honestly, I've had better quality for a lower price in the valley. We ordered many main dishes and for appetizers we ordered the crab cakes or wantons, not sure what they were called any more but honestly, although it tasted good, it was all cream cheese, no crab! 

The food came out in a good amount of time but my husband's order and mine were just warm, not something I think is considered ok when you're eating at a restaurant, right? The white rice was also mushy and sticky, almost sushi like!

At the end of the meal, we were offered free ice cream from the ice cream machine. A very nice gesture from the owners but the ice cream tastes mostly like ice rather than a creamy soft ice cream cone. 

Would I go there again? Maybe, if I'm in the area and I'm starving and craving Chinese food immediately but I wouldn't head to Fountain Hills specifically to eat there."}
{"text":"A little disappointed in the food. Pretty bland even when ordered extra spicy. About the equivalent of a Panda Express."}
{"text":"We ordered delivery through the online app and that was cool and worked well.  Food was delivered on time and hot.  We ordered egg rolls which were okay. Nothing great.  The general Tso's chicken was good and my wife had Kung poa shrimp which she said was kinda bland.  Overall good, not great experience.   Maybe better if we eat in."}
{"text":"I love this place. There egg roles are to die for. Other food is great. Plus they have a cute bar. That's all I need.  Good place to stop into and enjoy."}
{"text":"We go here with some frequency to dine in. The folks there are so pleasant and nice. But what's better is they deliver locally. It's wonderful to get the real deal great Chinese food to your door. Tonight's delivery was exactly as ordered, hot, fresh and delicious!"}
{"text":"We almost always pick up food from Chens Garden when we have a hankering for Chinese food but my husband had heard good things about this new place and wanted to try it. The ordering system is online and you can see pictures of what you are ordering so I give that part five stars. Easy to order and prepay and even leave the tip if you prefer not to tip in cash.   The portions were large and the sauces were plentiful. The food was very good. The only negative was the crab puffs.  They barely had anything in them and there was a lot of excess crispy dough. Which is the reason I took off one star.  Other than the crab puffs I highly recommend this take out.   The potstickers and accompanying sauce are really good so go with those over the crab puffs."}
{"text":"Ordered take out from here on NYE. It was quite tasty. I usually think of fried rice as fried rice. No big deal but they use BIG shrimp and it was very light tasting. So good!  The only thing I wasn't a fan of was the egg rolls. Overall I thought it was great and I would try this place again without hesitation."}
{"text":"Do yourself a favor and do not go here. Unfortunately, it's the only Chinese buffet in Fountain Hills. I have visited this restaurant 3X around 1pm after the lunch rush. Each of the visits the buffet was sparse at best. Staff took their time bringing out options. On my most current and last visit the buffet was extremely sparse. The host assured me that more food would be available in a few minutes so I had a spoonful of dry rice and 2 dry chicken wings. 15 minutes later and still no additional food on the buffet. I decided to leave and they gave me a 25% discount on the minimal food I ate. Needless to say, I won't be back."}
{"text":"We ordered through their website and received food at our door in Fountain Hills in about 20 minutes. The food was fresh, hot, and delicious - the vegetables were crunchy and the shrimp was not overcooked. We gave it a 4/5 because the Kung Pao wasn't spicy for our taste and because of the lack of variety of vegetables which were primarily red and green bell peppers and onions.  Their ordering portal (BeyondMenu.com) was one of the easiest, most well-done sites I've ever used. I can think of a lot of companies that could use their help! One thing we didn't see when ordering on Beyond was a description of each menu item. We'll definitely order again."}
{"text":"Just had a chance to try out their new dinner buffet. Similar to lunch except they have added an excellent baked fish and outstanding muscles on the half shell with a  cheese topping. Great value!"}
{"text":"I honestly hate to have to say a negative thing about a place I was absolutely CRAZY about, less than a year ago.
Due to the somewhat limited choices of restaurants in Fountain Hills, I am a 3-4 times a month dine in/take out person on average, however this place was the exception to the rule. I was eating here an average of 6 times a month. As well as telling everyone I knew they had to eat there because it was by far the best Chinese in town.
One thing I should point out however is that this restaurant used to be called Pacific Moon, and believe it was different owners then.
Unfortunately not only the name changed, and as a result I am a once every 2-3 months HD Bistro customer.
I'm leaving 3 stars because of the extremely nice staff (including the owners) and pretty fair prices. 
If the HDB owners should read this; I apologize for the somewhat negative review, and would love nothing more than to leave you a 5 star review like I used to do with every person I spoke to about Pacific Moon.

Just as with any review, I would recommend trying it for yourself. It is still the place I go to for Chinese in Fountain Hills, just not anywhere close to as much as I used to : ("}
{"text":"We chose to take out our dinner. Mongolian beef and lemon chicken. Dinner choices were both delicious, packed well and reasonably priced according to today's norm. Will do this again sometime soon. HD Asian on Palisades is the place to go in Fountain Hills for this type of food. They have new owners and a great chef."}
{"text":"If your looking for a Chinese buffet thats reasonably priced and not gonna make you sick this place is always a sqfe option. Not the best Chinese in the world but certainly do-able and affordable for large quantities of food."}
{"text":"Five of us had dinner for the first time here. All of us agreed the food and service were outstanding.  Beef & Broccoli, Shrimp & Veggies, Curry Chicken, Cashew Chicken, Orange Chicken, Won Ton soup, Egg Rolls, and vegetable fried rice were all delicious. Ice cream and a fortune cookie completed our meals. And the owners made sure our dining experience was exceptional every step of the way. We'll definitely be back.   
They also offer take-out and delivery."}
{"text":"This restraunt has been through the ringer and has bounced back victoriously. Not saying it was bad in the beginning, but it is sooo much better now! I am not sure of why the  name change but better now"}
{"text":"This was our first order from HD Asian Bistro and we had the food delivered.  The ordering was easy and the delivery prompt, but we were very disappointed in the food. We ordered Lo Mein with Chicken and Mongolian Beef. The Lo Mein with Chicken had very little flavor. It was bland at best. The Mongolian Beef was only slightly  better, but not something we would order again. We will try another Chinese restaurant next time."}
{"text":"A okay place for some quick Chinese food - Just a okay needed more flavor a little bland but they do not use any msg and lots of their items are soy free.  The lunch specials are only $5.99 which comes with entree, soup, rice, hot tea and egg or spring roll.  Lots of food for the price.  Wish it was more flavorful though."}
{"text":"We have ordered out and visited this establishment and have been happy every time. The food is delicious, delivery is quick and customer service is excellent!"}
{"text":"I live in fountain hills and just discovered this restaurant. I've tried them twice in less than a week and this time was just as disappointing as the first. I kept it simple to feel out the style of their food... first time had it delivered. Order the crab puffs which were nothing but flavorless cream cheese paste inside undercooked dough not a piece of crab in them...spring rolls also under cooked and chicken fried rice which actually had big chucks of chicken in it yet wasn't anything special past the amount and size of chicken in it. All of our food arrived cold which is really bad since I am literally two blocks from them door to door! This time I decided to pick it up in hopes our food would be hot... nope again barely warm and I sat there waiting on it to be completed!We reordered the chicken fried rice knowing it was at least eatable and again the best item out of the three... my son ordered teriyaki chicken and we were give sesame chicken, it was gross didn't eat it... the egg roll was standard grocery store quality could have been cooked longer hence the doughy bites at each end. when I called to inform them they gave us the wrong food only to be issued a credit I doubt I'll ever use! The restaurant was empty at 7 at night.. our experience there and after taking a look at the buffet that contained a limited array of food that obviously had been sitting for hours, it was dried up and absolutely not feasible to serve its more than obvious why there was no one in there!! A couple walked in wanting the buffet while I was waiting for my order, looked at it cancelled their drink order and left!!! The manager who was on his phone texting behind the cashier counter didn't even try to get them to stay! Bad the whole way round!I think I'll stick with the chicken fried rice to use up the credit than forget this place exists!"}
{"text":"very nice lunch buffet. also convenient delivery available. i love pepper steak and shrimp dish."}
{"text":"Love the food here. My favorite is the Mongolian beef! So good!!  Favorite Chinese food that I've found since moving to Arizona"}
{"text":"It's funny because the 2 years we lived in Fountain Hills we tried all of the Chinese food FH had to offer, but HD Asian Bistro was the only one that came close to our favorite place we would occasionally go to in Phoenix. About 2 weeks before we left FH I finally tried the \"Singapore rice noodles\" and I fell in love. TWO WEEKS BEFORE WE MOVED OUT OF FH. I had been searching for great Singapore rice noodles for years. But... let me get to the review part. 

Always wonderful service. Plenty of options. Never too busy. Free ice cream at dinner. I love their little \"chips\" for an appetizer. Singapore rice noodles and general tso's chicken is great! My husband always enjoyed his meal. This is the best Chinese food in Fountain Hills, by far."}
{"text":"Love this place! Great food, excellent service! So happy we tried it! Will return vey soon!!!"}
{"text":"Glad to see they have their own spot here on Yelp now.  I almost reviewed them under the old ownership's name because that still came up when I checked in.  Although I loved the food and former owner, I have to say that this is a very pleasant change.

The new menu is delicious!  I especially loved the walnut shrimp.  We have been in a few times since the change over and the food and service are wonderful.  We no longer feel the need to travel to Scottsdale for great Asian food.  The owners are very accommodating and willing to answer our questions and offer suggestions.

I am looking forward to trying the pho when the temps dip below 115 degrees.  If you haven't been in yet or lately give them a try."}
{"text":"this Asian restaurant is one of the few in the town of fountain hills. tucked away in a little plaza, Asian Bistro, is a quiet little restuarant with a nice staff. usually not busy they offer your typical spectrum of Asian dishes - teriyaki chicken steamed rice beef and broccoli lo mein, etc, free refills, and it even has an ice cream. I don't drink, but if memory serves me correctly I believe they have a bar and serve alcohol. so for some Asian cuisine in town i would look no further."}
{"text":"Wonton Soup and shrimp thin rice noodles were so perfect! They have so many different noodle options! This will be our go to from now on."}
