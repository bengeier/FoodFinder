{"text":"Good food and interesting menu.. fried green beans to chicago deep dish pizza .. refreshing menu items. I ordered the steak wedgie.. was so large could of fed a family of three.  Fresh cut fries... yes please.  I saved the best for last... the menu offers new style pizza by the slice yet!  The slice of cheese new york style pizza was my favorite part of today folks!!  I will be returning to try other menu items."}
{"text":"Best thin crust pizza I've had in the Pittsburgh area. I've tried a lot of places. This is the closest thing to east coast pizza."}
{"text":"Have ordered delivery twice. First pizza was very good. Thin, crispy crust with very good ratio of cheese and toppings. Second pie was not so good. Too much cheese and meat made the crust soggy. Also, the pizza was not cut completely. Also ordered an Italian hoagie which was disappointing. Nice roll. Way too much ham, in thick slices. The ratio of ham to cheese and other meat was 70-30. Thin sliced ham tastes better on sandwiches."}
