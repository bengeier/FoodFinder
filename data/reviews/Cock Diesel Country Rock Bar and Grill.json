{"text":"Terrific food and exceptional service!   Beautiful decor and a fun energy!   We are coming back after our movie to party here.   Great addition to the \"vanilla' restaurants out here.   Anxious to see them in night club mode!"}
{"text":"I don't know about their food or service, but I was here at night and it was a lot of fun! For how busy it was, the bartenders kept up and poured generously, and I had a pretty good time. No real complaints in the nightlife area."}
{"text":"Couldn't possibly suck more and looks like it has closed before it can steal any more money from its clientele.

This place sucks so hard I actually worried it may pull the earth off its axis. I'd love to spend the next hour stomping a mud hole in this crap bar's ass and walking it dry, but it is so lame/pathetic it doesn't even justify that effort.

There are few places where you eat and get up to leave and think.....I would rather get kicked in the nuts by a Budweiser Clydesdale than ever step foot in here again."}
{"text":"The bar has a nice set up for watching games, but my wife and I went there for lunch after a movie next door. It was not that crowded and it took about 40 minutes to get our burnt burger and fries. Neither came how we ordered it was not seasoned either. Very disappointed. I am sure if we were ordering beer  and appetizers our review would be much different. Not a good place to go for a meal."}
{"text":"OMG!!  So salad sucked but they offered to sub for something else!  Shaved turkey club with sweet potato tots!  Incredible!!  So good!  Love this place!  Katie is awesome!"}
{"text":"Wasn't sure how it started but LO our waitress took great care of us with both drinks and food.  Food was great, try the Hog wings, fantastic! Then we had some sliders also great. Lively atmosphere and just getting started, live band coming on and sure to be some dancing... Great night!"}
{"text":"Went there for drinks and apps to find out that they have no liquor (nor license for it) which was disappointing since it's the \"new place\" in town. Won't be going back."}
{"text":"I was visiting from California and was excited to go to this \"hot new\" bar.  It has a lot of potential but poor service and bad attitudes of the bartenders will be its downfall.

The drinks were weak, and the bartenders were either inexperienced or were not trained properly.

No smiles at all and I actually saw people leaving the bar without paying.  That right there shows they are not aware of what they are serving and should be charging.

The A/C was inconsistent very hot at the back where the tables are.  No servers came to our table at all even though we had a clear view of all of them chatting it up or on their phones in the back. So we were forced to go to the bar.

Will not be going back."}
{"text":"Oh my god this place sucks, my boyfriend and I sat there and boo'd about how lame it was. The staff is rude, with no sense of humor. I mean my god I serve tables and I promise it's not that bad.

This location has been about 5 different bars in the past 10 years, no one can seem to stay. It's a shame because the building is huge and has a loft area with a patio. Oh well!"}
