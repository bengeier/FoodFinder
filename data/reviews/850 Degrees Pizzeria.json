{"text":"On a Wednesday night, the restaurant was about half full so no wait needed for a table. The staff was great. 

Got a free delicious garlic bread with a Yelp check in. 

The small personal pizza is about 9-10 inches. 

Really like the simple minimalist decor."}
{"text":"We got the free garlic bread with a Yelp check in (which we wouldn't have ordered otherwise) and it was amazing!! We also got the rocket, the David Bolland, and the superman pizzas as well as the chorizo and rapini ravioli. They were all amazing but the one of us who ordered the pasta said the pizzas were so exceptional to any other we've tried that he wished he'd gotten one instead (not that the pasta wasn't amazing in its own right). The best of the 3 we ordered was the superman - the dough and tomato sauce were some of the best we've ever had and the olives, pepperoni and fior di latte cheese were incredible. We even got an extra one as takeout to satisfy the craving we knew we were gonna have the next day. We live in Oakville but we'd travel to long branch any time for 850 degrees delicious zas!"}
{"text":"Amazing place. Will visit again. Great food and good atmosphere. Happy to have stumbled on the place."}
{"text":"The mushroom salad was great as was the pizza. Good service. We plan to go back to try more dishes."}
{"text":"Could not try any pizza, reservation needed on sat night, 1.30 min wait time. Glad we dint waste our time waiting for a table. We found another pizza place down the street"}
{"text":"I amazed as to how this place is rated so highly. After looking up Yelp reviews and been close to where we live, wifey and I decided to try this place. The food is mediocre at best. Have had way better pizza and pasta at a fraction of the price. Ordered the 'Shinny' pizza (wild mushrroms) and this was a disaster, soggy, could see water on the pie, mushrooms were not fresh seemed like they used canned mushrooms. Wife ordered pasta al forno, no flavours at all its like eating raw tomato sauce. We hardly had two bites and had to waste the entire dish. Still don't why this place is rated so highly. Anyways this is my 2 cents on this place."}
{"text":"We were a group of three who had to get in and out.  Got seated promptly.  Server was friendly and attentive, despite taking care of a bunch of tables and at the end, split the bill for us, no sweat.  The antipasto was a hit: lots of variety, everything tasted fresh: cheese, meat, olives, roasted veggies and the bread was piping hot and drizzled in garlic oil, yum yum yum.  We shared the M'ikmaq, the Canuck (avec hot peppers), and the Long Branch.  All of them were devoured, but our pick would have to be the Canuck for the kick.  We were stuffed and still couldn't resist the Tiramisu, which disappeared in two minutes; we think there was mascarpone in the icing.  And Louis Armstrong to serenade us!"}
{"text":"Great think crust pizza here!  Love their tomato sauce. Like the relaxed and open dining area.  However, we also order for pick up!  I have never been disappointed."}
{"text":"I love the pizza here. You can not go wrong with fresh ingredient and smart flavour combinations."}
{"text":"We have always had a 5 star experience at 850 and have dinner there about once per month. I decided to hold my 30th birthday dinner at the restaurant and we booked for about 25 people. From the time that we called to make the reservation (about 1-2 weeks in advance) to throughout the evening, right up until we payed and left we were treated by staff who were very friendly and accommodating. The food was as always, tasty, fresh and quickly prepared and was complimented by many of the people we had joining us that night. I also have to note that the space they gave us was great and we were all very comfortable while we ate. I'm really happy that I got to celebrate my birthday with my family and friends and such a wonderful restaurant and would highly recommend it to anyone. My favourite pizza is the Long Branch and we always get the polenta appetizer. We love that this gem of a restaurant is in our neighbourhood!! Thanks to everyone at 850!"}
{"text":"Finally got around to visiting this pizza place near where we live. I was NOT disappointed!  Beautiful interior,  nice open kitchen,  friendly service and really super yummy pizzas. We ordered the group of 7 and the shinny w peperoni. I cant wait to go back and try more. Thanks for coming to the lakeshore 850'!"}
{"text":"If you're looking for a good little pizza joint, come here!

The place is nice and clean inside. The waitress that we had was absolutely great, super friendly and efficient. We made reservations online, which I would highly recommend doing. The pizza was really good. I would definitely recommend this place if you're in the mood for pizza."}
{"text":"Great homemade style pizza. Plenty of variety for the family. Pastas and desserts were also very good. Service is friendly and prompt. Highly recommend for a casual night out."}
{"text":"Great service! The owner is always there and super attentive, making sure customers are satisfied. Pizza here is affordable and delicious! It taste truly Italian. The one with arugula and prosciutto is a must try, my favourite!"}
{"text":"I've had 850 Degrees in the past and it's always tasted very good although the toppings are very skimpy but I eat here because it's the only gluten free place nearby. This time around it was a bit minimally excessive. Our gluten free pizza (as seen in the photo I posted) had so little tomato sauce that towards the edge it was so thin it was dried out and the edges were almost 2 inch thick with no sauce or toppings at all. It was a pepperoni pizza with extra artichokes. The artichokes were just single leaves which left no artichoke taste, as it was just crisped artichoke leaves. Maybe they should supply a free dipping sauce for all that extra crust. The crust itself is very good. 

Needless to say, I will not be returning here again. Too many lackluster experiences for the price. It's also quite expensive! $19 for one 12\" pizza with one extra topping. There's more and more places serving gluten free pizzas and there's no excuses."}
{"text":"My family and I had the Lord Stanley (artichoke,roasted peppers and mushrooms) without ham and vegan cheese.  Love,love the dough with the daiya cheese and toppings.  Also, THANK YOU YELP FOR THE FREE GARLIC BREAD!!  I will be back.  Very friendly staff,kid friendly and I loved watching the pizzas being made in the wood oven so close to our seats.  We arrived for our reservations at 7pm on a Thursday and the restaurant was busy but not packed."}
{"text":"Came here a few weeks ago and used the Yelp check-in special for a free garlic bread!  It was super delicious, we ordered a cheese version as well.  I was with a group of friends and we all had individual pizzas.  A few of us had the \"Rocket\" which was super delicious, you could tell the proscuitto was really nice quality.  One of us had the \"David Bolland\" and wow, the salami on it was super hot! Service was good and I really want to try some of the others options on the menu.  This is a great pizza place in Etobicoke when you want some really good quality pizza and I will definately be back!"}
{"text":"Excellent pizza! Just picked up . Service is very friendly and fast ,the place is charming, and the pizza is like what I remember from pizzerias in Italy and France . Love it. Can't wait to come over for a sit down dinner"}
{"text":"A nice casual place to grab some 'za. There is a good variety of pizzas and some decent craft beers to suit most tastes. The food was good for the most part: the crust was a bit too thick and a little chewy for my liking. Service was quick and friendly. Overall, it was a thoroughly enjoyable experience.

Tip: ask for the chilli oil and drip some on your pizza."}
{"text":"I would say 3.5 stars.
I was there with a larger group for lunch.  The service was nice and we each had a pizza, which were very tasty! 

My only criticism is the desserts.  My friend and I ordered the apple and pear crumble and it was really disappointing.  It was essentially warm pieces of apple and pear tossed in cinnamon with cream on top in a small ramakin with no sign of a crumble - not worth $5 IMO.
Not the way we wanted to finish of lunch."}
{"text":"Great new spot on Lakeshore with friendly service. Pizza was excellent with nice crust and great artisan toppings. Also really enjoyed the mushroom salad and the tiramisu for dessert was among the best I have had for a while. Will definitely be coming back!"}
{"text":"I was pretty stoked when I heard we were coming here for a dinner party. However, I was totally unsatisfied. The pizza in my opinion is overrated. I guess I had higher expectations. And I did try 3 different pizzas from others at the table. One was cold too. I was going to complain but didn't want to make a big fuss in front of gfs family. Anyways, customer service was excellent, but I thought they were trying too hard, especially for what it was. I definitely wouldn't be coming here again, but that's just me. Because I don't recommend this place for myself, doesn't mean I wouldn't recommend this place for someone else."}
{"text":"Great pizza place. Wide selection of thin crust pizza. Quick service. Try the Lord Stanley"}
{"text":"I didn't want to write a review for 850°.  I really didn't.

On the advice of friends, we checked this place out last year. What a find!  We've been a few times now and the reluctance to review was purely selfish. We didn't want it to become too popular and cause us to have to wait for a table. 

Last week, You Gotta Eat Here aired and featured 850°.  We saw the episode and thought 'here we go! It'll be impossible to get in now.' So, we popped in on Monday this week, later in the evening. Thanks to it being a rainy Monday night, there were plenty of tables. 

First off, love the funky, relaxed decor. Second, the service is always top notch. Our server was fantastic - attentive, knowledgeable, and very friendly.

Then there's the food. Admittedly, we stick to pizza and wine. Every pizza we've tried has been incredible. Some of the best Neapolitan style crust and sauce we've had. Fresh,  mostly local toppings, and the Canadian themes are inspired. We don't have a favourite, we have about 6!

On top of this, their Ontario wine selection is perfect. Where else can you get a couple of perfect (in our humble opinion) pizzas and a bottle of wine for $60-$70? 

Great addition to the south Etobicoke neighbourhood!!

Update: loved it so much that 8 of us are going here this Saturday afternoon. Introducing a bunch of friends to 850!"}
{"text":"I'm so lucky to have this fantastic little pizza joint in my neighbourhood! Tonight my BF and I finally checked this place out. The restaurant is small and they've crammed too many tables in which means that guests get seated uncomfortably close to each other and its hard for staff and guests to move around without knocking into things. We had the garlic bread, which is like a pizza crust with garlic butter on it, the David Bolland pizza and the Muskoka pizza. The pizza crust here is made with a special type of flour and baked in a stone oven. It is thin in the centre with a nice soft crust. So good. The Muskoka is a white pizza with a great sauce, mozzarella, rapini and a tragically skimpy amount of bison sausage. My BF was pretty disappointed with the lack of meat on his pizza. I had the David Bolland which was just excellent. The tomato sauce is amazing; not too heavy and really fresh tasting. It has mozzarella and tons of delicious, spicy calabrese salami. I'm definitely going to need to come back to try some of the other pizzas and the deserts."}
{"text":"It's not one thing that makes 850 Degrees so enjoyable; it really is the sum of so many good things. 
*The pizza menu: interesting without being flash or freaky, 2 or 3 vegetarian options, locally sourced ingredients. 
*The pizza: chewy, slightly charred crust (good!); just enough toppings to be tasty without going to gooey.
*Beer and wines (no spirits): carefully chosen mostly locals (only local beers) and a few cool rotating ones (REALLY liked the Great Lakes Brewing Thrust! IPA)
*Serving staff: engaging, knowledgeable, friendly, attentive
*Tuesday evening acoustic music
If you're staying around the airport (like we were) and are frustrated by the many chains and mediocre restaurants, 850 Degrees is an easy 15 minute drive. And well worth it!"}
{"text":"Not sure why all the stars. Pies weren't good enough for a return visit. Staff were great but they were absolutely slammed."}
{"text":"Love this place! Also love that its within walking distance to my house. Amazing pizza, fair prices, uses local ingredients where possible, and local beers and drinks! What more can you ask for?
They also have live music some nights. The decor is slightly industrial and its a smaller, more intimate restaurant.
I usually go with the small Rocket pizza, its delicious. As far as drinks, they're always changing the offerings so I try to have something new each time. They also have specials for pizzas and drinks every month or so."}
{"text":"I've been a fan of the west end for many years and this place is the new staple of Lakeshore! Incredible atmosphere and the service went above and beyond. The food was spectacular, fresh ingredients and arguably was the best pizza I've had in the city. Stop where you're going and be sure to check this place out!"}
{"text":"Cozy little spot with friendly staff and great service.  Their gluten free pizza crust is delicious!"}
{"text":"Was taken there for the first time on my birthday. Had the Muskoka pizza. Fantastic. Great Lil spot with both patio and inside seating. Very welcoming staff and attentive.

Fully recommend and will certainly return."}
{"text":"I had the spicy pizza, forgot the name but it was delicious. 5/5 for the food but 4/5 for the service because the waitress kept telling me not to rush or no rush even though I wasn't rushing lol. Like she gave me the bills and says no rush, like do I look like I'm rushing? Chilll....
Anyways highly recommend the place! I probably would go again next week!"}
{"text":"My second time going to this moderately sized pizza place on Lakeshore. I hadn't been in a couple years so I decided to check it out to see if my memories weren't failing me. My past experience was not that different, except that this time was even better. A memorable night for me, I enjoyed every minute I spent here. Our waitress was fantastic and always there when we needed her, well deserving of a tip. The vibe of the restaurant is one that is not only cozy but also happy. From the minute I walked in I saw that everyone seated had a smile on their face. The pizza is cooked at the back left of the restaurant and our meal was prepared very quickly. You could tell that the kitchen staff care about what kind of food you're eating & how your overall experience is. I ate the Fort York pizza which had four different cheeses, and as a fan of trying different cheeses I really enjoyed what it had to offer. One of the best wood oven pizza joints I've been to, with a price point well worth it for the food quality as well as the service, I'd recommend it to anyone looking for a nice dinner at a fantastic price."}
{"text":"I think there's crack in the caesar salad. It's really good. Good craft brew selection.   Sat on the sidewalk patio and didn't smell any car exhaust. Wasn't sure what to expect with that. Red Rocket is my go to pizza."}
{"text":"Never disappointed with this place. Amazing thin crust pizza with premium toppings. Group of 7 and long branch are my favourite and despite always feeling like there is no way I could finish a whole serving, I usually do. Great craft beer selection also. Can't go wrong."}
{"text":"Free garlic bread upon checking in through Yelp? I love this place! It's a great place for Humber students to eat when on a long break. The waitresses are always super nice and friendly (they even remember us as regulars)! The 2 friends that I go with agree that their sauce is amazing and the crust is perfect. The small size pizza is a great size and fills you up. Their garlic bread is so different from typical garlic bread and I LOVE it. Yum. 

I like the decor and its a nice family spot as well. I wish they offered lunch specials such as a small salad and half a small pizza! The waitress said they were in the process of coming up with some so I look forward to that. I will 100% keep coming back."}
{"text":"Really enjoyed our dinner here, ordered a pizza from the conventional menu and the pasta of the month which was gnocchi. Loved the items on the menu of the month in general. To keep it short, loved the service, the ambience and food. Would definitely come back whenever I'm around."}
{"text":"3.5*

I really wanted to absolutely love this place. I recently moved to the Lakeshore area and when I heard there was a real deal pizza place down the road, I was more than ecstatic. It's a beautiful bright space that fits well with the Lakeshore vibe. Cool tables and chairs, as well as friendly staff that kept my friend and I comfortable until we were seated. The menu is straight forward and not incredibly lengthy, which is always a plus. The beer selection is local which is fantastic and it's a welcome change from the typical big name brands. We started off with the polenta appetizer which was fantastic and the portion was more than enough. We then had the polpette (meatballs), which were honestly borderline awful. Five little ping pong sized meatballs literally drowned in a bowl of tomato sauce (watery tomato sauce at that). I can honestly say they were some of the worst meatballs I have ever had. They were so hard and so tough that it was almost like they cooked they to oblivion, or they forgot some sort of soaked bread or breadcrumbs when they made them. The amount of tomato sauce in this bowl was enough for a soup. The bread that came with it was fantastic, but it wasn't the fluffy loaf style bread that would be fantastic for dipping. The waitress noted that they may have been gluten free.... Really? Meatballs are quite possibly one of the easiest things to make and I couldn't believe how bad these were.

The pizzas were quite good. I had the wild boar and rapini pizza. The dough is fantastic and it probably is one of the best doughs I've ever had. However, I really did feel like the combination of wild boar and rapini lacked something extra. Since there was no sauce, etc. , it really needed either some goat cheese to bring it together, or something sharp such as Pecorino (or even some spice). Either way, the dough was great, the combination not so much. The other pizza that my friend had was quite good and had tomatoes and I believe olives. 

Overall, It was good. The meatballs need to be fixed and I will return to test them out in a few weeks to see if they've improved."}
{"text":"We tried their monthly specials for pasta and pizza few months ago. Both were tasted pretty good but I thought the pasta was bit overpriced because of the small portion size. What I enjoyed the most was their appetizer antipasto plate and their local beers!

Great place to go on a date if you are in the neighbourhood!"}
{"text":"One of the hidden gems of the lakeshore scene 
Excellent crust and fresh ingredients combine for a wonderful meal 
David Bolland and Superman pizza ordered 
Will definitely be back again!"}
{"text":"So happy to have this in the hood. It's early days for them so want to give a fair assessment. I've been only once and tried only a few pies. They were good!  Hard to describe the crust. It's not a thin, crispy one nor thick and doughy but a nice middle ground. Airy and chewy in a good way. You can tell a different flour is used and it is successful. Toppings are fresh and local and hold up well. However with an 850 degree oven I feel they should be able to get a crisper crust that can hold its own with moist toppings such as their group of 7, which was great on first slice but quickly got a bit wet in the middle. Service was friendly and efficient.  If I could make one big suggestion?Assess the lighting situation and ambience. My guest commented it felt a bit like a hospital cafeteria. It is stark and not cozy feeling. the barn board on the one wall is really nice and would be great throughout to help soften the space. The pizzas are good and leftovers heat up nice and crispy on a panini press.  Welcome to the neighborhood 850."}
{"text":"850 is one of the best pizza places around. It's definetely a must try place. I would highly recommend reservations as it looks like the secret is out. Great job Chris and all the staff!"}
{"text":"Dinner here was phenomenal!!!  Super attentive and friendly service, cozy and quaint atmosphere, and most of all, absolutely delicious food!  We ordered the Lord Stanley and it was to die for!  It was very tasty and fresh, and the bonus is that everything is locally sourced!  Great beer selection, and everything was very reasonably priced!  Would definitely come back!  Make reservations in advance as it's a small restaurant and gets packed!  Vegetarians also have lots of good options!! :)"}
{"text":"Start to finish 850 was on point. 

This is a great joint to check out if you want good Italian style pizza but don't want to travel all the downtown. Located in the quaint neighbourhood of long branch this joint brings all the \"downtown\" quality without the travelling headache! 

We were greeted promptly when we entered the restaurant, we chose to sit on the patio because it was a beautiful evening. The patio albeit noisy because it's located next to the street, was still quite comfy. You could tell this patio is only installed when there is good weather.

The service was also really good. There was a switch between servers at the beginning of our meal, but we preferred the girl who switched on so it worked for us! She seemed knowledgable and very friendly and laid back. 

The food... Amazing pizza, the choices were endless, the crust was perfection. The right thickness, the right chewiness and the right crispiness. 

I also loved the Canadian theme for naming of the pizzas. This theme was also found between all the products they carried. 
From the pear cider we had to the whiskey in our coke. 

Overall, a really good local pizza joint. Check it out when you have an opportunity."}
{"text":"Fantastic meal!  Great atmosphere too!  What a vibrant place. We had the Oh Canada pizza - the egg was a new twist to an old favourite.  We'll be back."}
{"text":"They dish out amazing authentic Italian pizza. It is located near the long branch go-train station. Street parking is available aplenty. We went around 4 pm, so it was neither time for lunch nor dinner; but the restaurant was full. 

- Great tasting and flavorful pizza
- Nice beer selection
- Attentive service
- Fair prices

I'll definitely keep coming for more and more. Wish we lived closer to them."}
{"text":"Really enjoy out takeout pizzas, had 3 12\" pizzas for 4 of us but would order 4 next time as it was so good we all said we could have eaten a whole one! Loved the Muskoka, the Superman and the Rocket!"}
{"text":"The service was wonderful right from the start. It almost had to be since we were the only ones there - the restaurant was empty. 

When checking in via the Yelp app, we discovered that they offered free garlic bread. We had no problem redeeming the deal.

I then decided to order the \"Lord Stanley\" which included Ham, fresh mushrooms, artichokes, roasted peppers, parmesan cheese, fior di latte cheese and tomato sauce. I would of loved to see more artichokes, however it was a delicious pizza that I had no problem devouring. 

Along with their amazing menu, they offer a great selection of local and imported beers to wash it all down. 

850 Degrees Pizzeria was a unique and casual dining experience."}
{"text":"As of writing this, I've been twice. The pasta and pizza were great both times and I really enjoy the pomegranate soda they offer. You need to be a fan of thin-crust pizzas, but the quality is right up there with some great pizza I was eating along the mediterranean when I lived in Europe."}
{"text":"Beef ravioli is amazing and the pizza is always great. Good service , foot and wine selections"}
{"text":"Great lunch time experience all around, not really anything I could complain about. Located in the Long branch neighbourhood of Etobicoke (literally half a block from the Mississauga/Toronto border), it's a fun, modern, and surprisingly Canadian wood fired pizza joint. I say surprisingly Canadian because of their pizza menu utilizing classic ingredients fused with a little canadian flair both with ingredients and in name.

Our server was wonderful, patient, very sweet and was a joy to speak with (I believe it was Chantel?)

My pizza, was amazing, I had the one with fresh pepperoni, olives and spinach. I can't recall the name but it was amazing (maybe Superman?!?!?)

They have my fave brew \"Canuck\" by Great Lakes Brewery in a can, so that made my Pizza and Beer splurge experience even more enjoyable!. 

AND... with yelp check-in you get a garlic bread style pizza, for FREE!

Great fresh ingredients, perfectly cooked pizzas, and fab service. Can't go wrong with this joint!

{"text":"Love it. Staff was great,
 food is delicious, 
atmosphere is pretty nice,
Kids running around but hey 
love watchin them play :)"}
{"text":"Despite reviews of skimpy toppings, there were lots of toppings on our pizzas and we were happy and full. Arrived at Noon on a Sunday - plenty of seating still available. Our waitress was so nice and came to check up on us a number of times (filled our water jug, filled our glasses, offered plates for sharing) and made easygoing conversation with us. 

We ordered:
- Muskoka pizza: didn't try but was told. It was good
- BC pizza: super tasty; I like tuna, anchovies, and capers though
- Shinny pizza: few types of mushrooms but not bursting with taste - I added chilli oil
- Pasta Forno: house made pasta and they're generous with the sauce! 
Garlic bread - free when you check in. Yum!"}
{"text":"I am glad this pizzeria opened near my place - I was surprised to find myself in front of a delicious pizza with extremely fresh ingredients, I had the \"Oh, Canada\" pizza and it was cooked to perfection.

We went some days after the opening and the service was great - friendly staff and environment. Can't wait to go back and try more of their pizzas -
 they also offer pasta and salad options but the pizza is obviously their focus. The menu was extensive and I saw some very original combinations in there that I definitely wanna try!"}
{"text":"This was very good.  The pizza was quick and the salad was very fresh.  It's a more Italian authentic style pizza than American Italian.  Great fun atmosphere for the area."}
{"text":"This spot was on the radar thanks to the good word spread by super CM Kris U.  With a long shopping trip at CostCo followed by a draining stop at IKEA I was ready for my dinner here. Made a reservation via Open table which somehow didn't reach em but since it was a weekday and we were kinda late we were seated immediately. 
For starters we got the freebie of garlic bread thanks to the check in offer. Good indication on the quality of the dough as it was quite good. For the mains we went for St. John's (margherita) and group of seven sans the olives pizza.
Wine list is OK and is all Canadian wines (read you need to order a white here) wasn't in the mood for a beer though the limited beer selection looked interesting. 
On to the pizza the dough itself is decent though I wish it was cooked little bit longer or at higher temp as it did have a slightly soggy feel. The tomato sauce base on St John had bit of acidic finish the group of 7 had decent toppings. 
I would say 3 stars for the pizza. Kudos for the service here as we were checked on consistently and the staff was all smiles."}
{"text":"Delicious pizza's.   The crust is baked to the point it is still doughy tasty and crispy.   Ingredients taste like they were all picked that morning.   Beer selection is phenomenonal to compliment the pizza.   Try the PALENTA app.... Very good.   Love this place in the neighbourhood."}
{"text":"I was going to wait for a second visit before leaving a review but I had to rescue the reputation of the arugula pizza (The Rocket). I just had it and it was fantastic. Wonderful fresh ingredients, airy flavourful thin crust, loads of yummy prosciutto = everything I could have hoped for. I also had one of the featured beers and enjoyed that; I'm looking forward to their wine and beer tasting events. Service was friendly, helpful and efficient. I appreciate that the restaurant has a nothing-to-hide open kitchen. Overall a great first experience. 

As another person indicates there are other wood burning ovens in the neighborhood. I'm very excited to have one closer to where I live and would say that, based on my first experience, this one is at least as good as one (though 850 beats them on menu creativity), and far superior to the other. I will definitely be back and bring  friends.

Only one small negative. I think that a restaurant with such fresh creative food should have a fresh creative soundtrack in the background. The existing music stream was a poor match for the sophistication of the menu. But that's small potatoes. And easily changed. And maybe I'm just a fussbudget.

Welcome to the neighbourhood 850 degrees!"}
{"text":"Delicious every time!  We always come for the Pizzas, but this time we had the Garlic Bread, which was good and we tried 2 of the desserts; also good.  The Tiramisu and Apple Pear crumble weren't too sweet and they were the perfect ending to a fantastic meal.  Staff has always been great, very attentive and friendly.  Cannot wait to come back!"}
{"text":"I'll begin with stating my inherent bias towards thin crust pizza, which is what led me to this place on a busy Friday night. We managed to snag a table within 15 minutes and our server was over pretty quickly.

They had a 6.50 beer special which was to get rid of their stock, I presume (Flying Monkey was one of them), so that was a nice start. We ordered the antipasto (14.95) which can best be described as a stack of delicious items. You could probably eat that and be on your way, but we still went with individual pizzas (Rocket for me, Shinny for my man). The toppings and flavour were delicious on both, but I honestly felt that mine wasn't quite cooked enough. The crust was a bit too soft still so it made picking up the slice without toppings falling off nearly impossible.

I also got the tiramisu which was a reasonable portion and quite delicious!

Our server was Danielle, and she was super quick and friendly. They had a small menu for kids, too.

I would still come back, even if just for the anti pasto platter!"}
{"text":"What a great place .... if you haven't tried this little gem you must do it soon. Sooooo hard to find a quality homemade pizza place in the GTA, this is it. The lovely Sabrina and Jen kept me and my friend entertained and gave some great suggestions. This place rocks, great pizza, great staff, clean and nice vibe for dates or families."}
{"text":"Ordered Long Branch Pizza last evening picked it up.  Found not much goat cheese on pizza and crust soggy..Was disappointed because i have had a good one before.   Guess they have lost me."}
{"text":"How do I put this nicely:  holy effing crap. This place continues to amaze me. Their pizza is awesome, their garlic bread and appetisers are so good and fresh, and the service is so friendly and just the right amount of interaction.  They are there when you need them, gone when you don't. 

The pizzas are a very good size and have amazing flavour combinations. There's something for everyone, lots of vegetarian options, and great stuff for kids. 

Their beer selection is fantastic, and the beers pair really nicely with their pizzas. 

I have nothing bad to say about this place, except that there aren't more locations. Please open more locations. Please."}
{"text":"Hands down the best pizza place in Etobicoke. The ingredients are fresh and locally sourced and the menu caters to everybody; meat lovers and vegetarians. I personally love ordering the \"pizza of the month\". It is always unique from the regular menu and it uses ingredients that are in season so you know it's fresh!"}
{"text":"Ordered the \"David Bolland\": Fav. pizza of our man from Mimico consisting of Calabrese salami, fior di latte cheese & tomato sauce.  And \"BC\": Beautiful BC. Home of the sustainable Canadian Albacore Tuna: caught in the pristine waters of the North Pacific.  Made with albacore tuna, onions,capers, anchovies, Kalamata olives & tomato sauce."}
{"text":"850 degrees is a pizza resto that is situated on the lakeshore. Have been here many times but never had the chance to review! They specialize in wood-oven pizza and have many choices to choose from! Everytime we come, we tend to try a veggie pizza and a meat one. This time, we came for our fiance's birthday and had a group of 12 so the variety was definitely a lot more than what we are usually use to as just the two of us. 

For starters, we had their ceaser salad and caprese. The large caprese salad had about 9 slices of tomato and mozzerella. It was tasty, but wished they put more mozzerella ontop! A slight drizzle of honey ontop would also be tasty! Ceaser salad was standard and was an ok size for Large. Large could feed 3 people comfortably. 

In terms of pizza, our favourites were the mushroom and the hot sopressta one. The crust were cooked to perfection, very crispy and did not make the centre of the pizza soggy. They are also quite generous with their toppings. One pizza is definitely filling for one individual! The Hot sopressta one is extremly delicious when it is just out of the oven - pipping hot! 

Pricing wise is a little bit pricier - ranges from 13 - 15$ a pizza.. It is also thin crust base. Overall, great experience with good servers! They also have monthly specials so that's also cool to try if you get a chance. Not a super huge restaurant though so make sure to make a reservation if you're going with a large group!"}
{"text":"My friend who lives just down the street had recommended I come here after I had told him about Pizza e Pazzi.  The location for this restaurant is in Mimico near Lakeshore and 30th street just east of Long Branch.

There is some parking along the south side of Lakeshore and although there are meters you don't have to pay after 6pm.

I had made a reservation for 850 just today around lunch time by using Yelp's reservation option on the business page it self.  I was pretty much immediately emailed a confirmation for the table.

We had arrived literally right on time and I immediately noticed the restaurant was packed.  They had a countertop along the storefront windows where people could sit and one of them was actually occupied but the person sitting there wasn't dining, just seemed as if she was waiting.

I was greeted immediately and mentioned I had a reservation and there was a table waiting for us near the front of the restaurant.  The place was definitely hopping and it was rather loud inside because of it.  There was music playing in the background as well and for the most part I really had a hard time speaking to my wife just across the table.

For what it's worth the table for two that we had I found was a challenge for what we order and what eventually was coming.

Upon checking in I received a free garlic bread notification which my server noticed on my phone and said she would be bringing it right away.  She also brought a decanter of water with lemon.

The menu is your paper placemat.  I find that rather efficient and it saves the servers time not having to give them to us and then eventually take them away.  They do however have a long card with the drink menu and desserts.  The non alcoholic drinks are on the same side of the card as the desserts while the beer and wine choices are on the other.  I had started off with a Canuck Pale Ale.  The server went to the trouble to tell me that it was a very bold and hoppy beer and I assured her that I knew what I was getting into.  The beer was fantastic.  It was made in Toronto and came in a tall can.  

We had ordered the Antipasto as our appetizer.  I was shocked to see how much food came on the antipasto which was priced at only 10 dollars.  It came with another garlic bread (same as we received for checking in) along with a long plate of mixed mushrooms, artichoke, roasted peppers, 2 different cheeses, olives, eggplant, rapini, soppressata, and prosciutto.  This appetizer could literally have been a meal on its own since it was such a large serving.

For the mains I had ordered the Muskoka which was a mozzarella, rapini and boar sausage.  My wife had ordered the BC which was without cheese but had red sauce, onions, capers, kalamata olives, albacore tuna and anchovies.  

By the time the pizzas came we had to make room because as I had mentioned the table was kind of small for what we ordered.  We had to reorganize the plates around so we had room for the decanter of water, my beer, my wife's drink the left over garlic bread and some of the antipasto which I had moved off the long plate.

The pizza I had ordered was fantastic.  Rapini and any sort of pork is just a magical combo and their sausage was really unique and went very well with rapini.  The BC however my wife found it to be quite salty.  I had a piece of hers and I while I liked it I could see how she could think it was salty.  Between the capers, olives and anchovies there were definitely pockets where it was really salty.  I happened to like it but I would have to say the pizza could do without the anchovy or olives but not necessarily both if I had to pick something to come off.  I love anchovy by the way.

The dough for the pizza is sort of thin in the middle but does get thicker towards the edges.  I liked the quality over all but I have to say if I had to pick which place is better (between 850 and Pizza e Pazzi) I would still have to go with PeP.  850 though for not being an official Neapolitan establishment makes an awesome product.  This place has a very Canadian spin on a pizza and is amazingly good all around.  

The service was great.  Our server was on top of everything and was very professional and super polite.  I would love to try some of the other pizzas that I didn't get to try tonight like the bacon and egg one (Oh Canada) as well as their 4 cheese (Old York).

While we were both full my wife still felt like having a cannoli.  I had some of it and I did like it considering I hardly ever eat dessert.  She had a latte and I ordered a limonata.

The prices are very good as well for the quality and quantity we received.

I know we are going back here since my wife liked it... sold..."}
{"text":"great and fun place! always accommodating and the pizza is delicious! i've never tried anything else on the menu but it all looks delicious! ya would definitely recommend! The pizza names pay tribute to famous canadian places and faces- and the waiters are knowledgeable and can make customisations."}
{"text":"If you want delicious wood oven pizza, come here.
We went here with a large group for my brother's birthday. Even though they are a small restaurant they were able to accommodate.  We ordered the Superman pizza and the wild mushroom salad, both were filling and enough for two people. They were delicious with fresh ingredients. They also served complimentary garlic bread if you check in which is a perfect starter. This is more of a quick dine in restaurant with minimal parking available so make sure you come early before the dinner rush starts."}
{"text":"Moved to the area recently from downtown...this place hits the spot. Have only done take out but the pies hit the mark! Really recommend... and looks like the restaurant has a solid beer selection. Bonus!"}
{"text":"I know, I know...everyone RAVES about this place but I don't find it that good...sorry! The pizza is ok, I've had both better and worse, the staff is super friendly but it doesn't make up for the lack of amazing food. Such good potential but not really that exciting to eat. Pizza had lots of burn marks on the bottom but was really limp/soggy in the middle."}
{"text":"Wow 
Una de las mejores pizzas que he comido!!!
Me encanto la pizza del mes 
Muy recomendable"}
{"text":"A solid 5 out of 5. Ordered the group of 7 pizza and the David Bolland pizza. Both were delicious!! We also got cannoli, apple & pear crumble and cheesecake. All were amazing. This was probably the best restaurant pizza I have ever had. I saw some other tables had ordered pasta and it looked incredible. I think I will try it next time. The decor was very cute and the atmosphere was cozy. The restaurant was pretty busy and they actually had to turn people away - it seemed like we had arrived just in time."}
{"text":"My daughter wanted to check this place out after seeing it on the Food Network Show, \"You Gotta Eat Here!\"

So to celebrate her acceptance in to University we made the trek.  

Tip #1
Parking is tight in front of the store.  You may have better luck seeking free parking on a side street near by. 

Tip #2
Consider making a reservation.  The table space is limited and if you are with a group of 4+ people it is better to book a table

Tip #3
Use Yelp! App to get a free garlic bread

So we arrive and order the antipasto.  Very good but next time we will try the cheese tray.  The assorted pickled veggies, cheese and meats were a good starter.  

Next we ordered three pizzas.  I ordered the 5 Cheese and added salami.  Very good.  

My wife ordered the Dave Bolan.  Excellent pizza with a hint of spice.  

My daughter ordered their pepperoni pizza.  She loved hers.  

Sadly we had to leave in a rush so we didn't try the desserts.  Next"}
{"text":"Saw the high yelp rating and decided to stop here for a bite. Better to make a reservation as we came without one and got the window seats facing outside, their only remaining option for the night. But it was comfortable unlike those normally high stools with your feet hanging.

Waitress was very friendly and came around more than a few times.

Check in for a free garlic butter bread, it was quite good, could do with a tad more garlic flavour.

Now the 'za was amazing. Would recommend the salmon arugula one on a cheese base (named M'ikmaq). Ultra thin crust with interesting toppings.

One star deducted because at first the dessert menu seemed too inexpensive, until the apple pear crumble came out and was just slightly bigger than the size of the spoon. It was still tasty, although missing the concept of the \"crumble\" part, however you'd better not share and best order your own."}
{"text":"Pizza Please!!!

I came here with three other people on a random Thursday for dinner.  There was no wait and we did not have reservations.  They had inside and outside seating.  We choose to sit outside in their front patio area.  

Once seated, waters were given to us and drink orders were taken.  We started with their complementary garlic bread from Yelp's check-in.  The garlic bread looked like flat bread with some garlic and olive oil.  We were not offered their spicy olive oil so we had to ask.  I thought it was decent.  I like that the bread came out hot but it lacked in flavor.   For dinner, we shared their Mozzarella & Tomato Salad, a Lord Stanley Pizza and their Pizza of the Month.  The Mozzarella & Tomato Salad was pretty simple but all the ingredients tasted fresh and delicious.  We got a large size and it was more than enough to be share amongst us four.  It consisted of sliced fresh tomatos, basil and fresh mozzarella.  The Lord Standley pizza had ham, mozzarella and other cheeses, artichoke, roasted peppers, and tomato sauce.  I thought it was decent.  The Pizza of the Month (July 2017) consisted of tomatoes, cheeses, pepperoni, bacon and fresh mushroom.  It was spicy but good.  

All pizzas range from $13-$15 and are shareable for 2-3 people.  I thought pricing was reasonable.  Didn't think it was super amazing but didn't think it was horrible.  The food took forever to come out.  Our waitress finally came out and admitted that the computer lost our order.  So... our order had to be retaken so more waiting.  The inside of the place is a decent size.  The outdoor seating faces the street so you can people watch."}
{"text":"This place is very popular in my neighbourhood so I decided to give it a try. First of all, you must make a reservation- especially for dinner. It's a very family- friendly place and I like that. The wine selection is ok, nothing exciting. The pizzas all sounded interesting but the taste wasn't all that great."}
{"text":"I've been going here since it opened and it has always been awesome! Best part is the sauce. I never thought sauce made a difference, but this is homemade and so flavorful. Nice staff and nice set up too. 

Make sure you get pizza though. The other menu items are just OK. I can see why some people have had 3/5 experience if all you have had is the pasta etc."}
{"text":"I tried the chorizo pasta here for take-out and really enjoyed it. I went to go into the restaurant this time around and ordered the Ravioli with braised beef and my friend ordered the Penne with meatballs. 

The ambiance of the restaurant was very warm and inviting. It had an intimate feel but the tables were spread out far enough that it felt comfortable and not too crowded. They had high chairs in the back for children.

The ravioli braised beef was tasty and not too tough. The pasta itself was also cooked just right. The only thing I didn't like was that they put way too much pasta sauce.

My friend's penne seemed a bit too chewy but everything else tasted great! 

Would love to come back and try the pizzas or any of the appetizers."}
{"text":"Five stars to NICK the waiter!!! I am vegan and asked my usual 50 questions  about the ingredients. He was amazing. He even called someone to ask if the pasta has egg in it (it does). 
Nick was friendly, helpful and the best waiter I have had in a long time. The pizza was incredible! I ordered the StJohn's with vegan cheese and sundried tomatoes. The pizza is huge so i have leftovers and am certainly not complaining 
Great lunch, excellent waiter. Nuff said."}
{"text":"Plus:
-Price point is reasonable
-Friendly Staff
-Food is B to b+
-Tiramisu was divine, store made, creamy, the best I ever had

Minus:
-I had the pane pasta with meatball: very lackluster, meatball was flavorless and hard
-the pizza was good.  I had better but it was certainly above average to good

Verdict:  Worth the try, but don't expect too much, but at the price point that it is offered I have to say it is good value and worth recommendation."}
{"text":"Stumbled upon this place quite by accident, needing to urgently feed my son, before an appointment next door. 

And what a pleasant accident it was - this place has absolutely excellent pizza, with a wonderful, soft crust. 

Adding to the taste is the interior - quite cozy. 

A definite repeat when I'm next in the area."}
{"text":"Went here before we went to see star wars. Was looking forward to it since they have great practices for locally and humanely sourced ingredients plus hello pizza!

We started out with their meat balls and buffalo mozzarella salad. 

The meat balls have been commented before about being dry so rly thpught they would have changed their recipe but my bf said they were dry still. Disappointing. 

The free pizza bread was good except they charged us for it accidentally. 

We had the famous five and added the beef pepporoni for my bf, i found it delicious but poorly cut and the bf had a few pieces that the crust was prerty burnt. The pizza also said it jad blue cheese but honestly was no where to be found. When i asked they said theres more mozzarella so its not tasteable... whats the point then??? 

The tiramisu was delicious and melt in your mouth and they offered us a comp coffee. 

The servuce was great and there was great live music on a tuesday night!

Would go back but just think they could be near perfect if they tweak a couple of things. 

The beer list and wine offerings were also good!"}
{"text":"So I am in Toronto for a quick meeting. Very low expectations for dinner as we are outside the city proper. But my Yelper community lead me to 850 Degrees ... 

I was starving, so I went for the polpetti al forno. 5 beautiful meatballs in a bright and flavorful sauce accompanied by a hot, fresh Italian focaccia dripping with butter and garlic ... please!  Is all this flavor necessary?

My pizza was recommended by the wait staff. I went with the \"David Bolland\" ... Calabrese salami, fior de latte cheese and tomato sauce. It sounds pretty straightforward, but it is not. The crust was beyond perfect ... slight char, slightly chewy, and crispy where it should be ... a perfect pizza. 

I really wish I had taken a picture, but it was just too damn good. 

I can not recommend this place enough. 

Also, they had a guy playing a great guitar and singing in the restaurant when I was there ... \"She talks to angels ...\"

Great place!!!!!!"}
{"text":"Was a great experience. The beer selection was great. They give you a free jug of water with lemon, lime and basil in it.  I tried two items a 8.5\" pizza Muskoka, which was a bit burned on the one part but the rest was mouth watering and the Beef Ravioli, which great handmade Ravioli and the beef on the inside was moist and cooked perfectly."}
{"text":"Great little place.

Ended up here right before closing last night with my brother looking for something to eat.

Since we happened here super late we were told we had take out as our only option. Totally cool seeing as we got there five minutes before their posted closing time. The place was super cute and very clean.

I ordered the Canuck pizza, free garlic bread (thanks Yelp for the check in offer!), a side salad, and the pasta al poppette (spelling?).

Everything was really delicious! Loved the homemade pepperoni on the pizza. The salad was simple and could have been a bit more fresh (this is my only complaint and cause of one star demerit lol) and the house made dressing served with the greens was so good (basically like a creamy garlic - yum!). The pasta was awesome, the sauce and the meatballs were great. Garlic bread was also super tasty!

Make sure to try the cray unfiltered pomegranate ginger ale from Bruce Cost if you are a ginger person, it is awesome!

Definitely looking forward to return for dine in next time!"}
{"text":"850 presents different concepts, yet quite acceptable and flawless. Everything is nice and quite edible however doesn't hit the spot and give you that euphoric feeling. Making love without reaching to its climax."}
{"text":"Excellent pasta, pizza and dessert place! Highly recommend the tiramisu, cheesecake and cappuccino as well. The February pasta of the month was fantastic! Any chance you can make it a permanent fixture on the menu?"}
{"text":"We decided to drop by at 5:00 on a Saturday for early lunch. By 6pm, the restaurant was pretty packed, so make sure to make reservations for dinner! 

For 2 people, we ordered Bloor by the Park, and a garlic bread. The bread was super tasty and came in a pretty big portion! 

I would definitely go back to try the other pizzas. 

Food: Bloor by the Park 5/5 
Ambience : very lively, though could be quite loud as its not a large space 4/5
Service: waitress serving us was super friendly and kept checking up on us 5/5"}
{"text":"As an update to response from 850 Degrees.  As I appreciate the response and the offer of refund.  After checking the credit card statement.  The refund has not shown up in the account.  Please follow up when you can.  Until then, I feel it appropriate to maintain the rating as so."}
{"text":"A really nice place with more than just pizza. The main event is the pizza, of course, and it doesn't disappoint. The various combinations work well together (I'm fond of the \"Group of 7\") and they're nice about making substitutions. I haven't tried all the appetizers but the polenta one is very tasty!

The service is exceptionally friendly and attentive and it looks like they plan to have special events and live music from time to time, which is something to look forward to. 

My only suggestion is that the tables could be bigger. Not a lot of room to manoeuvre when you've got a couple of pizzas, glasses, water, flower vase, side plates, and so on."}
{"text":"Grabbed some take out from here, the Canuck and the Group of 7 pizza's.....average pizza, a bit too saucy, a bit too pricey....nice interior and friendly service."}
{"text":"My wife and I have been anxiously awaiting opening day here and I'm sad to say that our experience was a little disappointing. We went in knowing they'd only been open four days and was prepared to cut them slack because of that. 
With that said, there were quite a few things that need improvement, especially because there are other well established fire baked pizzerias not that far away.

We ordered an arugula and prosciutto pizza and a cheese board. The cheese board was a nice selection of cheese for $12. There were 5 kinds of cheese, bread, and a dab of jam. The cheese was good but the bread was just extra thick pizza dough, which wouldn't necessarily be bad except that it's a pizza joint where you're probably going to be ordering pizza and would like to have something a little different than more pizza dough. When we ordered the cheese board appetizer, we already knew which pizza we wanted so we ordered that too. The problem was our pizza came out first, then the cheese five minutes later. 
The pizza was a disappointment. There was very little sauce. I mean, very little. The prosciutto tasted ok but was way too mild for all the strong arugula piled on.  Also, the prosciutto was laid out in strips out from the center, which was fine, however the pizza was sliced so the number of prosciutto didn't match the number of slices of pizza so you had to cut and reassemble the ingredients in order to get a taste of everything on each slice. 
Our server asked us if we'd like more bread with the cheese and we said yes please. The bread was quickly brought out hot, freshly baked from the oven. After a few bites we realized that the bread wasn't cooked all the way through and had a thin doughy strip right through the center.
I really wanted to like this place considering we live so close but there were just too many things that need improvement. Hopefully, if we decide to give this another try in 6 months they'll have fixed some of the problems."}
{"text":"Have been to 850 on a number of occasions and each time it is fantastic. Last night was no different. There were 4 of us and we started with a battle of Cabernet Franc. The other couple shared the M'ikmaq pizza ( Marinated smoked Salmon, arugula, capers, Fior di latte cheese) they loved it! My wife had the Famous Five pizza (Smoked Ontario blue cheese, asparagus, Cremini mushrooms, red onions & Fior di latte); another win. And I had the Grand River (Spicy calabrese salami ,local  ham, wild boar sausage, pork pepperoni , Niagara prosciutto fior dil latte cheese & tomato sauce). This was spicy enough to have me perspiring and hitting the ice water  over and over. I like spicy so this was very enjoyable. Some may find it a bit too much for them. I bowed out on desert but my wife saved most of her pizza for later and enjoyed the cheese cake. Our diner guests shared the Apple & Pear crumble. And we all finished off with cappacinos. We all agreed the food was all fantastic. 
We also found our waitress very friendly and quick to serve our wine, replenish the ice water and bring our food. Service was flawless.
To top it all off, we had a great live performer singing some wonderful hit songs. 
All of the full tables seemed to be really enjoying their evening. 
We can't wait to return."}
{"text":"I love it here! Delicious salads, good wine, and I even tried their gluten free pizza which was delicious. I would highly recommend this has become one of my go tos."}
{"text":"The service is amazing! We get the same waitress every time and I adore her! She is sweet and so attentive! I also love love love the food! I am not a fan of thick crust, which makes this pizza even better! I get the same one every time, and I can't get enough of this place! If your looking for a good place to eat, 850 is the place to go!"}
{"text":"This place is a family favourite! Great food, patio and high chair! I've had the gluten free pizza, ravioli and salads and all were fantastic. Would definitely recommend and go back!"}
{"text":"We go here a lot....great place for a casual dinner. Bonus points for being very kid-friendly. Love the garlic bread and salads and the pizza dough. Pizza sauce could definitely use more oomph, but I just ask for garlic on my pizza to take care of that. Would also like to see more veggie & cheese pizzas on the list (i.e. ricotta & spinach/kale)"}
{"text":"Solid pizza joint in a really cute part of the city. Came for a reunion with a bunch of friends for a casual dinner, and we were not disappointed. Service was friendly and fast, parking was busy, but accessible. The appetizers we ordered - sliced zucchini and the pizza bread - were splendid. The pizzas themselves were alright - I enjoyed the crust, but the flavour combinations sounded better on paper than in reality. We ordered the BC, the special (some meaty boar pizza) and the Shinny, a mushroomy pizza. The sauce tasted homogenously tomatoey, with varying levels of spiciness. The toppings were sprinkled on top sparingly and were okay, but something just seemed to be missing...more cheese? Don't get me wrong - decent! But I've had better."}
{"text":"Nice addition to west end.  I felt the prices were 'high', tried the Group of 7 and the Canuck, bit too drippy/over sauced.  For a return visit would ask for well done, the crust is nice, but could use a few more minutes in the oven.  Friendly staff."}
{"text":"Well I finally came here as the rave for this spot continues !!
There was 8 of us in the group and everyone got a different Pizza , so I thought let me try a Pasta dish I got the chorizo stuffed ravioli .
Well that was a mistake . Stick with the pizza cause the pizza here is Fantastic !!!!! I'm serious the pizza is worth coming for ! I wish I didn't get the pasta as I wasn't a fan at all and Neither was anyone in our party who tried the dish .
HOWEVER ....the waitress was very nice and took Care of the situation for me and offered to get me something else . Excellent service ! 
So in the end the Service  is great , the staff is very friendly and nice , the Pizza is Fantastic !!! Actually that's an understatement it's amazing !!! the atmosphere is nice , and modern ! Check them out for sure !"}

I normally don't like veggie pizza but the ingredients make it worthwhile. I'm new to the area but this is definitely my new regular pizza place :)"}
{"text":"Had the Canuck was awesome! definetly got the the pizza / stringy melted cheese fix :)"}
{"text":"The pizza from 850 is delicious! My friend and I came here on a Friday night and happily did not have to wait for a table. The menu is straight forward with pizza, pasta and appetizers. The accompanying drink menu has about the same number of options as the menu.

I had 'the Shinny' a mix of tomato sauce, cheese, and wild mushrooms. The light, thin crust allows the flavours of the toppings to take centre stage.

The next highlight for me was dessert. A soft cheesecake with a melt in your mouth honey crumble. Top that with fresh strawberries and you'll be craving more.

Servers are friendly, attentive and know their menu. The atmosphere is casual albeit slightly noisy. Good for groups of 2 to 22.

Definitely a nice addition to Bloor West."}
{"text":"Based on the great reviews we thought we'd give this place a shot. We were there at off hours between lunch and dinner. When we walked into the restaurant all we could smell was bleach so on to the patio we went. 

Ordered the Shinny and Long Brach pizzas. We also received the free garlic bread cause we had heckled in to the Yelp app. Unfortunately our food came before the garlic bread as we were told the kitchen 'burnt it' the first time around, which I do not think is true. 

Regardless - onto the pizza's. 

The Shinny - combination or wild and fresh mushrooms. Unfortunately as mushrooms retain a lot of water, the mushrooms leaked their juices making the pizza soggy. 

The Long Branch - this pizza was also quite soggy. 

Both pizzas tasted ok, meaning the flavours were there but the texture was missing. They were not as crispy as expected and was a bit let down. 

We got the 2 smaller sized pizzas and the price, with the free garlic bread came to $20 which was fair. 

There are definitely better pizza joints so unfortunately I won't be returning here."}
{"text":"This is my favorite pizza restaurant in Etobicoke.  The food and service is fantastic. We come for dinner on a weekly basis. Katie or Chantel are gracious servers. The beer menu is well represented with local micro brews.  Tuesday night there is usually live music, but not too loud. The pizza is thin crust and absolutely delish."}
{"text":"My first time here was about over a year ago... my not boyfriend at the time planned my birthday celebration here.

The interior was to die for I love the old farm look.

From what I could remember, the service was amazing. The staff were all friendly, outgoing and ready to serve. A friend also left her item behind and they called us to let us know to come back and pick it up. Unreal. Most establishments would have just tossed the item in the trash.

The food was delicious and they named most of their pizzas after hockey slangs/terms and players. Everything is made from food in the local area."}
{"text":"LOVE this place. Recently spent a relaxing 4 hour lunch catching up with my brother here. 

We ordered two pizzas:

 Shinny
Wild Mushrooms, Fior Di Latte Cheese & Tomato Sauce
$13.50 with extra salami and 

Group Of 7
Goat Cheese, Fresh Tomatoes, Spinach, Roasted red Peppers, Black Olives, Parmesan Cheese & Fior Di Latte Cheese
$14.50 / $8.50 with pepperoni to try those home made meat specialities. 

Well worth trying. The pizzas are ready really quickly in their hot oven which is why it has place has this dumb name of 850 - that's the temperature of the oven. 

They have a very small Pizzeria on their blue awning but otherwise, it's hard to decipher what the storefront is about. Well, at least for me it was. 

White wine was delicious too and they had big carafes of water. Will be back soon."}
{"text":"How do I give it a 4 1/2 star :).  Family booked a Saturday lunch.  Location convenient for all.  
We made the booking based on favorable YELP reference.  We really wanted brunch but as we were meeting afternoon and all voted for pizza.
What a great find.  I have some picky eaters in the family and when I first saw the on-line menu I was concerned some might balk.
Should have not been concerned.  The unique pizza menu is perfectly delivered by great preparation and toppings.  Flavors blended together but complimented one another.  Party of five we ordered 4 unique pizzas and all were great.  The ambiance was good - but it was lunch time and place not crowded.  Noisiest table was ours.  The room is very pleasant.  We had great service.  We stayed too long and did not get in trouble.  Without a doubt would recommend to anyone for a fine pizza experience. As well it was so good I am looking forward to trying both appetizers and pasta.  Thanks Yelp for the recommendations, thanks 850 for the great day"}
{"text":"Embarrassingly, my husband and I have had pizza 5 times this week so we know pizza and 850% is the king.  

We ordered the Near the Park (or named something similar) and the salad named after their restaurant, both were amazing.    

Things we loved; Ontario produce, Ontario meats, Ontario cheeses, great Ontario wines (something I never thought I would say) and spectacular service from our friendly and patient server named Danielle.  We ate the left over pizza for breakfast this am and it heated up incredibly well.   Their crust is our favourite within the city, crispy, yet chewy, yet light - deliciousness all around.  

Although they have cool ceiling lights and a decent sound track, I still found something about it a little cafeteria-ish.   I was hesitant about sharing the latter comment bc I don't actually have any suggestions on how to improve the ambiance.   This is not a date place unless you are old and long married like us

We will definitely be back"}
{"text":"This was another instance where I had to check this place out due to its appearance on an episode of You Gotta Eat Here. (John Catucci is a national treasure.)

Given that, we had to order the two pizzas the Catooch ate: The Oh Canada and the Muskoka.

Sad to say, however, that the two pies were just okay. The Oh Canada (maple bacon, egg, fior di latte cheese & tomato sauce) suffered from a palpable lack of toppings, as they were so sparingly applied I had to wonder if perhaps the chef was running low. And the egg in the center was overcooked, thus depriving us of that delicious, runny yolk that should have been the highlight. The Muskoka (wild boar sausage, rapini & fior di latte cheese) didn't fare much better, since the rapini left big portions of the pizza unpleasantly moist. (I guess the cook forgot to dry them off after rinsing them?) The sausage was decent but again far too sparse.

All in all a somewhat disappointing experience, particularly coming so close to my visit to the much, much better Son of a Peach. (Now those guys make a 'za worth getting excited about.)"}
{"text":"Ordered the Group of 7 and BC for pick up. Service was 5 stars on it's own; fast and very friendly. Absolutely loved my Group of 7 (the goat cheese was heavenly) and husband really enjoyed his BC (although he felt that olives, capers AND anchovies was a touch too salty). 

All in all, we'll definitely be back next time we're looking to indulge in some wood fired pizza."}
{"text":"Good Neapolitan Pizza, service was also neat and fast.
They use fresh products and the dough had that nice soft center and crunchy end.
It was missing only a bit more flavor on their sauce there for the 4 stars.
I will definitely go back.
Price is excellent for their quality."}
{"text":"Awesome pizza and atmosphere.  I recommend calling ahead as I almost missed out on a table by not having a reservation."}
{"text":"I'm scared that 850 Degrees has spoiled me of any other pizza for life!  I would say call Guy Fieri and get it featured on Diners, Drive-Ins and Dives but it doesn't fall under any of those categories - it's pretty nice inside.

After it's been open for what, almost two years, I finally tried it last week.  I ordered the Dave Bolland (Calabrese salami, fior di latte cheese and tomato sauce).  I've eaten pizza from a lot of different restaurants and this is the best ever!  The crust was so light and I know they used the finest of ingredients because you can go for that third, fourth slice and not feel like a dirt bag.  The Calabrese salami was outstanding; seriously, I don't know where they get it from but now I don't know if any other will compare.  They put so much of it on the pizza too and didn't skimp on it or the other ingredients as well.  Not to mention the sauce was like nothing I've ever tasted - little hints of garlic (but not overpowering) in every bite.  No word of a lie but I could eat this pizza every single day.

The only drawbacks were that I was a little confused about the pricing on the menu so I called ahead and the phone must have rang about 15 times.  I thought I had the wrong number so I called again and same thing but this time someone (very nice) answered.  I said I'd call back when I was leaving No Frills to place the order but, that time, they just didn't pick-up PERIOD.  I kept trying and trying but, eventually, the nice person answered, took my order and it was ready in time.  Anyway, could have been just one-off but, if you try to order over the phone and no answer, just go into the restaurant as the pizza only takes a few minutes to prepare.

5+++ stars!"}
{"text":"I've been wanting to visit this place for about 9 months now but keep putting it off and putting it off. Fortunately last night that putting it off came to an end.

The restaurant was busy for a Sunday night, almost full which was a great sign. There is a small patio out front and if you get there early enough you can likely snag a seat but we sat inside which was just comfortable also.

The service was excellent and the staff very friendly.

We started with the Tomato Mozza Salad which had nice creamy buffalo mozzarella on fresh tomatoes with some olives and arugula. This was one of the best mozzarella salads I've had in the city in a long time as everyone nowadays is just using the cheap cheese and this was nice and soft. ($7.95 for the small)

We followed this up with the polenta dish which had an antipasto mixture on top and was so flavourful. Definitely worth trying! ($8.95 for the small)

Next up were the pizzas. I opted for the Rocket & my fiancé went for the Superman. The rocket came loaded with prosciutto on top and Parmesan cheese. I can't remember all the ingredients for both but they were both delicious. Nice light crust that reminded me of eating pizza back in Naples. (Pizzas were about $12-$15)

Dinner for 2 with apps, a glass of wine and a cider, 2 pizzas came to around $70 with tax and gratuity. I will definitely be going back!"}
{"text":"Having driven past this place on Lakeshore, just east of the Mississauga border, many times, I decided to try out the pizza. The name indicates the temperature at which the pizza is cooked and I think there is a correlation somewhere with more well-known place called 800 degrees. Regardless of the heat of the oven, I don't think they have the dough quite right. It tasted like we were eating a whole wheat dough; a little dry and tasteless.

We ordered the Lord Stanley with ham, fresh mushrooms, roasted peppers and fior de latte cheese and it was just ok. The dough was dry and the toppings lacked flavor. Might be a low-sodium thing. 

The menu seems like a haute cusine of innovative pizzas, however a little southern Italian comfort would also have been nice. Even just a simple salad would have been welcome. Instead, the salads and the pizzas are centred around popular new \"buzz\" ingredients like quinoa polenta and wild boar sausage....all good but some simpler ingredients like \"mozzarella\" would also be welcome.

Yes the place is \"hip\" with a modern flair and that \"still new\" environment. The tables and steel chairs are not that comfortable. They do have a patio that is adjacent to a very busy Lakeshore Road. And as the \"hipster\" seen goes, make sure you call for a reservation. We arrived at 1:30 on a Saturday with the place nearly empty and were asked if we had a reservation. When we said we didn't, the lone waitress in the place looked around as to where to put us and then said they would need the table where we were sitting for 2:00 pm. Of course even after we left at 2:30, the place was still empty.

Service is friendly but slow. It took us 15 minutes to get our bill. They also punch in the amount manually into the pin pad when paying and ours was out like $10 from what it should have been, so make sure you check that.

Overall I think I would go back for the ambiance on a busy Friday night with friends. But if I want great pizza, I'd go to Dino's which is 15 minutes away on Queensway near Royal York."}
{"text":"A friend and I tried 850 degrees today. We shared the Polpette Al Forno appetizer meatballs with pizza bread.  I had The Rocket and my friend had Bloor by the park. 
The pizza crust crunchy on the outside and light and fluffy on the inside, paired with local fresh ingredients. Fantastic food and reasonably priced. We will definitely be back. 
I was told by the waitress that they get busy on the weekends, reservations are strongly recommended."}
{"text":"Service - friendly and accommodating 

Venue - love the patio! 

Food - Very impressed! I was definitely not expecting the menu to be so innovative! (for the area....) Had the Mozza & Tomato salad, while simple, highlights the quality of ingredients they use. Got the Long Branch (hollaa!) pizza which was amazing, however I did find the crust to be a bit more soft in the centre then I would have preferred. 

I will definitely return to try their other pizzas!"}
{"text":"Amazing restaurant !  We had the pizza bread with garlic, ten times better than any garlic bread anywhere. The spicy salami pizza was delicious, the dough is so light and fluffy. Will definitely be back !"}
{"text":"It was my last day in Toronto before I flew back to Los Angeles, so I yelped a place close by to where I was staying for lunch.  This place had good reviews so my cousin, uncle and I came here for lunch.

We were their first customers when we promptly arrived at 11:30am and decided to sit on their patio outside since it was such a nice day out.  

Our waitress quickly came out and brought us water and took our drink order.  The placemat is the menu so we were easily able figure out what we wanted to order.  Their menu consist of various thin wood-fired pizzas (8 or 12 inches), build you own, salads, and pastas.  They has several bottled beers, wine, and a pomegranate ginger ale which was so refreshing.

We started with the antipasto plate and the free garlic bread with check-in which came with two different meats, cheese, olives, eggplant, artichokes, mushrooms, and roasted vegetables.  It was a great starter to share and the garlic bread was great.

Then we ordered three different pizzas to share, the rocket which had arugula and ham, the oh canada with ham and egg, and the superman with spinach, olives, and pepperoni.  We tried to order the muskoka pizza with sausage, but they didn't have any sausage.

The pizzas were overall good, but not as crispy as I was hoping.  I also thought they were a bit skimpy of the tomato sauce and cheese on all the pizzas.  Of the three we tried, the oh canada was my fav because an egg on top makes everything taste better.  They also give you chile oil on the side which I used to dip the crust in.

Service was very pleasant and attentive.  Our waitress was great at checking up on us with us choosing to sit outside.  Parking is directly on the street in the Long Branch neighborhood."}
{"text":"We've been coming here for 3 years, it's a nice family restaurant with a decent wine list and a few cider options, not to mention awesome desserts (according to my kids who love their Tiramisu.)
My favourite pizza is the Long Branch, it's a nice combo of eggplant and olives, handy that they also have vegan cheese (Daiya), it melts really well in that oven!"}
{"text":"Came on a busy Friday night and the restaurant was very busy. Although we didn't have a reservation the wait wasn't that long. Service was lovely and waitresses did their best to be attentive while the kitchen was a little behind. She even gave us a complimentary dessert for the longer wait time for our food which was very kind of her to do.

The food overall was good, the pizza seemed to be the main focus of the menu but we were quite disappointed with it (we ordered the superman pizza but it was greasy and lacked flavour). We also ordered the pasta al forno, which was quite delicious except I expected it topped with a layer of mozzarella cheese but there were only bits of cheese found inside of the pasta. 

Our appetizers were the meatballs in tomato sauce and that was also disappointing as it tasted very dry and unflavourful with minimal tomato sauce. The cannoli tasted a little stale but enjoyed the presentation with fruits and caramel.

It was a good experience but don't think I would visit here again, if I do I will probably stick to the pasta choices!"}
{"text":"This place is small, but the food is incredible. We had pizza and pasta and both amazing. Great for friends night out or date night. Casual."}
{"text":"Best awesome pizza I've ever had? Friendly and quick service. I will be regular customer for sure."}
{"text":"Good local Pizza joint in Long Branch. Funny quirky pizza names, friendly service with a smile and a homey feel in the environment."}
{"text":"4.5 stars. Passing by this place by accident and we decided to try it out.
We ordered the The Group of 7 and the Pasta Al Forno. 
I love the pizza crust and the pasta sauce. They are yummy as all the ingredients they used are mostly fresh and local grown. Yumm.. I can't wait to come back again.

The only drawback is that we weren't greeted by a warm welcome to whom he shall not be name ;). The staffs (Servers) were standing the champions that night. Anyway, we are delighted to go back next time."}
{"text":"Bumped up for atmosphere, nice touches like a carafe of lemon water w/ a mint leaf, tulips on the table, and friendly service!

Before you rush out and try 850 based on my 4* rating, read breakdown.  As far as pizza is concerned in Toronto, I've eaten at Libretto, Dino's, Lo Zingaro, Famoso (Yorkdale) & Marcello's (Vaughan).  And out of the lot, I would not say that 850 was the best, HOWEVER that does not mean that it's the worse either.

The crust is not entirely thin throughout as the edge is definitely THICKER.  If it's thin crust, I prefer thin for the entire pizza.  Where the crust was thicker, the dough was definitely denser than all the places listed above.

Ordered SHINNY/B.C. - 3.5/5.  Shinny was quite wet and I think it's due to the fior di latte.  Especially where the crust was thinner, it was quite soppy.  B.C. - Decent, but I'd recommend ordering a pizza with cheese &/or with meat.

TIRAMISU - 4/5.  Made in-house.  Was pretty good, not overly sweet, light.  Good value for size, totally shareable!

Price points are GOOD, ~$13 for a 12\" pizza which I can almost finish in one sitting.  Service was very friendly.  Food was a bit slow to roll out, approx. 15mins+ for a pizza.  And since restaurant is new, it has a nice ambiance which did get full on a Friday night!

I'd say if you're going for pizza, definitely order something with cheese &/or meat if possible."}
{"text":"Thin handmade aromatic pizzas!!! 

The pizzeria is located near Longbranch TTC station and there is an ample of street parking there. The place is always busy during weekends. 

They offer pizzas, salads and pasta along with some sides.  On yelp check-in, you get a complimentary garlic bread which is handmade bread with garlic butter on top. It is delicious!
They offer cheese platter for 12$, it is a steal deal. The platter is huge. They have salad in 2 sizes, for me, even the smaller size was way more than enough. 

The pizzas: a very thin pizza-base with aromatic sauce and fresh toppings, Italian style pizza! I loved it. It looks big when it arrives but it is not that heavy on your tummy :)

Do not forget to check their seasonal menu. 

Drinks Menu: They have a decent collection of beers & Wines, along with some non- alcoholic drinks. I love their 3.5$ 591 ml of Calypso Ice Tea/ Lemonade.

The location is awesome, ambience is rustic (nice one) and prices are really great! And the food that matters most: excellent, service: good!"}
{"text":"Great Place!
The staff is prompt and attentive and very nice!
Food is always great. Never a disappointment!!"}
{"text":"Free garlic bread with Yelp check in! Woooooo!

Absolutely love this place! They have a great option of 8.5\" pizza instead of 12\", which is a perfect size!
Booked on Open Table and got seated right away.
Scored my free garlic bread and had the antipasto platter to start. Great variety on the platter!
I had the Rocket pizza, and Patti had the Superman! Perfectly cooked!

No dessert tonight, we were stuffed! I did see a tirimasu go by a few times to other tables, but didnt have a good look at the dessert menu.

Can't wait to live a block away from this place! I will be a regular for sure!"}
{"text":"This place us adorable! Cleanly chic and bright! (Not like the usual dimmed down \"ambiance\" lighting) which is great bc you can actually see your food! We also spoke to the owner! Great irish guy Chris, we requested to meet him because our party was mostly irish too! 

My party ordered the antipasto with foccica to start, the courtesy of Yelp garlic bread, and a cheese covered garlic bread. ALL delicious!  Got the dinner portion: 
The Canuck: which was packed full of hot peppers! But in all fairness, upon ordering they warn you and double check that you indeed want the heat! (Or at least Jen - our lovely waitress did)
Oh Canada: Can you say bfast on a pizza?! Maple flavored bacon! Topped with an egg! The egg on this particular pizza however was fully cooked, when I believe over easy is the goal so that is spreads on the pizza. (Maybe upon reorder we will request the egg not fully cooked) 
The Rocket: so much fresh arugula and prosciutto!  The freshness adds a nice texture to the usual pizza flavor. 

Pasta: Pollo e Fungi. Sadly this was the dissapointment of the evening. To begin with: it isn't a pretty dish. It looks very thrown together. The pasta does taste freshly made but there is WAY TOO MUCH SAUCE to get through to even taste the pasta. Perhaps going lighter on the sauce would allow the customer to ask for extra (easier to add more then take out!) The large quantity of sauce I feel is what causes the rest of the dishes problems. For example, the chargrilled chicken - you cannot tell if it is grilled or not because it has drowned in the sauce. The eggplant and mushrooms are also cut too largely. With cuts of wild mushroom as large as they came, it becomes tough and stringy, which is not enjoyable. Also because the skin of eggplant doesn't \"reduce\" there were very large skin chunks in the dish of sauce. Also the dish is said to have a drizzle of truffle oil...where?! IN THE SAUCE?! you cannot taste it. It would be much better presented with the sauce in the middle of the fresh pasta, with the chicken sitting on top of the sauce, and the truffle oil drizzled across the plate so it's visible and then the customer can mix at their own will. 

All in all though, great place!  Will return!! :)"}
{"text":"Given the continued high value for money 850 now rates a full five stars. We have likely been there 20-30 times over the last two years. Could it be a more cozy spot? Yes it could, but that's simply missing the point."}
{"text":"Went there a few times with my boyfriend and we were always satisfied in each visit. Great food, nice atmosphere and very friendly service! Tried the Long Branch, BC, Old York and M'ikmaq (personal favorite). Also had their DIY salad, garlic bread, Mozza & Tomato Salad and Tiramisu. The lemon water with mint garnish was a nice touch. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I came to visit Canada over the weekend and our first night were in the mood for pizza/Italian.  Good ole yelp landed us to this place based on reviews. The food was absolutely delicious!  I had the ravioli with beef and I'm still drooling over it today. Hope to be back in Canada soon and of course will be stopping by :)"}
{"text":"Yesterday dinner was a nice surprise. Very simple and sofisticated at the same time. The superman pizza was really good. Also tried the St. John pizza and it was delicious. We were 8 people and everybody was happy. The service was special and the Ontario wine was good. I will recommend this place to my friends, not a word to my enemies"}
{"text":"I was in the area and had this place bookmark for awhile. 
I went here on a Monday evening so the restaurant was not busy. They did have a patio sitting area as well. 

I like how they had the menu already placed out on every table. Make sure to check-in for the free garlic bread. 
My partner and I both shared the David Bolland pizza ($14.50) Calabrese salami, fior di latte cheese & tomato sauce and Pasta Di Polpette ($13.95) Fresh pasta, handmade meatballs in a tomato sauce with parmesan cheese. 

We both enjoy the pizza, the pizza was very tasty. The bread taste very fluffy. The pasta was okay. I didn't like the meatball as much, it was a tad bit dry. 

Overall is was a okay. The food didn't really wow us but the service here was very good. The waitress are very attentive and always checking on us. It's a good restaurant to try if your ever in the area!"}
{"text":"Italian pizza at its best, perfect thin crust, and amazing sauce and toppings. I tried the mushroom 12\" pizza per the courteous' waitress recommendation, it was perfect. 
The house salad dressing is really good as well, excellent service, clean, timely, no complaints. 
Prices are reasonable
My 12\" pizza was $14
Small salad is a good portion, and is only $5

If you like Italian pizza, give it a try."}
{"text":"It's perfect. I haven't had such good pizza in a really long time. Ambience is nice, service was excellent, food was fantastic. I had the lunch size David Bolland pizza. Crust had the perfect ratio of chewy to crispy. Tomato sauce and cheese were really good. The calabrese was refreshingly spicy. I will most certainly be back."}
{"text":"I tried this place out for the first time last week, I got the Canuck I believe which had pepperoni and bacon.... Sooooo GOOD! Pizza crust was amazing, nice wood oven taste, and the sauce was just great. I also ordered a side of meatballs, and they were probably the best I've ever had. Following week, I had preferred myself the beef ravioli, and those were really good also! Just a little overpriced in my opinion, but because of the taste, and the fact you just get that super fresh feeling when eating it, I might just be able to let it slide. The place is nice inside, very vibrant, and you just can't feel depressed sitting in there. 

Highly recommend"}
{"text":"Awesome local joint in Etobicoke!  The service is always solid, and the food is delicious!"}
{"text":"So good!  We were visiting for South Carolina and happened upon this pizza place.  Our server was wonderful, and the food was delicious.   If you like a farm to table feel, this is a good choice.  It also seemed to be a local place, which is always a bonus when traveling to a new place.   If it's full of locals, it's gonna be good and it was!"}
{"text":"My hairdresser recommended this place to me and I went with my husband.  Amazing patio, very friendly service, great wine list, and the pizza I ordered was stupendous!  The only (minor) complaint I have is that they didn't do ingredient substitutions, so my pizza ended up having double the cheese I had wanted (I recognize, that this is a first world problem if I've ever seen one.). I would definitely come here again!  Note on certain nights they have live music inside."}
{"text":"First of all, I'll like to give this place a shout-out for the free Yelp \"Garlic Bread\".

I give this place a \"A\" for effort for being a successful small business in Etobicoke, but the food simply doesn't cut it for me. I understand they use local ingredients, and all that good stuff, but the taste is simply absent. As a Italian restaurant aficionado, I had never seen Prosciutto (in antipasto misto) that looks like Roast Beef (colour wise). Thus, nice little place in the area, but I'll still go for a Pizzaiolo if I'm craving a Pizza."}
{"text":"I love the pizza here. The staff is friendly and the patio is nice in the summer. My family visits here regularly."}
{"text":"The pizza was really good! There are all kinds of pizzas to order from, and pastas and salad. This place is a trendy spot in downtown Toronto. Prices were right and our server, Crystal, was very sweet.

I felt like the pizzas are on the thinner side. I like my pizzas thick, so that's why I give it 4 stars.

Otherwise, worth the visit!"}
{"text":"Just outstanding. From the Caprese salad (this is the way it should be made and presented, its so simple but so many restaurants are screwing this up) with the delicious Mozzarella and sweet tomatoes and fresh basil, to the 4 cheese pizza (Oka, Emmenthal, Provolone, Fior di latte) to the excellent friendly service (Brazilian girl that I bet my wife was french-Canadian, I lost) I loved this place and meal. Thank you for an excellent experience, actually one of the meal highlights of our vacation (visiting Canada from North Carolina)."}
{"text":"Second time at 850 after many months. I stand by my previous 5-star review, the place is always busy however the service is excellent and the food is amazing! They use fresh local ingredients and it really shows in the taste. The hardest part is choosing your pizza as all options are mouth watering. My favourite by far is the Long Branch (all veggies).
They also have a nice beer selection as well as monthly specials.
Be sure to check in so you can get free garlic bread (yummy!)"}
{"text":"Love the new addition to our area! The pizza are delicious. My favorite is the one with sweet bacon and sunny side up egg on it. My husband loves their artichoke pizza. The mozzarella salad is really good as well. Their pasta selection is limited and not very good, it needs some improvement. But who cares their pizza is delicious! We get takeout from here often. Owner is a nice Irish guy, very friendly. The waitresses are just okay. A bit inattentive but I think cause it is new so they havent gotten into the flow of things. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"Absolutely amazing Pizza! David Bouland is my favourite. The callebrese is spicy and their home made tomato sauce has a sweetness and favour that us out of this world! Staff is super friendly and restaurant is bright nicely decorated with fresh orange garber daisies. Love this place, what a find!"}
