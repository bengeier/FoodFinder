{"text":"The best beef kebab EVER!! The meat is so tender and juicey - just be careful not to touch the bottom of the metal skewer when it arrives - it's super hot. Make sure to also order the garlic sauce and red meat sauce for dipping. It's a warm atmosphere with a very friendly staff. I've gotten many friends hooked on this place. 5/5."}
{"text":"nice try but russian food is not authentic middle eastern food! not what i was looking for at all. they have some \"middle eastern style\" dishes but like i said, not authentic. definitely not going back."}
{"text":"Came here with a group of my friends. Most of us ordered chicken shawarma and beef/chicken kebob dinners. They all come with a side of salad and rice/fries/house potatoes and you can choose either small or regular portion. A small dinner is about $8.99 and regular is $11.99. My chicken kebob was pretty good, not too dry and had good flavor. I tried some of my friends chicken shawarma and it was way too dry. House potatoes are flavored with butter and garlic which was super salty. Had to take it off of the potatoes or else it's like eating chunks of sea salt. Also comes with pita bread, pickled veggies to share and dill and tomato/salsa sauce.   Service was okay, felt like our food took a while to come out. Not sure if it's just the day I went but it was super hot and stuffy in the restaurant. No air conditioning or fans.   Overall, I'd come back again and try their other kebobs as they are grilled nicely and price is reasonable."}
{"text":"I've never dine-in at this restaurant and only ordered take out over 100 times. The food is good. My favourite is their lamb kabob with rice. My family loves their chicken kabob, dark meat. I would have given them four stars but only gave 3 due to portion size and price - this is in comparison to Revivo (sp?) Restaurant in Thornhill (near Promenade Mall)."}
{"text":"People are definitely overrated this place. Food is reasonable and a ok. Deco -1 star and the untrained staff -1 star even though he's friendly. Longer than expected wait time for the food since there's only one other table. They really need home made flesh hot pita bread rather than then stone cold pita."}
{"text":"If food was all I'm basing my stars on, then this little hole-in-a-wall would easily garner 5 if them. I decided to give this place a try one evening and ordered a full portion lamb shish kebab, which came with rice, potatoes and salad, and I was floored by how amazing it was! The lamb was succulent, tender and wonderfully seasoned. The soft and fluffy seasoned rice was the best I've had in a Mediterranean restaurant, surpassing most of the more elegant restaurants. The \"full portion\" was generous at only $14.99 (see the pics I posted).   The ONLY reason I'm taking 1 star away is because my experience there was marred by the fact that this young guy they had working there was incredibly drunk the evening I was there. When I was done with my meal and got up to pay at the counter, he pretty much forced me into a weird, drunken conversation (I kept trying to get him to just take my money but he wouldn't, and would get a bit aggressive and acted insulted when I kept insisting that I needed to go home) and due to his drunken state, he got quite borderline aggressive at times. Much to my dismay, the grill cook seemed helpless to barge in, even though I kept asking if he would please complete the check out for me. (Drunk guy seemed unable to press any of the correct buttons on their cash register.) Even more disappointing was the fact that the owner of the restaurant, an older gentleman, was sitting at a nearby table with two of his buddies and seemed reluctant to come to a customer's rescue either, while the drunk young guy got louder and louder and was drunkenly knocking some stuff off the counter by this point. The drunk guy was probably a younger relative, because I can't imagine an ordinary employee being able to be like that and not get fired immediately. After almost 10 minutes of this, I was ready to just hand over my cash and forget about the change (just to get out of there) but the cook finally came over, very reluctantly, to settle the bill with me. The guy seemed kind of afraid of the younger drunk guy, actually.   I really want to return for the food. However, I'm not going back in there when that young guy is working, as he definitely makes me very uncomfortable."}
{"text":"Overall good food but nothing that is beyond that, food comes out fast which is good but my last experience is why I am writing the review Food did not come out hot or remotely warm my chicken was cold which makes me believe their food not made fresh"}
{"text":"Great ambience for a relaxed meal. Lamb soup best I've had. Wish I'd tried the specials they looked real good. Felafel was a good safe choice and was tasty. Portions are large so opt for small if there's a choice. Servce was good. Pleasant experience will go back. The kabob is not the minced variety but like pieces of steak. They are served on hudge skewers and the rice is out of this world. The location is lovely, sit by the window and watch the street. If you want a quick meal or a leisurly one this is the place to go."}
{"text":"This place I like!  I stumbled upon this place 4 years ago during a visit to Toronto while I was hunting for a shawarma shop on new year's eve, and it was canada411 that directed me to this shop. It is middle eastern in name only because the word shawarma appears on the menu. It is actually a great Russian restaurant with very good food. I go there a couple of times a year when I am visiting in Toronto and am never disappointed with my food. The place has room for a sit down meal but I have only been there for takeout. The kitchen is a very busy place so definitely do not expect some kind of McDonald's type of speed, and if you do then quickly hop into your car, run to a bank machine and then go find a big chain restaurant to pump you full of fat and salt. No, Orly's has very good food but you will have to wait for it -  it is indeed worth it in my opinion. I will be back there again."}
{"text":"My family loves this place and we often end up getting takeout from here.  The food is great--we've never branched out from the sandwiches, but the shawarma and falafel are crispy and flavourful and there are plenty of pickled toppings available to tart up the sweet tahini and garlic sauces.  The blonde girl working there is great--very smily and welcoming and willing to make your sandwich exactly as you want it.  The guy, though, is a jerk.  He fills the pitas the way he wants to and if you try to correct him, he'll grumble under his breath and roll his eyes at you.  Seriously, it's terrible.  Fortunately, it's really hard to ruin these sandwiches, and most of us are pretty easygoing about what goes on our sandwiches, but if you have any serious dietary restrictions, you'd better watch out."}
{"text":"I work close by this place and I  have a take out pretty often. Shawarma is tasty and juicy. Honestly, this is the best shawarma I've tryed in Toronto. The service is fast. Price is good. Thank you ans see you again! Helen"}
{"text":"The absolute BEST shawarma place ever. I always get the shawarma in a pita and its so good! The toppings are great (try the eggplant!), the service is good, and you can't beat the price!"}
{"text":"I have eaten here twice and enjoyed both meals very much.  I've tried the lamb and beef kebob dinner.  The meat was delicious and cooked perfectly.  There was a fresh salad and choice of fries, rice, or roast potatoes.  The price was reasonable.  The owner was very friendly to our family.  I will be visiting this restaurant again the next time I'm visiting Richmond Hill."}
{"text":"I live in the area and have eaten here few times in the past - that is why I have decided to rate it with four stars.  This time I have ordered \"to go\" and this was somehow an error.  First let me say that the stuff are very friendly and although the English language not always fluent (understatement of the year) they are definitely trying.  That is probably the reason why my pita was way over stuffed with salad and under stuffed with meat and chicken The meat was good however with an average of 3-4 pieces of meat it was hard to get a real taste.  I will not get Togo from them again, however I will definitely visit the restaurant for a table dinner"}
{"text":"Excellent place! Great food for amazing prices and the servoce is quiye nice."}
{"text":"Generous portions. Friendly staff. The shawarma is much better than other places. I would recommend it and would come again."}
{"text":"Very solid. It may become our new middle-eastern place since Anouch (sp) closers way too early. Also you get much more protein here than anywhere else and everything we order here is delicious. We always get a regular chicken shawarma."}
{"text":"Orly Grill is a treat whenever I am in the area. The fiance is from the neighbourhood and introduced me. He has been going here for years. So when we're around town we stop by for takeout before heading home to grab their chicken shawarma with rice. The portion is giant, the chicken is tender with crispy edges, they way I like it! And their rice has a hint of flavour. The only downside is the parking is limited out front."}
{"text":"My first visit and overall I would say the food was tasty but cooking execution/service could really improve I general the food was a bit undercooked and when I complained the answer I got from the young server (who I am guessing was related to the owner) was I will \"tell the chef for next time\". That's a really awful way to deal with a customer food complaint such as this in my humble opinion.   The cabbage rolls were very good and done nicely. The falafel plate was mixed. The falafel balls were a bit undercooked as were the fries. Salad dressing was very good as was there hot sauce.   With some many options in this food category I recommend Sofra grill just 5 mins away for a much better and consistent dining experience.   I also witnessed a 40m backlog for chicken shawarma which was not ready for a modestly busy lunch crowd. Not cool."}
{"text":"Not bad. Ordered falafel takeout, definitely not the best I've had. Way too much lemon, impossible to taste the actual herbs. Food took quite a while to come out, but the server was pleasant enough.  Might go again, but would not order the falafel."}
{"text":"I went to eat for dinner and had one of the best meals of my life. The chicken breast meal tasted delicious. The portions were more than enough. The workers were very kind and helpful. Strongly reccomed eating at this place."}
{"text":"orly? yes rly.   Great spot for a shawarma or kebab pita / plate. I had the lamb and it was perfectly cooked. Tasted great. The servers even walked over a few extra pieces of lamb to the table because they were feeling generous. Really pleasant experience. Happy to go back next time I'm in NY."}
{"text":"My husband and I were craving some falafel one December night around 10:30 pm so I called in to order ahead so we wouldn't barge in 5 minutes before closing. The guy on the phone was SO nice. He told me he would start the falafel, which takes some time to cook, so that when we came in we could pick our toppings and be on on our way. The fact that he made fresh falafel, right off the bat was a great sign.   When we came in, the falafel was ready, our pitas (choice of regular/whole wheat) were ready to be topped. The same guy (wish I'd got his name) from the phone served us and was super friendly, and very generous with the toppings. Overall, it was my top two falafel pita in the city, and I would go back simply for the service."}
{"text":"The guy manning the place is so quick! Liked the shawarma, better than paramount. The rice was nice and fluffy. Would come again."}
{"text":"Felt like shawarma one morning; saw this in area. Not bad, but not the best. Dont like their spin on shawarma, which is the pita bread instead of ur regular wrap. The beef kebab dinner was great tho."}
{"text":"Very good, I went for chicken shawarma and salad and it was delicious. I will definitely be back. The food all looked fresh and tasty."}
{"text":"Tasty and flavourful shawarma, but I don't like how they put the veggies in the bottom.... First half is only chicken and the end had the veggies. Not Mixed well. The last time I've been I also found that the shawarma was over cooked and really hard to bite down on."}
{"text":"popped in here during lunch, and of course it's because I was craving my New York style chicken on the rocks.  the portion was huge but it wasn't satisfying. the rice was over cooked but the chicken was good - I was looking for that perfect garlic sauce but it wasn't enough in the meal. I had to go back and ask for more - which cost me an extra 50 cents. without it my meal would have been dry."}
{"text":"today when we dropped in food was fresh. Over time the harchow soup has changed i much prefer the clear version. Lately it is more thick. Great lula kebab, crunchy salad, home made hot sauce and garlic sauce. Flavored potatoes and yellow rice. Mouth watering, flavorful and to share or not depending on what you like. Portion size may have reduced since the last time i came here."}
{"text":"its ok, but honestly not as good as suliko (see my review) which has become the benchmark for CIS restaurants in north york.  the service is slow. 2/5  the food is not bad, delicious actually but honestly the dinner portions are average at best, making me think they are inconsistent since others have said that they are huge. 4/5  price are low. 4/5  location 3/5 run down strip mall.  the interior is run down and full of semi-drunks 2/5.  I guess it is a polarizing place, isnt it? lesson is that if you like declicious take out at a reasonable price, go here, if you like a cultural experience in a sit down place that is nice and has good food for a good price, go to suliko.."}
{"text":"Good food and good prices! Got take out and was full from the small size chicken shawarma! Will be coming back!"}
{"text":"Orly Grill located in a strip plaza so parking can be limited. Been here twice now and it was great both time. Portion is generous as I got the Large Shawarma dinner twice and always filled me up and more.  Place is clean with 5-6 tables.  Friendly staff as well.  Will be back for more"}
{"text":"Difficult to order. The menu is vague, and the sandwich toppings are very different from what I'm used to.  That said, what I ended up with tasted great."}
{"text":"It was just barely O.K. for me. I'm going to give 3 stars instead of 2 because I arrived late and they were out of chicken shawarma, so I had to order other items, so I'm scoring it generously.  Lamb shish-kebab on a pita was a soggy disorganized mess, with the pita improperly cut and loosely wrapped and completely unable to corral its contents, resulting in something that was much closer to a wrapper full of 'finger stew' than anything remotely resembling a sandwich. Completely unable to hold a candle to the lamb shish kabob sandwich from Jerusalem takeout on Leslie.  The chicken shish kabob dinner fared better, with the flavorful buttery rice quite enjoyable, a few chunks of chicken kebab dark meat which was juicy and not overcooked, but the potatoes cut overly large, chunky, starchy and bland, quite a disappointment after reading such enthusiastic reviews.  Service was friendly and really pleasant courtesy of the two lovely young ladies running the show around 8 p.m. on a Tuesday, but sadly the food did not impress.  It is my intention to go back and give the shawarma another chance, but honestly, I won't be in a hurry to return, based on this first visit."}
{"text":"I agree with the previous reviews on the portion size here...they are huge! I got a small chicken sharwama plate ($10) and I couldn't finish everything in one go. However, the taste of the meat is decent, but it is not Halal Guys in NYC. The salad that came with the plate didn't taste that great due to the overwelming flavours of the dressing. The wait time here could be quite long compared to other sharwama joints, where I waited around 15mins for my food. I would not suggest dining in similar to the reasons of the other reviewers. Overall, I would come back and have take-out if I was craving for some portion/price friendly sharwamas!"}
{"text":"I've been eating here for the last couple years, I always get either the beef or chicken pita with harcho soup. The pitas are huge! The coleslaw filling is the best, meat is grilled perfectly.. so tender and flavorful! The dinner plates are also excellent, love the fluffy rice and garlic potatoes!   Parking is in this small lot, it can get tight but it's ok. Definitely recommend this restaurant. The staff that work here are super nice too!"}
{"text":"This is HANDS DOWN the BEST restaurant with the BEST food and the BEST service in all of Richmond Hill. I travel from Toronto to eat their delicious shawarma dinner. The rice is always moist. Potatoes always crunchy and the bread ks always warm. This place will not disappoint. And the best part is that your meal will never cost more than $15. Keep up the good work! I love love LOVE Orly Grill"}
{"text":"Bathurst Manor has so many russian / persian/ israeli / ukrainian / georgian style kebab places; that it is hard to not fall in love with one and stick to it. I personally can vouch for Belle / Me Va Me/ Mr combo / Aragvi.   Yet, the adventurer in me brought me into Orly's. Boy was I surprised.   \"THAT RICE THO!!! like on fleek ...swagger on a mill!!\"  cough cough *clears throat* excuse me..my inner ratchet came out.  A giant portion of yummy yellow rice and house potatoes to accompany these large chunks of Lamb that were grilled to perfection. So soft. The garlic sauce to accompany tasted home made and their hot sauce complimented items well. Even tho its tomato paste to me; however my palate can handle quite a lot of spices. Im definately coming back; as that rice was amazing. Those of you who have tried nando's (like the whole world should have by now). It is similar to their rice but waaaaaaaaaaaaay better!"}
{"text":"Came here with my bro for a post-workout meal. He's been going here for months and always gets the same thing. Dark meat grilled chicken with rice and potatoes.  He goes crazy for the rice, but I think it's just ok. It tastes great, but it's not as dry and fluffy as I prefer. I LOVED the potatoes and the chicken was cooked perfectly.   We'll probably be back for another post-workout eatfest.   Atmosphere is very very casual, service was friendly. You order at the counter and they take the food to your table."}
{"text":"Worst service,  tables that got there after us were served first and received their orders first. Waited 45 mins for a shawarma wrap... Server was not apologetic at all, will not come back. Prevented us from enjoying the food."}
{"text":"Looks sketchy, but this run-down place has a lot to offer!  Shawarma plate is probably the best deal here. The portion is unbelievably huge...two people can share this plate! So good and reasonably priced.  The meat is so tasty and tender. The salad is fresh and the rice is yummy!  The cashier was really friendly when I went there.  They also serve alcohol.  There are really weird people that come and go. Place is run down. Nothing fancy at all.  But you definitely should go here for the Sh awarma plate because it is so delicious and huge!"}
{"text":"Chicken shawarma dinner was very hearty and the aromas is what I noticed first.  The sauces were excellent.  Everything was fresh. The potatoes I cant even describe, I've never had anything like it before and I have enjoyed all kinds of Middle Eastern styles of cuisines.  Friendly service too."}
{"text":"This wins my vote for the BEST chicken shawarma in the city. I didn't expect this place to be so good, especially in this highly forgettable plaza.  THIS is how you make shawarma. Meal came with salad (pretty standard), garlic potatoes and rice. I guess what made it so good was that the chicken had nice flavor by itself. Some places make it really dry and tasteless and you must add sauce to be palatable. In here, I enjoyed the chicken pieces without needing any sauce! In fact, it tastes so good I would choose not to dilute it with any sauce! Also, the chicken had a nice little char (not burnt) texture on it which makes the outer layer almost crispy. It's awesome.The potatoes are what you expect garlic potatoes to taste like, but better because the outer layer also has that char texture. And finally instead of white rice, you get some seasoned rice which I assume was cooked with chicken broth due to the yellowness? Seasoned rice definitely makes it taste better than white rice.  Price wise it is totally worth it. Regular size was $13+ tax but I would totally do it again. I know there are cheaper shawarma places out there but they don't produce the same taste. Also, the portion is HUUUGGGEEE. You get your money's worth here and you can easily share with 2 people. I'd say it easily has double the portion of other run of the mill shawarma places."}
{"text":"Worst Customer Service.  I walked in and was ready to order. This lady walks up to me (looked very rude) and told me to take a look at the menu. To get a shawarma, she rudely told me \"15 minutes, take a seat\". I sat down and looking at how empty the restaurant was. Couple of people came in and the same waitress was happy to see them and kicked me off my seat to place them at where I was sitting. I was waiting for my food but decided to leave instead. Poor customer service. I only wanted to try the place."}
{"text":"Did take out here. They were doing renovations so it was quite dusty Portions weren't too much on the chicken shawarma plate ordered, but way too much rice which was a bit damp. I added hummus and some wedges and it came to 30 dollars. Surprising that it is a one $ restaurant."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I are highly addicted to this place... We were so addicted to the point where we both had come to the agreement that we can only it here once a month. The rice is out of this world!!! I don't know what they put in it, but it's seriously delicious. The chicken is moist. The food is always made to order so it's fresh! Definitely best chicken dinner in North York.   Make sure you get extra garlic sauce and hot sauce when you eat here :)"}
{"text":"Big portions Actually fresh and tender chicken Get the diner plate  Friendly dude that service"}
{"text":"Excellent value for money. Very large portions. The shwarma meat is perfectly cooked and seasoned the way I like it (nice and simple, very classic shwarma taste). Toppings include various types of cabbage/salad, tomatoes, onions pickled radishes, garlic sauce and hot sauce.   The shwarma dinners are huuge. There is no way I could have finished this by myself. It is served on an oval platter and includes half rice, half meat, a few potato wedges, onions, pickled peppers, white sauce and hot sauce. Also includes a starter salad. Whaaat so much food! Ps. The hot sauce smells amazing, but I can't handle spicy food so I didn't try it. Garlicy potatoes are so delicious! Yum!  My bf and I were served by the same young, hard working chef/server with blonde streaks in his hair. He strikes me as very nice and is always making a joke here and there. I love this guy and this little place and will definitely come back many many more times."}
{"text":"Orly Grill's decor is definitely way past its prime time, but you're not coming here to gaze at the decor. You come here to eat yummy-for-my-tummy Middle Eastern/Arabic/Israeli inspired cuisine.  The food is extremely delicious and the staff very friendly.  The Chicken Schwarma was freshly cut from the griddle and the topics were all fresh tasting. The kitchen is of open design so you see right in to every nook and cranny. I like this cause you know exactly where the food is coming from.  Overall a very popular joint with the folks around the area who know it and will definitely be coming back to try as it's in fact one of the best Schwarma pitas I've ever had. (On the western continent)"}
{"text":"So you have your normal sized shawarmas in a pita- the portion you end up with when you're in a touristy area and shawarma is the  most exotic choice around.   Then you have your very generous, ballooning shawarmas in a pita- the kind offered by most authentic, hole-in-the-wall Middle Eastern spots.   Then there's Orly's sized.   The kind that makes you question what your stomach lining is made of and how is it able to accommodate this wrap that looks like it can feed a small Arabic army.  Above and beyond just being generous with their portions, they also offer a larger variety of fresh toppings compared to your typical shawarma places. All of this at the very affordable price of $6.   If you're willing to overlook some questionable hygiene and outdated decor for some great food, Orly's would be recommended without reservation."}
{"text":"I hate to dissent from the other reviewers here who love this place, but I wasn't impressed. I got takeout delivered, and I was excited to eat since I love me some falafels. The size of the falafel wrap was impressive. However, the falafels themselves were dry and all the other ingredients/condiments were at the bottom of the pita, leaving me with one half of the wrap dry and one half kinda mushy and overbearing. The side of fries that were included with our combos were very basic and bland. On top of that, we paid nearly $40 CAD for two wrap/drink/fries combos for two people. Given the price point I was expecting exceptional quality food, but I got mediocrity instead. Maybe Orly Grill was having a bad night?"}
{"text":"Yummy food..love the portion,worth it..and people here are nice.. we had chicken shawarma plate. Excited to try lamb nexttimew"}
{"text":"This little spot has amazing food, and it definitely has reasonable pricing. The only complain I could have would be the outdated decor and depending on which server you get they can be a little cold. Who cares though when the food is great and doesn't make a hole in your wallet."}
{"text":"I was taking a super long yoga class one fine day a few weeks ago, and I ventured in Orly grill not expecting much. As far as eateries go, there is a little bakery, a Russian grocery store and a sushi restaurant in the same block.   Orly Grill regularly seems to have a few regular patrons picking up and eating in for lunch. I ordered the chicken shawarma pita for take-out and commenced my waiting... and waiting and waiting. It's not as though they were sitting on their hands, but if the restaurant is this busy, maybe they should hire more staff or preemptively warn customers about this wait before they pay.   20 minutes later, they begin preparing my lunch at which point I was hangry and considering my options in cannibalism. Then I see the gentleman who took my order grab a pita wrap with his bare hands.   Lessons Learned: 1. Chicken Shawarma can be delicious when provided within a considerate time-frame.  2. Apparently gloves are still optional in some restaurants."}
{"text":"Once. A good friend of mine Mr. Roushan told me about Orly Grill restaurant that he loves the taste of Doner Kebob or Shawarma there. Therefore, On Sunday July 24th, 2016 at 19:30 I went there and tried the chicken and ground beef Kebob with rice and salad, I  must admit that I really like the taste of all and really delicious. I will go back in the future with some friends to try the other foods certainty."}
{"text":"This place is amazing, that we came here twice in our stay. Fresh, healthy, and delicious meals! I love supporting local businesses. This place needs to come to California!"}
{"text":"I used to enjoy the food here, but poor hygiene was a major turn off. Not the cleanest place. I hope they read this and clean it up so I will go back."}
{"text":"The staff is nice 5 stars  The food is minus 5  I have never taste falafel or hummus or kabab like the one that this guys do  It's shameful to call it Middle Eastern food  Absolutely 0 star  I'm sorry but the truth is always hurt"}
{"text":"Hole in the wall?  Yes.  Great shawarma?  Double yes :)  We've been getting shawarma here for lazy takeouts more than a couple times now, and we're not even close to being tired of it.  No idea how they make anything, but it's an incredibly filling meal (enough for 2 people to share if you're not starving that day)- comes with a salad, lots of rice, and deliciously baked/grilled potatoes.  I've only ever gotten the chicken shawarma here, and it smells and tastes all kinds of Mediterranean heavenly    Very greasy though.  So... maybe once or twice a month is better for your cholesterol."}
{"text":"The chicken breast souvlaki platter I had here was delicious. Portions were really good as well. The rice and potatoes they serve taste amazing, that's what really pushed it over the top for me compared to other restaurants with similar food. Its a small store and I've had Asian food at another small mom and pop shop that was the best I've had and this is no different. Service is questionable, the younger guy who takes the orders seems a little arrogant and almost annoyed at times. But the food made up for most of it, ill be going back for the platter."}
{"text":"really a hole in the wall ! love their potato and rice besides the main dish. Thumbs up"}
{"text":"The food is the best . With a reasonable price ( between 5-20 $) you get a delicious food in a high quality. The chef (grisha) make food really well . The boss (mordachi) is nervous sometimes but his heart is really kind . If you have a good offer and pay cash , you can get a good discount ( no pay tax ) . Don't buy anything from this store when janna is there , because this girl charge you for everything and doesn't have a good manner. I think lula kebab , rack of lamb , chicken kebab is the best . Don't miss the best shawarma in Toronto, it's a really huge pita with a different taste , very delicious, very delicious. The yellow rice in this store is great . Don't forget lentil soup. Get my advice and go there , after that i am sure you are a permanent customer."}
{"text":"Very satisfying and well-priced. The garlic potatoes are fantastic and you can't fault the chicken nor the rice. The \"regular\" (realistically HUGE) portions for $2 more is a massive plate and good enough for two large meals (I do believe the prices on the website are outdated). The garlic sauce also tasted great and the spicy sauce provides an interesting 'afterburn'.  Service is lacking. Clearly their specialty is in take-out, the server is rarely in sight (in a small store) and didn't remember customizations (eg. we were asked if we wanted all potatoes, or half rice/half potatoes, and everyone got half/half).  There is limited parking in the lot, as it's shared with a large number of other establishments. The restaurant has a not-very-noticeable sign with a white background.  They do accept credit cards, which is set by default not to ask for tip (?). It will shop up on your credit card statement as Orely Grill (sic)."}
{"text":"I was quite pleased with my overall experience here. Value for dollar is great! I ordered take out around 6pm and they were pretty quick considering how busy they were.   I ordered a shawarma and falafel pita, both delicious. It was STUFFED!   I would give the place 4.5/5 just because the decor is pretty old and crap. The men's washroom is pink for goodness sakes!"}
{"text":"Good Food, good value..! Good people and good service, Our grand kids love their Babagannush, Hummus, Chicken plate..."}
{"text":"Picked up a chicken shwarma today while I was running errands.  This place is fairly close to where I live but I have never gone in until today.  Not the fanciest place around, BUT: the size of the pita pocket was HUGE, the chicken tasty, the vegetables definitely fresh, the hummous could have used a bit more garlic and lemon juice.  The owner is a character (in a good way).  The stuff is basic, but good and hits the spot.  I was very surprised - it looks somewhat unimpressive from the outside.  This is good, healthy, solid, basic fare without any hype or pretence."}
{"text":"Overall, this place isn't bad. t's simple, not spectacular, but you get good value for your money here. The israeli shawarma's have all the 'premium fixins' included in the price - i.e you don't pay anything extra as you do at other russian jewish joints.  The portions are decent and the staff are very friendly. Their soups are delicious.  Certain foods can be a little salty as i have now learned after two visits.   Getting served a decently priced shawarma with a smile is always nice."}
{"text":"Staffs are very welcoming and they know about their food. Probably the best shawarma I had in Toronto. Also love their potato!"}
{"text":"The comical and charming Russian server with the 'good hair day' everyday adds color to this humble establishment which is family owned and OWN shawarma making like a BOSS!!!  Pita stuffed with the works, chicken ALWAYS fresh. This ain't your typical reheated chicken from yesterday. Once they run out of the chicken meat, no leftovers from yesterday's seconds will land on your plate because they exercise quality like a gymnast on crack. No fast food practice here.  The portions are huge, this is definitely the better location compared to the one at Richmond Hill. Flavor rocks the taste buds with their garlicky side potatoes and tangy slaw that tops off as the shawarma's crowning glory.  My only one unpleasant experience is when a lady served us the shawarma plate and she forgot to top the rice with some onions and garlic sauce, (place was not busy, only one person dining in and one takeout customer) so I had to walk back from the car in the rain to kindly request for the toppings that add a gazillion notch to this dish, which she gladly did.   We quickly became frequent cravers and I cannot be more happy with a place that believe in making sure their customers are happy and I've seen the staff here welcome new faces and old ones with the most positive approach getting you hooked on their grub.   Daaaammmmn shawarma, come to mama!!!!"}
{"text":"The food was pretty good.  I would recommend getting the small dinner as the servings are quite large"}
{"text":"Great food and fast take out. Dated decor and some staff has facial expression like they are working for Satan, otherwise no complaints."}
{"text":"Pros: Great deeps and salads the Mushrooms are amazing! Fresh and tasty meet, home fries are the best side order, soups are very good for people who like Eastern European soups. Very good service!  Cons: Don't order Shuwarma after 4-5pm, it will be dry. The place could use some Reno, everything is pretty old.  Overall a very recommended place, especially for take outs."}
{"text":"I love this place. I found it 3-4 years ago just before I left Toronto and knew I hit a goldmine. It's a bit of a hole in the wall and it was generally quiet there back then but this time I'm back, it brighten up, a lot busier and the food is as good as ever.  Food wise, I got the beef (medium). It comes with fried potatoes (frikken awesome, very crunchy); meat is well seasoned, charcoally flavor; and rice, the absolute best. I don't know what it is about the rice but its soft, buttery, super fragrant. They have pickled onions and a few jalapeno on the rice, which definitely adds to the whole date. there are two sizes, small, which comes with one skewer (~9.99 or so), and reg that comes with two (13.99). Reg is really big and can easily feed two moderately hungry people.  Oh ya, it starts off with a leafy salad with a light sauce. Greens are very fresh.  My friend got the chicken. It was all thigh, well seasoned, and soft.   This place is the bomb. The service is really good. The guy there is really friend. He kept offering me the bar (they have a license!) as a joke since I was waiting on my friend. I asked him to tell me how to make the rice but he said he'd have to kill me. I'll kill to have more of that rice.  Only downside is that it's chilly in the restaurant close to the door. They don't open the heat. Perhaps it gets too hot near the bbq if the place was heated. It bothered me a bit until the food came, then I didn't care anymore.  Go to this place!"}
{"text":"I asked for shawarma wrap, when I got is it was so dry and all the vegetables were old . I asked the worker why it's looks so bad . She said \" what do u want it's evening now and the shawarma is from the morning \" I am like what ????? Never go back . Not fresh .  Just bad ."}
{"text":"As we live in the general neighbourhood we frequent Orly Grill about once a month.  The staff are all very friendly and efficient.  I love how you can watch them throw your kebabs onto the grill.  Their beef kebabs are the best.  They are always made the way you want them, and they are well seasoned and always juicy and succulent.  The rice that goes with it is a bit too unnaturally yellow for me and not as flavourful as I would like it, so we often go for the fries instead.  Their salad is fresh with a great dressing.  Not sure if it is made in house, but I like how the dressing is not too sour and a well balanced flavour.  They have several hot sauces and I love the green one they have.    Their falafel side order is a bit inconsistent, when it is great it is great...but once in awhile they are either overcooked or undercooked."}
{"text":"Came here on a whim because I was craving shawarma. Holy!!! Their chicken shawarma is delicious. Don't be fooled by the exterior, they're a very clean restaurant with amazing service."}
{"text":"I used to go all the time and it was very good when they first opened . Unfortunately the quality went down hill soon after and I stopped going after about 10 disappointing meals .. Much better middle eastern food out there try safra grill and some others ... Even Hannas is better ..."}
{"text":"Ive always been a fan of good shawarma and falafel but unfortunately even though the middle eastern population in toronto is quite large, there arent many contenders. Orly really changes that. My office used to be in the area and I would go there for a chicken shawarm pita religiously (at least 3 times a week). The chicken is always fresh (they usually run out after lunch time and pop on a new skewer of chicken). Pita's are delieverd fresh each day (ive seen the delivery guy many times) and the condiments and toppings are all uniquely fresh and delicious. One must remember that shawarmas and what is considered middle eastern varies by region, ie: iraqi is different then iranian is deifferent then georgian is different then turkish, this style is definitely more armenian/georgian style.   Value wise, it is too cheap. I often ask sasha the main shawarma maker to give me less chicken, its just too much meat for me to handle. I think my average lunch costs $5.65. Portions are massive, everything else on the menu is awesome (kebob's are unbelievable, sides are unbelieveable, my dad can eat a whole serving of rice just plain).   Go there, it is the best in toronto hands down"}
{"text":"Not a great place to stay and eat in but the food is amazing! The garlic sauce makes everything even better. All the food is fresh but the salad is nothing to write home about."}
{"text":"Solid 3.  Good shawarma pita at a good price ($4.99 plus tax).  Friendly service.  There's not much else available at Bathurst and Sheppard, so this is a good option."}
{"text":"Found this place randomly. Super helpful and nice staff. I had the large shawarma meat plate and wife had the small falafel plate. Both were very big portions, great value and tasty! I'll definitely find myself back here when I'm in the area."}
{"text":"This place has one of the best chicken and beef skewers in the area; very juicy and large portions. I'm surprised its pretty quiet. One of my favorite sides is the potatoes and the hummus."}
{"text":"Yummy food and friendly service we had chicken kebobs with home potatoes and loved the garlic and BBQ sauces. Good prices too. The pickles and pita were nice to munch on while we waited for our food."}
{"text":"Simpy one of the best I have ever had.  The falafel was unmatched, servered with some spicy hummus.  Be sure to try the Harcho soup, a lamb based soup.  The Kebobs are awesome, juicy and flavorful.  Best in the City"}
{"text":"Chicken Shawarma is deliciously seasoned and cooked on a rotisserie to perfection. Mediterranean style yellow rice is nothing short of amazing. Potatoes are perfectly crisp tossed in an irresistible garlic sauce. Have it topped with onion, garlic sauce and hot sauce and enjoy! Plus the portion size is huge compared to their very reasonable prices."}
{"text":"As a frequent customer here I've come to realize that this place makes some of the best chicken kabobs I've ever had. The rice isn't bad either!   This place always seems so not busy when I come.. Sometimes it's completely empty when I run in to grab my pre-ordered food. But rest assured, it's not because of the food.   This place honestly does the chicken perfect in my books every single time. Flavourful and juicy, cooked to perfection.   There sometimes is a bit of a language barrier when placing orders, I believe the owner is Russian, but it doesn't stop me from returning for the good food."}
