{"text":"Went there for lunch and was a bit disappointed. 
Good points : super nice service, cool places, not so many tables so it's never \"crowded\" or too noisy. 
Bad points : It is a bit overpriced for the quality and the smell of grease from the kitchen sticks to you after you leave.

Will give it another shot though !"}
{"text":"We had the 10-course dinner tasting menu and found the entire experience delightful and delicious. The flavor combinations were unexpected--e.g. galangal foam, foie gras ice cream with charcoal meringue--but mostly really well balanced. The  main ingredients of each dish were uniformly high-quality. The wine pairing combination was thoughtful and balanced nicely with the mix of courses. We walked out very full, but not uncomfortable. Can't wait to return."}
{"text":"I had dinner at that restaurant on Friday night. I had high expectations about this place. I wish we could have the half star options, because I would have rated it 3,5 stars.

The place is a medium space, cute decoration, not over the top. 

The service was great, the staff is very nice and the Chef even came out and talked to us and told us about his precious work experiences under different chefs, asked us how we liked our experience and explained brieftly how he executed some of his meals.

Food wise: We ordered the 5 meals courses, which is 54$/person. I wanted so much more for this dinner, unfortunately, my expectations were not entirely met. 

They first offered us dumplings which were filled with some Mexican cactus plant. It was OK, but nothing to write home about. 

Then we had a radish salad, which was beautiful, the presentation was exceptional, but the taste was just OK. I found that if you mix the two sauces together and dip the radish pieces in it, it would taste better. 

Afterward, we got the fish, which was sturgeon. It was EXCELLENT. Although it was a small piece, the taste was amazing, I loved it and wished I could have a bit more.

We followed  with the duck breast, which had been cooked in coffee. It was very good also. It was cooked perfectly. Not overcook, just tender enough.

Afterward, we had the pork. It was crispy and tender and the same time. The pork was covered by dark chocolate sauce. The chef explained that the pork was crispy and tender and the same time, because he used different cooking methods on the pork, including the sous-vide method. I loved the pork, but hated the dark chocolate sauce. I am not a fan of dark chocolate. I though it gave the pork a weird taste. I wish the sauce was on the side, so people could dipped in it if wanted. Otherwise, I wish there were some puree on the side such as a sweet potatoes puree.

We then had a palette cleanser, which was a great touch, because it let us really fully enjoyed the dessert afterward.

The dessert was AMAZING, the Fieldstone, which was some home made foie gras ice green covered by some charcoal meringue. The presentation was beautiful and the taste was great! 

Overall, all the meals had great presentations, the service was awesome, some of the meals were misses for me and that's why I would rate this place a 3,5 stars. This is a fairly new restaurant, so I hope it will improve on its weaker points and keep going strong on their strong points"}
{"text":"This place is amazing. I had the luck to be walking by it and was intrigued by its simple decor. It was an overwhelmingly unique experience. The tasting menu is like nothing I've ever tried before. If you're by the neighborhood be sure to check it out! Can't recommend it more!"}
{"text":"What a wonderful experience we had at Fieldstone for dinner. I had a friend visiting from NYC and wanted to have a special night between friends. That is exactly what we had. The wine list was consice and exactly what we wanted. We went for the 8 course tasting menu and we were blown away. Our table had some food requirements like one vegan and one vegetarian and 2 eat-everything-eaters. The chef treated us like premiere guests. Each one of us had unforgettable food journeys. The food was some of the best most creative dishes I have ever had. This is just simply one of the best restaurants in the city! We had ingredients we have never heard of, we looked at food presentation we had never seen, we enjoyed flavour combinations we've never thought of. The personal touches by the chef and team only enhanced the experience for us. This is not just food but it is also discovery, a lesson, and an experience. Bravo"}
{"text":"Brilliant, local, fresh, creative fare. The value (delectable 4-course meal) for money ($46) is unbeatable. I can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"There was so much hype surrounding this restaurant that I had to give it a try. I came here on a weekday with my fiancé and the place was completely empty. The waiters only had us to focus on so the service was impeccable, albeit a bit cold. 

We ordered the 5 and 8-course tasting menu. I have pictures of what we ate but honestly I don't remember much because it wasn't very memorable. It tasted good though, it just wasn't mind-blowing. I enjoyed the kimchi dumplings. And I do remember that their signature dessert the Fieldstone was out of this world. Foie gras ice cream and charcoal meringue- I would come back just for this and a glass of wine."}
{"text":"Came here for the 8-course dinner tasting menu and I loved every moment of our meal. 
It was a quiet Wednesday night, and there was only one other party, so we received quite the intimate dining experience. My friends were bold enough to ask for a kitchen visit, where we got to meet chef Chanthy Yen and the team. They were extremely welcoming and we had a great conversation about the culinary club we run at Mcgill. Service was extremely friendly and unpretentious. Our friend had to leave because of issues with her dog, and they were extremely accommodating in pacing the rest of our dishes and saving the entrees for those who had to leave and return. 
Anyways, we started off with an amuse bouche of kimchi and cactus dumplings, and we also ordered the squid and morcilla starter to share. I WOULD get into the details of each dish we had, but I can confirm that I thoroughly enjoyed every single one of the dishes.
We were served the spring menu, which included: Radish salad, mussels, roasted carrots, halibut ceviche, duck breast, beef cheek, a palate cleanser of stewed apples, blue corn custard, and lastly a fois gras ice cream. 
My personal favourites were the roasted carrots and beef cheeks. The caraway sauce and the hemp riccotta complimented the carrots perfectly, with a bit of grapefruit to add a touch of tartness. The extremely tender beef cheeks were accompanied with a roasted parsnip puree, with a strong mustard sauce you can add to your liking. 
Their menu descriptions include the prominent spices and flavours you will get in each dish, where you see the influences from cambodia and latin america. There was a great use of local ingredients as well, such as the seabuckthorn berries. I found that each ingredient worked cohesively in the flavours and texture; there was nothing that didn't have a purpose in creating a more complex and delicious dish.
The meal progressed in a way that they ease you into the heavier meat dishes slowly, and transitioned into dessert seamlessly.  
All in all, I would definitely recommend everyone to try this out. The tasting menu is $65 for 8 courses, which is an AMAZING deal for the calibre of food they serve. We were there for about 4 hours and I didn't even notice because I had great food and great company."}
{"text":"I came in for brunch on their opening and had the confit salmon with blue corn cakes. The salmon was cooked perfectly and the eggs were incredible. I had never had a blue corn cake before but it blew me away. I would highly recommend the smoothie as well!"}
{"text":"Lol! Ok, I'm starting to feel like I'm stalking this restaurant as I was just here last weekend for brunch and came back AGAIN this weekend 

This time we took a friend's mom visiting from out of town and boy she loved it!!! As usual, the staff is super courteous and helpful, always making sure our needs are met and that my gluten-free request is taken good care of.

We took the daily special (which was a braised beef cheek), the avocado toast, another avocado toast with gluten free chufa bread, the daikon salad and obviously, the Fieldstone dessert. 

Everything was delicious. The avocado toasts had a lemony kick in the sauce, which balanced out the fatty chunks of avocado really nicely. The beef was fork tender and perfectly seasoned. I'm not gonna describe the foie gras ice cream again though as it would be so redundant in my case"}
{"text":"I think my expectations were too high for this place. 
I came here on a Saturday night with my brother and my boyfriend. We all did the 8 course tasting menu for $69. It was good but it didn't not blow my mind. For me it's between a 3 and 4 star. It's good but not amazing. 

We started off with free vegetarian dumplings. That's was very nice of them to bring! It had kimchi inside. 

I got a glass of Chianti and the guys got beer.

First we got the pear and radish. I don't like radish but this wasn't as bitter as I expected. The pear was nice but for me, what made the dish good was the grated cheese sprinkled all over the plate.  There was a lot of it. 

Second came the carrots with a purée of some kind and ricotta on the side . Third came the scallop crudo. It was good but salty. I liked that they included dill. 

Fourth was the beetroot tartare. It's very smoky!  I liked it but my boyfriend didn't like it right away and took some getting used to. It really does taste like you are eating at a campfire. 

Then came the duck. I liked the skin and the fat but felt the sauce was a bit too lemony. My boyfriend found it chewy and would have preferred if it was cut up thinly instead. 

This was followed by the braised beef. This was our favourite dish of the night! The meat melted in our mouths and the sauce had a bit of curry in it.  After this they gave us a piece of apple cooked in rose water to cleanse the palate.

The desserts were good and light! We had the blue corn custard. I honestly don't know why it's called that. I had no idea what I was eating but did recognize some strawberries. Lol Lastly came the foie gras ice cream. It was so good! It didn't taste like foie gras and I probably never would have guessed. I liked the mix of the crispy layer on top with the ice cream. 

The dishes were beautifully plated and they were very innovative. I felt like there was a lot of veggies. It was good. There was nothing I really didn't like but would I come back ? Hmmm probably not. I've had better tasting menus elsewhere."}
{"text":"SO GOOOOOOOD

I usually don't review after only one visit, however, I ordered a 5-course tasting menu (Canadian, Cambodian, Mexican influences) regretted not getting the 8-course tasting after my 2nd course, picked up the darn scallop shell to suck down all the sauce on the 3rd course then started furiously texting someone to HURRY UP and ditch work to join me, only to have her show up after I finished my  5th course whereupon I asked the server for another menu so she could get the good stuff too, but the scallop dish wasn't on the regular menu so could they please add that (yes, chef said. How nice!) and then she got a full size app, entree, and dessert I didn't have, so I got to mooch off hers (GAWD so GOOOOD) and end up trying 8 different dishes plus 2 amuse bouche anyway.

End of story: come hungry and order the whole menu w pals if you can (or just get the biggest 8-course tasting menu for yourself) before your stomach starts complaining mid-meal like mine did."}
{"text":"Loved this place, love the chef, highly recommend.

Wanted something really great and called for a dinner res. Got the chef on the phone who couldn't have been nicer. He asked about dietary issues and offered to look for something for us at the farmer's market since we were calling a day ahead. Lunch was sublime, wait staff was perfect, and we wish we lived here so we could come back more often. 

This food is exquisite and not necessarily geared to folks who like large portions. That said, my meat-hungry husband loved his sturgeon dish with foam and curry and what he called \"very complex\" flavors. He loved his pumpkin soup! As a vegan I ate really well, with two starter and two entree options. My pear and radish starter had crazy good bits of salt and toasted quinoa (?). Have never loved persimmon much but as a roasted main dish with okra it was super rich and buttery. Even my lemon verbena sorbet dessert was nutso good. 

Chef came out to check on everyone even though he is actually and literally the only person in the kitchen. 

Someone had previously mentioned a smell of grease so I was looking for that. Not only is there no smell of grease, the entire restaurant has a squeaky clean, and comfortable simplicity which puts you at ease. The kitchen is open, and everything here smells good.

Please try this place. Chef is an artist and should be recognized."}
{"text":"Really fantastic flavors and beautifully presented. This young chef has so much potential and I can't wait to try the future menu. We had the 5 course menu and I loved every bite of it up until the main course. For the main course, a few of us had more rare cuts of steak that had a very chewy tendon consistency. Across the table, we noted that the steak was cooked to different degrees and we ended swapping pieces among each other. We wished the waiter has asked us how we liked our steaks done. Also, since the portions were on the smaller side, the men at the table ended up hungry by the end of the meal, forcing us to make a pit stop somewhere else before heading home. 

Overall, I really did enjoy the experience. I think the portions were just enough, but others may find that the 8 course menu would fill them up a little more. I would be happy to return again in the future to see how the menu evolves."}
{"text":"Wow. Chef Chanthy Yen prepared a work of art. Between visually stunning presentation and innovative preparations, the protege of Ferran Adria at elBulli shows his chops. Starting with gaotze filled with kimchee was subtle. Squash soup with roasted pumpkin seeds followed with rich and complex flavors. Sturgeon in Cambodian curry was satifying. The dessert of foie gras icecream was a visually stunning. It looked like it belonged in MOMA. My wife's vegan main course of roasted persimmon presented a symphony of flavors whiched played in sequence over my palate.
Chef Yen has arrived."}
