{"text":"I wanted to like this place, I really did. This venue has SO much potential, especially with a name like 'Mad Mac's'. Now, with any new business there is always gonna be some bumps. I guess I was expecting a 'Melt' type atmosphere, with the same ideas of 'Hefty Mac and cheese meals'. My partner and I were left severly dissapointed with our meals. Almost $9 for 6 Mac and cheese wedges, which were VERY small in size. Not what I had envisioned at all for that price. We figured our meals would make up for our appetizer, but we were so wrong. I hate to say this, but the food we were served we could easily have made in our own kitchen at home. I ordered the cheeseburger macaroni and cheese and it was basically just hamburger helper with some tomatoes and parsley. Very underwhelming. Portions weren't the biggest either :/ My partner got the three cheese, which didn't even resemble macaroni and cheese it was basically just a pasta salad type dish with cheese thrown on top. I'm not sure if we'll be giving this place a second chance, but like I said there's always room for improvement. The staff and bartender we had were very polite, so I'll give credit there! Again, I cannot stress enough just how much potential this place has to be something GREAT just like Melt bar and grilled. C' Mon guys make Lakewood proud!!!!"}
{"text":"We ordered the fried pickles to start. It is amazing that they serve it with ranch and hot sauce since I never thought this combo would be as amazing as it was. We ordered the Ryan Reynolds Exploding Ding Dong along with the Paradise City drink. We shared everything. The drinks were solid. Got the garden salad, typical salad with a twist - breadcrumbs on top. Please request ranch instead of Italian dressing. Ordered chicken bacon ranch and the hot dog mac and cheese. Both were amazing and make sure you top the hot dog one with ranch as well. I can't wait to come back again!!! 

Parking is so easy too."}
{"text":"Stopped in for the first time.  Mac and cheese dishes were excellent.  Have to get used to the self serve aspect.  Would have preferred a waiter/waitress.  Will be back to try another dish."}
{"text":"We enjoyed our first visit to Mad Mac's! It is apparent there are still some kinks to work out but that comes with all new openings! When we came in we were advised that we ordered food at the hostess stand and drinks at the bar, then picked a table where both items would be delivered to us. Ordering from the bar for drinks made it a little silly to get another drink mid conversation, which kept us from ordering another. Our food came out hot and very fast, which we appreciated! The honey sriracha cheese sticks were just store bought mozzarella sticks with a little bit of sauce on them... but the Mac and cheese was great! Better then what I could make at home. Paying was a little confusing too, and I left not knowing who my tip would go to and wasn't sure if tipping was necessary based on the 4 different people that interacted with us on our visit. I can't wait to visit Mad Mac's again and see how they grow as they continue to serve more patrons!"}
{"text":"Full bar, friendly service and delicious mac & cheese. Vegan options are available.  Great for a late night stop!"}
{"text":"Like the concept a lot. The chicken bacon ranch mac and cheese was excellent. Nice portions. Friendly staff, nice vibe!"}
{"text":"Great macaroni and cheese restaurant. Nice bar. Really comfortable space. Friendly staff. I had the Chicken Bacon Ranch and the garlic bread and both were excellent. 3 dollar draft beer. Definitely coming back to try the other options on the menu."}
{"text":"I really wanted to LOVE this place. I would definitely come again, but probably just for drinks. 
Pros: friendly staff, reasonably priced drinks, good spot to watch a game
Con: I ordered the Italian 3 cheese Mac with \"keto cauliflower\" instead of pasta. Keto is a diet, not a cauliflower so it was a little confusing & the bartender didn't know either. Came out cold. The \"Italian\" part was just raw Italian seasoning thrown on top. I love the cauliflower option but the execution needs work."}
{"text":"Let me start off by saying...I'm NOT picky...or a food snob...just a foodie who loves trying new places to eat! I also have to disclose that one of the things I've mastered in the kitchen is a homemade mac & cheese that is requested at every event/family party/holiday/etc. 

My boyfriend is a Mac & Cheese fanatic...however this place was pretty disappointing. He got the Creamy Homestyle and I got the Brie & Cracker...it was the same Mac & cheese just with different toppings. I think if I was drunk at midnight I would have loved this...but I probably wouldn't go here again as Lakewood has SO MANY other great options for food...and to be honest I would prefer boxed Velveeta for $2 rather than a poorly thought out $10 plate of subpar mac. We both left wishing we would have chosen one of our go to's. 

The concept of this place is awesome, the atmosphere is perfect, the music was great...but the food was less than stellar. The service was fast, but mostly because we had to walk up to the bar to get our drinks, refills, to order, etc. I will come back once this place is more established and hope they change things up a bit...especially get a separate receipe for each mac rather than using the same one and haphazardly throwing some toppings on it."}
{"text":"I wasn't as impressed as I genuinely wanted to be with this cool concept restaurant. Hubs and I are fried food addicts/connoisseurs, so naturally we split the pickle chips- they were just your basic bar food variety, but the ranch sauce was fantastic. I ordered the Italian 3 Cheese mac and my excitement quickly dissipated when I saw how small the portion was for the price. It was just very \"meh\" and I didn't leave feeling like I got my money's worth for such #basic noodles and cheese."}
{"text":"Ate here last night with the family. Had tomato bisque, House salad, vegan salad, fried pickle chips, and 5 kinds of Mac & cheese: hotdog, cheeseburger, chicken bacon ranch, 3 cheese Italian and vegan. 

First the fried pickles aren't your typical spears or standard chips. They obviously cut a whole pickle into chips and fried them to crispy perfection. So soggy coating here. 

Then the Mac and cheese : all of them were delicious but my fav was absolutely the vegan version with house made cashew cream. It was decadent without being heavy. The older kids loved the cheeseburger and the 5 yr old was full at half the hotdog version. Food comes out fast and hot. 

Oh then there's the drinks. We had a Paradise City and a One Time at Band Camp. Both were yummy but neither felt too heavy with alcohol but even with the food we could feel the single drink. Hmmm

Thanks Mad Mac's for a nice neighborhood joint to go to, now if you were only in my neighborhood so I could walk
And then have 2 drinks!"}
