{"text":"I'm a pizza lover. I don't mean any kind of pizza, I mean, real, authentic wood fired pizza with quality ingredients. Yes, I'm a pizza snob. I've had a clear favorite pizza place for a while, but I think it's now been overthrown by the pizza at Piatti. It.Is. F*#%ing. Excellent!  It's got a nice crust. Not quite as chewy as the pizza at Bottega but light and tasty. They have a good number of toppings and the size of the pie is ideal. I'm partial to margherita pizzas (no matter where I eat my pizza), but the sopressata and rapini pizza was excellent as well.  All the other dishes coming out of the kitchen all looked better than the next. It's a nice restaurant, so I suggest cleaning up before going. I'll definitely be going back."}
{"text":"Great Ambiance and excellent food make this a \"drive out of your way\" restaurant. The pizza is top notch; my wife prefers it to Bottegas. I'm giving it 4 stars ' cause the service is sllllowwww. I mean don't make plans for afterword's because you're going to be here for a while. Usually takes us almost 2 hours for dinner. But man the food is good."}
{"text":"The food here is absolutely delicious! Homemade pastas were amazing! Friendly attentive service. Vegetarian options available as well. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"l mio preferito!  Piatti is for me one of those classics when I am looking for class, great food and ambiance. It is a little expensive but like I always tell my mom..nowadays you eat at chain restaurants for about 20-30$ ... and sometimes  it is crap!  I rather pay 10$ extra to have fine Italian cuisine!  And it is a perfect restaurant for nice business lunches!  Chi voi andare con me?  ---  l mio preferito!  Piatti est l'un de ces classiques lorsque je cherche classe, bonne bouffe et une belle ambiance. Un peu cher oui, mais comme je dis souvent à ma mère, de nos jour sles restos de chaîne nous coûtent 25-30$ et c'est parfois de la merde!   J'aime mieux payer 10$ extra et avoir de la cuisine italienne fine.  Et c'est un resto parfait pour des lunch d'affaires!  Chi voi andare con me?"}
{"text":"Good place!  I've personally had better but it was very good! This is the first Restaurant where there was NO GRATED Cheese offered at anytime.  Not for my Stracciatella Soup not for my neighbor's Spaghetti dish.  I had the Stracciatella, it was missing a little something.  The cheese would have helped a lot but was not offered and the waiter was hard to get a hold of. They seemed to be short handed for the Quantity of people. I also had the Calabrese Pizza it too was missing a little something.  I think my expectations were too high for what I received.  It was good just not as good as I was expecting for the price I paid."}
{"text":"Came here on a Monday night when the place was a bit slow, so service was pretty prompt and attentive. The atmosphere is very nice. We had the potato leek soup, sausage tortellini and mushroom ravioli. Everything was quite good, though a little bit on the salty side. Still, I'd come back again. Prices were reasonable and the food was good."}
{"text":"Service was good; however, the steak was over salted I think it was old meat and they spiced it up to kill the old taste. Was not feeling very well after. Heard good reviews, gave it a try, and had a huge disappointment ... would not come back"}
