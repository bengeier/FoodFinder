{"text":"Not sure what all the hype is about. We had a friend in town and were excited to try a new restaurant. Everything was extremely bland - I thought this was an Indian restaurant? Drinks were underwhelming and 85% ice. The decor is tacky (although the ceiling is cool). There is this weird partition with holes in it, great for customers waiting for their tables to stare at you while you enjoy an intimate dinner! And then the bill came! Not only was it extremely overpriced, we had to wait forever to pay the server - by that time we really wanted out of there! Montreal is a city full of amazing restaurants - don't waste your time on this one!"}
{"text":"Awesome lunch spot in St-Henri! Terrific menu -- everything on it sounds delicious. I had the thali plate, which was excellent. The staff were really friendly and attentive. Prices are reasonable. I'll be back for sure."}
{"text":"The food tastes nice and was cooked well. Ordered the chilli paneer which was delicious. The tandoori tikka paneer is great as well. However, my only complaint is that the portions are really small."}
{"text":"Horrific. From start to finish a travesty of a dining experience. Being referred to as guys, fellas, boys, gents and les gars by a waiter who is ten years younger than the youngest at table, ca fait mal. 

Being asked 'How about starting with some appys boys?' brought to mind the worst chain restaurants and this brand of overly familiar service persisted until he was too embarassed even to come to the table because the drinks and then the food took forever. 

The food: over priced, overwrought,  unimaginative, tepid and unfulfilling.

This place was so bad the hashtags on display on many of the surfaces in the dining room almost inspired three non-twitterers to open twitter accounts just to be able to trash the place.

If you live in St Henri spend the money on a cab, go up to Jean Talon, eat like a king, get in another cab to come home and still come out on top."}
{"text":"I walked in on a whim with a friend from Toronto after we were given the cold shoulder at the burgundy lion.

Everything was perfect from the start . Rex was an amazing host and the wait staff were attentive and friendly(shout out to Val). 

We loved the food suggested by Rex and will definitely be back for more. Thanks for making my out of town friend feel at home. Great job, great food."}
{"text":"Fabuleux!  
Meilleur resto Indien à Montréal!  Atmosphère génial.  
Salon privé vraiment parfait!
Le service était impeccable, rapide et personnalisé.
J'ai mangé les meilleurs lampchop korma ever!!!
Nous reviendrons c'est certain!
Merci!!!"}
{"text":"Cute little place. Very good prices. Smells delicious when you enter ."}
{"text":"Almost perfect, but not quite so! I love their indian fusion cuisine! The tuna tartar with an indian twist- very exciting! Butter chicken is just the best in town. However some items on the menu are just little better then average, thus a 4star. Nevertheless we love going to rasoi. 
Almost forgot NEVER take their doughnuts soaked in something like \"rose\" water (not sure, see the menu). It was close to one of the most horrible things that i tasted!!!"}
{"text":"We ate brunch there today and the food delicious! The ambience and decor are really nice and the service is friendly and efficient....especially our server, Gage. He knew a lot about the dishes which was really helpful. I highly recommend this restaurant, particularly the brunch!"}
{"text":"Amazing food, atmosphere, and waitstaff. Great, charismatic executive chef who checked in on our table to ensure we were satisfied. The food is absolutely delicious (we got channa masala, chilli paneer, coconut seafood curry, goat vindaloo, garlic naan, and bhatura). Also yummy drinks. We will definitely be back each time we're in Montreal!"}
{"text":"Went to this spot at lunch time. There were only a few people so me  and my friend could  choose our sits...I would suggest the side benches they'll give you a full view of the restaurant. The decor is warm and very colorful, get ready for nice trip to modern India. I had the curry chick Thali  which I highly recommend , the flavours and textures everything was there. Very good price value for the quality of the food. So enjoy !"}
{"text":"Background: I visited Montreal for a week and was pretty much open to eating and trying anything. I've never been disappointed with Indian food so I decided to try this place! As my appetizer, I had lamb poutine. As my entree, I had garlic naan with chicken tikka masala. 

Pros

1. Friendly and welcoming staff
2. Not a long wait time to be seated
3. Great ambiance 
4. Comfortable seating 

Cons

1. Food took a while to come out (35+ mins)
2. Basmati rice does not come with your meal 

Overall: Everything was GREAT. Although I love lamb I was very hesitant on trying the lamb poutine for many reasons. But since poutine is on the Montreal \"must eat\" list, I couldn't allow myself to leave without trying. I ate it and definitely could've eaten another plate. Lamb was made to perfection. The right amount of gravy (not too little and not too much) and the cheese curds was also a perfection additional. The garlic naan was fresh and extremely tasty. The chicken tikka masala was tender, juicy, and made with soooooooo much LOVEEEE. Do note that if you want rice, you have to order it separately. It does not come with your meal. I would highly recommend this place!!"}
{"text":"The decor is ok, but more attention could be put on the decor around the bar! Was a fan since day one, nonetheless, the service isn't always the best and its hard to find waiter who speak proper French! They have good fusion food, until i discovered that they dont make it from scratch! They use prepared sauces and mixes that you can buy at your local grocery store, so i was a bit disappointed. I guess i wound be going there anymore."}
{"text":"Great food .. Great service .. 
Very nice place too 
Had 8 different items on the menu ... And we could not complaints on anything 
Good twist on the Poutine too"}
{"text":"i was very happy with this place. the food was delicious: onion bhaji, chili paneer and butter chicken. none of it was too sweet and in fact, the flavours were nice and the paneer had a nice heat. The garlic naan was nice as well and freshly baked. I would totally recommend this place. the service was also good."}
{"text":"It's refreshing to walk into an Indian restaurant and be wowed by the design of the place; first impression on point! 

Our waitress was energetic, extremely helpful in providing suggestions, and very friendly. The time it took between getting the menus and being able to put our order through was a little long, but the overall experience more than made up for it.

The food was DELICIOUS. There were 4 of us, and we got to try about 7 different dishes, each equally impressive, flavourful and satisfying. The tandoori chicken on sizzling plate with rum-marinated pineapple was definitely a highlight. 

It was a great setting for a dinner with friends; perfectly noisy and cozy. Overall quality to price ratio is among the best I've seen in this kind of restaurant. It came out to around 25$ each before tip and drinks, which is more than reasonable. I definitely recommend!"}
{"text":"We got delivery with Foodora. Came right on time. The garlic naan was excellent. Butter chicken was good, but I've had richer flavouring before. The poutine was unique and very flavourful. Would order again!"}
{"text":"Dreadful. 

Boring, overpriced food, obnoxious servers, and creepy management. Caught the owner lewdly gazing at my girlfriend. Not my favourite dining experience!"}
{"text":"Dans la série des cuisines fusions, Rasoï nous propose un service façon tapas donc plats à partager.
Globalement rien à redire :
- cadre chaleureux et enveloppant
- service sympathique et efficace
- plats bien exécutés et bien présentés
- cocktails un peu léger en alcool

J'en suis rendu à mettre 3 étoiles car je trouve le tout assez dispendieux pour une cuisine certes bonne mais sans découverte ou ré découverte de la cuisine indienne.
J'ai déjà dégusté ces plats à des tarifs bien plus abordables avec tout autant de qualité et de quantité.

La mode des \" tapas \" plats à partager touche un nombre grandissant de restaurants à Montréal facturant au prix fort de petites pièces.

Je reconnais qu'il y a un menu avec des plats individuels que je n'ai pas goûté mais qui mériterait de l'être.

Rasoï reste un bon restaurant avec une ambiance intimiste et chaleureuse. Expérience à renouveler pour forger mon opinion sur d'autres plats (autre que tapas)."}
{"text":"Was invited here for a double date as it is a well known fact I like/know Indian food.  I really liked the atmosphere and the upscale casual feel for the place. The music was very nice too and at  the right volume. Ordered cocktails and was immediately drawn to Hot Lips for its spicy ingredients. But alas, it fell short on both punch and bite. Ordered 4-5 bunch of typical indian appetizers and they were all pretty good. Followed up with typical indian main courses. Overall the food is best described as 'indian food for beginners'  Flavors were muted and kept very conservative. Not very spicy nor very imaginative, but good healthy sized portions and we left satisfied. Finished off with the Gulab Jaman. No, not the best indian food you will have, but a good place to take the unitiated for a nice evening out. You want the real deal and authentic flavors go elsewhere. But this was a decent spot for a casual meal. Not cheap, but a pleasant dinner spot with introductory Indian cuisine."}
{"text":"J'ai passé un bon moment à Rasoi. Une belle découverte, j'ai été ébloui par la déco qui fusionne modernité et traditions. Le principal: les plats, excellents. J'ai dévoré chacun de mes choix. C'est un tantinet dispandieux mais on en sort ravi."}
{"text":"Last night was our first time at Rasoi.  We've been to Tequila Bar a few times (and loved it) and thought we would check out the owner's brother's place up the street.  The decor is colourful and funky cool.  The wait staff was friendly and knowledgeable and very attentive.   The food was very flavourful, cooked with skill, and beautiful.  We enjoyed the creative Indian-Thai fusion options and appreciated it being served tapas style (so we could try five different things).  The mango salad, street spring rolls, and 65 chicken (special that day....not positive at the name) were big standouts to us!  We kept commenting on the great flavours and textures in each!   All of these were A+ dishes.  The goat vindaloo and an eggplant dish were very tasty and solid items, but we felt they were as good as the dishes from our favourite places we go to.  We look forward to coming back and ordering some of these again and trying some new items!   Neither of us are into poutine, but that lamb poutine caught our eye for a future trip.  I must make mention that the mango mojito was fresh, vibrant, and, happily not overly-sweet (like you often get in the states.).  You can tell that both Rasoi and Tequila Bar were created with lots of thought, love, and a passion for good food, great atmosphere, and quality service.  Thumbs up!"}
{"text":"We had a great experience at Rasoi. We dined in for ladies night where ladies receive a free appetizer and entree with the purchase of a bottle of wine between two people. The bottles included in this Wednesday deal start at $50.00 - so shared you're looking at $25.00 each. 

Food: Excellent. I started with the fish pakoras which were served like classic fish and chips (in a newspaper with kettle cooked chips). They didn't skimp on the amount of fish included in the pakoras and the batter and filling were flavourful and delicious. I then went with the Fig, Basil and Paneer naan pizza. They were able to lock down delicious Indian flavours on the pizza while still allowing the toppings to shine and work together to make a delicious plate!

Service was great! Our waiters were attentive, helpful and patient to a table of seven girls!

How dare I forget the decor. Beautiful! Whoever designed the interior of the restaurant  should take a trip to my apartment and decorate!

Definitely a solid choice in St Henri"}
{"text":"Lorsque vous entrerez dans ce restaurant votre esprit sera transporté dans un environnement indien enchanteur ! 


La nourriture est de grande qualité et j'y ai dégusté une pizza au figues  et au fromage paneer plus qu' excellente. Vous vous sentirez à l'aise dans ce bon restaurant au décor fin ! 

C'est le meilleur restaurant Indien à Montréal et si vous désirer gouter la meilleure nourriture indienne avec un très bon service,  faites-vous une faveur et essayer ce restaurant !





when i enter in this restaurant the decoration will takes your mind in a little trip to India.

The food is as good as the decoration and they do takes chances. we taste a delicious paneer cheese  and fresh fig pizza that was tasteful and new !

You will find yourself at ease in this nice restaurant and i think it's fair to say that it's one of the best Indian restaurant in Montreal ! We also taste the curry chicken and it was very good. The service is as good as the food !

This restaurant is in a class all by himself, and if you want to taste the best Indian food in town with a excellent service , this is the place to try !"}
{"text":"They had really good lamb curry. I also enjoyed their mango cocktail a lot. The place is expensive and if you want some authentic Indian food, maybe this restaurant isn't the ideal choice. But this place is good for fusion-Indian and it's a good place to be with friends."}
{"text":"A wonderful addition to this fast growing St Henri neighborhood. This is Indian fusion food and not for people expecting the \"traditional\" menu. They do a wonderful job blending traditional with modern. It's an eclectic menu with freshly prepared food a friendly, chill vibe. 

We went for an early-ish dinner (6PM) so it wasn't too crowded and were able to snag an outdoor table. The mango salad was terrific (but be warned: even though the menu says it comes with tuna, what they don't tell you is that they charge you an extra $6 unless you tell them you don't want it). 

Nice curries, freshly cooked naan, great appetizers too. Definitely worth a stop here. 

Be patient tho -- the food takes awhile (cause it's fresh!). So enjoy a beer or a drink, talk to the people you're with and relax!"}
{"text":"Location not bad. 
Ambience great with nice decor. 
Price is reasonable. 
Food was nice, flavorful. Not really \"fusion\" however you can see attempts at that in some of the dishes. Butter chicken was a bit loose. Onion Bhaji, California Naan, and goat vindaloo were great choices. 

As you may have noticed in previous reviews there is issues with service. Our waiter was not very helpful and at times flat out rude."}
{"text":"Location: On Notre-Dame West, a few minutes away from the Lionel-Groulx station. Street parking is available but metered. You may find free parking in some of the partially zoned areas (residential) but check the signage. 

The place: I LOVED the Indian-ispired decor: gorgeous brick walls, beautiful furniture + lighting, and the large sculpture of Ganesha complete the look and offer up a warm and cozy atmosphere. Let's not forget those crazy colourful ceilings, either!

The food: After reading great reviews, I'd bookmarked Rasoi as a place to try. When the opportunity arose to do lunch with a friend, we decided to stop in. Having had two breakfasts (OK, don't judge), I kept my order small - I went with the Tuna Tartar [on mango and avocado served with a spiced mango puree and tortilla chips]. There was nothing Indian about this dish at all. Now, did I know this when I ordered? Yes. However, I expected this wouldn't matter since I'm a big fan of literally, all the above ingredients. While the presentation was pretty, the food itself was bland. I'm talking zero use of seasoning or spices, here. There's only so much you can do with raw tuna, but avocado and mango? You can totally spice/flavour that sh*t up. I'm not sure if the tortillas were store-bought or homemade, but they were also lacking in flavour. My side of naan was good but again, the flavour was missing. On the flip side, my friend ordered the vegetarian Thali and loved it. I could smell the amazing flavours emanating from her dish and regretted not ordering the same thing. The onion Bhaji was great, as were the chick peas. There was Basmati and naan served with this dish, along with a few other things that I don't recall - my date seriously enjoyed everything but the pickled carrots. I had a taste and I'm not sure if these guys were pickled in wine or cider but umm, no. Totally didn't work. 

Service: Under normal circumstances, this is where I would dock stars but our waiter was alone on the floor, and the place literally filled up right after we arrived.  I'm sure Rasoi staffs accordingly during rush hour, but it was unfortunate to see our poor server running around trying to cater to everyone, while apologizing repeatedly for delays. 

Price point: Depends what you order - my Tartar (it was an appetizer not a main) + naan was $20 with tax. The Thali ranges between $15-$21 though I'm not sure why. I'm going to presume this has to do with whether or not there's meat involved...."}
{"text":"Have been there four times, one of them I celebrated my birthday with a group of 30 people. Twice I went for brunch. It shows I enjoy that restaurant. The decor is colorful and beautiful. The ambiance is fun. Good choice of music. Service is good, with always good recommendations. The food isn't typical Indian. The fusion of Indian food make the experience more exciting. Favorite dish fig paneer pizza for dinner, lunch or breakfast...it is a must to try. Love the hot lips drink... ou la la!"}
{"text":"Dined here with friends and thoroughly enjoyed the flavours, smells environment of this place. the service was very friendly and the prices reasonable.  Our orders were taken in a timely fashion and delivered hot very tasteful."}
{"text":"This place was a really pleasant surprise. I booked the table by the window at the request of my friend. The ambiance definitely gets full points! It has a traditional vibe with large paintings of Indian women with a lounge-like feel. Very upscale and modern with a tasteful amount of Indian culture. The doors leading into the dining room are grand and the wall by the bar is made of rice bags and oh so cool. The bathrooms downstairs are also very nice. If you're looking for an Indian restaurant that has proper cloth napkins and cutlery (not like the typical plastic plates and paper napkins) take a reservation here. 
The food is an ode to the chef's Indian heritage with a western twist. All the dishes have some kind of twist. We started with venison samosa and the onion bhaji- both mediocre. The samosa could use more spice and cilantro or mint. For our main meals, we tried the chipotle chicken tikka masala, the goat curry, the chili paneer, and the baighan with naan. Everything was delicious but some of the dishes didn't feel authentic to the title. For instance, the chicken was a cross between chicken jalfrezi and something with chipotle smokiness, but nothing really like tikka masala. I liked the planner best because it had a good spiciness to it. My partner liked the baighan most and it really was far better than the one I make. 
To end our meal, we shared a gulab jamun. Gummy and not like the soft gulab jamun it should have been but the presentation was nice and the scoop of ice cream was good. Also it had too much rose flavor in the syrup. I wouldn't order it again. But I think I'll be back here to try more dishes. 
My friend also had a virgin cucumber drink that was delicious, but slightly pricey. 
Overall, a good experience and decent on the wallet- we each spent about $25 (4 people) for a medium sized meal."}
{"text":"Amazing Indian fusion restaurant. I have tried a variety of their dishes and my favorite is the vindaloo...service is always exceptional as is  the food!!"}
{"text":"La nourriture est excellente. 
Le décor est très original, la musique est très bonne!! 
Par contre, le pourboire suggéré lors du paiement interact est de 17% et je n'ai pas pu le changer."}
{"text":"Just ordered from Rasoi using a delivery service (Just-eat.ca).

Butter chicken was very watery and chicken, the very little there was, was very dry.  A very unsatisfying meal for $25 with tip (butter chicken and white rice, no drink).  Delivery was 90 minutes because of a demonstration in town, even though the place is 5 minutes by car if you ask  Google Maps.

Oh, and you have to use your hands to eat as they do not deliver with utensils or even a napkin. 

Sorry, but Rasoi sucks."}
{"text":"Some may say that I travel around the world to find the best paneer. Found some! Let's just say the paneer tikka appetizer was amazing!! This is not your traditional Indian Restaurant it's fusion. For someone that loves a good traditional Indian meal this place still hit the spot. I would recommend the paneer tikka (dry) and chipotle chicken tikka masala (with gravy). The cocktails were also good and the service was exceptional! Thanks Rex and team for making our dining experience awesome!"}
{"text":"Delicious food, tasty cocktails, reasonably priced, great atmosphere and cheerful staff! Montreal needs more restos of this caliber."}
{"text":"We came to Montreal for the weekend, staying in St Henri neighborhood. We wandered down Rue Notre-Dame and stumbled upon this gem. The staff was friendly, the atmosphere was great, and the food was delicious!

I had the aubergine (eggplant) curry, which was incredible, and the drinks were tasty!

Great for travellers, families, or dates! Casual atmosphere but still classy."}
{"text":"Went there again after an amazing first time and unfortunately it will be my last. Staff was barely present as we had to continuously get up to ask for service. Food was good but not amazing. We were a table of 10 and  they had sat us near the uninsulated window where we all had to eat with our winter jackets on. We asked to be moved while the restaurant was still empty as we had 3 young children with us and the answer was no. Hopefully they step up their staff game again."}
{"text":"Excellent restaurant pour ce qui est de la qualité des plats et la fraîcheur des ingrédients.  Leur menu cocktail est également très créatif.  Service un peu inconstant d'une visite à l'autre mais somme toute adéquat.  Décor très agréable et la terrasse plutôt jolie."}
{"text":"I've wanted to review this place for a while, but I kept holding off because my experiences have varied so widely that I was never quite sure where I stood. When I've eaten in I've found the food to be quite good and fresh tasting, although the service was slow. (The last time I went we waited 45 minutes for our dinner.) However, I've had take-out now a few times, and each time the food has gotten worse. The onion bhajis are delicious in-house, but when we order for pick-up, they're extremely dry and old tasting. It has honestly left me wondering if they serve different food for take-out. Day-old bhajis? I can only speculate on the reason, but the last batch I ordered was so terrible I ended up throwing half of them out. 

Now the other dishes were tasty enough that I was still planning on returning to Rasoi (while refraining from ordering any more bhajis) when I found a piece of meat in the vegetarian dish I was eating. While this might not sound like a huge deal, to me it's indicative of a bigger problem. Does Rasoi claim to serve vegetarian/vegan meals while cooking them on unwashed equipment where they also cook meat? Is the restaurant so sloppy that someone else's food ended up in mine? I can deal with a lot of restaurant shortcomings, including slow service and a couple of mediocre dishes, but cross-contamination (due to presumably unwashed cookware) points to a lack of respect for the customer, and that's the last straw for me. Unfortunately, Rasoi has lost a couple of regular customers, and if you have any dietary restrictions or allergies or are concerned about knowing what's in your food, I would also encourage you to think twice about eating here."}
{"text":"This place is cute!!! The staff was super nice and attentive. The place was not that busy and we were seated immediately. We took our time ordering our food. I don't remember if the menu was in English but my gut was telling me it wasn't and I had to order my usual because I didn't want a surprise. The food took awhile to come out. My sister had the curry poutine and she loved it, I didn't  think it was that great to be honest.  The meal does not come with basmati rice so make sure you ask for it. I ended up get the Chicken Tikka Saag Paneer for a  appetizer and the Chicken Tikka Masala for my main course, I believe she got lamb curry, we also ordered garlic naan and regular naan. The drinks aren't strong but the food was very good and I would definitely  recommend anyone looking for Indian food in Montreal to try this place. The art is lovely and so is the staff. Great job guys!"}
{"text":"C'est par un vendredi pluvieux que j'ai décidé avec ma copine d'aller essayer ce nouveau restaurant indien cuisine fusion du sud ouest. Il se situe au 3459 Notre-Dame Ouest, c'est juste à côté du marché Atwater.

Avant de commencer, si vous voulez juste savoir si vous devez y aller ou non : Vous devez y aller. Pour les autres, je continue avec ma critique.

Pour ceux qui ne le savent pas, j'aime bien l'indien. J'ai essayé le Cari Mela dans le coin qui était pour moi un choix sûr. Par contre, je dois dire que Rasoï est dans une classe à part du Cari Mela, c'est beaucoup plus de qualité.

En entrant, vous pouvez déjà y voir une atmosphère différente.

C'est fait pour être plus zen. Ma banquette avait des petits coussins sur celle-ci, on ne trouve pas ça partout.

Le menu est assez simple, mais offre beaucoup une dizaine de choix. Tous, sinon presque tous, les mets sont indiens. Il y a le grand classique du poulet au beurre et tandoori.

Nous avons commencé avec une entrée, du fromage pan'eer enrobé d'épices indiennes avec une petite salade. Sérieux, prenez ça à deux et ça sera malade dans votre bouche. C'est excellent.

Au niveau du plat principal, j'y suis été avec un classique poulet cari tikka qui vient avec un bol de riz et une salade. J'ai pris l'extra pain naan, car c'est très bon à manger pour ceux qui ne connaissent pas. Le plat était délicieux. En terme de quantité, j'ai du prendre un doggy bag à la fin!

Ma copine a décidé de prendre une pizza suite aux conseils de la serveuse. Ça fait bizarre prendre une pizza dans un restaurant indien. La pâte de pizza était... du pain naan! La pizza qu'elle a choisi était figues et pan'eer. C'était un goût vraiment spécial et très goûteux. Je vous avouerai qu'elle n'a pas été capable de manger toutes les figues puisque c'est sucré un peu.

Malheureusement, nous n'avions plus faim pour le dessert.

Je recommande beaucoup. La facture avec deux verres de vins (la sélection de bouteilles est quand même grande) a été de 77$. Je risque d'y retourner!

À découvrir!"}
{"text":"Whether you're indian or not, dont go in there. Specially if you're not, coz it will spoil your impression on Indian food. 

Tapas isn't just serving small portions with a fat bill. Its the quality and care given to each dish. 

Food took 45mins. Naan was cold, sent that back.

The owner gave a free creme brulee as a dessert. Hence three stars. But otherwise one."}
{"text":"Went a large group of friends for a birthday dinner. So we had the group menu, in the basement. The room was very dark, music very loud. Beautifully decorated but made it very hard to socialize. 

Onion bhajis were good, nothing over the top. The spring rolls were pretty good. The fig pizza was AMAZING on this crust naan. It is a must have, you will not be disappointed. I couldn't have a salad because there was no b vegetarian option unfortunately. I was quite disappointed with their lamb korma. The curry was too sweet, didn't taste like korma at all. I didn't end up eating it. My friends tasted it and all agreed that it was too sweet. The naans were fresh and very soft. They had a few mocktail options, I had one but can't remember the same and it was great! 

Overall a great fusion restaurant. Definitely plan on going there to try other items on the menu."}
{"text":"How should we start

Called a week or two ahead for 15 people. Called & emailed the day before to say we'd be closer to 10.

Poured out wine into the wrong people's glasses then tried to throw our glasses out. Even though we were only 9 people they forgot drinks. Tried to take away mid-done glasses of gin. Poured white wine into half filled glasses of people's rosé. The chef made a point of visiting the table once asked and was more than friendly but that didn't make up for the waitresses lack of attention. 

We weren't allowed to only have portions for the number of people who showed up. We were stuck with the portions for 15 people despite telling them a day in advance and despite telling them at the time we were less people. It's a Friday night. It's IMPOSSIBLE that the food UNCOOKED would have gone bad before their next service. ENTIRELY un-effing-acceptable. I couldn't believe a restaurant would act so recklessly when it comes to people buying 7+ $8 drinks on top of 6 bottles of wine and gave advanced notice of a possibly smaller group. Then they decided to \"be nice\" and only charge us for 13 people. When the confirmation call for the reservation was made, we were told we could move chairs, and that a change in numbers wouldn't be a problem. As if that was some huge favor. They also accepted a reservation for 830, knowing that their service takes so long and that they were \"doing us a favor\" by staying open late while we waited for our food. Our main dishes hadn't even come by 10:50. The last service, the actual main dishes, they gave us only 3 portions instead of the 4. So they're charging us for 13 \"as a favor\" but giving us portions for 12. So much for a favor... and these dishes aren't even enough to be mains for individuals, sincerely nothing impression in regards to portion size. 

The appetizers were good. The salads were awful. $12.80 bottle of SAQ wine for $38? That's way more than mark up.

Would I come back as a a group? F*** no. As a couple? I would certainly come in and enjoy a couple of dishes with someone who could offer good conversation. The way this was treated as a smaller than expected group was entirely unacceptable and clearly avoidable. We tried to compensate with other purchases (like over priced wines and drinks) yet we were met with nothing more than callous disregard for repeat business. I would like to say that I wish the business the best of luck, but sincerely, I don't. 

$110 (18% added to the bill for tip despite the service by the waitress being less than prime to say the least) later I am SERIOUSLY disappointed. Certainly no desire to return beyond the decor and maybe 2-3 plates to share. To quote another reviewer (Blake) \"The food: over priced, overwrought,  unimaginative, tepid and unfulfilling.\""}
{"text":"The food was good. The decor and ambiance is really nice. 
The menu was fusion but each plate did not seem very fusion. 
You can find items from different origins but each item seems to be fairly traditional.
The Naan pizza with figs was delicious and we highly recommend it.

The drinks were good; if you like bacon, order the Cajun Bloody Caesar."}
{"text":"We ordered from Rasoï online last night and had a very unpleasant experience.

Order came close to 30 minutes late, even though we literally live about 1 metro station distance away from the actual restaurant. It was a Friday after work so delivery seemed like a nice treat.

We were disappointed by tiny portions of both the $12 Butter Chicken (I counted six inch-sized cubes of Chicken which arrived in a small styrofoam cylinder mostly full of lukewarm non-spicy sauce) and also the $14 Vindaloo Goat Curry (which, to be fair, had tasty sauce, but was marred by a lack of goat and had two large bones which gave the illusion of the container being full.)

The $4 marinated carrots were okay but unremarkable.

The Garlic Naan was tasty but only one small piece for $3, so I ran out mid-meal and had to resort to using a fork.

BTW no rice is included with the prices above. Expect to just get nearly full, lilliputian Styrofoam containers with questionable meat to sauce ratio.

When you add in the $2.99 delivery fee, safe to say that I won't be ordering from there again. I wonder if the in house experience would be better? But if so, why treat some customers better than others?"}
{"text":"Un très bon souper avec happy hour à 5$/bière ou 30$/bouteille de vin.
Le poulet tandoori arrive fumant, la poutine de chèvre est un délice, l'agneau et son riz, un succès. Un régal pour les papilles dans un décor féérique aux couleurs vives et lumières tamisées.
Petit bémol côté service, trop de service tue le service, on se sent un peu observé et pas sitôt fini son assiette qu'on nous l'enlève. Attention aussi au 17% d'office attribué au service lors du paiement par CB.
Sinon rien à dire la nourriture est super bonne et originale. Belle découverte!"}
{"text":"I've had food from Rasoi a few times both for takeout and at the restaurant. I can't say I've explored the menu much because I stick to my favourites: the lamb poutine and the naan pizzas. Both are delicious and excellent choices. The service is good and friendly and the delivery is fast. The only problem is consistency - sometimes the pizzas, while still tasty, will not be as good as usual. But overall great restaurant!"}
{"text":"Bad and slow service
The food was sweet and overpriced
The cocktail tasted like water...
We had to ask for water and the server never came back to ask us how was the dishes.

After all the server didn't feel sorry when we told him about the service problem. The owner should think about what happened about their service training.

Not gonna come back again"}
{"text":"Staff were friendly and helpful. The food was simply amazing. Best Indian food I've ever tasted. Definitely a great restaurant memory. I'll be heading back there once I'm in Montreal again!"}
{"text":"Dining in Rasoi was an enjoyable and flavourful experience. We were party of nine and our long table was in process of being set up when we arrived, so the bar was the obvious place to attack with an immediate demand for Bloody Caesar. The smiling bartender fixed a pretty good drink for some of us, mine being non virgin and non vegetarian spicy version with beautiful piece of bacon. 

Once seated our orders were collected promptly. Bring a magnifier if you have one as the menu is written in the smallest possible script and it may be hard to read the detailed descriptions of the dishes. Appetizers and mains arrived orderly, and were served with a smile, even the chef checked on us. The arugula salad was nice mix of fresh ingredients and could be ordered without the few fried calamari pieces, which I realized too late. For mains I tried two of the traditional Indian vegetarian dishes: okra masala and chick peas. Both were absolutely delicious and quite spicy, definitely not spicy hot, but seasoning was used generously. The food was served in small bowls and its quantity is more of a tapas size, but I find it sufficient in terms of value for money. 

The interior design of Rasoi is to write for, there are a lot of nice cultural elements incorporated in the brick walls that indicate the ethnicity of the cuisine you would try, but the ceiling is what made me smile that night. Its colourful hippy flowers remind the 70s and made me sing in my mind \"love, peace, freedom, happiness\". My only complaint is the fact that my cloths smelled curry the next day, obviously the ventilation in the kitchen can be improved, but this is not a good reason to remove rating starts. Great dining option in the area!"}
{"text":"Le quartier St Henri se repeuple d'habitants longtemps abandonné par les guerres de gangs mais aussi d'excellents restaurants!
Razoï est une excellente surprise et un lieu accueillant. 

Tous d'abord le décor est somptueux, inspiré de l'orient et en particulier de l'Inde.

Je qualifie la cuisine d'indien fusion.
Je recommande leur cocktail en particulier le mojito aux mangues, un délice!

Le curryest délicieux.

Niveau prix : 20-30$ / personnes pour un repas complet"}
{"text":"Located right in St-Henri Rasoi is a restaurant that focuses on Indian fusion.  They have plenty of dishes that are considered traditional Indian food but they also have a few that combine Indian cuisine with that of another country.  Prices are reasonable for the area.

The decor is Indian-inspired but also very warm and inviting.  Upon entering the restaurant we were greeted by a very friendly host who seated us immediately.  Our waitress was also efficient and welcoming.  The only minor complaint I have is that after our main dishes were cleared we weren't asked if we wanted dessert, coffee or tea and we had to flag her down to get the bills.

To start I had Street Cart Spring Rolls which were traditional spring rolls with an Indian twist.  They had been seasoned with curry which was different but added a nice touch.  I topped it off with a naan pizza which was loaded with tandoori chicken, yogourt, cheese and onions.  The pizza was quite heavy but I really liked the chicken on it.  Most restaurants play it safe with the spice but these guys don't and I like that!

They have happy hour specials on beer and wine seven days a week.  We were able to split a bottle of wine for $30 which was pretty reasonable.  Also take note that the restaurant was fairly packed so it is best to play it safe and reserve (which you can easily do from the Yelp app FYI)."}
{"text":"Such a disappointing experience!! Went to Rasoi a few weeks ago with a group of 14 people. We had a $35 4 course fixed menu. I knew we were off to a bad start when one of the group members showed up late and missed the first course.. and the servers refused to serve her the food she missed. Oh sorry, or she could PAY EXTRA to get the first course. We are talking about an onion bahji here... One little fried appetizer! Would it have been a trouble for them to bring it to her? Absolutely not. Service is off to a great start. From there things just went from bad to worse. The time between courses was a good 20-30 minutes, and the portions were oh so small! For a table of 4, we were served 3 pieces of shrimp. Three. When we inquired about the missing shrimp, we were told it was not missing. You only get 3 shrimp for 4 people, and 4 shrimp for 6 people... What!!! We were served lots of bland vegetables to fill in space. Finally we got the naan pizzas.. they were very tasty, but once again very small and not enough food. When we complained this time, the manager agreed to bring us an extra pizza. Wow finally doing something to accommodate! The curry dishes were good but by this time (I had probably been at the restaurant for almost 3 hours now), everyone was just pissed and it was hard to enjoy the meal. All the servers were so rude. It is unfortunate because the food is actually delicious but I will NEVER go back due to the extremely poor service.. these people don't know how to treat customers. Of course then we were forced to tip well thanks to the service being included as we were a group... thanks for stealing more of my money!!"}
{"text":"My experience at Rasoï was a bit off, but I still left happy + full delish food. 

WARNING - I am not an Indian food expert by any means. Im a typical white North American in that I merely tried butter chicken at a wedding once and was hooked, and have tried a handful of Indian restaurants since that moment about 5 months ago. 

Annnnyyyways I headed to Rasoi with a group of 7 gals. We sat at the large table by the window, a great cozy spot in the corner. The place was just loud enough to create an enjoyable atmosphere, and like prior reviews have said, the decorations are unbelieveable - even the bathrooms! If you can find them

My group had many that were late, and we all trickled in over an hour between 6&7. I attribute this to the SLLLLLOW service. I think. I feel like I have to blame it on something. The drinks were flowing, but once we placed our order, it took over an hour to receive our food. The waiter checked in once to let us know the food would be coming, and then disappeared for 30 minutes until the food came. 

I ordered the Almond Butter Lamb. The lamb was great. Suuuper tender. But the flavors weren't anything special. Good, but that's about it. I also got the garlic naan, which I could've eaten 4lbs of if I wasn't around others who would definitely be repulsed by such an act. 

The winning act was the server apologized for the food delay & brought our table dessert. A mix of delicious brûlée's that were SO good 

Anyways - all in all I enjoyed my dinner here, and appreciated the restaurants kind act to make up for the delay of dinner"}
{"text":"Amazing food and drinks that make it worth the trip. Had a great interaction with the owner, Rex. Completely welcoming, laid back and most of all fun environment. The ambiance of the restaurant makes you want to stay all day! Absolutely coming back!"}
{"text":"rating for new terrace, too much noise coming from the kitchen while on terrace, need to work on lighting to give nicer vibe.

Food here is great though. 

For terrace, With a little work on little details would be great.

And you can up sell sooooo much if your service was faster."}
{"text":"We were a big group of 12 which means we've tried over 65% of the choices in the menu. Unfortunately, every single dish was SWEET! Is it an Indian sugar shack or what? Besides the decoration, there's nothing indian about this place and the \"fusion\" (by simply adding sugar), is not the proper way to re-invent the amazing food this country has to offer."}
