{"text":"Some of the best chicken pho I've ever had. Came with all the usual accoutrements (fresh basil, sprouts, etc.). Big portion for $9.75. Not the nicest in terms of ambiance if you're eating in (no music, just family shouting at each other in Vietnamese), but delicious food for take out or delivery."}
{"text":"We order from here all the time and are never disappointed. The rare beef pho soup is as good as any I have had downtown/near Chinatown; the broth is flavourful and delicious and the ingredients are always fresh. The guy who regularly delivers our food is friendly and courteous. I highly recommend."}
{"text":"I love the place.  We had the bass with mango salad, and the chicken and the beef vermicelli.  The dishes were attractively presented, delicious and reasonably priced.  Best of all, however, are the people who run it.  They were welcoming and pleasant and--big bonus--funny.  Our server had us chuckling all the way home."}
{"text":"I'm a little confused about the other reviews here, because my and my husband's experience here tonight was terrible.

First for the positives. The place was very modern and nice looking, if a little too bright. Very clean. The waitress was nice; not great at her job, but smiling and friendly. And that's it for the positives.

Walking in, we were greeted by the sound of a child making ear-piercing noises. He appeared to be the son of one of the family that owned the place, and his mother walked around holding a baby that intermittently cried throughout our meal.

For the actual meal, the complimentary \"salad\" was a plate of raw bean sprouts and (I think) cilantro. It was very prettily presented, but after a couple of bites neither of us could see a reason to continue eating it.

We then ordered the chicken pad thai, and beef ball rice noodle soup, which we intended to share. The pad thai was by far the more edible of the two, but tasted exactly like a frozen tv dinner. It was rather bland and unremarkable, it's main flavor just being a light sweetness. My husband rather enjoyed it once he'd added a ton of chili sauce from the table, but it certainly wasn't worth its 11ish dollar price tag.

The beef ball soup was atrocious, however. Every single meatball, sliced in half, was a uniform grey colour with approximately 10 gristles protruding out from it. The texture was inedible. We each tried to eat one and immediately had to spit it out. The broth itself seemed primarily flavoured by cilantro. Otherwise, there was no hint of a \"broth\" taste to it. After a few bites, we put it to the side, along with the salad, where it was never bussed. Under normal circumstances, someone couldn't pay us nine dollars to eat this, let alone charging that much.

Dessert (which we'd ordered alongside our main course) was a jackfruit milkshake. This was fine, but had very little flavour. It needed more sugar, perhaps, because it tasted mostly of milk and not much of fruit. Again, not worth the five dollar price tag.

We know this is a family-run restaurant, and we feel very sorry to have to give it such a bad review. We really wanted the place to be good. But given the inexplicably good reviews listed here, we couldn't not mention how bad our experience was. Save your money."}
{"text":"Great place! I got the pork vermicelli bowl and my boyfriend got the rare beef pho. My bowl was amazing, the pork was so tender and full of flavour. My boyfriends soup was great as well the broth was on point. Great environment very clean , okay service bot bad. Would have given a full 5 stars however I prefer the spring rolls at other Vietnamese restaurants they have a different wrapper here I think and much smaller . Overall yummy though!"}
{"text":"Great food! Tried the pork vermicelli which is mouth watering grilled pork with a spring roll, also chicken pho, and grilled chicken on rice. Drool. Haven't yet tried the beef pho."}
{"text":"It is a beautiful place nice and clean food was good love the green curry fish and pho was awesome good for winter."}
{"text":"I was looking forward to the recent opening of this place and I am happy to report that it is definitely a place to be excited about!
I had their tofu fresh spring rolls and tofu lemon grass pho, it was absolutely delicious and so much food. Definitely worth the visit and authentic as it gets!"}
{"text":"Great pho. Family owned. One of the better more authentic vietnamese foods in city. Reasonable priced too"}
{"text":"The service is terrible and the special chicken #20 theirs nothing special about it... people need to stop exaggerating about this place."}
{"text":"This is a local pho that just opened. They mostly offer non pho dishes, the pho selection is quite small actually compared to the pho places moe downtown. The beef balls pho was good but the broth was very light and didn't have the flavor of the more established pho places around king and ossington. The ingredients were fresh though and overall not bad just not as good.  Lots of pho competition in Toronto."}
{"text":"Having moved to the aea over a year ago, we having walking past this place often thinking, \"how good can it be, being located in Greektown\"? We finally decided to give it a try and boy, did we kick ourselves for not doing sooner. Hands down some of the best Vietnamese and Thai food I have ever eaten. Do yourself a favour and order the green curry chicken. It's to die for."}
{"text":"I don't why this place is called Pho Challenge when they have such a small pho menu, they have very few pho meat selections (no tendon, no brisket, no tripe, no 'house' special like all other places), and there is only 1 size. 

As for the pho itself, the broth was bland and watery. The noodles were ok and the rare beef was standard. 

The restaurant is newly renovated. Not very clean, not very dirty. We were not offered tea or water."}
{"text":"Newly renovated, super clean and most importantly run by a nice family. Decent pho and OK prices."}
{"text":"Nice little family run pho joint that hangs more on the side of thai cooking. Green curry is excellent, tons of different veggies. I don't think I've ever been disappointed by anything on this menu that I've ordered. Crispy noodle also very enjoyable. I could go on, but you should just go here."}
