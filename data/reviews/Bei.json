{"text":"Amazing! They have lunch specials everyday, not just M-F. The Sunshine Roll is pure heaven, in fact, I can't stop thinking about it. The sushi is super fresh and beautifully presented. Cute place, great sushi, awesome service, I'm totally hooked!"}
{"text":"Went here and was somewhat disappointed.  Food was mediocre and service was very slow.  Was basically run of the mill americanized asian food (not that there's anything wrong with americanized asian food but there's nothing good about run of the mill)."}
{"text":"My honey and I came here for the 1st time it was good would defiantly come again, we want to try happy hour or reverse happy hour! :) I had the spicy crispy chicken and he had the Bei Bulgogi both super tasty would defiantly order again but would ask for the Bei Bulgogi spicy next time, service was great too! We'll recommend and come again....."}
{"text":"I came after seeing reviews for reverse happy and boy was I not dissapointed. Our server Cody was super attentive (and cute too). You really can't beat good sushi, cheap drinks, and a good time! Highly recommend coming here instead of some of those other more expensive places around here! I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"They have really good happy hour specials and the staff is always very friendly. One of the better sushi places in town."}
{"text":"Their lunch specials include a lot of food, and the prices are great. Same goes for happy hour. The staff has been incredibly nice every time I've been there. The manager even stopped at our table a couple times to make sure everything was okay."}
{"text":"Awesome reverse happy hour. 

Big fan of kabuki but this place definitely is just as good. 

The volcano roll is delicious and so well prepared.

Chill, low key atmosphere. Glad we discovered it."}
{"text":"If you're looking for an inexpensive but delicious date night, this is it!! We went during happy hour and it is awesome!! Egg rolls, 2 salads, 2 meals for $27. Unheard of! Will definitely be back"}
{"text":"I am a happy hour junkie and this is probably my favorite place to go. There are so many delicious things to chose from on their happy hour menu! Their Bei stuffed mushrooms and the Las Vegas roll are my favorite. I also loved the Escolar Nigiri when it was on happy hour. I wish they would bring back the Chili Garlic Edamame on happy hour but it was probably too popular. 

Their house sake is only $2.50 and certain well drinks are only $3.50. I go there so much Chase knows what I want to drink right when I walk in lol. 

I recently went their during lunch and their lunch specials are also awesome. You can get two basic rolls (includes alaska and tootsie) and a miso soup for $8.95! I wish this place was closer to work so that I could eat it everyday."}
{"text":"The food was awesome but the service sucks. We went there today to get a sashimi and 2 hand rolls. It wasn't a busy Monday and it took 30 mins to serve the sashimi. Really?! We thought they probably went fishing in the fish tank and can't get the fish out. Then we waited 15 mins for the salmon skin hand roll. Then we noticed that only few people left eating, so we decided to order another 2 spicy tuna hand roll and the 2 nigiri, we thought maybe this time it will come out faster but it took another 25 mins for the spicy tuna hand roll and another 15 mins for the nigiri. Seriously!? Our order was not that complicated and you don't have boil it or cook it for that long. Over all the service was so bad but the food taste good."}
{"text":"I lost my wallet over a month ago, and long gave up on ever finding it. I just happen to come back here and 5 weeks later, the waitress I had last time (Kelsey) walks over to me and says \"you left this here a while back\"
Nothing was spent, cash or credit. These are amazing people.
And by the way, the food here is awesome too. So come in and ask for Kelsey. You won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Excellent veg options. Full menu, great sushi, not too shabby on price especially during happy hour."}
{"text":"I dropped by for lunch. I had one of their lunch specials ... a vegetable tempura bento box. It was excellent. I wanted to order a roll, but I was told that the bento box would suffice. There was quite a bit of food! I plan on going again. I want to try something else! :)"}
{"text":"Extremely friendly and fun atmosphere.   We had lunch with appetizer .   Very good , fresh and delicious.   Our waiter was very attentive and helpful.   His name was Hung. We will be back again."}
{"text":"I love eating here! The dynamite scallop roll is one of my favorites and always comes out fantastically. The staff are very friendly and I enjoy my evening dinners here. The food is delicious and very affordable."}
{"text":"Walked into this place for the 5th or 6th time in the past 1.5 months just to be confronted by a waitress accusing my coworker and I of dipping out on part of the check 3 weeks ago. Yes 3 weeks ago. I asked for the details and she said the bill was $23 and we put a $20 down and left. She said she tried to chase after us but we drove off...... This of course is not true as neither my coworker or I would do this..... We asked for the receipt in the computer system because we were very confused and she was appalled we would ask for that. We apologized for the misunderstanding and even offered to square the bill away by putting $5.00 on the table. She stormed off banging dishes around and gave us nasty looks. A few minutes later we called her over and pointed at the $5.00 on the table just to hear her say, \"It's up to my manager\" and stormed off into the office with the $5.00 bill.....I don't appreciate being accused of dipping on a portion ($3.00) of the bill and won't be returning."}
{"text":"Best sushi in The Phoenix area! Staff is always pretty nice and the quality is awesome. Have never had a roll I didn't like! I go there a few times a month! Highly recommend you try it out"}
{"text":"Great value for your buck!  I've enjoyed most of the sushi bars in Scottsdale. The Value of the sushi in Bei more than makes up for the slight lack in ambience.  The hapy hour opening prices are some of the best deals in Scottsdale.  $2.95 California roles to the $6.95 scallop role. I included some pics. Look no further if you are looking for good sushi for a great price in Scottsdale..."}
{"text":"Had the sushi lunch.   And a saki bomber.  Nice friendly quick service on a Saturday  under $30.  Nothing special but more than average for Phoenix at a reasonable price"}
{"text":"Service was ok, not very good but not terrible. The sushi was pretty good but I've had better. The decor and feeling of the restaurant is kind of shab and not too warm or welcoming. Pretty much an average experience with average food and normal sushi prices. Worth going if you're in the area and are craving sushi but there are definitely much better places with comprable pricing, i.e. sushi 101, sake bomber, kabuki, etc..."}
{"text":"Amazing. Started with the miso soup and house salad. Also chose the chili garlic edamame as an appetizer. For our sushi roll, we selected the Desert Sunset Roll- (Shrimp Tempura, Crab Mix, and Cucumber, topped with Yellowtail, Avocado, and Ponzu Aioli). Incredible. The highlight of the meal had to be the  Spicy Crispy Chicken. Phenomenal. If you're looking for a laid-back, casual spot with fantastic food, Bei will not disappoint!"}
{"text":"Love this place. They have great happy hour deals for when you have a hankering for raw fish. My only criticism is that their staff is sometimes lacking which causes longer than usual wait times. Definitely a great time."}
{"text":"Great place, great food, great people that work there, great clientele that goes in there. I've eaten there a couple times and will continue to be a regular"}
{"text":"#1 choice for fish in the middle of the desert. By far my favorite sushi spot with great happy hour prices. 

Even when we travel, we always make sure to stop here on our in between days at home.

The Nebraska roll and Golden Philly are top notch. 

Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"If you're looking for great sushi and not looking to break the bank, Bei is the best affordable sushi in Scottsdale.   Great happy hour and always great service with a smile.  My personal favorite roll has to be the Golden Alaska.  Definitely recommended, and it's an even better time with good friends."}
{"text":"What an awesome place for really great fresh sushi! Very reasonable $$ with great rolls on their happy hour menu...For great service, ask for Chase !"}
{"text":"I went to this restaurant on 7/5/2014 and when I went in the atmosphere was nice. However it took a long time for the waiter to come take my order. That's not the worst when I finally got my food and started eating their was a COCK ROACH crawling out of it. It was so disgusting I called the manager over and he saw it crawling around in the food and was grossed out. He said this has never happend  and said its because it came from the back kitchen, but he can assure me that he can make me fresh sushi. I said no, I don't won't anything from here ever again. I didn't have to pay the bill, but I just thought you all should know that this restaurant is not sanitary. I will be reporting them to the health department. I've never experienced anything like this."}
{"text":"Excellent happy hour menu! Free Miso Soup with check in. The salmon nigiri sushi off the happy hour menu was soooo melt in your mouth! Reasonable prices and quick service."}
{"text":"The people were helpful and the service was quick. I would absolutely go here again! The happy hour is great! There were a variety of different rolls to choose from"}
{"text":"The best happy hour. Amazing appetizers especially the Gyoza and Bei eggs rolls. The house wine, large beers, sake bombs, soju Toni, large beers, and well drinks are all on happy hour. Happy hour runs from 4-7 everyday and the servers are always very attentive and helpful!"}
{"text":"I ordered the tempura udon and teriyaki beef rice bowl to go. The food was tightly packed in a to-go bag to avoid spillage and the udon was still piping hot when I got home. The udon serving was HUGE! The noodles had a perfectly firm texture even after sitting in the broth for a while. I think I got 4 pieces of tempura veggies + 1 shrimp, all very tasty. The teriyaki beef rice bowl was a tad salty, but the rice was perfect. Tons of food, great price, totally eating here again."}
{"text":"Great food AND service.  Have only been for lunch and order the lunch box special.  You get A LOT for the price.  I am picky when it comes to seafood and this is FRESH will continue to return over and over again.  Highly recommend."}
{"text":"I am a regular, sometimes twice a week. The lunch specials make my budget happy.  Everything I have tired has been delicious."}
{"text":"OMG. I came here for my birthday and it was amazing.  All the service and food is exceptional. Chang was wonderful."}
{"text":"It's a good sushi place and the go to place in the neighborhood for sushi. They do have weird hours where they close for the afternoon for 2 hours and actually was turned away once when they were close to closing. So that is annoying when looking for a late lunch."}
{"text":"Fantastic place.  It has great sushi for a very reasonable price.  They have great happy hour prices. I have recommended this to anyone they enjoys sushi."}
{"text":"Food & service was too notch!! Some of the best sushi I have had in a very long time. If you come, try to get the waiter Hung. He is super nice & has great recommendations. I was a first time customer from out of town. Will for sure be stopping in here each time I'm in Scottsdale!"}
{"text":"Best rolls in Scottsdale and better than Ra.What more can you ask for in a land locked state? Plus it's right by Dairy Queen."}
{"text":"I'm so glad that we found this place.  I've only had rolls and I highly recommend them. Prices are fair and the lunch special can't be beat, but it's great for dinner as well.  Special shout out to Gary, a great waiter!"}
{"text":"Can I eat here every day please?! I am a down to the bone sushi lover! Every time I have been here the service is nothing short of perfect. Always comes out right (even when modifications are made), quick, and with a smile. The manager always comes to the table to check in and you can tell he truly wants you to have a great experience. 

The house rolls are phenomenal!! I took a friend who isn't a sushi fan, he ate 3 different rolls and has gone back on his own! I'm pretty sure the Red Dragon roll is my new favorite food ever!!"}
{"text":"Nice people good food. The service was sub par. I ordered a volcano, dynamite, and spicy tuna roll with my boy friend along with sake bombs. Great date spot if you aren't in a rush."}
{"text":"Hung our server is great.  He remembered from last time that were here that I wanted to try the Spicy Chirashi Bowl. I ordered the Spicy Chirashi bowl and it is perfect."}
{"text":"Doesn't get better than their lunch special.  Also the Scottsdale roll is worth a try."}
{"text":"Best sushi in town! Service and food are both top notch. Definitely our go-to sushi joint."}
{"text":"Sushi is always amazing!!! Definitely recommend this place. Clean and service is good. Great HH too!!!"}
{"text":"This place is delicious!!! Highly recommend their happy hour. We started with Miso soup and Gyouza, this place has the best Gyouza (my apologies for probably spelling that wrong). They've got great vegetarian and non raw rolls for those who are afraid of he delicious raw stuff. AND, they've only got one bullet hole in the window."}
{"text":"Recently stopped in Phoenix's newest Sushi restaurant. We arrived at BEI for early dinner at around 430 with a large group and sampled just about everything on the menu. By 530 the place was filled. Yet the food and service was excellent even when they were so busy. We have been to 4 other Sushi restaurants in the greater Phoenix Area and this one is head and shoulders above the rest. We WILL be back on our next trip to Phoenix."}
{"text":"Fantastic food.  A little pricy for a small strip-mall location.  Regardless, I will be back."}
{"text":"Our family use to live near Bei and ate here all the time, but moved to Chandler. We drive to eat sushi at Bei because it is so delicious!!!! Very clean and great service everytime. The server today was friendly and professional."}
{"text":"Great find. We were visiting from out of town and trying to find some good sushi. Happy we found Bei! Our food was really good- my husband especially enjoyed the Nevada roll. We also had really great service. Would definitely return."}
{"text":"I went to BEI the first week it opened.  It was great.  The sushi was excellent and fresh.  The tempura and Korean pork was awesome.  And, I had my first \"sojutini\" .  The wait staff was attentive and the ambience was casual and warm.  I will be back.  Cannot wait to try the lunch specials."}
{"text":"I love this place, and the sushi is awesome!! Bartenders are so nice and kind to customers, and I got free drinks"}
{"text":"Went with friends around 11 at night or so on a Friday. Ordered the salmon roll, shrimp tempura, and shared mochi ice cream with some friends. All tasted fine.

Woke up the next morning with cramps, fever, chills, nausea, diarrhea, and vomiting.

Draw your own conclusions."}
{"text":"Loose rolls that fall apart a lot and too much imitation crab. The seafood dynamite tasted very low quality."}
{"text":"Being a lover of sushi my husband and I love to check all as many local sushi places as possible. This place has great reviews but the sushi did not live up to our expectations. The classic rolls (i.e., spicy tuna) was the best thing we had. All of their 'specialty' rolls seemed similar and we're not great. Main upside of this place...they're open until midnight!"}
{"text":"Excited to come back for a second time! Enjoyed my sashimi (which I'm always hesitant to order the first time at a sushi restaurant). Good service!!"}
{"text":"Bei is a great lunch spot.  Their Bento boxes are awesome.   Rice bowls are fantastic as well.  The service is occasionally iffy. The servers aren't too attentive, they get your order right so I suppose that's all you can ask for Scottsdale service.   But the food is very good.  I can't speak too it for an evening spot but the lunch is fantastic. 
Try the Nebraska roll, one my personal favorites."}
{"text":"The worst sushi and sashimi and overall service I been to in AZ. Food is terrible. Trust me I am Asian and I know what good Asian cuisine is. Owner is very nice but that's it. Don't stop and keep driving. It's a waste of ur hard earned money."}
{"text":"I would definitely come back. Service was great. The greeter was very traditional & attentive. The selection is good for any type of sushi eater. Spicy garlic edamame is good also."}
{"text":"This place has great sushi for a great price. Coming from the northwest I'm use to a lot of great fish and sushi, but this place really surprised me by having some great fresh fish and great atmosphere. The happy hour is excellent and has some great drinks for a great price. Highly recommend the volcano roll best bang for your buck."}
{"text":"Fast and friendly.  Their Happy Hour is quite good.  Try the Bei Special Roll, it's ridiculous."}
{"text":"Great service! First time here....from Los Angeles...family time! The atmosphere is awesome and it smells great! Our server Ella is very friendly and welcoming."}
{"text":"I don't leave many reviews as you can tell (duh). I am however always trying new sushi places and with most restaurants you like some rolls and other rolls are just so-so. But with Bei EVERYTHING I've tried I absolutely LOVE!! I honestly can not say that about other local sushi establishments. (No am not a paid actor lol) I really love this place, it's my new favorite sushi place you should def try it! :-) Even the staff is friendly especially Elle. She kept saying thank you every time I liked something lol"}
{"text":"I'm very selective about sushi since I'm from Hawaii, and this place exceeds my expectations.  The fish is as fresh as you can get in AZ, the service is fast and friendly, and the prices are reasonable. The best part for me?  It's the closest sushi place to my home. :)  They have a great happy hour menu, as well as live music on select nights.  Check in to Yelp for a free miso soup!"}
{"text":"This is a really good sushi restaurant in Scottsdale. Too many sushi joints in the area are overpriced. Bei is priced well and has great sushi options.  The service was friendly and timed well.  I will definitely return to try different rolls."}
{"text":"Awesome happy hour menu and prices. Good service and stays open late! I was actually surprised by how well everything turned out.... it is a well kept secret, but definitely worth stopping by!"}
{"text":"Good food and service with a smile! Loved that they gave us lots of sauces with our sushi. 
Menu is huge, a bit overwhelming. Pretty good for AZ sushi. I would come back!"}
{"text":"Their crispy spicy chicken is the bomb! I drive 30 minutes to eat it. Great atmosphere, friendly staff and a full bar, so you can't go wrong. Sushi is also very good.n"}
{"text":"Excellent Addition to SoDo!

My boyfriend and I ate at Bei for the first time last night, and we were pleasantly surprised. We have been long time patrons on Sushi 101, but I believe Bei is equally as satisfying, if not better. The happy hour sushi menu is incredible. Their specialty rolls are the most reasonably priced sushi you will find at any happy hour. We ordered the Las Vegas roll, for just under $7, and it was phenomenal in appearance, size, and flavor! All of the rolls we ordered, including the basic spicy tuna roll, were very generously portioned, and I am not just talking about extra rice to make them appear larger. The fish was supplied in large quantities/cuts, and was fresh and flavorful. 

When we first entered the establishment, we were immediately greeted and ushered in by the owners/managers with warm smiles and great attitudes. Our waitress Brittany was equally enthusiastic and good-natured, providing suggestions and attention to our needs. I also ordered the house sake, which came in a smaller sized bottle, but still amounted to three shots, and for $2.50, I have no complaints! The sake was the perfect temperature and went down smoothly. They also offer sake bombs for $6.95 during all business hours, instead of limiting the special to happy hour. There was live music when happy hour ended at 7, but the ambiance was relaxing and the tunes weren't overbearing. 

I will definitely return to this establishment in the future, and recommend it to anyone looking for some great sushi in SoDo (SoSco? Or whatever they end up labeling Scottsdale south of Indian School...)! 

P.S. Our waitress pronounced it as 'Bay'"}
{"text":"I was in town for a conference and wanted a quick sushi dinner on my first night in. This place did not disappoint! I ordered and it was delivered to me in under 30 minutes! I chose the cucumber salad, which was delicious and well-balanced (not too acidic) and the Big Time Roll, which was delicious. I was also thrilled that they did not put the extra sauce on the roll, as I usually like less sauce than others. Overall, this was absolutely the right choice and I would order from them again!"}
{"text":"It is safe to say this is our favorite sushi happy hour or any hour. They prepare their sushi fast + fresh !"}
{"text":"For a sushi restaurant so far from the coast, the sushi here was super-fresh, served fast and the staff was friendly. We sampled from the late night happy hour menu--good value. It was delicious, and we will be back!"}
{"text":"The food was super yummy! My favorite was the checkerboard roll. I have one sushi place I normally stick with, but it's definitely worth coming back to bei!"}
{"text":"My eating here was fantastic! The quality. price points and service was exceptional!! Most importantly, the restaurant, kitchen and restrooms were spotless. I would recommend to anyone as the sushi eating spot. Cheers to good sushi!!!"}
{"text":"Extremely happy we found this place.  Sushi is good and reasonablly priced.  Nice atmosphere, not trendy.  Good Happy Hour.
Cody was our server and did a great job."}
{"text":"Service is always great and the food is so good! Affordable too. The miso soup is great and the atmosphere is mellow and comfortable. Staff is always smiling and food is priced fairly. Definitely great sushi spot. And the bowls are good too."}
{"text":"Best sushi place around the south Scottsdale area. Make your way out of the trendy \"sushi\" restaurants in old town and head a bit south to find this gem. Don't be scared of the outside, make your way in to find friendly staff and one of the best sushi jointsin town. We had a large group come in late on a Saturday and the place was empty. Will be nice to see this place fill up once more people hear about it."}
{"text":"We walked into this place about fifteen minutes before they closed the sushi bar, and we are so glad we did! The sushi was absolutely amazing. The customer service was outstanding. They are super friendly and attentive. The only reason they got four stars is because their tuna was ok...I recommend the salmon sushi rolls! Especially the spicy one with jalapeños. we will definitely be going back."}
{"text":"We love coming to Bei for sushi night. Their appetizers are also killer add well as general atmosphere. My favorite drink is the bloody Mary"}
{"text":"Always delicious! The servers are always friendly and the place is very clean. We love the asparagus role and awesome lunch specials!"}
{"text":"The service is fast and accommodating! I would recommend the Aloe Soju Tini because it's refreshing and sweet! Would definitely come back again"}
{"text":"Great place for sushi! After living in Chicago for many years, it's been tough finding a good sushi place around here for take out. Glad to have this place near by. It's our go to for japanese take out."}
{"text":"Very fresh/high quality fish and Chef was willing to also make custom creations.  Prices are great and staff is friendly. Definitely will be back when visiting Scottsdale."}
{"text":"A fave spot to go to in south Scottsdale. Their happy hour is reasonably priced so it's a great place for early dinner. Great beer specials too!"}
{"text":"Since we used Yelp to find this restaurant, thought it only fair to provide a review.
We arrived in Phoenix today and looked on Yelp for nearby sushi (our go to meal when traveling).
We are staying near the university in Tempe so hoped to get away a bit.
We saw the reviews and location in Scottsdale for Bei so headed there for dinner.
We had a 7 PM reservation (made this afternoon) and were taken directly to our table and greeted almost immediately by our waiter. 
While the restaurant seemed full and there were some people waiting, they seemed well staffed.
Our waiter brought our water and drinks fairly quickly and then took our dinner order. 
We ordered edamame as well as a sashimi sampler and a couple of rolls and were off to a good start.
We got rice and some kind of sauce fairly quickly that we were told was for the sashimi and then didn't see our first order of food (the sashimi) until we were there for at least another 20 minutes. 
We were surprised the edamame wasn't served sooner but assume our waiter forgot. It did eventually arrive and was hot and flavorful.
The sashimi platter was served by a different waitress who dropped it off at the table without saying a word, almost walking away as she brought it before we could even ask her to maybe explain the dish a bit. 
She also happened to bring out the two rolls we ordered and same story. 
We weren't sure if she was just having a bad night or was always like that so we mentioned her affect to our waiter who then sent the manager. 
When it comes to sushi and the work the chefs do to prepare, it would seem the presentation of the dish is at least a part of the experience and she clearly hadn't gotten the message. 
He was extremely apologetic and said he would speak to the waitress.
He came by several times again to apologize and actually took 10% off the total for the late food and sporadic service.
We did notice the waitress was more interactive with other tables later so assume she took her managers advice. 
The food was better than average when it arrived so that combined with the managers efforts to recover from poor service rate Bei 4 stars.
FYI, did comment the restaurant was loud, mainly due to a woman at the table next to us who had an abnormally loud laugh."}
{"text":"I'm a huge sushi fan and this place is amazing.  From the service to the absolutely amazing sushi rolls.   Yum, yum, yum"}
{"text":"One of my favorite places to eat sushi in Scottsdale.  Great staff, great food and overall a 5* experience. Always crave Bei for their awesome fish."}
{"text":"They're inching on \"meh\" territory now...

Took a friend and shared my praise for Bei.  We had overly bland service (I'm sorry, were we keeping you from something honey) which turned into bizarre service.

As we were down to merely nibbling on food, my dining mate ordered another cocktail.  Apparently we were expected to chug the drinks, pay, and then get the f outta there in 3 minutes.  Because as we continued to talk, every little item on our table was meticulously rearranged, talked about, and eventually removed.  Hours before they were to close, and with plenty of other folks in the restaurant (it was maybe 8:45), we both had to move around the waiters coming to take the condiments off the table, as if they were cleaning up and we had clearly overstayed our welcome.

If we hadn't just ordered drinks (cost money and can't be taken as to-go drinks of course), or it was late and near closing time, or if the place was packed, we'd have absolutely left.  But then, we also wouldn't have ordered more drinks. Altogether, I was embarrassed to have recommended this place for so long, when it left a majorly bitter taste in our mouths.

Ra may be corporate but at least they aren't dicks."}
{"text":"It was 7PM on a Sunday and the place was pretty empty. Our waitress made it very clear by her rudeness and hey body language that she did not want to be there so we didn't bother her too much. The other servers were awesome and the food was OK.

The waitress (black haired girl named Carlee) never checked in on us and after we flagged her down to pay the bill she finally dragged herself over. We asked if we could get the bill split, and if not that's OK we could figure it out... She rolled her eyes and said \"I'm not sure, I'll see what I can do\". Then she came back with the split bill.

This is no exaggeration, this is verbatim what she said: \"Just to let you people know; it's standard protocol to ask the server to split your bill BEFORE you order!\"

We were speechless. One of our guys went to get the owner's number and while he was at the bar, Carlee came back and said unsolicitedly: \"I don't have time for this and it's at the server's discretion.\" Once again, the place was empty.

After a few other rude remarks from her, we left her 0 tip and felt badthat she ruined it for the other servers who were great.

SO- if you go here, go to the BAR! AVOID CARLEE!"}
{"text":"Just your average sushi. Would recommend Mido Sushi for better pricing and they have an all-you-can-eat price for those who love sushi and have a big appetite."}
{"text":"We love sushi and are happy to have found such a cool spot close to home. Katrina was an awesome server and the food was great!"}
{"text":"Salads remain tasty, and the calamari fillet appetizer was tasty. Hot sake is also good. This is the second time I've been here, and the second time I have received so-so service from the sour-faced waitress and great service from the busboy. I wish my tip would go to him exclusively. 

Come for the starting salad... Then get out quickly and go elsewhere for main courses and sushi rolls, as ours were of average quality and upper-third pricing."}
{"text":"Overall not a bad place. I've been here once and our service was extremely slow. I know it's because we were a couple and not the loud and rowdy pack of college aged guys that the waitress was helping (gotta get them tips) but we went a while without drinks and longer without refills. The food was on par of similar places, nothing special. The only bad thing I can remember about the establishment happened outside, when some form of Bei management come into the local DQ I was eating at and yelling at the staff there because of their patrons using Bei's restroom. It came off as really unprofessional and it actually made us lose our appetite while eating at DQ."}
{"text":"Happy hour Tuesday all day is the best.  Drinks,  apps,  sushi.  Separate bar side from sushi bar & restaurant makes is perfect to separate nights out."}
{"text":"We came to Bei because we always drive by it and wanted to check it out. It was a late lunch and there was no rush. We were immediately seated and got our drinks. Had the chicken teriyaki bento box and bolgogi bowl. Both were enough food for us and we had no left overs. The service wasn't mind blowing but they checked in a handful of times- they seemed like they needed a bit of an energy burst. Nonetheless, the price point was awesome! We will definitely be coming back."}
{"text":"What a fun night out! Bei has a great sushi selection, and it was hard for me to choose! Eventually, I narrowed it down to the calamari roll, which was delicious. My mom, who had told me she wasn't a fan of sushi, even ate a few pieces of my roll. I also loved the coconut shrimp, which was served with a delicious spicy sauce. Service was lovely, and the tea was superb. I highly recommend stopping by Bei if you want some good Japanese food!"}
{"text":"New to Scottsdale and have been looking for a go-to sushi place in south Scottsdale. Bei is now on top of the list. The food is delicious, the ambiance relaxed, and the service exceptional. If you're in the area, or just enjoy good asian cuisine, definitely give it a try. 

And a couple of recommendations: although I prefer a beer with my dinner, they also serve stellar soju cocktails (try the Aloe \"soju-tini\" - light and refreshing). The ASU roll also stood out - quality ingredients and skilled preparation. The people that run this place really seem to care."}
{"text":"Great sushi options, attentive service.  The edamame and miso soup are to die for."}
{"text":"Baked Alaska Roll, Golden Philly Roll, Spicy Tuna Roll & Green Tea Tempura Ice Cream | If you're looking for a sushi spot with an excellent happy hour then Bei Sushi is the perfect spot for you!  We love their monthly revolving happy hour sushi menu, and the fact that it lasts until 7:30.  Don't forget to save room for the green tea ice cream you definitely don't want to miss it!"}
{"text":"Bei is a hidden gem in a strip mall that doesn't seem special.

I've during a happy hours for a few time, and they don't disappoint. Their specialty rolls are great, especially the volcano roll w/ fried scallop. their nigiris are good, but not exceptional.

Bei is a good sushi joint with good value. Take your bae to Bei, it won't disappoint!"}
{"text":"Friday after work happy hour spot. 4rolls, 2 sakis, and of course Olivia. Great service by Hung every time! Really fast and the sushi is fresh. Definitely recommend! This is my first yelp review btw.. Won't be my last :)"}
{"text":"My wife and I stopped at Bei for a late lunch and were blown away by both the quality and prices. The sushi was exceptional and the happy hour prices were unbelievable. I have happily paid more money for lower quality sushi in the past. We will definitely be  coming back here as often as possible."}
{"text":"I love bei. I go to bei at least twice a week. Tonight, however, I was very disappointed. I called at 10:35 and asked for two spicy tuna bowls to go. I always order these usually around 10:45. However, I was told by Chris that the kitchen had close only a couple minutes before and there was nothing he could do. I told him I've never had a problem. He said there was nothing he could do again very unsympathetic. As a loyal customer, who has never had this issue  with such matter you can see why I am disappointed. I had to come to RA instead. I don't know but I don't think it takes very much to make a spicy tuna bowl seeing how the sushi rice is usually in stand by as well as the spicy tuna. So sad dunno when I will return."}
{"text":"Awesome service and the food was great! I got the chicken teriyaki bowl and the volcano sushi roll. The roll was really heavy on the meat which was awesome and the bowl was a great amount of food for the cost! Will definitely be coming back"}
{"text":"Bei has had the absolute worst customer service I have ever witnessed. I am very upset, and appalled with this restaurant."}
{"text":"Sushi was amazing. I ordered the Las Vegas and baked salmon roll and it was super delicious! I hope to go again before I leave. Also, the staff was very friendly & great!"}
{"text":"Good sushi for a good price. Staff was pleasant and quick. I have recommended to several friends and they have echoed my thoughts."}
{"text":"The sushi was delicious! We had great service and the happy hour was so worth it. We ordered salmon rolls, philly rolls, and an octopus roll. They were all made really well."}
{"text":"Ordered a Red Dragon (minus the Crab mix add additional Spicy Tuna) (Great - this one was my Favorite) and the Tuna Lovers (Good) - the fish was fresh and both rolls were very tasty! I'll be back!"}
{"text":"Service was very prompt and we received our food at an impressive speed. The Happy Hour special had a variety of special rolls to choose from-would recommend the Hawaiian roll. 

Would not recommend the spicy tuna roll. The sashimi was EXCELLENT- very fresh and generous portions. We will return to explore more of their sashimi selection and excellent service."}
{"text":"This place is tooooo good. Best happy hour! Haven't tried a roll I don't like and they have such a variety. Great go to place for quick sushi with great prices"}
{"text":"Most of my experiences here have been very pleasant. My favorites are the golden philly roll and the chili garlic edamame. Great happy hour!"}
{"text":"First time here and I was very pleasantly surprised.  The place could use a facelift, walking in, you wouldn't expect that you'd find quality food.   Service was ok, so if I could do 3.5 stars I would, but leaning more towards 4 than 3.

sashimi and uni and rolls were very good and the prices are very reasonable - great value for the money.  Will be back."}
{"text":"When I walked in there was only one lady working ...i order food to go and she didn't know how to work the cash register , so I had to wait 45 minutes for the other lady ( she was late for work , had rude attitude and threw my check at me ) ...my food was cold ...it was good but cold ...."}
{"text":"We had a great time at this new place...sat at the bar and enjoyed sushi rolls, squid salad, gyoza and amazing cocktails that compliment the food.  Staff and owner were incredibly friendly and gracious.  Prices were reasonable and portion sizes large.  Best place for sushi we've found in Scottsdale!  You won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"This place is awesome, good sushi and more laid back atmosphere than surrounding sushi joints. My girlfriend and I have been going at least one a week since we found it. We always get the same spot at the sushi bar and the people are great. Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"We have eaten there now 3 times since they opened. They have amazing lunch specials and happy hour specials. I love the veggie tempura and chicken teriyaki dishes. I personally don't eat sushi, but my dad, whom is very picky, loved the spicy tuna and whatever the other roll he got was. I live right in the area and am so glad to have found this place. The people are also very nice that work there. We have always been promptly served and never had to wait for refills or the bill. It's a must try!!!"}
{"text":"The food at Bei is AMAZING - I am a huge sushi fan and I would venture to say that the sushi at Bei is the best I've had in Arizona. I came here with a date on Thursday for the first time and the place was lovely. They had live music and a very cool atmosphere; the decor is very pretty. We were impressed! We ordered several rolls, some basic, like the tootsie and the spicy tuna, as well as the dragon and ASU roll. All of them tasted amazing. The ingredients at Bei are INCREDIBLY fresh; the fish is the best quality I've had in AZ and there's a delicious balance and texture to all of it. The rolls themselves were also extremely well-made; very tight and neat. ALSO the green tea ice cream is to die for. 

We will definitely be returning to Bei. The food came out quickly and, like I've been raving, it is of EXTREMELY high quality. The only blemish on the night was that while the service was relatively speedy, our particular waitress was distant and a little stand-offish; she almost never came to check on our table and when she did, she was cold and walked away almost immediately, before we could even tell her if we needed anything. Other servers who were around, whoever, were very kind and very pleasant, so I won't let that deter me from going back. Viva la Bei!"}
{"text":"This is THE best sushi I've ever had. They have very very generous portions, and great prices. The octopus is delicious. But my favorite of the night was the scallop roll. 

The service was good, it was pretty dead in there when we came in and we got attended to very quickly. Even when the place started getting busy our server Gary was excellent. Will definitely be coming here again, hopefully sooner than later."}
{"text":"Great spot. We often go for the late happy hour (9pm-close) and get a couple appetizers and Sake bombs. Appetizers are $3-7."}
{"text":"Bommmmbbbb!!!! Sushi is so good, so are the garlic ediname!! Our server kelsey was so nice and cute. If you love sushi come here!!"}
{"text":"Food was great. The service was really quick. Also was really friendly when our group was super disorganized!"}
{"text":"Super friendly, fast service. Waitress came by often to remove our empty dishes. Sushi is on point and hit the spot. Lots of vegan options for my gf. As we were leaving at least 3-4 staff members from different parts of the restaurant thanked us or said goodbye. Love this place."}
{"text":"I went to Bei with my sister on Sunday 8/10.  We got two lunch specials - each included two rolls and a bowl of soup.  Rolls were very good and the soup was, also.  Price was good - $8-9 for this per order.  have yet to check it out for happy hour but will be back.  hope they pick up more business - it's right next to Frashers but kind of obscure in a no-named little strip mall.  our server was very nice and attentive and the food came out in a timely manner but no one else was there.  bar area seems large and they have TV's for sports!  asparagus veggie roll was delish!!!"}
{"text":"My second visit here... Food: fabulous, service: fast and friendly, atmosphere: comfortable, music: canned techno... Loud enough to make it impossible to overhear other convos, quiet enough to hear yourself think. Had the tuna lover's roll and the spicy salmon, both were super fresh and yummy. I'll be back!"}
{"text":"Visiting Scottsdale and decided to try this spot for lunch. They have some great lunch specials like bento boxes and sashimi/roll combos. 
Service was prompt and the waitress was attentive.
They have numerous TVs around the bar area, which was great to watch the games that were on. 
The small salad they give you with your bento box was ok. Way too much dressing for my liking-there was a small lake of dressing at the bottom of my salad bowl when I was done eating the lettuce. The miso soup was really good and hot! Not lukewarm like some miso soup you get at other spots. 
The sushi and bento box was great! The bento box was big and had plenty of food in it! Overall, a great sushi spot and great prices!"}
{"text":"Not horrible. That is actually a compliment from me when talking about a japanese restaurant. I eat sushi at least once a week and have tried almost every joint in the valley not to mention many around the country. I have eaten sushi in the sushi Mecca of the Tsukiji fish market in Tokyo. Bei isn't horrible just average leveling up there with stingray and Ra although less expensive. The sushi is Americanized but I appreciated their miso soup and gyoza. Not bad for a quick bite in south Scottsdale."}
{"text":"Excellent! I would highly recommend this place for its fresh and large cuts of fish, great prices, and pleasant atmosphere. The owner was present during our visit and was very attentive to all of the tables. As a sushi lover, I didn't think you could get quality sushi in the middle of the desert but this place proved me wrong. Coming back on my next trip to Arizona."}
{"text":"I was at Bei to celebrate my birthday. Everything was really great, the food was good, the fish was fresh, great service, and  friendly staff."}
{"text":"Usually love eating here, and I love its small atmosphere. Was really disappointed when we went there last though. The small Asian lady behind the bar took forever to get us just menus. She literally laid them down and Never came back. We work in the industry so we didn't even say anything, just figured they were short staffed or something. It wasn't until one guy came in and she walked up to him right away, laid down his silverware, menus, grabbed his drink order, gave him his drink, and still never came to us! We were sitting right next to him too! She just picked up our menus and walked away! It was at that moment that we decided to leave. I only gave it an extra star because we've had decent service in the past."}
{"text":"Greta sushi spot! Good happy hour! Spicy poke bowl was very fresh and good. Green tea v excellent!"}
{"text":"Bei is definitely my favorite spot for sushi in the Phoenix-Scottsdale area. The happy hours are generous and the volcano rolls are delicious. I've spent far too many nights here enjoying good sushi and Kirin. 

The appetizers are also delicious-- haven't tried the main dishes yet but why should I when the sushi is so good."}
{"text":"This place is pretty good! The miso soup was a little salty but I like that. The salad was bitter, so we didn't finish it. Our rolls were amazing! Everything came out promptly and such. Our waiter was super friendly and respectful. 

My only disses would be our soy sauce dispenser had a leak, the music was to clubish, and you could see the separation between where the seat met the couch, so it was a little dirty. Lastly, the orange on my Blue Moon was pretty dried out!"}
{"text":"After trying a lot of sushi place, I find Bei and I love it. The sushi are excellent. It's my new favorite spot!"}
{"text":"Best happy hour around! Happy hour was long and had many options, not just the unpopular items. Great and quick service! My water glass was never empty."}
{"text":"My family has our traditional sushi place in Phoenix, which has now closed (RIP Sushi on Shea!). This was our attempt to replace it. Although there are not a large number of particularly fancy rolls, the sushi was well-made and super tasty. The salads were reasonably priced and had lots of fish on them (especially the spicy tuna salad, which is amazing!). The Green Bei Roll will be something I will go back to again and again. The servers were very attentive and food came out very quickly."}
{"text":"Not only do they have arguably the best sushi in town but the customer service is also five star. Very friendly and accommodating, even when I ordered after they had shut down the kitchen, they still took my to go order. That's what keeps people coming back...and the Bei special roll."}
{"text":"A more than decent place to grab some sushi on the cheap. The tempura jalepeño appetizer was our favorite. The Las Vegas and Tuna Lover rolls were both delicious, and service was quick and efficient. I would definitely return when visiting the Scottsdale area."}
{"text":"The food is great here.  Suggestion for to-go noodle soup: separate the noodle and the soup in a different containers.  I ordered to-go once that the noodles are already in the soup,  after I got home, the noodles are over cooked..as it been keep cooking itself in the hot soup.  Hope this will improve.  The rice bowls are nice with veggies.  I don't like the wasabi here, it is kinda fake wasabi."}
{"text":"My daughter wanted sushi for her 18th birthday so we decided to check out this new place just up the road.  We will be back!  Quick friendly service and a great happy hour menu but best was the excellent sushi!"}
{"text":"The Desert Sunset is by far my favorite roll. Quite possibly my favorite I have ever had. It is a little pricey, and I wish they had all you can eat cause I could certainly partake in that."}
{"text":"Best sushi in Scottsdale, great prices and great atmosphere. The salmon was really fresh and everything tasted great. Look forward to coming here again!"}
{"text":"Hands down one of the best sushi places anywhere!!! Everything is fresh and high quality"}
{"text":"This is my new sushi spot. I am a big fan of the volcano roll. And they're pop stickers are to die for. The staff is very friendly it is a relaxed environment. I have been eating at this place for the past 2 weeks almost 3 times a week. It is seriously that good. I tried miso soup for the first time and it was delicious. Plus they gave me extra seaweed but they can hold the tofu. I like the fact that they have a rotating happy hour menu so you get a chance to try a lot of rolls. I definitely recommend trying the Vegas roll and the volcano roll."}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite places to eat when traveling to Scottsdale. Just awesome food. I dream about the stuffed mushrooms!!! The prices are so great and the presentation is impressive. Took some colleagues with me and now they are nuts over this place as well. You will not be disappointed. Tried a new place tonight and was so disappointed, should have gone here. I will the rest of my trip."}
{"text":"I've always enjoyed Bei, but today was possibly the last time I come here. I came in to order carry-out. I could have called in an order but to be honest, I didn't know what I wanted. Plus, orders at any sushi place normally come out pretty quick. Not today.

I arrived slightly before 5:00pm. Made my order of three vegetarian sushi rolls. Order came out at 5:27pm. All in all, about a 40min wait time. Seeing as how I didn't order anything crazy (just straight off the menu), nothing tempura, and no meat that needed cooked... why would it take 40 minutes to get me three rolls with vegetables on them?

The place wasn't busy - maybe 3 small groups of people in the restaurant. So I can't make myself say that they were just slammed and my order was down the list due the sheer volume of food they were putting out. No, they were just ungodly slow.

As I sat there I was wondering if I was dining in if they would have had me wait that long.

In any case, I guess I'm off to look for another sushi place in my area."}
{"text":"Sushi was okay. Other food was pretty good. Service was good. Ambience was ... loud. Seemed pricy for what is essentially a sports bar. Worst turn-off: sake was served lukewarm."}
{"text":"We had a good visit here! I was thinking this was going to be a hip, modern Asian fusion-y type of sushi joint. I think it wanted to be, but the shopping center location and cheap feeling ambiance sort of detracted from that possibility. 

The food however, is good! I would definitely suggest, if you want a low-key nite, to come here. Everyone liked what they had and the prices were good. The ambiance is nothing special (and the music which attempts to make this place feel hipper than it is, is kind of silly). It's more of a 3.5, but I really liked the food and the price so we'll give it a 4! Nothing too exciting, nice staff, good food...if you are looking for hip, fun vibe, it's not the place..."}
{"text":"Note: Sushi Hot Spot

Recently stopped in for lunch. Benton box and some Mochi Ice Cream. 

Food is exceptional. I'm just a white guy married to a Japanese beauty so I can't speak of the mother land, but this seems pretty legit to me.

Service is wonderful. Pleasant, well informed.

Interior is odd as others have said. Maybe they should remodel the entry?

Minor changes would make a good upgrade."}
{"text":"As someone who eats a fair amount of sushi and goes through a number of cravings for good fish, I probably should have known better than to make my first visit to Bei on a Sunday night with a hankering in my belly. But so I did, and my results were less than spectacular.

First and foremost, the whole vibe of the place is a bit disjointed. You walk into a bar area with a couple of TVs playing, one of those cheesy neon chalkboards proclaiming the drink specials, and two types of music coming at you, one of which seemed to be fairly mellow, the other an overly bass-heavy offering of hip-hop and EDM.

Maybe I didn't do enough looking when I went in, but I didn't even realize this place had a sushi bar to sit at; as a party of one my attention was drawn to the bar which is prominent upon entering. There are some booths and then a wall that obstructs the view of most of the restaurant and the aforementioned sushi bar, which is where I generally prefer to sit.

My first concern was that I was presented with a rocks glass to drink my beer out of something I don't generally see. The service was decent if distracted at times, but I had no issues getting my order in with relative ease. 

As for the food, everything just felt a bit off. Some of the rolls were overly wet, the bowl of rice was much too dry, and the fish--while decent--lacked that upper level taste and presentation. My sashimi was served on some sort of leaves laid over a plastic bowl of ice.

By the end of my meal, I was left trying to figure out exactly what Bei is trying to be, something that the restaurant itself seems confused by. Is it a RA-like hangout/clubby feel, is it a traditional Japanese restaurant, or is it a neighborhood place to come to, have a few beers and watch TV?

Instead of trying to be everything, I would rather Bei pick one, stick to it and do it well. The music and conflicting sounds were enough to have me not wanting to return; the food didn't do much to overcome that, though it wasn't the worst I've ever had and seems to show the most promise. The menu is a bit roll heavy, but that seems to be the norm here so I can sort of overlook that, but I would really love to see the sashimi and sushi given the majority of attention. I'd also be interested in exploring the rest of the menu to see how it stacks up.

A return to Bei is a definite maybe, though I fear it may only confirm my feelings that this restaurant is trying to be too many things and succeeding at none of them."}
{"text":"Reverse happy hour is great!!! Great prices and delicious food!! We loved their teriyaki and sweet and sour chicken bowls. And the sashimi and rolls have been above par!! This is our new go-to sushi joint! And it's a half mile from home, so we're super stoked!! :)"}
{"text":"This place is awesome! The service was top notch and our waitress was spectacular! The food was delicious and didn't break the bank for myself and two others. Coming back to this place again!"}
{"text":"Excellent service, fast and very delicious. Came in during happy hour for some good deals! I ordered the green bei and my girlfriend the volcano roll. Both were awesome!"}
{"text":"Great food, clean/modern atmosphere and a great happy hour! Can't beat this place for the area, quality and price!"}
{"text":"Bei is such a funny little place, but the food was GREAT and the service was just as good. D Money served us, and my wife and I really enjoyed our night. The edamame is  as is their volcano roll."}
{"text":"A nice stop for lunch, with friendly staff and good food. I sat at the bar and order the lunch special which is reasonable prices and good portioned. Plenty of seating with good space.

the rolls I ordered were fresh and flavorful, great selection of Japanese beer and wines to complement.

Worth a stop if you have a sushi craving!"}
{"text":"This is our go-to spot! Love all the sushi and appetizers. Great service and super nice staff! Bei = bae"}
{"text":"Great casual sushi bar with fantastic food. If you want to skip the high prices but still want well executed sushi, this is the place. Nice range for both purists and people who like to experiment."}
{"text":"I am happy to find this place. First because I know the owner from the past and he's a really cool guy. But I didn't know that he owns this place until I came in and devoured every sushi roll. haha. 

We came after Happy Hours so our bill was on the pricey side. But looks like happy hour menu is not bad, drinks are pretty good. I love the yogurt martini, Korean signature. :)

Sushi was awesome. portion was very generous.High quality rice and fish, veggies were fresh. 

The ambience is great. it's a huge restaurant! you have separated sushi bar area, dinning area and sport area, at least that's how I felt anyways.

I guess the only one thing I think Bei can improve is the hostess. The guy clearly didn't know what he was doing, I am sorry. He seems sort of frustrated even though the restaurant wasn't that packed when we got there. The bartender girl was nice, but obviously was irritated by the hostess, and that showed. 

Good restaurant, good food. Perfect for a Friday night get-together. :)"}
{"text":"Good food 
Great service by Ella 
Great happy hour

Place has the best salmon nigiri and chicken teriyaki"}
{"text":"The staff gets annoyed at you if you're regulars and I don't know why because that's money for the business. But they get annoyed if you visit regularly. The food can be a hit or miss when I come in. But for the most part it's \"eh.\" They only have Simple traditional/stereotypical \"Safe\" or \"Basic\" sushi dishes. Nothing Special to set them apart from other fast chain sushi restaurants.  I wish they didn't put imitation crab in ALL of their sushi dishes. They don't have real crab in their sushi and a majority of their sushi's have the same ingredients! They just arrange the ingredients in different order and they all have imitation crab in them. Food prices are cheap, but all of their sushi's taste the same and have all the same exact ingredients. The water taste soo NASTY. It tasted like sewer and was dirty and grey. It made me sick. Will never be going there again."}
{"text":"First time coming here. It was amazing! I usually hit up RA sushi down the road from this place but I think this might be my new sushi spot. The workers were very nice! The food was very delicious! The Roll Royce Roll waa to die for. You definitely need to try this place!"}
{"text":"Not bad at all.  Sat in the general dining area.  Had some nigiri and tempura.  Chili edamame is great.  Tempura also great, not over-breaded.  Sushi was very good.  Service and attitude great."}
{"text":"Great sushi and great prices! Their happy hour menu is quite large. Not only is the food great but the service is on point too. Always friendly and quick. Would highly recommend Bei!"}
{"text":"I tried seven types of nigiri and Tempura Udon. All were super fresh and really good. I'm Japanese, and the restaurant serves the best Japanese food in Arizona!"}
{"text":"Awesome sushi, fun environment, and great happy hour specials. Our server, Ella, was super friendly and helpful."}
{"text":"First off the sign is very small. Maybe because of the name but the place is pretty big inside and clean.  Got greeted immediately and was attended to for drinks and ordering. Got the free miso soup offer from yelp. Small bowl but really good. Ordered off the lunch special and got the tempura box and was completely full. Will need to go back for just the sushi to see if I can give more stars. Received a free California sushi card from our waiter which was nice.  Ordered a beer which I was a bit expensive for $5 a bottle."}
{"text":"Came here for the happy hour! It was great! I don't think it is that common to have nigiri on happy hour so we really liked that! Sushi was good they have creative tools and staff was friendly!"}
{"text":"So good! Excellent service! This service was absolutely amazing! I really enjoyed the atmosphere this sounds in the sights of Scottsdale road! The food was even more amazing!"}
{"text":"Don't think about it, just make the drive and order your favorite type of sushi. Sushi is just the tip of the iceberg. Ramen, chicken wings, sake, and much, much more. Haven't written a review in a while, let alone on my anniversary. Wifey picked out the place and man we lucked out.  We have a dinner reservation planned at a 5 star steak house tonight and I am not sure the steak house will beat this quality.  All I can say is.... WOW!!! This is not the quality you would expect in the middle of the desert.  

PS: they use real crab in their rolls not imitation."}
{"text":"Bei is my favorite Sushi joint in the area! The late night happy hour menu is super convenient and has so many good options. I especially enjoy the Scallop Dynamite Roll and Las Vegas Roll. Highly suggest eating here!"}
{"text":"I had the best experience at this place. I was at my scottsdale home and saw this pop up on Yelp and I love sushi just scared of trying new places. I took 10 of my friends that were in town and we spent about 200$ here It amazing and the workers were funny and having fun serving us cracking jokes and stuff. The sushi was good the seating was good and it was fast. Literally we were in and out with no hassle. Just a great job. I don't get why their is bad reviews for family owned places. Show this place some support and go in and try their sushi! Wish I could give them more than just 5 stars lol."}
{"text":"I came seeking an affordable fix for sushi and located this jewel beyond Old Town.  The June happy hour pricing is quite appealing which was what drew me in.  One of my hobbies is locating great deals on sushi happy hours, which was how I located this place.  Service was timely and I enjoyed my dinner within 15 minutes.  The music is appropriately tuned vs blasting folks aggressively with Top 40 music like Ra shamelessly does.  The bar is appealing in design, even with two bar counters for sushi and drinks.  This place is a local jewel vs another yuppie establishment, catering to the clever and adventurous crowd.  Check this out one free evening as the pace is relaxed.  The block may look a little rough, but the interior  of the restaurant is where the action is!"}
{"text":"Great sushi, tried a few different ones during happy hour. Will definitely be back. The jalapeño hibachi roll was my favorite, the heat was awesome. Got miso soup as an appetizer that was a little salty but still delicious"}
{"text":"A gem!  Very fresh and clean.  Sushi of your choice doesn't disappoint!  This is my second time here and it won't be the last!"}
{"text":"Went here before going to old town with some friends... I had the Nebraska Roll and let me just say, probably some of the best sushi I have had! I also had the egg rolls for an appetizer and those were pretty great too. It is a pretty casual laid back atmosphere. Wait staff was good. Will definitely be visiting in the near future!"}
{"text":"The service was fast and friendly and the food was great. We were a party of 11 and fit comfortably. All the food was served for everyone in less than 15 minutes. I highly recommend!"}
{"text":"The staff is really friendly and quick. I usually split the blazing alaska (my favorite because of the thin sliced jalapeño) and another roll like a spicy salmon. The happy hour deals are pretty unbeatable and the lunch sashimi special is a good deal as well.

I wish they had less cream cheese integrated in the menu but that's just me. A lot of people really enjoy the cream cheese filled rolls. 

Also a good place for take out if you live in the area."}
{"text":"Yum yum yum! This place is in a super weird location, but oh my gosh, the sushi is fantastic. I'm not a huge sushi connoisseur, but I eat it from time to time, and the roll I had here was honestly the best sushi roll I've ever had. My husband LOVED his, too, he had the Las Vegas and Golden Philly roll and raved about both. The wait staff is also super nice and attentive. Make sure to go for happy hour, too - fantastic prices on rolls! Can't say anything bad about the place."}
{"text":"We love coming here! It's our weekly spot. The salmon nigiri is excellent!  Ella is awesome!  One of our favorite servers!!!"}
{"text":"The sashimi Omakase was excellent, fresh and plentiful. Great surprise to find such good sushi in Phoenix."}
{"text":"Fantastic atmosphere. Friendly staff, seated super quick. The bei mushrooms have to be one of my favorites. We ordered chicken katsu. Amazing! Location is ideal. Soup and salad! Invite your friends and famil. Have an adventure and head to bei!! Thank you for being one of the best restaurants i. Old Town. Beautiful restaurant, soothing, modern colors and textures."}
{"text":"Pretty straightforward sushi here and they add a good amount of fish in the rolls. We started off with miso soup- good not too over salty, house salad the ginger dressing was weak, Jalapeno Hamachi- decent. Our favorite was the Tuna Lover- yummy! Good flavor didn't even need a dip in the soy sauce. Also had the Michigan roll since it is made with cucumber (no rice) great option. The highlight was the butterfish sashimi - oh my melts in your mouth and was fresh! I would recommend this local sushi spot, it's off the beaten path in a old shopping plaza. They have plenty of TVs to watch your sports team, the only thing that was disturbing was their speakers, they were playing top 40 music but it was horribly muffled and sounded like a speaker in water. It would be nice to have a clean sound system going while enjoying your meal. The bowls look good too, maybe next we will try."}
{"text":"Great happy hour! Ambiance is relaxed and clean.
 Here with a friend who says she always has a good experience here."}
{"text":"Pretty good sushi here. Their sashimi portions are small for the price. But everything tasted great. They even have escolar. Yum!"}
{"text":"This place always keeps me coming for more.  The rainbow roll is my favorite and the Las Vegas roll is to die for."}
{"text":"Plenty of space. Good happy hour deals. Plenty of parking. Sushi was mediocre. We got the Las Vegas Roll and the Spicy Tuna Roll. The Spicy Chicken Noodle bowl was really good. Took a while to get water and the place wasn't busy at all."}
{"text":"Very very happy with our beverages, soup, appetizer& entrees!   Extra bonus was our sweet waitress, Kelsie & the rose for Valentine's Day!  Definitely will return!"}
{"text":"Great place for happy hour especially with friends. There happy hour has a great selection of choices to chose from. Also their sake bomb it is fun drinking it with others if you catch my drift."}
{"text":"Probably my favorite Japanese food in south Scottsdale. I get udon noodles and they are to die for. Also you can post mates BEI it's amazing!!!"}
{"text":"A hidden gem in South Scottsdale. Excellent food and very attentive service. Check it out!!"}
{"text":"Originally I was skeptical of this place because of the exterior appearance. However, I should not have judged this book by its cover. 

The service was exceptional. The sushi was fresh and delicious. The decor inside was very modern and clean. 

The only reason I did not give this a 5 star is because I have not had enough time to try more on the menu or let the chefs create their own off the menu plates. 

I will definitely return here."}
{"text":"Bei happy hour is great, gyoza, vegas rolls, mochi and sake bombs. The sushi is bomb and our server Tikra was fantastic. This is a regular spot of ours, solid miso soup."}
{"text":"I really loved this place and I'm not even that crazy for sushi. They have these pork stuff things that are amazing and they make a sushi roll that is covered with fried shrimp!!! What midwestern boy can turn that down? Not this one. The service is impeccable as well. Bei is a great place to go with bae"}
{"text":"This used to be a Restaurant called Lao Thai- which I liked but they recently changed it to a AWESOME Sushi Restaurant called Bei.  The atmosphere was very nice and clean.  The food was INCREDIBLE at Bei and now I find myself craving it all the time!

I must say that it doesn't look like much from the outside.  It is in an old strip mall in the \"seedy\" side of Scottsdale but the food, service and atmosphere was top notch!

I highly recommend it!  They have a very inviting Sushi Bar and I like the fact that they always have some of sports on the bar flat screen TV.

Great place for a first date!  The pricing was perfect and I am always full and satisfied when I leave there!"}
{"text":"Really love this place. Out of the way. Worth it. Good food. Great beer. Plenty of parking."}
{"text":"You Yelpers have led me astray. The ambiance was not what I expected for a nice meal out, we're here for Spring Training, but proceeded to a booth since the reviews were so high.

My boyfriend and I ordered the Spicy Alaska Roll and Scottsdale Roll, Beef Teriyaki entree, and the chicken rice bowl. We didn't finish either roll or any of our main dishes. I'm not a huge fan when dishes are soaked in sauce, drenching the rice. I thought rice was supposed to be white? 

You know when you usually eat sushi and every bite you should get that \"oh-my-God-this-is-f'ing-amazing\" as you're chewing? Ya... that failed to happen. I just picked it apart. Overall just very disappointed in spending $60 on this meal. It was all just so damn bland. 

As my boyfriend so eloquently stated, the hotdogs at the game were better than this place. Well said my friend, well said."}
{"text":"Good sushi and good deals for happy hour! The house sake was delicious. Salmon nigiri was small but for the cheap price I can't complain. Good ambience and nice staff!"}
{"text":"We went here with some friends last night before going out to Mill. We heard good thing so we were pretty excited to try it. The bathroom should have been my first sign of what was to come. It was gross, plain and simple. I just ignored it and continued on with my night. They food was all good, not the most flavorful but not bad. 

Now on to today. My fiancée and I have some of the worst food poisoning from this place. We are both too sick to move."}
{"text":"I love Bei! My boyfriend and I go often! Great sushi (I recommend the sunshine roll) friendly staff, good happy hour deals and a local mom and pop feel! Definitely check it out:)"}
{"text":"Stopped in for the reverse happy hour shortly after 9:00 on a Friday evening, fairly full house but still had seats available at the bar and a few in the dining room.  Good happy hour prices for the standard generic rolls staggered pricing for the more specialized rolls, enjoyed them all.  Staff seemed a little green but not an issue, we all started somewhere."}
{"text":"This is a very good place for happy hour. They have a special menu that changes monthly so Check-out their website for the list. 
We ordered several roles - we liked the volcano roll the best. You can also check in Yelp to get a free miso soup.
My husband ordered the sashimi platter and it came with a grilled fish that was delicious.
The place is deceptively big on the inside so don't let the outside dissuade you from visiting this restaurant."}
{"text":"I ordered here on doordash. It was really good. The Tuna sashimi salad was great. The philly roll was good as well. Good sushi rice that's not mushy. I would order take out from here again."}
{"text":"Discovered this place on Yelp so checked it out a month ago with a friend.  Since then, been back 3 times already.  It's kind of unassuming given it's in the shopping mall and nothing outside seems to scream 'come on in' about it.  I don't know if it's the best but I had others highly reviewed sushi joints and they were just ok.  The attentiveness and customer service here is just right.  Not bothersome but always there when I need something.  Don't believe the owners are Japs but who cares when I can get a damn cold Asahi with good sashimi right?"}
{"text":"Happy hour is a great deal! Got two rolls for under $13. I got the sashimi meal and it was a little expensive for the amount you get, but great quality fish and taste overall. The hot sake was $2.50 during happy hour and was delicious. There are lots of sushi, appetizers, and drink specials on the happy hour menu! Service was good. Not too busy, but it's early for dinner on a Monday. I definitely recommend this place."}
{"text":"While this is a sushi place, there was a strong fishy smell that was unpleasant. Had the yellow tail roll which was bland and tasteless, the mi so soup was on the salty side but otherwise, ok. The seaweed salad was below average. My date had the eel with rice bowl and barely touched it.  While the server was polite, hardly came by and had to walk to the server station to ask for the check. Won't be back."}
{"text":"Came here during happy hour. We were greeted right away and the staff was friendly and attentive. The food came quickly and was beautifully presented. Good portion for the value. Everything from the salad (loved the taste!), to the miso soup, to the sushi was delicious and fresh. The ambiance had a good vibe and music matched the overall groove of the space."}
{"text":"This is my review/what I wrote to the management (and they never responded)

Hello Bei representative,

Myself and my wife recently visited your restaurant and I am shocked and horrified to inform you of our experience.

We were kindly and quickly greeted and seated and it was down hill immediately once our server took over.

Our server, Cody, took approximately 10 minutes to arrive, greet us and take our drink order.  His poor and careless attitude were immediately made clear to us.  He took our drink order and vanished for an overly extended period of time.  Eventually, another waiter noticed something was not right and came over to check on us and brought us our drinks.  The waiter then went and found Cody, who then came over and took our food order with his poor attitude and rude demeanor.  We were a little confused about the menu pricing so Cody informed us that \"the management does not know what they are doing and won't change the menu to be clear to customers\".  That was a very disrespectful comment about his superiors (regardless of the situation) and quite shocking to us.

Here is where things become horrific.


From where we were seated, we could see inside the kitchen (behind the black curtain) and witnessed Cody sitting on the counter-tops and sneakily eating edamame where customer's food comes out.  As we continued to watch, we learned that Cody was actually eating food off customer's plates before he would bring the dish to the customer's table.  This is absolutely horrendous, disgusting and unacceptable so I decided to both photograph and film these acts.

I was praying that he would have been filled with food by the time our food was prepared so he would not eat off of our plates.  Cody did in fact eat off of our appetizer plate (edamame) and I was so upset that I decided not to confront anybody during our visit.  We did not touch our appetizer and the entire experience was horrific.  I am writing to tell you this now and I request that action be taken on this matter.

Thanks in advance for your attention to this matter."}
{"text":"This place is delicious for happy hour! Really great sushi and great prices. My favorite rolls are the Las Vegas roll and the Alaska roll."}
{"text":"First time trying Hawaiian poke, came here for sushi rolls and also ordered the poke bowls. Food was excellent, and ahi tuna poke's first experience was great. Definitely coming back!"}
{"text":"Great happy hour! The sushi is pretty good and love the low prices. Cheap sake bombs too which is lit"}
{"text":"Not overly impressed with this place, but I would give a 3.5 star if I could. The sushi was just a little above average and the service was slow. I had high expectations since everyone has mentioned this place but I didn't taste or experience anything above average. They had a good selection of nigiri and rolls and food was fresh but I felt like the service took a really long time. I may try to make the happy hour next time."}
{"text":"We came in when dinner service was just starting. Service was surprisingly quick and the staff was very friendly. It is not a place to go if you are looking for authentic traditional sushi but more for having a good time for friends or a date. Love that they have an open bar and all three main Japanese beers. The flavor isn't going to blow you out of this world but it's still a nice environment to have fun in."}
{"text":"Really great flavors and courteous staff. Great happy hour menu. My new favorite sushi spot."}
{"text":"We had the crab stuffed mushrooms which were very different from what I'd imagined.  Its basically a large ball of crab with a little mushroom on it (think crab ball with hat) covered in panko and fried.  Sounds weird, but its actually pretty dang good.  Its a little tricky to eat but I'd definitely recommend trying it if you like crab.

We also had the spicy salmon, spicy tuna, shrimp tempura, and one that I don't remember the name of..  They were decent, slightly too much rice and slightly off in the slicing but priced very right even without a special.

If you're in the mood for sushi in a bistro type environment versus a club and don't want to be reamed on pricing I would highly recommend this place!"}
{"text":"Food is good but today service was not so good. Our server tonight was Seo Hee was in la la land. We came in at 1830, waited 10 mins for our server to come and ask for drinks. Then waited another 15 mins for our tab. We saw her texting behind the bar. She only came by to check up on us once. Granted, it was not busy therefore she should have been more attentive."}
{"text":"Awesome service, fresh sushi, great prices especially during happy hour, atmosphere is nice and relaxing."}
{"text":"Some of the best sushi I have personally ever had. Their salmon melts in your mouth. You won't regret coming here!"}
{"text":"Bei is my new bae! Great service and tasty food! I had the noodle and rice bowl combo (Spicy Chicken Noodle and Bulgogi Bowl. I asked the server if it was going to be smaller portions because it was a combo. He said no, it's the same size as a regular. I was in shock and said nah, it can't be. He brought it over and it was definitely a regular size! It's really two meals. Even though I was a Hungry Bear, I couldn't finish it. Now, I have leftovers. And, really for less than $15 with tax, what a good deal! I definitely recommend trying this restaurant."}
{"text":"This was the first time I came here and this place is very deceiving.  From the outside it looks like a hole in a wall sushi joint but once you go in boom everything is modern.  They have a bar area with TV's to watch the game and then a separate area for dine in.  They have a great ambiance and every booth/ table is evenly placed to have the right intimate atmosphere.

We came during happy hour and they have a ton of items on the happy hour menu.  It ranges from beer, sake bombs, appetizers, nigiri sushi, and some specialty rolls.  I extremely was surprised by their stuffed mushroom. It was to die for!!! I loved it so much I had to order it twice.  

The service was very pleasant.  Our waiter was very nice and had a great sense of humor.  They made sure my drink never hit the bottom and was very honest with their recommendation on items.

Only reason I didn't give it a full 5 star is because I didn't try any nigiri.  It's very important to have fresh fish. Next time i go back I will try it but for now 4 star it is!"}
{"text":"Best happy hour! Yum!! This is our go to for miso and dinner on those nights we don't feel like cooking."}
{"text":"Awesome neighborhood spot if you're looking for a quick bite to eat. Go during Happy Hour! Walked out of there full and spent less than $10! Almost has a bit of a sports bar vibe - you walk in facing the bar and there are high top tables and TVs. Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Took the family to lunch at Bei.  Very disappointing experience after seeing all those 4/5 stars review.

This is a typical Americanized Japanese restaurant.  Sushi/regular dishes were nothing special.  Perhaps my expectation was too high after reading the Yelp reviews.  I was expecting much higher quality like Hiro Sushi.

Service was so-so as well.  Had to ask for things multiple times to get a response.  Check came quickly enough though.  I guess it's time for the server to take a break."}
{"text":"Really great sushi! I highly recommend the butterfish sushi, so amazing! Happy hour is super cheap and 4-7"}
{"text":"I've been wanting to try this place for a while and man was it worth the wait!  My husband and I came during happy hour. Happy hour is until 7pm!!  That's plenty of time to enjoy your food without rushing to put an order in before it ends. Love it. Miso soup is tasty. The rolls Royce roll was my favorite and the Jessica albacore roll was my husbands (obvious)
Can't wait to come back and bring my daughters. They will love this place also!!"}
{"text":"The wonderful reviews of Bei were all of a sudden verified when we walked through the doors to multiple staff members looking up from what they were doing to smile and greet us.

Our server, Manami, was so friendly! After we had narrowed down our selections to the Arizona and Volcano rolls, she suggested the Checkerboard Roll, which was the piece de resistance of the evening! The combination of the tuna, Escolar, shrimp tempura, and wasabi aioli was absolutely delicious and I look forward to having it again soon.

Thank you for the great service and delicious food!"}
{"text":"I have ate here twice and I have NO complaints. 

The service starts as soon as you walk through the front door, as it should. After being greeted and thanked for coming in, we are ushered to our seats. The menu has everything you could imagine! Bento boxes, fresh Maki rolls, and every kind of Nigiri conceivable. We ordered the Sweet Potato Roll, the Nebraska roll, Tuna/Salmon/Yellowtail Nigiri, and a Vegas roll.

The prices are the only thing that can beat how FAST the food came out. Within ordering, we had our food, all four rolls, at our ready. 

I will be coming back here again and again and again!"}
{"text":"Ordered take out and they told me 15 minutes so I arrived on time but had to wait about 5 extra minutes which wasn't a big deal. I had two rolls both were fresh, they lacked a bit of flavor but nothing some soy sauce can't fix. Will be back."}
{"text":"Best sushi spot in town! Fresh fish, delicious seaweed salad, and sake! We come here all the time for happy hour and always leave satisfied. It's our local secret!"}
{"text":"I was impressed.  Went with my daughter for dinner on a Friday night.  Got seated right away and we ordered everything that sounded good - California rolls, Spicy Salmon Roll, Fried Tofu appetizer, Bulgoki beef, miso soup...

Everything was delicious except the Bulgoki beef.  Didn't like the texture or flavor at all.  Told the waiter and he was so great about taking it back and removing it from our bill.

Will come back!"}
{"text":"I recently visited this restaurant and was exceptionally pleased by the experience. I am always looking for new places to enjoy sushi, and saw the reviews on here were nearly flawless. Obviously I had my doubts that this was clearly a manufactured coincidence so I had to do some investigating of my own. 

To my surprise though BEI justified it's reviews. I ordered yellow tail sashimi, very large and fresh pieces were presented elegantly within minutes of placing my order. Next the three rolls I ordered came out in a timely fashion. One at a time and almost as soon as I finished the previous roll.  I've recently experienced a different situation at another local sushi restaurant where my food was brought out with absolutely no order. Dinner first then, last appetizers and when I ordered another roll it took about 30 minutes to arrive. 

The three rolls I ordered were the ASU, Tuna Lover and my new favorite roll The Checkerboard roll. The wasabi aioli sauce on top of the Checkerboard roll was to die for. I highly recommend  it.

Also as many other people have commented about and I feel must be address is the quality of service. Everyone was extremely nice, polite, and knowledgable. It's clear their employes love working there and when I asked how long they have been in business, accompanied with a large smile, I received a very confident and prideful response of 13 weeks today. 

I rarely frequent restaurants but this one is sure be see the likes of me in the near future 

Advice to you, Give this place a shot and what ever you do, try anything with their aioli sauce."}
{"text":"The sushi here is really bland, absolutely no flavor.  I decided to try this place because I had a coupon and it's close to my house.  I had to force myself to finish my roll and salmon nigiri. Bad, just bad."}
{"text":"First. I have to thank our server for accommodating to my shellfish allergy and communication with the kitchen. I know. I know. It seems stupid to go to a restaurant which you are allergic to 3/4 of the menu items and then have them work around it. Good food, HH is amazing and service is beyond point."}
{"text":"Sashimi and sushi is so fresh even cooked meals are impeccable, absolutely recommend for a date night or a quick easy meal you don't want to cook."}
{"text":"It's alright. Not enough fish in rolls so somehow pricy for the quality. Happy hour late night is a better deal. Service is good. BTW, I think whole food sushi is better  than theirs (cheaper, fresher and bigger chunks)."}
{"text":"Seaweed salad and mackerel nigiri were fantastic. Salmon nigiri was not the best cut of fish. Ponzu sauce was some of the best I've had in a while. Would definitely come back next time I'm in town."}
{"text":"My mom and I decided to finally try this restaurant as it is only a block from our house. Thank goodness we finally did!  The food was amazing. My mom had the teriyaki bowl and she loved it. My bulgogi was ok, not too much flavor but still good. The Orange Blossom roll is a new favorite. The cucumber salad was so yummy!  One big plus is that this place finally converted me to miso soup. I've had it in other places, but this is the first place where it actually tasted good to me. My mom who likes miso soup agreed saying this is the best she's had. We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"This place was amazin! Had the Bei Special, Octopus Roll, Spicy Salmon, California, Spicy Crab. They were all very tasty but the Bei Special got me because each roll was topped with a different type of fish and each one was amazing! Had to have a dessert, ordered Green Tea Cheesecake, it was so delightful that I was tempted to order one to go"}
{"text":"So the food here is pretty good is not unreasonably priced, but when I dine in the service ruins it for me. Being friendly and fast is bare minimal, not saying their mean but customer service is definitely not their strong point for sure."}
{"text":"So excited for a new sushi restaurant in the neighborhood that got it right! Happy hour menu is awesome and the sushi is great. If you don't want to hassle with all the other sushi restaurants in old town with mediocre sushi and the typical singles crowd and want a laid back atmosphere with good food check this place out!"}
{"text":"Great sushi, great prices - the ambiance and service however was not the best. I would go back because I did enjoy the food, yet perhaps I just had a bad server."}
{"text":"We have been coming to Bei for awhile. The sushi is always fresh. We also like the sake selection. Plus the poke bowls are delicious."}
{"text":"Tried this place on a recommendation. From the parking lot this place did not look like a Japanese restaurant but a bar. I sat  down and the menu had many selections ranging from udon noodles to specialty rolls. I saw and ordered one of my favorite appetizers (hamachi kama) and the sashimi special which is the 12 piece chef's selection. 

The food came fairly fast especially the hamachi kama (the colar of a yellowtail fish), which usually comes after the dinner if prepared correctly. First glance, it looked very good but once I stuck my fork into it it was a bit overcooked, the meat was not flaky but a bit spongy and there were a few scales on the skin - Terrible!

Next came the sashimi and it looked good and was decent, thin slices of meat, the tuna was on the light side but decent. 

Overall I would not come back again."}
{"text":"Tried this place out last night for the first time during their happy hour and we liked it so much we came back again tonight! Yum"}
{"text":"Awesome happy hour restaurant! Delicious sushi, great atmosphere and friendly service. Try the yogurt flavored Soju tini or blueberry Soju for a drink!"}
{"text":"This place is amazing! Not only is the sushi phenomenal, but the service is great and very quick. Definitely recommend coming here."}
{"text":"I love this place. Pearl Sushi used to be our place to go, but this is much better. The rolls are amazing and the hot dishes are fantastic too. My husband got the spicy chicken dish and I couldn't stop eating it and now we crave it! Haven't tried anything bad yet. Go here. You wont regret it."}
{"text":"I went here, and had some miso soup. Mmm it was really good soup. Usually places don't make it so good."}
{"text":"The last time I came here, I was in a hurry and didn't wait for all my food to be delivered. The food was AMAZING! And it was this time too! I love the way it looks is super cute and modern! I come here all the time now and I wouldn't wanna get anywhere else!!"}
{"text":"if i could give them zero stars i would!!!!! i got takeout and went home and was eating my edamame and found a worm!!!! do not go here apparently this is not the first time this has happened!!! they are obviously doing nothing to solve this issue so beware and stay away from this restaurant!!"}
{"text":"I went to BEI ,last night great server Brittany,she was Friendly and on the Ball. Keep my drink cup full and the food was great. Had a good time. Seriously going to be Back for more. Thanks Brittany for knowing the Menu and being so sweet."}
{"text":"Wonderful sushi and sashimi, great service, and friendly staff. The garlic edamame and tuna sashimi is awesome."}
{"text":"First off, the service was fantastic! Very attentive and kind. For the price, the rolls were good. There could be more fish but for the price it's very fair and still high quality. The stuffed mushrooms were less mushroom and more crab but still very delicious. The price for a bottle of sake $7.95 can not be beat. Would definitely come again!"}
{"text":"My fist time here thanks to all the great Yelp reviews and you guys are the best!!! Great customer service and the food came out fast!!! Got the baked yellowtail collar appetizer and it opened up our palettes for their great sushi. Can't wait to come back again!"}
{"text":"We love Bei! Excellent happy hour specials, (the volcano roll is our favorite) and very good service!"}
{"text":"THIS PLACE IS OVERRATED! Okay, I'm a simple girl. I really just love GOOD basic sushi. A good California roll here, maybe some speciality rolls, nothing too much to ask but this place has not impressed me and I feel the the reviews just led me on. First, the California rolls weren't good. I want to know how one can possibly make a bad tasting cali roll? I spit it out immediately. The rice was so sticky!! They really were shy on the imitation crab as well because it just dropped out of the roll when I picked it up. Next, the egg rolls. What If I told you that the vegetable egg rolls at Panda Express were more tasty than these? Not bashing, just saying. They weren't even full egg rolls, they were cut into little slice things. Anyways, the house salad was good, it doesn't have that thicker ginger dressing that most sushi restaurants usually have but it's cool. I don't know if I'll be back but this place seems to have plenty of fans and I hope the business continues to be successful!"}
{"text":"Happy hour menu is for a long time and has good prices. And sushi is bomb. And add new things all the time"}
{"text":"Visited Bei for the first time yesterday and had a great dinner.  Overall the experience was great and I will be back, the sushi was good, and although we missed it the happy hour looked great.  The service was good we were greeted when we got there and sat at a nice table.  Miso soup gets a thumbs up, the salad (with that ginger dressing) gets a thumbs.  The sushi overall was good for what i expected from a strip mall sushi restaurant, and overall they beat my expectations prior to walking in.  The one item that caused the 4 vs 5 star review as the quality vs price of the sushi.  The prices were consistent with larger sushi restaurants but the quality was not equal.  Like I said we enjoyed it and will return but only during happy hour.  I don't mean to imply that the sushi was not good, I only mean it was not great.  They did get 4 vs 3 stars due to there very extensive happy hour menu much more then most sushi places.  Thanks again and we will see you soon."}
{"text":"Don't let the location fool you! This spot is awesome from the service to the food! We were in Phoenix for several days on business but made it into a leisure trip at the end. This was the 1st restaurant we went to after finding it here on Yelp. We're sushi snobs (from S.F.) so we were skeptical. But, for what it is, it's great. This is not high end sushi by any means but it's priced right and the venue is casual. We enjoyed our nigori sake with a chefs choice sashimi plate. All of the fish tasted fresh and was tender. We'd come again, for sure!"}
{"text":"Love the Golden Alaska roll, delish. Great atmosphere and everyone is friendly"}
{"text":"Wow. Like WOW! never, and I mean never! Go here. Unless you enjoy shitty service. I've never experienced worse service in my life. 

My friend and I got to the restaurant during happy hour around 8:50-9PM (keep in mind they're open until 11PM! So we were not the assholes that come in right before you close.). The manager sat us, and our server Carly came over after like 6-7 minutes of nothingness later.

When she approached our table, it was clear she had no interest in serving us (I can't fathom why not, considering we were the ONLY table). It took her like 10 minutes to bring us our drinks. Luckily our food came out shortly after in a timely manner. I ordered the sweet potato roll, and it was the last thing to come out. I don't know if you've ever had sweet potato before, but in general they're orange, so seeing that they were clear/translucent was too weird for me. I would have sent it back, but Carly decided talking to her coworkers and ignoring us, even after we were clearly finished, was a better idea! So when she finally came over, I told her she could take it back & that something about it wasn't right. She stood there questioning me like I was on trial about why it wasn't right/what I thought was wrong. If a customer complains, it doesn't matter what the problem was, just take care of it!! So she takes the roll back, while asking the chef behind the counter if he wants to try it to see what he thinks (which he did try it!). UHM WHAT, YOURE GOING TO EAT FOOD OFF OF A CUSTOMER'S PLATE?! I'm sorry, but that's a MAJOR health code violation!!!! She ended up sending the manager over after that, who then further questioned me, but comped it anyway. When we finally looked at the check, some of the dishes weren't correctly priced as they were on the happy hour menu. So my friend approached the counter where she waited.. And waited for Carly to come over so she could show her the receipt's error. When she decided to come help, she tried to argue with my friend over the happy hour menu, saying that \"well it changes every month.\" Well, excuse me, but it was on the menu, and my friend even showed her. She finally fixed it, and by the time she did, we had been waiting close to 10 additional minutes since the manager had been to our table. 

We spent about an hour and half at this restaurant. Unfortunately, I won't get that time or money back. Do NOT waste yours. Let this be a warning!"}
{"text":"Great Hawaiian roll and salmon teriyaki entree. I'll be back with family and friends."}
{"text":"I was visiting Phoenix with my girlfriend and she found this little Gem of a sushi restaurant. One shining feature for us was the Happy Hour that runs every day. We got the stuffed mushrooms which we're actually amazing! The rolls we're pretty good and were especially worth it for Happy Hour. We got the Spicy Tuna Roll ($5.50), Spicy Yellowtail Roll ($5.50), and Jalepeño Hamachi Roll (10.95). The first two rolls were tasty and a good deal. The Jalepeño definitely had a kick which was nice, but could have used a little more depth of flavor overall as a \"fancier\" roll. We also got the bottle of Shoes Chili Bai unfiltered Sake which was really refreshing and base decent deal at $7.95. I'm really glad to have made this stop part of our trip to Phoenix!"}
{"text":"my friends and i love it here! good music, prices, sushi, and miso soup! and $7 sake bombs. i love that you get a free miso soup if you check in. and the miso soup is so yummy! i recommend this place to my friends!"}
{"text":"Tried the happy hour on a Thursday and got there about 5:30.  The place was empty except for another couple that was already there.  

The place was nice and seemed cleaned.  As we were seated I realized how big the place was.  There is a alcohol bar near the front and the sushi bar near the rear.  

We ordered several rolls.  Actually ordered 2 too many as we had to take some leftovers to go.  The nigiri was good. We also liked the spicy tuna.  My wife liked the sweet potato roll which had no fish in it.  We liked the chili/garlic edamame and the aloe martini and recommend it."}
{"text":"We're now officially bona fide regulars here. We had previously been in love with Lao Thai (which was here before Bei was) and were pretty surprised to see it gone and replaced once upon a time. Whatever, we thought... may as well go in and try it out.

That was 3 months ago, and we have been back at least once every 2 weeks ever since. And every single time, it's got the best and freshest sushi on par with the quality you receive at ShinBay (without the wallet-breaking prices). 

On top of that, the happy hour specials are awesome, the bar is awesome, and the servers and personnel are awesome (especially Chase and Jun). 

Bei really quickly won us over and rest assured we will continue to come back here over and over. This place is great"}
{"text":"Husband and I came here on a Sunday afternoon - the jalapeño hamachi roll was our favorite, although the caterpillar roll was decent too. The service was a little slow for how not-busy it was, but not painfully so. Would definitely come back next time we're in the area"}
{"text":"GREAT,Fresh Sushi in this area.  Greater quality of sushi than Ra Sushi down the street.  The Uni is always consistent and fresh.  I stopped eating at Ra as I was served dry, old stinky Uni once.  Bei has exceptional Chirasi and they have Walu- something no one else in the area serves.  The wait staff and management are very inviting and friendly too. 
My only advice to the restaurant- improve drink menu, less watered down cocktails."}
{"text":"Expected better with all the positive reviews.  Rainbow roll was sub-par.  Lollipop was actually really good.  Just another strip mall sushi restaurant..."}
{"text":"Had been wanting to stop in to Bei for a while now. I own a restaurant up the road. Great happy hour here. Nigiri was really good quality. Service was friendly and efficient as well. They also have a lot of other options for noodles and more. I'd definitely recommend for a happy hour sushi spot!"}
{"text":"Bei was amazing the atmosphere is great and food is plentiful. The seaweed salad easily feeds 2 people and the rolls are bomb.com"}
{"text":"Bei sushi is by far one of my favorite restaurants in Old Town. From the customer service, food, and price this place is a hit. I have been to Bei five times and it never disappoints. I usually order the seared Albacore that taste phenomenal, as do their rolls. Highly recommend this place for dinner or lunch gatherings. My rating is based on the location, appearance, and food."}
{"text":"Very fresh fish! Amazing nigiri and happy hour. The poke bowl was a bit disappointing and I wouldn't recommend because the fish was not cubed and was more like a blended mush (not traditional poke). Overall, our experience was great!"}
{"text":"I hate to leave bad reviews but, we left a restaurant to come here.  Sashimi was ok.... But the owners carried fish in buckets through the front door right after we ordered.  Not from refrigerated delivery but from a car.... No ice or anything.  The fish is terrible quality and dangerous."}
{"text":"I have been here a few times and a friend and I had dinner there last night. We went during happy hour and the prices are great, probably the best you can find in the area! The rolls we had were good- tootsie, cali, and Vegas. We also had edamame, miso soup, and dumplings. Overall we were very pleased with the food! Our server was somewhat friendly but got short with us here and there. Not a huge deal, but it turned us off a bit and that's why I gave bei 4 out of 5 :)"}
{"text":"Great spot for sushi and my group had a ton of fun drinking saki as well. Enjoyed it from day one and I'll continue to go back."}
{"text":"We come here often on Friday nights -- great people, very good service, perfect drinks, happy hour menu has variety and changes, no complaints at all after many visits.   In addition, the place is divided up so that have three venues: a bar, a sushi bar, plus tables and booths.  Bathrooms are spotless."}
{"text":"Love this place! Great, clean food, service is consistently solid. Really nice and engaging owners/management and reasonable prices. Bigger than you would expect servings too!"}
{"text":"Gotta say every time I eat here i always enjoy myself. I never need to linger after i eat my food but i never feel rushed. I get the Spicy Crispy Chicken almost every time its delicious. Almost anything else you order from the sushi to the tempura is always satisfying. Don't even get me started on the service. Staff is super cool and knows the menu. Parkings easy and happy hour i 4:30-7 and 9-11. Awesome deals. Great food good price"}
{"text":"Fantastic little spot! Doesn't look like much from the outside, but what a gem! We went during happy hour and feasted on delicious rolls at very fair prices! Fresh fish, delicious combinations, wonderful service!"}
{"text":"Items I highly recommend - lollipop rolls and the stuffed bei mushrooms! We came right during happy hour, server was very attentive and brought all our orders on time. Wish there was a more extensive Japanese beer line up to choose from, however Kirin was good. Parking was a bit difficult, but the food was worth it! You have to visit this restaurant when you're in the Scottsdale area!"}
{"text":"Great tasting food. The chirasi bowl seems
Overpriced and has to compete with ahi poki. Only reason why one star off everything else seems great! Good service friendly staff."}
{"text":"I like a little more of an ambiance, but the food was good and the wait staff was very nice. I would recommend coming here if you want good sushi but don't care about the scene."}
{"text":"Bei blew me away with a spicy tuna bowl that is both fantastically good but a true deal as well. The bowl is huge and not full of just rice there is a substantial quantity of spicy tuna along with avacado and some radish. I love to get it for a togo meal especially at the $12 price. It's pretty filling all by itself and most of the time I can get away with just that.

I have branched out and tried a few other things as well including the squid salad (solid) and the spicy salmon salad (fish was good but didn't mesh well with the dressing). I have also had a few of the rolls here and they were good but I can't remember which they were.

I have been impressed with the quality of the fish here and the prices. A nice plus is the free miso soup when you check in on yelp."}
{"text":"Ordered for takeout based on reviews and I was not disappointed. I got the Spicy Crab and Nebraska Roll both were delicious. I am excited to try more items on the menu"}
{"text":"I was in the mood for sushi during lunch one day, but most of the sushi places in downtown Scottsdale are too loud/hip/fancy/expensive. I decided to try Bei, since it's in a modest strip mall and takes to-go orders. 

I called in and ordered the Golden Alaska and Vegetable rolls with a side of edamame to go, and was told it would only be 10-15 minutes, even though it was around noon during lunch rush hour. I got to the restaurant and everyone seemed very friendly. The waiter said he was including miso soup in my order as well, and by some miracle the total only came out to $12 -- I looked at the receipt and saw they gave me some sort of sushi combination lunch special price, even though I didn't order anything from that menu.

The sushi was awesome, and it was the best free miso soup I've had. Usually the soup at other restaurants is just salty broth, but this had a lot of tofu and seaweed and was something I would actually pay for with my order. I will definitely be going back for lunch."}
{"text":"Lived in the neighborhood for so long and never knew about it but once we tried it we had to go back. Has great service and amazing food!!"}
{"text":"This is a cool little place, that was nicely redone when it became B.E.I. 
The staff is very friendly, the food is fast and delish, happy hour is good but limited. 
The staff is very friendly and on top of things. We were greeted several times walking in the door and were waited on / bussed by a few different people, but knew who are true server was.  Our drinks were always full and we felt very welcomed. 
I have had several of the Sushi rolls, the yakisoba, spring rolls, tofu steak, edemame, and stuffed mushrooms. Everything has been great and all of it is recommended, especially the mushrooms. 
The presentation of food is nicely done and looks more expensive then it is. It is almost a great date place but it's almost too comfortable and well lit, it lacks romantic atmosphere, but would make a great casual date."}
{"text":"Parking lot is small so plan ahead! Interior wasn't what I expected at all. Quaint interior with booths and generic tables. 8 seat sushi bar but lots of tables inside. Plain inside, not fancy at all. I started with a quail egg shooter and it was so yummy. On the spicy side but good none the less. Food arrived quite quickly, beer nice and cold. We ordered many things off the menu, including the baked mussels. By far the best I've had in a while. Try the poke bowls too! Plentiful and delicious ! Happy hour was spectacular and highly recommended!"}
{"text":"I love this place! The only place I want sushi from. Nothing tastes the same anywhere else. Tikra is such a sweetheart. We'll be back soon. The place is a must go to."}
{"text":"Terrible service. The people sit you down then pay no attention to you. Nice spot however service needs improvement"}
{"text":"Excellent food every time I've been here. But service and kitchen expediting needs work. Many times have ordered apps that come out after entrees. Entrees have often come out at varied times (many minutes).  Little things like refills on tea.  They take glass but then don't bring a pitcher or a new glass and clear the old glassware.  Can't say enough  though about food; exceptional entrees and sushi."}
{"text":"I've had my fair share of sushi from an arrange of place, but Bei takes the win! Philly rolls are one of my favorite and theirs was so smokey & creamy! Our server was very nice, attentive, and makes one of the best margaritas I've ever had as well. I've never had a marg with sushi before. This was turning a new leaf for me, I can't wait to come back!"}
{"text":"Best sushi, best sashimi, best foods, best owner...best everything! Freshest seafoods u can find in town for sushi n sashimi!"}
{"text":"I have never been so satisfied after getting lost before in my life!! This place is an absolute gem! First of all we showed up right at closing, unbeknownst to us of course, and not a word was said. We were graciously and promptly sat with a smile and a warm greeting. Things only got better from there... Best sushi I think I've ever had. And Lim who must have been either the owner or manager was absolutely the most exceptional host I've ever had the pleasure of dining with. He even handled my crazy two year old with grace. I live over an hour away and can not wait to make the trip back!!! Thank you for such a wonderful meal!"}
{"text":"Best sushi and service in Old Town. So happy this place opened so close to us! We will be regulars for sure!"}
{"text":"Came here for the first time during happy hour with a friend the quality and price is incredible!!! So underrated 10/10 would recommend to a friend. Garlic edamame is a must."}
{"text":"I thought I had already found the best sushi in Scottsdale...I thought wrong! 
My boyfriend and I were seated right away. However, we were quickly forgotten...after 15 minutes we were able to flag down a waiter and get our drink and food orders in. Less than 15 minutes later, our order was brought out and it was absolutely delicious! The sushi was like fish candy to me (the way it should be). 
We got the California roll (happy hour priced, love that), shrimp tempura roll and calamari roll. When we got our check, our waiter had given us a discount because of our wait, which we appreciated. 
I'll be bringing my family here in the near future!"}
{"text":"BEST SUSHI IN ALL OF PHOENIX/SCOTTSDALE!!!!!!

Tried many places all over the area, none top this. Service was amazing, sushi was amazing and came out so quickly! I can't believe it's taken 5 years for is to find this place. Will definitely be back soon!"}
{"text":"Big Fan - Great prices and The Best Sushi in Scottsdale Bar None."}
{"text":"Went here for the first time tonight after hearing great reviews. We got the spicy tuna, California roll, octopus roll and shrimp tempura as well as miso soup and sake bombs. Everything was fantastic! The service was great and atmosphere was fun. We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"We are huge sushi and Japanese food lovers from California so we were a little nervous to try sushi during a recent trip to Scottsdale. We need not have worried. The sushi and the hot entrees were absolutely delicious! We were greeted by a smiling, friendly host and our waitress was kind, friendly and extremely fast and efficient. Best of all, the food was excellent. My husband's sushi was fresh and delicious, while my son's yakitori and tempura were also wonderful. I ordered the chicken terriyaki bowl and loved the sauce as well as all the fresh veggies that accompanied it. Overall we were very impressed and would go back the next time we are in Scottsdale - it has made it onto our favorites list for sure!"}
{"text":"chill vibes, really good service, and the food was great. Definitely recommend the volcano roll."}
{"text":"We were looking for a new place to try sushi and stumbled upon Bei on yelp. Love the service here, the staff was super friendly and attentive. Very cute place to grab some delicious sushi! New favorite sushi spot. I would definitely try it out if you live in the area!"}
{"text":"Love going for happy hour. Fast and friendly service. The sushi is amazing. Love the vegetable tempura and the miso soup!"}
{"text":"Decided to try Bei for lunch during the work week since my co-worker was craving noodles so I suggested we go to Bei since she hadn't been yet and it wasn't far from work. 

The place wasn't busy (maybe 5 tables of people sitting) and once we sat we looked at the lunch specials. My girlfriend had the 1 Noodle and 1 Rice bowl special. I had the Mixed Tempura Box.

Ok we were SHOCKED at how much food came out for that price!!!! Mine came with a salad, CA roll (4 pc), mixed tempura w/veggies and shrimp, and rice and it was huge! I didn't even touch the rice, CA roll or finish all the veggies and I am stuffed. 

Her's came out and the Udon noodles bowl was HUGE (dinner size portion) with veggie tempura AND a rice pork bowl (dinner size portion). We were so full by the time we left.

Here's was $12.95 and mine was $7.95. You cannont beat that. Someone could easily split one dish for two people.

Service was also great like always."}
{"text":"Great service, great food, and a fun atmosphere. Watched the Sunday night football game here. The happy hour is awesome here too! I'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"Best sushi in the valley! Awesome rolls, drinks, & apps. Come for happy hour for the best deals. It's always fresh & delicious."}
{"text":"Love it!!! We heard about this place from a friend and I knew we had to try it out. We loved everything and our waitress, Kazu, was the best!!! Will def be a favorite for a long time."}
{"text":"I thought it was pretty good. Make sure you call in your order because when I tried doing it online, I was being charged almost $50 versus over the phone, it was $27. I think I got their lunch combos that didn't show up in their online order system. 
I ordered the Golden Alaska roll and Tootsie Roll both for $11 (or maybe it was $13). Also ordered a chicken teriyaki and chicken yakisoba for $13 (our maybe this one was $11)... GREAT value and taste. I was very pleasantly surprised. 
I'm definitely coming back."}
{"text":"Bei has always been my favorite sushi place after moving to Arizona. They have the best happy hour prices and amazing sauces to go with the sushi."}
{"text":"our neighbors use to run Lao Thai, the restaurant that use to be here. they had one of the best asian fish dishes in the valley. Now this new place, BEI is here and i'm thinking \"when did this happen\"? 

i was VERY skeptical at first, especially when i saw so many yelp reviews with 5 stars, most from people with 1 friend/1 review or 66 friends/0 reviews. i appreciate elite reviewers for the most part and there weren't many. 

anyway, it was late and we didn't want a sit down dinner so i stopped by for a takeout order. the place was quite full on the wednesday before thanksgiving. the staff greeted me with open arms...very friendly. i was given a full menu and a sushi menu. the sushi menu is large and even has sashimi. i ordered a salmon and tuna sashimi. i thought both were very good...nice big cuts, fresh, and very smooth on the palate. 

also ordered a seafood udon soup dish. although the portion was large and overflowing with those delicious noodles, they were WAY skimpy on the seafood. one mussel, 2 shrimp, and about 5 baby scallops. for 10 bucks, i expected a bit more seafood because i know udon noodles are cheap. this brought the stars to 3 unfortunately.

the rest of their menu looked good and apparently they have a great happy hour. when we go for a sit down and try something else, maybe i too will be on of the multiple 5 star reviewers."}
{"text":"Been here a few times. Every time the sushi has been fresh and delicious. Happy hour prices are pretty good too. Would recommend this spot to anybody looking for some good quality sushi in the Scottsdale area."}
{"text":"I've been waiting to write Bei a review!!!

Bei is one of my favorite Sushi spots in Scottsdale. It's not right in old town which eliminates insane wait times but is equally as delicious if not better. They have a great happy hour and a HUGE menu. From speciality rolls to noodle dishes and fried rice, you aren't limited to eating sushi if you are craving some other type of Asian dish. We love the Las Vegas Roll, Nebraska roll and the Spicy Chicken Noodle Dish.

The staff is typically super great, quick and happy to have you as a customer. I agree with the other reviews, the actual restaurant isn't fancy and it's located in a plaza on Scottsdale Rd. but you absolutely wont' regret visiting!"}
{"text":"I come here pretty often (mainly because my friend loves it), but also because the happy hour prices are very fair. It really has been hit or miss for me. The garlic edamame is delicious. The gyoza lacks flavor unless doused in the sauce it comes with. I LOVE the crunchy calamari roll, which I always add cream cheese to. It is always tasty and well cooked. Last time I was there I ordered both the spicy salmon and the spicy tuna rolls for HH. The spicy tuna didn't taste very fresh, but was well flavored otherwise. The spicy salmon was basically flavorless. It tasted like I was eating cold rice and mush. I wouldn't recommend that roll, but maybe it was a bad day for the salmon. Service is also a hit or miss. There are times I have come in and been served everything in a timely manner, but other times, I am waiting 15+ minutes for the check when all of the food on the table is gone. All in all, it is good for the price and I would recommend coming here for happy hour. Otherwise, pay a little more somewhere else for fresher sushi."}
{"text":"Spicy crispy chicken more like spicy crispy FLAMEEEE!!!!! Yummmmm. Best Asian cuisine west of the Mississippi. Big portions happy belly."}
{"text":"I absolutely love sushi places
So when I saw this one pop up
I was anxious to try it
After seeing the near perfect yelp reviews
I was super excited and was anxious to see what I would think of it
We went on a Friday evening and it wasn't very busy so it was good
Upon arrival the staff was super friendly
Greeting us as we walked in 
We were given a booth table to sit at and our server welcomed us
We were given water and two great menus
They have a ton of options for food and drinks
It was happy hour when we got there and we notice that the items were super cheap, so of course we hit that up
We got 
Two miso soup bowls
The fried Calamari 
One California roll
One tootsie roll
One shrimp tempura

The soup was nice and warm; it also had a lot of flavor
The calamari was the best that I had ever had... Usually restaurants give you little fried rings and stuff but BEI gives you big long 3-4 inch pieces that are really, really good
The sauce that comes with the calamari is great as well
Both of the sushi rolls were very yummy and very fresh
The rice on both rolls were sticky and the ingredients were good
The shrimp tempura was really good too

Our server was very attentive and knowledgable of the menu

This isn't much of a bad opinion/con but the inside of Bei is kind of drab and could use some better interior decorations
This didn't bug me at all since I know that it is a new place and I am sure once they get a bigger clientele and revenue that they will add some nice touches 
Just a hint that don't let the interior fool you, the food is great and the service is great

I will be back BEI"}
{"text":"We've been here twice and both times were extremely happy with the experience. 

Our first visit was actually on Christmas day. We don't really celebrate and wanted something non-traditional that wasn't going to be ridiculously expensive. When we saw on Facebook that this place was going to be open, we made sure to head on over. 

We got calamari and garlic, chili edamame to start. The edamame was amazing! By far the best I've had at a sushi joint. The calamari was ok. I liked that they used steaks instead of rings, but I really wasn't a fan of the batter. I would have preferred a tempura style, rather than the harsher, breadcrumb coating. I think it took away from the good piece of squid hiding underneath. But it was still good, and if you like calamari you'll like this.

For rolls we got the Blazing Alaska Roll, the Vegas Roll and the Golden Philly Roll. All three were so incredibly good! The sashimi used was fresh and flavourful, and the wasabi aioli wasn't overpowering, which was my fear. I'd highly recommend any of the rolls we got.

The second time we were there we went for lunch and got the roll combo (each of us). Two rolls and miso for $8.95 is a great deal! I know I got the spicy yellowtail with avocado instead of cucumber and eel and avocado. I don't remember what my partner got, but it was gone pretty quick, so it must have been good! Mine were great. I'm a huge fan of spicy yellow tail, especially if it's fresh. 

I'd definitely recommend going during happy hour or lunch, but their prices aren't ridiculous so you won't break the bank during dinner. We'll definitely be back! There are a bunch more rolls that we want to try. We're hoping that they're open on Christmas again next year. (hint hint!)"}
{"text":"Happy hour all day Tuesdays! Great quality food and great price, will keep coming back:)"}
{"text":"Everything was tasty here and the people were so nice.  I had the lunch bento box.  The spicy pork was delicious as was the tempura.  It was all very good but I wouldn't say it was special.  Still, if you're in the mood for solid Japanese food, this is a good spot."}
{"text":"Sushi is good and the happy hour menu is great. This is a good place to go during happy hour. Good neighborhood eatery."}
{"text":"Wow!!! I am so glad I found this place.  Live music, cold beers, fantastic sushi and amazing desserts!!  This is hands down the best sushi and Asian restaurant in town!!!!"}
{"text":"The service is great.  Helpful and expedient wait staff.  Water is always filled and they take the time to answer any question you may have about the restaurant.

The best thing here is the sushi.  The seafood is fresh and portions large.  They have a wide assortment of different types of sushi to fulfill your every desires. Hope they start expanding to more exotic types of seafood.  

 I've tried some of their other dishes like the noodles .  It's okay, but you would be better off going to a noodle shop.  Likewise on some of their other entrees which are good, but nothing special."}
{"text":"Awesome sushi!great warm sake an awesome atmosphere :) they always play good music haha."}
{"text":"Bei is a cute little Asian fusion spot on the border of Scottsdale and Tempe.  They serve up everything from sushi, Korean bulgogi, ramen, and other noodle plates.

I came here on a Friday night and the place was popping.  We had to wait couple of minutes for my seat with some of my mates which is fine.  The place itself is decked out pretty hip and fun.  

We ordered some food off the happy hour to start; edamame, Spicy Tuna, Volcano, and California.  Needless to say it wasn't anything special to start with.  Then again it was just starters, but in the end we didn't think it was something we couldn't get anywhere else.  We moved on with some entrees.  My mate ordered the Sashimi platter while I shot for the Goshujang Pork; a spicy marinated pork dish with white rice as a side.  It did come along with some tempura vegetables and a miso soup.  In the end, it was a lot of bang for your bucks I tell ya!  The entree definitely needed some texture since it was a mesh of tender pork, onions, and some scallions on a sizzling hot plate as a came straight out of the kitchen!

Overall, the food here is pretty good, but again nothing too special.  The place seems pretty cool for a quick happy hour bite and drink.  The service was pretty slow in my opinion since we had to wait for our edamame twice! - Enjoy!"}
{"text":"I was on the fence between 2-3 stars after my first visit, but the second definitely confirmed the 2star. Service was good, ambiance is casual, but food is very mediocre. There is plenty of parking in the lot outside, and there is happy hour daily. 

Nigiri and sashimi:
Uni nigiri was good, amaebi disappointing, sake nigiri mediocre, and sake sashimi good. Rice on the nigiris were a bit too densely packed, and the fish on top was sliced thinly and then pressed too forcefully into the rice.

Happy hour rolls:
Very, very mediocre. I guess the happy hour price might seem like it's worth it, but I probably wouldn't order from the happy hour menu again. I had a Baked Alaska roll, which was room temperature and comprised of some tasteless fish with tempura powder sprinkled on top. The Golden Alaska was similar except the entire roll was fried on the outside.. and I could taste the staleness of the oil. The batter was deathly thick, and when I bit into a piece, I could feel my mouth coated with oil. My friends also ordered some rolls from the happy hour menu, which were equally unimpressive.

Teriyaki chicken:
There was a lot of food in this entree, but it came out on a hot plate looking like a soppy mess. There were a ton of sliced vegetables, some sliced meat, and a pool of (questionable teriyaki) sauce. It also came with tempura, which was good.

Non-happy hour rolls:
The first time I was here, I tried the Dragon and Caterpillar Rolls. Dragon was unmemorable with sparse unagi on top, and the Caterpillar was decently good but with mushy avocado on top. I liked the Scottsdale Roll, which had fresh fish and a good kick on the inside.

As a random tidbit, the miso soup here is surprisingly good. Unfortunately it's not good enough to redeem the other disappointing dishes."}
{"text":"Favorite low key sushi place in Scottsdale. Never had a bad experience. Get the teriyaki salmon entree. Once you get that you have trouble ordering anything else."}
{"text":"This was my first time trying this restaurant. Owner and staff were very friendly and welcoming. Food was excellent! For starters we ordered seasoned edamame and fried dumplings, followed by volcano rolls, spicy salmon rolls, a teriyaki chicken bowl and a set of vegetarian rolls. Everything was delectable. My personal favorite - volcano rolls!

Will definitely come back for more!"}
{"text":"I would give this restaurant four stars for the food, but the presentation was a bit on the \"plain/nonexistent\" side.  And especially with Japanese food, it's all about the presentation.

Met my son here for lunch.   We both decided on the sushi combo with the spicy tuna roll.    The fish seemed fresh.   And the sushi was good, but it was the presentation.  (see photo)  I think it needs a little more color and garnish versus the lonely lemon wedge.   What do you think?

Plus, it didn't help that the workpeople were remodeling the bathrooms while we were there.   There was teeth chattering drilling going on.   Somehow, it didn't make for a peaceful lunch.   More like nerve wracking if you ask me.   I would think it would be a good idea to at least do it in the morning or afternoon when it is not so busy/empty versus during prime time dining.  I dunno.  Just my thought.   

The server was pleasant and professional.   I dunno.   Might need to look for a different place to meet my son for lunch."}
{"text":"I came back and had the ramen. It was seriously bad. I thought there was bad ramen from Republic Ramen but this takes the trophy. Noodles were technically store packaged noodles and it became soggy in minutes. I know delicious ramen noodles and yeah... Broth didn't impress either.

You can come here for other food but don't get the ramen. EVER."}
{"text":"Love this place! Chang is the best! Seriously, quit surfing for other sushi reviews mid-Scottsdale. If you go there ask for Chang, I ordered once and came back like a month later and he asked me if i wanted the exact same thing and quotes my order. Amazing service!"}
{"text":"First time here, and I am impressed!!! Gabe is the best waiter ever and hooked it up. 10/10 so amazing, completely unique, unlike any other, talented, brilliant, extraordinary, not afraid to reference, will definitely come here again. Amazing happy hour with great prices!!! Bei is the bæ"}
{"text":"I was here for happy hour recently and was impressed.  It's a bright modern look with plenty of windows and TVs all around.

The happy hour prices were very good.  I enjoyed the gyoza, Las Veags roll and Volcano roll in particular.

I'd definitely come back again."}
{"text":"We were greeted as soon as we walked in the door. Quickly seated and served water and menus. I like how they decorated the restaurant. Much better than the previous Thai restaurant that was here before. I ordered the Calamari appetizer. I believe the best Calamari appetizer I have ever tasted. Loved the crisp panko coating. I also had the Tootsie Roll. Very good and filling. My friend ordered the lunch special Mixed Tempura Box. Boy, did it look yummy! It must have been because he ate every bite. The Bento Box had so much food for only $7.95. The only thing I was disappointed in was the Seafood Dynamite. It did not taste fresh.  It had a strong \"imitation\" flavor to it. Besides that, it was very difficult to eat with chopsticks. I thought I was going to get something similar to RA's Scallop Dynamite. Very different. I do not recommend this appetizer at all. The experience was nice. Staff eager to please. Food delicious. Restaurant clean. I will come back."}
{"text":"Delish food and great hh hours and prices. Will definitely go again!! Edamame with garlic has a lot of garlic. Sushi has nice pieces of fish."}
{"text":"Best happy hour in town, sushi game proper ! Ask about the free Mochi. Saki bombs will be sent !"}
{"text":"It's lit fam and our waitress was dope. The sweet potato and avocado rolls are also fire."}
{"text":"The best sushi place I have found in the Tempe/South Scottsdale area. The sushi was delicious and the happy hour/lunch prices were super reasonable! The service was friendly and timely."}
{"text":"UPDATE: I absolutely LOVE this place and have to admit I feel a little down writing about the last 2 experiences I've had, considering how I've become a die-hard regular. In hopes that you will not go through the same experience, I am writing this more as a warning. My boyfriend and I walked in there on a Saturday evening, we were greeted right away, as usual, by the kind Asian man, who we believe is the owner. We sat at  our usual high-top table, and waited...waited... waited for about 7 minutes (very unusual) for our server to greet us and bring us menus. When we came over, we immediately realized it was the same waiter we had the last time we had a negative experience. With no enthusiasm he brought us menus and left. Didn't offer us a drink until the second time he came around. After he brought us our drinks he went about his runs, and forgot about us. Finally, he came back to our table and ASSUMED we wanted the sashimi combo and was about to run to put it in when we quickly told him we were trying new things. We put in an appetizer (Salmon Kama), and 4 other rolls. Everyone else brought us our food instead of our waiter. What ENRAGED me is that I saw him SMOKING OUT OF AN E-CIGARETTE PEN BY THE BAR!!!! Also, we NEVER got our appetizer. Apparently, the waiter never put it in seeing that the Asian man had to ask us what we ordered. When the Salmon Kama came out, it was DISGUSTING. My boyfriend said it tasted as if they microwaved leftover fish and put it on a plate with cabbage. I have to agree. Only the times we've gotten this server (whom I don't even know his name, Hispanic looking man, with lots of arm tattoos and spiky hair) have been the times we have had bad service, his tip showed how unsatisfied we were, I even wrote him a little comment. Hopefully this will make him fix his style of waitoring to prevent driving customers away.  Aside those incidents, the place is still AMAZING.



what separates BEI from the surrounding sushi restaurants is their fish. I am always searching for good-tasting sushi spots where you can actually distinguish the fish by taste not just by sight. their fish is excellent, and tastes super fresh. comparable to several upscale sushi restaurants in Miami. 

simply because of taste, I would choose this place over any of the chains in the Scottsdale area. their customer service is also impressive. everyone, including the owner, are extremely attentive and welcome you enthusiastically. they make sure to ask how your food tasted, and are open for suggestions. you can tell they're in the business because they love Japanese food and the art of sushi, not just to make money and turn it into a chain. 

the only thing \"fishy\" (no pun intended) is the area. its located in a shopping strip in south Scottsdale that looks a bit shady during the day, a reason why it took me a little longer to try the place out. I was a bit skeptical.

inside is a different story. its very clean, well-maintained and you can tell they put in some work to remodel the place.

their specials are amazing as well! they have a few of their specialty rolls as part of their specials and their portions are never skimped. you need to try the BLAZING ALASKA ROLL its definitely my favorite roll on their happy hour menu.

if you're a sushi enthusiast, you MUST try this place. I guarantee it becomes one of your favorites"}
{"text":"A++! Second time here and both times have been awesome! Very accommodating and friendly staff, excellent service, fantastic interiors, and awesome food!"}
{"text":"We are never disappointed at Bei, amazing food and great prices. Love their happy hour menu, they have excellent prices. This time we devour the gyoza and miso soup for appetizer. And ordered 3 sushi rolls: Lobster Tempura roll, Golden Alaska Roll and Las Vegas roll. Everything we have tried is deliciously amazing. We highly recommend it!!"}
{"text":"Love coming here! Great happy hour prices and amazing service and staff!! 

I recommend the sunshine roll! It's amazing!"}
{"text":"I like the sushi here but I don't think it's fantastic.  I love the pearl filtered sake, and the service is usually great.  They are always falling over themselves to help you out.  Sometimes the service can border on the bizarre though.  I've never had them try to rush us out but sometimes the waiter can just be.... awkward.  Also, the interior is just ugly.  The booths and the bathroom scream diner, which is just not the type of interior I'm looking for when I'm eating sushi."}
{"text":"This has been my third visit to Bei, and 2 out of the three times I have been extremely happy. I love how the menu has udon noodles and some other dishes I have not found at other sushi restaurants, and the sushi is pretty good. Also, any place that has happy hour until 7 is awesome, however an advertised $7 per sake bomb is nothing to get excited about."}
{"text":"Pretty good sushi and Hawaiian bowl for lunch. Service is great but parking can be limited."}
{"text":"As usual, BEI crushes it again. Everything we had was delicious. Happy Hour deals are great, and our table is stuffed."}
{"text":"Amazing service. Cody was an amazing server. Definitely recommend getting the Bei Saki Bomb paired with the Jalapeño Hamachi Roll  10/10 defiantly recommend!!"}
{"text":"Great bento box! Our office loves going there for lunch. The decor isnt the best, but worth a visit."}
{"text":"I love coming here, always have the best sushi at a really reasonable price. The bento boxes for lunch are my #1 favorite"}
{"text":"Stopped by for a light meal. Great ambivalence and friendly staff. Our server Ella is professional, was able to accommodate us very well, and she is a sweetheart :) Jalapeno poppers are a must and food was overall delicious, and made fresh. Portion sizes meet the price, and the quality of food is fairly decent. I was having a bad day like i woke up on the wrong side of the bed or something, but the good food just made my day."}
{"text":"We love BEI! We come in late nights sometimes 2-3 nights a week! Everything is super fresh the gyozas satisfy my random prego cravings! Can't say enough good things about this place"}
{"text":"Huge cuts of sashimi, good service and some the higher quality fish I've had regardless of price. I would return here in a heartbeat."}
{"text":"Decent overall. Super friendly and attentive service. Ramen was just okay...broth not very flavorful so I asked for a side of Sriracha to give it a flavor boost. Sushi was decent too. Nice environment and convenient."}
{"text":"Very tasty Japanese food for Arizona.  The miso soup was too salty, but the Tuna Lover roll and Yakitori were good.  Don't make the mistake of coming during peak hours.  The Happy Hour is such a good deal you will be kicking yourself for not coming in earlier or waiting a little bit longer to eat and drink."}
{"text":"Ok this is my fourth time here and it was the worst!!! Sushi was amazing first off but then I decided too order the stuffed mushroom on the happy hour which I could only eat one bite of. It was too sweet and every part of it had the sweetest teriyaki sauce I have ever put in my mouth! It was like eating a desert!!
   I asked for the bill and told the waiter I couldn't eat it because it was so sweet and that they should put that in their menu.  He just said sorry and then the sushi chefs kept saying sorry, but hey it wasn't there fault!!   When the waiter came back with the check and i told him I would have never ordered that knowing it was the sweet and I hate wasting food he stated \"that he could have the manger come. \"I waited forFew minutes looking around on my phone but manager never came.  I tipped the sushi chefs and the waiter but I will truly never eat There again!!! Worst thing I have ever put in my mouth and that says a lot!!!   So sweet it should be a desert!"}
{"text":"Amazing food and prices !!! I ordered the spicy salmon salad and the cardinal roll and my friend ordered the vegas roll. The cardinal roll was different and had grilled onions on top that added a twist to it. The salmon salad was amazing and my favorite salad."}
{"text":"Ok. Not bad. Nothing exciting. The rolls are very small and basic. The chiefs hi bowl was decent with a good amount of rice. 

Satisfied my craving for sushi in general but won't be craving this place specifically."}
{"text":"We come here all the time! Great happy hours and the best stuffed mushrooms. We love eating and drinking here!"}
{"text":"Who would've guessed that the name of this restaurant, Bei (?), can be translated as \"America\" or \"rice\"? As it turns out, this is quite fitting since they serve very Americanized sushi rolls.

If you're looking for gourmet specialty sushi rolls with high-end ingredients, Bei is not for you. However, if you want really awesome happy hour prices and don't mind imitation crab and you're a big fan of California rolls, then Bei has you covered! 

We tried the Alaska Roll ($6.50) made with fresh salmon, crab mix, and avocado; the Volcano Roll ($9.95) which is a California Roll topped with a baked fish, crab mix, spicy alioli, eel sauce, and scallions; and the Philly Roll ($6.5) made with fresh salmon, cream cheese, and avocado. 

The rolls that we sampled were good, but as another reviewer mentioned, the California roll is over-represented on the menu as a base for the majority of the rolls. This is a shame because the the true freshness and deliciousness of the tuna and salmon were overpowered by the imitation crab mix. Next time, I will stick to the sashimi and specialty sashimi entrees because I think that is where Bei really shines when it comes to their sushi offerings. 

I look forward to returning to try the Korean BBQ, Ramen Noodles, and Noodle combos. Also, I appreciate that Bei offers some more interesting sushi options for vegetarians as well. I've never seen a sweet potato roll on a sushi menu before, but it sounds delicious!"}
{"text":"We love this little neighborhood spot! Great happy hour specials and sushi! Ramen is also delicious!"}
{"text":"Fantastic sushi. Fresh fish and great service. Came here for an anniversary and was not disappointed. Staff was courteous. Food came out fast. We will definitely come back later."}
{"text":"I do love this place because of their awesome happy hour deals until 7 pm every day! The sushi is good and very affordable on happy hour. That being said, there is still a lot to be desired aside from sushi. I have never been impressed with the entrees there. I just had the chicken yakisoba bowl (to go) and it was so bland that we had to add our own sauce. So stick to the sushi menu!

There is not much to see on the outside or inside of this place. Drink fountain could be updated as well-- the water they serve always has a weird taste. Decor could use some serious updating. BUT again decently priced and delicious sushi on happy hour!"}
{"text":"My hubby and I moved back to the East Valley after a two year stint in the northwest valley where we were totally obsessed with Yen Sushi at 43rd Ave and Bell.  We have been searching for a place to fill Yen's shoes ever since we moved back.  We have found our new go-to sushi place.  Thank you Bei! 

 The cucumber salad was vinegar-y and delicious and the free check-in miso soup was nicely salty sprinkled with the crunch of scallions.  
We ordered the Bei roll which was such a pleasant surprise.  Every piece of roll was a new adventure because they all have different fish toppings.  They have a lot of selections for happy hour rolls as well as drinks .  One suggestion: add Sapporo to the happy hour beer selections.  Why Kirin and not Sapporo?"}
{"text":"We came here on New Years Eve and enjoyed the large sashimi between two people.  It was very good and fresh.  The portions were standard for most Japanese restaurants.  We also had the miso, cucumber salad and edamame with Chile.  The Chile added a nice flavor to it.  All food was delicious.  We always top our Japanese dinners off with an order of unagi for desert.  They didn't disappoint."}
{"text":"Waitress doesn't speak English well enough to respond to questions. Promised my daughter tempura chicken. The waitress brought out some thing else all together and my husband and I were almost done eating. My daughter just sat there and cried. Then the manager explained that tempura chicken came on another menu. Oh good to know, now that my daughter is hungry and crying at the end of the meal. Totally :/ willing to accommodate."}
{"text":"While visiting the greater Phoenix area for a work trip, we decided to see what all the hype was about at the Bei sushi bar in Scottsdale. Chalk one up for the away team for a great choice! 

First of all, the atmosphere was super cool. You know how a lot of sushi places are like super quiet (almost library quiet)? Well, think cool sports bar, meets hip sushi restaurant, meets fun weeknight hangout with friends, and that would sum it up. There were lots of tv's to watch sports, nice bar area and a comfortable dining area. Service was very friendly and quick, and the sushi cooks were as fast as ninjas!

Now, let's get to the best part: the sushi. We had the Vegas roll, Crazy Alaska roll, Tuna Lover and one other which I can't remember the name. All the fish was very fresh and bursting with flavor. Usually when I go for sushi, I get a bit tired of at least one of the rolls that I order. Tonight was an exception to that. The last bite was just as delicious as the first, and we even considered ordering a few rolls to-go. Overall, this was a solid experience and I would definitely return. Thanks Bei!"}
{"text":"Okay, I really like this place! It is about a mile away from my house, friendly service, and the food is great. Their happy hour can't be beat!

My only gripe: I called in a take-out order last night and was told that orders were taking longer than usual and it would be a half hour. \"No problem!\" I said. I showed up almost exactly 30 minutes later, and I waited for at least another 20-30 minutes in the restaurant. I totally understand that it's a Friday night and things are busier than usual, but if that's the case week after week, plan for it! Hire a few more sushi chefs on the weekends to not keep so many people waiting. There were 4 other customers waiting for their to-go orders along with me. It was a bummer!

Despite the long wait, I will go back (but dine in)."}
{"text":"Not many sushi restaurants have a roll with tuna tataki on a spicy tuna roll. The prices are impressive compared to other sushi spots of the same quality."}
{"text":"Came back for lunch with some coworkers.  Food was good (I had the beef teriyaki bento box) but service was AWFUL.  The waiter came to our table and awkwardly stood behind one of my friends.  She turned around to let him know we were ready to order and his response \"i know, that's why I'm standing here\".  At the end he just dropped all our checks on the table instead of handing each check to us.  Also someone asked him to break a $5 and he said no.

I've been here twice before and never had a problem with service.  It was a disappointing experience as I do like the food."}
{"text":"Been craving sushi all week and after a 9 hour day on my feet I needed it. I've seen this place before and we finally took the plunge!! So worth it! We were seated right away and had great customer service. The tuna lovers roll is the shiz and I would come back just for that! Happy hour options are also bomb dot com."}
{"text":"I decided to head down here since I was in the area and I had a sushi craving at 9pm. The place was not hard to find and there was plenty of parking. We walk in and it was not what I expected - picture a bar type atmosphere, dark, and not very classy - but it's cool, I wasn't looking for a five star restaurant anyway. There were two big groups of people seated at the bar loud as hell - maybe they were drunk or maybe they were just happy since it was a Saturday night, but I didn't mind much.

The restaurant had a late night happy hour. We ordered the shrimp dynamite roll and Nebraska roll. Both were good, but the rolls tasted pretty similar to each other. The check came to $25. The service was quick, easy and painless."}
{"text":"I think it's awesome that they have 2 happy hours, one until 7pm one 9-11pm. We had mixed tempura with shrimp and lots of veggies. Thought that we needed a thicker dipping sauce. The spicy tuna was failry standard. Vegas golden philliy volcano unsettling. Edamame quite salty."}
{"text":"Quick service, good food, great price and friendly staff. Always plenty of seating - a great place for work lunch groups."}
{"text":"Our first time at BEi last nite and it was a great experience. The decor is nothing special but the sushi is tremendous and the servers are great. We ate at the bar. June, the owner, attended to us an we felt very welcome. Unlike lots of sushi places, BEi doesn't offer just undersized rolls but gives you the regular fare and the prices are great! We'll go back tonight!"}
{"text":"Bei is bar far the best sushi restaurant in Phoenix and has awesome happy hour prices! Manager Cody is always welcoming along with the staff. Kelsi and Melissa are always wonderful, I highly suggest checking this place out  :)"}
{"text":"Mediocre Sushi/Japanese Restaurant

Meh.

We ordered dirty martinis to start, which came with old mushy olives. The martini itself was okay! Although, once the first thing you order doesn't taste fresh, your skepticism is turned on HIGH. For apps, we ordered the miso (free with Yelp check in) - which was simply put, good. But to be honest... I've never ever had BAD miso. The gyoza was plain and pretty flavorless and the sauce didn't help at all. I tried soaking it in wasabi soy sauce, which was just another fail. 

The citrus tataki didn't taste as fresh as it looked, but was alright. I wasn't a huge fan of the thin slices or the fact it didn't somehow to taste citrusy at all. The Las Vegas roll was okay, no complaints. 

The one thing I do commend was our server! In dark times, she was a star! She was attentive and quick. She quickly brought out our orders and noticed once the other server didn't bring our dishes out together and fixed the issue. She also gave us free a free Mochi for spending over $60! (I did enjoy the mochi and whipped cream) Thanks Mellisa for being our favorite part of this whole place ... shine bright, shine far, you're a star!!! (the one star)"}
{"text":"Great happy hour, sushi, poke bowls, drinks, and apps. Live music on Thursdays and plenty of room for a big group. The gyoza is awesome along with the sunset roll"}
{"text":"Tried Bei tonight for the first time with the hubby and it was super yummy! To quote our dinner conversation- \"I think we've found a gem!\" Happy hour every day, with specials on drinks, apps and rolls. Nice presentation for the food, large portions- enough to take home a doggy bag, and good prices. Will be back! :)"}
{"text":"As somewhat of a sushi connoisseur, I found this place entirely average. The sushi was really good (as is most sushi), but nothing about this place set it aside from any other sushi restaurant. Granted, I was not there on a night when they had live music, so I feel like that would make the environment more fun. Otherwise, 7/10 would recommend."}
{"text":"3rd time here and food is fresh and service from Ella the best...had goyza and egg rolls...California roll and jalapeno roll...all 5 stars"}
{"text":"The portions here were great. Appetizers were prepared well and came out in a timely manner prior to the main course. 

The atmosphere of the restaurant was inviting and well kept. Music was not loud or distracting and the pricing was fair - even for Scottsdale. 

The only thing i was disappointed with was the Mochi selection. Strawberry was pictured but not available. 

Solid establishment. Would come again."}
{"text":"Great ramen, good sushi :)  Good bar area and service. Plenty of parking."}
{"text":"Great! Gyoza and the Nebraska roll were great. Happy hour prices are reasonable. 10/10 would recommend"}
{"text":"This was delicious! The salmon melted in my mouth and the overall quality of the food was very good. Pricing was also good, and affordable. 

I am new to the area and will likely be coming back.
The service our waitress Ella provided was exceptional.

P.S. I would like to add that I am Brian F.'s BAE and concur with everything that he has stated in his review."}
{"text":"Omg this place is SO good and affordable! We seriously loved the sushi and we got a free dessert our waitress was seriously the nicest! All the food we ordered was super good. Our total was only 27 dollars!! We both were so full. My son is 18 months and seriously ate the egg rolls so fast!"}
{"text":"Ok, I'll be the first to say I was underwhelmed by my experience at the new south Scottsdale sushi spot.

Our water tasted bad. Lemon or cucumber might have helped, not sure. 
Spicey Salmon salad looked and tasted funny to both of us. 
Our last sushi dish came 35 minutes after our first. That is way too long guys.      We had been finished for 15 minutes and, had asked for the check when it finally appeared. We took it to go but, they didn't include any soy in the box so, we dumped it. 
Sake was lukewarm. 

Service was nice and friendly (thanks Katrina) and the squid salad was good. 

If this was my only choice, I might try them again but, several high quality spots just 2 miles away."}
{"text":"Excellent service, sushi is great , great friendly service, nice atmosphere.  Followed yelp recommendations and all the reviews and they where spot on.  A must if you're in the mood for sushi while in Phoenix."}
{"text":"Tried their chashu ramen,eel cucumber roll and ASU roll. They were all very excellent. We will be back. Also very good customer service."}
{"text":"This place is a hidden gem. We live in Scottsdale and Bei is one of our favorite places to eat. EVERYTHING IS GOOD AND FRESH. The Chasu ramen is incredible!! The restaurant is abut outdated but who cares, you're getting reasonably priced yet quality sushi!! Sometimes the sakes a bit watered down but that's only every now and then. They're friendly and fast and lunch menu rocks too."}
{"text":"A clean, fresh sushi joint by my house!  The baked scallop appetizer was so yummy!  We also ordered the Lollipop and the Vegas roll."}
{"text":"The Sushi rolls are pretty good. Liked the ambience too. Good service. The location of the place is also very convenient. Taste is very good also the prices for the happy hour are reasonable. The sushi is made fresh unlike the other place we went to."}
{"text":"I call B.S.!  We came based on the solid star rating but it was all false hype... I felt like this was a trap. 4.5 star rating and a boat load of reviews? I'm a sucker for believing them. And the magazine-like photos of artful, flawless Japanese cuisine I expected? Not even close!  Everything we saw online was so far from our real life experience that we literally thought we had gone to the wrong restaurant. So bad.

First off, the interior of the restaurant looks like it hasn't been updated since before I was born. Not kept up, rough around the edges and basically sad and rundown. We sat at the sushi bar which was EMPTY (that should've been a sign).  And the older sushi chef who was \"helping us\" seemed like he hated life.  And us. He clearly was not happy to be there and anything was ordered was met with a loathing look.  

We started with something easy-- shrimp tempura and Korean style chicken wings. Wings weren't bad but the tempura batter was overly thick, clunky and lacked flavor. Then the first round of sushi arrived. Bad. All bad. Even down to the chipped plates which were most likely harboring all kinds of other grossness. The fish looked like it was frozen then brought back up. Tough, rubbery, almost fake texture and look. It was the most unappealing fish is ever seen.

That was enough to cut our losses and find another sushi place right after. Never going back, never trusting Bei."}
{"text":"I have been going to Bei since it opened a few years ago.  I have usually had a good experience until today.  My wife and I went in for lunch and ended up leaving.  I had ordered a Bento Box as I always do for lunch. They always substitute additional tempura instead of the California roll. When the food showed up, it had the wrong substitution. Apparently the owner or manager delivered the food to the table because when I tried to explain what was wrong, he told me substitutions cost extra. He then went into the kitchen and started yelling at the employees about it in a way that everyone could here.  I got up and called him out so I could tell him that it was really unprofessional to be yelling at the employees while there were people all around.  In doing so I used a swear word while explaining. (My bad!)  He proceeded to berate me for swearing and couldn't care less about his yelling at the employees.  We decided to leave at that point. I left a tip for the waitress and on the way out tried to thank her and explain it wasn't her fault.  The owner came up to me again and started getting involved again following me outside as I left. It did not end well. Will never go back! Really unprofessional!"}
{"text":"Quick safe spot. Come here quite it bit for Pickup/ togo orders. Their Ramen is pretty good when feeling down. Haven't had anything i was disappointed with by this place. Its very reasonable pricing. For a good deal on sushi can't complain. Worth giving a shot for sure"}
{"text":"my advice to BEI since it sounds like your food is amazing... remodel your bathrooms and keep them clean.  didn't stay to try food because this place failed the first test... if you can't keep your bathroom clean and tidy then what does the kitchen look like?  Sticky floors=yuck"}
{"text":"Bei was awesome! Had a great happy hour even on xmas eve!! Had saki bombs and rolls and everything was awesome!"}
{"text":"I love bei sushi! The service is amazing! Especially the red headed waitress. She should get a promotion! You can tell she is a hard worker. I 10 out of 10 recommend this place"}
{"text":"Besides the fact that sushi is always fresh and tasty this establishment has some amazing people working for them. My boyfriend forgot his wallet there (he thought he lost it somewhere else and was searching for it all over the house). When we got back almost a month later they gave it back to him. Kelsey, our server from the last time we were there, kept it safe and returned it with everything untouched! Thank you guys!"}
{"text":"Great sushi and prices! We love it so much we've made it a holiday tradition to enjoy a family dinner here each year. We never have bad service or food. A definite must whether you're in the area or just looking for a great meal out!"}
{"text":"Delicious! And great service! And affordable! And a great legitimately Japanese ambiance. All the rolls we had were delicious but the vegetarian sweet potato rolls were surprisingly amazingly good. Happy hour prices were great too. And the man greeting us bowed. Twice. So nice and so Japanese! Loved it."}
{"text":"Absolutely loved this place! The sushi was fresh and delicious and the service was fantastic (thanks, Cody)!! Can't recommend him or this plan enough :)"}
{"text":"Sushi was super fresh and restaurant is very clean.  Service was top notch.  Will travel 25 miles again to get some freshi sushi!!  Happy hour menu is also good with lots of items."}
{"text":"No other words than outstanding.  Great atmosphere,  energy flows here.  Food was great. Pretty busy with attractive people."}
{"text":"Not sure how this place got such good reviews!  Went here based on yelp reviews and the whole place was extremely dirty, I totally lost my appetite.  Luckily we didn't get sick but would definitely not recommend."}
{"text":"Overall a well designed place. Our waiter was very attentive and made sure we had everything we needed. Service was overall speedy but one of our orders took quite a bit to come out. I got the sashimi bowl and was a little disappointed by how thin they were cut as well as them counting tamago as one of the sashimi pieces (it comes with six).  Pricing is a bit higher than needed for what I got. Had I received thicker slices I would of said it was fine however that wasn't the case. I would come back here again but I would definitely order something else."}
{"text":"The only reason this place doesn't get five stars is because the ambiance leaves a lot to be desired. The sushi is delicious, get the Alaskan roll!"}
{"text":"I went here for a quick lunch take out and got the Chicken Teriyaki Bento Box, so my review isn't about the sushi really. But it was really really good, and it was a ton of food and I was super impressed. It came with the chicken, rice, California roll (4 pc), gyoza (2 pc), vegetable tempura (sweet potato, zucchini, mushroom, onion), and a house salad with really good Asian dressing. All for $7.50! 

The chicken teriyaki was mixed with different vegetables and was good. The veggie tempura was probably my favorite. Even though I got it to go and it was at least 15 min to get back to the office and start eating, the tempura was still crispy and warm and was really good. I couldn't even finish everything. 

When I picked it up I was greeted right away and my food was ready in very quickly. The service was nice and I have no complaints. I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Lunch specials are awesome. Reverse Happy Hour has a decent selection.  

Not bad sushi. Was better when they first opened a few years back though

I only reviewed this to get free Mochi though."}
{"text":"Very delicious, best we have found in Scottsdale. This is the closest to San Diego sushi as it comes....the calamari roll yum yum."}
{"text":"This place is fantastic! It is definitely for the younger crowd. They play music really loud on weekends and the lights are kept low. The food come out very quick and is always delicious. They have vegetarian options as well."}
{"text":"Salmon nigiri... Simply the best! We are always treated like family even when they are busy. In fact, one of the owners shared his Mom's homemade Kim Chee with me. We don't need to ask for gluten free soy or Soju because the owners and staff simply remember."}
{"text":"Moving here from San Diego we decided to try Bei because we're on the hunt for good sushi in the Valley and it has a 4 star rating. First impression wasn't great. It has a very odd layout. When you walk in you see a bar with a few TVs, and I don't mean a sushi bar. You then have to walk around the corner to get to the sushi bar, so it felt like the sushi wasn't the focus. I can get past a weird layout and disjointed vibe if the sushi and service is good though. Our service wasn't great even though there was almost no one else there. Our server mumbled and wasn't very friendly. The miso was too salty. We decided the best word to describe the sushi was \"underwhelming\". It wasn't the worst sushi I have ever had by any means, but it sure was far from the best. Our sushi craving was not satisfied for $60 so we definitely won't be back."}
{"text":"Everything about this place reminded me of a small, modern sushi joint you would only find on the West Coast (Seattle, Portland or San Francisco).  Loved the service, but the sushi was as fresh as you'll find to top things off.  This place is a hit for sushi lovers."}
{"text":"My go to sushi bar due to its ambience, happy hour pricing, and the awesome friendly staff. The rice is always soft, fresh and sticky. I keep coming back and bringing my family and friends."}
{"text":"I'm having dinner with my mom,dad,and my little brother.It was kinda good and  it was peaceful.I thought the miso soup was really salty.But at least the California roll was super yummy.We also got free mochi !"}
{"text":"Stopped in for lunch to try some place new. The restaurant was very clean and nicely decorated. We sat down and ordered off the lunch menu. Very good prices for all they had to offer. I ordered the sushi roll combo and my friend ordered the chicken teriyaki box. We really got a lot for what we paid for. I got 2 big sushi rolls and ended up taking 1 of the rolls home to go. The chicken teriyaki box was also very large with a variety of items. Service was very good and we will be back."}
{"text":"Great sushi, very much enjoyed the volcano roll and Yellowtail nigiri. Happy hour here creates a great opportunity for college students"}
{"text":"Great place to eat! Love the happy hour deals! The service was also quick and promptly and the server we had (forgot her name) was very helpful and knowledgeable about the menu! Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"It was my first time here and the sushi was so good!! We got the volcano, philly, vegas, calamari, and scallops rolls and they were all big portions."}
{"text":"Since moving to AZ I've struggled to find a good sushi spot. Bei has been the saving grace I need. The volcano and Vegas roll will satisfy your wildest dreams make sure to go to Happy hour and the service is on point!"}
{"text":"One of my favorite place for a rice bowl! They are big bowls with lots of rice and meats on top. Tasty, good big portion, and reasonable price."}
{"text":"The place is large and clean. Extended menu i.e Happy Hours, July special and vegetarian friendly. Great prices."}
{"text":"I come here with my boyfriend probably about once a week. Happy hour is fantastic, great price and VERY fresh sushi as well as creative rolls! Service is great, and experience overall will not dissapoint!"}
{"text":"Went here for happy hour-good drink specials. Went with my Japanese friend, always a good idea in these places. 

Well, we both loved it. I had the spicy udon dish which was awesome. The noodle soup was also good. Sushi was good and fresh. The bartender was molasses in January slow, so wave your arms wildly and you WILL get her attention. 

They were actually very busy, mainly young couples and the mood was good. I will go again, try some more of that sushi!"}
{"text":"I was with a handful of women when I went to Scottsdale, AZ for a Women's Empowerment retreat and we have a day to ourselves before the shenanigans happen. So my friend was planning to meet up with her cousin who lives in Tempe.. so I asked her to if I could tag along and they were cool with it. They (cousin and the fiance) picked us up from our hotel and headed out to Bei.

Atmosphere/Ambiance:

I like the atmosphere here because it was not your regular quiet sushi place.. it was more like a sushi restaurant + sports bar with bunch of TV's + live bands on certain days type of combination. There wasn't any live bands when we went but they were playing good music.

Food:

- Love Hurts Roll (Crab Mix, Avocado, Topped with Baked White Fish with Spicy Aioli, and Eel Sauce, Scallions, Sriracha): really good spiciness from the Spicy Aoili & Sriracha, the White Fish portion was decent and the sushi didn't fall apart after a bite.
- Chicken Teriyaki entree (Chicken teriyaki, steamed rice, vegetable tempura, miso soup, house salad): it was more like a Chicken Teriyaki sizzling plate! I wished they wrote that it's a sizzling plate entree than a regular entree.. but regardless it was good portion... I enjoyed my vegetable tempura the most.

Service:

Our server was pretty attentive to us since even though it was getting a bit busy by the time we ordered our food.


In the end, it was a great place that my friends cousin had picked and I can see myself coming back here in the future. It seemed like a great place for Happy hour shenanigans too."}
{"text":"Date night dreams! Sushi was amazinnnnng (las vegas, volcano, lobster tempura, plus sake bomb thank you happy hour) it was everything I wanted and more. Our waitress Tikra was the bomb! Loved her service and her hair!"}
{"text":"I've been wanting to try this place since I called to order my Tai dinner one night from Lao & was told it was gonna be a sushi restaurant, awhile ago now. Finally got the opportunity this night. 
The floor plan is much smaller than what Lao Tai had to offer (for a group of two or four your just fine). K & I ordered a lot of food as K had been camping for the last five days & was quite hungry. All of the appetizers we had were very yummy. Because of our hunger & it happening to be happy hour we ordered 9 different types of sushi! There was only one of the 9 that was not to our likening. 
We were very pleasantly greeted & seated, but am sad to say our waitress & overall service was less than enthusiastic. It is really unfortunate because we are a family of sushi lovers, & I will now hesitate to return, even just for take-out."}
{"text":"Hands down the best sushi place in town. Food is on point and staff is very friendly and really great service. I'll list down my favorite's that i definitely recommend:

Sunshine roll (for salmon lovers)
Tootsie roll
Spicy tuna roll
Love hurts roll
Las vegas roll
Stuffed mushroom"}
{"text":"Best sushi I've had in a long time. Happy hour prices are unbeatable too. Las Vegas, Nebraska, and Volcano rolls were amazing!"}
{"text":"Best sushi ever! Love this place bc everything is so fresh and tasty. I will be back. Tikra was our server and she was awesome!!"}
{"text":"This place was delicious. The service was awesome. My husband and I had an aloe beitini and a Kirin. My tini was amazing. So refreshing! You couldn't taste the alcohol at all. We had the Bei special roll, a red dragon, and a volcano roll. They were all fabulous. We had our 11 month old daughter with us, and they were so attentive to her. They brought us miso soup and a small bowl of steamed rice, complementary. She loved it. Total, we spent just over $43 plus a tip. We will definitely be back and we can't wait have family come to visit so we can take them too"}
{"text":"Delicious fresh sushi! The prices were extremely reasonable and he service was fast and friendly! Highly recommend"}
{"text":"The lunch specials are so reasonably priced for what you get. The raw fish is very fresh. I also like the tempura vegetables. This is our go to sushi lunch spot."}
{"text":"Suuuuper happy about bei. Up until they came into town, my bf and I would drive all the way from n. Scottsdale to Tempe marketplace for kabuki. Bei is easily as good as Kabuki, with super fresh sushi served at the exact right temperature. Very attentive and timely service. I judge a sushi restaurant by the hamachi and sake, and bei passed with flying colors. I'm also thankful they don't overdo the whole Americanized fried rolls with heavy mayo sauces. Always nice to see Mochi ice cream on the menu:)"}
{"text":"Oh my god, so good! Definitely coming back! Service was  great food was great! Love love love! Been here a few times!"}
{"text":"i love this place.... great customer service and my tummy is really happy. the flavor are all fresh and shushi just melt in your mouth....will be back happy customer"}
{"text":"Came here for my birthday dinner earlier this month since this place has almost 5 stars and figured it would surely be a great experience. 

There were 5 or 6 other parties dining in addition to my 2 person party (it was not a busy night by any means). It took almost 15 minutes for our waiter to even greet us. I mean it was to the point of getting really awkward and I almost walked back up the hostess to ask if we could please just get some water. Finally ordered some water and two mixed drinks. After nearly 10 more minutes, ONE of the mixed drinks arrived. Another 5 or 7 minutes go by and I ask our waiter if my drink is coming and he said 'oh yes it's on it's way'. I get my drink a few more minutes later (it only had 2 ingredients according to the menu) so I assume he forgot about it somehow. Then I ask if we can please get the waters also (at this point we had been there for more than 30 min). 

We ordered our food and it arrived in an appropriate amount of time. The sushi was good and the green tea tempura ice cream was good too. It's just such a shame that the service was so awful. We had at least 3 different waiters including, I think, a bus boy at one point who clearly didn't have experience waiting tables. What gave that away was when he stopped by our table and pointed at my drink and said \"is that thing any good?\"  

Just a really strange dining experience and the wait staff seem really lost and confused."}
{"text":"I had the chance to enjoy their Happy Hour last Saturday. Since they just opened they were pretty empty, but I feel with the quality of food they serve that will not last for long.  We ate the spring rolls, salmon sushi, the Las Vegas Roll, and the assorted sashimi. The all the items we delicious and fresh. I was very impressed by the size of the roll and it wasn't overly cream cheesy. Cannot wait to come back to try more items."}
{"text":"Bei has an amazing happy hour that changes monthly with lots of great discounts on sushi. Everything is fresh and tastes delicious! They have a good selection of golden rolls to appeal to everyone. Would highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Ummmm am I allowed to write an update one day later? LOL... went last night and tried the Love Hurts roll.... SO. GOOD!! Go try it, you can thank me later. ;)"}
{"text":"It is so awesome here. The hours are reasonable especially for night owls like me. They always provide quality service (no matter the time of day). It is a very relaxed scene with good food. I always get the beef teriyaki bowl entree and my boyfriend gets the chicken bowl entree. It comes with a soup and a salad. Definitely a lot of food for a good price. Excited to try their mochi. I highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"If you don't eat a lot of sushi then the place is good.   But if you can identify quality sushi, this is not the place for you.  The venue itself is good, but based on reviews by other people the sushi was a disappointment."}
{"text":"The spicy Chasi bowl was delicious, along with the soju aloe cocktail! We also had the gyoza and the spicy yellowtail row and they were amazing!"}
{"text":"I've gone here three times recently to watch MLS soccer games that are subject to broadcast blackouts.  The staff has been very friendly and remembered I was there to watch the soccer game even when customers who came in later wanted to watch other games and Chang even knows a thing or two about soccer.  I've talked to him on my last two visits.  There are about 10 TVs here so there are plenty to go around.

The food here is good too.  They know how to make good iced tea (i.e. not bitter), which by the way goes well with pickled ginger, and the sushi I've had here has been as good as any I've had here in the valley.  My favorite so far is the sashimi salad, but I still have to make my way around the rest of the menu during the remainder of the MLS playoffs."}
{"text":"The food is great but the service tonight was awful. Talk about a rude staff! If you can't be friendly to people than stop working in customer service! Simple as that. Reevaluate your staff bei. I've been here multiple times and had 2 of the same male waiters who were not there tonight. They're great, as for the lady and man working take outs tonight, not so great. If someone asks for 8 packets of soy sauce just give it to them! Don't sit there and roll your eyes and say \"I put 5 in there already\". Make the customers happy!"}
{"text":"I was really hoping this could be my new sushi haunt--my old favorite was also right next to a Fascinations so I thought that was a good sign. However, I was underwhelmed by the food here. I felt like there was too much cucumber in the spicy tuna, and the rolls with crab in them were too creamy. I think they had too much mayo in them. I'm sure a dismayed chef might say, \"they didn't even have mayo in them!\" But that's just my guess. Something was off about them. They weren't terrible, but not great either. The food had a really good presentation; it was just not very flavorful. They also forgot to bring out one of the items I ordered, which would have been far more forgivable if the food was good. I'll continue my search for an excellent sushi restaurant in the East Valley. 

In sum, I give this restaurant a rating of \"meh.\""}
{"text":"Tikra had the best service and was so personable! We will be back for sure! Great sushi, great happy hour prices! Thank you so much!!!"}
{"text":"Service was great. Ambiance causal. Food OK - Cali roll yummy, teriyaki bowl is a solid amount of food but just ok-tasting. I would come again if I were hungry and wanted Asian. Free mochi for this review which is cool."}
{"text":"This place is good cheap and sushi is fresh always great service, we always come here!
Honestly this is our go to when I want to eat cheap, sushi, japanese/korean food and they always keep the kitchen open late."}
{"text":"Good sushi selection and happy hour prices! Food came out quickly and staff was very responsive. Came with a large group and had an overall nice experience."}
{"text":"Amazing and unique sushi reasonably priced great atmosphere cool bar and excellent service"}
{"text":"I love coming here for lunch and ordering the bento box. You get a large assortment of yummy food. Too large to actually finish it. Prices are very reasonable and the service is always prompt and friendly"}
{"text":"This was awesome food and almost more importantly the service was super friendly and crazy fast! Lovely live music was had as well. I very much enjoyed the Blazing Alaska and the stuffed jalapeños. Also the Bei punch, though no doubt enough sugar to kill me, was delicious! First time here and I'll be back! Good times"}
{"text":"Excellent sushi, friendly staff. Not the fanciest joint in the world, but the food speaks for itself. The lunch specials are priced very well. I'm looking forward to trying this place at night. Well done, Bei!"}
{"text":"Very decent place to get sushi. Everything was pretty good. I love the Scottsdale Roll. The place is big but wasn't crowded or busy. Nothing special and just an average sushi place but definitely a place to go if you want some good sushi in Arizona."}
{"text":"Honestly, my experience here was so quick & I didn't try anything except for a few basic rolls, but I like what I saw & ate, and based on that I'd definitely come back. 

Bei is probably the closest sushi place to my house & sushi is one of those things I don't eat often, but when I crave it, I CRAVE it. I wish this place had a website because I got takeout. I decided to just to stop in, order, and wait. The place itself was spacious & seemed nice enough to dine in at. 

Since I was trying this place for the first time I ordered three basic rolls as a \"test.\" I got a CA roll, Philly roll & honestly I don't remember exactly what the third roll was except that it was a pretty basic shrimp tempura roll. The fish tasted fresh in all three.

I was just testing this place for future reference, and it passed. I'd especially come back for Happy Hour. I believe it runs everyday (maybe not Sun?), and goes from 4:30-7:30. There are several rolls for under 3 bucks. 

There aren't a lot (any, really) sushi options in this area, which makes Bei even more appealing."}
{"text":"I love everything we have tried here! Spicy crab rolls and spicy Ramen are my top 2 favorites though! Great service , super clean, great prices and portions! All around  5 stars!"}
{"text":"Quick place to grab sushi. The service is okay and the quality of the food is hit or miss."}
{"text":"3.5 stars

The husband and I went for Christmas dinner because we had cooked up a storm for our Christmas Eve feast with our sister & brother in law. It was just the two of us and we were both craving sushi. The rolls are on the pricier side but they were pretty good. The fish wasn't the freshest but overall was decent. The service was a bit slow considering there weren't that many tables."}
{"text":"Great sushi happy hour! Awesome miso soup! I loved the volcano roll OMG! It was too die for! Edamame only $1.95, sushi for $3.50 & rolls are $5.95-9.95. Want beer? Stella's for $3.95, large Japanese beers like Kirin for $4.95! Friendly staff, great tunes - they're bumping some fun music & have live music on Thursdays! 
I'd like to see more sushi & rolls on the Happy Hour menu, but overall a great find close to home!"}
{"text":"I love Bei! Their sushi is great and very affordable. The staff is always friendly and provides great service! Bei is my favorite local spot!"}
{"text":"A little known gem in south Scottsdale. Better sushi at better prices than most in the area. Their happy hour is legendary as well. Tuna lovers role does not require you loving tuna cause it's amazing."}
{"text":"(My Mobile Tip) Wow. These guys are seriously friendly! I have like 4 different menus to take back to work.  

I ordered the lunch special - Chicken Teriyaki Box - $7.25.  You get a lot of food for the price you pay!  

The chicken teri was not overly sweet or breaded.  The dumplings (goyza) or some may refer to this as potstickers, were steamed/pan fried.  J would have loved them.  I'm not really a big fan of potstickers.  The sauce was not the traditional scallion dipping sauce, but a soy citrus sauce.  Standard fare with the california roll and veg tempura.  I will say that the tempura was not greasy, which was a good thing.  And the house salad came with an awesome ginger dressing.  

When I got back to work and started eating at my desk, I had quite a few colleagues ask where I went and that it smelled fantastic.  I'll have to admit, I did \"stink\" up the area.  It smelled awesome!  

OH - I noticed that they have high chairs in their restaurant, so that tells me that the place is toddler friendly.  Which for a mom, that is very important.  Not always can you find a babysitter.  

I'm sure J, Little C, and I will stop by one evening for an early supper.  :)"}
{"text":"Best sushi place in town. Come for happy hour. Best prices and selection on sushi and drinks. Open late as well"}
{"text":"do not eat here, their employees like to write in large tips for themselves on your receipt and then when you call to ask for the manager they say there isn't one. There was only 2 of us who ate so it was NOT the 18% gratuity for 6 people automatically charged. Ridiculous!"}
{"text":"This place is amazing!! They have the best seaweed salad and Las Vegas rolls. Service is always really good too :)"}
{"text":"I ordered the teriyaki bowl and I was pretty pleased, they have a good atmosphere, great food and excellent service. I would definitely recommend for a quick bite or a dinner date."}
{"text":"This place from the outside is kind of sketch. But it is great on the inside.  The service was awesome,  the sushi came out a little slower than normal... but it's worth it. I will definitely be back again!"}
{"text":"Bae- the type of girl when your at your absolute worst knows how to bring you to your absolute best :) she knows you loves you and cares about you !

here's the deal with sushi most of it sucks d/(k at  fuh(king p3ssy.... but not bei!!!! 

Bei- the type of sushi when your at your absolute worst knows how to bring you to your absolute best :) bei knows me,  bei loves me,  bei cares about me and guess bei knows how to get in my belly. 

Their raw fish clearly jumped out of Noah's ark. 

Their sauce came straight from Japan in the Himalayas 

Their booze came straight from jack sparrows liquor cabinet 

What can I say grab your Bae and come to bei 


Shout out to mellisa the server who is a 10/10 in making dreams happen. What up bei"}
{"text":"First time here, great experience. Service was fast and attentive even during happy hour. Atmosphere is very mellow, great after work spot to unwind. Happy hour is good especially on the alcohol side.

To be safe as first timers we started with our usuals and ordered the miso soup, cucumber salad, garlic edename, albacore nigiri and California roll. We wanted to get the full Bei experience so we ordered two specialty rolls as well, the Nebraska roll and the Lollipop roll.

I recommend it all but don't waste space in your appetite with a California roll although quite good, go for the specialty rolls, they won't dissapoint.

I'm not a roll fan so finding a roll that was not all rice was a delightful find. The lollipop roll has salmon, tuna, yellowtail, avocado and crab mix wrapped in cucumber and it is awesome.

My husband enjoyed the Nebraska roll which he enjoyed but I couldn't tell you what was in it. I kow it had spicy tuna, lol. Guess you'll have to go in and try it for yourself."}
{"text":"Good food. Plenty of options. Fair prices. They lost a star because no one came to great us for about 5 minutes."}
{"text":"I have made this a regular stop on the way to Sky Harbor airport from Chandler when traveling on business.  My favorites are the Volcano Roll and Las Vegas Roll plus they are very reasonably discounted between 4:30 and 7pm.  The service is great and the staff is very friendly and accommodating.  I plan on returning to try just about everything I can!"}
{"text":"I Love Bei! I come here at least once a week, it is my favorite sushi spot. The Nebraska roll is my #1 favorite! Awesome staff and ambiance."}
{"text":"Service is great, food is amazing! The fish is so fresh whether you get sashimi or a roll your going leave satisfied. I typically get sashimi when I go out, but it's hard to find large pieces that are actually good, so this place really hits the spot! Plus the Bei special roll offer so many different kinds of fish so you get a variety in one dish if you aren't familiar with fish."}
{"text":"Ordered in sushi right before they closed. Everything was ready when I got there. the guys were really nice! Sushi was awesome and miso soup was perfect."}
{"text":"I really like it here. The music, the tv's, the seating. The sushi rolls are always good, our favorite specialty roll is the Dynomite. We've gotten that a few times. Happy Hour prices are great too!"}
{"text":"We've been here a few times and its always been really good. Sushi is on point, service is really good and we like the quietness of this establishment. We've had their miso soup, multiple kinds of sushi rolls, the egg rolls and the potstickers and everything is delicious. We tend to come around happy hour to save a little money. You can't really go wrong here! Oh! And if you've already reviewed this place on yelp just let them know and they'll give you free mochi ice cream, it's so good!!!"}
{"text":"I finally got to try Bei out this past weekend and had a great experience. We went on a Friday night and were greeted with a friendly welcome and got a table right away. We got an order of the spring rolls, I got the citrus ahi tuna sashimi, and my boyfriend got their chicken katsu bowl.

The spring rolls and the bowl came out right away. The spring rolls were delicious. I'm usually not a fan of them, but these were crispy and had just the right amount of vegetables. It wasn't greasy or heavy. I tried the chicken katsu and it was really good too. Unfortunately, my ahi took some time to come out. However, it was definitely worth the wait. The tuna was super fresh and I loved the citrus ginger sauce on it and the avocados. I will definitely be back just for that!

The prices are very reasonable and they also have lunch specials and happy hour. They have a pretty extensive menu so I'm sure there's something for everyone, even if you're not a fan of sushi."}
{"text":"Bri was awesome!! One of my family's favorite sushi restaurants!! The new June rolls are great all thought the volcano roll is my favorite!"}
{"text":"Surprisingly good sushi! Sat at the sushi bar - friendly chefs and really great service. I was given a yummy cucumber/crab salad as an appetizer :)

It was happy hour (4:30-7, 9-close). Prices were discounted $1-2, but even regular price wasn't bad (as a referenced, a Shrimp Tempura Roll is $6.95). Best deal was the $2.50 house hot sake!"}
{"text":"My favorite sushi place in town. Good happy hour times and fairly decent prices on happy hour rolls. Plus the HH menu changes every month so you can always switch it up. 
It's small enough to have a bit of a personal feel, and they always have sports on the TVs. It's clean and the food is bomb. Definitely recommend!"}
{"text":"A wonderful menu full of whatever you are craving. Good prices great happy hour. Everything tasted amazing. Would definitely recommend/ go here again."}
{"text":"Love this place. $6.95 sake bombers is their normal price. Comes with the large Kirin beer! I love the spicy tuna rolls!"}
{"text":"Extremely unpleasant experience. AVOID. 

After reading the reviews about this place I thought it was worth a shot. The sushi was basic at best. Ordered the Alaskan role as the server had recommended it, needless to say it was not good. The spicy tuna tasted fishy and the roll was just not good to the taste. Upon sending it back the restaurant owner JT came over to ask me about why I didn't like it. I politely responded with what I thought and left it at that. He then proceeded to ask me if I had ever been to his restaurant and explained that all spicy tuna recipes are different. I told him that was fine and said I didn't like it. A few moments later he returned to our table to continue on about spicy tuna recipes and how many people order that role and never complain. I couldn't believe this fellow was arguing with me about a roll. 

When the bill arrived I asked the server about the charge - I didn't care about the cost, but the principal. JT came over and explained that his restaurant policy is that if you order it you pay for it. This roll was recommended by the server, and I explained that when something doesn't taste good most restaurant owners would encourage guests to say something. He argued with me so much so that I had to tell him that he was being quite rude and I asked that he please run my card five times. He made a huge scene and would not stop talking about his policy. I would never recommend someone come here - Heaven forbid the food is terrible, management doesn't care because you ordered it and it isn't their fault. 

Buyer beware. Avoid this place."}
{"text":"Probably the fastest I've ever gotten a sushi order. Great happy hour available even on weekends! Check it out !"}
{"text":"Have been coming here for years. Great sushi, and off the beaten track. Sunshine roll is amazing. And the spicy crispy chicken."}
{"text":"Really friendly service, delicious food, and a great sushi happy hour. Check it out if your looking for sushi."}
{"text":"Amazing restaurant! Been going to this location for over a year and highly recommend it :) No matter how many times I try other places, I always come back to my BEI (get it?). I would suggest the dragon roll. I get it every time!"}
{"text":"I had passed this place so many times in Scottsdale and never realized it was there until I found them on Yelp.  They were super close and I decided to give them a try.  I'm so glad I did because now they are somewhere that I go to quite often.  

They are usually pretty busy for dinner but the food is always good.  I'm a sushi lover, so I have tried a lot of the rolls, but one of my favorites is the Alaska Roll. It's salmon, avocado, and crab. 

The best deal though is for lunch during the week. They have some great specials and when you check in you get a miso soup. I always get the two sushi rolls and you can pick from any of the basic rolls.  There are so many other options though if you don't like sushi or even fish. 

The reason for me taking off 1 star is sometimes the service can be slow and during the work week when you're in a time crunch, that is an issue. The other issue I have, and I don't what it is with the spicy tuna roll but there is something about it that I don't like. I love spicy tuna usually so this was a disappointment to me."}
{"text":"Best sushi and awesome happy hour! We love going to this place! I recommend for all to try it out! Service is AMAZING every time too!"}
{"text":"Cool vibe with a nice bar and simple modern décor. Service was excellent and so was the Sushi and miso soup. I will be going back."}
{"text":"This has been our family's sushi spot for years! We come for birthdays and holidays. The service is great and the food is amazing and fresh! 10/10 would recommend!"}
{"text":"This place is too over rated.  The food is average at best. I ordered the udon noodles with beef.  There was very little beef,  and mainly noodles.  The sushi was nothing amazing. It's also over priced for what they sell.  You're mainly paying the price for being in Scottsdale."}
{"text":"Very interesting.  Sushi rice is moist and fresh, with very interesting twists on sushi.  We had their Bei special, which is a take on crab rolls (fake crab stuff), topped with scallops, creamy spicy mayo and baked - very filling and anti-health if you are watching calories, but very very tasty.

LOVED their raw salmon tartare and their butterfish.  Delicate dishes packing lots of flavor.  They have great bento boxes (HUGE) and lunch specials.  

I was turned off by the \"old\"/worn feeling of the place, but nicely tended to by a great server.  Not the best sushi I've had in Phoenix, but not the worst."}
{"text":"Vegas roll is my favorite. I always come here for the happy hour! Great service and relaxed environment to eat at!"}
{"text":"Some yelpers are crazy, this place is excellent. Yes there are places out there that are better, yes it isn't a flashy \"place to be seen\", but the food is great. 1 and 2 stars because it wasn't your favorite? Complaining about $60 for 2 at a sushi joint? I've paid $400 for 2 at a high end sushi restaurant that wasn't as good, gtfoh."}
{"text":"Glad to be back to AZ and craving some sushi. Once my father told me \"if you want fresh fish, eat at the coast, you won't find fresh fish in the desert\"  I guess times have changed.

The place looks nice, on a strip mall, the ambiance is kind of cold, seamed to me like of a old breakfast place. I sat at the bar that is oddly positioned at the entrance and at first smelled a bit like floor cleaner

The warmth of the place is on the service, fast friendly and with a smile.

My beer was cold, off to a good start.

Menu offers some different spins on the traditional and great variety of dishes without being overwhelming.

I ordered some salon sashimi and a couple of different sushi.


I was a bit disappointed even though the quality and fat of the fish seemed good it had a slight \"fridge\" taste. May be the way the store it is not the beast? I don't know nevertheless killed my will to come again

Safe yelping"}
{"text":"Good stuff ...was fast and fresh...checkerboard roll was my favorite. Wish they had a couple baked rolls but overall five stars...will def be back"}
{"text":"UPDATED REVIEW - July 2017 (one star): 
If I could give it no stars, I would.  After years of patronizing Bei, and having great service, we stopped in yesterday.  We had not been in for several months, and missed it.  Well, never again.  Our waitress was nice, a little on the sad side (she looked like she'd been crying), came to take our order, and my husband, who loves the bento boxes and always orders them, but doesn't like sushi, asked for his usual chicken teriyaki bento box, but asked for them not to give him the sushi roll, and just some extra tempura instead - this is something they have always done for him, no problem.  I really wouldn't even count it as a substitution, as they are just throwing in a couple of extra vegetable tempuras! He assured our waitress that it has never been an issue about this slight alteration, and she said that was fine.  When she brought our food, she had mistakenly omitted the gyoza (which he wanted), and left the sushi, which he didn't).  He brought it up to her, and that's when the manager came by.  He started berating us about no substitutions, and did not want to correct the order.  He was very rude about it, even as my husband politely explained that no one has ever declined his request before.  Finally, after a somewhat unpleasant exchange, the manager finally, very unkindly, said he would make the change this one time. Dude, it's a couple of vegetable tempura vs. one california roll, for a customer that's been coming in since you opened. 

It gets worse. So after finally making this concession, the manager goes to the waitress, who is in the kitchen, but right inside the doorway.  He starts yelling and shouting at her, so loudly that whole restaurant can hear. I cannot remember the last time I felt this uncomfortable in a restaurant.  He went on and on and on, very loudly, and very derisively.  It was seriously one of the most abusive displays I have ever witnessed between a manager and staff in a dining establishment.  My husband got up and asked him to stop yelling at the waitress.  The manager was extremely rude to my husband, and at this point, he was fed up and just told the manager to stop effing being so rude and hateful to the waitress.  The manager refused to back down, and instead attacked my husband for his language. The irony of it all.  At that point there was no way we were going to eat there, so we left.  My husband tried to tell the waitress on our way out that the events were not her fault, and the manager once again stepped in and started yelling at my husband, following us out and continuing to harass us. I seriously have never seen this manager before, I don't know if he's new, but he seriously has no idea what good customer service and staff management looks like. I feel for the staff at Bei.  I cannot imagine that working with this man every day isn't some kind of hell.

Past review (2013)

My husband and I were running errands in the area on a Saturday (1/4/13) and tried to stop at DeFalco's for a quick bite...couldn't get in the door.  So drove down to Bei, someplace we'd been meaning to try.  Couldn't have been happier.  The food was excellent (I had the oyako don, and my husband had one of their bento box lunches with teriyaki chicken).  Our server was awesome.  The place was nicely decorated, with a great little bar area.  We will definitely be back, need to give the sushi bar a go this next time!"}
{"text":"Attentive service. Casual atmosphere and good tasting food. I had the sake called Hana in White Peach flavor (I think) and it was awesome. Would come back again."}
{"text":"We ordered sashimi entree and spicy chicken noodle. The noodle was pretty good but the sashimi entree was ridiculous. It's was tiny for 15$ only 5 pieces of sashimi and 12 small pieces of california roll. Also, the fish were thin sliced. It was not worth 15$ for sure. If it was 8$ i won't complain but quality and quantity doesnt match the price."}
{"text":"Nice staff. Quick service. The lunch Bento box was huge. I think another trip would be better to try something other then the lunch specials. 
I will be back again for happy hour or dinner and have a beer or two. Bar looked pretty good."}
{"text":"I came here with lunch with 6 people. I got the California roll and the shrimp Tamera roll * I might be misspelling that*. The miso soup was amazing and the sushi was fresh and tasty. The waitress was really nice and patience.

I will be coming back often , I wish I would have known this was here before now. I love this place, someone needs to do their marketing and get their name out there. So thankful I found them on Yelp. We are even making plans on coming back today with 12 people! :) Thanks Yelp for helping me find my new favorite sushi place"}
{"text":"Best sushi place in all of Scottsdale!!! Best prices and such great sushi! My waiter Gabe was SPECTACULAR! BEST SERVICE I HAVE EVER HAD! I would definitely come back and request Gabe as my waiter!!"}
{"text":"Stopped by this neighborhood sushi place for reverse happy hour...the prices are some of the best in town...sometimes you get what you pay for. Service is great...super friendly...the sushimi is a touch soft in consistency, but still pretty good for the price. The rice is really bad though...I kept trying to eat it but it was just really poorly made. We took the fish off the rice. The salmon was fresh when off the rice...the albacore was good as well...the flavor of the ramen was excellent...touch salty but overall would get ramen again...overall it's not bad at all...just cannot give it 4 stars and be honest about it. Again service is exceptional...sushi is good...and you get free miso soup and free Mochi with Yelp check in and review, respectively."}
{"text":"This place is awesome, they have a great happy hour deals.. the sushi was a good price"}
{"text":"Excellent variety of rolls. Delicious garlic edamame and gyoza! (Highly recommend) Ordered the Rolls Royce roll and it lived up to the name. Strongly recommend this restaurant in general. Great food, great service, and clean restaurant!"}
{"text":"They have a pretty great happy hour. An amazing deal was their small bottle of peach saki on happy hour. It was surprisingly great tasting and not too sweet. Just trust me and order it! We ordered the Salmon Kama appetizer, the Bei stuffed mushroom appetizer, and quite a few rolls. Both appetizers were plentiful and very good!"}
{"text":"This is a great spot in the old town area to get sushi. It's fresh and clean, and the foods good and they're always friendly here. Plus, there is a reverse happy hour that starts after 9 PM and it's pretty good deal so I recommend checking it out."}
{"text":"Loooove the miso soup and spicy chicken noodle. Amazing service. My water was never empty. Cool atmosphere and Tikra is my favorite."}
{"text":"This is one of my first reviews because I usually do not take the time and am skeptical about reviews. I am not what you would call a foodie but I appreciate good food and think I have good taste. I purchased a couple of things to go and was very, very impressed even though most food does not translate as well when ordered to go. I ordered the spicy crispy chicken entree and shrimp tempura and they were excellent. I am chomping at the bit to go eat in the dining room because if it was this good to go I can imagine it will be even better to eat in. I live very close to this restaurant and do not want to see it go away so please take my review with a grain of salt but give it a try and I will bet you will be impressed."}
{"text":"Amazing love it it's really good I had a great time everything is super cute! :p but also don't miss out on miso soup my guy or the mochi Idk I'm really hungry I just downloaded this app for this."}
{"text":"The sushi here is great! Very fresh and flavorful. The service is always great as well. I always get the California roll and vegas roll."}
{"text":"Stay away there sushi is the worst ever they fool you with their prices frozen food not good"}
{"text":"Not a fancy restaurant but nice comfortable environment with friendly services. Their ramen noodle tastes really good. Sushi are freshly made. Happy hours are everyday 4:30-7:00, and 9:00-close. Even it's not happy hours, still very good deal."}
{"text":"This was a decent sushi place. Happy hour prices are good, the sushi is solid and miso soup is above average. Our server was very efficient and we were able to get our order in and food in quick succession. If I'm in this part of town and going for sushi, I'd definitely consider coming back."}
{"text":"I ate lunch here again today.  I think this is my 3rd or 4th time to eat lunch here in the past year.  I like it.  I always get the chicken teriyaki box which comes with chicken teriyaki, 6 pieces of California rolls, rice, some deep-fried vegetables and 2 pot stickers.  It's good food at a good value."}
{"text":"Stopped in here on a Saturday night for reverse happy hour and loved the place. There is a good vibe, the staff was extremely friendly, and the prices very reasonable. Definitely will be back."}
{"text":"I used to eat here all the time. Simple. Good. Went there on a Sunday at 9:20pm when they close at 10pm, and as soon as we walked in they said the kitchen was closed. All signs said sushi and happy hour sushi until 10pm. I wonder if the owner knows the staff is closing up shop early and turning away customers? Either way there's many more sushi spots in the nearby area to go to that follow their posted hours."}
{"text":"This is my favorite sushi place! I love their happy hour specials and all their sushi rolls. Everything is high quality, ready quickly, and served by someone friendly."}
{"text":"Best sushi place in Scottsdale! I have tried several other places nearby. Great happy hour deals and very cheap prices! :)"}
{"text":"When Dozo Closed a couple months ago my friends and I were so bummed. So we decided to check out BEI! Good Shit man! The food was fantastic, the happy hour prices were great and the staff was friendly. I sincerely appreciate the work ethic and grace the Asian culture presents with food. Constantly checking up on you, having your plate removed as soon as you finish your food. It made us feel welcome and taken care of.  My only complaint is the Nigiri is a little on the high side price, but its worth it :)"}
{"text":"I'd give Bei a 3.5. Who ever the Yelpers are that compare it to Shin Bay, have obviously never been to Shin Bay. Not even close to Hiro, for that matter. We're talking Ra or Kona Grill at best. 

For shame fellow Yelpers, let's just call a spade, a spade. It's passable sushi in Scottsdale. 

For those who disagree...get out more. Try real sushi."}
{"text":"Bei is great for late night sushi. The environment is relaxed and casual. I was very satisfied with the cleanliness and the polite staff. I got free miso for checking in and ordered the avocado, spicy salmon, and sweet potato rolls. They were all delicious (my favorite was definitely the sweet potato). Overall a fantastic experience dining at Bei. My parting impression was not as fantastic though, our waiter didn't check on our table for quite a long time after we were finished eating. That's my only complaint but otherwise the food and yelp promotions were great!"}
{"text":"it was prepared and presented well, but it just wasn't good, its not the chefs, its the recipes. if you want good sushi go to stingray. fish was good quality though"}
{"text":"Bei sushi is one of the best sushi bars in the Scottsdale area, the rolls are fantastic, excellent happy hour prices, TVs behind the bar, and the service is top-notch!"}
{"text":"Best sushi I've ever had!!! The service is fast, and the happy hour is insane! Totally recommend :)"}
{"text":"Best deals in Scottsdale for sushi!! Happy hour after 9 and you can get free miso soup and mochi by checking in with yelp! Best service ever!!"}
{"text":"Oh wwwoowwww. This place is good. REAL good. We stopped by for lunch on a Saturday and the place was pretty empty. A few of us tried to order some different flavored sakes but was told they were out...and they were out of the beer that someone else was going to order. After that - it was all uphill! The service was quick and friendly. The miso was rich and flavorful and the house salad was more than your basic \"romaine, teeny bit of shredded carrots, and dressing\" - it had a variety of lettuces, cabbages, etc... I shared an order of the checkerboard rolls, the cucumber pop sushi roll things, and some salmon(sake). Everything was SO fresh. The flavors were spot on - and they were rolled right. Nice and tight, with nothing falling out when you picked them up. I cannot wait to go back!"}
{"text":"Since I moved to Scottsdale from Tucson, Ive been trying to find a place that I could go to for sushi that wasnt called Ra.

My buddy and I went for the reverse happy hour and were able to try anything we wanted because of the affordable prices of the rolls. 

This place is awesome and the service is great and attentive. 

I would recommend this spot to anyone. They also have live music some nights."}
{"text":"Best kept sushi secret in Scottsdale. Great service and fair price! Reverse happy hour is the bomb!! 4-7 and 7-9pm"}
{"text":"Their sweet potato roll is hands down my favorite roll EVER! I'm not a vegetarian but wow!!! This place is amazing! Ive tried just about every other sushi restaurant in Scottsdale and by far this place is the best! Service and always immaculate, it's always clean, they play sports games on their tvs around the restaurant which I love, and the staff is always so friendly! This place is a must if you want grade A sushi and killer service!"}
{"text":"One of my favorite sushi places in town. Happy hour is great! Affordable and delicious every time. Could be a little cleaner though, so I'm deducting 1 star."}
{"text":"Solid!!

This is a pretty no frills place that isn't very fancy and for the most part could be a Denny's with Sushi but the Sushi is top notch. 

Really reasonable as well. Especially for happy hour.

Things I loved: vegas rolls, spicy tuna, unagi, stuffed mushrooms

Thing I probably wouldn't get again: gyoza, tootsie roll


I think I've found my new favorite happy hour sushi place"}
{"text":"My wife and I found Bei when we first moved into the valley. We've since tried other sushi spots, but never found one that fit with us as well as Bei. Bei has great food, great prices (especially at happy hour), and very friendly staff. I would definitely recommend this place to anyone that loves sushi and doesn't want to break the budget."}
{"text":"Really friendly and quick service! The food was tasty. Definitely come thru for happy hour, it's liiiiiiiiiiiit"}
{"text":"wow-phenomenal!!! gabe was such an incredible waiter, i am speechless and i feel like this video of lady gaga https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=vbk0p27qgmc i will never go anywhere else for sushi again"}
{"text":"Disappointed. Wanted this to work. Waiter couldn't explain the best things on the menu for a foodie, so probably should have left at that point. But pushed on... Miso soup was nearly inedible, overly salty. Bulgogi was Ok, not special."}
{"text":"I travel to Scottsdale frequently for work and I've had some decent sushi in the area but nothing has come close to Bei sushi. It's definitely comparable to some of the best places that I've been to in NYC. 

I'm going to give it 5 stars because the food and drinks we're amazing. However, the managers we're too much. They asked me how my food was and I hadn't even had to time take a bite. I can tell they are concerned being a new restaurant but come guys... it makes you look desperate and it seems like people in Scottsdale simply aren't into that. By the time I had my 2nd piece of sushi 3 people had asked me if \"everything was alright\".  What's up with the yelling at everyone when they come in? Please stop. 

Not sure if I'll return again next time I visit just because I felt a tad uncomfortable but I'll definitely consider it. The sojo drinks we're amazing too. I had two different versions of their Soju cocktails. Aloe and Yogurt. I saw other drinks on their menu and I must say, as a new yorker even, they know what they are doing at the bar. The bartender was also really funny and recommended some fun things to do in the area."}
{"text":"love this place it's a regular spot for my roommates and I. Service and food are always great, the late night happy hour is perfect!"}
{"text":"I am not a fan of sushi. So, I have no idea how good or bad their sushi is.

Their chashu ramen though, is to die for. Clearly, the broth is made in-house and it's the star of the dish. Again, I am no ramen expert but I am usually slurping away to glory until the last drop. I also like their ramen portion. It's just right. I always feel guilty leaving behind so much ramen at other places. Of course, I wouldn't box up ramen. Sacrilege!

Ask for their secret \"red spice powder\". Sprinkle (with caution) on top and slurp away!"}
{"text":"Server was great! Food was amazing! They have very good happy hour and lunch specials. Live music on Thursdays."}
{"text":"Staff was friendly and prompt upon arrival. They have a great happy hour menu. Miso Soup is delicious. Been a repeat customer for 2 years."}
{"text":"The sushi was great. I had two 16 year olds that are big eaters so naturally I was concerned. This is gonna be pricey, it wasnt!  We ordered a lot of rolls, admittedly..everything was delicious. Atmosphere not so much but it was Easter...so... 
It's great for when you need your sushi fix at a reasonable price."}
{"text":"Wowwwww! So impressed. Their salmon  lunch special is $13 but you get tempura veggies, California Roll, WonTon, a separate side salad , rice, mixed veggies and a generous portion of salmon!! I can't wait to go back for sushi! Service is VERY FAST as well."}
{"text":"This place has a great happy hour menu and reasonably priced. I would highly recommend their chicken teriyaki bowl."}
{"text":"Ella is one amazing server!!! Thanks for a great time!!! One amazing happy hour!!!! We will be back next Thursday!!!"}
{"text":"Bottom Line Up Front:  Bei is a delightful surprise!  Great quality, fresh fish, awesome happy hour!

FOOD:  4/5
I kept it original and ordered Sushi Nigiri for Salmon, Yellowtail, and Uni.  I also asked for fresh wasabi.  To share with the group, I also ordered the Spicy Ahi Tuna Poke Bowl.  The fish was very great quality especially the salmon.  The only downside was the Uni.  I would give it a 3/5 based on freshness but all the other fish and dishes made up for it.  The prices are very fair and again the quantity provided was amazing.  The Spicy Ahi Tuna Poke Bowl is not a true poke bowl in the sense that the fish were all shopped up.  It begs the question is they are using quality parts of the fish or if they are including scraps and chopping it up to hide this.  I hope the former.  In any case, it was very good with a healthy ratio of fish to rice.  It was nibbled on by three people and it was enough.  Be sure to check-in as we had two specials -- free miso soup and free edamame!

SERVICE: 5/5
I can't remember her name!  Monami? Monoma?  She was extremely attentive and constantly coming by to check on our water, orders, and just overall satisfaction -- all with a smile.  She definitely sets the model standard for service and I hope all the others are at least as good as her.  The food came out as ordered and with a reasonable amount of time.

AMBIANCE/DECOR:  3/5
It definitely is better than what you'd expect from its location and its view from the outside.  I felt a little more like I was in an art gallery with the super white LED lighting and spaciousness.  However, I am big on the quality and service categories and not so much on the ambiance/decor so this doesn't really play a huge factor.  For me it was ok.

PRICE:  5/5
We came during happy hour so many of the rolls came out to be a dollar less.  Overall, I paid for spicy tuna roll, spicy salmon roll, spicy ahi tuna poke bowl, uni nigiri, salmon nigiri, yellowtail nigiri, and two orders of fresh wasabi.  With Yelp's check-in, I was able to get free Miso Soups and free edamame.  My total bill came out to be around $55 less tip and tax.  Not bad at all!"}
{"text":"I have been coming here at least once a week since they opened last year. Bei is such an amazing addition to south Scottsdale. The owners, JT and June, are extremely welcoming and always smiling. The sushi is very fresh and of high quality. Bei has happy hour twice a day and the happy hour menu changes monthly which is something to look forward to each month. Try the Pure Roll - you won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"We were craving sushi and decided to order and pick up. 

Read the reviews above.  We did and were impressed. 

Sushi take out and delicious!"}
{"text":"Real good sashimi, sushi, and wraps! Delicious.  The service was fast and good.  Prices were reasonable.   Great location next to a gym.  Definitely recommendable!!!"}
{"text":"I would highly recommend Bei to anyone! Our server was Tikra, she was awesome, very knowledgeable of their menu and made some great recommendations! The best quality sushi I've experienced in Old Town with a great happy hour menu. We will be back!!"}
{"text":"Fresh, delicious, and service is amazing. I've come here a few times for happy hour and it's always above par. We've ordered the lollipop roll, salmon sashimi, volcano roll, and a few other bites. The lollipop is my favorite and go to roll. This place will not disappoint!"}
{"text":"This is one of the best places for sushi! We had great customer service and love the happy hour!"}
{"text":"Definitely liked this place after trying it for the first time the other day, I would definitely suggest going during their happy hour because their rolls are much cheaper, also their happy hour menu changes each month, so it's always something new!
I made sure I checked in to get the free miso soup...score! 
This place is surprisingly much bigger on the inside than I was expecting. They have somewhat of a segregated bar area, booths, and sushi bar seating. 

We ordered the Alaskan roll, the Nebraska roll, Philadelphia roll and spicy salmon roll. The only one I wasn't really pleased with was the Nebraska roll because I felt it was somewhat over seasoned and soggy. 
I really liked the fresh rolls though! The Philadelphia had big chunks of meat in each piece (unlike some restaurants I've experienced out in AZ).
The salmon was very fresh and we got a lot of it. 
I read about some of the 12-15 dollar rolls, they sound delicious! But I just can't bring myself to pay that. I am cheap. Hahahaa 

We did get to watch some drama unfold between a server and one of the new sushi chefs. So free entertainment while we ate. 

I'm definitely coming back though!"}
{"text":"Love this place! To start, it's great priced sushi! No $15-$20 rolls, everything is good and reasonable priced. Happy hour is where it's at. You will save on the already cheap rolls and be able to walk away with a huge amount of sushi in your belly for not a lot of money."}
{"text":"Service was great for happy hour but the sashimi did not taste that fresh. It might have been because I was starving, but I felt sick eating the sushi. I love sashimi, sushi but tonight's didn't taste good. The rolls were over stuff with rice and very little sushi. 

Carlee was actually a fantastic host tonight. Maybe she was having a bad night the other night per another reviewer."}
{"text":"Me and my girlfriend come here all the time for our late night sushi cravings. Sushi is delicious, good priced drinks as well. Killer happy our!"}
{"text":"Wanted to try a new sushi spot and stumbled on Bei. Everything from the vibe to the food was great! I had the egg rolls, the volcano roll, and golden Philly. Their version of the sushi was the best version of those I have had. I have found my new sushi place!"}
{"text":"Bei is one of my favorite sushi spots. Everything I have ordered is fresh and delicious. Best happy hour for sushi I have found!"}
{"text":"Excellent service and  great food. Had the jalapeño hamachi roll and the Scottsdale roll. Excellent.  The vegetable tempura was just okay. I will come back."}
{"text":"I went to Bei yesterday with the family after a failed attempt at going to Totties (that is sort of another story, but some people had been waiting there over an hour.. yikes!). Anyway, My dad, stepmom, husband, and I arrived here at around 12:45 and it was fairly empty. My dad and I split the noodle and rice bowl combo (this thing is huge... like 2 full entrees) with the spicy chicken noodles and the spicy pork bowl and . The husband had the beef teriyaki bowl and my stepmom got the tempura bento box. The gyoza was pretty standard... like the frozen type, not awesome. The salad had a fairly good ginger dressing on it, but too much of it... like a pool at the bottom. I thought the spicy chicken noodles were very tasty, just the right balance of sweet and spicy on thick noodles with vegetables and chicken. The spicy pork was even better, it was spicy and had the right amount of sauce to rice ratio... I liked both very much. The rest of the food was fairly mediocre. Anyway, I would consider going back for the items I ordered, but probably wouldn't get the other items."}
{"text":"This has been my go to sushi spot for a couple of years now. The happy hour goes through 7, which allows me catch it after work anyday. The HH menu is also great! I recommend trying out the gyoza."}
{"text":"Coming in, we were greeted and felt welcomed. The waiter wasn't very helpful in choosing our meal and giving us options. We started with eating the miso soup, unfortunately that was cold and salty. The sushi was alright, nothing special. And main course which consisted of thinly sliced beef was alright too. Nothing that would make me come back honestly. And the waiters seemed like they were in a hurry all the time."}
{"text":"Atmosphere is great!  Have been here a few times with my daughter and her boyfriend.  Sushi is the best in PHX!  Everyone is friendly and Happy Hour is the best!!"}
{"text":"Great service, but very cafeteria like decor and atmosphere, and the sushi itself was just ok. Pretty meh."}
{"text":"Okay sushi, not my fav, but not bad. Pricing is good for happy hour. They messed up my order. I ordered a spicy poke bowl and they gave me a spicy pork bowl...they did fix it. Good on refills and nice environment. Overall not sure if I would go back on purpose but I wouldn't avoid it."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I went here for the first time over this past weekend. It was great sushi and great service! The prices are fare, and the quality of the fish is good. The restaurant itself is small and casual. We shared a golden philly roll and I think it may have been the best sushi I've ever tried. We will definitely be coming back here again :)"}
{"text":"Highly recommend this restaurant! For Scottsdale the quality and pricing is superb. Service was excellent; food preparation and timeliness was as expected and we weren't left waiting long. 

The restaurant itself was clean and a friendly atmosphere. I like likely be a regular."}
{"text":"They have really good food. And customer service.  All their dishes are really good. I was very impressed with the dishes I ate. Definitely worth the trip."}
{"text":"Nice staff, clean resturant. 

Ordered the salmon teriyaki box lunch special. For 12 bucks including tax  it was a good deal."}
{"text":"Excellent service, delicious food, and fun atmosphere! Bei has one of the best happy hour menus I've ever seen and one of the longest happy hours. Most places only have happy hour until 5pm but they go all the way to 7pm! The quality of the sushi is great and they have options for everyone."}
{"text":"We have been to Bei twice now, and I have to say I hope this little sushi place stays around. The food has been really good on both visits, and I love that they offer a reverse happy hour, as my work schedule doesn't usually allow me to go to normal happy hour.
The tuna lovers roll is amazing. Probably my favorite roll I have ever had anywhere! The sashimi prices are a little higher than what I would normally pay at a sushi restaurant. That's my only issue with Bei. The food is great, but the location and decorating/ ambiance of the restaurant aren't the best. The bar area is really dark- yet the dining room is extremely bright. I wish they could dim the lights a little more to give it a better vibe. I don't mind paying higher prices for quality sushi, but not when it's in a run down strip mall with tacky decorating. But we will return! And I probably just sounded super bitchy! Go here! Just don't expect a romantic setting of any sort! 

Oh and they have a good selection of appetizers! Yum!"}
{"text":"Awesome spot. Great happy hour, vibes on point. Can't go wrong. Bartenders and staff are very courteous and attentive."}
{"text":"Good quality fish, very nice atmosphere, great service! First time here and I will definitely be coming back! They do a great job of plating the food to make it look super nice and tasty. I brought my Bae here to Bei and she loved it too. She thought the food was good and service was great. I'm sure some of her bae friends would love this place too. I may come here for some fish before heading out to the bay to catch my own. Be It as it may, I love mochi and the place is BEAutiful. I could see myself Be A regular at this restaurant. Also the water is very tasty! Yummy in my tummy!"}
{"text":"This is a great restaurant! The sushi is fresh, it has a comfortable vibe, and friendly staff! It's a must visit"}
{"text":"Happy hour is awesome! You won't find specialty rolls at a better price. Ella is a great server and super patient. I would highly advise utilizing the full bar. Will be back."}
{"text":"I was very impressed with Bei. The restaurant was clean and had comfy booths. They also have sushi bar but we were there to get other Japanese food. 

Spicy pork bowl from their combo lunch option was good size and had perfect portions of meat and vegetables. The chasu ramen had deep bone flavor and plenty of pork. However it was missing the traditional Japanese toppings such as the pickled vegetables. Other than that, it was really tasty and satisfying. Their combo meals really is enough for 2 people. 

Their traditional bento boxes were also very satisfying. The chicken katsu was fresh and hot and not greasy at all. 

Their hamachi Kama here was very affordable here at $8.95. It was moist and large enough to be eaten as a meal.  Their calamari appetizer which was prepared more like cutlets were also tasty. No tentacles here.  

Service was excellent and fast. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"The best udon noodles. I've been to Japan, and this place does an excellent job with presentation and preparation. Has a cool lounge vibe, excellent drink selection and its affordable. Trumps RA!"}
{"text":"I am very happy that we have a decent and reasonably priced sushi joint in Scottsdale as an alternative to some of the more expensive yet mediocre options in Old Town. Bei is in a very unimpressive strip mall, yet delivers some good eats in a humble setting (read: not much ambiance). I've had enough good and bad sushi to know that \"atmosphere\" rarely speaks to the quality of fish or talent of the sushi chef. And I like that this is much more laid back and casual than its neighbors to the north.

Happy Hour is definitely a bargain with a fairly large window from 4-7pm every day and 9pm to close. The sushi choices on discount are plentiful, though the beverage choices could stand a few more options. I like a good Kirin from time to time, but I really wish they had just one or two craft beer choices or perhaps a decent wine option. I do wish I could rave about the food as many 1-time visitors have, but I'm not quite there yet. 

The basic rolls and appetizers are done really well. The spicy tuna/salmon are delicious and we loved the calamari appetizer (though please come up with a better sauce than mayo). Basics are awesome, but I'm always looking for some creative specialty rolls that are decently priced and play on great flavors. The specialty roll selection here is a bit unimpressive. A significant portion of them include \"crab mix,\" \"spicy crab,\" or a California roll toped with \"xyz\" - which we all know is menu-speak for imitation fish + more mayo - and it tastes like it even with quality fish added into/on top of the rolls. The actual fish they serve is wonderful, but why serve so much of it with mock-fish? It's overpowering and distracts from what coule be some very delicious sushi.

The service was attentive and friendly from both the bar and table perspectives. I will definitely return to Bei and stick with the basic rolls and sashimi for as much Happy Hour love as I can, but I'm hopeful they'll peel away from a the overabundance of crab mix in favor of the lovely fish they serve."}
{"text":"Great sushi at an affordable price!

A go-to spot for happy hour! 

If you love saucey rolls, try the Checkerboard! It's delicious"}
{"text":"Great happy hour!! We split a beer and had a few rolls...great sushi for a great price!"}
{"text":"I hadn't been to Bei for quite some time, but decided to stop by the other day to satisfy my craving for sushi. I got there just in time to order from the lunch menu before the kitchen closed until dinner. (The restaurant closes each day at 2:30, and reopens at 4:30) 

It was just a few minutes past 2:00, but my server was helpful enough to let me know that it was last call for lunch orders, and when the kitchen closed, that was it, and she wanted to be sure I got in under the wire. 

I made a quick decision to have the Sushi Combo, which was miso soup, tuna, salmon, yellowtail and shrimp nigiri, and a California roll or Spicy Tuna roll - which looked like a good deal at $9.50. For my roll, I wanted to have a spicy tuna hand roll instead of the standard roll. The server said that was no problem. I also asked it she could be sure it was spicy, and she indicated again, no problem.

My miso soup arrived within moments. It was pretty basic, but met my needs. My sushi also arrived quickly. The fish tasted fresh, and even the shrimp, which I am not generally a big fan of, was good. My spicy tuna hand roll started off ok, although I could see, and taste with my first bite that siracha had been used to supply the heat. 

I don't have an objection to siracha, but in most spicy tuna I have historically had, the heat has been supplied by chili oil, which adds heat without the tuna flavor being drowned out as it was with the siracha in this case. 

By the time I got 1/2 way into my hand roll, all I could taste was siracha. I had to drizzle a bit of soy sauce with wasabi into the roll to offset the overwhelming siracha taste with a different and less sweet element.

I know the next time to request that siracha be kept to a minimum, and that chili oil be used for heat. I believe Bei will be able to accommodate that request.

On this visit, everything happened so fast that I was finished with my lunch in about 15 minutes. My server assured me that I could take my time, and that only the food order was time sensitive, but since I was finished, I requested my check anyway. It was a pretty quick lunch - in and out in 20 minutes! 

Still, I will be going back again soon. The service was great, and Bei is accommodating. I'll bet they can prepare me exactly the spicy tuna roll that I want!  Also, my prior meal with them was excellent.

For the money, my lunch was a great deal! Next time, the Sashimi Combo!"}
{"text":"Bei is our go to sush/asian place when we dont know where else to go. I have had the sushi, gyozo and the protein bowls. 

I actually do not prefer the miso soup here. It has an odd taste to it and also tastes kind of fishy which I dont really like.

The sushi is always a hit here. It is always fresh and they are always attentive about your needs. For example, my parents were in town and my mom cant eat sesame seeds and they remade her sushi right away with no fuss. 

The rice bowls are very good and a great option if you are not quite in the mood for sushi.

The service has always been good! I have never had any issue with service here after going here around a dozen times. They are always attentive and consistent. The food always comes out fast.

Just a solid sushi fusion joint!"}
{"text":"They have excellent customer service. The servers are super friendly and attentive. And their sushi is great, some of the best I have had in town. I will definitely come back to this place...especially during happy hour when they have pretty good deals."}
{"text":"Lunch menu is filling and ranges from 9-13 bucks.  Attentive server with refills and pleasant atmosphere.  I tried the lunch sushi combo but might opt for a rice bowl or teriyaki dish next time.  The sushi didn't sit that well but could've been either the fish quality or soy sauce, not sure."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I love sushi and having this place around the corner has been a blessing! It's not the most glamorous but what it lacks in looks it makes up for in quality and service. 
As I am not a seaweed person I always ask for soy paper and boy can they wrap it tightly! I know that's weird to gush about how they wrap it but it makes the difference when chopsticks can actually be useful. The staff are always so pleasant and make it a point to ensure you have everything you need. The monthly change to the happy hour food menu is nice because it forces you to try something new especially when on a budget. 
I'm usually a tough person to impress but this place has my wallet and taste buds wrapped in soy paper!"}
{"text":"Bei sushi is bae! I love this spot!  this is my go to sushi restaurant and the happy hour deals are great!  if you want good quality sushi in Arizona, you should checkbout Bei! Surprisingly the fish tasres very fresh and was delicious!"}
{"text":"We ordered delivery and got the \"Spicy Poke Bowl\" and the Spicy Seafood Noodles. 

There is no way what was served can be considered a poke bowl. I wish I had taken pictures but I was just so disgusted with what I got I had to throw it away. It's basically the same chopped up fish that they would put in a spicy tuna / spicy salmon roll. Poke bowls are supposed to be made with fresh cubed fish. The seafood noodles were just as bad. They were sickeningly sweet. As if someone had dumped a bunch of duck sauce in there. And the seafood was icky. Didn't taste fresh at all. After trying a couple of bites we just didn't feel right. Will never ever eat here again."}
{"text":"Came here with the works girlss for my first time, bombbbb sushiii! Just moved here 4 months ago and Ive now found my fav sushi spot!! Happy hr menu is good too! Deff commin back again soon!"}
{"text":"This place is simply fantastic.  The sushi is excellent, service is top notch, and I would recommend it to anyone looking for good food in the Scottsdale area.  

We had numerous items including nearly all of the sashimi, both of their signature rolls, and some sampling a of nigiri.  In addition, the staff allowed us a few samples of other things including a dessert rice pudding that is to die for.  

It's still early in the day, and what a great time to come in, no one is here so u get special attention!

Can't say enough good things about this little joint and if I'm back in Phoenix, it will be a stop.  Come in, have some sushi, and sit at the bar if u can, current bartender is a good conversationalist and pretty easy on the eyes."}
{"text":"I love Bei. 

It's a friendly neighborhood bar and sushi restaurant, and the owners/staff will make your experience a great one. They are fun, friendly and will encourage you to join in on some late night karaoke as well as give you recommendations of their favorite options on the menu.

They have every kind of seating imaginable (I love having those options), TVs (and will change the channel if you ask nicely), live music (on the weekends) and Happy Hour specials! My boyfriend and I ordered a bottle of sake there, and it came in a really cool ice bucket which made us happy.

Get the stuffed mushrooms and thank me later. Oh yeah, and for Vegans they have Vegan options! : )

Head over to Bei, and have a good time. You won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Bei has always been a favorite of mine for two years now, they are always friendly with prompt service and tasty sushi is always served speedily"}
{"text":"This is my favorite sushi bar in town! I especially like their lunch special and tempura rolls. Will be going back soon. My favorite vegetarian roll is the zucchini roll. Also, don't forget the sweet potato one!"}
{"text":"Looking for good Japanese food, sashimi that is fresh and tasteful but not overpriced, this is the place. I mainly come here alone just to stop in, Grab dinner and move on (single man life), the staff is friendly and fast!"}

{"text":"If you want amazing sushi at cheap prices this is the place to go. The best happy hour ever. If you can get tikra as your server, do it!!"}
{"text":"Me and my roommates were craving sushi and Bei was just down the street from us. Sushi was just ok, nothing great. Service was ridiculously slow. As soon as we walked in, two employees looked directly at us and then continued to talk amongst themselves. We stood there for about a minute before one of them greeted and sat us down. The restaurant was far from busy, but our server seemed to be MIA most of the time. We're pretty sure she forgot to put in one of our orders and since there was only one chef that night, we ended up asking for a box as we needed to get going. Because of the slow service, they offered us free mochi ice cream, but that still took 15+ min just to get. Would not come back here again."}
{"text":"Pretty nice place.  

Ordered:
Edamame - excellent
Tootsie roll - average
Philly roll - good
Miso soup - good

As far as the sushi, I prefer Sake Bomber over on Broadway.  But this place had a very engaging bartender.  Unfortunately they close mid day for two hours, so we were rushed.  Make sure you have plenty of time to eat if you go for lunch."}
{"text":"I love it here! The sushi is always so delicious and the happy hour keeps me coming back! Really relaxed and laid back location. My favorite in Scottsdale!"}
{"text":"I have been at this restaurant since it opened and their food has always been delicious! Great lunch specials, everything is good but specifically the Salmon combo- it is so tasty and it's a huge portion. The owners are always very nice and give great costumer service. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"Pretty good. Wasn't spectacular but I'd return if others wanted to go. Inside looks better than the outside of the building does."}
{"text":"The ramen was simple but delicious. They gave quite a lot of meat. The Hawaiian sushi roll was pretty good. Their miso soup is a little bit on the saltier side. I like how when they offer a free mochi ice cream when you review them on yelp. The mochi was really hard and had a very thick outer layer. Usually mochi is very soft and has a chewy layer. The ice cream also did not taste like green tea. I would not suggest getting the mochi ice cream if you are actually going to spend $4.95 on it."}
{"text":"I love this family owned Sushi place. They take pride in their work. The sashimi is always fresh and melts in your mouth. The staff is knowledgeable and friendly. They carry a food complimentary Sake selection. Twice a month on Thursday's at 6pm they have live Jazz music; enhancing the experience. I highly suggest this place!"}
{"text":"We came here for happy hour, sake bomb was a large Kirin which was a great deal. The Las Vegas rolls are great as well as the spider roll which is not on the happy hour menu. We ordered the green tea cheesecake as dessert and it was a frozen consistency but was a large serving, still good despite not having a crust (light green tea taste). The staff was super attentive but a little pushy. We will be coming back for sure for the free miso soup"}
{"text":"First,  let me confirm that this establishment has not 1, but 2 restrooms.   One for ladies and one for men.   A fellow Yelper and I exchanged messages about this before I went because that Yelper's review states that Bei does not have a restroom for customers.  It does.   The sign out front is for non-customers.  I snapped a pic of the restroom sign as evidence for others reading reviews and considering this establishment----- because I almost bypassed this restaurant because of that Yelper's information. I hope this helps.

Lately,  I have been into Ramen and brothy soups in general.   Miso, shrimp and pork ramen to be specific.   Take a look at the picture of my Ramen http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/bei-scottsdale-2?selected=ovAcABgI3P5BFBUiBYQ9KA#xSczojjTQAVoXmEqcY19yw and view the pic of the Ramen posted by Yelper Britt C.  http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/bei-scottsdale-2?selected=ovAcABgI3P5BFBUiBYQ9KA#Gx2-zZuvY5ynZbUD27BlpA  They look quite different.   Mine had a few tiny pieces of meat, a limited amount of veggies and lacked adequate broth.   I hated it!  I can honestly say the 25 cent pack of ramen I made in college was better!  The veggies tasted canned. I expected a nice piece of pork in the Ramen like the aforementioned picture by Britt C, but there were only a few flavorless tiny pieces. A well known improvisational restaurant, that has monthly ramen nights, down the street has ruined my palate to tolerate ramen any place else.   I can not say how much I hated that dish!   

I ordered a spicy sushi roll that I split with a fellow Yelper.  Decent roll.  I would like to try the Bei roll one day. 

I went here with the international lunch group that I organize.   Everyone else ordered a bento lunch box.  They were all happy with their lunch and had a consensus 3 star meal.

There were 6 of us,  we were automatically charged a 20% gratuity.   I don't know if this is normal for everyone or if that is the case for groups.   It was not printed on the menu.   It aggravated me,  but alas wasn't a big deal.   They should print that on their menu.

2 stars - I hated my dish.

Because the location is cool for me for easy access to sushi in SoScott, but considering the proximity of other sushi restos that I like better:
Return Factor: 15%,

{"text":"One of the best sushi places in the area. Really tasty! I have only tried sushi that was part or fully cooked though, so I can't speak for the raw stuff. Nice atmosphere and the service was great."}
