{"text":"To be fair the service was good and the food just O.K. but just like everyone else mentioned the smell of the place was too much! It's smells like a dirty bathroom that was just sprayed with a very strong air freshener. Also, beware of coming after hours if you don't feel like being serenaded by very loud karaoke."}
{"text":"For the price it is good, compare to other Phos it is considered top of the chart. But need to improve on serving size for the rice with meat dishes. The dip sauce is excellent."}
{"text":"This place is awesome!  Food is always on point, atmosphere is classic, and the owner is super friendly. He is always there to greet you and make sure your well taken care of! Highly recommend!!!"}
{"text":"First off all,  I am a pho restaurant junkie. On average I have it at least 2 to 3 times a week. Before, Pho Cao, opened up I had bounced around through a bunch of different places,  but now I have my regular spot!  
My pho of choice is normally the lean steak or chicken.  They are equally delightful. Lately though,  I have ventured out and tried the, shrimp pho with steak added, which I would highly recommend for a surf and turf style.  I have also tried the bun and fried rice.  Everything is great and reasonably priced! 
If you haven't already tried this place you need to.  The service is very hospital and the owner is a delight,  thanks Victor!"}
{"text":"review for yelp- Pho Cao

dropping people off for a red eye flight to boston, i'd rather stay overnight in phoenix before driving home to tucson. so i went looking for an interesting restaurant. i found one in Pho Cao. just north of the university, in a bit of an odd building, well signed and easy to find. very nice inside, movable table/booth which is a big plus.

attractive decor, very nice service, our's was with matthew. each got something different. i had chicken curry, alma had chicken pho and jamie had noodles. we shared a fried sweet potatoes. presentation was really impressive, fresh mint, cut chili and key limes. big bowl of pho, lots of noodles, curry was excellent and perfectly spiced.

well recommended. nice place, glad we found it."}
{"text":"Have been here for lunch twice. The food is awesome and the price is right. The bar looks very well stocked, seems like it would be a pretty happening place for happy hour if the location wasn't so sketchy. Really looks like someplace you'd get stabbed from the outside but it's actually really nice on the inside. Worth the stop."}
{"text":"Prices are high for pho but if you eat during happy hour, with bogo 1/2 off app and $1 off pho bowls, it's a bit more reasonable.  Our waitress didn't give us the discount till we asked for it.

I had the Pho Cao special bowl P1.  Broth was okay but didn't taste like it had been simmering all day.  The noddles were slightly over cooked.  We also had the soft spring rolls and the spicy wings.  The wings were not crispy and cook just poured buffalo sauce over wings on plate creating a soup rather than tossing them playing.  Spring rolls were delicious.  
Service was fine.  Other than male wait staff placing our orders on edge of table then walking away without eye contact, and female server not providing discount before being asked, Service was prompt and courteous.  I would come back when in mood for pho."}
{"text":"No a bad place to eat.  Came in after a long day of car shopping and the service was good and food was fast  and priced right  so I will def be back"}
{"text":"This is my go to spot for vietnamese food! Not only do they have what I would consider to be the best pho in the Phx area, but they have an incredibly friendly staff & excellent customer service(our servers name was Daniel, who was willing to answer all our questions on the menu)
I have tried both the traditional pho (#13) and the pho with rare stake & meatballs, and both are delicious. 
If you aren't in the mood for hot soup, they have a full menu with my personal favorite being the chicken curry. Like nothing I've ever tasted before. 
A fun atmosphere with good people. Victor & Holly are great people, with a wonderful local business! They even have fun events such as blues night & karaoke. 
Will continue to be a pho cao regular!"}
{"text":"I love the food. Their pho and Thai tea were yummy. I came back many times. Sometimes it is very loud, so expect to deal with that."}
{"text":"Will not be returning due to flavorless food. We used the sauces on the table and still tasted bland. The noodles seemed reheated and stale. Not an enjoyable experience."}
{"text":"NOTE: I came here for the pho, not the happy hour beer or bar food.

This is quite possibly the worst pho I've had in a long time. It was bland and the hoisen and siracha did not help. I ordered a salty plum drink and it came 30-45 min later, after asking about it 3 times so obviously I was a little pissed at the service. Also, I've never had a red berry flavored salty plum drink. The server was not knowledgeable about the menu at all and even forgot the side of rice my friend ordered, but was still charged for it. To top things off, the pho was expensive. 

I'd say the best part of the meal was the spicy chicken wings, which was the first thing we got and went down hill from there.

So we ordered chicken wings, summer rolls, 2 bowls of pho, 2 drinks and stir fry noodles with a side of rice = $60 including the automatic 18% gratuity from  the Living Social coupon. There a ton of other pho places in Phx where the same amount of food would cost $30-40. If you just wanna go for happy hour and/or some late night pho, be my guest!"}
{"text":"Bate and switch from their menu online to the menu in the restaurant.  Pho was alright, server was nice but the place is a horrible dive.  Owner is a douche"}
{"text":"The pho was amazing and the pork spring rolls are out of this world (so is the peanut sauce for them!). The pho broth was light and silky yet exploding with flavor. Excellent place for lunch."}
{"text":"I stopped by last night for the first Bluesday night jam and I had a blast. The atmosphere was great and the blues jam was amazing. I cannot speak for the food as I just stopped by on my way home to hear the blues, however, the staff was friendly and attentive.  I will be back next Tuesday for food and the jam!"}
{"text":"Pho is a terrific place,  great place to party and food is very good and fresh, plus great staff.  It's a perfect blend of tempe and scottsdale crowd. Very Good!"}
{"text":"Not only great food but our server Edwin was funny and showed us a great time! I definitely am coming back with the guys again!"}
{"text":"Food was tasty (a bit too oily, but ok), service was good, prices were fair, but overall nothing memorable. Not a 5-star place...and a few of the 5 star reviews seem like they are planted."}
{"text":"Came here at 11pm on a Friday night after work for some pho, and was greeted at the door with $5 cover charge??!!! Can't really review on the food because I sure wasn't going to pay $5 just to be able to sit down to eat and then pay another $7 for the actual meal."}
{"text":"Awesome pho ! But music was just a little bit too loud, was hard to have a conversation with my boyfriend,"}
{"text":"This is the best Pho in Scottsdale hands down!  I love the spicy tamarind option as no one makes their broth spicy enough.  We are repeat customers and will continue to do so."}
{"text":"It's ok. New place still trying to figure it out. First time we came here I ordered the fried rice. It was horrible. Came out cold and greasy. Second time I ordered the Steak Pho. It just left this weird taste in my mouth but was good. Music was way too loud though. It seems popular though on certain nights. Parking lot is packed. I'll probably come back but not sure about it yet."}
{"text":"The people here are wonderful & helpful! It's a great location for me to get something really good at decent prices & they were quick(only 10mins). I really don't know Vietnamese food well, but the large Pho Chin did me well. WAY bigger than expected, all the fixin's separated (I ordered to-go) and that way I made it all to taste. I'd much rather do that than be surprised by too much or too little of something. The potstickers are huge & delicious. I can't wait until the next time. I'm gonna eat in & have a few drinks & sample an entree next! YAY! 
(btw-not all good things are \"planted\". I just think this place is great &I'm glad it's finally a business that's in that location & doing well)     ;)"}
{"text":"Yes, the place is a little odd, and from reading the reviews I can see where the place has a little bit of an identity crisis, but I thoroughly enjoyed my experience. Let me be clear though - I went to see a band, not for the pho, so take that into consideration as you read this review. 

I got there about 30 minutes before the first band, and even though I went in through the wrong entrance (I went in through the door the bands load and unload) I got greeted and seated immediately. Service throughout the evening was just fine. I never had to wait around for anyone to show up with another drink, the guy was always around. Food was good. I've had better Vietnamese food in the valley, but have no complaints about the food served here.

I can understand someone coming specifically for Vietnamese fare and being put off by the divey sports-bar vibe at lunch time, or rolling in later at night to find a loud band up on stage, or drunk karaoke fans howling away. But for me, looking at it as a venue for live music, I think it was great. The place has a nice setup for live music and the bands sounded good. I got to sit at a table, get well taken care of by my waiter, eat decent pho, have some beers, and watch some great bands playing original music. 

I'm definitely going back."}
{"text":"\"Don't judge a book by its cover!\" This place was actually pretty good. We weren't too sure how it would be just because the place looked practically empty. But the pho was awesome! I will definitely be coming back!"}
{"text":"Nothing is good here.  Came in for lunch and was very disappointed.  No napkins on the table, no plates with our appetizer.  Paid for food we hardly touched. The flavor was off and the spring rolls were stuffed with iceberg lettuce.  The location is great but good Veitnamese food can be found elsewhere and will be worth the drive."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I went here for lunch with an Entertainment Book mobile coupon. This was my first Vietnamese food.

The  Com Chien Dac Biet (Cao's Special Fried Rice) was lightly seasoned and good. (Although my boyfriend thought it was a bit skimpy on the meat.) He had a vegetarian dish which was quite yummy.

I would give this place 4 stars, except they gave us a hassle regarding the coupon. After speaking with \"the owner's wife\", the server stated flatly that the coupon was only good on Pho. He continued this stance, even after I politely pointed out the coupon explicitly stated, \"Buy ANY menu item and get one menu item free, up to $7 off.\" I politely asked twice to speak to the manager. My boyfriend pointed out to the manager the BOGO was good on any menu item with a max value of $7. She called her husband. Finally, they accepted the coupon.

We never would have known about the restaurant without the deal. We were their only customers on a Saturday afternoon, (so maybe they should be nice to customers). We use the book regularly, and never get hassled. Also, the \"manager\" should be allowed to make a $7 decision.

It was good enough food and fair prices; so we will probably go back."}
{"text":"Went to this place for the first time last night. The food was freaking OUTSTANDING.

Came here to write a review and was completely baffled by some of the other extremely poor reviews...

I will say that I know that this restaurant just recently moved from another location, and I have to wonder if the chaos that that sort of event can create in a business was responsible for some of the other reviewers' poor experiences?

The decor is a bit strange, I will give it that. It's a bit pool hall, a bit dive bar, a bit karaoke bar... Not really a place that, just LOOKING at it, you would think would have great food.

I went in with a friend (fellow foodie) who'd been and was a fan. We grabbed seats at the bar and were immediately served by Victor, the owner.

Victor is funny and personable, and clearly has a quirky personality. After meeting and speaking with him, I think the atmosphere is really just a reflection of who he is. He is quick to laugh, loves karaoke, and is passionate about creating quality food (we had a 5 minute discussion about his selection of high-quality rice, preparation methods for it, etc.).

MY experience was probably the tastiest Vietnamese food I have ever had. I will definitely be a repeat customer and can't wait to try more of the menu.

Last night I had the Spicy Spring Rolls (BBQ pork, rice paper wrapper, Sriracha & Peanut sauce), Tom Chien Gion (Fire-Cracker Shrimp - coconut-crusted, deep fried shrimp with sweet & sour sauce), and Com Bo Luc Lac (Shaken Beef). Everything was perfection. And the beef was juicy, tender and flavorful.

Service was impeccable...

If you love good food, and a venue with a personality, do NOT skip this place due to a few bad reviews. If you're worried, find Victor. He will be sure to take care of you."}
{"text":"My favorite pho sho. Awesome atmosphere, cheap drinks, all my favorite local bands... Just a great place."}
{"text":"This place has a weird stinky smell. I'm vietnamese n know about real viet food, this place don't even have the nice soup smell that other restaurant have. They are lucky if people go to there restaurant and give them business. Business was slow there, that could be why they charge a fee if one doesn't order $10 or more... I have never heard of places charging a fee cuz the bill's total was not over $10 and this was cash transaction. so instead i cancel my order because there a much taster pho restaurant nearby that doesn't charge a fee."}
{"text":"#1: The managements crying child literally dripping snot on the floor, uncared for. #2: A server who could not remember our 2 item order. Asked again what our order was and still got it wrong. #3: Vegetarian egg rolls came filled with PORK. The management came out and picked up our food with bare hands, then left without a word. Hid in the kitchen. We left as soon as possible.....NEVER to return!"}
{"text":"Eh. Average pho grub. Hipster-ish waiter/aura. Pretty empty on a Saturday night.
The service was not bad, just slow and lack luster. The waiter was nice but not very attentive since he was also setting up for karaoke. They were out of Thai tea and took long enough for me to contemplate going I  the back and making it myself.


When we initially walked in no one acknowledge us. We asked the the bartender if we should seat our selves and she said \"Oh, yeah.\" 

Guess that's what I mean by hipster vibe, not just the fashion but the blasé attitude.
Nothing to come back for."}
{"text":"I'd only go back to this place if I were in the neighborhood and it was the nearest Pho location. It's not quite the Pho I crave.
The Pho was tasty but the portion was small. The combination didn't have all the combination meats that I expected it to have. 
I also had a taste of the Vermicelli noodles with pork. It was a small bowl jam packed with vegetables. Very very small handful of meat. You can get more meat in your vermicelli noodles elsewhere. The fish sauce was really sweet even when I added chili sauce it didn't quite taste right. And the bowl came with one roll of eggroll. Most other places give two rolls."}
{"text":"This place is amazing! Super delicious and fantastic price for the amount of food you get! We recommend this to everyone!"}
{"text":"I'm Vietnamese so I've had a lot of experience with Vietnamese food. Been to pho Cao 2 times. The service here is very bad. Bot times I went with a couple buddies and there were maybe 10 ppl in the whole restaurant. It took about 30 mins to get our app, which was the nem cuon..it was so so nothing special, the one at com tam thuan kieu at Mekong plaza is probably the best in town. Then we ordered our pho, it was bland! I can smell the anise (way too much of it) but that's about it. I couldn't even taste the beef of the broth. I tried to fix it by adding more hoisin than I normally add and siracha, but no luck.  I then had to ask for fish sauce to give it some flavor. Now its more edible. It's pretty bad if I have to add fish sauce to my pho. Oh, I also had to ask for napkins, the waiter brought our food but no napkins....twice! One time for the app and then for the pho. I've also had the shaken beef there the first time visiting and the flavor is good, only complain with that is they cut the beef too small. Shaken beef should be about 1 inch cubes bite sized, so u get a beefier bite each time. And lastly, they have karaoke! That's great! But it's a Vietnamese restaurant, yet they don't have any Vietnamese karaoke. Only English karaoke. I find that very ironic."}
{"text":"I can't tell you how the food is because I didn't even get that far. The waiter came over with our menus and place mats. He dropped a place mat on the floor, stepped on it, then picked it up and put it on the table in front of my fiance. I asked him to please get us a new one and clean the table off for us and he gave an aloof apology. He came back with fresh place mats, which he tucked under his armpit as he wiped our table with a rag, using no cleaning solution (and who knows where the rag had been). He put our now-wrinkled place mats down in front of us and asked what we wanted to drink. We left about 2 minutes later never to return."}
{"text":"One star is giving them WAY too much credit. DO NOT GO HERE!!! There are so many other great pho restaurants in Tempe and Scottsdale to have to settle for the terrible service at Pho Cao. They are not worth your precious, hard earned money!!! I ordered a bowl of pho, and after my first bite my throat and lips began to burn and go numb. I took another bite to make sure I wasn't going crazy and sure enough I was having an allergic reaction to the soup. I asked our waitress if they poured a ton of chili oil or something in the soup to make me have this allergic reaction and she said that their was no spice added. I asked her if I could have something else since I obviously was not going to be able to eat something that was making my throat and lips go numb. She \"checked\" with her manager and they said that they would not replace it since it's my fault for ordering it. Her manager told her that a jalapeño seed was causing my reaction even though the jalapeño was clearly on plate and not in my soup - nor did any jalapeño seeds get even remotely close to my soup. I showed her that the jalapeño and seeds were not in my soup and she said, \"sorry there's nothing we can do.\" I have never been to a restaurant with such poor service in my entire life. I am so disappointed that I had to waste my hard earned money and time at this terrible restaurant. 

SERVICE MATTERS! PLEASE GO ELSEWHERE!!!"}
{"text":"So happy to have a Pho place open late and nearby!  Beautiful, relaxing interior -- which is pretty unique among Vietnamese restaurants.  The vegetable pho really does come with lots of veggies; not just basil and bean sprouts.  There are a number of non-pho items on the menu that I look forward to trying.  Quick and friendly service, and some decent beers on tap.  Although it would be great to see a tap for Hop Knot or Stone added.  And very decently priced.  Thanks for opening!"}
{"text":"I stopped by for lunch for job I worked nearby. 

First of all, the service was impeccable---I was in a bit of a time crunch, so I informed the hostess and both she and my waiter were prompt and made sure I was done by the time requested. Additionally, I asked for Boba and, despite it not being on the menu, the kitchen prepared a cup. They didn't have the wide straws, but I was nevertheless impressed by their willingness to accommodate me. 

The Pho itself is the reason I chose not to give five stars. It's flavor was above average: The broth was rich and robust. The noodles appear to have sat dry for a few minutes too many, as they were clumped together. I attribute it to the lack of a much rush, so it isn't a fatal flaw. 

All in all, Pho Cao exceeded expectations for a nightclub-esque noodle shop. I'll be back for more Pho and the puns that came with it."}
{"text":"The pho was phabulous!!  We had a great meal at this new and wonderful restaurant... Go check it out and I know you will love the food and the owner, Victor, who really made sure we had a great experience."}
{"text":"GREAT PHO!!!! friendly staff easy parking"}
{"text":"What a disappointment.

The owner has really lost touch with his community.  

So many good folks have reached out. After many attempts, this place is completely  unresponsive to everyone and everything.  

Our community in scottsdale would normally help a business like this thrive.   With kind and supportive assistance from the locals, Pho Cao could be a happening business full of arts, entertainment, and many happy folks returning for more and more fun.  

They refuse to have an open mind or open heart for parties, local gatherings, and community functions. 

Pho Cao.  You need to remember. 1 person is not the community.  The community however, speaks, via select people.  

Shame on you."}
{"text":"I have been here twice, so far, and each time was impressed.  The first time, I was craving noodles, and got there after hours when the kitchen had closed and they had only Pho left on the menu.  The owner went back and cooked me noodles anyway, which were spectacular.  The next time I went, I tried some Pho with Sriracha sauce in it.  Absolutely delicious.  Was not hip to nor expecting the music they apparently have there, but will return anytime for the food and would recommend it to anyone who asks."}
{"text":"I have gone here a couple of times for lunch, and I tried this place for a late dinner on a Saturday night. I think the experience is a 3 but the food is a 4. 

The good: the pho and the goi cuon (spring and \"summer\" rolls) are pretty legit. Despite the higher prices (what do you expect in Scottsdale), the flavor is on point. The service is fast and I like that there is an option to have beer with my Vietnamese food (because Heineken makes the experience, people).

The meh: Weekend nights are strange here. We showed up at around 8 or so. There were 3-4 different cover bands singing karaoke-grade covers, and all 55+ as far as age. That's not a bad thing, it just wasn't the scene I was hoping for. It was, however, really obvious they need a sound guy. The feedback on the speakers was miserable and ongoing. Not pleasant for a dining experience. 

I would like to go back again (and this is 100x better than Noodles Ranch up the street) but I'll try again on karaoke night to see how the vibe is."}
{"text":"My go to Pho' house.Been going here for about 2 years.Best Pho I've tried in Phoenix,great service."}
{"text":"Place is just a dive surprisingly how good it looks on the outside. Pretty dark and grungy indoors. Food is just ok, could have more flavor. Curry seemed like it was watered down. Service is mediocre. There is definitely better Pho around Scottsdale to go after."}
{"text":"Not authentic Vietnamese food.  The taste and the food is more for American people.  And they are pricey too.  Pho didn't tastes very exciting but the fish sauce chicken wings were good.  They were a little spicy but we could handle it."}
{"text":"Awesome food, great atmosphere and unbelievable happy hour prices. They also serve fresh boba tea. I just found my new favorite hang out."}
{"text":"Good...for Arizona. Moving from NYC I was looking for a great pho/bahn mi place. This is the best for the area, but let's be honest, that ain't saying much. Weird place, weird vibe, but certainly decent enough food to satisfy any cravings for vietnamese cuisine you may have."}
{"text":"Great pho and live music Friday and Saturday. Definitely coming back!"}
{"text":"Nice place with decent Asian food. Pho Cao is mainly a bar that also serves food. Good staff that seems to care about their patrons.

Wish they'd cut back on the garlic and use better quality chicken parts (i.e. Only use chicken breasts)."}
{"text":"The food is amazing.  I had the pho and my friend had a plate of rice noodles with beef and veggies.  Both dishes were great.  And they use fresh ingredients which is what I loved most about it.  As good as the food was the happy hour drink prices were even better.  This is definitely my new fav restaurant bar."}
{"text":"I would have given them a 2 stars but the waiter was kind and I came to this place once before when I Was out of town in January and it was delicious. This time I came and the vermicelli I ordered the lettuce and bean sprouts were wilted and brown. I still eat, because service took forever and I Was starving from traveling. But I kindly notified the waiter to notify the chef. I do not know if I come back again if I'm in Scottsdale..."}
{"text":"This place has the best fried rice, egg rolls, pot stickers.  I'm half Filipino and have had my share of these types of dishes.  I tried the Pho for the first time here and found it very tasty, however I was not told about the different sauces you can add, and kinda went over board. I plan to try some of the variety of Pho they have to offer.  

Be sure to stick around every Wednesday, Thursday and most Friday's for the Karaoke, the song list is the best, the hosts are a lot of fun, and they even play some of the most current songs in between singers.

The staff, makes it a fun place to eat, drink and be entertained, thanks Matt, Nick, Jason, Ben, Linda, Terry, all the kitchen personnel and of course Victor the owner."}
{"text":"I moved so I haven't been there recently. I heard they recently moved too. I'm planning a trip out there soon because I miss their pho thai bowls, Bánh mì sandwiches, and thai teas. Can't wait!

UPDATE: I went there on Friday 5/5/17 and had a very disappointing and negative experience. My roomate and I were in the area. So, we stopped by for an early dinner around 5pm. The place was completely empty. We walk in and sit ourselves in a booth. After a few minutes, a waitress comes out and comes by to our table to take our orders. We both order two Thai iced teas and some appetizers: fried calamari, and an order or spring rolls, which we shared. The calamari were very different than I'm used to at any other restaurant. But, not bad. The disappointing and strange part is that they were served with a side of shrimp cocktail sauce  (unoriginal). We were both starving at that point, so we both scarfed down the appetizers and waited for our dinner entrees. I ordered a bowl of Pho soup (regular size #6) and my roomate ordered a chicken curry dish.  I guess I should have paid attention that my pho was not steaming hot as it normally is served. But, like I said before, we were starving. Right after our dinner we both started to feel overly full. Which is somewhat normal after eating a bowl of pho. But the strange part is that after we got home, I noticed that my stomach felt upset even 4 hrs after. I took some Pepto to soothe my stomach upset. A little while later, I would spend the rest of the night and part of the next morning vomiting the entire contents of my stomach. Which was everything I had for dinner. I had a bad case of food poisoning!  I had not felt that sick and horrible after eating anywhere in years. As far as I can recall, I had only had food poisoning once before. And the symptoms were pretty similar. Either the cook or the kitchen is operating under unhealthy sanitary conditions, or the soup was not cooked to proper temperature to prevent someone from getting sick.  Either way,  I can no longer recommend this restaurant to anyone. Sad. Because I had been there several times before without incident. 

BEWARE: If you have the pho soup here, make sure it's piping hot! And still, eat at your own risk. Sorry Victor. Maybe it is just the cook. Either way, heads up on checking that the kitchen is operating to proper food handling/preparation standards. I'm sorry I had to give you a bad review.  I just don't want anyone else getting as sick as I did."}
{"text":"Very good Vietnamese restaurant with a good Pho selection menu. Prices are very reasonable and if you like them on FB, You'll learn the $5 specials they post every so often. 
Only thing I would suggest is that they make the Spring rolls (Goi cuon) just a tad bigger. But, they usually do their best to get you substitutions (if requested nicely).

I don't have tolerance for suffering through the torture of listening to people who sound like sheep being slaughtered, so I avoid \"karaoke time\". But if you do, knock yourself out! ;-)

Fyi, Victor is the owner and manager here. He is friendly, helpful, and VERY serious about his business. He is always trying to make sure service is good. 
I get the feeling some of these other \"posters\" just wanted to bad mouth this restaurant to be petty, more than anything. SMH"}
{"text":"So there *I* was...

Trying to get lunch with a couple of friends, a lunch that would never happen. We drove up to find a rugged looking parking lot with signs barring customers from drinking liquor in the parking lot and jäger bottles in the windows, that should've been the first red flag. But we got out the car and saw a woman who said she was the health inspector who was here to inspect the place. We laughed and made jokes but still walked in. 

We were greeted by a waiter who seemed to be the only person working and there was only one other table filled in the entire place. We ordered a sandwich, pho, lemongrass chicken & spring rolls. We were never asked for our drink order... Kinda odd move for a bar that happens to serve food. We were nibbling on our spring rolls as we saw the health inspector announce herself and head into the kitchen. Nearly a half hour later we were only served my sandwich and the rest was still coming. We waited some more time and wanted to pay for the sandwich and leave; when the owner came and bagged my sandwich and handed it to me. 

We were bewildered and after asking some questions, it turned out their health inspection didn't go so well and they were getting shut down. The inspector didn't even let them make our lunch! I can't say how the sandwich because I didn't exactly feel like eating it. My friend who ate the lion-share of the shrimp spring rolls said they were okay except the lettuce and cabbage was old and browning and the shrimp tasted of cardboard. I'm writing this at the end of the day and happily, I can report that none of us experienced any tummy troubles from the compromised food. 

To my Yelpers I say: I can't even tell you to skip this place because they got shut the hell DOWN!!"}
{"text":"The worst service I have ever had when I went to this place today. Previously had great experiences today was hell. Blake was my waiter and I pray for the customers he has after me today. Asked for hot tea. Brought tea mug and brought it over so carelessly there was hot water all over the plate. It dumped down my leg. After that the refill was the same way. Asked about spring rolls said I don't eat pork. He recommended the first one with pork. Then repeated I don't eat pork recommended the only other one on there with pork in it so settled on the spider ones and made my own non pork decision. Brought out 2 entrees to the customers I was with. Mine never came out. Double checked what was going on assured it was on the way. My pho never came. Walked over to kitchen after long wait and asked him to box it to go with noodles separate and all components separate . Noodles in my broth and all the meat. Asked and paid for extra meat, got 2 extra prices of shrimp no extra meat. Majority of ingredients not on side so noodles Super soggy and gross by the time I got home to eat. Icing on the cake the bill was $68.50 I gave him $100 he brought me back 30$ while explaining and I quote \" I couldn't find another 1.50$ so here is 30 back sorry about that. I left no tip and will not return. Worst waiter and service ever. Worst to go ever."}
{"text":"Love this place. The staff is great, food is amazing, and the price is reasonable. Win win win"}
{"text":"We went to see why it was always packed in the parking lot, and come to find out its because the food is great and the service was amazing. We went and heard live music with our kids, they really enjoyed it. Our server was so attentive. A gentleman from the band approached our children and gave them stuffed animals. The manager opened the door and welcomed us back on our way out. We just had an overall great experience and will defientely recommend this place and come back for more. 
Although I couldn't pronounce the dishes, the description was well said that it helped me decide. All of our food and apps were amazing. Most certain I would like to try more of what is on the menu. Thank you for our wonderful night!"}
{"text":"Tasty pho that is complex in flavor. Other great options are the wings, curry and summer rolls. Service is consistent and attentive. Locale features rotation of strong local acts like Sugar Thieves, The Effects and many others, plus radio broadcast highlighting bands. Highly recommend this place. Make it a point to put this place on your radar."}
{"text":"What a disaster.  I go in with my girlfriend, we sit, the place is almost empty. I use the men's room, it smells like the sewer line is open.  Come back, we order a beer and a white wine.  Waitress comes back with a room temperature glass of wine, I get a bottle, no glass to pour it in.  Waitress disappears, I go up to bar to get a glass, and the guy at the bar does a 90 degree turn away from me.  Eventually he comes back, I ask for a glass, and my dining partner asks for white wine that isn't warm.  OK, food time.  We both order Pho Ga', chicken pho.  My chicken is half cooked, and the pieces are all ligaments and muscle.  Waitress gives us our food, says she will be right back with napkins, but never comes.  After several minutes she comes by to ask how we are doing, I say \"uh, napkins\", and she runs to get them, drops them off on the table and blithely says \"no problem!\".  Well, there is a problem, when she comes back again, I show her undercooked chicken with all kinds of gristle and un-chewable bits on it.  She apologizes and offers to get me something else...well, if you can't cook chicken, then I don't want anything else.  I ask for the check and get another snotty \"no problem!\" response.  Well, there is a problem, bad food, bad service, dangerously under cooked chicken and a bathroom that smells like death.  No, I'm not going back, there are plenty of quality Pho restaurants out there that offer quality food and good service.  This place is a disaster.

Edited to add 5/26/16:  After posting this review, the manager, David Gump sent me a profanity laced email (he used the F word 4 times) and accused me of being cheap and trying to get a free meal...I NEVER asked for anything to be comped.  He also said that I was banned for life and that \"We have wars because of people like you.  You need to get back to school and get educated.\"  I'd post more of his email, but I do not wish to share the profanities that he sent to me.  His email to me really confirms that this is not a place I ever want to do business with again.  Please avoid this place and this unprofessional manager."}
{"text":"It seems like this place is trying to make it work, but it's barely working...

I got the surf and turf Pho and I got 2 pieces of beef and 2 pieces of shrimp for 9$, I'm not impressed. His was the house rice and it looked like a pile of mush! 
Staff was attentive and friendly...

Don't over charge the customer so you can afford a space as big as a warehouse!"}
{"text":"Look. The Pho is pretty good, but the service is awful. It's 1:08 and I still haven't received the coffee I ordered at 12:12. The place has one other guest so busy really doesn't qualify as an excuse for your delay. Our checks took over 20 minutes to get, one guy had to ask 3 times for his beer. On top of that, they put 12 customers on our receipt so that our group of 6 was charged gratuity (probably good because our waitress did not deserve a tip). I'm extra pissed because your staff failed to clean up the stickiness on and under my seat, and my shoes now are permanently sticky. Don't know that we will be back."}
{"text":"I was beyond impressed with my first experience here. So much that I would even say this is my new favorite spot in Tempe! The service was impeccable. The atmosphere was comfortable, with nice decor. Best part, the food! I ordered the Mongolian beef and it was perfect. I was with 3 other people that had also never been there before and everyone agreed that it was great! I cannot wait until my next visit so I can try the sushi."}
{"text":"Very good food. Environment is not your typical pho joint. It's a bar that does live music, and has covers charged on occasion. Which I personally find annoying. My meal is $10 and the cover just to sit is $5? No thank you. I suggest getting your order to go. Calling ahead is fast and they are very good about getting your food out to you once you get there. Servers and service is good and very friendly. I will be back for the pho but not the live music."}
{"text":"Great twist to a Pho setting! Loved it. Friendly, down to earth staff. Great food. Prompt service. Plenty of TV's if you're trying to catch a game. Music, on point!"}
{"text":"This is the first Pho restaurant that I've been to in phoenix - my boyfriend and I have gone here twice now- the food is good and it's reasonably priced. I get #13 and he always gets #1. He's never had Pho before and he loves this place! I think it's pretty good.  It's never crowded or super packed - there's always a place to sit and they have a huge bar and a bunch of TVs on the walls which is different for a Vietnamese style restaurant haha...a few people have commented on the smell of the restaurant and they must've done something about it because I've never noticed a weird smell. Overall I give this place a four stars - it's not the most amazing Pho I have had but I will probably go there again."}
{"text":"They do a great job at this place I go there at least once or twice a week.  Soup is good and they have coconut here.  I don't have to drive to north Phoenix for good pho."}
{"text":"Yum. We've been here twice now and absolutely love the food.  We tried another place down the street and it was SO bland and boring - Pho Cao's food is all extremely flavorful.  Serving sizes are generous, prices are decent, and the food is amazing.  Surf and turf pho is our favorite! I did dock a star because it's very dive-y.  They have fairly loud local acts and open mic nights and it's very dark in there for dinner.  If you can deal with that, though (which I recommend), the food is spectacular and service is above average."}
{"text":"So, I was actually a virgin to Pho until I tried it here for the first time. Now I can't get enough. It's delicious, filling as well as healthy.  I was told by a worker there that they cook the broth for 24 hours. I tried the beef and the chicken, both were equally tasty. The portion is large. One soup makes two full meals for me. Very fair prices too.  

The staff was very welcoming and friendly when I went, which is the main reason why I keep going back.  The restaurant does look like a dive bar for sure which I was not expecting when I walked in, but its still a nice local place to eat.  

Tip- they have karaoke if your into that"}
{"text":"Bland Bland Bland the food was awful and the server never asked how everything was because she already knows the answer it is awful. Do not waste your money! Talk about a surprise when you walk in to a nightclub like bar."}
{"text":"The food here is really good. I feel like the environment could use a bit of a renovation but the main attraction is the bowls of Pho and they are phenomenal. 

One night there were all screaming/ metal band with enough wattage to power an EDC concert it was deafening lol).

I wont ding them too hard because I am sure it was not done on purpose or maybe I didn't realize it was a metal concert that night."}
{"text":"We love the Bun  Bo Hue, or spicy beef noodle soup. If you like pho, you have to try this. Thicker noodles, darker spicier broth, and it has a mixture of meets.

The fried egg rolls are bomb! But most Vietnamese egg rolls are bomb, so what can I say.

They have a Bo Luc Lac dish, or shaken beef thats pretty good. I would rate it a 3 of 5 because Ive had better. Its a little too sweet for my palate."}
{"text":"The food was absolutely amazing , had a really good dinner before catching a movie on a Saturday night. 
The waiter was great and attentive on refilling our waters , plus the food came fast , which was great because I was starving! They play good relaxing music with good ambulance .... Highly recommend coming here! Will deff be coming back soon :)"}
{"text":"Great atmosphere and friendly staff. Only had a taste of a few items as I am a vegan but the non-vegans in our group really liked their food."}
{"text":"Husband and I went here for the first time tonight......  we are new to this area of Scottsdale and always like to try out the nearby businesses wherever we live... especially love to support family run businesses opposed to big franchise whenever we can. We don't know a lot about Vietnamese cuisine but have eaten it before at a couple other places over the years, including a food truck operation that offered up pho and other vietnamese foods; my husband had the pho with chicken and they bring you the broth and the add ins separately so you can add what you want ....since they do include Jalapeños, nice to be able to add what you prefer to spice it to your liking; I had the pineapple rice with chicken and shrimp which was served in a half of a pineapple, was wonderful and attractively presented.  Portions are very ample, hubby did devour every drop of his soup and I brought enough leftovers home for both of us tomorrow  :) While eating we enjoyed some awesome blues.... I understand this band is there regularly..... great service, the staff was wonderful, it's a fun place to people watch and we look forward to coming back often...."}
{"text":"Extremely disappointed, tonight is the last night time I will ever give this place money. We placed an order through Postmates for crispy rolls, 2 chicken phos and a side of rice, got charged around $33 for everything. We received our food and noticed they forgot 1 of the phos. Mind you this happens constantly at Pho Cao and we're always having to drive back for something they forgot. Anyway, we called to tell them they forgot 1 pho and like any business with good customer service they would acknowledge their mistake and try to fix the situation, that was the complete opposite here. The OWNER started getting very angry and arguing on the phone about how it's Postmates fault and we need to call them when clearly it wasn't, we then said we had no problem driving over to get the 1 pho they forgot and he just continued to argue with us and be rude. After about 10 minutes of the OWNER being extremely unprofessional and extremely rude we told him we will not be going to his establishment any longer and hung up. There are plenty of good places that serve great pho that don't have owners who are crooks."}
{"text":"Yay !!! Finally found a pho place that actually open till 2am!! And so I thought........this place is baaaaaddddd  !!! I order pho with steak, tripe, tendon... The broth taste terrible .. it literally taste like they open a can of chicken broth cook it and add white noodles to it!! Shoot I can make better pho than this ... And I don't know how lol  my friend order ramen noodle(something like that) he said \"ramen noodle make better ramen than that\" hahaha  guess he's not a fan too. On a positive note They do have live band ... On the look for another pho place"}
{"text":"First impression....I keep expecting to look up and see John Taffer charging in with the camera crew to shoot an episode of \"Bar Rescue\".... Oh my god.  Came here with the idea of having Vietnamese food, but I think I made a huge mistake! Its dark, dingy, and there's a speaker directly above the table blaring reggae at me (the server said she'd turn it down, but hasn't happened yet...).  Mkay.  My first reaction is to run for the door. (I should have!)
We split an order of spring rolls as an appetizer, well more of a side dish since it came out with everything else.  Very disappointing at $6-- mostly brown lettuce inside.  I could only choke down half of one, and no one was interested in the other half.  Oh, I seriously should have gone!
I ordered the combo fried rice ($12) because it was the most reasonably priced entree and I felt it wouldn't make me sick.  The rest of the menu was too outrageously over priced for me to consider ($15 for stir fried beef w/onions and bell peppers? $13 for sort of pork chop and rice? Really?!). Again, I should have just said no.  It was ok, but I was not about to touch those three partially deveined, partially shelled, rubbery shrimp! Ew! The tv dinner pea/carrot mix is kind of expected (but usually at a much lower price point!). The quantity was sufficient, but that may have had more to do with my loss of appetite than anything else.  
Top it off with $2.75 for a glass of diet coke, and you can call me less than thrilled about my experience here today.
I've said before, I don't mind paying a little more for quality.  When I'm charged quality prices and you don't deliver, I get pissed.  This was $35 for a pretty bad lunch.  I work hard for my money and I don't like wasting it.
So unless you're going in as the mole for \"Bar Rescue\"-- take my advice and run.  Run for the door and get in your car! Don't look back! Just go."}
{"text":"Good food. Great atmosphere. And the pho is great. Fast service and not over priced. I'd recommend this place to anyone"}
{"text":"If I had to describe this oriental eatery in one word, it would be atrocious. The service, the cuisine, and the atmosphere made me wish I had no taste buds, ears, or senses of any kind. I came with 3 tantalizing young women, who were promptly cat called by a cretin on the way in. Granted, they were all drop dead gorgeous, but they were not impressed. Upon entering this pathetic excuse for an establishment, we were distraught to see that 2 heathens were playing guitar and singing folk tunes on the restaurant's incredibly loud speakers. Imagine the worst voice you've ever heard in your life. Then imagine a worse voice than that one. We were subjected to the previously mentioned voice crooning horrific show tunes for well over half an hour. We had nowhere to run. Nowhere to hide. We were prisoners of this deplorable human and he got off to our anguish. If you see Pho Cao on the way home from work on a sleep Sunday afternoon, turn around. Drive. Drive fast. Drive until you reach the ocean. Then start swimming. If there is a hell, I've been there. It is Pho Cao."}
{"text":"This is just about the only place I know where you can get a bowl of pho late."}
{"text":"Update to my last review: the management contacted me via Yelp the same day to apologize. Their chef mixed up the beef stew sourdough bread with the baguettes, which is why my sandwich was a disaster.  They offered to bring me back for another meal (on them) but unfortunately I had already left town. 

Kudos to them for taking customer satisfaction seriously! I'll try again when I'm back in town."}
{"text":"I went in for pho because our usual place was closed so we decided to try it ... Tastes less pho I got the stake I didn't like it never going back"}
{"text":"Where do I even begin with this place. The entrance looks like it leads to a gambling den, the interior is like a pub on Sukharmvit in Bangkok. On to the food!

The Vietnamese Iced Coffee I order is bunk because the sweetened condensed milk is locked in the manager's office (what) ... the fried rice has eggshells in it and the meat in the pho tastes of freezer burn. The broth is middling, the noodles are clumped together and the cross-eyed lucky cat in the corner is telling me I made a mistake.

Not twice though."}
{"text":"Ordered the Vietnamese Sandwich, spring rolls (not fried), and seafood  Pho  which were  flavorful (broth is well made). Friendly staff, and quick service."}
{"text":"Awesome place and they open until very late! I was very hungry because I didn't eat dinner that day and I was able to make an order at 1am from my iPhone Yelp app. I went to pick up the food and the food taste really great! I totally recommends this place!"}
{"text":"the set up is nice, but the food is awful.  I had chicken teriyaki and asked for noodles instead of white rice.  the chicken was slimy and it did not look or taste like chicken and the noodles were stuck together when I put my fork in them the whole bunch came up.  When I told them it was awful they still wanted to charge me full price.  They only gave me a 10% discount.  That's poor business I won't recommend or every eat there again."}
{"text":"Love the Buddha spring rolls. Best peanut sauce I have ever had. Crispy noodles hit the spot but my recommendation is to ask for extra sauce because it is delicious. 

Couple days ago I had the veggie pho and it was wonderful The main reason that I came back decides the kettle one mule which was one of the best mules I ever had"}
{"text":"I order this place just about once a week now that it's cold from Door Dash. I always get the ramen and they never fail me! I always get my order in a timely fashion I know it's also door dash being on top of it but the restaurant too, they have to be sure the food is ready to go when they arrive. 
Pho Cao is just delicious, I've had some of their other entrees as well and this place taste authentic and it's perfect now for the chilly whether. Ordering from home or going in store either way it's yummy"}
{"text":"The phó wasn't especially authentic, but it was pretty good. The service was fine as well. I don't remember my waiters name but he was nice. I intend on giving the place another chance but Phó Cao did not stand out to me."}
{"text":"Service great. Pho good. Atmosphere- weird in a good way. I'd come here again. Food came fast and exactly the way I wanted. Bartender/server fully aware of my needs and intuitive. Loved it."}
{"text":"Don't order the food... We went to watch a show here and I got really bad food poisoning from it. A couple family friends said the exact same thing. Drinks were okay, and the place looks very nice, so it's a shame that the food wasn't good and may have been handled improperly"}
{"text":"Amazing pho and the staff is super friendly and knowledgeable. Everyone says it's a weird atmosphere but I love it because it's different, it's jazz music in a bar atmosphere with amazing food you can't go wrong here."}
{"text":"We love our pho.  Boyfriend had a taste for pho, we then googled the nearest places. Stopped by this place and quite surprised, live bands were playing, good sized bar, good menu choices and priced right. The spring rolls w/peanut sauce was good.  Our seafood pho was also very tasty. Was unsure about the place walking in, but all in all was good."}
{"text":"Got Pho here once and it was good!  Also had some tasty chicken wings and eggrolls.

Not sure what's going on inside the restaurant itself, it looks like it used to be a sports bar/party bar and now they serve pho and sushi?  I don't think I'd try the sushi here.

Lots of beers on tap, looks like a great spot for happy hour if you're near the 202 and Scottsdale Road in Tempe."}
{"text":"This place is great and open late. It's always nice to have a vietnamese restaurant open for those of us who love eating late."}
{"text":"I ate here on a rainy Sunday and the service was pretty terrible. Very slow throughout the process. The chicken pho was very tasty. The interior of the place needs a revival."}
{"text":"Best pho in town and killer atmosphere. I would happily write an extensive review written exclusively using pho puns but I'm too drunk thanks to the strong drinks and dope servers, especially Chris."}
{"text":"Best place ever. Victor is the man. Some friends and I had a party here and we were challenging guests: more people showed up than expected, we brought glitter and it got all over the floor, and we set up decorations all over the place. The staff was very accommodating and even offered smoke machines (which, of course, we took advantage of). They gave the birthday boy an awesome shirt as a present and let us bring in a dancer. Can't recommend this place enough. Great food, strong drinks, and fun karaoke on Thursdays."}
{"text":"This has been an awesome experience!  Not only were our pho and summer rolls the best we've had, Toan, our waiter, was amazing!!!  So polite, personable, and competent!  Yea, Toan!  Great, affordable wine, too!  See you in October, Toan:)"}
{"text":"The waiter knew that this was our first time with Vietnamese food but still recommended the number one with tripe and tendon. My guest was very unhappy. We went to lunch elsewhere after she tasted it"}
{"text":"The atmosphere: 
This is a hip little pho place. There was live music the evening we went. It was a variety of different genres. If you're looking for a quiet atmosphere, I'd recommend checking to see if they have live music that night. We went on a Sunday evening, and it was not ideal for conversation. 

The food:
The pho is awesome! If you're a vegan/vegetarian they have great options (including vegan broth), and the veggie pho has great flavor. The other pho variants were liked in the group as well. If you're a bloody Mary fan, they put a Vietnamese twist on it, and I highly recommend it. If you're looking for a pho place, look no further. 

The service:
In general the wait staff was pleasant, polite and eager to help. It seemed as though they were understaffed, but the servers were all accommodating and apologetic for the delays. Hopefully it was just an issue of being down a server.

In summary, great pho, hipster vibe (may not be great for conversation depending on the evening), service was ok."}
{"text":"I ordered takeout for my husband and I for dinner.  I really liked the vibe, I felt like I was in a neighborhood bar restaurant back in ny. Very refreshing to not be in your typical Scottsdale franchise.  I ordered at the bar, the bartender was friendly and very helpful. As I waited for my food I observed a mixed crowd. Family with a baby, college students ,older women chatting with me at the bar, while the band was warming up. It was very clean and comfortable. I ordered Salmon Spring Rolls  which was the only food item I didn't care for ,everything else was really good. I also had the pineapple fried rice which was served in  a pineapple! We also had the endamame Sauteed in garlic, chili and I think lemongrass . We also got spring rolls that were soo good and my husband got some fried rice dish with meat and he loved it! I'm so excited to have a great ethnic restaurant / bar in my neighborhood,  finally!"}
{"text":"Let's start with it took ten minutes for us to be noticed by the one server there. The manager or what ever informed us that she was the only one working. We then received menus and ordered our food and drinks. We got a sake bomber which was cold sake served in a dirty glass. The glass was dirty so we showed it to the bartender and she gave us a new one which was still cold. We have never been served cold sake before so we weren't really sure what was up with that. We then got our food. The six dollar spring rolls were definitely not worth it. Just lettuce with a STOP of pork wrapped in rice paper. The pho was actually really good! We are our food the bartender was noticeably over whelmed forgetting my drink order but brought it right when I reminded her. Then we get the check. Keep in mind it was happy hour. Never have I been charged separately for beer and sake. 8 dollars all together. And my little 8 ounce mixed drink was nine dollars. When I showed her these were not happy hour prices she said they didn't have happy hour on weekends. It was Thursday. She then told us it was happy hour prices. Um 9 dollars a drink for happy hour?!? Needless to say I was not happy with my experience here and will not be coming back. Yes the pho was good, but pho than is better with better service. I would not waste your time here I felt like I was on AND episode of bar rescue."}
{"text":"This was good, If I have to criticize anything the broth was a bit weak other then that it was all very good. Walking into the place is not what you would expect, but I do like the vibe. A pho place that plays reggae while you watch anything from college ball to lord of the rings and apparently in Thursday's they have a stage for karaoke. lol I'm gonna have to try and catch that!"}
{"text":"Very different atmosphere since it is a bar.  With tons of live music!  And the food is really good too!  The menu has more variety than expected and I'm definitely looking forward to trying out more from this neighborhood joint.  Also has a happy hour drink menu."}
{"text":"Awesome place, great atmosphere!!! They have music nightly, amazing value and the owner rocks!!! Best Vietnamese food in Arizona hands down! Seems like a great date spot or if you want to come have drinks with your friends."}
{"text":"I don't even want to give one star for this.

Just moved to Tempe and was really excited to find a pho restaurant so close. Was a little weirded out, nobody was there on a Friday night. Waiter was nice and we ordered 3 bowls of pho and I got a smoothie.

Smoothie was made with expired ROTTEN milk, the waiter said \"Oh, well I smelled it to check if it was okay and it seemed fine.\" He said I wouldn't have to pay for it so I ordered a drink from the bar instead. Took a peek in there and found a nice live bug floating around on top. 

At this point we were all sick to our stomachs, didn't eat any of the pho they brought out because who knows what is floating around in there. I told the waiter about the bug, he sighed and said \"Oh fuck\". I just told him we were leaving and we still got charged for the pho we didn't eat.

All around terrible experience. Got to hold my sister's hair as she threw up from disgust when we got home! Thanks Pho Cao!"}
{"text":"Not all pho restaurants are created equal and this place is no exception.  I can't complain though.  The servings are big and very filing. Atmosphere is kind of dark with black and orange painted walls but i can't rate them on the color of their walls everyone has different taste.  All in all this place is good I will be returning..oh!  And about pho soup being great for colds and hangovers. .this is so very true."}
{"text":"great price and excellent service 

tried chicken pho delicious !!"}
{"text":"I enjoy visiting Pho Cao for Vietnamese food (Spring Rolls & Pho). 
I love the Live Music atmosphere. 
I go to Gypsy's Blues Jam on Tuesdays whenever I can. She's a gracious host & it's a fun jam! :)"}
{"text":"Its a Pho Shop with many other things. They offer sushi here as well. They also do Karaoke live.

There is a dance floor with sofa seating and a couple of tables/booths. There is also a staging area.

The food is pretty good, big portions. I usually get the beef and meatball pho with spring rolls and my bf gets either the fried rice or the thick rice noodles with chicken. 

Ive come across this place because my family does parties here. Yes you can book parties at this restaurant, one other thing is that they remain open for the public if you are having the party. So the owner doesnt completely shut it down. 

On the weekends they are open until 2 am, for those craving late night pho or whatever. Since all other restuarants usualy closes by 10, you still have the option of coming here. 

The owner is very friendly and cool, and so if the staff."}
{"text":"Nice to have pho available late night but the music is so loud you can't even the person across from you. Food is decent it was nice to make my pho to my preferred level of spicy-ness. Pretty full bar, ample amount of seating, easy to locate and decent amount of parking. Still can't get over how loud it was though"}
{"text":"This place is something else! And I mean that in the best of way possible! This place is not like any other place I have been to. Going around Tempe on one of my nightly Adventures. Looking for a place that's open late is hard to come by, stepping upon this pho place that's open till 2 am is a stop we'll make. Wasn't to sure at first, but hey minus well give it a try and may I say I'm glad I did. Walking into the place I was amazed. Cause it's not only a pho place but a bar and karaoke place! I was amazed, cause it's like killing two birds with one stone. I enjoy eating pho and singing as well so you can say the first time experience here was amazingly great. The good was yummy! And their Thai iced tea hit the spot! I added a scoop of ice cream in it and it was beyond yummy! I didn't mind the extra price at all. Besides the food and the first impression I got from the place. The customer service is great. We were seated by a gentlemen who had took his time to seat us even if he clocked out for the day. And our waitress was super nice, I just wish there were more waitresses out there just like her.  She answered all my questions and not once looked annoyed or anything just patient and understanding. If your looking for a pho place that's open late, fun, relaxing, and has yummy food. This is the place to be :)!! You won't regret it."}
{"text":"I came here this evening to get dinner after swim practice at the Sun Devil Fitness Complex. It's easy enough to get to from ASU, as it's pretty much right beside the 202, just a quick turn from Scottsdale Rd. Upon entering, you'd think this is more of a bar and grill than a pho restaurant, but it really is both of these. I was immediately seated and given a glass of water and  a menu. I ordered the soft spring rolls and the salted fish fried rice, and didn't have to wait long before the food arrived at my table. Both were very good and the food here is quite inexpensive, comparable to most pho places in the Valley. Service was fast and efficient, and I'm definitely looking forward to coming here again for dinner, as the quality and quantity of food are a good match for my hunger after the strenuous swim team workouts at the nearby SDFC. And contrary to what one reviewer stated in her review, this place is definitely not shutting down; in his response, the owner has sufficiently explained why she misinterpreted what she saw and experienced during her visit."}
{"text":"Just got the best spicy pho. Just what I needed with a head cold and a rainy evening. Love that I can assemble it myself at home and add ALL THE CHILI. 

Very nice and FAST service and told me about all the music nights they have (different theme every night with Monday's dark). 

I'll definitely return to dine-in!"}
{"text":"Be prepared for live music with full bands either on or closer to the weekend. If you're looking for a nice quiet pho place to take your family or sweetie, not exactly the place. The broth is a little sweeter and all the add-ins are fresh."}
{"text":"I tried ordering with them online through yelp, out of no where I have multiple charges coming from San Francisco for uber and numerous things DO NOT use your card with this place because it looks like they're trying to do some carding fraud it may not be the owner but it's definitely a employee or something pay cash"}
{"text":"Wow. Sooooo yummy Pho, Shrimp with Pork, Thai Tea, Edamame and Orange Chicken. No complaints at all and really enjoyed it. We will be back."}
{"text":"I absolutely love this restaurant because I am able to order phõ with vegetable with a vegetable based broth. The servers are always full of energy and knowledgeable. The best part is they serve incredibly late and they are located next to Bosa Donuts, so if you need something sweet you can head next foor"}
{"text":"This place was a dissapointment. It smells inside, but my fiance and I decided to give it a chance since it was highly recommended. My fiance ordered pho and I ordered the yellow curry. The beer was flat and the broth in my dish was watered down. It wasnt worth the money we spent and we would not go there again."}
{"text":"Food is decent, not the best but will do. Atmosphere seemed a bit off or lost, service is slow and waiters are forgetful but friendly. Decent portion and price however."}
{"text":"I'm Vietnamese and this restaurant is great. The boss is super cool and their food is good. Go here for your pho needs. Oh and they're open 24hrs :D"}
{"text":"Missed the band.  Flat beer.  No roses lime juice.  Great staff and a cool crowd.  Wish WWF got here earlier.  Will come back."}
{"text":"Great service. Bomb Pho!!! Always my favorite go to food when I'm just hungry and not craving anything..."}
{"text":"We tried to go to a Pho place that was recommended to us by a friend but was closed. Did a quick yelp search and found this place that had just opened. 

It was pretty empty at 1pm with only 4 tables occupied. Service was good except the kitchen messed up on our orders which is hard to believe as, with most Pho places, it's order by number. No biggie, the fixed it. 

On to the Pho itself. First the size. The regular and large are not much different and the large is smaller then most place I've gone. The broth itself was OK but not anything special. The meat was lacking, not in quality but quantity. Overall it was a decent bowl of Pho but not something I would drive to in order to have. If I was in the area and needed a quick Pho fix, sure, but nothing more."}
{"text":"something about this place is odd.  it is right off the freeway, tucked in a corner next to a hotel. 
got spring rolls, egg rolls, shaken beef, and vermicilli.  egg rolls were quite good, wrapped with a lettuce and dipped into fish sauce.  spring rolls were mehhhhh. and its hard to go wrong with spring rolls.
vermicilli had lots of fatty pieces of meat...ill pass

the vietnamese iced coffee was probably the best thing we got.

they have a full bar. and a sushi bar, but no sushi..."}
{"text":"I was having an oil change nearby so I checked the reviews of this place and decided to give it a try.  I will say that the place has a bad odor when you walk in.  Kind of smells like a stinky old bar.  Certainly not very appetizing.

 I ordered the ramen noodle pho to try something different.  The pho comes with rare steak and brisket, ramen noodles, and a boiled egg.  The broth was pretty nice and the meat was fairly decent.  However, the cilantro and basil on the side looked as if it came out of the trash or the alley behind the restaurant.  Very poor quality, dry and wilted.  I would have liked to have tried the fresh spring rolls, but they were a little pricey.  They were double what I am used to paying at other Vietnamese places in the area.

Finally, there was a charge to use my credit card, which was not posted anywhere.  I had cash, but by the time I checked my receipt, it was too late to change it."}
{"text":"Pho cao dao from Cali will never top any pho I'll ever eat but surprisingly I enjoyed the pho from this resto. The noodles were fresh and their crispy rolls was cooked to perfection. Definitely would come back again! Yum!"}
{"text":"Worst experience ever hair in the rice, cold tea, cold food, diarrhea for the day, waitress argued the fact that the tea water was mad by the morning crew...it was 7:30 pm. Spoke with the manager Victor for an adjustment, was told if I removed my review. U take the chance if u dare!"}
{"text":"Comfortable atmosphere and Great Vietnamese food!!  Their Pho broth is one of the best I've had in town, and is always so fresh and delicious.  Besides the pho, the also have some fantastic rice dishes.  The Shaken Beef (Bo Luc Lac) is incredible; chopped cubes of filet mignon cooked with onions and peppers.  The sliced BBQ Pork and Grilled Shrimp plate is excellent as well.  I'd also recommend saving some room for dessert and get the Coconut ice cream, which they serve in a fresh coconut with a chilled glass of the Coconut milk on the side.  If you'd like a new Vietnamese restaurant, look no further ."}
{"text":"Just went to this place the food was really good and the staff was very friendly.  I ordered the ramen dish with a side of white rice. The food was served in less than 10 minutes and was super hot."}
{"text":"I'm here right now. It's my first time. My friends took me her for my birthday. Service was great! Food was okay. Being Vietnamese everything tasted on the bland side.. The main reason why I gave this place a 2 star is we came here on Thursday for karaoke .. You write your name on a list to wait in line. I got a chance to sing my song and my friends we right behind me on the list but for some reason they didn't get to sing after me.. So I was confused.. I believe the DJ for the karaoke puts up people he know and regulars first before us.. Which is a totally unfair and bias. I don't get how a restaurant will gain new regulars when they do this to new people. Probably will be my first and last time here. Was a fun spot til that happened. :/"}
{"text":"Place to come for Pho and live music. The servers are very friendly. Please is clean and prices"}
{"text":"I've been to Pho Cao many times and have always enjoyed my experience! My girlfriend and I love the PHO and Saki Bombers! I'm kind of new to Yelp and don't usually leave reviews unless it deserving and Pho Cao is as good as it gets if your looking for Vietnamese food that is priced right!"}
{"text":"This was my first time eating Pho. My girlfriend and I had such a great first impression here and I definitely know we'll be back soon.

We walked in to what seemed to be a side entrance to the restaurant. The bartender that was working was extremely polite, professional, and a hard worker. He greeted us as soon as we walked in, explained what Pho was when we asked, and gave us some iced water with lemon as we waited for our order. We put in a to-go order and the food came out very quickly. 

I have a feeling that my girlfriend will be begging me to come back to Pho Cao soon!"}
{"text":"Ok...so we wanted quick,  healthy, yummy. Something to feed a CARNIVORE and a VEGAN.

This place was BEYOND good and met EVERY demand.

We were initially a little put off by the lack of windows and side entrance.  When we walked in, our eyes needed to adjust to the dim lighting.  Little did we know how quickly it would happen and what AMAZING epicurean adventures awaited us.

Take a chance.... this place is AWESOME!!!"}
{"text":"I've been a regular for the past 3 years. I came in to new location order lollipop Wings only to be disappointed they came and we're regular typical wings nothing special and definitely not lollipop wings? Came back a couple weeks later normally they have the very best broth for Pho very rich and full of flavor. Again I was disappointed it tasted like tap water that was over chlorinated. Never have I had a problem with the Pho before. Hopefully they pull it together and get consistent as far as food quality and service."}
{"text":"I've only been here twice. 

The first time around, I was actually picking up a to-go order for my daughter, who was ill at that time.

The second time, we stopped by here after having spent nearly all day at the Scottsdale Pavilions doing indoor skydiving and go-karting.

It was open mic night, and there were a few performers exhibiting their guitar prowess. 

To be honest, this place is a dive. If we dined here with that mindset, we wouldn't have had such an issue with the Pho that we had ordered.

We often sample a new Pho place each month; therefore, we are pretty well versed as to what to expect as far as texture and flavor. 

However, we became very concerned with the actual texture of what was being passed as beef. It didn't look like real beef. And it didn't taste like real beef. It actually had the appearance of a frozen beef packet that was summarily boiled.

And the Pho itself didn't have the tangy flavor that we were accustomed to. 

Couple that with the lack of utensils, and our inability to actually get the attention of a server that wasn't distracted by the event. It didn't make for a good impression regarding our dine-in experience.

I did give this place two stars because the local talent they had were actually quite entertaining and provided some levity from our dissatisfaction with both the food and the service."}
{"text":"Easy, seamless ordering through yelp's online service. Order was confirmed within 10 min and set to be ready 10 min after that. There was a short wait when we got there for pickup, but the staff was apologetic and did their best to hurry things along. Minus 1 star for the amount of chicken in the Pho Ga (seemed a little skimpy) but the broth was incredible and the overall taste profile knocked it out of the park. We will certainly be going back, and may even do dine in to check out some of their live music."}
{"text":"Fun place.  Went there for the first with a couple friends on a Thurs. night for karaoke and some drinks.  We generally go to various karaoke bars in the east valley and wanted to give this one a shot.  Crowd was definitely a 20's crowd, however I think there was a special celebration going on that night that brought in the big group.  

Phil does karaoke on Thurs nights there and he always does a great job.  Drink prices were reasonable but nothing to brag about.  Will probably venture back there again."}
{"text":"I took my girl friend out for our anniversary to have lunch at Pho Cao.  We were greeted right away and seated at the window booth. We ordered salmon spring rolls and summer rolls as appetizers.  My girl friend raved about how delicious they were. For entrees we ordered filet mignon shaken beef and Pho dac biet (Pho Cao).  The beef was tender and tasty.  The pho was delicious--the best broth I've ever had. The taste of the beef broth is hard to find in many other pho restaurants.  The service was excellent.  The server Natalie was very attentive and came to check on us if we needed anything during our meal.  She even suggested the berry smoothies for dessert.  My girl and I loved it so much that we ordered another one for to-go.  The total bill was $38 dollars.  $38 is very cheap for the quality of food and the service we received.  We always spend at least $70 or more for two when we order appetizers, entrees and desserts.  

We also learned that Pho Cao is only place open 'til 2:00 am for Pho in the valley.  We'll definitely be back to get some late night pho.  I would highly recommend Pho Cao to anyone looking for some quality Pho."}
{"text":"If I could give a negative star, I would.  Dirty/dark old bar. Ordered Saki, glass were filthy and dingy. Menu prices are higher than the online price lists. Owner had excuses to give his staff, but wouldn't come out and speak with us. 
We eat Pho weekly, in Seattle.  This was disgusting and an embarrassment to anything Pho. Even the waitress said she prefers eating Pho anywhere else. 
I would never return or recommend this place to anyone!"}
{"text":"To be honest the decor is bizarre. And the service CAN be questionable along with the live music. Not your typical Vietnamese restaurant that's for certain, but the food is always always delicious. Great pho always and very consistent. Potstickers and crispy egg roles are to die for! If you can keep an open mind and don't let the surroundings rub you the wrong way I definitely recommend."}
{"text":"I am was excited to see a Pho place opening so close to my job, but this was one of the most disappointing experiences I've ever had! We were able to order right away, but watched 4 tables come in, get seated and served their food before we got our pho. We waited for 40 minutes before we got flavorless pho that was only very warm. The noodles in mine were undercooked yet the veggies were overlooked. One of the people that came in ordered, ate and paid in about 30 minutes, while we couldn't even get our change from out bill after being there for 2 hours! I will never come here again and tell everyone I know to avoid this place because you're going to wait 5 times longer than other guests for the most tasteless pho of your life!"}
{"text":"2 words.......HIDDEN JEM

If I lived closer to this joint I would be here every single night. We came in for a Sunday night open Mic.....cool atmosphere, great bartender. My wife had some noodles or ramen, next time we'll bring our appetites. 
Great bar and staff.  KEEP UP THE LIVE MUSIC!!!!!"}
{"text":"Up and running!

PHO CAO opened up this week in my neighborhood, I was hoping someone would take over the former Longshots and do something cool with it. Well some one did take it over and transplanted a Vietnamese Rock and Roll nightclub/restaurant. 

If you go, know this they haven't finished the place yet, at least I hope not. A severe lack of attention to detail persist through out this cavernous space.

Here are several observations on this Transplant in my hood.

1 I was hoping for better
2 Clean this place up, they need to hire a girl that likes to clean. All dudes on staff.
3 lighting is horrendous I hope they take a strong look at that and make some changes 
4 Do something with that bar, your liquor looks old and very disorganized, It's massively inefficient.
5 I hope the food improves my dish was just ok, I have heard great things just haven't tasted them yet. btw my order was incorrect but after we established the waiter misunderstood me and it wasn't made for someone else I insisted I keep it.
6 They need some bike racks lots of them, and light them up, Trust me on this.
7 I hope the smokers find a better place to smoke then just outside the front door.
8 This place actually needs a front door! The tiny black dirty metal door is not welcoming at all. They should drop a few bucks there for sure. in the interim put a plant, a porch light, and a rug there so customers don't have to guess how to enter. If it weren't for the smokers It would have taken more effort to find it.
9 Get a real website if they had a contact us, this would have been sent in private.

Positives
1 Live Music
2 Take out and delivery
3 Late Night Hours
4 Service was pretty good
5 This place has potential if the owners don't rest on past reputation and pay attention to details.
6 Great location on McDowell and 74th st. When the apartments are finished this place will be jumping.

I will return because I know it will be better then it was."}
{"text":"Ordered some Pho, but the server forgot to mention they were out of some meat and served the meal anyways without thinking id not notice.

They do have decent food, but i dont stand for dishonesty.
If they would at least told me the meat was out before they made the dish, id actually go back.
Still charged me the full price anyways..."}
{"text":"First time here, had the fried spring rolls and the soft summer rolls which were good. Also the rice noodles w/beef and the special fried rice was delicious. The place was definitely a dive, a bar turned into a Vietnamese rstrnt., Very little natural lighting (lack of windows) there even was a pool table. Would I go back? Sure if in the neighborhood!!!"}
{"text":"The pho was ok. However I definitely appreciate that they were open late on a Sunday night. The service was good, our server was very attentive the whole time we were there. The live music was pleasantly surprising. It was a bit loud when we arrived but definitely improved as different people took the stage. Over all it's a fun place."}
{"text":"One of my new favorites in Tempe.  Great broth, eggrolls, and the fact that they have a full bar makes me want to come for dinner too.  Being from Hawaii, and having pho be part of my weekly meal, it's important to search out the best of the best.  This will definitely be my place when I have a craving and find myself in Tempe!"}
{"text":"Like the food, but hate the karaoke. Still, it's a worthwhile tradeoff for late-night Vietnamese."}
{"text":"I love this place! It's kind of different they have entertainment, it's kind of dark inside but the food is outstanding, prices are good and staff is great! In fact I'm going again tonight. I checked groupon but unfortunately found none. Please get hooked up with groupon. See you tonight!"}
{"text":"2018 and I've hit the first pho spot that has sent me to the heavens, good lord... 

First off: lunch special comes with 3 potstickers and a large bowl of pho. steal

Lucas, is a great server unique personality,  
I'm probably coming back here before I leave please eat here"}
{"text":"My hairdresser is Vietnamese and recommended that I try this restaurant. She said they cook their pho for 2 days and that it's one of her favorite spots for pho. It's a little Americanized (per her) but still delicious.

I went there tonight with my boyfriend and we had a great experience. I ordered the chicken pho and he got the shaken beef, although we essentially ended up sharing. Both were top notch and highly recommended. In fact, while eating, we were discussing the 100% chance of coming back and more or less deciding when and who to bring along. They have a happy hour 3-6pm and 11pm-2am where drinks are  $1+ off. They had a ton of local and imported beers on tap and even more options in bottles. Anyway, if you're in the area, definitely try this place out and order the pho/shaken beef. I know I'm looking forward to coming to this place again. Yum!!"}
{"text":"Here is the best part...open on Sunday.  The other PHO joints around here are closed."}
{"text":"Late night pho and potstickers. Very good potstickers! The pho was a but bland though and the steak was a bit chewy but not bad. We were going out for sushi and found this place on yelp. Not seeing any sushi on the menu, we asked the waitress if they served sushi and she just said no. Looking into it more online, I guess they only serve sushi on Thursday through Sunday or something? Confused as to why the server didn't tell us that but whatever. That was my only complaint. Good place to eat and it's a plus that its open way late and the prices are good. Will come back when they are serving sushi."}
{"text":"Went here for a friend's birthday on a Saturday night.  Got there about 9:30p and it was pretty empty.  Sat at the bar and although the bartender was pretty quick to serve us, she wasn't the friendliest bartender I've ever encountered and there was something \"off\" with my drinks.  I was drinking vodka/sodas and they had a funny taste to them, almost like maybe there was something in the glass (cleaning residue or something?).  Bartender re-used my glass and it was less prevalent the second drink...

Wasn't overly impressed with the place until I got my shrimp pho... which was PHO-ntastic!  The broth was very good & there was plenty of it (I ordered the large because I LOVE me some broth!!!)  The pho was some of the best I had, and if the bartender had been a little more friendly and my drinks didn't have a funny taste, this would be an easy 5 star review.

The owner did greet us and even took pics of our group for the birthday girl, so that bumps it up to 4 1/2 stars.  

I will definitely be coming back when I need my pho-fix!"}
{"text":"Holy meh... Absolutely forgettable broth, overdone and too thickly cut beef. 

Really the broth offended me the most, it didn't taste bad but the flavor just wasn't all there. It almost tasted watered down.  Just mehhh... better places too be had. Pricey too, ban mih shouldn't cost more than $3.50 unless it's made with angel tears. 

Service was exceptionally slow for a pho joint but the portions were of a good size. Mind you, a huge bowl of spectacularly average pho isn't exactly a positive thing in my book."}
{"text":"I became an instant regular after my first visit.  20+ local & craft beers on tap, and some of the best pho I've ever had.  Has 2 huge TVs at the bar... I know where I'll be come football season!"}
{"text":"I've been to Pho Cao several times, all night or late-night.  The service is great.  Every staff member has been very nice.  The food is very good.  My only issue is it turns into a club/karaoke place at night.  I HATE karaoke, and having music that's so loud it's difficult to have a conversation is a bummer.  That being said...there's nothing better than late-night Pho!!!"}
{"text":"I've been coming here for several years now (since its previous location on Scottadale road), and find the pho quality acceptable for the most part, and love the atmosphere and service.  So maybe 3 stars for pho itself and 4 stars for the service/atmosphere? 
Problem is that I find the combination of the two features (pho and live music) a little dissonant.

Traditionally, pho is a breakfast meal and the broth can take all night to cook, eaten during a sliver of peaceful time you can find in the day.  Pho served here is indeed that-- big broth bowls for roughly $8/$11 for regular/large bowls. Quality is a little lower than other pho but is otherwise as traditional as any pho place you'd find in the US.
The type of music/karaoke that's done at Pho Cao, on the other hand, is the opposite of that (despite some good acoustic musicians here!).  I think it's awesome that the venue is trying to trendset the two, but honestly the pho quality doesn't support it.  The servers seem to work pretty hard but it's just not the same pho quality because of the interference with bar/drink duties on top of food.
If at all, I'd be willing to pay more for higher quality pho (and served differently than a traditional large bowl style) as that would jive better."}
{"text":"I like this place and will try it again.  One of the biggest portions of pho I've ever tried to cram down my soup hole (mouth)"}
{"text":"NOT a fan.  I went here for Blues Jam Night with some out of town friends.  That part of the experience was enjoyable.  My friend is a drummer and had a great time jamming out with the locals.  The mistake we made was ordering food from this establishment.  I am not sure really how this place calls themselves Vietnamese food.  I ordered the stir fried egg noodles with beef, spicy.  I am 100% they stir fried some ramen noodles with frozen peas, etc.  It wasn't spicy at all either.  It was very puzzling.  My friend ordered fried rice and I really think it was the premade frozen fried rice from Trader Joe's.  It had the ambiance of a dive bar and I think they should stick to that genre and lose the \"Vietnamese\" food.

Bottom line: the entertainment was entertaining, but the food was not good!"}
{"text":"8.50 for a regular bowl of Pho and 2.50 for a coke!!! Uh... How about no? After tip I spent $14. The pho here isn't even that great because the meat was odd tasting. Service was okay in that it was fast, but the ambiance of this place is off-putting. I was hesitant to come here, but not coming back because of price and atmosphere (and I came when it was quite)."}
{"text":"Pho was super tasty and so was the spring roll.  Tried the salmon spring roll and the salmon was way overdone.  Otherwise was great and Chris our server was very good too.  Will be back!!"}
{"text":"I had # 17 Cha Gio (4 Crispy Rolls) The fish sauce was not so good. & #15 Pho Ga (Chicken Pho) - the Large and it was good. Lots of food. It's worth giving it a try."}
{"text":"I think our expectations were a little different than what we got. 
This place is not so much a restaurant as it is everything else. It's a bar, it's a lounge, it's a live music venue. The menu is plentiful....plenty of asian cuisine, including Pho. But there's a pool table and a stage. And a musician performing an extensively long sound check. Once the band started, we ate as fast as we could not because the music was bad, but because it was too damn loud for us to hear each other talk!
The service had much to be desired. Our server, very young, had no idea what several of the menu items were when we asked questions about them. But instead of offering to ask the cook, he just stood there with his hands in his pockets saying \"Um, you know, I really don't know what that is\".....well....GO FIND OUT!
And I don't know if you've ever been the last to finish your food, but normally, the server leaves some plates. But instead of just letting us rest a bit, he was trying to take away our plates that still had food on them, and even while one of us was still eating, he asked if we wanted a to go box for her meal, and put the check out. At waffle house, sure...but we just expected a bit better. 
My clay pot with crunchy rice was anything but crunchy. It was basically steamed rice, beneath a layer of steamed vegetables with some thick sweet sauce poured on top of it. Not tasty at all. 
Anyway, we tried and we disliked."}
{"text":"If you're looking for Pho and live music, this is the spot for you! I came in on a Wednesday night because it was the only Pho place open and I was sure in for a surprise. They had live rock night. The vibe is totally dive-y. I don't know how well Pho and dive bars mix, but they did it right here. The Pho was really flavorful and served with all of the add-ins (jalapeño, cilantro, sprouts, etc.). I want to come here for dinner and drinks before a night out on a Friday. I feel like it would be an awesome pregame spot!!! All of their drinks had really clever names as well!"}
{"text":"After driving by this place a hundred times I finally found the time to make it inside. Glad I did. The service was fast and the food was delicious. It's not on the menu but the manager said he recently started offering vegan pho and I got that. I don't have much pho experience to compare it to but I found it to be very tasty. I also got the tofu/avocado veggie spring rolls with peanut sauce. Yum! I was stuffed after that so unfortunately I couldn't try the berry boba, next time! The owner is really cool and told me they have live music and karaoke thursday friday and saturday nights and they offer food til 2 am. Sweet! Good drink specials as well. Looking forward to my next trip back!"}
{"text":"The biggest bonus is how late this place stays open to. Sometimes when we get off work late, BF and I like to go here for the viet food because we want to talk and eat and don't want to go anywhere where they have everything with hashbrowns (you know what I mean).

Sure, it can loud and most times there's a raucous (but small) audience on the stage side. But you're across the room from them and it just means it's not creepy and dead inside.

We've been here a lot and the servers were always accommodating and nice. Docked two stars because the foods were ok.

Pho can get VERY specific. Most people get pho with everything but if you want to narrow it down to two things, this is perfect for you. There's a half and large size and prices are decent. A bit pricier than usual, I would say.

The broth is decent and the whole overall pho experience is decent. I tried the grilled salmon dish. Highly doubt it was grilled. It was okay and it was a pretty meager piece of salmon. Also had the banh mi. The filling was good and more generous than what I was expecting. Grilled meat and good pickled vegs. Awesome. It's pretty small, like 5 (maybe 6) inches. Also, the bread sucks. I would think it's really hard to mess up bread because banh mi USUALLY uses the same type of bread. I don't know what this is but it's a thin loaf of something that is so chewy. When I couldn't bite it off, I pulled it away while it was still clenched in my teeth and it almost pulled away like cheese. I kid you not."}
{"text":"They have a great lunch special of potstickers or eggrolls + large bowl of pho for like $10 or whatever but the actual pho was really underwhelming. The broth just was very bland and they served it with a fork--not very authentic. I can see how the south west isn't known for thriving pho/asian cuisine."}
{"text":"This pho is soooo delicious! The atmosphere is a little too grungy for me tho. The only reason it's getting three stars is because an hour for soup and 20 mins for a drink is a little too much. The waiter was panicked the entire time. Maybe more servers would make the experience better for everyone. GREAT food tho. Highly recommend for a snack or a first date. The server will definitely leave you alone."}
{"text":"This is a new location for Pho Cao since they moved.  I rather liked this location better than the first since it's easier to access and the layout is more open.  Open mic on Sunday evenings!  

I sat at the bar alone and at first Pho Cao somewhat still confuses me; Vietnamese Pho restaurant at a dive bar?  I guess it works in a sense, but I was just trying to watch the game and didn't care much for the performance.  I ordered a Export 33 to start and just a bowl of regular Pho.  They have ramen Pho, but I wasn't sure if I should go for it since I didn't feel to adventurous that night.  Overall, the Pho is pretty good.  Broth came nice and piping hot they way I like it!  I think the side sprouts, basil, and jalapeno could be at tad bit fresher, but maybe it's out of season.  

In the end, Pho Cao definitely caters to a new crowd that enjoys their Pho with a beer and live music.  You probably won't see many traditional Pho lovers here, but that doesn't matter.  I would like to point out I do appreciate good service here.  My bartender was busting her butt; as a former waiter, I totally understand that work life and appreciate what it has made me become.  Kudos to the bartender! - Enjoy!"}

I need to Bo Bites soon

....Pho Cao

One of the coolest Vietnamese restaurants in town!

I guess it can be bumped up to the next level of awesomeness!  Pho Cao is located at the edge of the city of Tempe just north of the 202.  I address that simply because the restaurant is oddly located and can be difficult to find!

Pho Cao is best during the evening hours because of the live bands and karaoke nights.  Hip and funky, Pho Cao provides entertainment and some cultural flare to your visit.  I'm a Pho snob so when I attended I order of course the Pho.  Overall, I thought it was okay at best.  It lacks the strong beefy broth that is pungent and salty at the same time.  Plus in the end, I like my broth super boiling hot where it almost burns my tongue. Yeah I'm pretty insane but I enjoy that!  

In the end, Pho Cao is an awesome place to hangout for drinks.  They have a full bar and drink specials on a daily basis.  They're opened till 2am so if you're in need of a Pho fix or just drinks.  This is your place to be! - Enjoy!"}
{"text":"My friend invited me to Pho Cao- thought it was going to be a sit down restaurant-- was surprised when i came and saw it was a bar with a live band! They were playing the beatles! Loved it. The food was pretty good, my friend had pho, I had spring rolls which were delicious! Our server Erin made sure we were taken care of. Thank you Erin!"}
{"text":"I used to LOVE this place, but it has declined in quality over the past 3 years. 

My boyfriend and I would eat here quite often when we first discovered it since it was not only delicious but had gluten free Pho as well, which can be a hard find. About 6 months into eating here I started getting MSG reactions to their pho multiple times. We cut back and they eventually stopped over adding MSG. 

Then a few months later the restaurant started getting a sewer smell. It was bad outside and even worse inside, to the point where I could not stay to eat there. One time our sake glass had dead insects in it (I'm guessing they didn't wash it out after months of sitting on the shelf). We've eaten there 2 times in the past 6 months due to all of this. Those past two times, the tofu in #16 has been cold in the middle and tasted old. The vegetables consisted of 80% cabbage. The servers were very slow to bring us our checks, so we decided that it would be our late night/early morning stop in case we were starving. The last straw was a few nights ago where the pho soup was COMPLETELY watered down. There was hardly any of the delicious pho flavors that give it its signature taste. 

All of these things combined has left a bad taste in my mouth. It makes me so sad to leave a poor review for this place because it used to be amazing, but it has a long way to go if it wants to be as good as it used to be."}
{"text":"It's ok. It doesn't feel like a pho place... more like a noisy dive bar. I mean, if you are into that then it's fine. I just like that it's open late and serves pho. Recently I had the ramen pho and it wasn't bad. I was expecting it to be terrible, but it wasn't!

Service was bad though. We waited 45 minutes before we got our food. The waiter cited that they were busy, but seriously? 45 minutes to dump some broth onto the noodles? Oh well.

I give it 3 stars because it's open late and it's not terrible pho. However, during the day, I'm heading to my usual pho place that's $4 cheaper, have better meat portions, faster service, and better tasting pho."}
{"text":"The overall place I like. It had a little of everything. You had decent pho, decent drinks, decent service, random karaoke and live bands, sushi being available and the greatest thing, BEING OPEN UNTIL 2AM. 

Sometimes, it's a good place to hang out that serve Asian food during the night. I can't think of any other place being open that late and not being a total \"bar\" or \"club\" like atmosphere. This place is chill and relaxed but can get quite loud with the music.

Come in and order a drink appetizer or pho late at night. Watch some sports or watch some bands or watch people doing karaoke.

The service is spotty because of the relaxed atmosphere. So watch out! But it's really nothing to complain about. This is definitely a good late night choice for food and alcohol. ;)"}
{"text":"First time here, but I'll definitely come back! I've been looking for someplace to get my pho on in this area and it's very good, as is the service. Large bowl of Pho Ga and two egg rolls for the lunch special!"}
{"text":"I came with my mom on a weeknight and we both enjoyed our experience. The restaurant/bar/lounge/nightclub(?) is an interesting concept but the service and food here were good. We started with the shrimp spring rolls and both ordered pho, I ordered meatball and my mom ordered chicken. The veggies for $2 extra is totally worth it too- they give you a lot of nice broccoli, carrots and other assorted veggies. Good prices here too- I would come back."}
{"text":"As soon as I walked into this place I knew there was no way I was going to order food. There are many small Vietnamese restaurants that sell better food for cheaper. Every thing about the place reeked of Scottsdale dive-ness. 

The dance floor is a tiny space that is cordoned off by some wood railings. The floor is the same dirty tile that covers the rest of the place. 

When I arrived on a Saturday night the floor was a mosh pit of young lower class Scottsdale hipsters. It was body to body, standing room barely, and people were allowed to carry booze onto the floor. People were pressing through the tables in an attempt to crowd into the tiny mosh pit. No way I was even going to try to dance there!

I would give the place a 1 star but they do deserve credit for having a lot of live music."}
{"text":"The food was great! And so was the waiter, but I wasn't a fan of the atmosphere at all. It's kind of dark and grungy inside. It looks like maybe a dive bar or karaoke bar at night, but it was mid day so that vibe wasn't what we were looking for and the music was so loud we could hardly talk. Food wise, everything tasted great! The prices were nice too. I'm sure if we came here in the evening to drink my review would have a different feel. In summery, if you are nearby and just want some simple and delicious pho, this is your place. Or if you order to go, you'll be happy. But maybe don't go out of your way to come here if you are looking for a cute atmosphere.
P.S. there's outdoor seating (we would have done this if it wasn't so cold that day...) and plenty of parking."}
{"text":"This place was horrible! Environment inside = wayyyyyy too dark! Went about 11am, going from the bright outside to super dark inside it took like 5 minutes for my eyes to full adjust to be able to see anything! Ordered our food... 2 spring roll appetizers and 2 bowls of pho, papaya salad, and lemongrass chicken. In a normal Vietnamese restaurant your spring roll is out in about 5-10min max from ordering... Then your pho follows shortly after.... Not this place!! 20min later ONE spring roll, the nem nuong came out.... Highly disappointed.... Would not have known it was nem nuong if I didn't order it.... Another 25min later our pho comes out along with the other 2 dishes .... Pho was bland and flavorless.  It should NOT take 40-45min to get pho ..... When there was only 3 other tables in the restaurant..... PLUS  we didn't even get the other spring roll we ordered!!! Completely disappointed.... Went to the location when it used to be next to the 202.... Figured we'd tried it one more time.... Will never go back.. There are much better Vietnamese restaurant around."}
{"text":"Very excited I came to this place. I gotta admit I went around 2 in the afternoon and there were Almost no cars in the parking lot and the building is pretty skeptical from the outside, but I thought hey why not! 
Pho with chicken and added veggies, my bowl came out super fast and overflowing with goodies inside! I was so busy enjoying the broth, veggies and meat I almost forgot about the noodles! 
Can't wait to come again!!



**I come here every week, now**"}
{"text":"Love this place! My favorite spot for pho with the best service. The staff is chill and super nice"}
{"text":"Worse customer service. I called to order my food the guy said can you please hold. 15 minutes still on hold. At at the place and the guy goes I forgot is not even busy. They didn't even offer a ice pop while I wait. This has the worse service ever."}
{"text":"The place was dead upon entering which should've been a warning to us. Didn't eat here but wanted Vietnamese ice coffee. Paid $10 (+tax and tip) for two coffee. It tasted bland, burnt, and bitter. I threw mine away. Been to many Vietnamese restaurants here in Arizona for coffee and it's usually really good but not here. The best I had was in phoenix where I paid $2.70 for coffee and it was quick and flavorful. Never coming back here!"}
{"text":"Excellent service! The food is awesome and the coconut water is all over the top! I've been here twice. There is a karaoke nite on Friday nite! Good prices and not complaints."}
{"text":"I walked down the street from my hotel on my way to a different restaurant and saw Pho, and decided to check it out. I love slightly dark,  understated very local looking spots and I couldn't resist. Man what a great call!! I walk in and my ears are hit with the melodious sounds of a saxophone jamming out on stage to some funky blues. Who would've guessed?!

I parked myself at a booth in front of the stage, had a Tsing Tao beer, and ordered some specials off the back page of the menu. The spicy spring rolls with pork were crispy fresh, and the hot clay pot of caramelized salmon hit the spot. When I was done, I couldn't leave for over an hour because the blues were just too damn good and my stomach was too happy. 

If you're in town on a Tuesday for the blues jam or any other night of the week craving some bomb Vietnamese food, hit this place up!"}
{"text":"Upon walking into Pho Cao I immediately felt the dive bar atmosphere as has been pointed out previously, with music playing a bit too loudly for my taste. However, it felt cool and the employees were really friendly, my server also knew his menu well. 

I ordered the Spider Crab Spring Roll (Goi Cuon Cua Lot), Fried Chicken Dumplings (Ha Cao Chien), and the Ramen Noodle Pho. The softshell crab was my favorite, felt really fresh and healthy. The ramen pho was also good, but nothing special. I was kinda disappointed over the dumplings, the consistency of the chicken was a bit bland and the overall dumpling was doughy. Finally, the price was kinda steep. Therefore I give the whole experience 3-stars.  

Although the food wasn't great, I would come back to one of their nightly events. As I wrote previously, the staff were friendly and I felt the atmosphere was cool. They organize open mic nights, karaoke, and have live performances. So that's definetly something to check out!"}
{"text":"Tasty salty beef broth with good portion and price. Unique ambience, might be the first pho bar restaurants with live music I've been to in my life. If you love pho, give this place a shot. I would eat here again."}
{"text":"Walked in, ordered drinks, apparently it was the owner working the bar, who then wandered off to the office. After 10 minutes, reordered again after I realized the owner wasn't coming back. Hung out for an hour,  went to close my tab, found out they gave my credit card to someone else...no apologies.  Spent the next 20 minutes outside on the phone with the bank canceling my card, came back in to tell my friends 'goodbye', at which point the owner called me over to give him another credit card to pay for my drinks they had no track of...wtf? Not making this up. 
I avoid writing bad reviews since service or food might be off for the night due to uncontrollable circumstances, acts of God, or someone is just having a bad day...but this interaction directly involved the owner, so there is no way to justify this. 
Enjoy your bad review and the $40 tab Pho Cao. If I could have given you negative stars and Worst Shithole of the Year, I would have...Avoid this shithole."}
{"text":"Food was okay, I would like to go back and order something else, wasn't a huge fan of my meal. 
Service was lukewarm, but they did have a live singer that night, so I was hoping it was due to the noise level."}
{"text":"I ate there one rainy day , not knowing what to expect. I pass by the location all the time. I was surprised that it's so big inside as well
As the stage they have inside! The nice waiter told me they have ladies night & karaoke nights . I was happy to hear that  and would bring my friends in! Now the food.... was delicious!!! The pho I got was large and I ate the left overs as a snack. I highly recommend this place!"}
{"text":"They have the BEST PHO. Little dive bar love it. They have live music I was there for lunch. Our server was fantastic too."}
{"text":"This place is very confused. It is a Vietnamese restaurant in a dirty dive bar setting, with a pool table and several flat screen TVs, and 60s music blasting in the background. My water was served in a faded Rebel IPA glass. The lighting was very odd and the place felt dark and sticky. There is also no way of looking into the restaurant from the outside, because the windows are covered and the doors have no windows.

Upon entering, a female server approached me and asked \"what's up?\"; when I told her I was dining in, she told me to sit anywhere. The male server I had appeared to be high and his speech was slurred and difficult to understand. There were only four other tables seated, but yet the two servers were literally running around the restaurant.

I ordered a pork chop combo (pork chop, rice, egg roll, fried egg, and chicken wings). The rice was wet and mushy and tasted like chlorine. The filling inside the egg roll tasted spoiled. Everything else was greasy and tasteless. I couldn't finish any part of my meal.  I ended up leaving and going to another restaurant down the block."}
{"text":"Pho with live blues playing was a bit odd.. I spent most of my time there look to see if John Tapper from Bar Rescue was going to walk in.. The food was average at best."}
{"text":"I happened to pass this place one day when I was participating in a charity walk.  We dropped in for dinner and I was craving some Pho.  After browsing the menu, we ordered:

Spring Rolls
http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/pho-cao-tempe-2?select=lUd3JVjBaaHNThXiRBWV5w#lUd3JVjBaaHNThXiRBWV5w

Pho Tai Chin (Lean Rare Steak, Well-done Brisket), $8
http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/pho-cao-tempe-2?select=Kb4rBGIA6-qis_DffjERXg#Kb4rBGIA6-qis_DffjERXg

The Spring Rolls were ok.  They were cooked properly with a nice, crisp shell.  However, they lacked flavor....were kind of bland.

The Pho Tai Chin was not good.  The noodles were clumped together at the bottom of the broth....hmmm, that means they were sitting around a while and then hot broth was poured on top of it.  It too lacked flavor.  Also, the Brisket was tough, not tender.  The Lean Rare Steak was good though.

The Wine was cheap and was also of poor quality.

Overall, this place was very disappointing.  The search for quality Pho in Phoenix continues....

Return Factor - 10%"}
{"text":"My Steak and brisket pho had about 6-8 pieces of 1.5\"x3\" paper thin pieces of meat.  It tasted awful without adding soy sauce and chile pepper sauce.  Lots of rice noodles though.  The peas were few, and were dry and sriveled as though they'd been freezer burned and thrown into the hot broth frozen.  So essentially, I paid 7.40 for 40oz of liquid with rice noodles that had been associated with some beef.  And the liquid was foul tasting.

The spring rolls were perfect.  They were obviously made in a factory and shipped frozen then deep fried at the restaurant.

We went on Sunday Night- open mic night.  There were lots of musicians, and two of them were talented.  Had we not already ordered an appetizer we would've left without eating.  Then we missed our second chance when the wait person (very nice, but unbelievably forgetful) forgot our order.  When they (I am trying to keep the person anonymous) returned to be reminded of the entrees we wanted, they had someone else's credit card, and had forgotten to return it to him.  We both ordered pho.  It's feaux pho, if you ask me.

Behind us sat a group of young men who lacked the vocabulary, self-control and courtesy to refrain from dropping an F-bomb in every sentence.  My wife and I suffered through our awful meal with this profinty laden cacophany of lousy music and loud drunken talking.

There are lots of great Asian options nearby, this one is very cheap.  But for a little more you can get some hearty and delicious Vietnamese food.  If you like this place, go to Miss Saigon in Tucson next time you're down that way.  But be warned: If you do, you'll never want to return to Pho Cao.  Or go to Totties, which is at the SW corner of Hayden and Thomas (about 2 miles from this joint).  Both have more authentic (and far more enjoyable) food, Totties has the nicer atmosphere.  I'm sure I could name quite a few others."}
{"text":"Good and friendly service. The food was ok, I think the meat didn't taste as fresh as I expected, it had this \"it's been frozen\" aftertaste. But overall it had a good seasoning. I would recommend it to friends. Three stars is good."}
{"text":"I would totally give Pho Cao 5 stars. Pho Cao has the best Pho that I've eaten so far. I'm originally from California where there are more Vietnamese people and Pho places but Pho Cao beats them all. Besides, the Chicken Curry and the Bun Bo Hue here are incredibly delicious. The service is amazing. The waiters and waitresses here are super friendly and always have a smile on their faces whenever them come serve you. Also the manager Victor Cao is very cool and responsible. He always goes around asking customers if the service is okay and if anything goes wrong, he will always make it up to customers. I usually come hang out here on the weekend when they open until late and do karaoke. This place is packed on the weekend. It's a good spot to hang out and get to know people.The manager always come hang out and chat with me and other customers by the bar."}
{"text":"The environment isn't your standard Vietnamese restaurant. It's kind of a dive bar which I think is kind of cool. Food here is really good. We came when they opened and they had some really good specials going on. We ordered their pho and it's really yummy. For a regular size is good enough for me. They have 2 bowl sizes. One is 40oz and 50oz. I felt full after an eggroll, potsticker, and pho. The egg rolls were really good but didn't like the sauce that much. Price wise wasn't bad but could be cheaper. Overall, I'll come again. Nice place!"}
{"text":"I am so thrilled about Pho Cao!

From the Vietnamese coffee to Thai iced tea with boba - I am a fan of the beverages as much as the fare.

The restaurant is housed inside a stand alone building (formerly Crazy Fish Sushi).  It is a large restaurant with a lounge and dining area.  There is also a separate space with a generous stage for its live music on Fridays and Saturdays after 7p.

A daily happy hour is also offered from 3p-6p and 11p-2a.  HH prices include 50% off all beers, well drinks, and wines.

Furthermore, there is Karaoke on Wednesdays and Thursdays. 

The menu offers 16 different bowls of Pho (beef based rice noodle soups).  All but 2 are beef steak or other beef varieties, so that limits the selections for vegetarians or chicken fans.  $6.75 regular $7.50 large

But there are many more plates and bites to try.  Start with an appetizer such as the soft spring rolls (Fresh rice paper rolls with shrimp & pork sausage served with peanut sauce), summer rolls (Fresh rice paper rolls with Vietnamese pork sausage, served with their house sauce), and soft shell crab spring rolls (Deep fried soft shelled crab rolled with lettuce, bean sprouts, avocado, and vermicelli, served with a special house mixed soy sauce).  Appetizers range from $4-$6, and we did try all three. Chicken wings and shrimp cocktail also available.

Entrees average $8-9.  Entrees are steamed rice with selections such as grilled salmon filet, grilled shrimp, or Chinese sausage.  Our order of the Com Ca Nuong (grilled salmon) was not a favorite as it was overcooked and very dry, but the curry more than made up for it!

One of their dozen \"Specials\" is the Cari Ga, or chicken curry.  This was a delicious green curry with marinated chicken, coconut juice, and carrots.  Add to that some fresh squeezed lime and cilantro, and it was perfect!

This restaurant certainly caters to the carnivorous crowd, but you will find some vegetable entrees such as the Vegetarian Curry, as well as stir fried rice and noodles - both of which can be ordered with seafood, pork, chicken, or tofu for $9.

Overall, with its simple and fresh ingredients and great prices - this is definitely going to become one of my go-to places."}
{"text":"The food is AMAZING here and the kitchen is open till closing, every day! The staff is incredibly friendly. Friday night karaoke is a party. They have a dedicated room for their music events, with professional stage, lights and sound system. Like their page on Facebook for their daily specials and events."}
{"text":"I am so happy Pho Cao opened right down the street from me.  Came in a few weeks ago and wasnt sure if they had opened yet.  They were still working on some construction inside but totally let me order Beef Pho (which I highly recommend) 
They could have told me they were closed and to piss off but they were awesome! 
Flavor was delicious and will be going back very soon... probably tonight because now i'm craving it. 

I am giving this 3 stars because its a little confusing where the front door is and the inside could use some work.  Definitely need to change the lighting and the layout.  It looks like they put tables around randomly, just looks a little more of a dive bar than vietnamese - but I go for the food.

Keeping the 3 star rating but totally bummed with my last experience. I love getting take out from here and placed an order Sunday for dinner and went to pick it up and they didn't have my order and were less than helpful or apologetic. They just kept asking if I was Stan ... Do I look like a Stan?

Update: Came here for dinner and they had their live music - OMG THIS WAS AWFUL.  They had the volume on the absolute highest volume and the people who were signing were actually awful and painful to listen to.  I could not have a conversation or even think.  I do like their broth and think they give a good portion of meat compared to a lot of other places but I will only ever get take out - DO NOT EAT INSIDE unless you want your ears to bleed."}
{"text":"If you want pho in Tempe go somewhere else! I ordered pho here and not only did it take 15 minutes to arrive--- I got the worst food poisoning I have had in years!!! I think they must have left the meat sitting out too long... Gross! Any of the pho places along Dobson are WAY better!"}
{"text":"Came here absolutely by accident a couple weeks ago. Cute place--looks like it used to be some totally random bar but has been hijacked into a Vietnamese place. 

We ordered vegetable and crab spring rolls, which were both delicious. 

I also ordered a banh mi, which confused the server--I had to repeat the order by menu number and say \"Vietnamese sandwich\". Come on, guy. 

Having lived in a couple of the best cities in the US for Vietnamese food, I have a kind of high bar for banh mi, but it isn't hard to give this one an objective review: the fillings were tasty but sparse--one of the great things about a banh mi is that it's a cheap but incredibly filling sandwich. This one was very light on the pork (which was otherwise very flavorful) and could have used a lot more of the pickled vegetable (which is cheap, so why skimp?). I'd also say that in Arizona of all places they could stand to make the pickle a little spicier; you won't scare an Arizonan away with heat and if I can get a hotter radish pickle in Minnesota, that's a problem. 

But the real issue with the sandwich was the bread. I could tell by looking at it that it wasn't right, and I could tell by tasting it that it was just plain wrong. Chewy, without the light crumb I'm used to in a banh mi. But it really wasn't until I got a bite without any filling that I realized the ultimate problem: the bread was sourdough! I can understand that the kitchen may not be equipped to bake traditional Vietnamese style baguettes, but a French-style sweet baguette should be easy to source in any major city and would be a much better substitute for the crackly, light-as-a-feather Vietnamese bread. 

I'm pretty sure if I were still a Tempe local that I'd be a regular here--I liked the ambiance a lot and I got a good vibe from the owner. But I hope our hapless server passed my message about the wrong, wrong, WRONG bread to the kitchen, and if he didn't, I hope that management reads this and recognizes that people really do notice when you get it right."}
{"text":"I enjoy their orange chicken and pho! At night they have live bands and karaoke. Staff is friendly. I like how when I do take out the food is always so hot. The only thing I didn't like is a couple times they've thrown the food in the bag and the orange chicken sauce was dumped all inside the bag. But other than that I enjoy their food and environment!"}
{"text":"I've driven by Pho Cao a bunch of times, and finally got to try it when we decided to get carry-out. I ordered the Surf and Turf pho, my s/o got the shaken beef, and my brother got the house fried rice. The pho was nothing special, though I did think it was cool that they gave me raw beef in a separate container from my soup (so it still cooked in my bowl at home). My s/o loved the shaken beef, and I also thought it was quite tasty. The house fried rice, on the other hand, was dry and the BBQ pork wasn't quite as fragrant as it usually is, so it was kind of a letdown.  

Obviously, take-out isn't the best way of judging a restaurant's food quality, so keep that in mind. We weren't in there for very long, but we really dug the vibes and definitely want to go back to hang out and give the food a second chance."}
{"text":"A great space where you can see a live band or sing karaoke as well as enjoy authentic Vietnamese cuisine.

Owner is passionate about what he is doing and makes sure everyone leaves satisfied. If you have any issue ask for Victor he will make it right.

Staff is super friendly and eager to help."}
{"text":"I sat here over 20 minutes before anyone asked me can I help you..... Bad customer service!"}
{"text":"I love this spot! I think I have reviewed but I have to mention again!  This is dive bar that has a Vietnamese feel, awesome musical performances and Vietnamese karaoke night! Amazing drinks and hands-down the best vegan Pho broth out there!!!
Always amazing and fast service!
Britney is the sweetest and most welcoming! Sage is amazing too! 
Thanks PhoCao !!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"Great happy hour prices on beer, great pho (for AZ), for some reason..... Lots of singles meet up nights and service can be better,."}
{"text":"Place was decent, lots of room, there is also a karaoke room and a bar, however the food felt a bit pricy for a Pho restaurant. It's awesome though that the restaurant is open till late so it's not bad to stop by for a late night dinner. Food was decent, nothing to write home about, but it could of been way worse.

The service was fine, he was a bit swamped due to a party going on at the exact same time, so I don't blame him at all. Overall pretty solid service, nothing to complain about in that department.

I probably will come back if i'm in the area and want a bowl of Pho."}
{"text":"I really wanted some pho the other night and decided to check this place out. I had seen it from the road a million times and thought I'd give it a try. I have to say, it wasn't really what I had expected. It wasn't terrible, but it was very far from good. The pho was okay, I got  the chicken. But I feel like they didn't give very much basil, lime, and jalapeño on the side. Portions were large which was good. My major issue with this place was the smell. OH THE SMELL. That smell was not a smell that belonged in a restaurant. There was something funky happening in there, and it was not good. In fact, it was very strong. I couldn't tell if it was garbage, or their cleaning solution they used on the table, but I was very close to just leaving when I first got there. (The only reason I didn't leave was because I was already there and starving.) It felt dirty too, but it was really dark in there so it was a little hard to tell. Could have been the smell that made me feel that way though. The music was really really loud too, I may just be being picky, but it could have been taken down a notch (or several). The service left a quite a bit to be desired, but wasn't the worst. I'm just very \"ehh\" about this place. If people were going and invited me, I'd go and probably wouldn't complain. If I were seeking out pho on my own, I think that I would definitely try somewhere else.


Now after reading the other reviews, I won't ever touch this place. I feel like I got lucky."}
{"text":"The spring rolls are well wrapped and taste great with the dipping sauce. The pho broth is very clean tasting, each bite is delicious. the smell inside gets your mouth watering and the ppl are all very nice."}
{"text":"Service:
I thought the server was overall friendly but not that attentive and definitely exaggerated everything I was considering on the menu. I gave a star for the friendly server.

Food:
Definitely overpriced and extremely small portions. First I ordered my absolute favorite meal: bun bo hue large ($10) and it was just OK. It is supposed to be spicy and filled with meat but this thing had a few meatballs and beef. It was a huge disappointment.

So still starving, decided to order Cao's Special Fried Rice ($12) because it's supposedly large. It came out dry AF and flavorless, and again very small quantity. It was probably a left over honestly. I really wanted to complain but didn't want to wait for another dish because I was already there alone for about 45 minutes and didn't want to cause trouble. 

Atmosphere:
Outdated

Conclusion:
Mind you, I am a 160lb dude who goes out to eat all the time at Vietnamese/Asian restaurants. I'm new to the area so I'm not sure if they're the only ones in town. If they are, I'm going to be sad not being able to get Viet food for a while."}
{"text":"One of the best tasting phos in the Valley!  Very flavorful and abundant choices on the fillings - from tripe to tendon, flank, steak, meatballs, and so on.  Just the right ration of noodles to broth and veggies available upon request.  

Very weird music selection (in a good way) - 80's and 90's music that seems odd in a Vietnamese place, but no complaints here.

The minus 1 star is for the hit-and-miss service.  Sometimes you get a decent waiter.  Other times you get a stoner that messes up almost everything on your order.  Be more selective in your hiring and you get the full five stars from me."}
{"text":"Don't waste your time ordering from BeyondMenu (to order take out online). Apparently the manager doesn't train the staff on how to see that online orders have been placed and paid for, so when you arrive you will have to order, and pay, again. Which really makes ordering take out online a very efficient process. 

Why even have an online system if it only works when one specific employee is on site?"}
{"text":"a fantastic place. the bahn mi sand which with pork was great. the crispy spring rolls with chicken and pork was phenomenal. great restaurant good prices and great food. A+"}
{"text":"Okay, so I finally get to this. After experiencing the \"basement\" of past Pho Cao, I was so happy to see they have moved on up to the Northeast side. The night we went they had live music, the Pho was good, and the service shined. I wish people wouldn't bring their screaming toddlers to places that serve a lot of alcohol. The place was loaded with whiners and criers. But food was good and that's why we came."}
{"text":"Having lived, at one time, a few blocks from DaVang in Phoenix,my standards are high. My complaints about this restaurant are purely subjective. First of all, place was empty at 6 pm. Uh oh. Looks like a frat boy's basement bar. Messy and disorganized, smells like a frat house carpet the day after the big game. I am still forgiving at this point because we all know that a good Vietnamese restaurant is very sparse in the decorating department. Well, then came the food. We got several different soups. And I tried the spring rolls. My comments... okay, the broth was WAY too heavy on the cloves. I mean overpowering. Pho should have broth that is aromatic but undecipherable. The basil was dried and old, and NO CILANTRO!!! SO BAD!! SO we order some and get a sprig. Spring rolls passable but the peanut sauce was watery and tasteless. I became worried about  my heath at this time. SO unless you are looking for $2 PBRs at happy hour after the ASu games, needing Pho to sober you up before dodging Scottsdale police, If you want good Pho go to DaVang, Pho Thahn, Nam Sau, or Avina. NO SOUP FOR YOU!!! here."}
{"text":"Not the best pho. Buttt the bright side is it is open late and is he only pho restaurant around phx metro area open till 2am on some nights. I don't like that it is a pho bar because associating cigarette smell with your pho is kinda off putting. The staff has always been super nice though."}
{"text":"Decided to try this place on a whim, and it ended up being pretty damn good. Flank, tripe, meatballs, round eye...lots of jalapenos and sriracha. Good stuff. Springs rolls were good too! It's a bit of a dive, but I'm sure it gets lively at times. Only place I've seen in the area (admittedly, I haven't really looked) with pho...I'm sure I'll be back."}
{"text":"This place is extremely disappointing. We live right down the street and we wanted to try something different since we always go to China Wok. The rice is over fried and the spring rolls were not good. This place is very overpriced and it's just not good at all. Should have just went to China walk."}
{"text":"The bar is in our neighborhood so we took a walk over on a Saturday night. It happened to be their one year anniversary so we got free Corona lighted lime necklaces. How festive! It was immediately apparent that our waitress was not experienced or competent. She got our appetizer order wrong but made it right by taking one item off the bill. They only serve red wine, it's a beer drinking crowd! The food was good but nothing to write to mother about."}
{"text":"Pho Cao is like 2 minutes from Red Lion Inn & Suites where my family stayed for the night.   My mom didn't feel well from a 6 hours drive from Orange County. So she want Pho to hopefully help her feel better. We got to Pho Cao @ 9:30pm on a Tuesday night. The place has lots of students from the nearby college. The owner, I think, come & greed us & speak Vietnamese to my mom. He is very nice & was very glad to see Vietnamese customer in the restaurant. This is the first Pho restaurant we went to which has a full bar & band. It is really weird, but on second thought it is not weird for it is next to the college. Hey college students love Pho & alcohol so it is a perfect combination & it is the owner great ideal to offer both. The Pho was really good. My niece, nephew, & mom clean the bowl (see pictures). My mom said the pho is really good & it does help her feel better. Thanks Pho Cao."}
{"text":"I really want to love this place, but I have had much better Pho elsewhere. Staff wasn't fully trained. I specifically asked for NO tripe, yet it was included in my dish. This location has potential, but needs to work out the kinks before I return."}
{"text":"Pho is fantastic and service is great! Chicken pho had big juicy chunks and the spring rolls were yummy. Linda our waitress was so nice and attentive!"}
{"text":"I came here for lunch and loved it.   Loved the music, free wifi, friendly and quick service and delicious Pho.  I got a giggle out of a white guy serving me PHO, but I'd definitely come back.  I could sit here and work on my laptop all day."}
{"text":"This place is everything a pho joint is supposed to be and then some! Let's start with the basics: It's cheap! You can get a bowl of pho for 6-8 bucks depending on how hungry you are. It's also the real deal! They have tendon and tripe for all you sickos out there that are actually into that. Just give me a piping hot bowl with beef, brisket and a ton of Sriracha, I'm a happy guy! We also tried the shaking beef because everyone rants and raves about it and it's only $9.95.. It was heaven in the form of little filet mignon cubes! We just happed to get here during happy hour and were pleasantly surprised with half priced draft beers!

The sign out front advertises live music and karaoke some nights of the week, adding a nice element of entertainment! Add to that the fact that they serve food late into the night, and you've got yourself a nice little spot! I can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"I've ordered number one with rice noodle today and when I got home and opened it they used a ramen noodle. The one u buy in the store for 25 cent very dissapointed. One star for ontime delivery."}
{"text":"great customer service. I ordered the eggrolls it was good. SECOND I ordered number one it was great also... the only thing I didnt like is the sewer smell..."}
{"text":"I REALLY REALLY wanted to love this place. Two stars is being kind. The location has been empty for year and as a Pho aficionado, I was so supper excited to see this place opening in my neighborhood. I do understand that during my visit, they were still trying to work out some kinks, which is always to be expected of new restaurants. However, it was way unorganized. When I walked in you immediately see a large bar right in front of you (which is where all the employees seemed to be). There was no hostess in the hostess area, so I just went to the bar. I wanted to order food to go and let a server know this. I sat for 20 min before even getting a menu, waited another 10 min for someone to take my order, and another 20 min for my actual food. Meanwhile I sat at the bar while an employees complained loudly amongst themselves about all the work they had to do that day. I stayed because I hoped the food would make up for it all. The answer is, it did not. I  ordered House Pho, dumplings, egg rolls, and fried rice. All the non soup items were very greasy and lacked seasoning. The pho too was under seasoned and my noodles were gummy.  I might give this place another shot an a few more months and a few more reviews to allow them some time to get things going."}
{"text":"Some friends of ours invited us to celebrate NYE at Pho Cao. There were quite a few people, but it was not completely packed, which I enjoyed. We sat at the bar, and I admit, I didn't explore the rest of the building much, other than the women's restroom, which was decently clean. 

We ate before we drank, so my thoughts on the food is completely sober. I really wanted to try the pho, but knowing I'd be drinking for the next several hours, I knew I needed something more carb-loaded. Husband ordered the Shaken Beef, which was chunks of super tender beef, stir fried with garlic, onions and green peppers, served with rice. It was delicious. I ordered a stir fry noodle dish with egg noodles, chicken and veggies. Also delicious. Portion sizes are very generous.

The bar is fairly stocked, with several beers on tap. Other than my husband drying out the Kiltlifter keg, drinks were perfect. The two bartenders were great, as well. Friendly and attentive.

Our food and who-really-knows-how-many drinks with a mandatory gratuity was something like $130. Completely reasonable to ring in the new year with great people.

We will definitely make the ~40 mile trek from home to dine here with friends again!"}
{"text":"Love this place!! The pho is amazing very affordable and who else has love music on Monday! Discovered this place thanks to a group I paddle on the marina. First came on a Thursday and they had kareoke.  Great time.  Servers are awesome and so attentive! Clean. But the best part is the food! You won't be disappointed. I don't drink alcohol but the do have a full bar as well."}
{"text":"This is my new go to Pho restaurant. The food is great I usually get the Pho w/ meatballs and rare steak and the crispy egg rolls. I love karaoke so I usually come when they have it on Thursday nights. The kj Phil is really good. The bartender Shaun and owner Victor are really fun too. I went last night and about to go again tonight :) it really has a nice neighborhood bar feel."}
{"text":"I had a bartender follow me out on Friday night and accuse me of not tipping and continued to question why I didn't. Which I did! I had tipped her 20%. I honestly do not wish to go back because of the way she had treated us. Thanks again!"}
{"text":"Eh. Nothing special. Food wise. Got the shrimp pho and spicy spring rolls.  Soup was bland and not that much noodles esp for the price. Bf got the #2 and also agrees that the soup was boring. For the side veggies, they were out of the cilantro and other leafy veggie that I like.   

Spicy spring rolls- they were a dollar more than the regular spring rolls. Said they had sriacha and jalapeño. Took a chance and well, all it was was a regular sprig roll with a jalapeño in it. Have no clue where the sriacha was. Not to mention the MIA green onion was that normally comes with. You're better off getting the regular ones and adding your own sriacha and jalapeño and saving a dollar. 

The only good thing was the server-he was attentive. 
All in all disappointed. The menu seems authentic but is the pho and spring rolls are any indication, then I'd say its a flop. That and being in a karaoke bar is just weird.  Where's the large big screen tv playing overly loud Vietnamese reality talent shows instead?"}
{"text":"I was torn between four and five stars. For some reason I expected a place that looked all nice and beautiful on the inside and the food would be mediocre. But it was the exact opposite. When I walked into the place I was surprised how plain it was and almost resembled a dive bar.

But then everything changed. Our server was very good with the menu and had several recommendations and was extremely helpful.  The food was very tasty and the pineapple fried rice was outstanding.  

It will probably end up being one of my go to places because the price was right for outstanding food.. I'm not as concerned about the cheap bar decor. It was just a bit of an odd experience."}
{"text":"Great Pho! Nice sweet beef broth and those perfect rice noodles. If you'd had Pho before tho, nothing exceptional here. Just a good bowl of soup. I got the Surf and Turf and it was very fresh and tastey. I got it to go so I can't speak on the service. But I heard a guy yell out \"This was Excellent!\" as I was leaving. 
I agree."}
{"text":"This place rocks for cao! I've been here a few times now for the food and the Karaoke. The spring rolls are unique, they rock. I usually get the bun with extra meat and an extra spring roll. I love the people here, they are all really nice. It's just a really fun place to hang out. Definitely some pro karaoke goers here, but they don't mind the amateurs having a great time. Service has always been top notch!"}
{"text":"I wanted to try this place because my cousin's band has played here before and I thought it would be good because he played there regularly. They never answer their phone for takeout, finally they did months later and I was able to place an order. I got the vegetarian curry for 9.99 and it came with a total of three pieces of tofu, three pieces of potato, and three carrots. Other people weren't joking around about how badly they skimp on the food. The potato and carrot tasted very mushy and soggy, almost like it was super old and from some leftover stew or something and had been sitting out all day.

     Overall the curry was very bad and probably the worst I've had in the area, for the same price I can get a real curry down the street. The garlic noodles were very stale/dry and stuck together and smelled like mushrooms too. I asked for thai tea and they said there wasn't any ready. So what, you can't brew more? I'm thankful I don't eat meat either, because a lot of people report getting food poisoning from here. I won't be eating here again, it's disgusting and they're clearly so greedy they can't spare more than three pieces of tofu for a basic vegetarian dish. I did not go in myself, but the person who did said it looked like a filthy dive bar and smelled really musty."}
{"text":"I've had this place bookmarked for awhile, but it took a coworker's ravings for the pho here for me to finally drop in and see what it's all about.  (He told me that the owners are coworkers from another department.)  I read a couple of yelp friends' reviews, and I agree with Kay T.'s opinion that the restaurant is a dive bar.  Upon entering the place, I was disappointed to see that it really was a dive bar, but I wasn't surprised to find the atmosphere as it is, since another coworker's attempt at owning a bar (this was ten years ago) had the same atmosphere.  It's just a place where people can go after work, still in their black undershirts and black pants, and get a buzz on, or get wasted.  Thankfully, the steak pho I tried here was delicious!  $7.50 for the regular-size bowl, plus add $2.50 for tendon option.  I could even order veggies (bok choy, broccoli, carrot, and something else; important thing is that one may ask for any of these ingredients omitted-- great for those with food allergies!) for an extra $2.  For drink options, the Thai iced tea was too pricey ($4, and the restaurant didn't have any to sell), and an order of Vietnamese coffee was $5 (!!).  So far, this dive served food and Asian beverages sounded a little pricey for a place I hadn't tried, yet, so I just went with pho and added tendons.  The side dish of sprouts, sprigs of cilantro and mint, and lime arrived first, and seeing how small it was, I knew that the bowl with also be smaller than I'm used to.  And it was, but oh, so tasty!  The slices of steak was tender; a nice amount of tendon cuts added more textures; and a good amount of egg noodles.  I must preface that I'd skipped the second \"meal\" I'd normally have at work in order to have room for this pho meal, so perhaps I was so hungry, anything would taste great.  All I can report is that this is the very first bowl of pho where I ate everything- steak pieces, all of the sprouts on that side dish, egg noodles, AND tendon pieces!  The only thing left was a bit of soup.  Had that soup not been so salty, I probably would've consumed half of what was eventually left over...  Afterwards, I did feel that the soup had a LOT of sodium in it, and my face felt swollen, so I think the broth may even have MSG in it, and if Pho Cao uses MSG, I won't be able to return for a second tasting.

Based on that first bowl of pho, I would like to take my mom here, since she also enjoys a great bowl of pho.  (We'll just split a large order.)  She's a lot tougher a judge than me, though, since she knows how much it costs to make a broth meal (food shopping, costs, and preparation time).  I just know that upon seeing and feeling the ambiance of the place, she will ask me to take her somewhere else-- I don't blame her, I almost left without dining here myself!  If I'm right about the MSG, I won't have a reason to return.

The female bartender that served me was friendly, and the male server that handled the one table I saw occupied was, as well.  Happy hour is served from 3p to 6p.  I didn't ask if there was reverse happy hour.  Given the area, though, I wouldn't want to be there that late in the evening."}
{"text":"Here's the thing... We can't stop coming here because the Pho is delicious and band that plays on Tuesday nights is so awesome! The service is about as bad as it gets... So if you're huge on getting service within 19 minutes of being sat, or your server knowing about specials, or what they have... Then skip it. But if your patient and like Pho and blues music check it out on a Tuesday!"}
{"text":"This is the best pho for such a great price! I love the spicy tamarind broth. The other crazy thing is they have live music and karaoke and such things, making it a very unique pho joint! Shoutout to Lucas who took care of us today. Today was my third time. And my first time being taken care of by Lucas. He was super attentive and knowledgeable about the menu! He was just all around a genuinely awesome and gave fantastic rare service. Cheers!"}
{"text":"I'm extremely forgiving (check out my other reviews--I'm the picture of positivity), but I'm seriously wondering if to-go orders here are filed away in the garbage can. The pho and food are good, the problem is the service. If my order is messed up the first time--ok, it wasn't a great night. Second time--oops--maybe they're training new people? Three times? WTF is happening? Do you hate me? I went to pick up my order after 45 minutes and found out that it had never been submitted. Yikes. You just can't phock with hangry people like that."}
{"text":"Went here with a Groupon, and tried a few items on their menu.  I liked the wide selection of different spring rolls, and decided on the soft shell crab spring roll ($6) since I love soft shell crab.  The roll tasted decent, but nothing spectacular.  The same could be said for the salted fish and shrimp fried rice I had as an entree ($9.50).  It was a basic fried rice.  I was surprised to see that the \"salted fish\" was actually finely meshed bits of fish integrated within the rice as if it were a seasoning for the rice.  Although it just tasted OK, the portions of rice and shrimp were sizeable. My friend had the #2 pho bowl, which was a very large portion, but for her it wasn't too remarkable.

The atmosphere here is kind of dark and uninviting.  It seems like there are some renovations that need to be done too, since there was a big leak dripping down the ceiling onto the booth right behind us.  

Service was mixed.  Our main server, while friendly, was very awkward and wasn't very knowledgeable about the menu.  We weren't served any plates to go with our spring roll appetizers, and I had to specifically ask for napkins since there weren't any at the table or any given to us.  The server that refilled our waters and sodas was very nice and promptly gave us refills as needed though.  The soda I had, a diet cola (Not sure if it was Coke or Pepsi, $1.75) tasted very watered down, with not enough carbonation or syrup.  

There was only one real dessert item on the menu, a Vietnamese style flan ($2.50), which was decent.  It had a nice creamy texture, surrounded by coffee flavored syrup and had ice cubes on top of it.  

With the plethora of other Vietnamese restaurants in the Tempe/Chandler area, this will probably only be a place I will frequent if the other restaurants are closed and I'm craving Vietnamese late at night, since they are open very late for the last half of the week."}
{"text":"Went here for lunch during the work week. My friend and I split an order of spring rolls - delicious, and then I ordered the pho tai - DELICIOUS! I'm a total pho snob and this pho was yummy. They were also very quick to bring our food out. Beware, this isn't a normal Vietnamese restaurant you think of when going to get pho, it is more of a bar atmosphere and was pretty dark inside - that would probably be my only negative thing to say about it, however that could be a very positive thing for someone else and I'm sure it makes for great ambiance if going at night or on the weekend."}
{"text":"Great food and live music! Beer selection is just ok, but menu has many great choices. Gets pretty loud if you're not into live music. Definitely recommend!"}
{"text":"Food was good as usual. I have been here many times and will be back. Salmon rolls were great and so was the fried rice with shrimp, bbq pork, and Chinese sausage, except there was only three shrimp, overcooked, with the tail on. I really don't enjoy having to dig into my dish to remove the tails and they were hard to cut with a fork being over done. My friend had shrimp fried rice with more shrimp in it and spent the first five minutes of his meal doing the work the kitchen should've done to be able to enjoy his meal. Also no knives served with it to cut them. But that's not why I only gave it three stars, but it was our server too. We usually get great service from two particular servers who I will not name, but this time we got someone else. He failed to offer us drinks, which we did want an alcoholic drink before the meal waiting for for our appitizers, but we were only offered water. On top of that our food came out in two dramatic shifts instead of being timed better, although that could be the server, the two dishes were the fried rice which hold well and he could have made the delivery better. I had to get my own napkins from the bar and take a condiment tray from another table because he failed to bring one or to do the two bite/two minute check on our table. No, it wasn't busy, it was karaoke night and later in the evening so most people weren't eating. One friend had to stop him to order his drink but it had to be refilled but had to stop another server for a refill. Will be back, he will not be our server."}
{"text":"I'm surprised this place isn't as frequented by Tempeans as it should be. We came in on a Saturday night just after an ASU football game. We ordered spring rolls to start and they were excellent. For our main course we ordered the pho. I got mine with well-done beef brisket and my husband got beef as well as tripe. We both enjoyed our orders very much. The service was friendly. We'll be back!"}
{"text":"Amazing pho!! Friendly staff! The only reason I gave it one less star is because the band that was playing was soooo loud that my boyfriend and I couldn't hear each other from across the table. I also have slight hearing issues and it gave me a headache, but if their Amps had been turned down just a little bit it would have been much more enjoyable. Also was confused when we walked in because there wasn't a sign saying seat yourself or wait to be seated... a nice woman came in from outside and then told us we can have a seat wherever. Other than those two minor set backs, it was the best pho we have had!"}
{"text":"As a self-described pho affectionado, I'll say that this place doesn't have the greatest soup ever.  Don't bother getting carry out, because they will cut down the meat portions to almost nothing which is a bit irritating.  Not only that, but they seem to consistently get my order completely wrong if I call it in.  I suspect it's due to the loudness of the place, but it's still not excusable at all.

I'd say if you want to hang out, drink beer, sing karaoke, and otherwise treat it like a bar, it would be fine, but for a great Vietnamese meal you should look elsewhere."}
{"text":"I enjoyed this place so much! I went with my girlfriend to this place last night and we really enjoyed it because there was a LIVE performance by a few local artists. Very simple."}
{"text":"Food was delicious but the after effects not so much. Both my son and I had nasty bubble guts. Shoulda stuck to my usual Pho place."}
{"text":"I've seen several restaurants turn over in this location several times.  It's a high traffic area, but kind of isolated from everything else, and you can't make a left onto Scottsdale Road when exiting the parking lot.  I give them six months, but more because of the location than anything else.

It has a spacious feel and a lot of Chinese touches (e.g., the placemat has the Chinese zodiac) for a Vietnamese restaurant.  And it looks like they want to have a vibrant bar scene at night.  They are open till 2 am, although pho can only be ordered till 10 pm.  We came on our lunch break to give it a try.

I got the large pho with the rare steak and lean beef, or something like that.  There were over a dozen combinations of meats for pho.  I got the large bowl because I'm usually hungry after three hours of having pho for lunch.  The large portion did a fairly good job of lasting me through the rest of the day.  The meat was of relatively higher quality compared to other pho places I've been to in the city.  Overall, I would say that it was good."}
{"text":"Pretty good! Hit the spot! super friendly. Bonus egg rolls or potstickers. Bonus drink. Vietnamese ice coffee was strong and perfect."}
{"text":"I got the large P5 spicy and it was great! I'm a big fan of Pho. The only place that beats this place is SHADY PARK on Mill Ave in Tempe. 

The reason I gave this place a 4 star is because the interior definitely needs an update. Looks like a dive bar and then some lol. Other then that food and service was on point!! 

I most definitely will eat here again!"}
{"text":"I used to go to a Pho place on the West side of town all the time with my father when he was still alive. Pho Bang. That place was a family business and remained my favorite Pho joint for years. I took dates there and it was one of my go-to little hidden spots to recommend and take friends to for years. Over time, they started going a bit down hill I think. The food didn't seem to change much, but after awhile it was apparent that they were in need of a fresh coat of paint or new chairs and tables or something. 

Anyway, long story short - I eventually sorta stopped going there and I didn't really realize how much I missed having a good Pho place to hit up once in awhile. That brings me to Pho Cao. This is the building that used to be Crazy Fish 202 Sushi. I think it was even something before that I can't remember. The parking lot is awkward to get to, and if you miss the turn you may be inclined to just give up and go somewhere else rather than turn around and go back. Well, don't. This place is worth it. 

It has only been open less than a week, but they've already made massive changes to the building and if you've been here before, you're in for a pleasant surprise as they've clearly put in a lot of work. There are still a few little kinks to be worked out as they are so new, but that's pretty standard at any new place. The owner and staff are super nice and enthusiastic. I love supporting local businesses when it's clear they love what they are doing - and that shows here.

Now the food... is it as good as my favorite Pho? Well, I would definitely have to put their rolls up there with the best of them. I ordered a second plate of Egg Rolls (which are called Spring rolls at the other place) after finishing the first if that tells you anything. They mixed up my order a bit for my entree and brought out something that was similar to what I ordered, but a totally different item. It was a simple mistake, but they were good about offering to correct it.

I opted to eat it anyway rather than send it back. I plan on trying a bunch of things there, and I'm not a stickler for such things. The waitress was attentive and quick to bring drink refills. My entree was good, and I tried my gf's Pho and thought that was mighty tasty as well. The tea she ordered was amazing - the little beads of boba reminded me of that Orbitz drink that was discontinued years ago. If you're feeling nostalgic, there you go... 

I had a good time, and I'm looking forward to going back. They have great food. They are close to my house too which is a plus. They have a full bar and plan to do live music and other fun stuff. They also plan to start delivering soon I believe which is awesome. We need more delivery places in town. It's close to ASU and Old Town Scottsdale - such a great location.

By the way - I found out it's pronounced FUH and not foe. After all these years doing it wrong. I may just keep saying it wrong."}
{"text":"My favorite place for spring rolls! The pho is yummy too. I usually prefer to get take out."}
{"text":"Ok. So I just left this place and I must say the atmosphere is amazing and the music is great. They are also open late, which is wonderful because I stay up late! 

Unfortunately, their main point is lacking: the food itself. The broth was basically onion water and no amount of hoisin or Sriracha would make it better. And I swear that was mint and not basil.... I just think they don't know much about Vietnamese food. They should switch to something else. I have never not finished a bowl of pho. Ever. I also never pause when I'm eating it. Lol.  But this bowl was hard to get through and I didn't even make it all the way. 

The service also was not great. We waited like 20 min before our order was even taken. And when the waitress came to take it, she walked up and just looked at me with an expressionless face. Awkward. I ordered, and it took like another hour to even get just my pho out(which should only take 10 min), and another 10 min for my boyfriend's rice. He was disappointed too. 11 dollars for something so small. Didn't even taste like the Vietnamese dish. Anyway, we felt ignored all night and the waitress was awkward and emotionless. 
I usually tip pretty well because I work in the food service industry as well, but I just couldn't tip well. :/ I'm sorry."}
{"text":"When we decided to get Pho at 8:59pm we sadly found out that every single Vietnamese restaraunt closes at nine. Well almost all Viet restaurants, the one place that stays open late is Pho Cao which is open til 2am. (Does Pho Cao get it's name from the great general Cao Cao? We will never know)

On to the food 

Pho Tai (Small) $7
 - A little pricier then other neighborhood joints
 - A lotta broth
 - Not much meat or noodles 

Cha Gio (4 Imperial Rolls) $5.50
 - Just your typical Imperial Roll
 - Pork, carrots, vermicelli
 - Not bad, not amazing

They have great live music! I thought it was karaoke people at first and thought dayum their pretty good.... then I realized these weren't your typical amateurs~ 

Overall come for the ambiance and flexibility of Pho Cao's hours and you wont come away dissatisfied."}
{"text":"Amazing Bar and Vietnamese Pho! Love that your first visit you can get 50% off your first alcoholic drink too! I have been quiet often for lunch but have yet to try to weekends when it is open till 2am. I plan on trying it in the near future to how well their service and bartenders are. P.S PHO here is delicious and their egg rolls."}
{"text":"Pho is authentic and you almost feel like you are in Vietnamese here. The food is good, many selections and if you don't want to be at the club but wanna hear club and old school music, come friday nights where its DJ Nights and the DJ's be turnt up!"}
{"text":"Walked in and saw/heard karaoke...absolutely just took this from a 4 star to a 5 star. Pho with spicy tamarind broth was excellent, comes with massive amount of sides and vegetables were incredibly fresh. Wasn't expecting to have a good local pho place down the street, but I'll now be back for sure"}
{"text":"I have a history with this place. I have been here when it was just a Vietnamese Restaurant. I have been here when it was a Vietnamese restaurant and nightclub (lol?) and now I have been there when it is just a Vietnamese bar and restaurant! One thing that has been consistent all through though is the amazing pho they have here :) and the last time I was there, they told me they even have the veggie broth pho now, which I never had here before because they never had it before :) and let me tell you it tasted way way way better than all the other broths they have here. The service is kind of meh, with some of the servers even rude, but well just keep your fingers crossed. They have good ice tea as well and have some weird smoothies as well. They have an avocado smoothie lol. I had it last time, and I now I think they may have used some powder to make it (not sure if they would have used real avocados?). I dont remember if they had drink specials though?"}
{"text":"I am not really into Pho, but we go here exclusively for the karaoke.Try the steak with onions and garlic. The wings suck though. The bartender is pretty good and they always have Fireball shot specials. Karaoke night is the best night to go with KJ Mike. We always have a great time."}
{"text":"Cool little spot. Went with friends on a Thursday night for some pho and had a wonderful time. I had immediate flashbacks when pulling into the parking lot. Took me back about 10 years to when it was a hookah bar. Time flies. Fast. The food is good; I am new to the pho/ramen thing and am loving every single minute. Delicious.
Thursday night is karaoke night. Fun times. Of course there are the few show offs, just like it is at any karaoke night. But who am I to judge them for spending their whole entire week prepping for this? Hog that mic dude singing Whitney Houston, I'm not drunk enough anyway. ;)"}
{"text":"I've been to several Vietnamese restaurants in my day. You can't top California and Minnesota when it comes to traditional Vietnamese food.

So far, I've been to one place to serves decent spring rolls and pho. Unfortunately, that one place is not Pho Cao Restaurant and Bar.

Let's start with the pho, the dish by which all Vietnamese restaurants are judged. Their broth was not piping hot, which is a necessity for pho broth. On top of that, the broth had way too much star anise.

The cuts of meat were decent, I got my order at 11pm and didn't feel like I was getting the last of the beef slices (which can happen from time to time at these places).

I had to load up on hoisin, sriracha and lime to make the dish work for me.

The spring rolls were ok. Nothing to write home about, but not bad either.

Where this place really differs is that it has a full bar and attempts to meld Vietnamese dining with karaoke bar (think Geisha a-go-go). 

All in all, I would not go back here unless it was late at night or I was in the mood for cocktails after some pho."}
{"text":"There's nothing like a piping hot bowl of pho! My favorite thing on the menu is definitely the steak and meatball pho. I get it every time I come here along with the spring rolls. 

Great atmosphere and a good staff. I've been here several times now and can say that wont change anytime soon. The food always comes out fairly quickly and never disappoints! I love that this place has a bar and has a fairly decent drink menu with good prices. Sake bombers are a must, I always get them when I come here. 

Perfect location for a weekend date or just to catch up with friends. Don't pass this place up, it will not disappoint!"}
{"text":"Atmosphere is cool , they had a band.
Felt bad for our waitress ,seemed understaffed.
Food came out quickly and was deliciouuuuuus We ordered the pineapple fried rice and ramen pho. Definitely recommend  , would like to come on a Thursday for karaoke night"}
{"text":"This restaurant has remarkable good food and we enjoy the convenience of takeout. We've tried crispy and spring rolls and a few varieties of pho. Very tasty, worth coming back for..."}
{"text":"We ate here for the first time today. I was not happy. In fact, all I can think about is how I'd like nothing more then to have my $60.00 back. We usually eat china wok but wanted to try something else. The fried rice was over fried, didn't taste fresh at all. The egg rolls weren't good. We had pot stickers and a spring roll as well. Overall I was very unhappy. I'll stick to my usual spot next time, the food is better and so is the price."}
{"text":"Everything was surprisingly good I don't like pho but I was pleasantly surprised when I had theirs they also have really good spring rolls I will return servers were excellent and very kind and help me decide what to order"}
{"text":"It was good enjoyed the pho and it was a little to quite for my taste.. would like some music.. but was awesome enjoyed lunch here.."}
{"text":"Great choice for Pho!  I swear the wait staff has been different every trip, and the last guy was horrible..  But everyone else has been great, so I'll write off the last experience as a fluke."}
{"text":"Be careful of what you order because everything is cooked in the same wok. 

I'm actually really disappointed. I read so many good reviews about this place that the food was phenomenal. But when we showed up and inform the waitress that my date has a terrible allergy to shrimp and asked if there was anyway to have her meal prepared in a way that there was no cross contamination. We were informed that wasn't possible. 
We asked about the vegan broth, but were informed that everything goes all in the same wok so cross contamination was going to happen. 

You even advertised that if you had a food allergy to let the wait staff know and they will accommodate your needs. This didn't happen and we had no other option but to leave and go some place else. 

Frankly I'm just straight up perplexed and disgusted at the casual disregard for people with any type of food allergy."}
{"text":"I work late sometimes and I have a hard time finding a place that will cater to the night owl such as myself. 

Pho Cao was convenient and stayed open late. Their menu was vast and delicious. Darina, or waitress, was on point with making sure our experience was the best that it could be. She made sure our drinks were filled and our empty plates cleared.

Their Pho was great being seasoned to perfection. 

I will be visiting this place more and broaden my palate with the rest of their menu."}
{"text":"The food is consistently good. The staff is friendly and attentive. The live music on Sunday's is entertaining. If I didn't live an hour away, I'd come more often. Love this place."}
{"text":"Attention Gluten Free'ers... This place is a paradise for those of us consuming a sans gluten diet. That said, the food was amazing the service was outstanding and did I mention almost EVERYTHING is GLUTEN FREE. The broth they use for the Pho is spectacular. We all had something different and dish after dish; pork, steak, shrimp, and vegetarian just kept getting better. Please make your palate happy and eat at Pho Cao."}
{"text":"This is by far my favorite Pho place in all of Scottsdale and Phoenix! I had the ramen Pho and it was perfect this is the only place that I heard of that offers ramen noodles in pho broth. I have had a lot of Pho and the broth here is fantastic. Basil, lime, sprouts, onions, and cilantro were so fresh it looks like they picked the herbs right before they sent it out the door. Awesome customer service and the food was delivered hot and 30min before expected. Thank you to Pho Cao and doordash for an amazing experience!"}
{"text":"Excellent food, I order out a lot and they always get it right. It's alittle pricey but it's the best! Always  fun to see the live bands when we have the time and not on the take out \"go\". Thanks again!"}
{"text":"Best ramen soup for the price anywhere. Highly recommend. I'm addicted to this place."}
{"text":"This place took my Pho virginity... and it was good.

I was initially excited when I sat down by the awesome playlist of old school hip hop playing in the background- it instantly put me in a good mood. The owner visited with us, and made some suggestions as this was my first time having Pho. I started with some spring rolls that they made to be vegetarian that tasted AMAZING. Perfect peanut sauce, and they replaced the meat with avocado and tofu. The taste hit the spot. 

Next, I opted for veggie pho, which I was a little disappointed to find out that it was still a beef broth base, but I tried it anyway and it was delicious. They served it with a side of fresh bean sprouts, mint and a lime. So many different flavors, yet they all complimented one another.

I treated myself to a Thai iced tea, which honestly was one of the best I've ever had. Sweet, but without the smokey aftertaste that some Thai teas can have (which I hate- so I don't always order them). It came with some boba which was a fun addition.

 I really hope this place does well, as the food, service and atmosphere were all great. I hear they are thinking about doing karaoke and I totally hope they do. I'll be back!"}
{"text":"I came here for lunch with a friend. I ordered their Pho Gah. The atmosphere is similar to a dive bar atmosphere, not your typical Pho place. I read other reviews ahead of time saying this but took the chance since the first Pho option we wanted was closed. 

When we walked in a server/hostess told us to sit anywhere we'd like. Every booth seemed to have an empty glass or finished plate (about 3 or 4 empty booths like this) besides those currently occupied. We opted for a two person table instead. One of our chairs was sticky and so was the menu. 

The food itself was ok. I judge Pho by the chicken, this chicken seemed liked it was canned and not fresh. They do serve coconuts though, if you are thirsty or Jasmine tea. That is if you don't want alcohol from the bar. I ordered tea, but I didn't realize they planned on bringing it cold when I prefer hot. Though, I wasn't asked a preference either way. 

I would eat here again, it's just not my first choice for Pho."}
{"text":"Passed by this place several times after recently moving to the area. Looked like it had a good amount of business most days so it must be good. I was sadly mistaken...

The decor in this place is a bit of an eyesore. There is a bar, some tables and booths, a pool area, what looks like stage for live music or karaoke. Very dimly lit and dirty/grungy feeling. 

Our waitress was very odd as well. Not very friendly and didn't seem to have any knowledge of the menu. When asking questions about it she didn't really have an answer. The food is not very good and is an odd mix of Vietnamese, and American Chinese. Every thing the pit group ordered was just bland and lacked any creativity.

Probably won't be coming back..."}
{"text":"Was excited to see this place open within walking distance of my apartment and decided to check it out. First thing you notice (or not notice) is the entrance. A side door, hardly marketed and hard to see. Once inside we were greeted by a server who informed us we could sit wherever we liked. We chose a booth in the corner of the raised area. There was a karaoke dj and a few large groups obviously there for the karaoke. The atmosphere was dark and stale. I ordered spring rolls and a regular steak pho. The rolls were nothing but filler and a few shreds of pork and a shrimp or two. They literally stuck to the plate. The pho came and my disappointment grew as I discovered 4 or less pieces of actual meat and far too few noodles to even out the amount of broth. Overall a disappointment. Would have rated one star but our server was prompt and friendly."}
{"text":"So many overpriced douchey places are popping up in our valley. Pho Cao is not one of them!   This is the real deal. Great food served late for a steal. This is the type of place that has launched AZ musicians. See the next Gonna Blossoms/ RCP before they hit it big. Not a strip mall joint, not some corporate crap; a small stage with great sound!  Delicious 8-15 buck plates and full bar too. Oh yeah, lots of parking too."}
{"text":"This is going to be dangerous having a Pho place this close to my house that's open until 2am.  

I went due to a Groupon and now will be a steady regular.  The Pho is one of the best I've had in the valley.  I sampled it before I doctored it up with sauces and it was full of flavor and would've been great as is, but I like it spicy so I add quite a bit of Siracha and chili flakes.  

I ordered the Pho Tai large which was a HUGE 50oz bowl with plenty of noodles and meat.  I also got the crispy vietnamese egg rolls which came as an order of 4 and were excellent.  

The service was very good never had to ask for a water refill or wait long for ordering or to get food.  

Overall this place is great I have not had the experience I see with others on here and hope I never do because this place will for sure be in my regular rotation."}
{"text":"The food is so yum O!!! Everything I have tried is amazing!!! I love pho and I gotta tell ya the magic is in the broth. When I'm feeling down or feel sickness coming on, pho is my go to comfort food. The broth can heal a broken heart :) The spring rolls are fresh and creative. I usually go with the shrimp and pork but recently tried the avocado and tofu, they were so good. My friend ordered the shaken beef stir fry. She was surprised and pleased with her dish. Marinated filet mignon, fresh sautéed vegetables, and jasmine rice. I stole a couple of bites and definitely decided that's what im ordering next time. The prices are great for the amount of food your served. The staff is awesome and are always willing to accommodate. I think it was meant to be, that they opened up right down the street from me. It's my favorite place to go for cocktails and food. They have a great happy hour and reverse happy hour, 1/2 off drinks and discounts on appetizers."}
{"text":"What a delightful surprise!  Honestly, if you're just driving by, at best, it looks like a small dive bar but treasures await inside for Foodies!
We ordered takeout and ordered a drink while waiting.  If you're searching for epic cocktails - forget it.  The wine is poured out of those little airport bottles (for freshness? ) but unlike the airlines it was only $4.
That said, the locals, the service (Lucas was the perfect host, bartender, and server), and the food was awesome.  While we pondered the menu an enormous plated ice cream extravaganza was delivered to the couple next to us and it could've easily been served at a fine dining restaurant.  
Once home, the Shaken Beef was divine with tender, abundant filet mignon/veggies in the most delicious sauce.  It honestly is the best pepper steak I've ever had.  My friend thoroughly enjoyed the Buddha Spring Rolls.  Even the chicken fried rice stood out with large chunks of perfectly cooked chicken and good flavor.
There is easy parking, karaoke, cheap drinks, and again - Incredible food!"}
{"text":"Who would have guessed, a Vietnamese food sports bar.  And the food is really good.  Authentic and fresh.  I'll be back for sure."}
{"text":"I was a little hesitant to come after my friend got food poisoning from here but saw this was the only place with vegetarian pho + broth. I was initially thrown off when walking in because it doesn't look like a typical Vietnamese restaurant. It's actually a bar that sells Vietnamese food. The server was really nice and the food was decent. And the spring rolls were on the smaller side but still tasty."}
{"text":"What a nice little surprise. A bit of a strange atmosphere, but fun. I knocked a star off because it smells like stale cigarettes and is a bit outdated.
We've had lunch here several times, great! 
First night we tried to come there was some sort of \"Death Metal\" band playing and there was a huge crowd, on night 2 was Christmas Karaoke.
Food is Excellent, super service every time we go there. Great Pandora channel playing during lunch.
We'll see you again tomorrow."}
{"text":"I really enjoy this place! I have been a few times and I am always greeted as soon as I walk in the door and receive great service from there.

I typically sit at the bar since I am usually with only one other guest for a bite and a drink and we always enjoy trying new drinks and hearing their specialties.  A few times, the manager (or maybe even owner?) has come out to to visit and ask how our experience is going.  I feel they truly care about their service and quality of food, which sadly is rare these days.

The chicken curry is ALWAYS amazing, as well as the #28, Com Bo Luc Luc (which was recommended to my friend by the manager/owner)

Never disappointed! Give it a chance and I am sure you will be back!"}
{"text":"If getting bent over and financially taken for some sub par plastic noodles and boiling hot water is what you need, this place is for you. To top it off you'll get to listen to blasting loud karaoke being sung horribly by some sad man walking around the whole place and horribly un attended by the clueless waitstaff. I hope you come with alot of money and prepared to burn hours away for some horrible soup."}
{"text":"Great environment, fun happy hours, and great food.  The management wants to make sure you're happy."}
{"text":"This place is the MUTHA-PHO-CAO!
We came here on a whim since I've been craving pho.
My boyfriend was very hesitant to eat here but decided \"happy wife..happy life\". Boy wasn't he happy after he finished devouring the Mongolian beef! I had the pho tai and potstickers.
This place definitely has great potential for a late night night cap that's close to home."}
{"text":"Why in the world would they automate the menu on their website to scroll every 10 seconds. It seems like they ought to fire their web coder. Couldn't decide what to eat because everytime I'm reading the menu items, it's changing the menu page on me. So just decided to go to Saigon Bowl, their menu doesn't skip out on me as I'm trying to make a selection."}
{"text":"Woah this is a Vietnamese Pho + Karaoke + Bar + Live Stage combo, a triple whammy!

The venue is definitely conducive to a good time. The selection of alcohol (lots of local beers on tap, large wine list, great cocktails) coupled with a bomb stage and lots of lounging spaces (leather sofas and the like) were great staples that took our regular night out to a new level. They even have a fancy disco ball lighting gizmo and a miniature DJ station. Did I mention this is a Pho place? 

The karaoke is intense. They have virtually every song imaginable nestled in a big black greasy book. They even have Tom Jones' Sexbomb, which is the sorta the soundtrack to my life and the only song that will get my ass on stage. Needless to say, we had a great time.

The food was four stars tops. The Pho is solid but won't blow you away. I had the Pho Ga--Chicken ($6.75 for a small). Don't be fooled by the word \"small,\" they have huge portions. Like, huge. The appetizers are good too: I was a fan of the fried calamari and the crispy spring rolls.

-----

Distinguishing Factor: So much more than a Pho restaurant. More like Pho-n venue."}
{"text":"Eh...If in Tempe, go to Khai Hoan for Vietnamese. The only thing this place has is it's late night hours (open until 2a on weekend)."}
{"text":"Ive tried this place twice now, and Ive yet to be terribly impressed. I absolutely love quality PHO and both trips to Pho Cao have made me wish I had went to my usual spot on the west side. I live in Old Town so this spot is convenient, but not much more than that. Service is ALWAYS slow, and forgetful. I have visited the old spot by the freeway, and now the new spot off of McDowell and both places were dark, dank and dive-y. I can appreciate a good dive bar, and even hole-in-the-wall type places, but this place seems to miss the mark on both. The Pho broth tastes like ramen broth. It isnt clear like good, slow simmered pho both is supposed to be. Pho Cao's broth is brown and the noodles are always clumped together in a ball at the bottom of the bowl. The spring rolls are decent but the peanut sauce is def from a jar. Its overtly sweet and tastes more like a peanut butter paste than sauce. Like I said, its not horrible, its just not a genuine pho restaurant. This is a karaoke joint that services hipsters who want to think they are eating genuine pho. Service is slow, and food is mediocre. I doubt I will return."}
{"text":"I really, really wanted to like this place. I've only had pho one other time, and was looking forward to trying it again.

I went on a Friday night when it wasn't terribly busy. My main complaint was the service. First of all, our server kept coming back to our table, seeming like he was getting increasingly irritated that we were taking our time to order. 
I ordered vegetarian egg rolls as an appetizer. I'm not sure what happened, if the server just wasn't listening to me-but he said \"Buddha rolls\" which I assumed was some official name for said egg rolls, so I said yes.  Apparently I had just ordered spring rolls without even realizing. Sure, that was a miss communication-however it could have easily been resolved without telling me that I didn't order egg rolls (which I had). I hate to play the customer is always right card, but in this case-I have to. I had to practically argue my way to getting my order corrected. I felt like my server was treating me as if I was just lying to be difficult. 

It's really sad because our food was really good. I enjoyed my veggie pho and eggrolls. My boyfriend, who came with, enjoyed his meal as well.

When the bill came, it looked as though our server had just charged us for the spring rolls anyway in addition to the veggie rolls. My temper had already flared enough at that point so I had my boyfriend handle it. Apparently he was \"going to fix our bill\"..well if you were going to fix it, why didn't you do that before setting the check on the table?!?!?! 

I don't predict a return visit, not at least in the near future."}
{"text":"Everything I wanted with this place happened. Finally a decent dive bar in Scottsdale. Great for a few friends to enjoy decent food and drink in a great atmosphere. Food $7-$12. Drinks $2.75-$8. I love that they have live music almost every night of the week."}
{"text":"I've been there a few times on weekdays and it was very good considering I don't often eat Vietnamese food. Spring Rolls were very good and the Pho, which I've never had before, was good as well. They also have pretty good happy hour deals. I'll be back."}
{"text":"Not really the standard pho place. It's a great place if you also want to hear live bands. Our last experience was great with a few new singers, amazing talent. Food is really good, the large bowl is quite large so my husband always orders the small and is full. Recommend trying the spring rolls and combination pho, it only comes in the large bowl so be hungry when you order."}
{"text":"Love this hole in the wall, late night open, yummy pho place. This place is great for a hangover. There are no windows in the place - full bar - and it's got fast and friendly service. In the evenings there's live music of all kinds which is always fun and interesting! (Except for Monday's) The Tamarind broth is super good if your looking to spice up your pho experience! It's spicy! 
This place is great to go just by yourself or with a big group."}
{"text":"Biggest rip off ever. Boyfriend went in to pick up for us. We got the salmon spring rolls. They totally sucked. And claimed to have all these ingredients and all it came with was lettuce and salmon. No avocado, nothing. My pho was fine. But online it was supposed to be 9.50 with all my add ins and it came out to 17.50. Complete ripoff. And my boyfriend got an entree with steak and shrimp. Tiny portion of steak and three tiny shrimp. 12 dollars. Sooooo ridiculous. Never going back. Otherwise the restaurant itself looks cool inside but would not recommend eating there if you want to get what you pay for BC you pay a lot and get nothing."}
{"text":"I'm so glad Pho Cao is reopened- and closer to my house! Food is as great as before, service is better than before. Couldn't be happier! Well, unless they got their website and online ordering back up and running. But still- 5 stars!"}
{"text":"So I've been hearing lots about the new pho cao that opened in my neighborhood and was very excited to try it out. But I was even more excited when I found out they have VEGAN pho!!!! Yes! Since I don't eat beef, it's hard to find pho places that serve this yummy hot soup beef-less since its traditionally a beef based soup. And let me tell you this vegan broth was awesome! I ordered the seafood pho but with vegan broth and it was delicious, filled with mushrooms and carrots too! Yumm yum! A bit over- priced compared to other pho spots but worth it if you are a non-beef pho lover!"}
{"text":"I was driving one day and noticed that Pho Cao is now in the neighborhood. Being constantly on the lookout for something new, I went in for lunch. Service was friendly, I was seated immediately, and I spent some time studying the menu.

I really wanted to like this place...

The restaurant itself is sort of dark and heavy with the dark walls and dark unfinished floor, and there is nothing to diminish the noise that reverberates off the walls and floor. I knew that if I returned here, it wouldn't be for the setting.

The server did check with me several times before I was ready to order, but I was glad he was paying attention. I decided on E17, Charbroiled pork and eggroll with vermicelli. The dish was very bland, and I found myself trying to flavor it up with Hoisin and Soy Sauce. That didn't work very well, so when I finally got someone's attention, I paid, and left most of my food behind. All though they weren't very busy, no one seemed concerned enough to ask me how my food was. 

I decided a few days later to give it another try, that perhaps I should have guessed E17 would be bland. I wanted to like this place. 

I entered, and was struck once again by the lack of atmosphere of any sort. it just feels like a big dive. This time I ordered two things to be fair, and I stuck with items I had read good things about in their ratings. I ordered the A5 Fried Chicken Pot stickers, and the P2 Steak Pho and sat back ready to have a better meal than on my previous visit. 

The Pot Stickers were a generous portion, but the filling didn't offer up much flavor, and the dipping sauce just came off flat, not really enhancing the fried dumpling, the outside of which was hard rather than crisp. The Pho also didn't yield much flavor, even with all of the fresh ingredients added.

The portions were generous, but without any richness of flavor, I just got tired of eating and requested my check. I'll note that just as on my first visit, no one ever checked back after delivering my food to me to see if it was to my liking.

A further challenge on my second visit was that a young family of about 8 came in with their small child. In addition to the loudness of their voices in the room with nothing to break the sound, the squalling child, who they made no attempt to placate or entertain, completed my experience of - no, I don't need to try this again.

Maybe I'm getting it all backwards, and being open for lunch is done on a whim, and they really want to be a loud, fun evening entertainment venue that happens to have food. The concept may have alluded me. I'm sorry I couldn't like it. 

The food wasn't horrible. Everything was very fresh. It just wasn't that tasty.  Also, at no point during either visit did I smell any food cooking."}
{"text":"Pho Cao just moved to our neighborhood so we decided to check it out and we're glad we did. We tried the fried tofu and the spicy mayo served with it was ok but we asked our server to bring peanut sauce and that was awesome. The dumplings had a delicious filling and great sauce as well. There was also hoison sauce, soy and sriracha on the table. I love sauces so I was in heaven! Jessica was our server and she was super nice, attentive and helpful with the menu. I got the chicken and veggies on egg noodles but....I added chinese sausage, which is my favorite!  It was really flavorful and there were a lot of veggies including bok choy, cabbage, onion, carrot etc...my main complaint was the music. Although it was jazz and not a bad band at all, it was just too loud."}
{"text":"I drove by Pho this week & couldn't wait to try it!

Came back tonight for Sunday dinner around 6pm.

There was live music and a seat yourself atmosphere.

The inside surprised me, because it's basically an old dive bar. 

We searched for a booth, but they were mostly dirty.

I noticed a girl slowly attempting to clear tables. Like 1 cup at a time.

Once we sat at a booth for 8, the only option for our family of 3, she stopped cleaning the other booths.

The menu was extensive with lots of Asian cuisine, random American food of fries & wings, and of course Pho.

The food & service was pretty quick. The food was warm and tasty. 

As we sat and ate, it was odd to me, as an ex-waitress, how short staffed the place seemed and how long tables stayed dirty.

I watched a waiter walk up to a dirty table next to us and clear off 1 fork. Only. Then shake his head at the rest.

Our waitress was nice, but literally ran around and shouted responses to customers, \"seat your self\" \"Walk up to the bar\" 
And looked pained when I asked for an extra plate for my son.

It was the kind of service that wasn't terrible, but didn't leave room for 5 stars, because they were running around crazy.

The music, at 6pm dinner, was also kind of terrible. Filled with swearing & bad Croning.

While the food was pretty decent, the dark atmosphere, random music and hardly cleanly spaces make me think I most likely won't be back."}
{"text":"I ordered takeout for the seafood dish. I wasn't that impressed with the crispy noodles, but the quality of the seafood was high. And the steamed veggies that are included with the dish were very flavorable. It's expensive but worth the additional expense if you're looking for high quality vietnamese food."}
{"text":"there was a reunion party thing going on for a group of people in their 50s-70s when we arrived for dinner. we also had no clue that it was some sort of ktv/restaurant hybrid but were still down to give it a shot. the open-room ktv was kind of distracting, so we choice to eat outside but a bunch of them were smoking/talking really loud so it was a lose-lose situation lol. 
we ordered the fresh coconut, a coke, and 2 phos. the coconut was the only thing that went right (but how can you mess that up when you just have to crack it open). the soda was flat, and the noodles that came in the broth were still FROZEN and they made no effort to boil it before putting it in or at least giving it more time before serving it. the broth was tasteless as well and we both left after taking a few bites."}
{"text":"Good food. Friendly staff. The owner is super cool. Full bar with awesome draft beer selection. Reasonably priced. The beef stew is amazing. They do karaoke several times each week if you are into that.  I love this place."}
{"text":"I really have nothing negative to say about Pho Cao.

Their food is consistently good, they're open SUPER late (YAY!) and they have a full bar.  

What really makes me give this place 4 stars, is the owner. He cares SO much about his patrons. I see him walking around the restaurant making sure that everyone is happy.  This place is his baby, and you can tell he's there to nurture it.

Their food is good, the atmosphere is relaxed and fun.

So - Have yourself a beer, a big steaming bowl of Pho, and listen to your friends sing some karaoke (yes, they have karaoke!)"}
{"text":"Let me start by saying that we have been here a few times before and their pho is very good. BUT tonight i really wanted pho and we don't get out of work til 9 so i was excited to see when we checked their hours that they were open til 1030. We got there at about 925 and walked in and we're told they were actually closed. I said \"aren't you guys open til 1030?\" and she responded \"oh ya, we are closing up early tonight....\"
We drove out of the way to go there and it was just really unprofessional.  If you have a set time that your establishment closes, how can you just decide to shut it down early if you have people coming in seeking service? At least lock the damn door then. Douche..."}
{"text":"Every time I have came in I am in the door as soon as they open. Which is 11 am, always pretty much the first or second guest in. I love the atmosphere and will need to come in during happy hour and the night life. 

Ok so the Vegan broth! Yesssss! YESSSS! YESSSS! It is beyond delicious I find myself just waiting til 11 so I can indulge my taste buds in the awesomeness. I'm pretty sure I might be addicted to it. 

The staff is so nice and always on top of everything.  I have now found my new obsession, my new lunch spot. I mean idk about you buy vegan broth just sells it for me."}
{"text":"Moving from the Pho and Starbucks capital of the country to Scottsdale has been tough.( for PHO ) Since Scottsdale thinks Pho Ga is just bland, watery chicken soup they can charge a fortune for, I've been driving to Chandler for the good stuff. THEN this place opened. Yelp reviews have kept me away until today. It's a dark bar atmosphere, Not dirty at all. My server was great. Live music at lunchtime on Sunday was also fun. Now, the pho. Someone complained that the broth was brown not clear.....yea,  well so? It was full of flavor. Clump of noodles in the center, again, yea so ??? they were perfect and lots of them. Happy girl !!!
wonderful, thank you for being here. I'll be back often. Run, don't walk to check this place out, unless you like bowls of water elsewhere, that is."}
{"text":"We were in the area and craving Pho. I found this on Yelp and saw decent reviews. I should have known better the moment we drove up that it wasn't good news.  When we walked in, it was straight up a bar atmosphere with a stage for live music.  It was dark, dingy and I don't know why we didn't just turn around and walk back out, but alas my son was hungry so we stayed and hoped for the best.  There was 1 server and about 3 tables that had patrons.  Our server tried his best, but it was so lackluster.  He never checked on us and we repeatedly had to ask for stuff.  Oh...and what's the point of memorizing what we order when you have to come back 2 times to ask us again what it was we ordered, and then a 3rd and 4th time for us to remind you that you've forgotten to bring us what we ordered.  The pho was terrible.  Three of us ordered it and my husband took a sip of the broth and pushed it aside and couldn't bare to eat any more of it.  My older son ate half because like I said, he was hungry, and my youngest just ate the noodles.  The spring rolls had no meat or shrimp but was completely overstuffed with shredded lettuce.  Ugh. I was so disappointed with this place.  We ended up leaving hungry because we couldn't finish our meals."}
{"text":"This is the place where I first had pho and it was amazing!! Pho Cao is a very friendly and upbeat place! The owner and staff are very helpful and the food is amazing too! I feel that Victor really does strive to make all his guests feel welcome by learning and remembering their names and making them feel so welcomed with every visit. For example when they started serving sushi there was one I did not care for and Victor took it off my bill and brought me something else. 

I am very big on customer service and this place definitely has it. This is my go to pho place and a place to just hang out with friends. Also it's where I recommend other friends to go for pho!

I love coming here and I come here as often as I can and usually pick this place over other Pho places."}
{"text":"Dinner here last night was very nice. We wanted something simple to warm our bellies and fill us up. Two small pho did the trick. One chicken. One vegetables. Lots of sharing. Happy patrons. Lots of sports tvs one with baseball. One football and two basketball. Looked like karaoke coming in later (we were early diners after 600 miles ) .not fancy. Not appealing from the outside. Friendly and nice on the inside. Lets go again. So many choices on the menu"}
{"text":"Absolutely love this place at its new location on McDowell Road. I highly suggest to order the A2 on the menu. This is an appetizer that will work for two. It's light and healthy. They have a clean nice atmosphere that comes alive at night with live music ranging from open Mic Night to Tuesday's featuring some highly acclaimed jazz artists. Definitely check this place out!"}
{"text":"If you serve a good Veggie Pho you are in my good book. That's the only thing I tried at Pho Cao is their Vegetable Pho with vegan broth and it was just amazing. Add to this a very friendly and attentive service.. a definite 5 star candidate!!"}
{"text":"I really like it here.  My partner and I are both vegans and we come here frequently for Pho and sometimes the curry and sometimes the vegan hot pot.  The vegan springrolls are great, and the budda rolls.  The place is cute with good service and fun drinks.  They typically have live music and it is usually nice.  Sometimes the music is too loud to have dinner conversation, so we usually only come if we just feel like chilling and not talking much."}
