{"text":"Pho was tasty (though this is my first time trying Pho so I have nothing to compare it to). The spring rolls were fantastic!!!"}
{"text":"I had the veggie wonton and my boyfriend had his usually pork/spring roll vermicelli bowl. I have to say that it was probably the best wonton soup that I ever had!!  Broth was not bland at all and the wontons themselves had amazing flavour!! The only reason that I didn't give a 5 was that the atmosphere wasn't too great in the restaurant itself and there was a bit of a musty smell.

Food was great though and I can definitely see us getting takeout in the future and making this our Airdrie Vietnamese go-to place :)"}
{"text":"This was surprising! We had never been here (or any of their locations) before so for some reason in our minds we were expecting a fast food type set up. We walked in and it is a full- on full service restaurant that is decorated in nothing like anything Vietnamese I have ever seen.

It was a Saturday afternoon and the place was dead so we had our pick of tables. The server was really quick and didn't say much through- out our stay. We ordered an appie and had to ask for some side plates when it came out, not a problem. But, the food was just mediocre. For this reason we (I) will continue our (my) search."}
{"text":"The service is always prompt, and the servers are normally very sweet younger teens/adult. One server was a boy, but a cross dresser. 
The menu is varied, more items that at some of the other Vietnamese places I frequent on McLeod. I personally think their portion sizes are larger, because I can never finish a thing I order. That being said, their prices are good for what they offer.
Since this place is large (it's the old Pizza Hut) there's never been a long wait.
Needless to say, it's been decided that this will be my go to restaurant if I crave Vietnamese.
Oh, and their fried banana spring rolls with ice cream is amazing - and comes in the perfect portion size for two people to have just a taste without going overboard."}
{"text":"This place is never too busy, so the wait is always short, and the service efficient.
It's your typical Vietnamese menu/decor. They do have a great Won Ton Soup
and fried spring roll. You'll always find a spot to sit at Rice for King since the 
restaurant is huge."}
{"text":"In my opinion the portions are very large and I couldn't finish mine. The food was fresh and hot. The service was good, and the food came fast. Could have used a little more spice. All in all a good value."}
{"text":"Sate beef pho was sub par. There's better places than this. $10 for a small bowl?
The waitress asked if I was finished, said no and she took my bowl anyways. No tip...

I've had better for less. Won't be going back."}
{"text":"We love Rice for King, it is our go-to place for Vietnamese food and it is consistently good. There is tons of selection, service is fast, and the food is always hot and perfect. The spring rolls and curry soup are to die for!!"}
{"text":"My fiance and I went for supper last night (we like to try out different Vietnamese places all the time), and prices for a Vietnamese place should be rather fairly inexpensive. But this place takes the cake of overpriced Vietnamese. 
The size of the food is small. We did not greeted at the door, just sat down and waited for 15 mins for water to come out, then another 15 mins for service. We had to track anyone who came our way. They pretty much ignored us and gave rude service when we complained in the end. 

Even though the food was fast, I cannot compare how the service was and how small the portions is for our food. A small bowl for $10 for just Pho? You kidding me? Golden Saigon is 10x better (I would recommend them instead). 
And to top things off for my complaint, I ordered a milkshake, and did not come out until we finished eating. We seen others get their meal before us even their shakes, and we get us last. Nice job Rice for King. Or can I say just plain disastrous!

I recommend to check out other Vietnamese places then coming here. Worst Vietnamese restaurant, I rather take my money elsewhere, where I know would treat me better than this place. Beside Vietnamese food is the same, just the service makes the difference."}
{"text":"Stopped by for lunch a couple times. The service was quick, the food tasty and fresh. They did mess up my friends order, but quickly remedied the situation. 

Staff is friendly and can get fairly busy during the lunch hour."}
{"text":"Service is quick, their commercial on television claims they don't cook with MSG     
I honestly wouldn't be able to tell either way. I ordered the all familar grilled satay chicken & grilled shrimp on vermicelli noodles, My wife had a bowl of Pho, and 9 year old had a vietnamese sub.
The prices at Rice for king, I find overall are a little higher then other vietnamese restaurants. I find the quality of the food isn't as good as lets say Saigon Y2k. I also find we get out of Saigon Y2k with a little more in our wallets as well. 
As a family eating out, that means something because you want value for what your eating. I do have to say though that not many vietnamese restos have the subs. My son liked eating that, since he really doesn't care to eat the other \"stuff\" on the menu that much.
The one thing I did notice on the sub that was missing, a key ingredient IMO was cilantro. If your a cilantro lover like I am you may be disappointed in their subs. Maybe it was just the type of sub he ordered I don't know.
Either way, I don't know if i'll be back to Rice for King. If eating without MSG is enough to entice me coming back I don't know. There are so many other options in Calgary to try as far as vietnamese goes now."}
{"text":"Good Viet restaurant have three qualities: fast service, big portions, and good price. Rice For King met the first two. My vermicelli dish came out to almost $15. I'm use to paying $10-12. The pork, chicken, and spring rolls were very dry. Their fish sauce was watered down with not much flavor, and that's saying something since fish sauce is the opposite. 

You can tell the restaurant's entirely run by the family who owns it. The \"staff\" were dressed in sweats/t-shirt. The inside feels like a restaurant, but the service feels like you're eating at home.

I've had better."}
{"text":"Always on the hunt for the perfect bowl of Satay Beef Pho! We used to eat at Rice for King before they closed and werent overly impressed. However! The new store (in the strip mall directly beside their old location) was one of the best dining experiences ive had! Immaculately clean and BY FAR the absolute best service ive ever had in a Vietnamese restaurant!!! VERY attentive staff, fair price and a darn good bowl of soup! Perfectly seasoned, excellent quality, fresh beef and PERFECT service! Quick service, excellent food and very qualified staff! May be my new go to for \"close to home\" Pho!!!!"}
{"text":"Went for lunch on day during work. Went early at 1:45 and not to many people in the restaurant but started fulling up through the lunch hour. Service is fast and attentive - maybe too fast as I hadn't been there before and couldn't make a decision :)

Man did the food come out fast and hot! The kitchen is really on the ball.

Had deep fried wantons to share - good size with 8 pieces. Like that they bought 3 separate sauce on the side dishes so we each had our own.

Both my colleges got pork + spring roll rice vermicelli. Came on a plate instead of a bowl. Good size portion and both ladies didn't finish the whole thing. Both said they enjoyed their choice.

I had green curry chicken with coconut rice. Tasty and huge portion. Don't think I finished more than half and had the rest for lunch the next day. I'm a sucker for this dish and would definitely return for it.

Paid at the front once we were done.

Will I be back? Absolutely! Good value for money and incredibly fast service in the lunch hour. Looking forward to trying more dishes with them."}
{"text":"This place is a regular stop for me. I first became one of their patrons at their other restaurant, Lemon Tree, in Lynwood. When I told Sonny, the owner that I don't eat meat, he assured me that he would make sure that everything that was prepared for me was meat and fish sauce free. Afterward, I told my family about it and it became one of our Sunday rituals to eat there after church. We had to stop going, because they stopped being open on Sundays (boo!), but then Sonny called us to let us know that he had opened up another restaurant that was :)

Their veggie spring rolls are my favorite thing to order there, and we all wind up sharing the plate of fluffy, crispy salt & pepper tofu. I've gone there so often I've practically memorized the menu. For the adventurous, they offer a durian shake, which none of us has balls big enough to order. Sonny also happens to be the chef at Rice for King, so he always takes care of us and he's not at all precious about his menu. If you want to leave something out or add a couple of fried eggs, he's more than willing to accommodate you. My family likes to order the beef ball soup with extra balls. The only neg I'd have is that the soup sometimes is a little on the salty side, but that can be easily remedied with the lime slices they give you.

Delicious food, friendly service and an owner that makes you feel at home. And! They deliver in 45 minutes when you're too drunk to cook for yourself."}
{"text":"We were headed out for a Monday night dinner, and since it was getting a little late, this was one of the few places that was open for Vietnamese.  It was overall a satisfactory experience.

Atmosphere: 3/5  The restaurant was spacious, clean, and quite large for the number of patrons.  I like the open area and it was an interesting space with some pillars.  It was quiet and we were one of two tables there.  

Food: 3/5  I had the grilled beef and salad rolls on vermicelli.  I was happy to be able to substitute the spring rolls with salad rolls!  Overall, I enjoyed my dish which ended up being quite large.  There was quite a bit of beef!  The taste was ok, although I would've liked more carrots and fresh vegetables relative to meat.  The fish sauce was ok - I thought it was pretty typical but maybe a bit dilute.

Service: 4/5  We were attended to very quickly; our waitress was efficient and friendly

Price: 3.5/5  Reasonable for the size and amount of food

Overall: 3.5/5  Overall satisfactory experience with generous portion sizes in a quiet clean environment; taste was okay.  I would have to try some of the other Vietnamese restaurants in Airdrie as comparison."}
{"text":"The wife and I are big fans of Vietnamese cuisine and have hit all the local places.  This one we were avoiding for some time due to the fact that the prices are significantly higher here than the other restaurants.  We finally decided to give it a try....

We walked into what looked like a very Greek restaurant, standard pillars and archways you would see common in most traditional Greek establishments.  Confusing, but whatever.  There were 2 other couples in the place, far from busy.  The menu was very lacking when compared to all other similar restaurants.  
 
I ordered a lemongrass chicken and noodle stir-fry with mixed vegetables.  The wife ordered a beef stew.  

The beef stew:
Served in the standard huge bowl with one exception.  The giant bowl had a foot on the table about 1.5 inches across.  Tiny little base, huge bowl?  Put your spoon in and you nearly tip the bowl.  I figured a certain someone will be wearing their soup/stew soon.  As for the taste, I'm not sure how you can call it a beef stew when its made from tasteless chicken broth with a couple small chunks of beef in it, a handful of noodles and almost nothing else.  Disappointing. 

The chicken/noodle/veggie stir-fry:
I don't know how this is called a stir-fry at all.  This dish was 75% raw peppers and onions, 10% noodles that had just come out of the fires of hell waiting to melt your face off, 2% frozen chicken that was still frozen despite sitting on the noodles, and 13% grease (no, not sauce, grease!).  No sauce, no lemgrass, no spices, no flavour.  The only thing was that cooked was the noodles.  I probably would have been more impressed if they just gave me a plate with whole peppers and onions for me to chop up myself, and a glass of grease for a drink. 
Unbelievable. 

We both are not people that complain, but we were extremely close.  Instead we just smothered everything in the one thing they couldn't screw up, bottled hoisin sauce, and managed to choke half our meals down before giving up.  

We waited for the bill for a while. and continued to wait. and waited some more.   Just as I stood up to go to the counter to inquire about the bill we finally received our drinks.  

And they charge a premium price?!   What makes this premium in any way?

Needless to say we won't be back."}
{"text":"I always stop by here for lunch since it's pretty close to where I work.

They're very prompt with service and the servers are very friendly (some playfully shy.).

The food is pretty satisfying for vietnamese food, I've had a few sick days where their Pho Bo Sate has come in handy. Their bubble teas are great, order the avocado and jackfruit for the non-powdered mix. Although I'm a little disappointed in their iced coffee, because it's served in the glass, rather than the cool steeping contraption it usually comes from.

Prices? pretty good, at least they meet the standard in usual vietnamese meal prices (10-20 can get you a great meal set)

5/30"}
{"text":"My wife and I usually order from here because it's quite close to home. We have not yet eaten in, but whenever we order take out the food is ready fairly quickly. The vermicelli dishes are quite good, better than the other Vietnamese restaurant nearby. Salad rolls are a staple of ours too, and we are never disappointed."}
{"text":"In fairness, I gave this place five stars, but I only ever order 21.

So, 21 is as good as it gets. Curry seafood soup with vermicelli noodles? Why even look at any other item on the menu? I love this so much I go at least once a month, some months once a week. And I have had the seafood soups other establishments offer -- no where near as tasty. I have introduced this dish to many of my co-workers and now they too are addicted. Which is great because there is no MSG at this restaurant.

Service is prompt, staff is super friendly, location is great with ample parking.

My friend argues that the \"beef and tomato\" soup is better. You be the judge because I refuse to stray from my favorite."}
{"text":"Ordered in our go-to Vietnamese in the SE and were not surprised that our delicious food arrived right when they said it would. It is tasty and they actually deliver (which is not common for places in my experience). 
We will keep ordering as long as they are our favorite....."}
{"text":"food quality average
Pretty pricey for Vietnamese
Services are below average 
I would come here only if I'm really hungry when I am at Starbucks"}
{"text":"Update from my initial 2012 review:

If possible, the service was even worse this time than last. We had seen some commercials for Rice for King recently that led us to belive that perhaps they had stepped up their game. We were sorely dissappointed.  Servers were slow to come around and disinterested in taking our orders.  Food quality was middle of the road as far as Vietnamese restaurants go and prices were acceptable.  Servers flat out refused our request for side plates to share food and were rude when we even asked. We won't give this place a 3rd chance."}
{"text":"Driving around the area, we decided to try this place out, as it's a free standing establishment that can be seen from Mcleod Trail. Decent looking restaurant, so popped in for a quick bite.

Service was good, tables were clothed unlike most Vietnamese places, seemed a bit up scale for a bowl of pho but I can really get used to this. 

Menu had a lot of options, prices seemed a bit steep for what you can get but there were no other Vietnamese places around. We were quite disappointed when the food actually came though. I'm used to getting the massive deep bowl of vermicelli and spring rolls, bbq pork and the works. This place is elegantly different, your food is half the portion but very nicely presented on a plate. Few bites in I was pleasantly surprised at how yummy my dish was, and digging into my dining duo's plate, decided this place hits all the right notes. 

We left sort of hungry but next time we will be ordering 2 of everything to make up for the portion size."}
{"text":"Was out and about with my mom running errands and so didn't even think about lunch till 2pm!  Came here on a hungry whim as I've seen a few commercials for it.  Mom ordered pho, and I ordered Bun. Her pho was better than my bun. My pork was extremely tough.  They were nice though and did substitute my spring rolls for veggie spring rolls (cuz their's has pork + shrimp).  Veggie spring rolls were not very good though. 

Since this is my first time here, I would come back to try other items and give them another chance (I did see a salad roll w satay chicken that I'd like to try or  maybe even try their stew noodle soup)."}
{"text":"It's good stable viatnamese dishes... It's not the best I've ever had but it's definitely a good place to eat.

One thing I do like about this place is the seating and location, great for groups and reasonable prices.

Will definitely eat here again from time to time. Oh and a friendly reminder not to wear a white shirt if you're getting the soup!"}
