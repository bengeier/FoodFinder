{"text":"Spectacular fresh and quickly prepared Mexican food. I had two tacos, Carne Asada and Adobada. The seasoning and flavor was excellent. Drop on by and give them a try!"}
{"text":"Being new to Vegas I am finding my way around taco shops. This place is my new favorite!  Great value too!"}
{"text":"This place shits on the other local Mexican spots because of their quality of food and organization. Their service and locale is less than desired, but the food is dabeezknees."}
{"text":"I fully recommend this restaurant. The food was good, the drink was awesome, and the guys were fun there are good people working and cooking and it's a nice place. And is not too expensive either."}
{"text":"We came here for breakfast burritos 3 out of the 6 mornings we stayed in Vegas. The chorizo is super flavorful. The fresh salsas are delicious and spicy."}
{"text":"Bomb ass food ..... great price and  I eat here at least 1 a week now always get my food right. Clean place and the salsa is spicy and delicious.."}
{"text":"Food here is delicious, better than a robertos or don tortaco. Employees are super nice as well."}
{"text":"My son loves Mexican food and we wanted something good and fast to eat on our drive home from Las Vegas.  Based on the reviews we stopped here.  My son didn't want to eat here once he saw the place and commented that most reviews are fake.  I have to believe that is the case here.  I would say that the food was inedible.  It was super greasy and portions of meat were very small.  Stay away.  Also we realized that one of the items we ordered did not make it into our bag but we weren't willing to turn around to drive back and get it once we saw had bad the food was."}
{"text":"Flavorful meat and good portions. Service was a bit slow. The asada nachos were full of meat!!"}
{"text":"This is a good place buy food to go. The prices are very reasonable. I like combo plates, green Chile, machaca, tamales, and chorizo. The burritos are also good."}
{"text":"I had the torta adobada and three tacos: carne asada, chorizo, and carnitas.  It seemed to me, and I could be wrong about this, that the torta adobada had mayo on it.  It just seemed odd, not a flavor that I would expect in Mexican food.  It was good, fresh roll, nice size, but I thought the tacos were better.  I would have liked a little more flavor.  I added hot sauce and a squeeze of fresh lime.  The meat was cooked perfectly.  All in all, good, but not great."}
{"text":"I love the carne asada tacos. It's in the gas station but it is a pretty decent place."}
{"text":"We really enjoyed the authentic experience. The food was so good it's now our go to for Mexican food."}
{"text":"It's located in a sketchy area of Vegas and it's also by a gas station, but don't let that fool you they have the best Mexican food in the southwest area! I suggest the carne asada tacos, nacho/or carne asada fries. All the food items are priced really well too!"}
{"text":"Literally came to this place 2 days in a row for a quick lunch. Recently moved and needed something quick and around the corner. Read the yelp reviews so I had to check it out. OMG yes. This place is DELICIOUS and they don't make their foods too salty nor oily.  The staff are supper friendly as well. So far I've had the enchiladas, steak tacos, and tamales. They do put a lot of sauce on there so you can ask for it on the side. Also, don't forget the red hot sauce !! Fireee"}
{"text":"Oh my! people nice enough, but I did not come here to eat them; instead I would not eat anything here because the place is so dirty..Go to Taco Taco instead similar prices and much better food."}
{"text":"This is the real deal.  Only a couple of tables.  To go is your. Best option.  The sauces for the bar are excellent. Best Mexican around.  Could eat here every day."}
{"text":"The Al Pastor nachos are bomb and Tuesday's are dollar chicken tacos which are also amazing."}
{"text":"if you want some comfort Mexican food, come here! The area is a little sketch, yes but worth a try! Yummy food! Enchiladas are where it's at!"}
{"text":"Ordered 5 tacos, chips, and 2 Churros food was made quickly and was fire. The food was so good went back the next day and did it again great taco spot. (They serve other items but the tacos & churros locked me in)"}
{"text":"Okay, so we're in Vegas for a week, staying at the Grandview (across from the Southpoint, which has movies for $5.25 all day Tuesdays, by the way), and found Rodolfo's on Yelp. It's an easy mile up LV Blvd. from the Grandview, located in a corner of a gas station convenience store. Don't be dissuaded. The food is really good. One review stated that the carne asada tacos were the best in Vegas; both sons got them, and my husband got the California burrito (also with carne). I asked my 10-year old (feed him or fear him) if the carne was the best, and he said, \"Definitely.\" Me: \"Really?!\" Him: \"Yes.\" Me: (skeptically) \"Really?\" Him: \"Yep.\" So there you go. Hubby liked the burrito too. I had a veggie burrito and found it tasty. I'd come here again!"}
{"text":"Authentic tasty Mexican food attached to a gas station. There are a few booths inside to dine in and a picnic table outside.  You can't beat the prices. I ordered 3 carne asada street tacos for $5.  Boyfriend ordered steak quesadillas which I ended up snatching half of.  We split a large horchata which was probably the best I ever had.  Total price around $12 plus a few bucks to the sweet lady behind the counter who didn't speak much English but was super friendly.  Sometimes the best food can be found in the most unexpected places."}
{"text":"Located in a gas station, this place is definitely a charmer. People always say you need to visit Tacos El Gordo for the best tacos in Vegas, but they are WRONG. Rodolfo's is the way to go!   The staff is super nice and very polite. Because its in a gas station, the lobby area is ridiculously small, there is only 3 booths available, so don't plan on dining in. Their street tacos are the best hangover cure, TRUST; and they are affordable, unlike Tacos El Gordo. ¯\_(?)_/¯   Vegas visitors: add this place to your to-do list. Vegas residents: you should know about this place."}
{"text":"Would never have stopped without Yelp. Great food, from a very tiny restaurant adjacent to a Mini-mart. Both my husband and I had super dishes."}
{"text":"What an awesome little surprise this was! Had the carne asade tacos which were cooked and seasoned perfectly. Def happy and coming back"}
{"text":"I was skeptical at first because it's inside a gas station, and where I come from, that usually means the food is mediocre but they proved me wrong.   The guys there are always friendly. They have made me chorizo breakfast burritos with only egg whites and the burrito is so good! Not heavy, but a lot of food for the price!  I've gotten their carne asada nachos and they're so good! The asada is seasoned and not fatty, good helping of cheese and sour cream and guacamole.   I ordered the same two items a second time to see if my first time was a good fluke experience but the food was consistently good again!   Try them out!"}
{"text":"I checked this place out on yelp because the business had a rating of 4 1/2 stars on a Tuesday for $1 chicken tacos. There honestly isn't a difference between this place and the other competitors Don Tortaco and Robertos. My boyfriend didn't like the food at all. I thought it was just okay. I won't be returning."}
{"text":"Really all rice??!! went to the gas station to buy some water they fixed my meal while I was away and handed me my bag to go and I see all this when I get home . Isn't this a new business? They should treat their customers right and at least ask me if I wanted extra rice. I'm a first time customer i won't come here again."}
{"text":"Despite the location this place always have good food and good customer service.. My food is always hot and fresh! Street tacos is AMAZING"}
{"text":"Authentic Mexican food! On our way to the airport and we wanted some good and quick Mexican food ! The only reason I give it four stars is there is only 3 tables one of which is out of the sun. I was pleased with the taste of the food and it was quick fresh service!"}
{"text":"I'm from Dallas where the best taco spots are connected to gas stations... so it doesn't bother me lol.   The food is authentic, reasonably priced, and really good! The service is fast and all of the employees are friendly. The only thing is the Horchata isn't as cinnamony? as I usually like it...   *Try the adobada burrito!"}
{"text":"Food was great do good the carna asada was well seasoned the well good prices the cook was friendly but cashier was not good at all she was taking my order and she was laying on the cash register she was a good person well to talk with but that was m little reason."}
{"text":"First time visit: The good:  Friendly staff. Good al carte & combination plate options. Reasonable prices. Large portion. Easy ordering. Fast preparation.  The bad:  Large salty burrito. I think the culprit was the chicken. When restaurants over salt their food - it's concerning since it's sometimes done to coverup not so fresh meat products or to act as a preservative. The cook may have just had a heavy hand.  Regardless, the ridiculous amount of salt ruined what would have otherwise been a darn good burrito.  The store could benefit from being redesigned & updated (interior & exterior). Even just updating signage & menu elements/methods would help improve things.   Tiny styrofoam water cups. C'mon, just give a regular size cup for water. Having to get up multiple times during a meal to keep refilling tiny cups is annoying and unnecessary.  Also, try using more planet friendly materials...there are better alternatives in similar price range as styrofoam.  The ugly: It's in a sketchy area (or rather, the folks who hang out around the store are sketchy!). This aspect isn't part of my rating of the restaurant though."}
{"text":"This place brings back memories from California there Carne Asada and Al Pastor tacos are amazing!! I love street style tacos. I'm glad we found this place!"}
{"text":"It was my first time and it was amazing! The food was hot and fresh which made it extra yummy! The meat was so savory and the green salsa was fresh!"}
{"text":"The food here is getting worse and worse the   Corn tortillas that they use for tacos are hard and rancid .their pico the Gallo should be called pico de onions bc that's all you could find in it.tamarindo Fresca tasted like vinegar of course it was bad. Carnitas are old and very dry!! Let's not even talk about the service because the cashier is more concerned about pleasing the cook than taking the order correctly!!"}
{"text":"Best Mexican Restaurant in Vegas.. The Enchiladas were delicious.. We also had camarones a la diabla, tacos de pastos, asada fries.. Everything was perfect and we are super picky when it comes to mexican food!!"}
{"text":"Great inexpensive Mexican food. Dollar chicken tacos on tues. Better for take out as the dining room is small. They also serve posole everyday, which was surprising. Can't wait to try the enchiladas and their Spanish rice. The area has some shady looking people so watch your back."}
{"text":"3 tacos for 5 bucks is a good deal and you get plenty of meat and they are delicious!"}
{"text":"The food is always cooked to order , staff is friendly , this is THE PLACE to grab a quick bite of authentic Mexican Food , I'm here all the time !"}
{"text":"My family loves this little hole in the wall. Great authentic Mexican food and the staff is friendly! We go once a week at least. They even know me now when I call for take out"}
{"text":"Looks can be deceiving...these tacos are not only delicious but cheap too! We had carne asada, carnitas, and adobada..the \" small\" tacos  are actually regular size tacos..."}
{"text":"Amazing carne asada!! Everything on the menu is great!!! We eat here multiple times a week!  Great food and prices!  Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"This is definitely a hidden gem! The lady who owns the restaurant works and really strives to give you amazing quality food. The prices are very reasonable and the portions are big. The carne asada fries are probably the best in town. The only downside is there isn't a lot of room to dine in."}
{"text":"After eye-ballin this spot for months, we decided to try it out. Just as other reviewers have said, it is extremely small and the are a is a little sketchy. However, the food was absolutely amazing. We got the 3 for $5 tacos and the Carne asada fries. It was all delicious!! The meat was tender and well seasoned. The fries were cooked perfectly. Not too salty and quite flavorful. I've had these fried from other establishments but these were by far the best!!"}
{"text":"Really good! I transplanted into Vegas from Orange County, have had Mexican food from some of the greatest taco joints and carnicerias out there. Santa Ana! I have not had good experiences anywhere in town yet, since we moved. This place finally hits the spot!!! Perfect balance of ingredients. Great spices. Our second experience is even better. The area is a little sketchy, next to a budget motel, I recommend calling in your order and you're in and out in 3 minutes. Worth giving a try. Please! I don't want them to close lol"}
{"text":"I like this place.  I can only ding it for location and the fact that adding cilantro to a burrito costs a whole dollar.  Other than that, they cook the carne asada right there.  I usually get the Conga Burrito which is basically beans rice and meat.  The food is good, if not great but don't ask for cilantro.  Seriously...one dollar more.  I'm not cheap, but come on.  Other than that, it's recommended.  Don't let it being in a gas station fool you, this place is cool."}
{"text":"I must admit I was a tad skeptical because of the location but the photos looked pretty tasty and the reviews weren't too bad. Hey! I drive past this place every day on my way home, so why not try it out.  For my first visit, I decided to try a few different things. Always have to try the tacos- They offer 3 tacos for $5, so I tried 1 chicken, 1 carne asada and 1 al pastor, added a cheese quesadilla and a side of rice. 2 churros for desert. The tacos were very flavorful and filling. Quesadilla needed more cheese and you can't ever go wrong with some rice. I chose the spicy red sauce for dipping and it was so good. Made me sweat a little.  The menus is reasonably priced and they offer a variety of items. They also have breakfast options. It is in the lobby of the gas station, so there are few spots for dine in, plan for takeout."}
{"text":"Great food, but order lunch at breakfast....very slow.  Worth the wait- if you can...if not, you will not be pleased."}
{"text":"Better then any don tor taco or Roberto's. Fries were very well done, perfectly cooked with ample amounts of carne asada. I devoured a brilliant torta (basically a sandwich with ur favorite meat if you didn't know now you know).   Overall super cool guys running that spot and they make some quality made to order food !"}
{"text":"Breakfast: delicious. Jamaica is sooo good. This is a truly hidden gem. Its a tiny place but it's really good. Try the carne asada tacos meat is delicious! Salsa has a great flavor and spicy like mmm yummy', of course they have non spicy salsas....Fast service. Food was ready like in 7mnts 10mnts the most. for 2 adults 3 childrens Friendly cuatomer friendly and clean. Try it!"}
{"text":"Went here for the first time and ordered the 3 tacos for $5 and posole. Seriously some of the best Mexican food I have had in a while. Carne asada had great flavor and the posole was sooo good! Yum!"}
{"text":"When the craving for Mexican foods comes on usually I have to seek out an establishment on the strip. This is not easy for locals just looking for something fast. I found that sweet spot that meets my needs half way. It's not epic cuisine, but it beats many other fast food type places. It rides that thin line. Their food is even great with home made margaritas. They do not sell alcohol here, but their lobby is not big at all. This is best for take out and enjoy at home with the family and a great movie or show on Netflix.  The staff here is so amazing and while Spanish is their first language, they can understand English perfectly. I was able to place my order and even answered some of the questions he asked in Spanish with my broken Spanish. Again, the lobby is super small with only three tables. This restaurant is constantly busy too. There were three people in line when I came in. The line moves slow but it is because most orders are like mine, huge and with only two employees they fulfill the orders promptly and efficiently too. My order was 100 percent perfect.   whole family wanted Mexican food so our order consisted of this: the number 2 which is two beef tacos with beans and rice. An order of Carne Asada fries which has steak on top of french fries and sour cream all over the place. Off the a la carte I ordered 3 regular beef tacos, a bean tostado, and the three rolled tacos. All the food was amazing and tasty. What could be a better night than Mexican food, margaritas, and Netflix all at home!   Wanted to yet update again:  When is it a good time for Mexican food? How about everyday! After trying this restaurant again, wanted to re-Yelp about it.  Decided to try other items from the menu, and retry a few already sampled. This time the cashier (did not catch her name), that took my order was so amazing and helpful. After I placed my order which went fine, she came out and was cleaning tables in the lobby. I was doing my Yelp thing.   You know that thing don't eat it till I take a picture of it. I was taking picture of the food. And out of the corner of my eye; you get the look. What are you doing? Did we make that order right for the customer?  I happily told her that I was writing a Yelp review and taking pictures of the food for the review. She nodded and went on cleaning the tables. Sometimes we have to explain our passion and weirdness to the outside.   The service here is stellar and from prior reviews on Yelp I see why so many people re-visit again and again! Ok three separate occasions with three different cashiers to achieve no imperfections is something to Yelp about. Thanks for providing the customers with such greatness, it keeps us all coming back for more.  This round everyone was hungry so we went with a take out order. We ordered two orders of the steak fries but with no guacamole. The steak this time was well done and they don't skimp on the steak, cheese, or sour cream. For $8.99 what a deal! My oldest had the No 2 again but on his two tacos only meat and cheese, no rabbit food. The twins and I shared the a order of the cheese enchiladas and one of the beef enchilada. These are yummy too! The only disappointment was the cheese enchiladas could have the cheese melted a little more! But it's not worth cutting any stars over.  We cannot forget the puppy I ordered her a beef taco but without the salsa. And I had half of it. This was great plus the puppy did get some cheese enchilada too. However, my half of the beef taco I drowned in green sauce.   The green sauce that they serve here is very good and it gives that burn effect later.  This visit will tide we over until I need another fix of Mexican food! I will return again and again as I've done in the past!"}
{"text":"Was great service but steak was a little stuff suds. Seem like burrito was smaller than before .Hmm kinda rushed job on it."}
{"text":"Always love trying new Mexican food joints. This one hit the spot with me. I'm a fan of a good dish consisting of 3 tacos and chips. Simple, and they do it great!   Their breakfast burritos will knock off the socks of any \"robertos\" - they're junk!   Great churros - I wish they had a dipping sauce though!   The prices are great. . You won't find better street style tacos in this area.   The hot sauces the have are incredible. . Red , Green (I think) and my absolute favorite their Habanero sauce!!!   Give Rodolfos a chance, you'll enjoy it."}
{"text":"I love this place, quick and great food.. The people that work there are really nice people, they have 3 tacos for only $5... The carne asada tacos and fish tacos are the freaking bomb... I never use to like Mexican food because I'm a picky eater but this place changed my mind.... Love them"}
{"text":"Great tacos! But be aware--it's located in a gas station store and has only 3 tables (seats 4 people each table). But the tacos are good and the cashier was friendly."}
{"text":"Best tacos and carne asada fries I've ever had!!! My boyfriend ordered the carne asada fries and I ordered 2 carne asada tacos and a chicken taco and everything was delicious! We will definitely come back on our next Vegas getaway!"}
{"text":"Great for a late night taco run. They make the food quick & delicious. $5 for 3 tacos, pretty good deal. Had 3 Carne Asada & 3 Carnitas tacos. I'm hooked! I'm now convinced the best Mexican restaurants are attached to gas stations.  The place is small but totally worth checking out."}
{"text":"Omg! Sooo goood the carnitas tacos are to die for! Carne asada fried are bomb too! This place is a must try if your in the area"}
{"text":"Don't let the gas station location fool you. These are the best tacos in this neighborhood. I recommend the food for take out as it isn't a dine in kind of place.  Their menu is pretty comprehensive with tacos, burritos, enchiladas, entrees. Much more than I expected.  If only the rest of Vegas had Mexican food this good."}
{"text":"Love this place, I was staying at emerald suites south right behind this place and it's really really good. The sopes are the best, the staff is friendly and the next time I'm in town ill make sure and stop by."}
{"text":"I definitely would choose their chorizo burritos over the breakfast ones. The workers are so kind. I can't wait to try some other items off of the menu.  This place is attached to the gas station, in case you have trouble finding it."}
{"text":"The place has generous portions and I miss California style taco shops, the carne asada was exactly as it should be, a little pricy but for $8 I got a hitch ate and carne asada with cheese and guacamole. It was good"}
{"text":"Terrible service, would not reccomend someone to eat here unless you want attitude from the lady working here she thinks its okay to yell at customers.. Terrible"}
{"text":"I've lived in the Las Vegas area since 2002.  I've been looking for the best carne Asada tacos in Vegas for 16 years and today I found them. RODOLFO'S is awesome!!!   Haven't had tacos this good since last time I was in Baja 12 years ago and I'll be spending a lot of money here every week.  Great service. Amazing tacos and good prices.  If you're a taco nut like me than trust me!!  You will not be disappointed here.  Good job Rodolfos, I'll be a regular!!"}
{"text":"Their cheese and guacamole fries are so good! The fries are so soft. They even let me add grilled onions for a dollar which I didn't mind at all. Worth it. But I got lost from the address from yelp."}
{"text":"I love this place. It's super tiny and right to the point like get your food and go. The workers are always super nice to me and the food is always sooo good ! I usually get the carne asada torta which comes out to $5.90 and I have no complaints."}
{"text":"Quick, cheap, and delicious! The pickled carrots are incredible. My boyfriend got a chicken burrito that was FILLED with chicken, there were no beans or rice which was a pleasant surprise as most places make their burritos filled with rice and beans with a little bit of chicken."}
{"text":"I live nearby and whenever I'm craving decent and quick Mexican food, this is my go-to. The same people are always working and always pleasant. Service is quick and the food is great. The gas station is sketchy as hell, but the risk is worth it."}
{"text":"Oh my, I got into Vegas and while waiting for a friend to arrive I checked yelp to look for some tacos.  I only tried 3 carne asada tacos, but they sure hit the spot. Much better than my options in Northern MN :)"}
{"text":"Hard to find real Mexican food in Las Vegas let alone late at night open tell midnight they cook everything fresh and it's one of the cheapest places around"}
{"text":"THEY GOT POSOLE!   When you're no longer dating a Mexican, it's tiring trying to find a mother who will cook you some bomb posole! So you settle with finding posole at a Mexican restaurant, and even that's hard find!   When I see posole, (not menudo) I'm Suppose to get it by law. This place did my posole cravings enough. It was pork which I usually prefer chicken! But I'm a beggar at this point so I can't also be a chooser. That would just make me unlikable!   Tacos were decent! Posole was decent. Also super ghetto area! Like homeless people outside waiting for your money type \"ghetto\" it is attached to a gas station so that might have something to do with the traffic! If you're a chick, don't go alone in dark hours! You know, the usual precaution!"}
{"text":"This is the only true Southern California style Taco Shop I have found in Las Vegas. I'll be coming here a lot"}
{"text":"Tacos were BOMB And the salsa   The cook was really nice even gave us some Mexican remedie pa la cruda"}
{"text":"The tacos were amazing! I came in 3 times during my stay in Vegas. I don't like onions therefore I asked for plain tacos. The green mild sauce tasted tangy with lime flavor. This was icing on my tacos. Everything was freshly made!"}
{"text":"Amazing!! First time in and my #8 was cooked to order and incredible. The hot sauce is HOT so don't mess with it unless you're a pro Mexican foodie (;"}
{"text":"This place is excellent. The employees who were working this evening were fantastic. The food was great taco shop food and reasonably priced. It's in the back of the gas station grocery store so don't miss it. There are only three tables and it's really small. If I stay on this side of town again in the future I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Damn good tacos! I'm always on the lookout for some good tacos and this place definitely did not disappoint. Reminded me of being back home in Cali. Will absolutely be back for more and more every time I'm in Vegas. And don't forget the Horchata to compliment the tacos..."}
{"text":"Excellent food!  One of the best California Burritos I've had in a long time.  Great food at affordable prices!"}
{"text":"Filling and fast!  Served with a smile. Right down the street from me. Give it a try you won't be disappointed these guys work hard and it shows."}
{"text":"Yum! Love at first bite! I ordered the Al Pastor Nachos and carne asada tacos. Even though the salsa bar was close at the time I was there * =( boo *, I'll be looking forward to it on my next visit.  Food: The Al Pastor and carne asada were rich in seasoning and cooked perfectly. Other Mexican fast food restaurants tend to overcook their meat or put little to no seasonings. I was surprise how juicy and flavorful they came out to be! I haven't had Al Pastor in a long time and to have it done the right way is flippin' awesome.   Location: Located inside the 76 gas station. If you're going northbound on Las Vegas boulevard, it'll be on your left.   Quick service with friendly employees. I suggest you take your food to-go since there's only 3 tables. Other than that, this place is a diamond in the rough for the Southeast valley!  If you're thinking about going to Robertos or Don Tortaco which are both relatively near, I suggest you think twice ;-)"}
{"text":"The Best menudo so delicious; everything is perfect; good flavor; clean place and friendly people"}
{"text":"My favorite go to Mexican food spot on the Blvd. Everything is cooked fresh and seasoned right."}
{"text":"Best Mexican food in Vegas and we've tried it all. We are now regulars and they know our order when we walk in. They have a salsa bar with three salsa options, limes and carrots. We haven't tried anything we didn't like. Our go to is the California burrito and carne Asada fries. The portions are great! I also recommend trying their beans! Delicious! Don't let the location scare you away!"}
