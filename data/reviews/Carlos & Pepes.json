{"text":"I just had a meal at Carlos and Pepe's for the first time in years. The wife and I had margaritas. They were perfectly made and had a rim made of a mixture of spices that made it so much better. Every time we come it's on a Saturday night. So happy to still see Noe serving, we always ask to sit in his section. He is so inviting and fun. He makes us feel like we are back in Mexico."}
{"text":"Bland, bland, bland. There is no flavor to be found here - just passable service. Keep walking."}
{"text":"Not sure why only 2 stars on yelp. Great food and drinks. Shout out to our waitress Barbara. Had a great time."}
{"text":"Worse than I remembered it...but that is comparing it to my University days

Food is greasy and uneventful. The drinks were so-so. Although it has a decent patio for people watching, I'd take a pass. There are way better restaurants/bars in Montreal."}
{"text":"Not very good, sadly. The portions were decent and the prices inexpensive, but the food is rather bland and not very exciting. I also had a piña colada and it was milky and and watery at the same time. Can't say I would return when I go back to Montreal."}
{"text":"It's been a long time since I came to Carlos and Pepe's and boy has it changed. I went upstairs to the bar for a quick bite before the Habs game and was shocked how beautiful the place was. The waiter told me they had just renovated and installed a new menu. I had the grilled chicken quesadillas and they were fantastic. Lots of beer choices now as well. wish I had more time, but will definitely be back."}
{"text":"If you haven't been to Carlos & Pepes since they renovated a couple of years ago, you should make plans to go.
The place looks awesome - both floors got a makeover so the place looks trendy and cozy, and a lot less cheesy than it used to. The menu's been updated, too, and now feels a lot less like Tex-Mex from a box. Drinks are good and reasonably priced - the cucumber mojito is delicious and goes well with just about anything you'll order. I found the meat in my Tacos Al Pastor a little tough, but I tend to be picky about that.  The Tacos Cochinita Pibil (one of my favourites anywhere) didn't disappoint. Plating is nicer than it used to be, and the portions are just as generous. Their salsa recipe hasn't changed, and I wouldn't want it to anyway.
Service is friendly, attentive without being distracting. The only issue I've had with service is that during a recent visit, our starters and mains were served to us at the same time. But it was Friday night and the kitchen was probably busy, so no big deal.
I used to go to Carlos & Pepes because I couldn't think of anyplace else to go - now I go there because I know I'll eat well and have a good time."}
{"text":"Nice Mexican food and drinks, right in the heart of Mtl, a super hot busboy made my night"}
{"text":"My first time in this place and not the last one, party atmosphere and great drinks, ( specially those margaritas) thanks luchio"}
{"text":"As Mexican I can attest the food is NOT authentic. Tip for the chef: Flautas are made with corn tortilla, flour tortillas are never fried (yuck). The enchiladas are made with stale corn tortillas, they probably think will hide that...and the guajillo salsa taste nothing like guajillo chile. Avoid!"}
{"text":"It's a total dive, but a wonderful dive. You don't come here expecting great service or great food - you come here because it's cheap, fun and it's a great place to kick off the night. I've been going here for years and I never regretted it - just don't delude yourself into thinking this is high-dining. It's a bar with Mexican food."}
{"text":"There aren't a lot of Mexican restaurants in downtown Montreal, but Carlos and Pepe's compensates for that with its size and adaptability. It's got a large, but still cozy, full-service restaurant on the main floor, while the second floor is more like a pub, though you can still get the same food there too, as well as specials. So it makes for an equally good night out for casual dining or drunken fiestas.

The food is generally good, though not outstanding. One caveat, though: Carlos and Pepe's has really bad guacamole. Instead of mashing it so that it stays thick and lumpy, they seem to puree it, which gives it a whipped, frothy texture which is a bit unappetizing to me, as well as being inauthentic."}
{"text":"The salsa was bland and the chips a bit stale. The food was pre-made and microwaved. The food was overly greasy and my salad looked a bit old.

The service was very slow after we received our food and it was not because it was busy since there were only about 4 more tables. I literally had to go look for my server to ask for the bill. 

Overpriced for what you get. Would not recommend."}
{"text":"If you are a visitor to Montreal.  Avoid this place like the plague.

My first impression was 'WOW\", there is a large crowd at this mexican restaurant both inside and out.  So this must be the spot for mexican food in Montreal.  \"FOOOOOOOOLLLLED YOU\", Darth Hemet voice from Spaceballs.

We were seated promptly upstairs and then came the chips and salsa test.  The salsa was not good.  It was bland and didnt have flavor.  The chips were on the border of being almost stale.  We should have walked away at this point.  Nope.  We ordered a margarita and a cadillac margarita.  AWFUL!  The drink came out with a lot of foam and neither my girlfriend nor I could taste and tequila.  All we tasted was the sweet and sour mix.  Plus there was a lot of foam at the top of the drink.  Weird.  I have never had a margarita with this amount of foam on top.  

We ordered one appetizer which was the combo.  Came with flautas (decent), chicken wings (good), potato skins (blah), and cheese quesidillas (decent).  The wings were the only good part of this meal.

The even worst part was when the bill came out.  42 bucks (including tip)!  Yeah a major rip off for two drinks and an appetizer.

I should have went with my gut and avoided a mexican restaurant in Montreal since I live in the mecca of great mexican food. SOCAL!  And the best part, I went to Don Jose this past tuesday and spent 30 bucks including tip and a cadillac margarita, three regular margaritas and a macho nachos. Ha!

Cheers."}
{"text":"Went here a year ago and had an amazing time with great good but this time around i was disappointed i didnt even finish my meal.

Drinks are moderately priced and so is the food. The waiter took 45 minutes to even approach the table and when she did she brought us chips and salsa( tasted like tomato sauce) and then she returned 20 minutes later to order. Food came out cold and bland.

Never again."}
{"text":"Chips and salsa, en gratis. Chips are super salty but the salsa is sweet and yummy and it's free so it's like complaining about Facebook. 

Server is a sweet, helpful, cutie but bar service is slower than Michael Johnson in the 150M against Donovan Bailey. Order a drink and when it comes order another upon delivery. 

Food is surprisingly good. Order the Scorpion drink. Tequila maks ebtnshg btr."}
{"text":"Je ne me souviens pas avoir aussi mal mangé à Montréal! Carlos & Pepes a déjà été une institution il y a 20 ans. On y allait pour l'ambiance, les burritos, les margaritas, etc.Eh bien bonjour la nostalgie! Depuis le changement d'administration, qui doit remonter à 2 ou 3 ans, le restau est devenu l'ombre de lui-même: la bière est tiède, la sauce des tortillas servis en entrée goute la sauce tomate en conserve, la bouffe clapote dans le gras de la plaque à cuisson, et la salade de choux nous fait réaliser que celle du St-Hubert n'est pas si mal après tout...
La serveuse nous a dit que c'était sa première journée- presque sur le ton d'un avertissement, annonçant que l'exprience risquait d'être catastrophique...Ce fut le cas.
À éviter."}
{"text":"Food: 1.5/5
The food here is not real Mexican food. The portions were very small too. You will probably be hungry if you only order a main course. It tastes like the Mexican food you make at home with the ingredients you buy at the local generic grocery store. 

As the portions were not generous, the taste was mediocre as it was not the worst, nor super flavorful. It tastes kind of like something you might expect when you order from a food court at the mall. 

The drinks that were ordered were pretty good though. 

Price: 2/5
Again, the servings were small. For what was ordered and the quality of it, it was not worth it at all. 
For example, the quesadilla is ~17$ and it is just one pita folded in half with a little serving of rice of rice on the plate. There was barely any filling in it either. You feel a bit ripped off when you finish your meal and pay for what you ate.  



Service: 4/5
Service was good overall. The table was a bit dirty but was soon cleaned . The bill did take long to receive, but there was not a lot of staff available and a big  group, so it was understandable.


Other:
Overall, not worth it. This was the fifth time I have been here in a few years, and most likely will be the last time. Previous experiences included ordering a lunch special doesn't come with the \"included soup\"  while they bring you the main course because they don't have any left. I only see the \"Taco special\" being remotely worth it here. If you want Mexican food, check out the other restaurants other than here or 3 Amigos!"}
{"text":"Absolutely horrible dining experience. I didn't realize we had to know French fluently to be able to order. The menu was entirely in French and Our waiter, after waiting for over 15 minutes to simply ask for drinks and an appetizer, seemed in a very big rush to get our order as there was only two servers for a full restaurant, and was very unhelpful and rude in translating the parts of menu. He brushed off most of our questions. It then took over 30 minutes for our appetizer of TWO tacos. And 50 minutes for our main dishes to come out. Waiter never attended to us or asked if we needed anything or if everything was okay. Food was okay but the customer service was terrible. If you're in the mood to wait close to an hour for your food to come out, then this place is perfect."}
{"text":"Staff,ambiance and cleanings was superb!!! But make no mistake, this place has absolutely nothing Mexican to it!!

I lived in Mexico for 10 years and my wife is Mexican. We stopped in with the hopes of a nice drink and a good taco. Not the case, opening chips and salsa should have been the dead giveaway! I won't go into to great details shredding the food....this is a great place to grab a drink and that's it!"}
{"text":"Back in the days Carlos&Pepes was a great restaurant. But a couple of years ago they changes ownership and the place lost the prestige from back then. It used to be the spot back in the days. Plates were full all the time... You would never finish the plate. But NOW... MY GOD.... The increased the prices and they give less food that is bland, no taste whatsoever... I don't like 3 Amigos so I can't tell you to go there... I just have mexican food at Taco Bell, taste better then at Carlos seriously.... Sad cause that used to be my favorite spot. Chicken Chimichangas was the bomb back in the days...."}
{"text":"J'aime y aller les mercredi et dimanche pour profiter de l'offre fajitas à 1/2 prix, soit 8$. Les margharitas sont excellentes!"}
{"text":"A completely awful meal!  We happened upon this place when strolling downtown.  I was intrigued by the decor but after that it goes down hill. Even the salsa and chips were lacking.  Very peppery, chips are Frito like and no Mexican flavors at all.  I hoped the meal would be better but the Chimichanga I ordered was bathed in what tasted more like aurora sauce and the meat was swimming in oil with a tomato sauce.  My daughter had the enchiladas and they were smothered in a very poor excuse for mole sauce, even worse than from a jar.  It was a waste of money and we left hungry but our plates were full!"}
{"text":"This place is horrible.  Our hotel concierge recommended it to us because it was after 9pm but I would have rather just starved and drank at a bar.  The food was horrible and the margarita was all green sour mix.  I wouldn't even eat here if it was the only place open and I was starving."}
{"text":"Good is great, especially for the price. Beer prices are good also. You get what you pay for; this is a very basic restaurant, nothing fancy but if you are into some good food and cheap beers this is a definite winner. Sunday's they have dollar tacos, a huge plus for those on the student budget."}
{"text":"Well my last review was in 2013 we are now 2015 and I must say the renovation to the place is amazing! Very trendy look, luminous in comparison to my last visit of course! Believe it or not I thought I was entering  the wrong place lol. 

The food was as good as remembered it from the last time and the service was actually quick and my waitress was great.

The pricing always super reasonable for what you get and quality is certifiably perfect!


Carlos & Pepe keep up the good work and see you pretty soon"}
{"text":"Don't have the tacos. Service is good but the food us pretty terrible. The only person to like their food was eating the chimichanga. Tacos are awful."}
{"text":"Not sure as to all the negative reviews,  I was in town for a class and walked by looking for lunch.  The service was prompt and the Mexican flag dish (enchiladas)  were good and tasty. May just be my good fortune but I liked it."}
{"text":"Bien gentil bonne salade césar! Allez y"}
{"text":"J'y vais depuis des lustres et  j'aime toujours y aller. C'est pas de la haute gastronomie mexicaine mais la bouffe est bonne et l'atmosphère sympathique et sans prétentions. J'y retourné régulièrement avec plaisir avec des amis. C'est jouer un peu safe, il n'y a pas grand risque  y aller mais si on veut pas se casser la tête, on risque d'y passer un bon moment."}
{"text":"New decor. No more free chips and salsa when you sit down.  The beer list seams not bad at first glance but then you're told that you must visit the second floor for 60% of the beer listed. 
Overall a change for the worse."}
{"text":"Atmosphere was fun and food actually was not bad, but unfortunately it took an hour and fifteen minutes to get our food and it all didn't come out correctly.

We arrived at 8pm with only two other parties in the restaurant.  We ordered easy items, salads and quesadillas, and our food came to the table around 920.  The waitress was friendly, so I thought maybe it was just the pace of the restaurant or neighborhood until the order didn't come out correctly.  I ordered taco salad, which was supposed to have cheese, avocado/guac, corn, tomato, and other typical taco toppings.  I asked for no tomato and no corn, and somehow it showed up with tomato and without avocado or cheese.  It was a good size salad but for the cost it should have at least come with the right toppings.

One of our dishes was missing a side of fries, which the waitress realized as she was picking up our dishes to clear the table.  Then our queso came out as chili.  I  thought maybe the kitchen team was just off their game until we watched our beverages just sit at the bar for 10 minutes.

If the food had come out correctly I could have brushed the wait time aside.  It's a shame because the taste wasn't bad and it had potential to be a fun evening."}
{"text":"The service here was EXCEPTIONAL. We had a margarita, a pina colada & 3 beef tacos from the $1 Sunday Taco menu. Tacos were good, especially for the price, drinks were delicious - the waiter made a smiley face on the pina colada, super cute! The staff were super attentive & personable. Would definitely recommend."}
{"text":"DON'T BOTHER, NOT WORTH THE WAIT. Came on a Tuesday night for a friends birthday, waited 1 hour 15 minutes before even getting our DRINKS. They never brought water to our table, and when one of our party arrived late, no one came to take their order and they ended up not eating for fear it would take too long to get food. Finally when the food came AN HOUR AND FOURTY MINUTES after ordering it, the food was okay at best."}
{"text":"I came for their $3/4 tacos on Monday and I was pleasantly surprised. Their tacos were quite good for it's price. Their complimentary chips are alright, nothing super special but nice to munch on while waiting for our food. I would definitely recommend coming for their Monday taco deal since you really get your bang for your buck. *There are no vegetarian options for their tacos and as well some of the tacos like shrimp and tuna are not included in the deal*"}
{"text":"The food is so so and really depends on the day. Sometimes good, sometimes really bad. Food usually comes fast and the service is good (there is a girl who is very friendly) But last week I had the unfortunate encounter with this old waiter guy. When we changed our minds to sit inside instead of the terrace he gave a very rude look. Snapped up the menu before I could even order a drink. Did not bring salsa and chips. Never came by to check up on us. 
It is time to look for another mexican restaurant in downtown."}
{"text":"Garage service with  cold soggy food,, sent that back and left only paying my drinks! Been going for more than 15 years to this spot,, but tonight was the last straw,,"}
{"text":"Finally! A place where I can taste the tequila in the margaritas. As a Mexican, I will say this place is good enough to be in San Antonio but maybe not Mexico. Still enjoyed it !"}
{"text":"Well its finally reached its end, at least i think so. Carlos and Pepes used to be an ok place to go for some average Mexican cuisine, and a nice hang out for all after work in the downtown area. came here for a snack with a friend and my goodness it had changed, the atmosphere is all but completely gone and the food is over priced and terrible, I could of done better at Taco Bell if I had know this place took a nose dive. I am so disappointed."}
{"text":"Service was very slow to start. I sat at the bar as I was alone and was ready to walk out when server finally took my order. Food arrived quickly but was only warm and not to flavourful. It was close to my hotel but I would likely not give it a second try."}
{"text":"My meal was good but I was severely disappointed in the salsa. It was just so bizarre compared to the countless other restaurant salsas I've had this is definitely my least favorite. I also think they should add a simple queso dip to their menu. The food was good and our waiter was great but they could definitely improve some things"}
{"text":"If you need a Mexican food fix - this place should hold you over.
I've lived in San Antonio for many years so my comps prove to be tough competitors.  The place is ok the margarita did not provide much of a kick.  I would go back."}
{"text":"Opened since 1984, Carlos & Pepe's Restaurant is one of the few Mexican restaurants in Montreal, and while it's more North-American than actual Mexican food, the food is delicious. They serve plentiful portions and the shrimp taco was really good."}
{"text":"This place wasn't bad. But it wasn't great. Very status quo. The menu is very extensive, they have a good selection of Tex-Mex dishes and drinks. The service was friendly. Other than that there was nothing that really stuck out about this place. If you are looking for average Tex-Mex this place is for you."}
{"text":"Carlos & Pepes used to be a great place to go for cheap $1 tacos on Sundays. After their renovation, they've turned it into an extremely loud bar environment with poor service. The $1 tacos are now $2 with less food (no side rice) and fewer fillings (absolutely do not order the vegetarian tacos - what used to be beans and vegetables is now just corn and avocado). It may have been an issue that we were there on St Patricks Day but I've heard similar reviews from other people who have gone. I used to go to Carlos & Pepes every Sunday and now I'm sure that I will not return."}
{"text":"I prefer it way more than tres amigos and the drinks are good but the stairs not so much"}
{"text":"What a cool place!! Almost makes me feel like I'm in Mexico  the staff is very welcoming and fun to be around. Haven't tried there food yet but I'm sure it wouldn't let me down! Came here today for my girlfriends birthday and they made it really fun. All around a great place to get a cool take on some common cocktails, won't be my last time coming here"}
{"text":"Je peu pas dire que je suis un grand fan. J'y suis retourner par nostalgie car certaines soirées de jeunesse bien arrosés s'y sont autrefois déroulées. Mais bon, la cuisine elle est restée dans le temps. Ingrédients douteux, apparence des plats désagréable et service au mieux correcte, je crois que c'est l'endroit parfait pour le manger mou si on vraiment pas regardant sur les saveurs."}
{"text":"So we got into Montreal really late due to traffic and we were starving and Carlos and Pepes was the closest restaurant to our hotel so that's where we ate.  We should have just kept walking.

So it starts out good: We were greeted promptly at the door and lead to our table.  The host brings us our menus with a basket of tortilla chips and salsa.  Nice, right?  Well, the chips were not so much chips as crumbs and broken bits.  But we were hungry so we appreciated the promptness of anything edible.  The salsa was all blended and looked like spaghetti sauce.  Some people may like this style of salsa, but I prefer the chunky cubes of tomatoes.  It's really difficult to eat chip crumbs with \"spaghetti sauce\" but it was free and edible, so whatever.  As a side note, we later got a re-fill of the chips and salsa and our second basket was actual unbroken chips.     

So the waitress comes and pours us some water and takes our drink orders.  I had the large (28 oz) daiquiri with 2 oz of alcohol (a little over $10) and my husband had some sort of beer (I'm not a beer drinker, so I can't be more specific).  Then I ordered the mole beef enchiladas (was like around $13) and my husband ordered the chicken and ribs (around $17).  

Now I hate sesame seeds, and if I'm going to an Asian place or if I'm ordering something that I think might have sesame seeds in them, I let the server know that I don't want sesame seeds.  I figured that at a Tex-Mex place ordering enchiladas, I didn't have to say anything.  Imagine my surprise when my Mole Enchiladas came with sesame seeds sprinkled on top!  Now Carlos & Pepes is not a \"fusion\" restaurant or some frou-frou place.  It's like a Mexicali Rosa's or Lonestar.  I have no idea what sesame seeds were doing on my Mole Enchilada.  Anyway, my fault for not mentioning it I guess.  So just be warned if you have the same sentiments as I do about sesame seeds.

The mole sauce on my enchiladas was runny and not tasty at all.  The enchiladas were small with very little beef filling.  The refried beans were actually not bad.  They were covered in cheese and had a nice spicy kick to them.  The rice tasted like Uncle Ben's rice and had vegetables that probably came from a frozen bag in them (corn, peas and carrots).  The \"salad\" that it came with was a sorry excuse for salad.  It was strips of romaine with shredded carrot and pieces of olives in a disgusting creamy dressing (tasted like milk past its expiry date).  At least there wasn't any iceberg lettuce in it!       

My husband's chicken was dry and the ribs were unremarkable.  Fries were just ok.  My daiquiri tasted like it didn't have any alcohol in it, but that might be because it was so diluted with the 28 oz of slush.  

Our dinner with taxes and tip was a little over $65.  Totally not worth it.  We should have gone to McDonald's (I would have said Taco Bell, but there are no Taco Bells in Quebec).

If you happen to walk by Carlos & Pepes, I suggest you keep on walking.  Sorry."}
{"text":"Meh...this is the word that describes this place. The service was good and the waitress was attentive and very nice. 
I ordered a frozen margarita and opted for the 4oz. Of alcohol because I'm a boozer and I wanted to impress the waitress as she was hot. It arrived and the flavor was decent but not what I would expect and not the big fruit flavor I was after. Also they put salt on the rim, I know I perhaps should have asked for sugar but how about giving me the option. Oh well. Chips and salsa are NOT free here. Very strange. This is the standard pretty much everywhere,  granted they are only a loonie  (less than $1USD for you roobs) but still. 
The chips and salsa came right out, the salsa is not spicy almost sweet infact. 

I ordered steak fajitas it's almost as if they cook the steak and then season it. I don't know why they don't marinate the steak but I'm not the owner of the place so maybe I shouldn't throw stones. The fajitas are ok nothing special and not as good as 3 Amigos on St. CATHERINE. 
They have outdoor seating and offer some creative drinks but this place isn't up to snuff."}
{"text":"Perhaps our fault for coming to a cliche Mexican restaurant in Montreal when we are from Texas, but this place was disappointing.

1. If you are trying to be authentic, make your own salsa. Pace picante sauce does not qualify. It is never good when no one wants to even eat the chips and salsa.
2. If you have mole on the menu, it should come with corn tortillas. When we asked for some, they brought us hard shell tacos?
3. Make your own tortillas. Store bought tortillas taste like....store bought tortillas.

Don't bother. The food is WAY too bland."}
{"text":"I went with a friend. We arrived at 7:00 and sat at our table for 15 minutes before the server greeted us and got our drink order, then waited 10 minutes for our drinks even though we could see them on the bar counter. It took 45 minutes for us to recieve our order. My friend got cold tacos with coagulated mole sauce that tasted only of chocolate. I got bacon and chorizo quesadillas that were actually quite good, but the portion was very small for $15 and there was barely any cheese in them. When we were finished, it took another 20 minutes for our server to print the checks, despite sitting across from the computer. my food was good, but I tried my friend's cold tacos and they were terrible. This combined with the terribly slow service, I don't think that we will return."}
{"text":"My very first thought is to ask for Noe to serve you. He is easily the best waiter we have had in a very long time. When we were finished our meal I called over the manager to tell him how great the service was.   The manager was so gracious and extremely happy to hear his server is terrific.  He actually treated us to a round of drinks - what a lovely surprise!
The decor in here is a lot of fun, The music is good and the food is well priced. Our portions were absolutely huge.  You are immediately given warm nacho chips with salsa when you get served.   We started our meal with jalapeno poppers and a couple of cold beers.   I had beef enchiladas with the mole sauce & a salad, he had 2 really good Blue Demon soft tacos (huge shrimp in a tequila sauce) with Mexican rice that he really thought was good.
It was actually our first time here, we will absolutely come again. It's just a great atmosphere to have a cold beer and a taco :-)"}
{"text":"Idéalement situé en centre ville, c'est la place idéale pour des lunchs ou 5@7 entre collègues.
Les plats sont très bons, variés, il y a la possibilité de se faire une petite tournée de shooters avant, pendant et/ou après le repas! :)
Ambiance conviviale, chaleureuse, les serveurs sont sympas, dispos, et vous passerez un bon moment à la mode mexicaine!"}
{"text":"So, I had the pleasure of eating at a mexican restaurant in Old Montreal last time I came into town.  Our Rue Peel restaurant hopping this week brought us to Carlos and Pepes on Tuesday night before hitting the Metro.   Truly, I wish we had skipped it.

The margarita was not good, the mix was almost teal in color and tasted as if it had been around the bar for far too long under the counter.  The meal included beef nachos for my friend and I had the roasted vegetable quesadilla topped with guac.  

My friends guacamole is not green brown!  Salsa does not have the flavor of strawberry jam!  Quesadillas are not simply heated flour tortillas stuffed with stuff.  Indigestion began almost as soon as we walked out the door and lasted till today!

Not my favourite dining experience in town so sorry to say."}
{"text":"I thought the food was great and it came out within 15 minutes! I ordered the vegetarian burrito wrap, which came with seasoned string fries and cole slaw and my bf ordered the Santo tacos, which he said were tasty and spicy. We didn't enjoy their salsa, it tasted like tomato jam to me! it was really sweet. The chips weren't bad (I wish they would have been warm though). Our waiter was nice, but as it started to get busier as we were eating, we didn't get drink refills or chip refills. If you're looking for casual Mexican food or just a marg, I would recommend this place. Enjoy xo"}
{"text":"Very gimmicky. They have a nice area for large parties but it's not the best mexican restaurant. It's kinda dirty and the service weird. It's loud and the food isn't spectacular. I would not recommend it."}
{"text":"God food. The salsas are spicy enough. I found it strange that a \"Mexican\" restaurant does not have refried beans. Attentive service, friendly staff. Close enough if you are looking for Mexican food."}
{"text":"If you are looking for good Mexican food this restaurant is not the place to go!
I hd the chicken fajitas and it didn't taste anything like it."}
{"text":"0 stars doesn't exist? This place deserves none. DESERVES TO CLOSE DOWN. Disgusting,  run down, nasty restaurant (not in a good way). Makes you wait 1h30 for a dry mexi burger & fries?! Complained to the hipster \"manager\" (probably from the Plateau?...) Didn't make us pay a cent. Definitely didn't give a penny to our doofus, brain dead, pot smoking, \"don't give a f**k\" attitude, slob of a waiter (not worthy of being called a server).
Never again.
Look at my pics of this disgusting place.
Stay away...don't bring your children! 
3 Amigos is better than this."}
{"text":"Décevant. Il y avait des lustres que je n'avais pas mis les pieds ici et nous y avons fait une halte au bar à l'étage pour le \"happy hour\". Les margarits ne sont pas très cher (pour 24 oz, mais seulement 2 oz d'alcool) mais ils n'ont rien d'authentiques. Ils utilisent un mélange vert qui fait plus penser à du \"kool-aid\" qu'à du jus. D'ailleurs la plupart des clients (des boomers presque exclusivement) présents étaient à la bière (cela aurait dû être un indice). L'ambiance est correcte (genre bar sportif) ainsi que le service."}
{"text":"While a lot of sit-down restaurants were closed until dinner time (5PM), this place was open. It was cheap and gives you free chips and salsa, but the salad was watered down. In fact, all the food we order were pretty average and bland. Definitely not like the authentic Mexican food you can get in Los Angeles."}
{"text":"My kids and I ventured in here for lunch one day last month. We were starving and wandering the construction-laden streets of downtown. I remember Carlos and Pepes from 30+ years ago (there were a few other locations back then); my CEGEP friends and I used to dine at C&P \"back in the day\" when we were in the mood for Mex fare. Glad to see it was still around, with the same logo and everything. 

This restaurant interior looked totally new to me. Dim but trendy. \"Hip\". 

Service was slow but they brought out warm tortilla chips right away with a few different salsas. 

I had a salad with chicken and it was fantastic! My kids shared an enchilada with all the usual sides. They liked it but it was the typical Americanized Mexican fare. Living now in the States, we are more used to authentic Mex fare. 

I should note that the guys at the next booth ordered nachos and the dish was shockingly HUGE, like a mountain. Enough for 4-5 adults to share, easy. In fact, all the portions here are quite generous

The bathroom on the main floor (downstairs, by the dining area) was a mess. I'm guessing it's there to accommodate handicapped folks who can't make it up the stairs to the primary bathrooms. Well, the facilities downstairs was grim and dark, housing various cleaning supplies. It was more of a utility closet than a bathroom, really, but at least the toilet was functional and there was t.p.(Upstairs the womens' washroom was nicer, thankfully, but the music piped in upstairs was SO loud)."}
{"text":"Not a place I will EVER set foot in!

Chips were dunk in salt I believe and barely eatable; so much jalapenos in my tacos I tasted nothing else for the rest of the meal!

The worse, was the service! Forgot my diet pepsi, took back my friend's margarita glass with a few swigs still in and didn't get a thank you or even acknowledgement after payment!

Oh, and it was sweltering hot in there, and the facilities were gross."}
{"text":"Horrible food... I went there because my friend was feeling for \" Mexican\" food, and it was either Carlos & Pepe's or 3 Amigos. I preferred Carlos & Pepe's but after today, I will never return. The service was extremely slow, and when my food arrived it was a potion for a 5 yr old, cold and they had the audacity to serve frozen spinach in my vegetarian enchiladas. I only gave 1 star because I couldn't enter 0."}
{"text":"We got food from here during the Grand Prix weekend and I have been unable to get the Tacos out of my head!!  

We ordered beef & chicken tacos and the meat, seasoning and flavours were perfect!! 
Can not wait to go again and try more things from the menu!"}
{"text":"I enjoyed Carlos & Pepe's each of the times I have been there, they have fantastic deals to get you in (drinks AND food) and the quality of the food meets expectations. 

If you're paying a dollar per taco, don't expect something gourmet, it's a taco. Good place to fill your belly and have a beer, ambiance is good and service is good."}
{"text":"This restaurant is a little over-rated. It's almost impossible to have a table unless you have a reservation. Their salsa has strawberries in it, which I think is particularly strange. The food was average. Not Taco Bell, but not 100% Mexican either."}
{"text":"Bad service, bad food. But it's cheap at least ! 
The waiters are very unfriendly and don't know what to recommend / size of the plates / any information about the food. I like the locker decoration but that's about it"}
{"text":"Je ne recommande pas ce restaurant, la nourriture est vraiment très mauvaise. Je recommande cherche un cuisinier mexicain ou latino-américaine.

I do not recommend this restaurant, the food is really very bad. 

No es un restaurant que recomendaria, realmente la comida es muy mala."}
{"text":"We ate here our first night in Montreal.  We were tired from travel, and stopped at the first place that looked yummy near our hotel.  Anyway, we loved this place!  We were seated immediately, and our waiter was quick and friendly.  Loved the huge variety of vegetarian options on the menu, and my shrimp fajitas were great.  My husband had veggie chili nachos which looked fab as well.  The beans were awesome.  Really nice decor and ambience as well.  Highly recommend."}
{"text":"Awful, simply awful, disgusting, foul, atrocious, malodorous!  Cheesy decor, sangria from a bottle, crummy salsa and chips.  My burrito was the size of a banana and came out so fast and hot it had to be nuked.  My wife's enchiladas were microscopic.  Simply atrocious.  à éviter!!!! à éviter!!!! à éviter!!!!!"}
{"text":"Went to Montreal for the weekend and I was looking for a spot with great Mexican food and music. This place was spot on for both. When in Montreal and you want to eat dance and drink this is the place."}
{"text":"Pretty nice Classic Poutine.

Tacos were expensive and average quality. Definitely overpriced tacos! 

Also they should have soft corn & wheat taco options.

Service was good."}
{"text":"Just wanting to grab a quick bite to eat before adventuring out in the city, we came across this place.  There is a nice patio out front, so that's a plus.  The servers are friendly so that's another plus.  Pretty much all the pluses I can think of.

The food is mediocre at best.  I had the small tacos (fish/shrimp) b/c nothing sounded or looked particularly good (from what I saw other tables getting).  The tacos were ok, but no real flavour to them.  If you were really hungry, they'd hit the spot.

There are way better Mexican places in the city."}
{"text":"Carlos and Pepe was ok. It wasn't horrible but it wasn't the best Mexican food we have had. My husband and I decided to come here after walking around downtown and it was actually one of the only places we had seen that actually had lunch prices (I.e. $8-$12 per meal). A lot of the other places we saw wanted to charge the same price for lunch that they charge for dinner. 

We were greeted by a friendly staff and seated quickly. We went at lunch time hence I wanted actual lunch prices. Lol. We were served chips and salsa to start, and I ordered a side of cheese dip. The chips and dips were good. We also ordered a side salad and my husband ordered a cup of soup. They were also ok. For our lunch meal we both ordered chicken enchiladas. The meal wasn't bad. It was good for a quick lunch but wasn't the best Mexican we had by far. However, it was crowded around lunch time. Maybe they have good drinks. I don't know because I'm pregnant and can't drink so umm yeah! Lol. 

Overall, Carlos & Pepes wasn't bad. It was good for a quick lunch but don't expect it to be the best Mexican cuisine you have have. It didn't even taste authentic or did not have a homemade taste. Just your typical Tex-Mex place."}
{"text":"The food was really good . the prices are fine for most of the stuff but it can be a little bit expensive too . 
I ordered a cheesecake and I was pretty disappointed because it was pretty much like ice and it was too hard to eat . I still really enjoy eating at this restaurant, I ordered chicken tacos and it was delicious and the portions were big , unlike the burrito . So I really recommend this place !"}
{"text":"Honestly if I could give them zero stars I would. The service is TERRIBLE! We placed our food and drink orders, waited 25mins to get flat pop, came back 5 mins later to tell us they don't have what we ordered. 45 mins later I ask where our appetizer of nachos is and they say it's coming. An hour later they changed my friends pop orders from the flat pop they received the first time around. 5 mins later (we're at an hour waiting for these) they brought out our nachos, we asked where our meals were, they were waiting for the nachos. Excuse me, an hour to make nachos??? Meanwhile we're watching people who arrived way after us receive their full orders. Finally, an hour and fifteen mins later we AGAIN (for the fourth time) speak to someone who wouldn't identify them self, as staff or manager- when I specifically requested the manager. He stated \"I'm the man in trouble\". So yup, we all tell him we're hungry and want our food now! It's been an hour and twenty minutes. An hour and half later we all decided to walk out. I was extremely pissed and made it known it was THE WORST SERVICE IVE EVER RECEIVED! The guy who was \"the one in trouble\" continued to put his hands on me while talked after I continued to tell him to stop touching me. I had my hand up to signify STOP and I verbally stated many many times STOP TOUCHING ME. He didn't want to listen and my friend stepped in and told him, stop touching him. He finally listened. As we were walking out the door he decided to follow me out and AGAIN continued to lay his hands on me. I told him to leave me alone and stop touching me, I was leaving. Needless to say, he did not leave me alone, followed me outside and tried to tell me *my behaviour was inappropriate. Excuse me, you continued to touch me when I repeatedly asked you not to (I never once touched him, there was absolutely no need for it!), he tried telling me he apologized and that should have been enough. I told him his apologies don't feed us, your lies about our food coming doesn't feed us, we're done and leaving. And then *finally* he mentions he was going to \"comp our meal\". Too late we've walked out. 

I watched some of our friends who arrived after us and sat at a different table order their food, eat their food, pay for their food and leave within the hour and we were still sitting there waiting for our damn nachos. Ridiculous! 

I will NEVER EVER RETURN to this restaurant nor will I ever recommend someone goes there solely based on the customer service cause well we barely got to eat any food!"}
{"text":"Nothing to write home about. I had the steak fajitas and tasted pretty much like standard Mexican. Their salsa wasn't good. It had a strange sweetness to it, like they added cinnamon or something. One positive is the environment was enjoyable and had a unique feel to it.  Other than that, this just seems like another Mexican restaurant."}
{"text":"The Margaritas are the best I've had in MTL. They have great weekly specials and great decor. The tequila and mezcal selection is large so you have a lot to choose from."}
{"text":"Just left this terrible place.  First a complement on the decor, the bar is pretty and the rustic wood wall is pretty, along with the different colored lights.  
That is the only positive thing I have to say about this restaurant.  The server was not attentive nor interested in our satisfaction.  My husband ordered a michelada (which we drink frequently in Texas) which was terrible.  The drink sat on the table and watered down because it was not drinkable.  My husband ordered a coke and the waiter did not even ask about why we did not drink the michelada.  When my husband asked for more tomato juice to try to Doctor the michelada the waiter replied rudely, you should have ordered a  similar drink which was called the \"red eye.\"  Again no offer to take the drink back or attempt to fix the problem. 
I ordered white wine which was served so warm I had to put ice in it, yuck.  I ordered the seared tuna salad for my entree. After waiting about 20 minutes the waiter then came to the table to inform us there was no tuna left and handed me a menu to choose something else.  Honestly at this point I was already frustrated and decided not to order an entree.  My husband ordered the steak sandwich which had 6 pieces of fajita type meat on top of a unremarkable hoagie with a load of vegetables and weird orange sauce, not good.  Also, mysteriously my previously ordered salad appeared with no tuna....??? I didn't order that.  My husband had to beg for a coke refill( not free by the way)  and we had to get up and ask for the check at the end of the meal.  
While I was inspecting the check, the waiter called out from across the room that the salad was not on the check.  Okay I thought but I'm still going to look, I found a $8.50 charge for a beer we did not order.  Again, we had to wait while that charge was removed.  I still paid for the disgraceful michelada which had 2 sips taken out of it.  Save yourself and go somewhere else for your Mexican experience.
PS: My husband is Mexican and we are visiting from Texas. There is nothing authentic about this place, just as a side point."}
{"text":"I had never eaten here for fear of experiencing the \"morning after\" that people talk about after eating mexican food. Luckily for me I was served by friends of mine who were able to help me navigate the unnecessarily large menu of drinks and distinguish between some of the food options. The first time we went the food was delicious, but a visit yesterday showed that the inconsistency means that it isn't always so tasty. The service was wonderful even when it wasn't people I know, and the decor is great, including the kitchen door stating that if you trespass you'll be turned into a taco. Overall it's a decent place when you consider the other mexican options in Montreal, could use a bit more consistency on the food and preferably a smaller formatted drink menu."}
{"text":"The service at this restaurant is horrible. How does a waiter spill your drink and not come to wipe it up. I'm never going back here and no one should go either. Been sitting here for 30mins and our waiter hasn't even checked to see if everything is ok. Why should I spend my money here. HORRIBLE HORRIBLE!! I've eaten at this one many years ago and i won't be back. So much for an easy Saturday lunch!!!"}
{"text":"Came here on a early dinner, and the service was disgusting. This is not even close to traditional mexican food. The food is like it came out of a freezer and microwaved. I could of done it myself at home for cheaper. It's a really shady place, and looks dirty. 
Menu is not worth the time reading, the portions are smaller then my iPhone. 

I would not bring kids, yourself, or a bad date your trying to ditch. It's not a place you wanna go eat, avoid it at all costs and spend your money somewhere else."}
{"text":"Great restaurant, waiters speak spanish, they are nice, excellent food, good music. Prices are not high."}
{"text":"I've been here a few times and its never been anything special, sometimes even not good.  Dollar tacos and dollar beers night is good though.  I wouldn't get anything else but the tacos here.  I'd only come back here for the dollar special."}
{"text":"Idéal pour les soirs de match de hockey! Une ambiance extraordinaire, des margaritas très grosses et très bonnes! Côté menu, tout ce qu'on peut espérer d'un mexicain, avec des tacos, enchiladas, et burritos, sans trop de coriandre merci :)
En été, petite terrasse à deux pas de la rue Sainte Catherine qui permet de prendre un verre au soleil sans le vacarme de la rue tout en profitant de l'ambiance McGilloise (Ça se dit?)
Un bar sur 2 étages bien plus sympa qu'une certaine chaîne mexicaine que je ne nommerai pas. Et puis ça change de la bière un peu d'exotisme!"}
{"text":"Salads are great & so tasty! It is easy to change ingredients (add/remove items) for no extra charge. On the other side, cocktails don't seem to have alcohol in them... I would not go back for alcohol... nor the salsa; For a mexican restaurant it is very watery, and not full of flavours.

I've also seen better service... You have to ask for what's missing on your table, cause waiters don't come and ask if everything is ok throughout the meal (at least the 3 times I went). 

I would not go there for a friend's night out, but for a salad during lunch time."}
{"text":"Went to this place for my birthday with a party of about 12 after reading some fairly decent reviews about it. Took 20 minutes for a waiter to even acknowledge our presence and take our order. Food was decent but not worth the wait. Cocktails are HUUUGGEE and mostly ice and sugar with little to no alcohol. Still on a hunt for some decent Mexican food in Montreal..."}
{"text":"I wish a could give them ZERO stars!! Don't go here unless you plan to vandalize the place or rip them off. 

Never have I ever been treated so poorly in any restaurant! The wait staff barely greeted us upon arrival or acknowledged our presence during the duration of our stay (the restaurant was not busy when we got there).  Our server took his time to approach us for an initial order, then it took roughly 15 minutes to get our drinks. We ordered civiche to share, expecting that since it is a cold dish, it would be prompt....but we were very wrong. 

After we waited a half hour for our cold appetizer, we noticed customers at the tables around us were also wondering where their food was, and not hearing what the servers' responses were, I asked as politely as possible when our dish was coming, to which the server snarled some inaudible response at me and bolted to the back of the restaurant. 

The chips were stale and broken into crumbs and the salsa was very bland. When we ran out of chips and finished our mojitos no one asked if we wanted more chips or another round of drinks. I cannot attest to the quality of the ceviche or any entrées because we ended up leaving after an hour of being ignored and having that server snarl at me."}
{"text":"If you think you found a place to eat tasty Mexican food with excellent service...you're better off dining at your local Taco Bell.

My wife and I came in to this place thinking we'd have an enjoyable mojito with an appetizer.  We were first \"greeted\" by a very annoyed server who sat us down.  The chips and salsa that were brought out were not the best, the chips were better off eaten by themselves rather than being dipped in their bland concoction they call salsa.  No biggie, chips and salsa are not why we came here, we then proceeded to order our drinks and appetizer.

After a good twenty minutes of waiting our server finally returned with our drinks (and mind you they were not too terribly busy) and that was the last time we ever saw our server.  We continued to wait an additional 45 minutes for our appetizer, that never arrived.  We noticed that other tables around us were asking about their food orders but were blown off by the wait staff.  My wife waited and then asked the same question to one of the servers and his only response was to mumble and walk away.

My advice is to skip this place and spend your money at far better restaurants in the area."}
{"text":"I took a walk late this afternoon along rue Sainte-Catherine. I was getting hungry and it was suppertime. 

Carlos & Pepe's caught my eye (it's off rue Sainte-Catherine on Peel). 

 The restaurant is on the main floor and the pub is on the second floor. You have to climb a mountain of stairs to get to the pub (this is looking up at them) but that's where I headed. 

It's a cute place.  There were only two tables of two people when I got there ... it was getting busy when I left. They have happy hour drink specials 'til 7pm. 

You are given warm tortilla chips and salsa when you sit down to munch on. 

I ordered Rio Grande Chicken Burrito ... rather than salad, I got extra rice.   It was good and really filling ... I finished the burrito but couldn't eat all the rice.   The burrito must have been part of happy hour pricing because I was surprised was the bill came and the burrito was less than $8. 

I liked the food and the atmosphere ... I'd recommend it if you are craving a burrito. My one complaint would be with the service. My server was very unengaged. Though he wasn't rude, he wasn't friendly at all which is too bad considering he works in a restaurant."}
{"text":"Then it was Happy Hour across the street at Carlos & Pepe's, a gigantic Mexican restaurant that looks like a little hole in the wall place from the front. I had a margarita as big as my head for $9, fantastic deal for Canada. The color reminded me of Ecto-Cooler a bit and it was kinda sour, but pretty good nonetheless. Honestly, I have yet to find a great margarita in Canada but I've learned that you just can't judge them by the same standards (yes, I know the US isn't Mexico, but we have some damn good Mexican food and beverages). I ordered the enchiladas (just wait for my Montreal-wide review of enchiladas), and the plate was called the Mexican Flag: one chicken, one cheese, and one spinach with red sauce. It was effing delicious! Definitely a great place to check out, especially during happy hour!"}
{"text":"First of let me say that this is better then the other restaurant in Laval centropolis. I took the enchilada, weren't to bad but not that inspiring also. I felt I could have made something better at home.My gf took the fajitas plate, the chicken was moist and well seasoned, but they barely give cheese which I don't really understand. The chips and salsa are good here though, the chips taste home made, not oily and well salted.

The drinks here are the real star, take the 4 oz margarita, hey if it's your birthday you get a somprero I think! Sorry I forgot to take photo, will do next time."}
{"text":"Spent 20$ on drinks and they forgot to put tequila in both the margaritas. what's that about"}
{"text":"So I comhowe here often, I just found out that they are cheap with the chips. You now have to pay $2 extra for the small basket after the first round. Kinda sucks Considering that you are paying for a meal and drink. #howrestoslosetheirclients"}
{"text":"Friends and I were wondering and needed a place to eat in the area. We needed real food (as opposed to bar food) so we find Carlos & Pepes. Yes, I know, it's a bar too, but it at least has food with reasonable prices.

It's been a long day and night, so we stumble in around 10:30PM? We are hungry and tired, so patient was low. Service was a slow but the waitress was nice.

I had some fish tacos, don't remember what kind of fish, but it had avacados on top. The food didn't stand out too much to me, but I didn't really care. I was very tired and needed to go back to the hotel, so I ate as much and as fast as I could. And we were out of there by 11:30.

I didn't get any drinks since I was DD, but I'm sure the drinks were pretty good. Not my first choice to eat around this area. 

They must have renovated or something, because this place seemed clean to me and the washroom looks different from the pictures posted on yelp."}
{"text":"Awesome restaurant- friendly and helpful staff, cool atmosphere, GIANT portions for cheap, and the best cocktails!! 
We ordered nachos and tacos and they were both delicious, we'll be back!"}
{"text":"People were nice but poor service. I've been here twice and they've gotten my order wrong both times. Glasses were always empty as well. I probably won't be back."}
{"text":"The boy and I wandered St. Catherine's street for a while trying to figure out where to eat dinner and not being able to make a decision. We sort of stumbled upon C&P's by accident and were tempted by the $1 taco deal for that evening. We both really enjoy Mexican food, and were pretty hungry by then so we thought, \"why not give it a try?\".

We were disappointed to learn (once in and seated) that the $1 taco deal was actually for the upstairs part of the restaurant, which we thought was really strange and annoying. However, the waiter said they also had 1/2 price fajitas that night as well so we decided to stick to where we were and give that a try as it was still a good deal.

We got tortilla chips and salsa to munch on - both were pretty good, though nothing special. I personally prefer chunky salsa and this one was a little watery. A good pre-dinner snack though. The boy and I shared a large glass of sangria, which was delicious (though that could have just been the sangria talking).

The fajita fixings came to each of us on a neat platter with built in \"holes\" for each little container of toppings, which were numerous - salsa, guac, sour cream, refried beans - plus the ubiquitous hot tray of sauteed veggies and meat in the middle. We were both impressed with the portions - they brought us 12 tortillas, and I had plenty of toppings to make 5 total fajitas with lots left over at the end. However, I would have been fine with 3 or 4 because after 5 I was so stuffed I couldn't move! Everything tasted great, though, especially my chicken (I also tried some of the boys' lamb and it was very tasty too). For like $8 or $9 bucks for each order, I felt that we got a ton of food for the money. 

The service was good - not great, but normal. Our server was nice and fast and the place was crowded when we got there around 7:30 or 8pm on a Sunday evening so it seems popular. All in all, not an awesome experience, but not bad."}
{"text":"The food is pretty average and I've had Mexican people tell me that it does not represent their cuisine at all.  The last time I ate here I got sick off the tacos so needless to say I'm quite turned off by it."}
{"text":"I've been here a handful of times, food is nothing special but when I'm in the mood for some mexican, this location is always convenient and prices are good.
However in the past year, they have increased their prices without making actual menu changes.
I typically get soft tacos or enchiladas. If it's stuffed with minced beef, it's tasty, but the steak strips are chewy and tough. Their rice is dry, not seasoned well. Refried beans are hit or miss. One time I got refried beans that had such a stinky melted cheese on top, I wasn't sure if they changed types or the cheese had gone bad. The dressing used on their little side of salad is quite yummy.

I haven't tried their margaritas, but their sangria is very good.

Service has always been very fast. It's not a fancy place, food isn't that great but depending on what you order, it's a good uncomplicated meal."}
{"text":"While exploring Montreal we met an awesome server who worked here and also another bar that we visited. He told us to come in when he worked next and needless to say we don't regret it! The tacos were excellent and the margaritas were needless to say very tasty. The decor is recently redone and has a very cool chic Mexican restaurant feel to it. Would definitely recommend for the great service and experience"}
{"text":"Sunday Promo Menu $1 taco requires 3 orders minimum along with drink ($2 cheapest is coffee/tea) - $5 min"}
{"text":"Restaurant ? What restaurant? This place is a dump it's disgusting ,We lived in Los Angeles for 7 years you guys can be sure that we know Mexican food because out of Mexico Los Angeles has the best Mexican food . Absolutely  nothing is good at  this so called disgusting restaurant. We ordered Guacamole and nacho chips omg chips were swimming in salt plus so hard probably made several hours ago , guacamole was so loose and the colour was pale green who know how many hours before it was made ( or maybe its ready made shit ) we also ordered Quesedillias they use the cheapest quality processed cheese and no garnishing in the plate, they throw it in front you like a dog food  it's sooooo tasteless plus they give you this so called red sauce it tastes like a Marinara sauce from a Italian restaurant . Now let's talk about the toilets :))) floors are broken , soap dispenser broken and its on top of the sink leaking everywhere ,pee on the floors mirrors cracked smells so bad ,I never seen a dirty bathroom like this , if you use the toilet here you should consider yourself lucky if you don't get some kind of STD .i am never  ever going back here plus I will put this place down to everyone , and wherever I goI will badmouth  this so called shit hole restaurant.  Finally I want to tell everyone that this is not s Mexican restaurant,  food they give you has nothing to do with Mexican food and all the ingredients they use is the cheapest cheapest. Cheapest quality money can buy  .including the tortilla yeakkkks
SHAME, SHAME , SHAME"}
{"text":"Vraiment rien de particulier à dire sur la nourriture servie dans ce restaurant. J'ai pris un burritos au buf. Bien que j'ai l'habitude des restos mexicains façon \"chaîne\", la viande était vraiment pas terrible, la petite soupe terriblement épicée, ce qui gâchait tous les autres goûts. L'ambiance est sympa ceci dit. Mais il ne faut pas y aller pour l'expérience culinaire..."}
{"text":"Absolutely delicious food. Couldn't ask for better Mexican food. The service was excellent and the food was absolutely delicious. Love the atmosphere."}
{"text":"What can I say? I've been going to Carlos and Pepe's since they were a little hole in the wall on Stanley street! I went today and much to my surprise, the renovations are super stylish, elegant, cosy and rustic. I was upstairs which was quiet and spacious. The service was impeccable, our waiter was super friendly, helpful and knowledgable.

I was there during happy hour so I ordered a mango daiquiri - served with a lime wedge and fresh mango slices. My meal was the enchiladas (it's called the Mexican flag I believe) - shredded marinated beef, shredded chicken and spinach and coriander with a white, red and green sauce. Super tasty! I had a substitute of salad for the rice - good portions abs everything was piping hot and super tasty. 

Hubby had chicken breast soft shell tacos in hard shell tacos with rice - all the ingredients were plentiful, super fresh and delicious. 

Prices were also very reasonable. 

The new look is more rustic/Tex Mex and the menu is pretty detailed and extensive along with the great variety of tequila and mescal. All in all, what an improvement on something that was already close to perfect. Weekly specials every day - great for groups or a date. Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"I unfortunately did not enjoy my experience here. The concierge at our restaurant recommended it as a good option for Mexican food, but I was not impressed.

The strawberry margarita was ok, but I asked for no salt, and yet chunks of sea salt kept working their way up my straw into my mouth.

Their salsa was unpleasantly sweet-ish, the guacamole had little flavor, and although the chicken and shrimp fajitas my boyfriend and I shared were ok, the portion size was very stingy. There were only three shrimp included in the dish, and the peppers/onions to chicken ratio was probably 5 to 1. Service was slow and a little uninspired. My bf lasted about 40 minutes before he got hangry and had to ask where our main dish was. 

 I'm not sure If I've been spoiled by the amazing, authentic Mexican restaurants at home, or if I'm just being picky, but whatever the case, I would not recommend."}
{"text":"Service was great, attentive and friendly. Chorizo queso  was fantastic, along with the quesadilla. One of the best meals I had while in downtown Montreal"}
{"text":"BLEH! I was not expecting to have real authentic mexican food, but this was just bad. The food had no seasoning or taste whatsoever and was missing a lot of key ingredients. Also the service was terrible! Took a long time to take our orders, we had our empty plates in front of us for about half an hour and we had to ask ourselves for the cheque. I will not be returning!!"}
{"text":"Food is average, you have cheap options. It's not authentic Mexican food. 

Chips and salsa are not offered, it will cost you $1.

Service was really slow, about 40 min to be served.

Toilets are a mess. 

Overall I won't be back, it's like 3 amigos with more drink options but slower."}
{"text":"I don't know why so many people rated this place so highly, but if I could give a quarter star, I would.  The food really really sucks. The salsa tastes like tomato paste, and Pace Picante sauce would be fantastic in comparison.  And that's just the salsa.  The awfulness continues with their enchiladas and so forth.  Sorry, it was just that terrible, I really don't want to talk about it any more. 

Just don't ever go here, or think about going here. Its really that terrible."}
{"text":"Amazing!  My daughter and I were at the Eaton Centre and asked the staff for a nice authentic type place to go for dinner.  They suggested here.  The one girl said it is a little place ...hole in a wall but very good!  Well, let me say , this place is anything but a hole in the wall.  This night was their grand opening for their newly renovated space and it is so cool.  The atmosphere trendy and cool....the best Mexican food I have ever had.  
The portions were plenty, the presentation was perfect.  The service was top notch.  My daughter who hates guacamole anywhere...ordered seconds.  We also had the Mexican Ice Cream (which I have only liked at one place in Toronto 20 years ago...and this dessert surpassed that one 100 fold.  Check out the libations....what a menu!  It must be 1 foot by 2 feet and has all sorts of standard and not standard drinks.  I could go on....but will say this is a must stop for any local or traveller to Montreal!  Was the perfect way to close our shopping day!  Tres bien et merci pour un bon super!  Best wishes and success to you."}
{"text":"This was a great little spot in Montreal. I had been traveling for over a week and was really craving familiar Spanish food. The tortilla soup was delicious and the main meals are good portions."}
{"text":"My worst experience ever.
We went there last week before the cinema to eat and drink. We asked in advance how long we have to wait for dinner. The guy said 20-25. So we went upstairs where the music was as loud we didn't hear each other, we switched the table. We we waiting for 10 minutes for somebody to ask what we would like to drink. We ordered the drink and food also. After 15 minutes all everybody around us already got their drinks... 
I went to the guy (because they didn't even realize what happened) and asked when we gonna get our drink and food?!? 
Ha asked me \"What drink?\"
I told to him the drinks... He was watching me totally confused... He said he is gonna check it...
5 more minutes and the guy came to the table and said \"sorry we don't have your orders\"...
That time we've been in the place more than 30 minutes without any drink, the air on the upstairs was warm and humid, we were swatting...
So we said ok let's do again the orders, but for sure we asked could they serve the food in 25 minutes, because we had the tickets for a movie in the cinema.
The guy was laughing and said \"minimum 45 minutes - 1 hour\".
We said
In this case we have to go, we don't have time.
He said ok, sorry, bye and left.
We were standing next to the table and realized this place just focusing to the money not for the people...
Definitely I'm not going back!!!!!"}
{"text":"If you are really craving for Mexican food, and you are hungry and there is nowhere nearby you can take a seat here.

+ fast service
- expensive, not tasty."}
{"text":"OMG the fajitas were gross and the salsa was sweet. They defiantly need to revamp their menu or fire the chef because this has nothing comparable to tex-mex. Please go spend you money else where you will be very disappointed. Trust e I am doing you a favor you can by me a beer later."}
{"text":"The food was bland.  The chips came from a bag.  It was far too expensive for the quality of food they serve.  The service was decent though if that counts for anything."}
{"text":"The one-star is partly my fault. My first mistake was agreeing with my husband to eat at this place when we live in CA, home of the best Mexican food outside of Mexico. My second mistake was not checking Yelp before deciding. Trust me folks, I paid for my sins. We were seated immediately, and ordered drinks and were given chips and salsa (which was sweet and kinda weird), so things started off well. After ordering our food, our waitress came back 3x to ask clarifying questions about our order. This was a little perplexing since we ordered run of the mill items: steak fajitas, nachos, kids cheese quesadilla and kids chicken quesadilla - no substitutions on anything. Anyways,  after 30 mins of waiting for our food with no update from our waitress, I inquired and she said she'd go check. Did it not occur to her to do this already?? The restaurant wasn't busy btw. She comes back 5 mins later and said \"there was a problem in the kitchen, your food will be out in less than 5 mins\". 5 mins later another server comes over (possibly a manager), apologizes profusely, and says that the order never printed so the kitchen is working on it now. WTF. Another 5 mins later, the food finally comes out. It is mediocre at best and they didn't get the kids orders right. I will say that the manager was really apologetic and gave us 50% off the bill, which was a nice gesture for their error. I was so furious with our waitress for never checking on our order that I could barely muster any graciousness. This may be an isolated incident, but judging by the 2.5 stars, there clearly is more wrong than right at this establishment."}
{"text":"I ordered the chicken enchiladas. I've had way better enchiladas in other Mexican restaurants. It was pretty disappointing. My friend ordered the chicken fajitas, which looked better than the enchiladas. But she said it also wasn't the best she ever had. So in conclusion, I wouldn't come back. But if I had to, get the fajitas."}
