{"text":"Everytime I'm in town to visit, this is a MUST stop for lunch/ dinner. Everything here is fresh from the oysters, clams, shrimp, lobster, etc.  The pan roast and seafood chiapp. is my favorite. The chef packs the pasta with big pieces of shrimp, crab, and lobster. I don't know why they have low ratings, but you'll be surprised to taste such amazing dishes from this casino. Come try it out and you won't regret it!!"}
{"text":"Came here today for my birthday with family.  disappointed at first because there was only 1 waitress and a full bar and full dinning also.  But our waitress never forget to apologize and our food came just like how we want it to.  Like always ... superb food.  Thank you for doing the best you can."}
{"text":"Food was delicious. My girlfriend and I sat at the bar and ordered a dozen raw oysters and the pan roast. The oysters were really good, sweet and juicy despite it not being in season. It did look like most people were ordering grilled oysters, so we'll probably try that next time. The pan roast was rich and absolutely delicious, and our server/cook, Dennis, was even kind enough to give us extra rice because we were sharing.   Service was exceptional, had our waters/bread bowl refilled constantly and all of our needs satisfied almost immediately (though this may have also been because we were at the bar)."}
{"text":"I am so happy this place is here.. . The food is Amazing! And so fresh. Deserves way more than 5 stars.. Tues-Sun the service is top notch. Even my boyfriend doesn't eat seafood and he loves tne gumbo & black garlic caesar. Must try for locals as myself but tourists cant go wrong!"}
{"text":"Major disappointment.  The service was excrutiatingly slow in spite of the fact that the place was virtually empty.  The food was glop...the \"pan roasts\" were poorly cooked pieces of shrimp is a sauce that looked and tasted like it was Campbell's cream of tomato soup.  I will never return, and wouldn't recommend this place to anyone. It's worth noting that right next door in the casino is Austin's which I think is one of the most underrated steakhouses in town.  Sadly, the oyster bar is nothibng close in quality or service."}
{"text":"Wonderful..... Moved from Washington State and we love seafood very good and fresh. Been many times only ran into one bad server but talked to the floor manager right away and they handled it right away"}
{"text":"Don't be put off by the fact that it is in a casino. I end up in Henderson from time to time. The guys I work with laugh cuz I could eat here every day and night.   The jambalaya is off the hook. The Etouffee' is rockin'. I think the chef's name is Kevin. Same guy as 4 years ago. He puts together a delectable combination. I did not know you could select a spice level, I wish the server had told me. At least now YOU know."}
{"text":"Came here for oysters on the half shell. Sampled a couple different kinds, like the pico de gallo and wasabi/ creme freche. After eating half a dozen of each, decided they were not what we wanted and sent the remaining half dozen back for plain oysters. Amazingly, Matt, our server, gladly helped us out and hooked us up with a new plate of oysters, and we only paid for what we ate. Fantastic! Matt was wonderful and I highly recommend him. Great place for oysters on the half shell."}
{"text":"This Oyster Bar is fantastic! The staff, experience and the food were great. Thank you!"}
{"text":"The stove is broke nobody is here and our service has been terrible disappointing I usually love this place"}
{"text":"The food is great here.  I always get the Signature Pan Roast and my hubby always gets the peel and eat shrimp Maryland style and Alaskan crab legs without the boil.  Sometimes we have to wait to be seated but its all worth the wait."}
{"text":"Went here with my wife and they advertise closing at 11pm. I called the hotel to make sure that they don't have a time for last seating and I was told no. I arrived at 10pm and sat down at the bar and the chef told us they are closed. So as my wife and myself were walking out a waiter stopped us and told us it was okay for to take a seat. This was the highlight of our dinner.   We order the New England Clam chowder and  lobster bisque to start off our meal. They were both pretty bland. We also ordered a dozen oysters and they were actually really good and the price was reasonable. Our main course we had pan roast which wasn't a traditional pan roast that usually is a tomato base and a bit pricey. Honestly if you're on the strip this is the only place to go but if you're willing to drive to some of the other oyster bars around town definitely do so..."}
{"text":"Ok so me and the wife came in here for a dozen oysters, they were delish. Since the oysters were so good we tryed the New England clam chowder that was awesome to. I looked over and the lady next to use had A huge dish of seafood with a cream sauce at the bottom and convinced us to try it. It's called Pan Roast OMG so good. I'm from Florida and I know seafood this is good seafood!!! But I think what mAde it so fun and a all around good expierence was our server Trent. Ask for his section. He's was at the oyster bar area when we were there."}
{"text":"Worst service I ever had in Vegas. Waiter is rude and we waited more than half hour to even get the water. The steak we ordered was midium but had a well done steak which is disgusting! Will never come back. EVER!"}
{"text":"The five stars is for the quality of the raw oysters. This is what any oyster bar should be judged on. They were perfect raw oysters!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!The Shigoku were to die for, and the Kusshi were wonderful.  (I would have liked some raspberry/shallot mignonette to accompany them as well as the standard chili/horseradish sauce)  The rest I would rate at four stars.  Ly and Trent, our 'chef - servers' were great.  One hint: If you get the  Oysters Rockefeller (which were quite good though not spectacular, - at least there was no bacon, thank God !!!!)  ask them to put a little extra Pernod on them and to finish them in the \"salamander\" (They'll understand). Also ask them to use the speciality oysters for the Rockefeller instead of the Fanny Bay which are larger. In general with oysters, smaller is better.  The clam chowder was very good, but on the very salty side, three stars, but enjoyable.  I thought the grilled oysters were a waste, they just tasted like parmesan cheese with hot garlic butter.  Try the Sea Glass Sav Blanc for wine. Yes, it's the cheapest on the menu, but that's not the reason. It's just plain good with the oysters. We had 2+ bottles and could easily have had another if we had any more room for more oysters.  The Key Lime Pie is acceptable, not nearly as good as I make, but better than most restaurants' versions. I enjoyed theirs.  We didn't try any other food but I saw it being prepared and it looked good and creative. For example the bouillbaisse had not only saffron, as required by all recipes, but Pernod, as well. Very interesting!!  jpl779@sbcglobal.net"}
{"text":"We went to the Oyster bar to pick up the Salmon and rice dinner.  We paid for a side of broccoli.  When we got home and opened our containers, we noticed they served us some over cooked old broccoli.  The florets are yellow, my salmon is overcooked and burnt and they left out the tomatoes in the tomato and caper sauce.  When the main chef is their the quality of food is good but avoid the place like a plaque when she is not there."}
{"text":"6 oyster shooters with Patron Silver was perfect. The freshest oysters we've had so far in Las Vegas. Nice and plump with very little of an ocean taste. We sat at the bar and served by the most friendliest guy. It was a great atmostphere. We will consider coming back in the future. Usually we just go to Asian Buffet for all you can eat oysters but really it's a huge difference in quality."}
{"text":"Horrible horrible horrible service is extremely slow had to keep reminding the waitress of what I ordered they do not accept reservations it's first come first serve everyone is standing around like they don't know what they're doing I have to be honest with you I rather pay a little bit more for all-you-can-eat sushi and a noncasino environment....definitely two thumbs down!!!!"}
{"text":"I've never had an order that I wasn't satisfied with except for their Carne Asada special. It was so bad that my kid wouldn't even eat the fries. Lol  I'm giving this restaurant a 5-star despite of that because everything else about them (service, foods, ambiance, etc) keep me a satisfied, content, and loyal guest!"}
{"text":"The service at this place is amazingly friendly and attentive. Not to mention the Linguine with Clams is the best I've ever had. The pasta is always al dente! Plus, they pour wine generously by the glass. Prices are reasonable, and it is a perfect date spot before seeing a movie at the Suncoast Theaters."}
{"text":"Great casual seafood! Oysters and tuna were delicious! Got exactly what I was craving. Matt is one of the best servers I've ever encountered. AMAZING- service. Timed our dinner perfectly. Really made the dinner. Easy and affordable with great service."}
{"text":"Worst experience in Las Vegas so far. Frozen lobster tail smells bad and taste like paper and the pan roaster stinks for not fresh seafood. My girlfriend thought I farted when I talks with the smell of seafood. However the oyster is acceptable. Update: The manager came out and took off the price for undesired dishes, which is nice. Definitely try clam chowder tho, it's good."}
{"text":"I had a craving for King Crab Legs while in Vegas, and Yelp directed us to the Oyster Bar.  The crab legs were awesome!!  The were served spit so I didn't have to fight to get the meat out.  The asparagus was good.  I also ordered a mixed drink, and the pour was so generous that I asked for a little more soda because I'm kind of a wimp.  Our friend had the fish special of the day, and said it was very good.  I would definitely go back for the crab legs!  There were also TVs so that we could keep an eye on the Thursday Night Football game."}
{"text":"First time ever  being here... Food was amazing! Though it's neat to watch the experience of them making your food in front of you, something's may ruin your appetite... I saw a few cross contamination things going on, no use of gloves , touching non food items with your hands then back on the lettuce while prepping a salad, and the worst was we sat in front of the soup containers and one of the waitresses dished out soup and a few minutes later came back and poured it back into the large soup container ! Knowing that I will never try or eat the soup here! That fact that it was done is bad enough but to do it in front of guest with no shame is just disgusting!"}
{"text":"My family has been coming here for years. It's one of favorite places. My grandma and I split crab legs, my dad enjoys the linguini, and my mom gets shrimp. Use to be great service, there was always at least 2 servers working and my grandma loved them (which she's a 84 year old who can't hear well and could careless for people so it's says a lot they had a great relationship. Obviously people move on with jobs but now it's been three times we've been there this summer that only one new (different every time) server is working and two busers who don't do anything besides set the tables. The place gets busy and the server can't keep up. That first time this summer a customer started yelling about how long it was taking and even went up to the bar to get his own food that was waiting on the counter. This time tonight the lady was taking a long time to bring the check and my grandma just gave her the card. When she brought the card back with the receipt we noticed she had entered two extra items ($20 value) so we had to wait for a manager to come. A manager came and claimed he was the only manager on site but didn't know how to fix it because it wasn't his department (he said he was the food and beverage manager tho???) I don't know though, the foods still good. Just a management issue."}
{"text":"The rolls were soggy and drinks overpriced... it ruined the crappy crab cocktail I ordered.  The steamed clams were like RUBBER, galvanized for riding in the desert with hot asphalt roads.  I found no value, nor food quality."}
{"text":"Great place it is as good as the oyster bar in palace station with better prices !!!!! Thanks"}
{"text":"Incredibly nice staff. My husband and I have been here numerous times and always have great service. Tonight however, we were disappointed. We waited over an hour for our entrées while sitting at the bar and had to leave disappointed. I understand that restaurants get busy but when people are seated next to you, twenty minutes AFTER you've already been sitting there and they get their food BEFORE us, something went wrong. Unfortunately, my husband says we won't be returning even though I love the Oyster Bar. :("}
{"text":"The food was good, but they need to clean the place better; suggestion a cap of bleach in the cleaning water will stop the flies from sitting on the tables, oh and wipe the menus. Yes we will give the Oyster Bar a second chance."}
{"text":"Grotesque place to eat. I cannot believe they meet the health department standards.  Ordered take out, $200 worth of 3 lobsters, a LB of crab legs, 1 shrimp cocktail, two bowls of clam chowder, and 2 dozen oysters with LIVE, wiggling, squiggling, WORMS!  We dove into our meal, ate a dozen oysters prior to noticing the meal was infested with possible parasites!  I'm familiar with seafood purchasing policies and procedures. The meals we consumed were obviously not inspected nor cleaned prior to serving. We noticed one very long worm swimming in the oyster juices of the container, then half a moment later, saw countless more!  We all immediately ran to the bathrooms and sinks in the household and feared what we had ingested. We called the manager on duty right away, without even seeing the food, he apologized and offered to comp the meal. He was pleasant, not his fault (solely), I know this type of thing isn't done on purpose- but what gives?  Food safety (and cleanliness) should come 1st!  This place will never, ever receive my business or any friend of mine's business due to lack of concern from the executive chef and his staff. Should anyone want to see the video footage I have of the incident, I have it on my iPhone!  We have also saved and frozen one of the containers. Do NOT eat here!!!"}
{"text":"Its a must have every time I go to vegas.  Beer boiled shrimp,  grilled oysters, raw oysters and Bloody Mary oyster shooters are all on my must order list.  If you feel like steak, it great there too!"}
{"text":"This place is a must do while in Vegas. 4 of us were walking pass and said Why Not?   We were so impressed and will be sure to come back here every time we are in Vegas. Moon was our waiter...he took our order's and didn't write anything down. Yet he got everything right and yet went above and beyond. They have 4 different bloody marys on the menu...we told Moon we wanted a basic mary....non spicy...He gave  us what we wanted....He left his station to please our palates with what we asked for.  The food was awesome...we had raw oysters....grilled oysters...oysters casino...oysters rockafeller  for our apps. Between the 4 of us we had the scallops...king crab...the risotto...lobster...clam chowder...prawns and sea bass. All the food we had was to die for. So tasty. This place is a must do while in Vegas."}
{"text":"This isn't by any means a high-end seafood experience, but it's in the Harrah's so I wasn't going into it with high expectations anyway.  The seat-yourself aspect of going into the place was a little confusing and the service furthered that confusion. After a good while of sitting at the high tables facing the casino, one server brought in the bread and said she'd take our order but then turned around and left saying there was a \"shift change.\" Once we got the right server sometime later, we ordered the Oysters Rockafeller, Jumbo Fried Oysters, Seafood Risotto, and the Lobster Ravioli as an appetizer.   Everything came out at the same time, so whatev on the appetizer. The ravioli was reportedly good. The oysters were my order; the fried oysters were better than the Rockafeller, but was still a pretty simplistic dish. It was only good in the way that anything fried is good. The Rockafeller dish was alright; I've had better at home in Washington for less. They were a little gritty.. I definitely got my calcium dose for the day in shell bits. I recommend putting on the Tapatio hot sauce that was conveniently on the table for those.   The seafood risotto was alright but my fiancé wasn't thrilled about having to de-shell every mussel, every shrimp and lobster tail for that dish.  The food quality gives this review it's 3 stars; only to be topped by real coastal restaurants with fresh seafood coming in daily. The service was lackluster but not the worst I've seen in Vegas. Situated right in the middle of the casino, it offers a great view of the usual tenants at Harrah's: hardened casino grandma's hovering over the slot machines."}
{"text":"We had read the reviews and decided to try The Oyster Bar for dinner one night.  So glad we did!!  This little seafood jewel is tucked away in a small section of Harrah's Casino.  We sat at the bar and watched them shuck the oysters and prepare our meals!  My husband and I both had \"kettle\" cooked items - he had the seafood bouillabaisse and I had the seafood risotto.  Both were excellent choices.  The bouillabaisse was like a seafood \"treasure hunt\" - it had a nice sized lobster tail, huge shrimp, mussels and fresh fish in a wonderful stock - it seemed as if you could put your spoon in the bowl and bring up something new each time!!  The risotto was cooked to perfection as we watched and tasted amazing.  Again, an assortment of fresh seafood throughout the entire bowl.  Our server, Trent, was also the cook and he was highly entertaining and extremely attentive.  Very fresh oysters and assorted seafood served in a surprising, casual atmosphere made this one of our new LV favorites!!"}
{"text":"so sorry I didn't consult Yelp first.  all reviews are spot on - including the beer listed on the menu that isn't available....  Service was pleasant I guess but the food just sucked.  Perhaps if you go for the all you can eat snow crab legs you'll be happy but I don't recommend the other stuff.  Even the rice wasn't cooked properly."}
{"text":"Decent food, but pricey. I had the 8oz lobster tail, which was pretty good. However, our server was hardly around at all the whole time we were there. They definitely could work on the cleanliness of this place as well. If I was in a pinch, I would go here again, but it would definitely not be my first choice for seafood."}
{"text":"Dennis provided us with the most amazing service, made us feel extra special, felt like our own private cook. He knows his menu and prepared exactly what we wanted seasoned and cooked to perfection."}
{"text":"5 stars because of the attentive service by Carlos on 1/19/17. I ordered a dozen Pacific Plump oysters and began feeling a reaction shortly after 4 oysters. Carlos was able to get me a cold towel right away as I was panicking, unsure of what I was feeling as I've never had ANY negative reaction to oysters. Turns out my cough pill prescription with the oysters did not sit well. Aside from my panicking...the oysters were bomb and bummed I couldn't eat the rest."}
{"text":"Not sure how to describe my dining experience, the food was underwhelming  to be generous. I was expecting more, the service was adequate. It was nothing to write home about.  One member of our party received his order at least twenty minutes after everyone else. To make situation worse, his order was not prepared well.  I doubt I will visit this establishment again, I should have read these reviews prior to attending."}
{"text":"Totally, totally coming back! Fresh, cheap (for Vegas), and to the point. Sit at the bar for quick service. Order the oysters. Seriously, they are fresh and delicious. $20 for a dozen. Guaranteed fresh, what more can you ask for?   The Seafood Risotto was $26, and really made for sharing. There's tons of seafood in it... Huge shrimp, lobster, clams, and scallops - all cooked to perfection. It was awesome. Not at all chewy and bland, like I expected, given the location and price. I was so impressed.  The clams in broth were good as well, but when I come back... it's all about the oysters and seafood risotto. Harrah's... who knew?"}
{"text":"Every two to three months we come to Vegas, the Oyster Bar at Harrahs is on our must do list every single time! The oyster selection is top notch and always so fresh! The bartender has fantastic drinks that will keep you feeling great, try the Tsunami it's fantastic ( my wife loves it) the Tiger prawn sauté and the O.B. Pan roast and also must try's you will not be disappointed, if I could give 6 stars I would!"}
{"text":"This is our go to place. The close time says 10:30 but is actually 10pm. Keep in mind or you will have an angry chef on your hands! Food is amazing though!"}
{"text":"The environment was great, hip, and fun. Our waiter/chef was awesome he served up some hella good margarita that lasted me the whole night to be drunk! Well worth it! The food was amazing! My sister and husband had oysters they said it was really good. I had the risotto rice rice seafood dish. It's similar to the Spanish Paella dish. It has a curry cream rich elegant tang to it. The clams, mussels, lobsters, and king prawn where a great size and I still had some left over. It's a great sit down joint to enjoy the hustle and bustle of Harrah's without being secluded from the action. Also our waiter/chef reminded me of Carlos Mencia with his Spanish accent; great personality and charming charisma! He brought the food and environment alive! My sister had the blackened fish; the flavors mingled and tinged together. It was unique flavorful that was worth eating slow!"}
{"text":"This place has improved over the past year. I am told they have a new Chef and that he has really spent time making the recipes better. I really enjoy the house pan roast!!!! Best ever!!!!! Ask for the Mexican Shrimp cocktail....it is not on their regular menu, but they have it available!!!"}
{"text":"Dining at the Oyster Bar at Sunset Station became a tradition for my wife and I whenever we are in Las Vegas. We always order the oysters, clam chowder, pan roast and bouillabaisse. So good !!! The bar is wraparound so you can see the chefs do  their magic and smell all the goodness. Can't wait to dine there again."}
{"text":"Oysters were awesome with several varieties to choose from. Wait time wasn't as long as the other oyster bars around vegas and price was decent for a restaurant inside a casino. Oyster shooter was good with several choices to choose from. Didn't care fir the Ahi Tuna salad."}
{"text":"10 minutes or so to seat... not bad... still it's only a Monday night... once seated, we waited, and waited...and waited...no water-no bread, no server... finally a 'waitress shows to take our drink orders and disappears for another 15 minutes...still, no water, bread etc.. finally some rolls arrive... still no drinks ( I don't mean mix a drink... I mean water and ice tea... the whole meal went this way... add to that, when we mentioned how long everything was taking, we got no apology, just a testy 'we only have one cook' answer -as if that explained the lack of service, that our salad was made and sat on the bar for 20 minutes until we asked for it... we have brought visitors here for dinners for over a decade and have experienced many changes in menu and staff, but this was the worst... we will not be.back..."}
{"text":"I was going to give 5 stars but we waited like 35 mins to get a table, but the seafood jambalaya it's crazy good, oysters are so fresh and not to mention the oyster shot are amazingly good!!!! It's worth the wait right, but because we have two little kids it's just hard to wait that long coz kids get bored so fast lol! It's kinda pricey but quality wise worth it"}
{"text":"Update to my previous review- Oyster bar is back! This location seems to have had a turnover in staff- but know they are running like a well oiled machine!  Food is better than ever! Staff is attentive and have always loved the vibe!   We hit this place about 2-3 times a month and highly recommend !"}
{"text":"We've been here before and they never disappoint. We make sure to sit at the counter and always have a great time. This time we had grilled oysters, they were awesome. The seared tuna salad was superb (as well as being a large portion of very fresh ahi). The clams were done in a wonderful sauce. Toss in 2 great drinks and we're very happy with this place. One of the very few reasons to go to Harrah's anymore."}
{"text":"The Suncoast's Oyster Bar serves pre-shucked oysters. (They remove the blue plastic bands around each one before serving them on the half shell.)  I had two dozen oysters and was satisfied with the price I paid.  For $14.99 per dozen, I didn't expect greatness, and I got exactly what I expected.  They oysters were large and plump, but had none of the liquor (probably due to them being pre-shucked).  They don't have different kinds of oysters, like I would expect an oyster bar would.  I guess this is a good place to go if you are craving oysters and want a place that's quick and cheap.  It's fun to watch most of the dishes being prepared right in front of you.  The bouillabaisse could have had a stronger flavor, but it's tasty nonetheless.  If you go to Senor Miguel's next door, you can order from the Oyster Bar menu, too."}
{"text":"The blackened shrimp and pan roast was outstanding, as was the service by Jacqueline. Sit at the counter and enjoy watching the kitchen prepare your meal. If you've never had pan roast, you're in for a treat.   We will make this a staple of our Las Vegas visits."}
{"text":"This place is amazing. The new england clam chowder was fresh and chock full of clams. Oysters are fresh and clean. Would definitely come back next time.   minus one star for service. Even though the place was slow, our orders and request took forever. There seemed to be only one host/waiter"}
{"text":"We stumbled upon this restaurant as we were picking up our Improv tickets early in the day, the menu looked good, and since we had to come back to the hotel for the show later, we figured it was worth a try!  My family is a bunch of seafood lovers, and we got our fill of seafood at the Oyster Bar!  We started off with the Lobster Bisque (so rich, and HUGE chunks of lobster), steamed clams in white wine broth (AMAZING) and some fresh oysters (SO FRESH!).  We also tried the crab legs, seafood risotto (swimming with seafood) and the scallops.  We loved everything, and felt that we really found a hidden gem in Vegas because you don't normally think of Harrah's as a dining mecca!  The prices were very reasonable compared to some of the high end dining options in Vegas...so I will be back next time I am in town!"}
{"text":"This place was great, we went with our close friends and had a blast.  The variety of oysters were great and the calamari wonderful.  Love the flatbread and wonderful bloody Mary's.  Will visit this place again when in Vegas!"}
{"text":"My husband and I visited Oyster Bar on our last trip to Vegas in late August/early September.  OMG - it was great!  There was a good variety of items to choose from on the menu besides the oysters, and I would recommend those as well.  We did not make reservations since we were having an early dinner and we manged to get in without any problems."}
{"text":"This place used to not be terrible a few years ago, not the case now.  Located in The aging Harrahs, the Oyster Bar staff seemed pretty scatter brained.  A host never seated us, so we bellied up to the bar.  It took about 10 minutes to get attention from staff, and another 5 for menus.  The food was subpar and took a long time.  I would not go back."}
{"text":"Took my wife here on a date.  It's a great place for it.  I had a dozen raw gulf oysters that were excellent and FRESH.  The gumbo was also great but it has a shload of slimey okra in it which I wasn't to keen on.  I like okra, just not that much in quantity in one sitting.  It was loads to eat, I couldn't finish the gumbo because I was so full.  My wife loved the shrimp as well.  I will happily return soon."}
{"text":"The food was great! The open kitchen is entertaining.   We had the cioppino, the combination pan roast and the little neck clams. The clams were kinda a bit too sandy for me but everything else was excellent.   Our cook/server Beau was perfect; friendly, accommodating, welcoming. Another cook seemed a little grumpy, but hey, maybe he was having a bad day.   Also, they have some great beers available; Abita being one of them."}
{"text":"I came here two days ago on accident. A friend of mine suggested I go to the Oyster Bar, but failed to mention that it was the one at the Palace Station hotel. I accidentally navigated myself here, but it was the best mistake I could've made. I ordered the pan roast because that was what my friend suggested to me, thinking it was at the other restaurant, so I did. They served it to me in a giant metal bowl that looked like half a mini torpedo. It was kinda cool. The pan roast comes with a variety of fresh, well cooked seafood that was absolutely delicious. It was served in this yellowish curry that stole the show. I could not stop eating and tasting it. I was tempted to take a dish  home with me, but at $31 I decided to save it for some gambling. Service was good. Although I did have to wait a whole after my meal for the waiter to come by and ask if I needed anything else, which I did. Overall good experience though. I would consider staying at Harrah's just so I can eat here. Plus it's open 24/7. Awesome!"}
{"text":"Great friendly staff! Especially the server Moon, the dude from Korea!  The food is so fricken' salty though my god I'm dying from salty mouth as a write this!!   I still have a full table of salty food to eat and  I'm not excited to eat it!  The oyster shooters are good though!"}
{"text":"delicious food, excellent service definitely the best sea food place in vegas strip 10 out of 10 would recomend! thanks chef mundo"}
{"text":"Terrible experience! Went here tonight for dinner. Waited 15 minutes before the waiter came by, despite asking the hostess and other wait staff for a server to take our order. We ordered a combination of appetizers and entrees to share.   After ordering, the server didn't come back for 10 to 15 minutes until the food came. He didn't bring plates with the food and was annoyed when we asked for plates. He first brought very small bread plates. We then asked for larger plates because we wanted to share what we ordered. When the wait staff brought us full size plates, there was a pubic hair on the plates. We let the manager know and left without eating.   After this disappointing experience, we went to Joe's Seafood at Caesar's Forum shops and had a great meal."}
{"text":"This place is phenomenal!!!  It was so good that we had dinner here twice in a row.  We had their oysters and bouillabaisse.  Both were great!  The oysters were very fresh and the bouillabaisse (seafood soup) was very chunky and flavorful.  And on top of it all, it was very reasonably priced.  For all you vegas visitors, come check this place out!"}
{"text":"Although the food was ok, the service was awful. Ordered the oysters and crab cakes which were good, and then the Cajun pasta. The pasta was not in any way Cajun and a very small portion. Will not be returning here!"}
{"text":"Was absolutely delicious!!  We are locals and have seen this place here but never stopped to try and so glad we did.  We had drinks and a bunch of different entrees.  We started with ousters that were great.  Moved on to the clams and the sauce they came in was so yummy, try not to fill up on the bread!  And finished with the snow crab boil which was just a great as everything else.  Thank you for a great night!!"}
{"text":"First of all, we are not from the area so we didn't know how far it was from the strip.  We came from the Red Canyon area so it was a long drive for us. We heard of the place from purchasing a Groupon. The Texas Station was packed because we had a hard time finding parking but the restaurant itself was pretty slow... that was a sign. We ordered two cocktails that were decent and strong.  And we ordered a dozen oysters and decided to share the gumbo.  The oysters were okay.  I was a little worried because I wasn't sure how often they get new inventory because they were not busy on a Friday night.  Where we are from, Friday nights are big seafood nights.  Well, the oysters were ice cold so we decided to go for them and they were not that bad compared to the gumbo.  To be honest, the gumbo looked like dog food with two scoops of rice on top.  The soup was so dark you could not even see the seafood or taste the seafood.  I think I did find a scrap piece of lobster and it was so mushy.  After a bite, I couldn't eat anymore of it.  Even the bread and butter tasted old.  Not a good choice for dinner.  The service was good but the food was horrible.  In the middle of the night, I did wakeup to vomit.  I'm not sure if it was the food or the drinks.  All we had wasone drink each so we were not intoxicated or anything. Overall, it was not a good experience."}
{"text":"Delicious pan roast made by Kevin!  Russ was a great chef/server as well.  The entire staff worked so well together during a but time. They seemed to enjoy their jobs and that was refreshing to see. Thanks to everyone there for a great meal!"}
{"text":"We will definitely be back. I thought the waiter was really chill and friendly. He really wanted us to try these japanese oysters... forgot the name but they were so good we ordered an extra half dozen on top of the dozen we devoured. They were small, but melted in your mouth.   The bread was super tasty, and I bet would've been good with the clam chowder. We also got the calamari, yummy! I loved the simple presentation of the whole place. So laid back, and I loved hearing the slot machines ringing as I ate.   I think our total came out to be around 100, which was a bit of a shock. But as I mentioned in the beginning... can't wait to go back and try more delicious oysters!"}
{"text":"AWESOMENESS!!!  This was our first time to stay at Harrah's Hotel and we decided to try this place..  The food were great, service is excellent.  We didn't have to wait too long and the servers are really friendly.  We tried the fried calamari, NY clam chowder, and steak.  Our last day, we ordered the Seafood Risotto, it was so onooooo!!!!  We go to Vegas at least four times a year and I can honestly say we will definitely visit this place again.  Mahalo to Trent, great service."}
{"text":"The service, food, and scene were excellent. I will return, fresh seafood in the middle of nowhere, WOW!!!"}
{"text":"I was fortunate enough to enjoy a great meal last week at the Oyster Bar. It was the highlight of my stay in Vegas.  The server Trent was great and the oysters were fantastic.  I also ordered the surf and turf and it was fabulous and a great value.  I would definitely go back again.  If you are near or staying at Harrahs hit up the Oyster Bar, you will not be disappointed!"}
{"text":"Great seafood place. My parents and I left very satisfied. We got the seafood platter, seafood risotto, grilled lobster tail, and ahi tuna salad. The food was great and the waiter was really nice."}
{"text":"House Pan Roast was delicious.   Only bad thing is when we were leaving we overheard a couple telling the hostess  That they were sick & coming out both ends nonstop.  Eeek.  So far so good !!"}
{"text":"New england chowder was good.  Good stock gave lots of clam flavor.  But downhill from there.  Seemed like old buffet seafood and very bland.   Really bad, especially for price.  Even clib soda a 4 a piece was a bit much also.  I will stick with the sunset station oyster bar. Much better"}
{"text":"The nastiest food that I've ever tasted. Everything was horrible. The cooks were dirty and the food was nasty. The only good thing out of the place was the waiter. I ordered a dozen of oysters and I see the guy cutting them up and throwing them in the trash and I'm like wtf. So after he did this with, and I'm not exaggerating, 20+ oysters the waiter brings me the plate with my dozen oyster.  They looked horrible. They were super fat and the color was different than regular oysters. I tried one and I spit it out. The waiter saw me and asked me if everything was ok. I told him that they were nasty and that I would just pay my bill and leave. He told me not to pay, and that it was ok. I tipped the guy $20 and I left. Never going back to that place again. Don't go there. The place, cooks and food are nasty."}
{"text":"Maryland Crab Cakes are awesome.  Peel'n eat shrimp great too.  Equally if not more impressive is that I walked by a mile long buffet restaurant line to sit down without a wait at the Oyster Bar and get served an awesome meal faster than I did in the McDonald's drive thru on my drive back home from the Charlotte Airport!  Oh yeah, I felt like my old man.  I liked it so much I ate their Wed., Thurs., and Friday night!  One night I was actually singing karaoke at the Piano Bar and managed to eat dinner between songs, LOL!   Tell Trent (black guy, bartender/server that Cowboy Jim from South Carolina says hello)!  Great service, great food!"}
{"text":"Really good food that we came back for a 2nd meal on the same day.  The rib eye steak (medium rare) was perfect, too!"}
{"text":"The pan roast here is just as good as the one at Palace Station. There are no lines and the service is pretty quick. Sometimes we are the only table eating. Would definitely continue to eat here."}
{"text":"They always serve the absolute best new england clam chowder i've ever had.  It's fantastic.  I stay at Rio but always journey to the strip just to have a bowl of this stuff."}
{"text":"So if you're in love with Pan Roast as much as my friends and I are, but absolutely HATE that 2 hr wait at Palace Station, we got directed to go to Texas Station to their Oyster Bar. (Really security told us to go here because kids aren't allowed at the Palace Stations Oyster Bar. Not sure why you gotta be 21 to eat here but whatever. This place is such a hidden gem.) It's so far off the strip that I don't think people come here. There is absolutely wait and the food is exactly the same. There is more seating too. Forget waiting for Pan Roast ever!!"}
{"text":"Amazing clam chowder & their grilled oysters are the best! I would highly recommend this place to Everyone."}
{"text":"Amazing Gumbo Level 6!!!!! and i do not like gumbo. My friend made me try and i will never regret it, lol. I went back again just before leaving vegas. #Yummmy #Must Try!!!!"}
{"text":"We were pleasantly surprised to have such a wonderful and delicious meal. The service was incredible and the ambience was great. The Cioppino was delicious and we have enough for a second meal. The lump crab cocktail and New England clam chowder I would get again. We can't wait to go back and this time try the pan  roast and the shrimp cocktail."}
{"text":"Not fancy and not overly clean (the menus are gross), but it keeps me coming back year after year.   The GF and I are creatures of habit and always get the same items: Oysters Rockefeller, bacon wrapped scallops, shrimp scampi and steamed clams in white wine sauce. All are very good, especially considering Las Vegas isn't really a seafood Mecca being that its in the middle of the desert.   I can't forget to mention the oyster shooters. I'd suggest manning-up and taking one or two. It'll help numb the guilty feeling you have from blowing all that money on the tables."}
{"text":"Good seafood at a reasonable price. Try the cioppino with fresh crab legs and clams in the shell along with their fish and shrimp buddies swimming happily in a zesty tomato sauce.  Sit at the counter and get the full treatment and watch the chef prepare your dinner.  Solid wine selection with a good savignon blanc - nice and cold to help deal with the 115 degree temps outside."}
{"text":"So had a comp for the casino and decided to try the Oyster Bar. I originally went a month ago and wasn't going to do a review, but ended up going to the buffet and the cafe since then and they are all horrible. I had the surf and turf and it was the worst ever. My friend had the seafood gumbo and it didn't even look good. The steak was seasoned bad and the shrimp had a funny taste to it. The gumbo looked nothing like I have ever seen before or even tasted. One good thing I can say is the server was very polite."}
{"text":"I went to the oyster bar at the Texas Station on new years day with 2 of my friends. 2 of us ordered the pan roast which consist of shrimp and crab. When I received my order it had no crab whatsoever In it. My friends did. I told the hostess about my order and she said she'd get me the manager. When the manager came to the table I told her about my ordeal that there was no crab In my bowl. She was so rude she put her nasty finger all in my bowl trying to point out the  flurry mites of supposed to be crab floating around. She kept asking me do I see the crab and I kept telling her NO I DONT. FINALLY  I just said forget it. I don't want it period. The ppl at that pictular oyster bar is so rude. It's like you get what I give you and that's it. No customer service skills at all. The customer next to me FINALLY got tired of all the back and forth I was having with the manager he decided to buy the bowl just to eliminate some of the drama that was going on. He himself did not see or taste any crab in his bowl but decided against sending it back. I will never go back to that pictular oyster bar again. Thank you for a great start of a new year Texas Station Oyster bar."}
{"text":"I have eaten here twice and both times I got an upset stomach (I am being very nice and putting this mildly) I don't know if they have bad hygeine or maybe they do not keep the food hot enough while holding or cooking things through properly, I just don't know or care.  Sorry Charlie, 3 times won't be no charm for me."}
{"text":"If you want oysters - just go across the street to Caesars' Bacchanal Buffet or any other buffet that serves oysters and eat there. The prices are pretty steep. a dozen oysters after tax/tip is about $30. Might as well go to a buffet and enjoy all the other seafood choices and pay a bit more.   Service was a bit slow as previous people have written. Nothing too horrible - but just noticed a  lack of attention as the meal went on and very slow to finish out the payment process.  For 2 people, ordered 2 drinks, a dozen oysters and the seafood boil pot. Came out close to $100 with tip. Totally not worth it... I know everything in vegas is expensive but to enjoy oysters, go else where."}
{"text":"Ordered oysters.  Did not vomit.  Did not die.  Service a tad slow.  Once again, did not die.  Success."}
{"text":"Small place and super cute. Oysters were delish, but we had to cancel dinner because after 40 minutes and no entrees we had a show to get to. We asked the waitress,  and she said it'd be another 10 minutes so we paid for the oysters and left.  Too bad, but I think the chefs were too busy watching basketball to cook. With a small (occupancy 40) restaurant, you should be able to put the food out more efficiently."}
{"text":"I honestly came to the Oyster Bar with some high expectations for some great food. It is sad that by the end of my visit I was very disappointed and regretted coming. Chef D was the one that cooked my food and honestly a lot of the food was very tasteless and bland. Nothing popped out to my taste buds it was all just a mush of flavor. I cannot see myself coming in again as this experience was just so bad."}
{"text":"Don't ever go here.   The oysters were slimy & didn't taste fresh, the mixed drinks were basically non alcoholic which I expect in the store front places but this is not a cheap restaurant.  To top it all off the waiter was a snob & not friendly at all, in Harrahs I wouldn't expect snobby waiters.   Save your money & go anywhere else."}
{"text":"my husband and i shared the pan roast with pasta on the side and it was delicious! The serving was already good for the both of us. we went here at around 5pm on a Monday and we were easily seated."}
{"text":"we went here for a lite dinner . Didn't want to kill the buzz we had so we were going to order the oysters on half shell but decide we wasn't going to pay 38.00 for them so we got the calamari and the sashimi it was the freshest sashimi I've ever had !!"}
{"text":"Order the Cajun Scallops! Sooo good.  The service here is top notch.  The severs are very attentive."}
{"text":"This place was amazing!  Came and ordered bbq'd oysters, the best lobster bisque I've ever had, I also ordered the pan roast and hubs got the ciopinno.  The broth of the pan roast had an unexpected sweet taste to it, but the hubs ciopinno was spicy and delicious!  Our friend also ordered the ciopinno and was disappointed that it came with no crab claws, so the server came and brought a side of claws for him and my husband at no additional charge!"}
{"text":"Need to update my rating of this place. Re visited in October 2016 and had the Miyagi oysters and they were delicious. Very plump and sweet. The service was great and had the ahi salad again and it was just as delicious! A great go to for good raw oysters during the colder months."}
{"text":"For me this is THE PLACE to go for delicious Manhattan Style clam chowder. Just the right amount of spice, meaty clams, and a great tomato base. The food is tasty every time I come here and the waiter with the arm band covering his tattoos is quite friendly. This last time I went the chef behind the bar seemed a bit distant, but hey you cant be Mister Rogers all the time right? High quality food found in an off strip casino is a rare find, enjoy it!"}
{"text":"Dined there last night for a late meal.  The service was friendly and the food was good.  I has the Clam chowder.  Like the fact that I can see the kitchen."}
{"text":"I cannot explain how delicious this place is. First of all THE BEST crab cakes! EVER!!! You have to get these. They are worth every penny! The fish and chips and calamari are excellent too. Everything is extremely fresh and so good.  Not only is the food amazing, but the service is equivalent. Our server was Moon, who was such a sweet, nice guy. He went above and beyond to get us everything we needed, and no need to ask for refills (which can sometimes be annoying); the minute our drinks were low, he was on top of it with another. If you eat here, please make sure to tip this guy good, he totally deserves it.  Last but not least, the restaurant itself is extremely cute and cozy, there is no other way to put it.  We've only eaten here once (we live in LA), but we will definitely be going there again next time we are in Vegas."}
{"text":"I think I would have a higher review for this place if it wasn't called OYSTER Bar.   As someone who has been looking for a good local oyster bar near my house, this was why I made my way to this spot.   I have enjoyed a few dishes here that are off the menu and its delicious!!The guys behind the bar look like they know what they are talking about , however my experience has been at the surrounding tables.  For a place called an Oyster Bar, all three times I have been there, the waitresses (multiple) look at me like I have three heads when I ask what KIND of oysters they have. And in all my trips there, they usually have two kinds only.  Oyster lovers know it isn't the size of an oyster which makes it good, it's the flavor, the brine, the feel on your pallet.   The oysters are bland here, whether it's east coast or west, north or south.. Doesn't matter. They don't taste like the sea and I walk away missing the oyster experience I was looking for.  Good list of wines that pair well with seafood, and like I said, some of the main meals are great.  I realize this is just a local place where the Sunset Station regulars like to get their drink on.. But WAH!! about the oysters.   Oyster fans be warned."}
{"text":"We went last night and try to stop in at least once a month. We usually order the same dish, (Mediterranean Salmon), which is EXCELLENT. It is located in the Sunset Station Casino and has a low key ambience to the room with running water features throughout the room. You can sit at the Oyster Bar and watch them cook the food or sit at the casual pub style tables. Nice place to hang out for awhile."}
{"text":"I got a recommendation to go to the Oyster Bar at Palace Station, but went here instead as the other would have at least an hour wait. Upon arrival, there was a sign saying to seat ourselves (not sure if this is the usual for them), which was no trouble for us as there was plenty of prepped tables available. We didn't have to flag down a server - we were addressed pretty quickly. The ambiance was dark and casual. My friend and I ordered a dozen oysters each, calamari, and the seafood risotto to share. All of our food came out relatively fast. Calamari was freshly fried, but other than that, nothing special there. The breading would have benefited from some salt and pepper. The oysters were fresh and the perfect size for me! The seafood risotto was delicious and they definitely didn't skimp on the seafood. The risotto was just a teeny bit undercooked, but really no complaints, still. At the end of the meal, we were able to get the check quickly. I was really satisfied with my meal and the service!"}
{"text":"One of my new favorite places to eat, have been here everyweek this month, my favorite is the shrimp linguine and clam clowers my husbands eats the boillebesse and some oysters he also loves it. Take cook right at the bar. The guys there are super friendly.  I forgot to mention has delicious the banana foster is, but i would ask for the ice cream on the side.  This will be place we frequently visit.."}
{"text":"I was expecting much better based on the Yelp reviews.  Service was slow and inattentive.  Food was just OK -- mahi mahi was swimming in a huge pond of too-heavy sauce.  About the only positives were that I was able to get a seat right away, and the portions are large."}
{"text":"Every time we come to Vegas, the Oyster Bar in Harrah casino is a go to spot. My favorite is the Oyster royale which are tiny oysters w/ green caviar on top. Super tasty and not fishy, caviar eggs pops in your mouth! Their jumbo shrimp cocktails are delicous, shrimps are big, sweet and cocktail sauce is on point! This place has a nice atmosphere, few tv's around to watch the games, good for a mid day snacker and drink."}
{"text":"In town for a conference and sat down for a quick lunch. I've eaten here many times, years before, so decided to grab my quick bite here. 10 minutes to get noticed.  5 minutes to get order taken of cup of soup and side salad. Both of which should be pre made. 15 minutes later, still no food!  I drank my coke and at a dinner roll. And left $2 and took off. There were a total of 5-6 patrons, 1 chef, 2 servers, and 1 manager in the whole place. So why was it so difficult to scoop a cup of soup and grab a plate of cold salad out of the fridge?  Disappointing."}
{"text":"Service was quick, friendly & accurate! Highly recommend this place! Shrimp po boy is worth the $10."}
{"text":"We went there yesterday at 3 pm and no one would wait on us.  We even changed to the bar and sat there for 20 mins.  No one would wait on us.  Very slow service and being ignored has caused us to look at other places.  Too many resturants to pick from."}
{"text":"Oyster Bar used to be my go-to place after exams and to eat with my friends, but the last time I went it wasn't as good as it used to be. The bread they give as appetizers used to be better with higher quality cheese bread and dinner rolls, now the cheese bread tastes stale and the dinner rolls something I grabbed at the grocery store.  The pan roast is still a good choice but it doesn't have the same rich flavor it used to. I'm not sure what changed or maybe it was a new cook on service that night, but I wasn't impressed as I used to be with their pan roast.  I used to rave able Oyster Bar to my friends all the time and I would bring my parents here every time they visited, but the flavor they produced the last time I went doesn't meet the hype anymore so I'm sad to say I won't be recommending this place as much. The Pan roast is good but not worth it at that price point. Either bring back the famous taste or make the price more reasonable for what you're delivering.  Our waitress took a long time to take our order and even though the restaurant was 2/3 packed, she didn't seem too busy. The venue is clean but you're seated next to an artificial waterfall and it will sprinkle on you. Not ideal but it's fun.  It's in the middle of Sunset Station, a place where I've made many memories watching movies and bowling with friends."}
{"text":"Food was good, service meh.  I had the O.B.'s Pan Roast and Oysters Rockefeller.  Both were great!  Make sure to add pasta because the sauce from the pan roast is really good with on the pasta!  A friend had the Bouillabaisse, which everybody thought tasted very bland.  I would not recommend getting this.  Another friend I believe had the classic shrimp scampi.  Once he got back to the hotel, it all came out the other end, undigested.  Same with another friend who had a bite of that same plate scampi.  Probably should avoid this dish as well.  The server seemed to be annoyed with us at the beginning for whatever reason.  At the time (around 5pm), there were only us (party of 8), and a party of 3, so the server's not swamped with work or anything.  We asked 3 times for a refill of bread (hungry drunk people), and it was never brought to us.  The server also made a mistake by ordering an extra pan roast, rather than the Bouillabaisse.  He allowed us to keep the pan roast though for free while he fixes his mistake.  All in all, -1 for annoyed server even though we weren't at all rude, and -1 for giving two of our party the runs."}
{"text":"Good food. Oysters and seafood are really really good. But the waiter is too busy to handle so many customers."}
{"text":"The most horrible customer service! My friend and I went to hang out and eat for a bit, but we ended up staying for a little longer than expected. We were there for about an hour and no one checked on us, not even once! They were not busy. At all! So, their horrible service is inexcusable! We literally took turns calling out for the waiter because he had such a bad attitude from the get go and we figured we'd \"share\" the burden of calling this man. There was only one man doing the cooking and the other was just hanging out the whole time. By the end of our dinner, there was a group of the waiters buddies hanging out and he was just standing there chatting it up with them while we waited for a refill that was never even offered ! we would have loved to stay and waste some more of our hard earned money but realized that, in the end, it was simply not worth it."}
{"text":"Service was excellent from the moment we sat ourselves to the moment we left.  Our server, Heidi, was pleasant and knowledgeable on both the menu and drinks.  She rattled off the entire beer menu to us without missing a beat..very impressive Ms. Heidi and kudos.  We ordered the clam chowder and fried calamari.  The calamari was an appetizer size, but wow this can feed four easily..it was served in a huge bowl and came nicely fried and very tender.  Came with an even mix of tentacles and rings.  Served with lemon, aioli and marinara sauce..delicious!  The clam chowder was very good as well.  Hubby and I came in just for a small bite to tide us over til dinner - wow..this ended up being our dinner!  I will be sure to visit this place every time I go to Vegas.  It's located right by the Harrah's buffet and Penazzi's main restaurant."}
{"text":"Excellent place for lunch!  We got a couple seats at the bar and we were quickly served.  We ordered a dozen oysters and got another dozen of our favorite of the two they had (Fannie Bay, I think - nice and briny).  The waiter paired the oysters with some excellent wine.  Finally we got another 1/2 dozen of the other (more mild) and finished everything off with the wonderful bread pudding.  All of this for $80!  It was awesome to sit right next to where the chef was shucking the oysters.  Also the horseradish that they served with the oysters is super freshly grated!  It was awesome!  Just watch out how much you put on because it can get really spicy.  This was one of my most favorite meals while I was in Vegas.  And I will be going back to this place again!"}
{"text":"Great place for clam chowder! Fast, friendly service! would recommend & would visit again!"}
{"text":"Service is horrible!  The sign at the hostess area said to seat yourself, no problem.  After about 10 minutes a server came to our table.  Even though we were ready to order, he only took our drink order.  Seemed irritated that my wife only ordered water to drink.  I ordered a soft drink.  He brought 2 waters, no soft drink, and we never saw him again.  A table of four came in about 10 minutes after he took our drink order.  He took their order, brought them their alcoholic drinks  and then put their order into the computer.  After 20 minutes we finally left as it was clear that he had no intention of serving us.  We run a small business here in Vegas and typically tip our server(s) at least 20-30%.  We often are asked to recommend restaurants in Vegas to our customers.  Guess who we won't be recommending.  STAY AWAY FROM THIS PLACE!"}
{"text":"This place wasn't too bad. I always passed it by thinking they only serve oysters, which I don't eat. But they don't. They serve all types of Cajun food, which I love. Too bad there isn't a way for them to advertise this. I got their seafood gumbo. It was good although a tad slimy because of the okra in it. They had a couple of other delicious-sounding Cajun things that I would like to try. Next time!"}
{"text":"Foodstuff great, good amount of seafood and the flavorings are on point.  The -4 stars is for the waitress bringing 2 cups of water for 4 people then saying she'll bring the rest and disappearing. We asked for hot sauce, never got it, we sat for 30 mins before the only server that was left took our order. Another 20 minutes waiting for the check. Either hire more servers or just don't try to cram seats and serve customers. The table next to us was saying FINALLY when they received their beers after they finished their meals  Changed it to 3 stars cause the food was actually really good.... Just did 1 in the beginning because I was super heated from the service"}
{"text":"Friendly staff.  Yummy seafood.  Stiff cocktails.  'Nuff said.  I had the jambalya and the portion was huge.  Hubby had the pan roast and said it was the right amount of food."}
{"text":"The clam chowder and combo pan roast are legit. We (2 people sharing) had some left over of each, which we happily used as a dip later. The price is good too; we paid $30+tip. Check it out."}
{"text":"Started with a variety dozen of oysters all of which were exceptional. The only weak part of the entire meal was that they were not properly shucked - the muscle was not severed on a single one of them. Really I should downgrade my rating to a 4 on that issue alone - this is an oyster bar after all. But...  The pan roast was incredible. Shrimp, lobster, crab, clams, mussels, scallops in a creamy tomato sauce with rice. Could not get enough of that dish.  We'll be back."}
{"text":"This place puts sucks in \"sucks donkey balls\" I don't know what the other yelpers are talking about but by far the worst oysterbar ... The oysters were grimy and slimy and the dishes were at best borderline microwave quality ... Would never recommend this place unless I didn't like you"}
{"text":"Our favey oyster bar for oysters. (Not pan roast but def oysters) our first visit we ended up getting 30 oysters (we usually get a dozen and that's it) but the oysters Royale with the creme freche and wasabi caviar were awesome! So we kept ordering more and more. Bartender is great and service from staff is great. Clam chowder also awesome. Pan roast was good but a little on the sweet side and not creamy like we are used to. We will call it a healthy version. But a tomato butter cream sauce isn't meant to be healthy haha. Great place!"}
{"text":"One of our favorite spots for oysters and our absolute favorite pan roast in town! (They usually pack me just the sauce Togo for $6 and we make stuff at home with it lol) great service and usually don't have to wait to sit unlike their sister property palace station."}
{"text":"Our food was absolutely the best oysters we've ever had! The only reason I only put 4 stars was because the service was not great. They were not helpful or friendly and kept trying to give us other people's food... the food we did get was all top notch!"}
{"text":"If you like steak shrimp and oysters  this place  does the job   sit at the bar  fast service no frills"}
{"text":"Another great spot that Yelpers lead me to. The decor and the high tables and chairs weren't ideal, but the food was outstanding.   Following Yelpers' advice, we tried the clam chowder to start, and as reviewed, it was outstanding, reminiscent of the best I'd had in Boston.   We also received some good bread to start our meal, which was nice.   We then followed with an oyster dish, forget the name, but it was oysters with spinach and parmesan and a horseradish sauce on the side. AWESOME. We ordered six, but I would've liked about twenty more.   We then had the shrimp jambalaya, which although not entirely NO authentic, was still very good. The shrimp were especially good. It seemed they'd been grilled first and then thrown in the jambalaya, creating a really complex flavor.   I really liked this spot. I also liked that by strategically ordering the chowder and the oysters, we were able to save some money, as the place is on the expensive side if you get chowder, an appetizer and two entrees."}
{"text":"Came for oysters. Was disappointed on their varieties, not many to chose from. What I order was ok, but expected more from an oyster bar. Pasta was great though..."}
{"text":"I took my husband here for his birthday with two other couples. Let's just say we all absolutely loved our oysters. We kept ordering oyster shooters, grilled oysters, deep fried oysters and Rockefeller oysters. We spent a lot but it was totally worth it. This review is coming from someone who has had my first two oyster experiences bad ones. The place is small yet intimate with an open kitchen where you can see how the cooks prep your oysters. Service is fast and courteous. We will be returning customers."}
{"text":"I am a major oyster fan and normally only eat east coast oysters nut I have been converted. Our server Ly convinced us to try the Shigokoo and Kushi oysters amd my lord they were amzing. We ate a doz of each raw and a half doz of each grilled as well. WOW WOW WOW"}
{"text":"Let me begin by saying it was a HUGE mistake to have come here one hour before they close. Kevin was the cook last night and all he wanted to do was fill orders and get out of the kitchen! This was my sons first visit to The Oyster Bar and my first time at this Station location. I always go to the Palace Station Oyster Bar. The Palace station has THE BEST flavor infused dishes. Texas station was okay but here at Sunset station oyster bar Kevin ruined the art of cooking these delicious meals by making every thing watery and flavorless!!! He didn't give the ingredients time to boil and release all the flavors or allow time for broth to thicken. Now here's the bullshit. I brought home what I didn't finish last night and as I scoop up that watery slop with my spoon a RUBBER BAND emerged from under my shrimp and okra!!!! Holy shit dude really? Kevin is a sloppy ass lazy cook and if he's the one at the helm when you go visit this location just turn around and walk back out. His cooking is NOT WORTH $60+."}
{"text":"Been here a couple of times and sat at the bar. Service is always quick and good. This time I ordered the mussel steamers with pasta & fra  Diablo sauce & my husband had Bourbon Street Jambalaya with shrimp. Both dishes were excellent. However, I can't help but to compare it to the Oyster Bar at Palace Station & I still lean more towards Palace Station. If I had never been to the other I would have gave it 5 stars."}
{"text":"I Was excited to learn the former owner of Glutton, Bradley Manchester, is the executive chef here. The menu consists of typical oyster bar items along with new additions that make the menu stand out from other oyster bars. Was left a little disappointed.   Service was a joke. The waitress was lost. Only 16 or so seats & the chefs were cleaning the table area. Not the 2 waitresses on staff. Very limited service from them. A chef shouldn't have to clean when he has a second when he's cooking for everyone. They give you complimentary chips with your meal that we noticed other people enjoying. We had to ask for them.. Along with water & it took forever. Plus we had to ask to have the previous diners dirty dishes taken away. She kept thinking it was ours. Nice girl but with only 16 seats or so I can't understand the bad service. WTF!!!!!!!  Tuna tacos wonderful, 5/5. Shrimp and grits to die for 5/5. Linguine and clams thumbs down. Worst I've ever had. For starters it's not even linguine but fettuccini noodles.  Weird pieces of what they call \"clams\" were red chunks of rubbery ??????? Some of the shelled clams were a little gritty. The sauce was not that bad but I wouldn't order it again. Could be a gem.  Needs work....maybe they were having an off day."}
{"text":"Always good for a seafood fix.   Service seemed slow tonight.   Oh well,  Saturday night.  Extremely busy.   We'll be back."}
{"text":"20 minutes waiting.. Took 10 just to get a basket of bread. A party of 10 or so gets here after us and gets served before us. Service is horrible.. Waiter dropped bread and never checked on us again. Never got our food left before airing another 20 minutes ."}
{"text":"Freaking good food. No lines when I came :) Jaime & Eric are the best servers ever. The gumbo tastes amazing and is super quick to serve. Came around 4:30/5 to eat :) bomb af food. MUST TRY"}
{"text":"Wow this place has gone downhill. We are locals, and used to go here often. Haven't in about a year. Now we live close by, and we were excited to be near it again.  Just left there, after having a terrible dining experience. Arrived at 840. Place was not busy at all, but no one served us. We had to finally get someone's attention for water. 15 minutes later, had to beg someone to take our food order. Also, Ordered a martini, it was awful and watered down. We ordered a gin and tonic, got a gin and water, sent it back, and we still got charged for it. We ordered a glass of Moscato, and was told they were out of moscato. We ordered a lump crap cocktail, and we were told they were out of those too. We were basically being ignored. Food took over 40 minutes to arrive.  After 30 minutes we complained to management, and they basically shrugged their shoulders. Our lobster pan roasts finally arrived, and they were blah and tasteless. Check arrived, no compensation for the bad service. $85 lesson learned. Will not return."}
{"text":"The Oyster Bar is located inside the Harrah's hotel. I stopped to have a light snack while waiting on my hubby to get out of a meeting. The restaurant had just opened and I had the luxury of being their first patron of the day.   I kicked my meal off with a drink of course. It's Vegas!! I tried the blueberry bash. The drink consist of skyy ginger vodka mixed with muddled mint and blueberries on the rocks. It was pretty tasty and also reminded me of one my favorite drinks.   The waitress brought over a bowl of hot rolls and crispy sesame toast. Both were pretty good. The sesame toast was crisp like a chip with a slight buttery garlic flavor.   I ordered the crab cakes from the appetizer menu. It was seasoned lump crab meat garnished with field greens and red pepper aioli. It was the perfect portion for me to subside the hunger I was feeling and still have room for dinner later.   I enjoyed my meal and my waitress was great!"}
{"text":"Good stuff! Pan roast!! After hitting a fee dispensary this place came in clutch!!!! I would come back for sure  They even have tapatío hot sauce"}
{"text":"What an amazing restaurant. From beginning to end, every thing was delicious. Our lunch started off with complimentary house made potato chips, that were lightly seasoned with spices. My friends and I ordered a dozen oysters, and they were very fresh. The oysters were shucked right in front of us and it was an amazing site to see. My friend had the Pan Roasted Mussels, which were absolutely delicious. She was given a bowl of many mussels that were soaked in a beer based sauce. Even though it was beer based, the sauce was still very light and tasty. It had hints of cheese and had a slight smokiness to it, where the smokiness came from the bits of bacon that were put in the sauce. The dish was accompanied by two thick slices of bread, which soaked up the sauce very well. My other friend and I shared the Classic Crab Pan Roast, which was absolutely delicious. We were surprised by the giant chunks of crab that spread throughout the pan roast, and the amount of chunks were not stingy. it was in a thick. tomato based sauce that did not overpower the natural sweetness of the crab. The slight saltiness in the sauce accentuated the sweetness of the crab.  This place was absolutely wonderful. A great place to take all seafood lovers."}
{"text":"I woke up from a nap and immediately turned to Mr. Hottie and demanded oysters. He raised a brow and I knew he was thinking \"Great. What's this going to cost me??\" So I hopped on Yelp to find reasonably priced oysters. I found Oyster Bar and read Su K's review regarding the place being a good deal and I was sold!      We hit the door dressed up for a fab night out. We arrived at Oyster Bar around 10pm. I ordered a glass of prosecco and we ordered a dozen oysters. Oyster Bar carries 3 kinds of oysters on any given night, so we mixed the variety up. Actually, I let Mr. Hottie mix things up and I sat back and sipped my beverage!      The oyster quality was great! Some of the oysters were fresh and briny, others were soft and buttery. The freshness of each oyster was without question! We also ordered the mussels. Now I'm not a huge fan of mussels and these didn't win me over. They were a tad overcooked in my opinion; still the broth was full of flavor.      We sat at the actual bar of the restaurant and our waiter was attentive and talkative. He was also preparing the food behind the bar! He kept checking on our food and making sure we had everything we needed.      Oyster Bar is one of the best bargains I have seen in a while in Vegas. A dozen oysters were 20 bones with all condiments included. Was this a fancy seafood restaurant? No. It's a casual place to stop in, have a drink and have some fresh oysters before heading out for the evening! I will definitely be back to visit!"}
{"text":"So slow waiting 13 minutes at the food bar no one know's i'm here. The pan roast Was bland in flavor. Just a bad experience. Doubt I would come here again."}
{"text":"Okay.... So this place had horrible service. I had to get up and walk to a waiter TWICE for a refill on water. The OBs pan roast was pretty decent.... However the ribeye... OH MY GOD IT WAS HORRIBLE! The worst steak ever! The medium steak ordered was WELL DONE... The well done tasted like dirty charcoal and it was prepared as medium well....Save yourself the Money and go to sizzler or something.... For being on the strip this place was a total dud... Spago... Cheesecake Factory... Serendipity.... Grand Lux Cafe.... Any Other buffet on the strip! So many Better options than this oyster bar and grill place.... Spare yourselves the agony... That is all hope y'all find a good place to eat on the strip (which you will as long as it's not this place....)"}
{"text":"I was delighted with my meal here.  I had the steamed clams, without pasta, which came heaped in a big bowl.  They were steamed in a garlicky, creamy broth that was really really really delicious. After I had eaten each and every one, I dipped buttered bread into the broth and almost fainted from joy.  My husband had a giant plate of fried oysters that both of us thought were terrific.  My sister and brother in law had a crab Louis that was lovely and generous with the crab meat, although could have used more actual lettuce.  Also shared a good sized portion of fried calamari.     It was exactly what I wanted.  I used to love raw oysters but was poisoned in Texas from raw gulf oysters and can no longer indulge.  I was so envious of those were partaking around us. This is the best restaurant at Harrah's, in my humble opinion.   Priced were fair and reasonable and service was fine."}
{"text":"I visited the Oyster Bar while in Vegas this past July. Very small restaurant in the middle of the Harrah's casino, but a definite seafood gem.  I opted for the 1/2 lb of the Alaskan king crab legs. The crab legs were HUGE and AMAZING-- they are served already cut with lemon and butter. The best part of all was that they gave me a whole pound instead of a half -- on the house (WIN).  My friend opted for the pan seared Scottish salmon which looked delicious!  Service was good and the place was quiet and clean.  Pricey, but worth it!"}
{"text":"Most of the time when I travel to Las Vegas, I will hit some of the different Station Casinos, but I most definitely try to stop by the Oyster Bar at Sunset Station. I love to sitting on the Bar and watch the cooks prepare my meal.  They bring you a menu and an assorted basket of bread and lavash.   Mmmm ...What should I order ? It's normally for me a toss up between Cioppino or Bouillabaisse with a bowl of rice and a cold glass of chardonnay.   Wow! No matter what I do order it's so delicious and makes my mouth water just thinking about now!  I guess gambling with the Station Casino 'Boarding Pass' Card does payoff. I never end up paying a thing for my meals..FREE..I love It!  The service is friendly and the atmosphere is relaxing.  Recommended!"}
{"text":"Love love love their Jambalaya! Mildly spiced, not too salty, and comes with a lot of shrimp and sausages. One order costs $20 but it is well worth the price.  I've had this place bookmarked for over a year and I'm so glad I finally got to try it. Definitely going back to try other things."}
{"text":"We make sure we eat here at least once when we visit Las Vegas. Sitting at the bar is fun because you get to be up close to the chefs and watch them create mouth watering meals. My husband loves their pan roast which consists of lobster, crab, fish, clams, mussels, shrimp and scallops. It's served with a great sauce on a bed of rice. When the sea bass is available, he loves that too. You need a pretty big appetite to finish the pan roast.  I will order the oysters (well done), and the blackened sea scallops on linguine. I'm allergic to lobster and crab (bummers), but there are so many choices on the menu, I have a lot of other meals and appetizers to try."}
{"text":"I didn't eat Oyster at this Oyster Bar haha but these 2 dishes I had were just so amazing! Seriously I can order them million more times! It was also so fun that I could see how all the seafood goodies were prepared. The chef who was taking care of me was really friendly and he made me feel cozy when I was sitting by myself at the counter :) I will come back here for sure next time I'm in Vegas!"}
{"text":"Jaw dropping good! Fresh, tasty and the kitchen design is a beautiful view. You can see the cooks and your food lol. Decently priced, exceptionally great food. Can't wait to see you again"}
{"text":"I always order the shrimp special. Its a pound of shrimp anyway you like it, and it comes with 4 domestic beers. My favorite is the Hot Louisiana, its delicious garlic spicy broth with big peel and eat shrimp, its served with sourdough rolls, flat bread and oyster crackers.   The oysters on the half shell are oh so fresh, have never had a bad one. They are served over ice with horseradish, cocktail sauce and lemons. Simplicity is what makes these perfect."}
{"text":"This place was amazing!   My boyfriend and I went for lunch on a Saturday.   It's a small place, offers eating at the bar and a few booths. Our server was Raymundo. He called himself the \"soup king...\" HE IS DEF A SOUP KING!   He recommended the Cioppino, spicy. Best thing I had this trip!   We also had a dozen oyster sampler and oyster Rockefeller. Everything was so good!"}
{"text":"This has become one of my favorite restaurants in Vegas. Absolutely delicious and best pan roast I've ever had. The oysters were very plump/juicy and filled with fresh flavor as well. This place is as good as it gets. The wait is a bit long, maybe about an hour, but well worth it."}
{"text":"Excellent seafood and much better wait times than the Oyster Bar at Palace Station. We had the seafood risotto, pan roast, and Cajun scallops. All were delicious.  The risotto portion didn't look that big when I started but it was rich and I ended up not being able to finish it. The scallops were large and sweet. The pan roast's flavor was great with a slight kick."}
{"text":"Good food and service as usual. Please kick the singer in Austin's bar to the curb. She can't carry a tune in a bucket. Here's a tip, when the wait staff and kitchen staff can complain about her singing over all the loud noise in a kitchen, she sucks."}
{"text":"I can't write a review because  it's closed when on yelp it says it's  open till 2 am for a business  that wants  customers  get your time correct  thanks for wasting  my time!!!!!"}
{"text":"I'm not sure why anyone has given this place higher than two stars.  I love oysters and was super excited to visit this alleged \"hidden gem\".  The service was bad, the menus double as place mats and they were sticky.  My beer was warm.  The Vegas prices were present without the Vegas experience.  I won't be returning and don't recommend you try it."}
{"text":"Maybe because this was the first substantial meal I've had during my visit to Vegas, but this place is phenomenal and affordable. It's located in Harrah's on the first floor and fairly easy to find. I really liked their mashed potatoes - they taste good by itself but also with the soup from the seafood clay pot. The service is also incredible - our server constantly came by to make sure we were content with the food and to make sure we had everything we wanted.   Overall, this place is stellar and if you're trying to ball on a budget, check this place out!"}
{"text":"the plan was to have a nice meal before an 830 show at Club Madrid. if the cooks spent more time cooking and less time watching college basketball maybe we would have been able to wait for our food. Sorry- it doesn't take 30 minutes for a seafood bake and Etoufee. after waiting  20 minutes we were told it would be another 10 minutes because the 3 cooks each had 10 tickets. that's 30 tickets in a place that had a 40 person occupancy. We canceled the order and left. It's a shame because we were looking forward to trying their food. Just a poorly run kitchen."}
{"text":"Service was TERRIBLE! Had to wait 45 minutes for our dinner while the restaurant was maybe half full.  Not sure what happened for it to take so long.  Food was ok.  I ordered shrimp scampi. It had way too much lemon juice.  And shrimp wad not properly cleaned."}
{"text":"All of us were sick a few hours after eating here. Proceed with caution. Service was slow and unfriendly. Best part of our meal was the bread. Very disappointing."}
{"text":"I'm glad this restaurant has finally opened!!! We had lunch here today and was not disappointed. The menu is simple but everything sounded delicious. We ended up ordering a seafood sampler for our appetizer, plus the combination pan roast (lobster, crab, and shrimp) and the coconut seafood stew. Everything was very tasty and we'll definitely be back. I gotta give a shoutout to Chef Chad and his buddy Chris for their awesome service!!!"}
{"text":"This PLACE IS B O M B ! I recommend 100%, 2nd time being here after a month, I live in the Bay Area, it's not a place I've been to like this thus far! I brought 2 of my friends everyone had 0 COMPLAINTS! & customer service was on point, I'm still sitting her waiting for my check writing this review...."}
{"text":"3 1/2 stars.  I've been here 3 times already.  The 1st time was the best and that was a few years ago.  They had 3 different types of oysters and had some Alaskan beer that went well with it.  Today, only 2 types (blue points and fanny bay) and no more Alaskan beer.    I can eat raw oysters all day.  Seriously.  I've had 4 dozen in one sitting before and could eat more.  I mean, oysters don't even fill you up.  But the problem is, oysters tend to be kinda pricey.  That's honestly what stops me from sitting around all day and eating them.  I just run out of money.  I took my friends here-especially Luis because every time I'm at an oyster bar I text him.  I've been doing this for the past 3-4 years and I think this place started this traditional.  Well, we finally met up in Vegas so of course I have to take him.  I get some raw oysters and a dozen of their baked oysters.  Art discovers he's not too keen on raw oysters.  Well, it is an acquired taste.  James is allergic to shellfish and John and Luis don't mind them.  In fact, Luis orders the tequila shot oysters.  I can't honestly remember the last time I had a oyster shooter.  So we split all this.  The oysters are good.  The baked ones are really good.  It's rare that I enjoy cooked oysters whether baked or fried but these are really good.  I definitely recommend them.  The shooters are pretty good too.  I mean, tequila and raw oysters just mix well.    I can't say this is the best oyster bar in Vegas.  In fact with only 2 types of oysters I suspect it's not.  But for the strip it's gtg."}
{"text":"The first time we went here, we just wasn't impressed. It was just my hubby and I. The service was below par, food took over an hour to get, just wasn't excited to ever go again. However, we did go again. This time with 6 of our friends. Honestly, they totally redeemed themselves. The waitress, Farrha, was the best. We ordered 3 orders of raw oysters, 1 Oysters Rockefeller, 2 shrimp cocktail, 2 orders of crab legs, many oyster shooters, etc...she not only kept up with us, she kept a very positive, joking attitude the whole time. She made the experience completely different. All of the food was fantastic, fresh. We will be going back again!"}
{"text":"This was a really good place to hangout after walking around the strip all night. We stopped here for oysters n drinks before heading back up to the room.  The food was really fresh and the service was great."}
{"text":"I was a little hesitant eating oysters hung over. I have a super sensitive stomach and raw oysters are not a number one choice at any time hung over.  BUT i love oysters especially fresh raw delicious oysters. We order a dozen raw oysters with crab cakes. The oysters are fresh and the crab cakes were delicious! For only $30 for two people I would definitely suggest Oyster Bar for a quick seafood fix!"}
{"text":"PAN ROAST!! This is the reason why I come here. I've tried their other food and it's all great but dat Pan Roast doe. All the seafood taste fresh, service is great, restaurant's clean and the cooks are always cool. My friend recommended the Bloody Mary but I thought it was very ordinary. I don't eat oysters but my friends say they are very good here. But again, come here for the Pan Roast, droooool."}
{"text":"ahhhhh brah. perspektive. when i read the reviews on yelp i wuz ready to trip.. even brought my moms-- an old skool shucker from the dirty south gulf coast.  service wuz great.. but... oysters.. nahhhh bruh.  they were TINY.. looked all cute on my plate.. but for $20 ?!?.. this may be a bargain to you kind folks on the left coast, but i've had much much better, bigger, saltier, fresher oysters at the likes of acme oyster house and felix's in n'awlins.. & paid less than $9/dozen. listen, you gots to go to know. the tuna roll-- 1 out of  5 stars, the lobster bisque-- tasted like it came from a can of campbell's soup.  this dude wuz disappointed. and mom confirmed-- she wuz like, \"yo, son.. you gots to do betta than dis\". sorry, mom.  next stop in vegas, chinatown. stay tuned."}
{"text":"This place was a train wreck tonight. Our poor waiter was so overextended. Ordered a bottle of Chardonnay delivered unchilled.  Ordered crab cakes and bacon wrapped shrimp and scallops, along with Old Bay fries. The fries came about 20 minutes after we had eaten the other appetizers, which actually were very good. The preprepared bread basket consisted of a crunchy cracker and stale rolls. Do not recommend."}
{"text":"My friend and I were almost nearing broke when Chef \"Nameless\" from the Oyster Bar called out to us and told us to take a seat at the bar. We told him our wallets couldn't handle the Oyster Bar, but he insisted that we try out his food. I have always wanted to try this place out so i didn't put up much of a fight haha. We sat down and ordered a dozen oysters ($20) and gobbled them down with horseradish, tabasco, and pepper- my fave. They give you  complimentary crispy flatbread with your order, and our chef gave us a try of different types of oysters and sesame flatbread. SO NICE! We enjoyed every last drop and crumb of our in-between-meal, meal. I love the service (he ended up hooking it up fatty $$$) and the food. This is definitely going to be a must-visit spot in this city."}
{"text":"Very fast and great service! Party of four two dozen raw oysters!!!! We will come back!!!"}
{"text":"I seriously don't know how this place got four stars. I guess Yelp is not as reliable as I thought. We came here after reading all these great reviews on Yelp. We ordered half a dozen of oysters to share, and I ordered a seafood bouillabaisse, my hubby ordered a jambalaya, since they don't have kids menu, I asked our waiter if I could have some plain white rice and a piece of chicken for my toddler (just a plain white rice and a dry chicken breast, they charged me 11 dollars!!!). The oysters were fresh but quite small since they were blue points. My dish was full of seafood, but lack of any favorite, the booth tasted just like the water from steaming the seafood with salt:(and my hubby only had a few bites of his jambalaya; he said it didn't taste right. I tried and I was like he was right, the jambalaya tasted like a rice mixed with a big can of tomato with sugar.   Our waiter was not too attentive; and when he brought us the bill, we got charge an extra order of a jambalaya (20 bucks more) and alSo noticed that he charged us 11 dollars for the kid meal (again just plain white rice with a small piece of dry chicken breast) Good that I checked...I pointed out an extra dish that we didn't order to him and he fixed the bills.  We didn't order any drink, but the bills came out about 90 dollars; for a meal like this with the kind of service at this kind of restaurant was totally overpriced!   Will not recommend and will not be back again!!! The meal was not good and price was not right. Take your money and go else where."}
{"text":"The Oyster Bar is a great place to grab a bite to eat or to have a full meal.  You can either sit at the bar or get a table.  If you sit at the bar, you can watch them prepare and cook your meal.  The oysters a really fresh.  The raw ones are shucked in front of you--they're delicious!  There are also a few ways that they prepare the cooked ones.  I really like their version of oysters rockerfeller.  The Oyster Bar always has white and red clam chowder daily.  I personally prefer the red.  It's very tasty with lots of bits of clams.  My friends get the white version, and they say it's really good too.  For the entrees, over the years, I've probably tried everything on the menu, and it's all good.  Although, there are small differences depending on who actually cooks your food.  We've been regulars for years, and personally, we really like to sit with Dennis.  He's really nice and personable, and his cooking is terrific.  The surf and turf with the steak and lobster is one of their signature entrees.  It comes with potato wedges which are so delicious!  I also really like their bouillabaisse--get it with pasta and you have instant seafood linguine.  The jambalaya is awesome too.  I think that the only thing that was so-so was the catch of the day.  We've gotten it several times, and it always underwhelms.  The portions are pretty big, so we never have space left for dessert!"}
{"text":"Tucked away in the corner of the casino close to the HRH tower, Oyster Bar has the best food I've had at the Hard Rock Hotel. Like seafood? Stop by the Oyster Bar.   It's bar-seating only in this cozy joint which only makes the meal more intimate. You get a prime view of your meal getting made and get to interact with the chefs. The folks that work here are all just absolutely lovely. The food though is where it's at. I had the popular \"all-in\" classic pan roast and it was a rich dish chocked full of lovely, fresh seafood like shrimp, fish, crab, and lobster served with white rice. With every bite you're gonna get a nice serving of seafood. Bringing all the seafood together was an incredibly indulgent pan sauce with all the yummy seafood flavor plus cream and cognac. I was so satisfied by the end of the meal.   The folks here are really accommodating and they can make a seafood steamer on request (not on the menu but think that's what I'll try the next time I'm back). So glad I found a new favorite place to eat at the Hard Rock."}
{"text":"Having been to the Oyster Bar at Palace Station, I had the bar set high.  This one is almost the same, it's much closer to home and I didn't have to wait to get a table.  I still prefer the original, however will definitely come back given the convenience.  And you can't beat tasty jambalaya at $6.99!"}
{"text":"Seat yourself with NO wait! Delicious baked garlic and herb oysters, clam chowder, and Pan roast! You can pick your spice preference too! All super yummy. Last but not least, the outstanding waitress, Farha, was THE BEST waitress I've had since moving to Vegas. She was super friendly and knowledgeable with such great energy! Definitely going back here! =))"}
{"text":"Was great, just slightly off from Palace Station Pan Roast but very similar and very good. Best part there wasn't a 2-3 hour wait.  Service was great. We started w a cup of New England clam chowder and a dozen oysters.  Clam chowder was delicious and flavorful. The oysters were meaty and perfect.  We have tried several of the pan roasts in town palace by far is the best but I will say Texas is a very close second"}
{"text":"Misleading. Pan roast is not the typical creamy thick blended pan roast and comes at a heafty price. No point coming here.  Calamari was mostly deep fried breading.  Lobster bisque was beyond salty.   Party of 9 ordered a couple more items but everyone was disappointed.   Reason there's absolutely no wait to eat at this place. Dont waste your money."}
{"text":"This place was aight. Not that fancy and I somehow confused it with another oyster bar at The Palace Station, so I was deeply disappointed when I found out they were two different places. Considering I was staying at the Harrah's and I needed a quick bite before heading out for the night, this was a close option without going too ham.   I order a half dozen oyster with wasabi caviar and a clam chowder. I guess I wasn't that hungry so this was enough to fill me up. Thankfully, they do offer a basket of bread and sesame chip/cracker thing...a lot of it.   The oysters were whatevs. The oyster themselves were fresh and a little bit briny since they were medium sized, but I thought the creme fraiche and a huge dollop of wasabi caviar was a bit excessive. I had to scoop most of it off and just douse it with a lot of lemon juice. The creme fraiche was so thick and creamy and the wasabi caviar, tasteless. It didn't have that kick of spicy I was expecting. It would have been better if it was just wasabi creme served on the side.   Clam chowder was your typical run of the mill bowl of clam chowder. Nothing to write home about.   Also, if you have a Total Rewards card, there will be some discounts for you! A couple dollars off for most of the menu so I can't say everything was bad. :P"}
{"text":"I'm not a fan of oysters but a friend of ours wanted to eat here so we gave it a try! I had the seafood risotto which was super yummy! It has one whole lobster tail, big shrimps, a couple of clams and mussels. The waitress was a bit rude using the word \"huh?!\" one too many times while taking our order. The calamari wasn't anything to rave about, thin small rings what was more batter than squid. The restaurant is very small. Prices are ok."}
{"text":"My dad and I used to come to this oyster bar pretty often. The oysters are great and I highly recommend eating their pan roast!  Honestly, my dad and I have been to a lot of oyster bars and I have to say I think this one is my favorite."}
{"text":"This Place is Amazing. The food, drinks, and service was excellent.  We ordered the dozen East & West Coast Oysters, Ahi Tuna Tacos, Calamari fries, and the Classic Pan Roasts..Sweet Christmas. Chef Sergio and the entire team was on point. Definitely recommend this place, also its at the famous Hard Rock Cafe. Can't wait to come back here."}
{"text":"We keep coming here. Service is pretty good, nice vibe, but tbh the food really doesn't impress. We started coming for the oysters, but on our recent visits, there are always a couple of oysters that taste fishy. Not off, but not anything I'd really want to put in my mouth. If you can't rely on the oysters at an oyster bar, probably good idea to try somewhere else."}
{"text":"Wow the service from our server moon was amazing!!   The oysters didn't disappoint.  We had the grilled ones and our friends had the rockerfeller.  Both were awesome.  We only paid for the dozen price.  Our server Moon is awesome.   I had Chilean sea bass for main course.  Wow.  Delicious.  Interesting it came with Chinese rice.  Maybe this place is owned by asians.  I love it.   Hubby had just clam chowder.  He wasn't super hungry.  Made with surf clam.  Yummy.  My friend had surf and turf.  We heard the steak can get over cooked and it was for one of them but Moon was quick to exchange it.  Lobster to me was overlooked but my friends loved it. The steak at medium was awesome.   Worth a visit. ;-)"}
{"text":"Been coming here for several years, we always stay here when were heading to Lake Mead.  It is my favorite spot for seafood, I love the peal and eat shrimp (ask to go light on the seasoning) The crab legs are really good as well!!! But the clam chowder is my favorite.  I love this place its so delicious!!!! If you're ever in the area you should really stop by."}
{"text":"I went simply to get a dozen oysters and that's what I got.  They were great, shucked freshly behind the bar, good horseradish.  The only reason I didn't give 5 stars is because I was behind a pole from where the wait staff hung out and was neglected (out of sight, out of mind).  But $20 for a great dozen of oysters is worth a bit of a wait for a beverage refill."}
{"text":"Service and atmosphere was great.  They give two types free bread that are tasty.  My table ordered the chicken caesar salad and the scallop pasta. The salad was yummy: dressing amount was perfect and salad topping were good. The pasta was not good because the sauce was thin, bland and not creamy. Overall a pretty plain dish for $25. But the seafood was cooked well."}
{"text":"My girlfriend and I visited the Oyster Bar at Harrah's twice.  Once on 12/26/15 for a few oysters and then for lunch on 12/27/15.  We were impressed.  Photos to be posted soon.   They have a nice selection of BIG oysters for your palate.  I tried a half dozen Fat Bastar* (yes, that's what they call them) and they were delicious.  We also split the catch of the day, which was Sea Bass.  Very good.  Cooked with large shrimp and scallops.  Couldn't get enough, it was that great.  Reasonably priced for what you get.  Raymundo is the chef.  He is great and has been working there over 10 years.  Call on him to make you something special.  No two orders are the same!!  DEE LISH!"}
{"text":"I thought I had tried oysters before.  I was wrong.  Very wrong. if I had, I would have remembered.  That statement is both a good one and a bad one.  The oysters I tried here were of good quality - not fishy, and quite large. However, after about three I had enough of the texture and passed on my last one.  I would eat oysters again if just to compare my experiences.    I then had the shrimp scampi which had amazing flavors and a lot of  garlic (which I love).  My dining partners had the clam chowder, which was described as average.  The sourdough bread was hot and delicious.  The crab pan roast was also enjoyed.  It was very spicey, but had complex flavors.    The restauraunt is not large, but the water falls around it drown out the casino noise.  I guess all Station casinos in Vegas have descent oyster bars, I'm sure equal experience would be had at all."}
{"text":"Just thought I would stop in and take a look at the menu. Lots of interesting menu items! The shrimp cocktail features 4 gigantic prawns with some great spicy cocktail sauce. The gumbo was like sided with chicken and andouille sausage. Finish with an oyster shooter! Ask for Jade, she is the most adorable server I have met in a while!! Going back just to say Hi!"}
{"text":"Hostess is the worst. Stood outside with about 8 others for 15 minutes before being greeted.  No one appears to be bussing tables.  Not an efficient setup."}
{"text":"We were looking for a quick meal that you can usually get here but tonight was AWFUL service. We were told by 2 servers they would be right there. 20 minutes later still no service so we walked out."}
{"text":"We entrusted the help of our fellow yelpers for a good place to eat before going to our show. We turned our sights on the Oyster Bar and unfortunately, it did not live up to the expectation we had set for it.  Luckily for us, we were looking for something light, but we didn't expect having something light would compromise for taste. We ordered two dozen oysters, one served on the half shell ($20) and the Royale ($29) which had caviar and some creme on it. They both came out considerably small (take note of the photos) and the sad part was if you closed your eyes, you would not be able to tell the difference between the two. Til this day, I still don't know what the fuss is over caviar. Anyhow, the oysters were not only small, but lacked in flavor. I was clearly disappointed because I knew I could get about twice as many oysters at my local crawfish house. Sadness.   At least the crab cakes did not disappoint. They were light, crisp, and slightly oily but not bad at all. The sauce accompanied with it was great, but even with that being said, I can't overlook the fact that this oyster bar didn't have good oysters!  It isn't the best place to hang out at either. Your view is basically the casino floor and a small bar area with a display of ice and oysters on them.   Too bad we looked forward to something all weekend that ended up being a huge let down =("}
{"text":"First time my wife and had Oysters!  No need to be seated by a host, just take a seat anywhere. Service was on point.  We loved it! I cant say that I would choose to eat oysters all the time but i did enjoy the experience and we got to try differnt breeds (i had no idea there was different kinds, i also did not realize that they are still alive when you eat em... weird) with different toppings.  I had the surf and turf and can highly recomend it. The fillet mignon was as good as any but it was the lobster tail that had me drooling. Im not a huge fan of Lobster tail as it usually has the texture of prawns. This tail was the most tender piece of meat! The flavor was off the chain and it was as tender as a piece of white fish. LOVED IT!"}
{"text":"Awesome place! Food was on point... And service is outstanding. Chef was right there out in the mix.. recommended!!"}
{"text":"This was a really uncomfortable dinner mostly because it was my suggestion and everyone hated it.  Everything my mother-in-law ordered was sold out.  They refused to bring her anything to drink despite multiple requests... the list is endless.  At the end of the day, the food that was available was good but the ambiance and the service were lacking."}
{"text":"Our absolute favorite casual restaurant on the Strip. The fish is always fresh and the have the best oysters in LV! They have very fair prices and the service is excellent as well."}
{"text":"I had the grilled oysters here, and, oh. my. goodness. They  were ULTRA delicious!  YUM!  They came with red cocktail sauce, lemon, grated horseradish (the strong, sinus-clearing stuff) plus a standard appetizer of some cracker bread with a roll  that they serve before every order.   Apparently they were grilled with some butter or some sort of oil.  The cracker bread was actually perfect with the oysters, their juices and the oil. I added some Tabasco sauce which they have available, to achieve my own personal taste perfection.   I only ordered a half-dozen, and wished I had ordered the full dozen!  Minus one star for somewhat shoddy service. I originally ordered crab cakes, but after several minutes they came back and said that they had not been able to start them yet and suggested other menu choices - normally I would dock 2-3 stars for this, but my second-choice of the grilled oysters was delicious enough to make me an instant fan of this place."}
{"text":"Very casual ambiance and the food was great!  Had the blue point oysters and returned those, but LY was nice enough to replace them with others - per his recommendation.  The horseradish has to be the hottest I have ever tried, but good! Recommend the lobster bisque in a bread bowl and the jambalaya finished it off!  Can't forget the bloody Mary oyster shooters....heaven!  I like the fact that if you are at the bar, your waiter is also your assigned chef.   I highly recommend this place if you are ever in Vegas!!!"}
{"text":"Seriously over priced!  Beware, almost $30 for 6 oysters.  If you are in Vegas and crave seafood, go to a buffet, it will cost you the same here and you will still be hungry when you leave."}
{"text":"I really didn't find this place to have great good; I also don't eat seafood which might be what you are expected to order here.   I felt like I was eating in the middle of a hallway in the casino as the seating was surrounded by major walkways.  I got the steak and didn't find it to be great. I enjoyed my five dollar steak at Ellis Island more.   I found the food and service to be lacking here. I'll upload a photo when I get a chance.  My girlfriend said the fish and chips was great though!"}
{"text":"Mother took me here on my birthday this past Monday. I'm from New Orleans, so I can appreciate a good gumbo. I see the reviews aren't that great here, well they must have known we were coming. The fried calamari appetizer was good. Crispy, well-seasoned, and plentiful. The gumbo was EXCELLENT, I ordered the one with sausage, shrimp, and crab for 19 dollars. I have a cartoon appetite so I can appreciate the large serving size. Its a nice sized bowl that they fill to the top, and add two big scoops of rice. I was proud to finish the entire bowl, minus one jumbo shrimp (I tried). For drink I ordered a hurricane (5 dollars) which was very strong. As a man, I will never complain about a too strong drink. They're just giving me more bang for my buck. However, after I was almost halfway thru it, I asked her to add some cranberry and pineapple. Much better. The service was prompt and I had absolutely no problem. I watched the playoffs, got stuffed, and even threw some of my money away on the megabucks. I can't wait for an excuse to go back."}
{"text":"This is the second time going here and there oysters are amazing! So fresh, and you can get half a dozen or a dozen. Fresh or cooked. Our waiter, Moon, was very nice. The mix drinks are always on point. It's inside the Harrah's which is convenient for anyone who stays on the strip. You will not be disappointed with their oysters for sure."}
{"text":"So my sister has been telling me about this place for ages, finally had a chance to try it.  I was not disappointing.   Love the casual feeling of this place, you can walk up to the bar and sit or at one of the high tables.    Started off with half dozen oysters, perhaps one of the best, freshest, delicious oysters I had ever tasted! For main course BF had Cioppino and i ordered shrimp scampi pasta.  The pasta dish had too much sauce, waaay to much and I almost sent it back but I ended up putting napkins to suck up some of it (TMI??).  But the flavor was great.  BF loved the  Cioppino, all kinds of differed shell fish in a tomato cream sauce.  They also serve bread and crackers."}
{"text":"YAM! I love their bouillabaisse! About 3 yrs ago my BF was here for a convention and I had lunch here.  I love how small this place is, you can see the cooks prepare your food, and the waterfall surrounding the place. We finally had a chance to drive out there this time we where in LV.  The food was just like I remembered it last time, also tried the house pan roast, deeeelish.  The waiter was very nice and not too pushy which I love.   Highly recommend this place =)"}
{"text":"excellent oysters on the half shell.  excellent clam chowder excellent crab louis excellent service and excellent shucking by derrick"}
{"text":"Oyster Bar at The Hard Rock. They recommended Pacific Oysters. Fast with beverages. They were small oysters but amazingly delicious! The clam chowder was excellent too. Creamy, thick and rich! The staff was fast and friendly! The Shrimp Scampi was not watery but amazing!! I like this Oyster Bar the best of Palace Station Oyster Bar and Harrah's Oyster Bar. (Harrah's is good but expensive)."}
{"text":"Not gonna lie -- I was totally skeptical of all you Yelpers talking about this place. In the middle of a casino? Seriously? That was supposed to be tasty and reasonably priced for Vegas? But that's what you get! We were in the mood for a quick bite before we headed over to the High Roller so we ponied up to the bar, ordered a couple shooters and a dozen a piece.   The shooters - oh my. Mine was a sort of tart ginger concoction that made me instantly want another one. And the oysters were super tasty and fresh, shucked right in front of you. The only disappointment was the service - not the greatest - and we got 2-3 oysters on each of our dozens that were clearly the runts of the litter. I get that if you're running this type of place, you probably try to portion out the runts a little to each customer so they don't complain, but I'd prefer you just tossing those into shooters and giving me the bigger on the half shells. Overall though a nice experience and worth a stop if you're in Harrah's."}
{"text":"Horrid! Two hours!!! It took two hours from the time we sat down to get drinks, food, and our check-ridiculous!  If wasn't a leisure two hours, it was craning our necks-looking for our waitress, wondering if our food would ever come.  I don't know if they were just understaffed or what, but I had to go looking for my own fork :( We ordered oysters Rockefeller, which were cold and tasteless. The lobster boil was no bueno the lobster was tough! Never again!"}
{"text":"It took a while for our food to come out, but it was worth the wait!  The pan roast ($20) was absolutely divine, clam chowder was delicious ($5), and the oysters were super fresh!   Will definitely be coming back =)"}
{"text":"I'm posting this review at 10:35pm and the site says the restaurant closes in 25 mins yet we arrived at 9:55 and the sign said they were closed.  After speaking with host regarding their hours , he said he would speak with the manger and get back to us.  He returned and said that the manager had advised him that they were definitely closed for the evening yet there were still people ordering food who had recently been seated.    As a total rewards diamond member, I was surprised to see this at a restaurant that we frequent quite often.  We spent $60 on cab rides between getting to Harrah's and eventually going  to Javier's as our secondary option.    The general manager of Oyster Bar should definitely be aware of this if he or she isn't already.  We love going to Oyster Bar but that's really bad service and I would never expect that at this establishment."}
{"text":"2nd time here , even made a trip from the strip. The Place was very crowded, but it is soooo understaffed . sure the server was working her ass off , but not up to par , if i ask for a refill of water ,15 minutes is unacceptable. food was just so so .  will not return"}
{"text":"The raw oysters and the beer boiled peel and eat shrimp were delicious!! We also ordered the Oyster Bar Cold Seafood Platter for Two-- not worth the $61. First of all they completely forgot the oysters from the platter. Which they promptly brought out and added an extra two. The King Crab was super salty and didn't taste very good at all. The chef came out to apologize, removed the platter and gave us another round of raw oysters.   We also had the Crab Louie which I didn't taste but it didn't look that great and my mom barely touched it. It seemed to have a lot of mayo.   Good place for drinks and oysters...  The servers were nice"}
{"text":"The Etouffee is exceptional.  So good.  Shrimp cocktail is wonderful.  The price is right too."}
{"text":"We were so excited to find the Oyster Bar @ Harrah's, especially when other yelpers comments included - all the same great food as Palace Station for a little extra $, and no 2-3 hour wait. WRONG. Although we appreciated not having to wait in line for hours, the food was not the same. I craved the the Original Oyster Bar's Pan Roast, but was given hard to crack crab in what tasted like a mildy spicy PORK N BEANS broth. Such a disappointment. Oysters were good, but only served with cocktail sauce. Clam chowder was too watery for my taste. All in all, we will pass up this restaurant and wait the 2-3 hours for the Original Oyster Bar at Palace or Sunset Station."}
{"text":"Awesome customer service! The guys working at the bar/kitchen work so hard and fast! I was amazed at their hustle and food came out delicious. And the margarita drink was just perfect! Would definitely come again"}
{"text":"Prior to eating here - I thought the idea of eating raw Oysters would just be disgusting. However, after eating at the Encore, and having raw oysters - I'm hooked. So, when wandering around to get to the monorail, I notice this place, and we planned to get some more oysters prior to dinner at the NYNY.  So, we stopped here on Tuesday night, around 6:30 pm. There are plenty of places to sit at the bar. We sit down and we already know what to order - a full dozen of raw oysters. They were shucked right in front of us. What a great deal!  The service was very helpful and cheerful. The oysters were incredibly fresh and tasty.   The casino Harrah's is a dump - but this place is really a gem amongst crap. Go here for the Oyster bar (and the monorail). We will return here when we come back to Vegas. Thanks to this place - I'm hooked on raw oysters. Yum Yum. Thank you!"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I were looking for an oyster bar and finally settled on this place. I was a bit apprehensive initially because the more intimate seating all said reserved so the tables we had to sit at we a bit cafeteria style. But I actually ended up loving the food!  Our waiter was truly nice and he recommended an assortment of oysters to us that was Very tasty! I had the Pan Roast and OMG! This was the absolute best thing I'd eaten the entire time in Vegas! My boyfriend got the seafood risotto and he loved it.  I cannot wait to go back to Vegas to eat here!"}
{"text":"I LOVE the food, but sometimes the service lacks something-whether it's to go or dining in it can be really hit or miss with the service. The food on the other hand- NEVER had a problem and it's always delicious. Try the signature pan roast and substitute pasta for rice-you'll thank me later!"}
{"text":"I never liked oysters until I ate the oysters here at Harrah's! Omg so amazing! Open late too!"}
{"text":"Amazing food. My husband and I had oysters on a half shell, peel and eat shrimp, and clam chowder. Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"BEHOLD THE GLORY OF A DELICIOUS PAN ROAST WITHOUT A THREE HOUR WAIT.  Hard Rock Hotel, you should have built the Oyster Bar bigger. Just take out Vanity and make that an Oyster Bar and you'd be set.  I can't wait to come back again.  Anyways, combo pan roast with everything, shrimp, crab, lobster (rice on the side too) spice 4 out of 5. $24. Perfect. (I am still eating it right now)  Corona $8  Free salty ass (yum) chips.  Awesome service. They accept the food coupons out of the Backstage Pass machines too.  You've either been and are trying to keep it for yourself or you're waiting for a review like mine. Well here it is.. Local approved. Get the stantions out Hard Rock because there will be lines soon.  I just want to add something too, Hard Rock, can you add a VIP line for higher tier players? President at Station Casinos does not mean a thing when it comes to a wait at the Oyster Bar at Palace Station. Do that and I will switch forever."}
{"text":"Another great meal at the Oyster Bar this week.  The first time I came here was over ten years ago, when my sister was in LV for her boards review course, and I was the newly-legal baby sis tagging along.  During those days, we were still pinching our pennies, so decided to stay at Harrah's...I have such fond memories of our stay there.  And still, it's Harrah's that I keep returning to--no matter what hotel I sleep at--to play at their tables, and the dealers have always been kind to me there.    But yea, after a weekend of meals over 1, 2, 3, and yes $400 (L'Atelier) for two people at chi-chi snooty restaurants, this was such a nice break.  It still wasn't cheap, but man, were those oysters delicious, the service excellent, and the ambiance just the right amount of cheese-y proletariat fun.  I loved that our server was well-versed on the types of oysters they had, and where they came from...Malpeques from PEI, Blue Points from Long Island, Kumamotos from Willapa Bay, Washington, and Kusshi's from Vancouver.  So. good.  And yes, I'm all about supporting the Gulf economy and their shellfish industry, but maaan, do the oysters from the Northwest and Northeast just kick the silt outta those swampy funky Southern bivalves.   They make a mean bloody mary too.  Awesome!!"}
{"text":"After reading this is the best oyster place on the strip expectations were high. We went there with a party of 8 on a Thursday afternoon around 4pm. We were sat down and given menus. After 15minutes Carlos, our waiter, came over and took drink orders and asked if he wanted separate checks we said yes if possible but no big deal if it's on 1 check. Carlos looked flustered and walked away, I noticed he walked to the back area which wasn't hidden, and was talking to another server moving his hands and pointing at our table frantically. So Carlos comes back now asked if we were ready. My order was 1/2 dozen of oysters and a salad with shrimp but I asked for no onions or peppers. As I was asking for that my friends Carlos was shaking his head! The next order my friend asked if a oyster list was available and he started shaking his head at her and said no and start rambling off oysters which it was so fast it was incoherent. Now everyone in our group realized he was not excited to be waiting on us. So after we ordered we asked for the manager. One of out friends went to the casino floor and noticed Carlos waiting on another table and he said Carlos seemed like a different person smiling and all. Our food comes out oysters we good they were blue points. My salad was disappointing, the shrimp was over cooked and not enough tomatoes. So as we are eating the manager comes over. Now I should add 7 out of 8 of us work in the food service industry 3 out of that 7 are general managers so we know service is important. So we tell the manager how we felt about Carlos' service and it's unacceptable. We also told her about out background in food service and she agreed and wanted to rectify the situation offered discounts which we declined because we aren't free loaders we just wanted to give feedback like we would at our restaurants. So the manager offered grilled oysters which were pretty decent and she said Carlos won't be serving us the rest of our meal. Well 2 minutes later here comes Carlos in a over exaggerated tone asked how is everything? We just stared at him like really dude. But after that we had another server. The prices were high which is probably expected in a casino, for the price I expected better food, and the service was sub par. With this past experience I won't go back."}
{"text":"I love this Oyster Bar inside Suncoast Casino...I always have either the Shrimp Cocktail OR the Crab Cocktail!  Oyster were great too but this time I had opted out and ordered something new...it was similar to a Clam soup but in White Wine...very good!!  Prices were not so bad...what do you expect?? It was inside the casino so they are targeting the tourists...LOL!!!"}
{"text":"Walked in without any reservations and sat ourselves down. Ordered a dozen oysters and their delicious seafood risotto. It was insanely good. Service was slow but it made up for great food.  #FATBASTARD yum"}
{"text":"DEFINITELY NOT RECOMMEND this restaurant. The service was so bad that you can rarely see your server even though the restaurant is empty. This is the worst oyster bar that I've been to, the oysters were not fresh. The plates and sliverware were not clean. The shrimp scampi is tasteless."}
{"text":"I've been coming here for years. The food is always great, never disappoints. I have noticed every cook has there own way of making the dishes. Little details that they each do. You can never go wrong with a signature panroast. The oysters are always fresh and are devoured in minutes. I come here a lot because they wait is never as long as palace. Palace is really good but it's always at least a 2 hour wait. Our servers have always been great, and the chefs are friendly and fast. It would be great if there was a direct number to call. We've tried to order to go several times but can never get through, so we just ended up going and eating there."}
{"text":"By reading reviews from others I am beginning to see the wisdom in visiting a few times before writing a review.   By now I can say that I have tried most of their menu, or at least their main dishes. In my opinion, they excel with their Pan Roasts and with their Bouillabaisse. The Pan Roast is creamy and very flavorful and it seems to be a favorite with others. The Bouillabaisse is amazing and we love it so much we order it often.   I have ordered the oysters on the half shell several times and they for the most part are cold and fresh tasting. However, once they seemed lacking the right temperature and on a different occasion two or three of my oysters seemed less than desirable. These should have been discarded to preserve a higher standard.   They serve wine and a handful of specialty drinks which accompany the meals well. I personally, love the fact that they serve Sapporo on draft.  The menu does provide a good selection of dishes, but, I have learned to stay away from a couple of dishes that don't look appetizing at all. I do recognize that there are multiple variations of these recipes, but, the taste is either overpowering or just bad cooking. No $20.00 dish should be on a menu without checking it for taste or consistency.   I think the service here is good, but, they are challenged when it gets busy. It does suck to see the cooks prepare a good meal only for the food to sit under the heating lamps. Nevertheless, I have been consistently happy with their friendly service. I truly recommend this restaurant."}
{"text":"We arrived on a Friday just after 5pm and had no problems getting a table.  We were greeted immediately and took no time deciding.  We chose to share a bottle of wine,  a Caesar salad with shrimp, steamed littleneck clams, and a signature pan roast.  It was almost too much but everything was so delicious we had to finish every bite.  The salad was very fresh with plenty of shrimp.  The littleneck clams were tender and so flavorful.  The pan roast had amazing flavor with seafood in each bite.  Our server was attentive, I wish I could remember his name.  We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Food amazing still, but when busy service is really bad. They don't take names so it's first come first serve. Waited 20-30 minutes and it was only a party of two with a baby and was the first one waiting in line, yet three parties of two went before us and a party of 6... which I don't understand. Once seated we waited an additional 10 minutes for a server to even come to the table. Yet this server went to two different tables seated after us to get there drinks.   If coming here, come when it's not too busy."}
{"text":"I always go here everytime I'm in Vegas because you can use your points earned from playing at the casino. The best deal is to get the shrimp and oyster combo. Comes with 4 jumbo shrimp and 4 oysters for $16. You can order a dozen of oysters for $18, but I'm the only one that eat it and I can't finish all 12. My husbands just eats the shrimp. If you order shrimp cocktail by itself, there's 5 pieces for $12, kind of a rip in my opinion.  Honestly the best oysters I've ever had. I love their cocktail sauce as well. Great flavor with an extra kick of horse radish. I could eat this every day if possible."}
{"text":"LOVE this place!  Took my dad here when he was out to Las Vegas to visit! He wanted seafood and Oysters, so we tried it out! Great quality food and amazing service here! I typically don't like eating in the casinos, but eating here I didn't feel like I was in a casino! The manager, Jerry, was amazing and checked in to make sure the service and food was great! I will definitely be going back!"}
{"text":"Very delicious sea food, but the waiting time is around 2 hours during weekend. There is only limited seats."}
{"text":"Absolutely loved the Food!!! We were here pretty much throughout our stay @ Hard Rock. I highly recommend you eat here especially if you love seafood! Gumbo, mussels, lobster, Shrimp Grits, Crab cakes, etc.... EVERYTHING ON THE MENU IS DELICIOUS!!!"}
{"text":"I really don't like eating out but I really enjoyed the oyster bar. The service, food was great."}
{"text":"So good, I had a dream about it!  LOL  We were expecting a long wait, but we came around 730pm and sat ourselves right at the bar!  We ordered a dozen oysters, Crab Pan Roast, and a Shrimp & Lobster Fra Diavolo. Paired it with Arrogant Bastard Ale & a glass of moscato!  They were generous with the crab meat in my Pan Roast and it was just a bowl of creamy, tomato-y, crabby goodness!  I also loved their moscato, which completed my dinner!  We've definitely been missing out!  I can't wait to come back and try a Pan Roast with shrimp, crab AND lobster! Mmm.."}
{"text":"The service is very slow not sure it was worth the wait. This was one of my favorite place for spicy seafood dish. They have changed there recipe"}
{"text":"Good food.  Lots of empty seats.  Bad service if you get the old lady server.  She ignores you and I had to ask for the bill.  Didn't really check on us much either.  But I would come back for the food."}
{"text":"Stayed at Harrahs many times, and had oysters there once or twice. Pricey, but good. So this time we decided to have dinner, and to our mild surprise, the food was very good. Service was not so good as it was a busy time, but we were not in a hurry. I had the shrimp scampi and my wife had the OB's Pan Roast. Would definitely return."}
{"text":"Amazing seafood menu! We ordered the salmon, étouffée and the oyster Rockefeller. Our waitress Kat was on to of it. Never asked for refills and she kept us informed of our order. Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"Solid.  Good drinks.  We started with calamari and it was perfect.  We both opted for the fish and chips (listed under apps).  The fish was fried perfectly and portion was not too big and not too small.  Our server was a little salty but that's probably because I was drinking a lot of water.  So much that after about the 6th refill he left a full pitcher on the table.  Which I finished by the way."}
{"text":"One of my favorite places to eat!!!!  The food is fabulous.   It's clean high energy and just amazing food."}
{"text":"Craving Oysters? I am familiar with palace stations oyster bar but I figured to try Sunset Station hoping it's bigger that it would be faster service! Wrong, we arrived around 7:15p and the entire place was filled but we sat at the bar and it took 15 minutes for us to order cocktails but after that the chef took our order immediately.  We ordered oyster shooters and believe it or not they were pretty good! I ordered the shrimp pan roast and half a dozen of oysters on the half shell! The oysters are always delicious and same with the pan roast. It took an hour for our food to arrive but nothing short of great. I love their food but I wish their service was better and the wait shorter!"}
{"text":"I can't say enough about this place.  Since it's launch it's been an awesome place to eat.  Joel is what every restaurant should have as part of their team for a successful eatery.  Every year we attend we visited twice this 2017.  Looking forward to my return 2018."}
{"text":"Every trip to Vegas the oysters bar is a must for me, fresh oysters every time. The oysters with cream sauce and wasabi infused caviar are amazing. They open early at 11:30am I usually go for lunch but have been for dinner I've never waited long and the service is always great and friendly"}
{"text":"The food was fantastic. Not pricy at all. You get a lot of food for your money. Smaller than I thought. The only downfall is that it's completely open. You see and hear people walking through the casino. But overall a great establishment. Also great waiters."}
{"text":"I'm sure people walk by and don't give this place a second glance. They are so wrong!!  The horseradish burns your face off in such a good way! Shooters are awesome. We had the cioppino and o.b's pan roast both fantastic!!!   The shooters are big, they will get a good buzz! Carlos was great he was busy but still gave us great service."}
{"text":"This is where you go for a quickie... Oyster fix that is.  We opted to come to this location instead of the 24/7 Palace Station location since we were staying at nearby Flamingo's.  Ordered half dozen of the Rockefeller and the grilled oyster with garlic Parmesan butter, and a dozen of the Oyster Royale which was my favorite.  I prefer the colder preparation vs the baked/hot preparation.  On the Royale, they put creme fraiche and wasabi caviar.  Complimentary dinner roll and crispy bread are nothing to rave about.  Oysters are a good size.  I did get hooked up with an extra large one which was a little challenging to swallow.  A man sitting next to us looked on as I ungracefully chugged the thing down ... Perv!   I  want to give them four stars but the lack of cleanliness is really keeping me from doing so.   Came around 8pm on a Sunday and as we waited for a couple of spots to be \"cleaned\" at the bar, we watched the only bus boy's half ass attempt to knock off pieces of food particles and wipe menus down.  They're just too busy.  There's one waiter who is literally going around in circles doing his best to keep everyone satisfied.  It worked though as we were satisfied nonetheless while that weirdo got a free show."}
{"text":"After spending the morning and part of the afternoon driving to Vegas, it was finally time to relax. Having read reviews of this place here on Yelp, I decided that some oysters would hit the spot, and my boyfriend agreed.  People, you were right! We split a dozen oysters (okay, I ate most of them) and got a couple of glasses of wine. The oysters were big, fresh, delicious, and reasonably priced. And yay for horseradish! The wine was priced a bit higher than in Utah. However, our glasses would have been at least 1.5 glasses in Utah, so it worked out.   The service was quite good, and I enjoyed the relaxed atmosphere of the place. It was great to sit at the bar, relax, and occasionally glance over at the college basketball on the TV.   We seriously considered coming back here a few times during our trip, but we decided that we needed to have some variety. However, I'll definitely be back here next time I'm in Vegas."}
{"text":"The worst place to eat. The steak was burned, the bouillabaisse had no flavor. I will never come back."}
{"text":"So how does this place compare to the much hyped up other Station Casino oyster bar? That's what inquiring Yelpers wanted to know. Well I'm just going to say, \"It's alright!\"....only because I want this ever so delicious dish all to myself. Hah! Seriously though, I was in oyster pan roast heaven after the first spoonful.   This review is solely based on our order for the Signature Pan Roast which had shrimp, crab and lobster.     Broth base - Creamy and perfect amount and blend of seasonings and spices. My friend said she likes this one better over Palace's pan roast because the one here is creamier.   Plump shrimp, good size ones too! Chunks of lobster and crab tasted fresh as well.   The pan roast overall did not have any fishy smell and taste. I did not have any allergy reactions after 24 hours. This was an important factor for me since Im allergic to shell fish. S/O to Dyanna L and her review of this place! I was more at ease when I read that people in her party that  have seafood allergies did fine too.   Portion - huge bowl ..no way I could finish it. So my friend and I ended up splitting one. The now halved portion size was plenty hearty and filling enough for us. The huge bowl is well worth the twenty dollars spent.  We also  had a side green salad which was also plentiful. Oh yeah, our server also brought out a basket of fresh sourdough rolls and flat bread. So our meal was pretty filling.    The Pan Roasts are made to order. You can view the chefs making them either close up front at the oyster bar or sitting at your table/booths surrounding the dining area.   On our visit it was mid afternoon, there was no lines or wait to be seated. The sign at entrance says \"seat yourself\" . It was fairly busy but we found a table easily.   Service - Meets Standards. Acknowledged as soon as we seated ourselves. Drink orders taken right away. Taking our main order took a bit longer than it should though. Had to help ourselves and got our own menus and wait for our server to come around. Once our orders were taken, got our bread and pan roast was served promptly. Got checked up on and drinks refilled when needed.   The Oyster Bar (also formerly known as Costa De Sol)  is open and airy set in a grotto like alcove in Sunset Station. Noise level slightly high. You got the sound from water fountains and the slot machines to deal with. Still beats the smoky filled, small and crowded one over at Palace.   I still have yet to try Palace Station's version but overall consensus the one here is; \"it's as good as it gets!\" So keep going to the hyped up oyster bar in Vegas so that way I can always enjoy pan roast here minus long wait times!"}
{"text":"Everything was amazing. Had a good time with friends before I left on a business trip. Was nice to know that a station casino had this quality of food to offer. I have never had claim chowder that was so flavorful on every level. The amount of fresh sea food in each dish was amazing. I grew up on the ocean have and been all over the country, this was the best representation of Cajun food I have had in a long time. Other then New Orleans of course! Please try this place it's great 4 meals and tip $100.00 out the door, if you ask me great deal for the quality of the meal. Of course being a local and young we where pre-judged by our waiter who didn't have the best attitude or service but the food made up for that. He probably assumed we where some young random tourist customers that where ordering water because the meals were all 20 bucks each. The truth is we all work outside and it was hot as hell yesterday."}
{"text":"Love this place for some fresh oysters and pan roast! I recommend the signature pan roast and the Parmesan garlic oysters. I recently tried the Parmesan garlic oysters which is a new addition to their menu, it's a little pricey but totally worth it. The regular oysters here are always fresh and the pan roast is absolutely delicious. It has a creamy tomato sauce with a side of rice. The signature includes crab, lobster, and shrimp. It does get pretty busy and you have to wait a bit to get seated but it's worth the wait. You can never go wrong with this place."}
{"text":"The food was OK, but not fantastic.  The service was slow, and the smell of cigarettes was pervasive.  With all of the great reviews my expectations were high, but I would be hard pressed to recommend this with all of the other great place to eat in Vegas."}
{"text":"I've been to Sunset Station so many times,  I don't know why I've never tried the Oyster Bar! I'm glad we decided to go because of a $15 dollar coupon  .... My fiance and I will definitely come back again for more seafood adventures!"}
{"text":"Customer service sucks! Sat there 10 minutes, no one greeted us, asked if we wanted water, nothing!!! Your staff appears to be racist.  NEVER FUCKING AGAIN!"}
{"text":"4 STARS?!  ARE YOU KIDDING ME?! I just had what was probably the worst meal in Las Vegas.  Slow was the nicest remark I can make.  The $15 margaritas were a sickening sweet mix served over ice.  The fried calamari had no flavor, the \"risotto\" was inedible.  One does not merely squeeze a few globs of rice into a cream soup and declare it risotto.  The lobster portion had turned--I spit it out, hoping it doesn't make me ill.  The meal was removed from my bill, but I wasn't aiming for a free meal, I wanted a decent meal."}
{"text":"Very yummy! !!!  Service was fast and friendly!  I had the diavolo and my bf had the pan roast... mine was good... wish it was a little more spicy. ... The pan roast was BEYOND YUMMY!!! Wish I would have ordered that!  The price is a little up there but the portion size it good....  will be back!"}
{"text":"My fiancee decided to try this place since my cousin was raving about it. Since we were staying across the street at Caesar's Palace, we decided to take a stroll for a quick bite. Once seated at the bar, it took some time before anyone walking around stopped to give us any attention. We ordered a dozen oysters and the pan roast. The oysters appeared fresh and were nice and cold. The pan roast was ok, not as tasty as the pan roast served at the Oyster Bar at Palace Station. Not sure if service was lagging because we got there about 40 minutes before closing, but the server just didn't seem interested in their job and we ended up giving up on ordering another drink during the meal.  If you're looking for an Oyster Bar, try the one at Palace Station. This one doesn't seem quite up to par."}
{"text":"Super expensive and service very slow.  I'm not a huge oyster fan, so maybe I'm not a great person to review this place.  Lol"}
{"text":"We are from Los Angeles.  We visit our in-laws in Henderson about once or twice a year.  We ALWAYS hit this Oyster Bar when in town.  Yummy!  Great little restaurant."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere.   Food very good.   Wait service not the caliber of Circo, but very good nonetheless!   Food was rushed out even though restaurant was relatively empty. This is the loss of a star.  I like my meals spaced out more!  Calamari was excellent. Not over cooked. Not rubbery.  Our dinners were excellent as well.  My wife's Shrimp scampi was perfectly cooked.  The shrimp were huge, the portions large, and the garlic heavy!  My sausage and chicken was very good as well.  Great flavors and great portion!  Definitely a must, even a return visit!  Forget Circo at Bellaggio, go here and be happy for considerably less!"}
{"text":"I would give this restaurant a 0 star if I can.  The worst restaurant ever.  The service was bad.  The lady in the kitchen doesn't wear gloves at all.  I sat there for 10 minutes watching her dig her long fingernails into all sorts of food, grabbed dirty cash with her hands, and went back to digging into food again.  So disgusting.  Then saw another man put back the leftover sauce into a container that they would later scoop out for the next customers.  I told the manager what I just witnessed and all she could say was: \"I'm sorry, I'll tell the chef about it\"  THAT'S IT !!!  While the manager was talking to me, the lady was still digging her naked hands into the food.  What the Fuck !!!  Nastiest place ever.  This restaurant should be shut down immediately."}
{"text":"It's a four and a half star for me! This place boasts of amazing flavorful and delicious food! Why we never visited sooner is beyond me. This is one of my top places to eat at and bring visiting family for good food.  The only downside that I can say about this place is the way that they seat their guests. We waited in line only to find out that we can just go in and grab a table for our party. We came here tonight to celebrate a birthday for a very good friend and I was getting worried that no one was going to help us. But as soon as we grabbed our table, we were well taken care of by our hostess, Desiree.  We ordered the Pan Roast and let me tell you that I could have bathe in this dish if I could! It was so yummy and the flavor just explodes in your mouth. It's one of my new favorite dishes.  One of the dishes that we tried is the Shrimp and Lobster pasta. That too, gave me the chills! My gosh! The seafood dis not lack. They used fresh ingredients and the abundance of the garnishes were bountiful.  This place is well recommended by me to all! Enjoy!!"}
{"text":"Exceptional Service along with the exceptional food. Oysters were succulent, dinner entree was delicious."}
{"text":"Great oysters.  the prices are reasonable.  we came around 3pm and it was empty.  The waiter was attentive and helpful. The food tasty and fresh.  The Pan Roast was really great.  always good for a meal or snack!"}
{"text":"Absolutely wonderful, fresh seafood, with magnificent service!  King crab legs are huge, I highly recommend!"}
{"text":"I had the lobster roll. It was good. The lobster is cold, a bit of lettuce on the bottom on a buttered roll. When it says buttered, it's buttered, with a side of steak fries. I'd go back, if I had a lot of money. It was $23"}
{"text":"It's just as good as Palace Station without the line!   The service is fantastic, Beau is always full of good recommendations and ideas!   Been eating here once a week since finding this little gem!"}
{"text":"Good food service was fast welcomed us when we came in very friendly atmosphere Allan was very prompt on picking up our plates very friendly too would recommend this place."}
{"text":"I guess the only reason I am not giving them a 5 star is simply because I usually set the bar really high, so a 4 star from me means definitely worth a try!  We ordered a dozen oyster(half fresh and half fried), they tasted so good and fresh(my stomach didn't complain what's so ever). They gave us three types of sauces for fresh oyster-- cocktail, horseradish, and ranch.( they also provide tobasco)  I ordered sauteed clam pasta with white sauce. Not only it tasted good, they gave me lots of clams--Seriously-- I think I probably got 25+ or so  clams, and they gave me another big bowl for shells.  My friend ordered seafood risotto which was filled with clams, mussel jumbo shrimp and even real lobster! They don't use strong wines like many Italian places in Cali do, instead it has stronger flavor of tomato sauce.  As of price, I think it is very subjective. Some might feel it dirty cheap, some might feel the opposite. My opinion is, given the quality and the service( the guy who gave us service that night was extremely friendly and helpful), it is definitely not pricy. Most of their dishes are priced like many mid-level Italian restaurants in Cali, but they have a better quality!"}
{"text":"I've never had a lobster roll until I came here on Sat! Liz and the chef gave my bf and I such amazing and comfortable service!  So accommodating and the food was delicious! I'm craving their salt and pepper chips and oysters again!   Definitely would come back when we come back to LV!!"}
{"text":"Had the House special pan roast- which has lobster, crab and shrimp in a creamy bisque. If you have not tried this yet- you have no idea what you are missing! This dish is delicious and very filling. I shared the dish with my husband. I ordered the dish medium spicy. Enjoyed watching the chefs make the dish in front of us. The service was excellent. Definitely recommend - 5+Stars!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"5 stars for consistency. We came back here 3 times while staying at Harrah's, and half the point of my trip was to try as many restaurants as possible...so that says something!  Our first trip in was a slow spot in the day and the bar is off to the side of the casino in a corner. Worried me a little, but the calamari was a huge portion size and amazing.  The bar picks up at night and the atmosphere was much better. This time we tried the crab cakes and clam chowder. Both fantastic and tasted very fresh. My mom has an unusual fascination with clam chowder and she had to get another bowl the next day.  The last time we got a recommendation from a couple to get the grilled oysters. WIN. Get the grilled oysters.  I don't mind Vegas prices....these are getting towards the high side but we are coming back to Harrah's oyster bar next trip, no doubt about it."}
{"text":"Great place-we love to go here. if you like oysters and cajun pasta/seafood and great drinks this is the place. Casual and hectic at times but food is consistent and staff very nice. Most of the staff has been there for years and they cook the meals right in front of you. Can get hectic and loud at times but staff handles it well."}
{"text":"Wow this pace was amazing from appetizers to baked clams.  Clam chowder was one of best I've had and so were the crab legs.  Eat at the bar to get the full experience."}
{"text":"Chef Chad and his team at the Oyster Bar are phenomenal! I had the crab cakes, calamari fries and the shrimp and grits. Let me tell you....this is the best meal I have had in a very long time!!! The food is fresh, delicious and I can see why Chef Chad heads the Oyster Bar as he is an incredible, talented chef! I even had their version of the popular cocktail moscow mule. Fantastic! I am telling everyone to try this Oyster Bar out before they have lines out the door! Don't waste your time at these other second rate Oyster Bars around Vegas....Hard Rock Hotel is right on the money...and seafood!"}
{"text":"The food was absolutely delicious but the service was the worst service I have ever received. Kevin behind the bar is a total dick. How he has kept his job is beyond me. This was our first visit here and he spoke to us as if we should know they didn't have Crab legs. He ignored us the entire meal after he took our order and didn't bring us water or ask if we wanted another drink my boyfriend ate his whole meal with no drink. He never asked if we are ok the entire meal and after we were finished he didn't even bring our check we had to ask another server for our check. My boyfriend and I were ready to walk out. It was pretty awful and sad cause the food was so good and it could've been great. We would love to go back to eat again but too bad such a douchbag can ruin it. All the other servers and bussers were very friendly though. You should definitely go if you've never been but stay clear of him for sure."}
{"text":"We came for dinner on a Wednesday right before 7pm and there was seating for us despite the bar looking quite full. Server greeted us promptly and served our drinks along with complimentary chips right away.   You'll notice the rack of condiments filled with an assortment of hot sauces on the bar table as you wait.   We decided on the All In pan roast, lobster roll and corn chowder.  The food arrived at our table in this order: pan roast first, lobster roll next and the chowder last. It should have been the other way around lol.. It's the exact order we ordered it but we just found it weird how the order of what 'should' come first to last was reversed.   As for the food, the pan roast was not piping hot. It came with rice on the side that tasted somewhat dry. The amount of rice didn't seem adequate enough for the serving of pan roast; it's like an ice cream soup sized serving. There was plenty of crab meat dispersed in the tomato based cream, two pieces of colosso shrimp and clumps of shelled lobster meat. The lobster meat was SO overcooked, it was rubbery, literally. We didn't finish this dish but we didn't feel it was worth taking the leftovers home.  The lobster roll was quite good. Note that it is COLD lobster salad on top which was refreshing. We've always had warm or hot lobster filling in the past and being made cold was something different that we actually preferred it made this way. There wasn't too much mayo dressing either. The lobster was just a tad over cooked but not to the point of being rubbery. The bread itself was grilled outside nicely and soft inside. It came with a side of steak fries. This was the highlight of our meal.  The cup of corn chowder was a little off putting for my bf from the extra virgin olive oil drizzled on the top but I was just okay with it. It had chunks of potatoes, wasn't too salty and was very thick and creamy. It was definitely heavy towards the end of our meal.  We may be back to try other items and get the lobster roll again. The pan roast was just alright to us that we wouldn't crave it again. The wait is better than other oyster bars for sure."}
{"text":"We took the GF's dad (and his Diamond Player's card) to this place for some quick grub since the bar at Harrah's Rincon was delicious.  It's probably the best thing I did that weekend.  They have a good selection of oysters, soup, and pastas.  Personally, I didn't care much for anything but the oysters, so I vaguely remember what I ate.  It pretty much left me speechless.  My recommendation?....check it out for yourself.  Thank me later."}
{"text":"I had to give this place 5 stars because it's such a great value for Vegas.  After a brief search on Yelp for an inexpensive seafood spot, Penazzi's was the overwhelming winner.  So once we got to Vegas and checked into our hotel, we headed down to Harrah's and plopped ourselves at the bar here.  The only time I've had raw oysters before was a couple shooters at the Acme Oyster House in New Orleans a long time ago, and even that had tabasco sauce and alcohol or something in it...so basically I had never had raw oysters because they skeeved me out a little bit.  I like mussels ok but I've always found clams to be too sea-water-tasting, and that's what I expected oysters to taste like too.  Well not these!! We ordered a half dozen raw and a half dozen fried oysters and they were as fresh as could be, and not ocean-y at all!!  In fact, I liked the raw oysters BETTER than the fried ones, because they were just so darn refreshing.  The fried oysters were serious though, because they were WHOLE--not the pieces you sometimes get at seafood restaurants.  When you bite into them, oyster juices go everywhere.    We were pretty hungry so we also ordered a bowl of lobster bisque and the linguini fra diavolo with mussels.  The bisque was pretty gross in my opinion, but they sure weren't skimpy with the mussels!!!  It was good, but pretty spicy.  The raw oysters were the clear winner of the evening.  This place isn't cheap by any other city's standards but it really is a pretty good deal in Vegas--I highly recommend you check it out!!"}
{"text":"This is my favorite Vegas spot that not many people know about. The food is excellent.  Fresh, light, and made right in front of you. The oysters are fresh and tasty and I recommend the fish tacos, cioppino, both clam chowders, and the crabcakes. But the real charm here is the amazing staff. The same folks have been there for years and the recognize us when we come back, even after a year. Treat them right and they will be exceptionally nice. Last year we got a free risotto sample and this year it was shrimp ceviche and some soup.  Prices are reasonable for Vegas and service is prompt and friendly. A great place for lunch and worth a walk."}
{"text":"What the hell? This was my second meal of my trip and i am starting to have faith in hotel/casino restaurants. I had the gumbo while my friend has the etoufee. Rich flavors in my gumbo, great level of spice and i could even do it spicier but I'll let the chef choose what he feels is right. the richness as it coated my mouth with the beautiful flavors of seafood was a great way to get my eyes rolling backward in Ecstasy. this will have to be a usual spot for me to return to because even right now I'm craving some gumbo."}
{"text":"We had a really nice server/cook.  Raymundo made us seafood risotto with lobster, clams, mussels, shrimp, and bay scallops.  I was expecting a cream sauce but it was mostly butter and seafood broth, which wasn't bad.  The rice was cooked perfectly.  We also had crab cakes with aioli and they came two to an order.  The exterior could have been more crisp, but it was delicious nonetheless.  We had a few glasses of champagne to complete our meal.  3.5 stars"}
{"text":"Was having oyster cravings so I checked my yelp for nearest oyster bars read reviews and decided to try O'Hara oyster bar . Oh my gosh ,sat right at the bar the waiter was very friendly his name was Dennis we order half dozen to start I had a drity Marty husband had cranberry vodka fast service. Oysters were amazing I was very happy. We had half dozen more lol . I'm addicted to oysters. Then we ordered the ribeye. Let me tell u! Every bite I moaned !melts in your mouth flavors dancing on my tongue. We will  be coming back soon."}
{"text":"This one is a lil different from the one at Palace Station menu wise, but just as good. No long line wait either. Once again I had the oyster rockefeller...just get them nuff said. Oyster shooters were good too....next time I will get them spicy!! Sat at the bar and was able to see all items being brought out. The grilled steak \"Oscar style\" with crab on top looked  delicious!"}
{"text":"Returned to LV and remembered how great the oysters were served.  Nearing my final day, I was finally able to drop one evening before a show.  I had been eating light all day and decided to spring for a dozen of their Jumbo Fried Oysters which were perfectly cooked.  The Seafood Risotto was also very well done.  We topped the evening off with 2 Ride Tide drinks.  Even though they were pretty busy, our server James kept us covered and my water glass filled.  Bravo."}
{"text":"Questions  Is bread best when it has the fragrance of yeast rather than cardboard?  Is New England clam chowder supposed to be cream-colored rather than gray?  Are sushi rolls supposed to taste more like fish than cucumber? Is sushi rice supposed to be flavored with rice wine vinegar? Is  eel best when it tastes like eel rather than candy?  Is tuna supposed to be free of sinew threads that feel like thin dental floss?  If your answer to any of the above is yes, then go somewhere else.  Grocery store deli sushi and canned chowder are better.  Seriously.    ....and while I'm at it... What is it about Las Vegas bakers and bread?  When you get bread here your response is usually \"Oh, it has that on it.\" or \"It has this on it\", or \"I don't know what that is.\"  I got a suggestion: Buy  Walmart frozen east rolls.  Follow the directions, and your patrons will roll their eyes so only the whites show and bury their faces in the bread basket.  Taste is better than how clever you are."}
{"text":"A lot of people go to Vegas for the buffets. After dining here, screw the buffets!  This was hands down, the best restaurant my lovely friends and I ate at during the fun weekend.  I felt as though you cannot go wrong with any food items you choose.  Each dish comes with a special sauce (I am a sauce man) that just enhances every flavor you get.  The panroast was amazing.  The shrimp was huge (Good idea to dip it in the panroast sauce since the shrimp can be a little dry)!  The oysters were sized right (Careful on the wasabi-like dip).  What really did me in was the seafood risotto.  I do not usually prefer risotto, but they definitely did something with this dish that got me hooked.  The texture was perfect, the sauce was perfect, everything was just so delicious.  Each bite was something to savor, being drunk or not."}
{"text":"The Pan Roast at the O.B. at Harrah's wasn't satisfying. You couldn't choose the amount of spicyness and it was strangely sweet?!? Although you can just walk in it isn't the same as the O.B. at Palace Station. It's better at Palace Station b/c you can choose the amount of heat(spice) and at P.S. the seafood is already shelled at Harrah's you have to do it by yourself which is annoying."}
{"text":"Great seafood, quick seating. Recommend the grilled oysters and Cajun Scallops - which had a unique Italian twist in the sauce and noodles. Not to mention reasonable considering today's Vegas high food prices."}
{"text":"Agreed with Mona C. about the whole \"good but not great oysters cant be beat with a price like that but then again cant argue with a price like that\"  Just want to add that the clam chowder seriously tasted like it was canned.   I ordered a sampler, mostly everything was deep fried i would expect a place like an oyster bar to find ways to enhance the flavors of seafood not just batter and fry the suckers. Surprisingly the rice was good.   NOT GOOD for groups, seating is VERY limited"}
{"text":"The wait was horrible. Customer service needs improvement. The hotel is run down. The food was awesome. If you need a great meal but don't have 1.5 hours to wait go somewhere else. Portions are big. Very filling."}
{"text":"Terrible oyster, shucking service (little shells in the oysters), and oysters not even removed from their muscle.    Clam chowder and crab cakes avg."}
{"text":"I will take a pass on this next time. They were out of shrimp, crab cakes, other oyster dishes. and NO sushi! What a waste of time and money!"}
{"text":"Needed to get my seafood fix.  Stopped at the Oyster Bar and was pleasantly surprised. Ate at the bar and the staff was very friendly, excellent service and great food.  I had the pan roast and thought the flavor and portion was great!"}
{"text":"NOT THE SAME AS PALACE STATION!  The hubby and I were super excited to see another Oyster Bar, but please note this is not the same as the one at Palace Station.  However, that said, the Clam Chowder here was excellent. Their version of the Pan Roast was lacking in flavor but on the bright side the large chunks of fresh seafood made up for that in some ways. The sauce is a sweeter than what we would have liked and reminded me a bit of BBQ sauce but overall we had a great experience."}
{"text":"I really enjoyed my first time here.  The atmosphere is almost pure brilliance, with small waterfalls surrounding the cave exterior that you can enjoy while you eat at the simple white table clothed seating areas.    While it is located within Sunset Station casino, you don't feel like you're just shoved into the corner of a smokey casino.  This place does a great job of making you feel like you are at a restaurant all of it's own.  Friendly service, and just great food.  I'd highly recommend ordering the pan roast, it's well worth the price.  Great undeniable flavor and its very filling.  The chefs also make the food right in plain view at the bar, where there is also seating.  Take yourself a date, enjoy the candle light and waterfalls, and have a great night at dinner."}
{"text":"I was a little weary of this place as it's a chain and just a small place in the middle of the casino / open to the casino floor. But it was great! We were just hunting for a snack, so we only got a 1/2 dozen of grilled oysters. But the menu had me salivating and already planning a return visit. From clams and mussels to king crab legs and shrimp, all your seafood needs can be met here. They also have a ribeye, salads, etc. We opted to sit at the bar. It's an open prep bar with several stools, and then there's a few tables around it. It was fun to be able to watch everything being prepared, oysters being shucked, etc. And the service was very friendly and attentive. The grilled oysters were crazy delicious. And excellent mix of flavors. This will be my go-to oyster prep from now on. They also have a decent list of cocktails and wines. And the prices are quite reasonable. We will most definitely be back (and soon)."}
{"text":"I'm an oyster bar connoisseur, but tonight I'm extremely displeased. I sat at the Bar to order take out. Before Sandra even knows that... she didn't offer water, a choice beverage or bread. We sat waiting for our food in a great ambiance twiddling our thumbs. Customer service was at an all time LOW. Keith the Chef was more attentive to customers than the actual servers."}
{"text":"Can we say YUM? The last time I was in Vegas, (last year), a bunch of my friends went to the Oyster Bar inside Harrah's, while myself and others went to the pool. They were talking about the oyster bar for days after. So this time, I had to go.  I went with my BF and another couple in the middle of the day on a Saturday. Not busy at all. We sat ourselves, and look @ the menu/place mat. We ordered 2 dozen raw oysters, (20/dozen), 2 bowls of clam chowder (6/bowl?), and an order of Manila Clam Steamers in the White Broth (18/order), and I ordered a Mai Tai, which wasn't very strong at all and was $10. (I have no tolerance, so if I say a drink isn't strong.. it's NOT)  The oysters were good, a little larger than I'm used to, but good. They were served with lemon juice, cocktail sauce, and horseradish. We asked for additional tabasco sauce. The clam chowder was delicious. A little thicker than I'd prefer, but good. The clams were my favorite. The clams were small-ish, but the broth was so, so, sooo good. We soaked up our bread and devoured it. I was sad when our waitress took it away. Which by the way, our waitress, Angie, was super nice and super friendly. Loved her.  So going back next time."}
{"text":"This is a must stop for me and my wife. We don't even have to look at the menu dozen oysters and two fish tacos excellent. Sometimes they do have small oysters but we said something to them and they threw in a couple more. Go to the bar next door and pick up a couple bud light red beers in a 24 oz can prior to going.

{"text":"The items that I had here were delicious, and while sitting at the bar I had impeccable service. I had the bacon wrapped scallops and shrimp, a bowl of clam chowder, and an unsweetened iced tea. I was offered a bread basket with mixed bread with my meal."}
{"text":"I spent $20 and enjoyed a 1/2 dozen of regular oysters and a 1/2 dozen of charbroiled oysters. I call that a great deal. It'a a nice and clean space. I opted to sit at the bar so you can watch everything being made. The staff were pleasant and attentive. The menu was somewhat simple, but had enough options to please most everyone. The charbroiled oysters were so yum! The wine and beer list is alright. It was a cheap (to me, for oysters) and pleasant dining experience. I will most definitely come back."}
{"text":"The server/ oyster shucker seemed annoyed to be disturbed from his sports game on TV by me ordering or requesting items like napkins, silverware, water, or the check. Come to think of it the guy needed prompting the whole time! For food that ain't cheap this kind of service is cray... Especially with the wealth of good dining options in Vegas. Run away from this place. They suck! My bacon-wrapped scallops were gross- covered in BBQ and the white fatty part of bacon, not the standard solid minutely fatty looking pieces real restaurants serve.   I love seafood whether it be fine dining or dive style. This place sucked by all standards and the service was exceptionally poor."}

The food was okay way not worth what you pay for it...  2nd time they were fully packed and only ONE freaking waiter for the whole bar area...and one drink server?  Anyhow they really are mismanaged as a restaurant especially for understaffing during trade show weeks....It took forever to flag the waiter down...get extra drinks and even to put in our order...the food took forever and my boss ordered a Medium Rare steak that came out not just well done but somewhat charred!  How can they even pass that off to a customer I'm not sure?!?!?!?!  Definitely should receive less than 1 star!"}
{"text":"Everything was just awesome, but my guest and I were seating at the bar table, and the service at the Bar table wasn't there. Next time, I will just seat at the table.  Food: Good Price: Good Service: Okay Parking: Good"}
{"text":"A little gem tucked away in the middle of Harrah's. The clam chowder is delicious. The oysters always great! Don't miss it!!"}
{"text":"Went outside my comfort zone and ordered bbq oysters and the Rockefeller oysters...both awesome but favored the bbq ones.. calamari was good not chewy.....my waiter was an older gentleman(James) and he was awesome also...most definitly coming back... ***!!!!!!! They took the Bbq oysters off the menu :("}
{"text":"The only reason I gave it a 2 was because I enjoyed the oysters and meal but man service was awful.  First we had to sit ourselves  which OK maybe it's early and they don't have a hostess at around 2pm. One person took our drink order and another took our food order, and it came out fairly good time. That was the last time we saw someone come to our table, no one came to refill our drinks or asked us if we wanted more mixed drinks and we were willing to get more and they weren't cheap. After we were done my wife and sister got tired of waiting for our check so I told them to go to casino and kill some time and I will wait, well after 10 mins someone finally asked if I needed anything and I said yes my check please, well it took another 10 min before I even got it. During that time never did anyone apologized for the wait even after I told the person who finally got my check which was not even the original guy who helped us. We could of walked out   skipping out on the bill, and it was possible because no one was around us to serve us, but I'm a good person and paid my $113 bill. I'm a very patient person but I would like someone to contact me because I've been in the  customer service industry since I was 15 and I've never giving or received this kind of service before."}
{"text":"It was great going down...but I got really sick afterwards. I don't know why. It was my first meal in Vegas too. So is set the tone for my trip and it was unfortunate when it came to food. I'm someone who has been visiting oyster bars lately for baked oysters and usually enjoy it. I'm not allergic or didn't get sick in the other where I visited oyster bars so I'm not really sure what was the issue here. The only thing I could think of was I usually get my oysters baked and I'm not 100% sure these were not baked. But then again I don't exactly remember what I ordered other than oysters themselves.   I will say that the staff was super attentive and super nice. None of this changes the fact that I got sick. That's why this review is \"just okay\"."}
{"text":"Really fresh oysters! They're medium sized, while I've always preferred small ones, but there were so fresh and delicious, I loved them anyway. I followed the reviews on Yelp and ordered the O.B.'s Pan Roast... The smoked tomato cream sauce was so amazing, I wanted to sop up every bit of it. Instead, I took whatever I couldn't eat with me to finish later."}
{"text":"Love the food. Small selection but everything is fresh. I highly recommend clam chowder and etoufee. Excellent food but mediocre service. Takes forever to get a server's attention if you can even find one. Sometimes it's better when you're able to get a car seat but it runs the cooks ragged to have to cook and be servers too."}
{"text":"Everything we tried are great. Fresh seafood are prepared perfectly. Definitely recommend their calamari, oysters and shrimp scampi. Love the casual open bar setting."}
{"text":"I would never go back here after seeing the poor sanitation standards they have. As I was having dinner, I was watching the buser clear out dirty dishes and glasses.  He was using his bare hands holding the used glasses from the inner rim and was also touching the used plates. After doing so, he didn't wash his dirty hands and touched clean silverware and set them for the next diner. I was disgusted seeing that and didn't even bother finishing my food. I'm sure if the GM reads this, he'll know exactly who this is because I mentioned this to him."}
{"text":"Great fresh and affordable its in the back of the casino.  We had oyster rockefeller and Cesar salads they were great and affordable.  The chowder looked great also but I was too full to order some.  Will eat there next time I'm in town for sure!"}
{"text":"This is my third time here and they never fail me with their tomahawk steak! It's not on the menu but they always accommodate me when requested. Amazing service and food!!"}
{"text":"This place is gross. Should have known since it was at Harrahs. Shrimp scampi is crappy pasta with 3 shrimp.  Sent it back. Considering quality. EVERYTHING is way overpriced even for Vegas.   I would go elsewhere."}
{"text":"I am so in love with this place!! If you're near Harrahs and in the mood for some amazing seafood then I highly recommend this place. Every main entrée is about $35, but definitely worth it. WARNING: every entree is way too much for just one person.  The place is super easy to find, its located near the Flavors buffet in Harrahs (near the McDonalds/Chipotle entrance). I came here around 8pm on a Saturday with 4 others, we were seated very quickly. The restaurant can seat about 60 people, but they seemed a little short on staff that night. The menu is smaller than most restaurants which is nice because everything on the menu is hard enough to choose from. I was torn between the New England Steamer and the Seafood Risotto, the risotto won. Luckily, someone in my party got the steamer, and they were both amazing and huge! They were both filled with clams, mussels, baby scallops, giant shrimp and half a lobster tail. I've never been to a seafood restaurant that had such big portions. The only tiny thing I did not like was that some of the clams were a little sandy. The other people in my party ordered the Fish and Chips, Jambalaya with Chicken and Clam pasta. The Fish & Chips and Jambalaya didn't seem like anything special, but the clam pasta was nicely overloaded with clams.  So please give this place a try and try the risotto or steamer.  I for sure can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"Oyster Bar is located at Harrah's Casino.. Not to be mistaken with the Palace Station location which my opinion is way better than this location.   I was hoping for that spicy tomato broth bouillabaisse, however, the version at this Oyster Bar location is a clear seafood saffron broth. The soup it self is okay and lacks flavor and spice. It's filled with sautéed shrimp, scallops, lobster, mussels, clams, crab claws and fish. Seafood itself is good and enjoyable especially with that 1/2 lobster tail but the broth I didn't care for.   Service here was just okay. Waitress was nice and attentive. The hostess was a bit annoying. We arrived and she was fixing the sign up front and ignoring the fact we where standing next to her for a few minutes. She really wanted to finish up fixing a sign that could of waited to be fixed after we would be seated. Keep in mind, the restaurant seats were mostly empty.   Nothing beats the Palace Station location.."}
{"text":"My dad and I will always stop here on any trip to Las Vegas! The food, the service, and the atmosphere make this a must stop for any seafood lover! We alway split the platter which comes decadently put together. It's plenty of food for two or three with all the seafood fixings. We've also tried their crab cakes and of course a few of their unique oyster dishes. There's only a few menu options for the average carnivore, but when you're here you'll want to expand your food palette and try something new. This would be the place to make your tastebuds happy. Oh and say hi to Ly! Let him know Marvin and Alicia from Iowa sent you!"}
{"text":"Always great!   As long as you don't have a large party (more than 4) and don't mind waiting for a table, this place is the best.  My family loves the clam chowder, charbroiled oysters and the gumbo.   The staff is always super friendly."}
{"text":"Terrible service!!!  Food was good but not super great and unfortunately my husband received his almost 15 minutes before I received mine. He never got water even asking for it several times. The waiter did offered to reheat his dinner but at this point we just wanted to leave."}
{"text":"Haven't been here since 2012 and it was just as good as I remembered! We ordered the OB's Pan Roast, jumbo prawns, and oysters! Excellent customer service, food was quick, fresh seafood! If you sit at the bat they make it right in front of you! One of my favorite places to eat in Vegas!"}
{"text":"My husband and I had visited your establishment on Nov. 18. I would just like to Thank our server \"Beau\" our wonderful Server,  Si Cook, RJ, Darrell and Jesus...... We frequently visit The Oyster Bar and all my Husband will ever eat is the Bouillabasse !!!!! Everyone who took care of us was very knowledgeable about the menu and we absolutely enjoy watching every employee       work together as a team... KUDOS TO ALL OF YOU. Deafinately will return with new friends and extended family....  Keep up the Good work.."}
{"text":"Great service, great oysters.  We had the grilled oysters, oyster shooters and lobster bisque.  All delicious.  We would definitely go back."}
{"text":"Although with an unassuming name, Oyster Bar has some solid seafood and food in general.   Sashimi/Oysters: Everything was really fresh. Oysters are the only things I refuse to eat, but everyone in my family loved them!   Rolls: Solid and tasty!   Entrees: The pan roast and gumbo was great! Both were greatly seasoned and the seafood was still fresh and tasty! The linguine, however, definitely needed more work and seasoning.   Service: It was SO SLOW. I understand because there was only one server, but it took quite a while to order and receive our food."}
{"text":"Juicy Oysters and Oyster shooters!!  Service here is awesome!! Everyone is so friendly and nice, especially an asian guy named Ly. He gives wonderful service to every single customer. Having excellent attentive service makes the dining a much better experience for all.   Must try the oyster shooter with I believe it's called Asian Bomb alcohol which is a mixture of sake and some other stuff which makes it taste so unique. It is soooo good!!! It will kick your butt without the alcohol taste. It's 3 for $12 I think but it's so worth it!!!   Oysters are fresh and delicious!! There's different kinds of oysters which Ly explained to us. I can't remember it of course, but there's a Japanese one and a southern one and blablabla. I tasted 2 different kinds and they were sooo good!! I love how it's already cut from the shell and ready to slurp. A must try!!!  Also tried seafood cioppino, shrimp appetizer, and steamed mussels. They were all very delicious as well. The shrimps are big here so it was really good. They put in some salsa-ish taste to the mussels while being steamed which makes it very juicy.   Great place to eat in Vegas if you're sick of the buffets. Definitely a must try in Vegas. The only problem you'll have is the price, but that's at any juicy oyster bar."}
{"text":"The Signature (Shrimp, Crap & Lobster) Pan Roast was the best thing I've ever put in my mouth! Our chef/server, Beau, was awesome. His recommendations were dead on. He even gave me the tip to mix both Manhattan and New England clam chowder together, because I can never decide... mind blown! Complete game changer. I love the decor of the restaurant, but it's the service and delicious food that will keep me coming back over and over."}
{"text":"This place had the worst oysters I have ever eaten. We decided to check out this oyster bar because they had a dozen oysters for $15 and it was a casino too. We wanted to get off The Strip and try a locals place. The place is in the back of the casino and their prices certainly do not reflect their restaurant's atmosphere. When they oysters arrived they immediately smelled, almost like the smell of fishy water. Once we tasted them (there were four of us), none of us said anything to each other, but all made faces. They were bland and tasted like lake water. We dumped salt on them, hoping that would make them more edible, it did not. We only ate half of them. My buddy ordered the BOUILLABAISSE and really liked it. He offered it to the rest of us, but after you have a taste of bad oysters in your mouth- nothing sounds good anymore. The bread they bring to your table reminded me of the bread served at a prepackaged all you can eat buffet like Old Town Buffet or Golden Corral. We won't be back. Also, their wine is pricey judging by the atmosphere. It really feels like your in the back room of the casino and not a restaurant."}
{"text":"I love food and I've been around the world and pretty much tasted everything everywhere...... this place is by far the best seafood restaurant I've been too..... their clam chowder is second to none... their oysters and crab legs are top notch .... well to sum it up, if your thinking about coming here, stop thinking."}
{"text":"It's not often an individual would drive four and a half hours for a bowl of something fabby but this is the case folks. The pan roast is redonkulous. If I were condemned to death this would be my last supper. My poor husband is getting burned out as I make him share one with me but feels that it is overkill to have it for breakfast, lunch, and dinner. Picky, picky.  I hesitate to review this as it might result in a horde of avid Yelpers converging on the Oyster Bar and thereby making me have to wait for this precious bounty. But, review I must as it is so deserving of the high praise it so deserves. Yes, I be the wizard of words, anointing my beloved pan roast with the title, \"nectar of the gods\". So come and enjoy I promise you will not be disappointed as it is replete with lobster, shrimp and bathed in a spicy broth of tomatoey marvelousness.   Pan roast I salute you as you make this world a better place."}
{"text":"Love this oyster bar location at Harrah's.  Their raw oysters are always very fresh and I've tried them fresh, fried, and grilled.  My favorite is their oyster raw, and they always have different varieties based on availability. I highly suggest the pan roast with pasta and their king crab legs.  Their calamari and French fries are also really crispy and served piping hot. Everything else is delicious too and seafood is cooked to perfection. We've also tried the bouillabaisse, clam chowder, pan seared Scottish salmon, fish tacos, seafood risotto, and sautéed clams in white sauce."}
{"text":"Okay I've been here numerous times before always for oysters but we went the past weekend for the pan roast and it was two thumbs down. The broth was sweet for some reason and just not good. Go for the oysters but that's all."}
{"text":"Oyster Bar is great!   1. The look and design of the layout is clean and welcoming with a TV right in the middle so you can watch whatever game catches your fancy.  2. The server Jade was FANTASTIC! She was hustling and had all the seats under her belt with no unhappy customers. She's also very personable which is sometimes hard to find.   3. The chips that they give you when you sit down were a bit salty but I think that's probably because I don't drink. I'm sure if I did the chips would be the perfect amount of salty.   The old man ordered the Crab Cakes and the Po Boy and he said they were delicious. They must have been because they were gone in a heartbeat.   I ordered a dozen Kumamoto oysters (my favorite) and they were SUPER fresh and ultra delicious! Yum! I could sit there all day and eat oysters. Even writing about it now makes me want to go back downstairs and have another dozen.  I also ordered the corn chowder but it wasn't my absolute favorite. Maybe it just didn't compare to the oysters or I had too much brininess from the oysters to really appreciate the flavors.   But overall I had a great time, great food at an affordable price while I watched UK beat Wichita State."}
{"text":"So ate here today thinking it was the same or almost as close as the oyster bar at palace station :( I am so highly disappointed! Got the ob house pan roast and yuck yuck yuck! Never again! I will wait the hour to two hours at palace station next time! Booooo!!! Two thumbs down!!!"}
{"text":"Chef Chads recipes will not disappoint. He will even adjust to your personal taste. Tried the shrimp and grits, steamed clams were awesome, ahi tacos to die for, and the servers are so friendly. Next to try the cioppino and spicy!"}
{"text":"I had the crab salad and it was delicious! I know, I know....why did I go to the Oyster Bar and order crab salad? Well, I don't like oysters and I went because it was my friend's birthday and that is where he wanted to go. Anyway, the staff was friendly, the food was good and the price was decent! I recommend that everyone tries the Oyster Bar!!"}
{"text":"Everything you expect at a great restaurant found in such a small place; inside a hotel too!  The food: We had the oysters, the clam chowder, and the rib eye the four times we came here.  First of all, the clam chowder is the best I have ever eaten!  I absolutely LOVE clam chowder and eating it here delighted my taste buds so much that my mouth almost leaped for joy that first taste.  In my humble opinion, the rib eye steak here has got to be the best steak in Vegas.  Eating at other places, we thought it was really salty.  Personally, I think they go a bit overboard with their spices, but here, it was simply amazing to see that this place advertises oysters and yet, their steak is the best in Vegas!  Very funny in a sense.  Now, the oysters!  The oysters taste great, very fresh, and worth the price.  One time, they had special oysters flown in from Japan.  Six dollars more for a dozen, but my goodness, worth the price!  Once you put them in your mouth, they just melted; leaving your mouth in such ecstasy; that you wonder how you have ever lived without tasting such great food.  The one thing I do not suggest are their Bloody Marys.  I thought it was way too salty and they should balance how much vodka they use.  It overpowered the tomato juice and accentuated on the saltiness rather than a little bit of both spiciness from the Tabasco and the complimentary taste of the tomatoes.  The service: Every time we came here, the service was excellent.  We never waited too long with the food, and every few minutes the waiter would tell us about how the food was coming along.  Plus the kitchen is not too far from view so you could see if they were lying or not.  They appeased our cravings by giving us what we needed with our food.  Everyone was always smiling which made this place so inviting.    This place should be bigger and more advertised, and has become one of our go to places when we come to Vegas.  With superb service and food, this restaurant is one of our Vegas trip highlights when thinking about food.  Happy yelping."}
{"text":"I love this place! I still haven't been to the one at Palace Station but I can't even imagine it tasting much better. The food here is off the hook!! Bursting with flavor!!"}
{"text":"This is a favorite of my dad's. I think we come at least once when we make a Woo family trip. Relatively inexpensive compared to most seafood joints on the Strip, Oyster Bar at the Harrah's offers decent food in a bar like atmosphere. It's literally a circular shaped establishment. A bar with seats around it and a few belly tables surrounds the outer corners. There isn't much walking space at all.  Forget about the salads and the entrees! I think the calamari is the best darn thing on the menu. The batter is super flavorful so you don't really need to use the dipping sauce. All you need is a squirt of citrus-yum, my mouth is salivating at the thought of it! Since it's an Oyster Bar, def try something in their Oyster section. For those who don't like raw seafood,  I highly recommend the Bouillabaisse and Cioppino. My mom likes those two dishes a lot."}
{"text":"Everything was really good ! I definitely recommend palace station better. But I will definitely come back.."}
{"text":"I try to visit anytime I am in Vegas. They have some of the belts and freshest food around. I can never eat all my food."}
{"text":"I give this place 5 stars for three reasons First I love the food, especially the oysters and the crab pan roast.  It is rich and sumptuous.  When I eat it I feel like I'm at the beach but eating outside next to the boardwalk, people watching.    Second I absolutely love the ambiance.  It's small quaint and cozy.  Always feel good while I enjoy my food here.  Third, this might be weird, but I love still being apart of the casino while I eat.  As u eat here u can see and hear and smell the casino.  And as I lived here a few years in my younger days, it brings back childhood memories.    I love Vegas and I love this little establishment."}
{"text":"My guy and I had a great experience here.  It's a small restaurant but I liked the atmosphere.  We sat next to the waterfalls and I loved the sounds.  The waitress Oliva was a gem.  Very attentive without being overbearing and she was relaxed and friendly.  One of the chefs (I think his name was Andrew) came out and brought us two gigantic chocolate dipped strawberries at no charge.  Said he was experimenting with them and might put them on the menu.  He chatted with us for a bit.  Nice guy!  I read that someone complained about the rolls but I thought they were excellent.  Had a sourdough flavor and were just chewy enough.  I had the salmon and it was exceptional.  It believe it was poached and was served with rice (good) in a bowl with some broth in the bottowm.  The fish was melt in your mouth good.  The portion was large.  I couldn't finish it all.  My guy had the cioppino and really enjoyed ti.  We live on the other side of town but I do believe we'll be wandering back there some day."}
{"text":"Great little place.  Fast service and the food wasn't that bad or bland.  Half of the group ordered the $15 special (smaller portions, but there was a salad).    There was free bread, and lots of it which helped some of us fill up due to the smaller portions, although some were still left hungry.    Service was fast.  Table for 10 was ready in a minute."}
{"text":"The pan roast is not like palace station's at all.  Considering the price you would think the seafood would be shelled. It's not."}
{"text":"Love this place!  Everything from the food you get to the service you receive is top notch.  Can't really tell you what dish is my favorite as I have tried most and they are all my favorite when I am done with that one.  The only meal I had that was a little different was the shrimp.  They didn't come as I thought they were but they were still awesome.  Usually a weekly stop for us."}
{"text":"Awesome meal! Ordered the cioppino and Chef Raymundo asked if we wanted a little spice added. It was perfect! Not too spicy, just enough to bring the broth up a notch. Very attentive servers and well worth the money. Full of perfectly cooked seafood. Would definitely return when in Vegas."}
{"text":"My friend and I stayed at The Mirage hotel for EDC and decided to get dinner since our other friends arrived way later. We're seafood people, we love seafood.   Upon getting seated at the bar, we looked at the menu and was surprised at the prices. But what the hell, we're here to have a good time so let's hope that this is worth the money.   Ohhhh yeah it was. We ordered a dozen of oysters  for $28 (back home in Texas, it's about $12-$14 a dozen.) I chose the 1/2 lb of blackened shrimp ($19) and my best friend chose the Bouillabaisse ($34 I think) which was assorted seafood like clam, crab, mussel, shrimp in a saffron broth. The item we liked the least was the Boullabaisse bc it lacked flavor but the oysters and shrimp totally made up for it. Honestly wished I had gotten a lb of the blackened shrimp because it was so good. And the oysters were big and super clean. Probably the best oysters we've ever had and everywhere we go to, we get oysters.   Would recommend this place! Worth the money! Left full & satisfied!"}
{"text":"Oysters are often mistaken as a food, when in reality they are a quest. If you are an oyster junkie, you seek out your oyster options well in advance. Being somewhat seasonal, oysters are not always on menu. I have in past refused to dine at restaurants which had no oysters. Often I have called well in advance to try and get a restaurant to hold some for me if I felt supplies would be running short. I have even attempted to get chefs to order oysters for me rather than face the risk of there being none. As I said, it is a quest. This is why when we were rushing through Harrah's in Las Vegas last week to catch some show, and I noticed The Oyster Bar, I felt fortunate. I stumbled on this place. Normally I have to search out menus to find oysters, which are often hidden, or which appear only as an infrequent special. But, here was an oyster bar. Of course we got back ASAP after the show, found two open seats at the bar, and took in the scene. First there was a small mountain of oysters well iced down a few feet from our seats at the bar. Second, I noticed the cooking station for shellfish, a device which appeared to operate on steam, and designed for rapidly cooking small batches of shellfish. A really nice, open kitchen feature. A server chef appeared in moments to take a drink and appetizer order. I got the Sierra Nevada Ale, a beer so good they named some mountains after it. My wife ordered a chardonnay. My oysters were shucked in front of us, so I knew there was no phony baloney trickery being practiced here. As an aside, many chefs buy jars or buckets of pre shucked oysters and when an order comes in they open the small bucket, remove 6 or 12 oysters from the bucket and place them on sterilized shells which have usually gone thru the high powered dishwasher endlessly until the shell is pure white, thin, and looks like no oyster ever inhabited it. Nevertheless, as much as I frown upon this corrupt practice, I have discovered that eating oysters in this troubling way surpasses no oysters at all. But, I digress. We also ordered fish and chips, excellent, and key lime mousse, also a nice house version or play on the now ubiquitous key lime pie. The oysters were from 3 distinct beds, and all tasted supremely fresh, and unique. I liked the lemon wrapped in a lemon colored wrap with a green ribbon; 50's yes, but so nice. Service superb, food outstanding, price right. I'm ready to go back. Indeed, if I lived in Vegas, I'd own a seat at this great oyster bar."}
{"text":"OMGOODNESS! Go here!!!!!!! Wonderful, wonderful fresh oysters in the half shell! We will go to this place every time we go to Vegas now, was told this place has been at Harrah's for 11 years! Why have we not found this gem! We both had a salad, it was HUGE and also ordered a dozen grilled oysters in the shell with parm and butter and garlic! YUM!!!!!! The prices were fine, the service was perfect, see you next year for sure!!!"}
{"text":"I love seafood and definitely got my seafood fix here.  The husband and I tried & recommend the following dishes:  1. House Roast  2. Oysters 1/2 dozen 3. Peel and Eat Shrimp 1/2 pound  If there is one thing you must try, it'd be the House Roast.  Oh yeah and warning: Ambience is cheesy (casino-restaurant) so don't recommend for a first date. =D"}
{"text":"We have to go here every time we come to Vegas. If you love oysters this place is a must visit. The fried oysters are the best. They are perfectly breaded and come with a yummy dipping sauce. We also like the seafood risotto  it comes packed with all kinds if different fruits of the sea including a whole lobster tail. Sit at the bar if you can that's where the best service is. This place is a hidden gem on the strip. I am so glad we found it on our first visit."}
{"text":"Sitting at the bar was the way to go, the service and performance was more than my I expected. Note to Self: Must re-do tomorrow!"}
{"text":"Best oysters I've had in Vegas!   Took my girlfriend and her mom in for a nice dinner and we got exactly what we were looking for. We tried oysters on the half shell, calamari,  Cajon scallops, blackened prime rib and the mixed steamer; all fantastic.  Carlos was our server and being prominent in fine dining, I give him an A+. Can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"You call this place an oyster bar and serve is the most pitiful dozen of oysters..? I couldn't believe how small and disappointing the dozen I ordered was. I was expecting something plump, but these were so small it was laughable had it not costed me $30.  We showed up about an hour before closing, so I guess I can see why they were so small; they probably served all the good oysters already.  The clams were okay and I wouldn't consider the jambalaya  to be anything too great. It was really \"wet\" because of all the tomatoes.   The only good thing they had was probably their clam chowder soup. That's pretty much it however."}
{"text":"Been coming here for years, but haven't been for a while. Nice surprise ... expanded and remodeled. A couple of oyster shooters, a dozen oysters and an entrees is my usual fare. This time they had Kumamotos which were delicious, then the shooters. Then I had the New England Shellfish Boil which was the best ever I've ever eaten! Lots of fresh seafood, perfectly cooked, with large stone crab claws to top it all. I rave. (And make sure you get some of those crackers they fresh bake.)"}
{"text":"Everything I order at the oyster bar is always good, never dissatisfied. I always go to the one at the Palace location. The pan roast is a must try. The only issue I have is the wait, whether I come at 6, or at midnight, or at 3am the wait is minimum hour and a half. I always wait knowing what awaits my palate BUT can't you do something about that? Can't you at least think of a better way of having your customer reserve their spot and if they're not back by the time a spot is available then whoever is there gets it? That is your only flaw! Don't you want to be perfect in service just like your food?"}
{"text":"The Combo Pan Roast was delicious but a little pricey at $30. The Oyster Bar at Palace Station has it for $20 but I have yet to try.  Anyways, the combo roast had a hearty amount of lobster and crab. The broth was rich and flavorful which soaked up very nice with the big scoop of rice that they give you.  Have an oyster shooter for $5 but I suggest you go for more since 3 goes for $12.   Next time I wanna try the Oyster Bar Six Shooter!  Bang Bang"}
{"text":"We ate at Penazzi for a couple of our friends' birthdays while we were staying at Harrah's.  We got dressed up for the occasion, though like most places in Vegas it wasn't necessary (except for the clubs).  We were given a the small room in the back with a large round table, which worked great for us.  We were served promptly, though it took quite a while for the food to come out.  At least in the meantime the bread we got with the balsamic dip was addicting.  I thoroughly enjoyed what I ordered, the special (a seafood risotto), though some of my friends felt they overpaid for what they got.  We also had some great entertainment from one of the hosts, who shared some Italian wisdom with us and some wine recommendations.  At the end of the meal, a couple of chocolate banana desserts were brought out for the celebrants, which we all ate up.  I can't speak for how it would be for a romantic dinner for two, but Penazzi sure is great for a big group."}
{"text":"If there's one thing I hate most when I go out to eat it is an inconsistent oyster bar. I've been here multiple times with my husband and each time has been crappy. The only positive thing I can say is the crab and corn chowder when it's available which is hardly ever is the most decent thing on the menu. Oysters are dry like they are old & they have no flavor. Barely any cocktail sauce is given and you get one wedge of lemon which is all dried up. The sushi doesn't seem fresh even though he's making it in front of you, it doesn't taste very good. The bread is always hard and you have to ask to get it. Once  we went and one of the cooks looked upset when we ask for more oysters as if we were bothering him. Please keep in mind we were the only two people sitting at the bar at the time. I think I'm pretty much done with this place! So many better places in the city. Suncoast your food and beverage department need to get it together and make massive changes to the oyster bar."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I came here one night for dinner and it was fantastic. We ordered a dozen raw oysters which were huge and delicious! We shared the seafood gumbo and a Caesar salad. Being a girl from Louisiana I was nervous about the gumbo but I must say it was delicious. The Caesar salad was great too however it was drowned in Caesar dressing that was a little bit on the salty side. Other than that the meal was great. The environment is very relaxing for a bar in the middle of a casino, with the waterfalls and rock scene surrounding it. I would totally recommend it to a couple for a date night!"}
{"text":"Oysters were pretty good. However the Lobster Soup was way too salty! Also the Mary Land crab cakes were way too salty as well. I wish we had just ordered oysters and gone to other places for the other half of our meal."}
{"text":"Love this place, delicious Pan Roast & Gumbo, good portions, fresh seafood & great customer service. Only draw back is the wait. If the line backs up to the atm/money changer expect a 2+ hour wait!"}
{"text":"This place is a must do whenever we're in Vegas. The food & service are both  excellent, not to forget the view of the people walking by inside of Harrah's or are they the people of Wal-Mart walking by. Wait,  they might be the same. I can reccomend the Steamers in white wine, any of the Oyster plates especially the Oysters Royale. Oh, the blackened shrip are excellent we did not order them but on our 2nd visit the chef had made an extra plate so our waiter offered them to us, a very nice comp & now we always order them."}
{"text":"This place is bad...avoid.  The clam chowder tastes like something out of a Campbell's can and there were chucks of cornstarch where it hadn't been properly mixed.  Do not get the shrimp scampi.  While the shrimp is good, the garlic sauce is flavorless.  Not worth the money."}
{"text":"Have been here a few times and it's been good every time. The server was friendly and knowledgeable. The food was tasty and on time. The price was reasonable. No complaints.   Cool atmosphere too. We sat under a waterfall."}
{"text":"Upon my wife's suggestion I stopped in here while she continued gambling. She had eaten here earlier while waiting for me to get out of a meeting. My intention was to get something light to hold me over till dinner, but I saw the menu and just ordered the first thing that sounded good to me. I told myself I wouldn't eat it all so I wouldn't be too full for dinner. I had a pasta that was pretty good with grilled chicken, andouille sausage, and ham. The Pasta was ok and the portion was really large. I tried hard not to eat too much but didn't do a good job at that. If I come back I'll try the oysters."}
{"text":"Tried the oyster bar in hard rock. I have waited several hours to eat at the one in palace station. I have to say this one is fantastic. The pan roast was off the hook! It had a great amount of seafood and the tomato base was fabulous. I recommend this oyster bar to anyone who is a fan of their food and dont want to wait in line."}
{"text":"Stopped here on my way back to Wyndham  Dessert Inn, Harrah's is where the shuttle bus picks up for Wyndham customers and let me tell you this, after a disappointing experience at Bacchanal Buffet at Caesars Palace where  oyster were good but shuckers at Bacchanal were slackers, too SLOW opening the well liked oysters , here at Oyster Bar at Harrah's, Rosi was quick in keeping up & opening up the fresh and plump Blue point oysters, they also have two other kind of oysters that you can try . Service was good thanks to Trent. I will back and will try the French Kiss oysters."}
{"text":"My wife and I went here bc I had a $15 off $30 coupon (thanks Station Casinos! Keep'em comin'). Anyway, its the only resto in Sunset Station that primarily serves seafood. We got the Oyster & Shrimp appetizer ($16) and Cioppino ($20). The oysters were pretty good with that fresh briny, salt water flavor while the shrimp were big and umm...tasted like shrimp. :P I like that they have a lot of sauces on the table so you can kind of taste test each once with an oyster or shrimp. The cioppino was good but it can't beat the one I had in San Francisco 3 yrs ago. Its served in a huge bowl with 2 big scoops of rice. Its slightly spicy with a good variety of crab, mussels, shrimp, and fish. I once came here before for their signature dish which is the crab pan roast. It pretty much seafood bolognese with rice. There are 2 downsides though with this place..1) PREPARE for a long wait time for your meal. I know its cooked to order which is great but after about 20 minutes you will start to feel the hunger pains. Testing your patience would be an understatement. And did i mention there were only 2 or 3 cooks and 1 waitress for the entire 25-30 seat resto? 2) The coupon is only good between 8-10 pm. We came at 730 pm and the waitress said we had to wait. So, we ended up leaving at around 915 pm. On a positive note, this place is close to our house so its the closest thing that we have to good seafood stew-type dishes."}
{"text":"First off, this place is pretty dead for a restaurant in a bustling casino. Just seat yourself and the waiter will eventually come up to you to serve you.   came here with my boyfriend because i thought this was the other oyster bar and ordered the pan roast. i honestly didn't realize i was at the wrong oyster bar until i got my food LOL  we both ordered the pan roast because my sister in law raved about it. the pan roast initially didn't look filling to me, even though it was filled to the brim with seafood and a scoop or rice. it comes with this creamy tomato based sauce with a little kick of spice at the end. comes with a bunch of shrimp, mussels, clams, and half a lobster tail. even though the bowl of food didn't seem too filling, i honestly could not handle the monstrosity that is this dish. the dish itself was 30 something dollars, so only order it if you're hungry!  we also ordered a side of fries, which costs around $10 - $12. although it was a big portion, the fries were way too salty for both of our tastes. ended up not even finishing half of it. might have to ask for unsalted and then salt the fries yourself, if that's possible.  one thing i didn't like about oyster bar was the fact that there was only one waiter. it sucked to see one man running around taking care of almost 20 tables by himself. so don't forget to be patient!"}
{"text":"Good food & great service. Went to Oyster Bar Friday Night & Saturday Night, food was really good and excellent service.  5 star! !! ;)"}
{"text":"The oyster queen approves! Fresh, plump and delicious! Diss the strip crowd, I'll be back"}
{"text":"The jambalaya was amazing! The flavor was one of the best I have ever had. I chose to get it with shrimp and it was delicious.   I originally asked the manager who took our order, what he recommended between jambalaya and the seafood risotto and he said jambalaya with shrimp with sub certainty I went for it. And I'm so glad that I did.    We also got a dozen oysters before we realized there were premium oysters available as well. The regular dozen was amazing! We also got a half dozen Rockefeller, which was very yummy too if you like grilled oysters. It's definitely packed with flavor, it's in the heavier side for an oyster but the flavor is worth it. After we had all that we realized there were premium, I had read in a yelp review that the shigoku is the one to try, but my boyfriend loves kushi oysters. I asked the main person and he said shigoku and the other lady agreed as well. We got a half dozen because we were already so full, the person was super nice and gave us 2 free kushi to try, so we could compare.   Shigoku wins for sure!! One of the most delicious oysters I've had. To me, I like the regular oysters better than the premium kushi, but everyone has their own opinion.   The service was amazing and the price was reasonable. You save $1 off all items if you're a total rewards member, any tier. So that's cool!   Great experience, I would definitely go there again when I'm in Vegas."}
{"text":"I tried the fries oysters basket which was serves with French fries. The fries were great, but the oysters were not cleaned as they should have been. The taste was awful which was really disappointing because I love fried oysters and they looked great but once I bit into it, all I could taste was poop/dirt. If you go here, avoid the oysters."}
{"text":"Underwhelming experience. Shrimp cocktail was on a dry side. Shrimp linguini were slightly overcooked and swimming in some milky sauce which was too watery. Oysters were OK. When it is busy, cold entrees come fast, but you have to wait and wait for the hot one, and then you end up looking at it and thinking why I had to seat for so long to end up with this. The waiter was a very nice guy trying to accommodate everyone."}
{"text":"A super surprising find at Harrahs.  Super tasty and incredibly fresh seafood where you sit around the bar.  Great service and decent pricing (for the strip)  would definitely recommend it"}
{"text":"The jumbo fried oysters are outstanding--the best anywhere. Though listed as an appetizer, not an entrée, they can assemble an entrée for you. Mine came with a small salad, which was also excellent, and I added cole slaw, which was good because it was not over-done with mayonnaise. The service was exceptionally prompt, also a very good thing. (They were not particularly busy at 4:30 in the afternoon.) The only negative (and loss of one star) was the noise level from the casino, which was loud. The décor is basic, but that's okay. I should also note that I tried the broiled oysters with garlic and parmesan. While good, they were not exceptional like the fried."}
{"text":"Much better than it would be.  The lobster roll the tiger prawns and a clam chowder we're all good. Everybody around us seem to be enjoying the oysters quite a bit."}
{"text":"I love this damn place. Ive been to new orleans a couple times and this is right there with it. The jumbalaya is killer and enough for 2 fatties. The shrimp cocktail is massive and everything else is on-point. The bread is just ok."}
{"text":"Fresh, fresh, fresh.   The most amazing oysters and the shrimp and grits are out of this world. Highly recommended!!"}
{"text":"The mild shrimp bowl was very delicious. We asked for a tiny bit of mild spice to it, but it turned out to be kind of hot, since I'm not a fan of spicy things. I ended up drinking all my lemonade and get full. The restaurant needs a kids menu, because what will the children eat besides shrimp and the crab appetizer? Overall, the food was good enough."}
{"text":"Stopped in for some oysters, and they were very fresh and delicious! Sat at the bar and watched them cook all these wonderful seafood dishes, wishing I had more time to try them out. Service was very friendly and prompt. Next time I'm in town, I'm going to make sure to come back and try some other things on the menu."}
{"text":"Not happy with the service. The calamari tasted like they were cooked in old oil, pan roasted seafood had good reviews but to my surprise it was a bit sweet. The only good thing was the fresh oysters Hope this help someone to think twice about going to this place :("}
{"text":"You like seafood? You want fresh, and unpretencious? This place is the best. Harrods is an oldie but goodie Vegas hotel, don't get swayed that its not the new grand other big named hotels. Get over to Harrods' Oyster Bar. Fantastic!!! I have been coming for years when it wasn't many people, it was just a small bar. This year, surprised to see more tables, and a wait to get seated. Oh My! But well worth it. You have to get a plate of oysters on the half shell, and then....go for it. My parents love the clams in white wine with pasta. I love the choppino. Everything so good. Sit at the bar if you can, and watch these guys work like magic, making the dishes right in front of you"}
{"text":"The Food gets a 5 the service gets a generous 2. Oysters were awesome as were the king crab legs. The service was comically bad. Was not rude or anything like that, was just the classic Houdini service. Order and watch them disappear. Basically had to wave my arms like landing an airplane to pay the bill. But food definitely makes it worthwhile just make sure to go there when in a carefree mood"}
{"text":"After reading the reviews here I had in mind what I wanted to order when I got to the Oyster Bar only to find they changed there menu just 3 days before. The new menu is up now on line but it wasn't when I was there this weekend. Seems like the menu has fewer choices. The food was excellent and fresh. We had a nice bottle of wine with our food. The Manhattan clam chowder was spicer than I have had before but thats what I liked about it. Now I am craving it. We even went back the next day to try the pasta dishes. Everything was great and we even enjoyed the people at the bar and the cook. I didn't see the pervert (might be cause I am a old grandma)."}
{"text":"We stopped by for a light lunch after arriving in Vegas on a Sunday afternoon.  The Oysters are truly fantastic and if I were in the area would definitely stop by for a half dozen - or dozen depending on how hungry I was.  So if I were rating this place on just the oysters it would probably get a 5.  I gave it a 3 rating for a few reasons; the bread they served was flavorless, it is basically in the middle of the casino so the atmosphere is lacking (and hard to avoid the smoking), and the clam chowder had very little clams - it was basically butter and cream soup.  I love butter and cream - but I wanted clam chowder and there just weren't any."}
{"text":"I have been to Vegas numerous times but had never eaten here. My co worker told me to come here. Im not a big oyster eater but my husband is. He ordered the half dozen grilled oysters...he was in love. I had the crab louie salad. Omg!!! Fresh, Fresh, Fresh is all that i can say. I really disnt need the luttuce. The crab and avacado was perfect by itself. Our srver Carlos was the best. Im a total rewards members so we got a bit of a discount. My husband wanted to go again but we didnt have enough time!! We will return!!"}
{"text":"The service was smooth, the pan roast was supreme and the crab cakes was high class eating. Also, the kale slaw was out of this world. So why not five stars (yet?)? Rookie mistake: the croutons on my Cesar salad were over-salted. I'm definitely coming again because it was probably an isolated incident."}
{"text":"I will never come here ever again; I don't know why I even bothered. It's incredibly weird that this place even has 4 stars. It just seems rigged...  For how much the food cost, this is a completely rip-off... The food is just SO bland and not fresh. If they charged half of what they did, then maybe it's worth considering.  For example, the oysters were really just okay; the lobster was just not that fresh, neither was the scallop; it had this really old tasting texture and never mind it was undercooked. The steak was just nasty; it's like someone took the worst piece of meat and served it to you.   I almost never give a place just one  star, but this one deserves it..."}
{"text":"Beyond excited to have found this little gem located inside Harrah's, and next time we visit will definitely be coming back here. Quick seating, very attentive service, excellent seafood and at such a great price! Started with a glass of sparkling wine and ordered a half dozen grilled oysters which were absolutely delicious wish we would have ordered a dozen, as well as the O.B's Pan Roast was chock full of all kinds of seafood and the sauce was very flavorful. Definitely reccommend to all seafood aficionados"}
{"text":"We visited the Oyster Bar at Harrah's for our first night in Vegas. This is our second time at the Oyster Bar. We went a couple years back.   This visit we sat at the bar and was waited on by Ly. Ly was awesome. He was attentive but not in a hovering kind of way and made sure we always had napkins or extra plates. He made our pan roast for us fresh and boy did he do a great job!! Two thumbs up!!   We also had the oysters and thought they were alright. The oysters were fresh but very large and plump...we prefer our oysters smaller and brinier. I guess the con won't deter us from enjoying the other wonderful dishes at this place.   Definitely will be back for that pan roast...hopefully we get Ly again!!"}
{"text":"We just discovered this new gem inside the Hardrock Casino.  We had crabcakes, fried oysters and pickles and raw oysters. Everything was fresh and delicious. The service was great.  The prices weren't too bad for a touristy area.  I live nearby and I plan on returning."}
{"text":"So we thought we would try this place  - since we had been at Hooters all day watching the football games.  By evening, we were in the mood for a lil seafood.    Looking at the menu, I was thinking, \"well, I'm sure I can find something I'll like\".  I couldn't decide so I went to yelp to see reviews and even looked at suggestions.    I ordered the Pan Roast - a house specialty and a suggestion on yelp by another yelper.  I even ordered the pasta instead of having it on the rice - since the reviews said the rice was NOT GOOD.  My meal came out, very different then expected.  The flavors were nothing as described and to be honest, when it was all said and done, the only seafood that was tasty was the prawns....The lobster was overcooked, the crab had a funny taste/smell - not a good meal.  My hubby ordered the Shrimp Louie Salad.  This came out and we both looked at each other.  This was served with mixed greens and very few shrimp - but MIXED GREENS???!!  What's up with that?  Throws the whole flavor off.  It turns it into a bitter salad and he was not please.  Also seating arrangements were not great.  We sat at a little booth by the water, but were soon faced with a large couple  - woman was wearing a small shirt & short pants....so we have to avoid looking straight ahead for fear of offensive \"coin slot\"... SERIOUSLY!  It's not that they're large - it's that a person - any person should be able to bend over in their clothes and not share their ass with the person behind them.....no punn intended.  Eat at Hooters. Can't go wrong."}
{"text":"Everything was delicious.  Gumbo was great.  Wife had the shrimp and lobster fra diavolo and enjoyed it as well.  Will be back if afforded the opportunity."}
{"text":"We had the oyster bar seafood platter for two at Harrahs. It totally hit the spot as a great appetizer for Two!  Oysters, crab, prawns, and mussels! Totally yummy!"}
{"text":"The pan roast is never consistent!  2/2014 - so yummy and full of seafood and sauce.  7/2014 - horrible and lacked seafood and any sauce at all.  8/2014 - better than last time but sauce was watered down and not as good as 1st time.  The waiter said it depends on the cook. Boo! That's awful for consistency! Went to Palace Station but the long was way too long and the seating over there is so tiny. The pics of the pan roast at PS looks amazing and full of sauce and flavor. We settled for the Harrah's location hoping it will be like the 1st time. But nope . Oysters were fresh and good though. Oh their clam chowder and coffee is pretty good here as well."}
{"text":"Very fresh seafood and quite decent price. Oyster is fresh, though not much variety. The  schrimp was delicious.  The fact the I had both lunch and dinner at this place must have meant something."}
{"text":"Usually stay at the South Point while in Vegas, their oyster bar is one of my favorite restaurants in the city.  Staying at Harrah's this trip, gave the oyster bar in the casino a chance.  Service was real damn slow.  Really slow.  On a Wednesday.  During lunch.  Oysters were okay, ordered with the pico, wished I hadn't, it's nondescript and not very spicy, did not improve the oysters, which were pretty small.  Waited5 minutes before I found anyone to bring me crackers.  That should never be the case in an oyster joint.  Anyway, reviews recommended the pan roast.  The tomato broth was described as creamy.  Sweet is a better descriptor.  Another 5 minutes to find someone to bring me a lemon to cut the sweetness. It was like Campbell's tomato soup sweet, but sweeter.  Seafood was pretty good, cooked just right, but the broth ruins it.  If you're in Hatrahs and feel like you have to eat there,  save your money and go to the noodle bar, pad Thai is excellent, and service is prompt and courteous.  Or go to the South Point and order the Seafood Diavolo at the oyster bar there.  It's well worth the money."}
{"text":"I love the variety of oysters they serve here I had a combo of chilian,gulf,Argentina and Costa Rica oysters. All of them were really good. The server was Mike from Hawaii he was nice to talk to and he recommended the gumbo for my fiancé and Yes! Go Gumbo! From fried okra to sausage slices to rice it was a well rounded bowl of gumbo and full of flavor. Would recommend gumbo. Overall, fun, convenient and my tummy was Happy:).. happy Eats!"}
{"text":"I will never go back and I'm kicking myself for eating here before I checked out the reviews on Yelp. I could have saved myself from the whole ordeal. I should know better by now,  I'm not a newbie.  Horrifically slow service. So slow it was almost non-existent. The crazy thing was, they weren't even busy. There were a few couples sitting at the bar and two other tables of people when we arrived. Judging by the lack of service we received, one might have assumed that this place was slammed. Nope, not slammed, just extremely negligent, poor service overall.   At this point, does it really even matter what the food was like? Not really. It would have to be phenomenal to compensate for the rest of the dining experience. And it's not, the food is mediocre at best.   Do yourself a favor and skip this place all together."}
{"text":"Every time I eat here, I leave impressed with the quality, quantity and taste of my meal.  Their whole steam kettle cooking system affords them an opportunity to cook that you only get with steam - and the results have always been impressive.  My favorite is the Mediterranean Salmon - I know of no other restaurant where it comes out so juicy and flavorful.  Mix in the juice with the rice and --wow-- on my list of top favorites for sure.  I've had several other dishes here and each one was truly great - as is the Clam Chowder soup."}
{"text":"This place was real good. The oysters are so fresh, as good as bar crudo in SF.  Got the Oysters and the blackened scallop pasta and the new england clam chowder. Everything was so good, besides the pasta in the scallop plate. but the scallops were delicious. Just get the oysters!!  One of my best meals in vegas. Will definately come back again. for 4 people the bill came out to about $100. Not bad at all."}
{"text":"This seafood restaurant was quite the surprising dining experience one evening for me and some friends. We ordered the combination boil and shared it (there was definitely enough food for several of us). I returned a few weeks later for the seafood etouffe and it was amazing as well. Honestly, it is some of the best seafood I've had, and the fact that it is so close to me at Sunset Station makes it that much better. I like sitting up at the bar and you get to watch them make all of the food. My only complaint is that the bar chairs seem too far from the actual bar so you have to sit up and lean forward quite a bit while eating. We also had oyster shooters which were surprisingly cheap, they had a special if you bought three if I remember correctly. The overall pricing was actually surprisingly reasonable as well (especially if you gamble at sunset, they frequently send $10 off $20 purchase coupons which make it VERY reasonably priced. Can't wait to go back and try more of their food!"}
{"text":"Ob pan roast is good but tasted a little sweet.  The seafood risotto also tasted awesome as well"}
{"text":"You know when you dine with the Dangs, they know what to order! I've been hearing about this place from other yelpers in Hawaii but I haven't gotten to try it till now! Why? I have never been a fan of going to Vegas because I don't gamble and well now that food is life. I have a reason to come back to Vegas and especially for this place!  After we our flight from San Antonio, we dropped our luggage off and walked over here. I had no idea what to order except oysters on half shell. The Dangs had suggested what to get and I trust them because they have never failed me on food. They're knowledge of food is just on top. Although, there were other locations we came here because this one was closet to walking distance.   On the table there was a rack of 6 different hot sauces... well 4-5 since 2 were duplicates. I had to try one of them and me had to pick the one that said harberno which wasn't as spicy as a I thought. It wasn't bad on my raw oyster.   I ordered a glass of white wine, while they had flat tire beers (I've had this at my favorite bar \"Village Bottle\" back in Hawaii. But I'm not a big fan of beers) We shared one dozen oysters on half shell, basket of fried calamari, and the O.B.'s Pan Roast. My gosh, that thing was delicious!!!!!!! I'm glad I listened to them and just shared. That pan roast was BOMB!!! The cream sauce and the seafood (mussels, lobster, clams, shrimp and crab claws) with rice was like heaven. Orgasm in my mouth. I will definitely go back for this dish! It is worth every penny! Thank you Mr. and Mrs. Dang for bringing me here."}
{"text":"We have eaten here 3 times and had great experiences every time! the oysters were very good...ceasar salad was excellant ... very crisp lettuce fresh crunchy croutons (does it get any better) BEST DISH THEY MAKE .....Signature House Pan Roast both times which includes all 3 of the seafood choices-shrimp, lobster & crab (small tip: get it over linguini MUCH better than the regualr rice it comes with) You can thank me later!!!   Also had a $50 worth of seafood for $25 coupon from weluvlocals !!! Cant wait till they offer it again!!!!!"}
{"text":"I've been to the Oyster Bar in Palace Station and was completely blown away.  So, when a friend told me that they had the same Oyster Bar at Sunset Station, I had to give it a try.  Sure, it's a long way from the strip.  But, I'm not kidding you.  Have a friend stand in line at Palace.  Drive from Palace to Sunset.  Sit down almost immediately in the Oyster Bar.  Order and get your food.  Eat absolute deliciousness. Drive back to Palace.  Your friend will still be standing there.  For those of you that haven't gone to either, you must try this place.  Any time I take a new friend, they agree that this is one of the best meal they had in Vegas.  There are die hard loyal Palace Station customers that will tell you that the dishes are better there.  I can't tell the difference except I don't have to wait 2 hours.  The meals are Cajun motivated and amazing.  Raw Oysters are the great, but the entrees are amazing.  Pan Roast is their specialty and I love the Bouillabaisse If you don't like seafood, you can get chicken and sausage option.  But I feel sorry for you since the seafood shines with the Cajun flavors.  Check our my list on Vegas, I just don't give any 5 stars.  I did here and at Palace.  Don't miss out on this one.  You will talk about when you go back home."}
{"text":"I don't just hand out 5 star reviews. ESPECIALLY after only one visit. But I have absolutely not a single doubt that I will be back for this incredibly fresh seafood. AND I DON'T EVEN EAT OYSTERS! We came on a Saturday night, and luckily since there was a fight going on, there was NO WAIT!! (note taken: come on fight night) After reading a ton of reviews, I pretty much had my heart set on the Signature Pan Roast with shrimp crab and lobster at about level 8 spice level, long before my arrival. But I also got a cup of New England style chowder first. Other than being along the coast in Oregon or Washington, best I have had!  This clam chowder was thick, with HUGE amounts of clams. Exactly what I expected.  My bf got the shrimp scampi, and the stepson went with the Bouillabaisse. It literally had one of everything in there! Like a big fish stew! Even the sourdough rolls they brought to the table were great. And watching the chef cook your food, as well as others is the best part!  My boyfriend is semi allergic to shrimp, and he still wanted to return for one of those beautiful lobsters. The spice in the pan roast was perfection, however next time I will get one scoop of rice instead of two. It soaks up the spice which I am sure most people usually love. The chunks of crab and lobster were full of flavor! It will be hard for me to order anything else.  The service was great, and in a casino you can't always expect that. Overall a wonderful place for good seafood and fresh shellfish!"}
{"text":"As stated in some of my other reviews, I LOVE seafood. While speaking to a coworker about wanting to go to the infamous Oyster Bar at the Palace Station, she mentioned the Oyster Bar at Sunset Station was very good as well with more seating... tonight we gave it a try.  There is definitely more seating at this location. They prepare the dishes at the bar, so if you get a chair at the bar top you can see the cooks/bartenders preparing the delicious eats.   After reading other reviews, I opted for the Pan Roast with shrimp, lobster, and crab. This was a delicious and rich dish served with a scoop of white rice. My guest got the Sunset Roast which had shrimp, crab, andouille, and chicken.  It was also excellent.   This was such a great seafood dinner that I would have loved to give them 5 stars. My only issue was the bartender/server we had was not attentive at all and quite unfriendly.  The good was so good, however, we will definitely be back, but sit at a table and hopefully have proper service."}
{"text":"Last 4 times in a row came here and guess what no oysters. Why is it called the oyster bar if you consistently don't offer them? If you call in advanced the staff will not connect you to the restaurant or even go find out."}
{"text":"THE BEST OYSTERS EVERRR!   Seating: When I first approached the cafe/sports bar, I thought we were going to be waiting for awhile.  But there's a lot more space as you walk through.  No wait at all on a Saturday evening!   Flash Fried Calamari, $12- light and crispy outside with soft and chewy squid on the inside.    Fish n' Chips, $18- beer battered cod with fries and coleslaw.  Fish was okay, not amazing.  The fries were nice and crunchy!  I would skip this appetizer.  New England Clam Chowder, $7- don't be deceived by the size of the bowl.  It looks small but so darn filling!  The hubs wouldn't share his bowl with me so I got a bowl myself.  It sort of filled me up too much to enjoy the rest of dinner.  Generous amount of clams, very creamy and delicious!    Manhattan Clam Chowder, $7- I had a spoonful of my friend's chowder and it was good!  Different but good.  It tastes like a cross between minestrone soup and clam chowder.  Sort of weird but I liked it.    Bourbon Street Jambalaya, $23- smoked chicken with rice, andouille sausage, ham, and a \"zesty\" sauce.  The chicken was waaay overcooked, rice was too soft because it was drenched in the sauce and everything was very salty.  SKIP.  Jumbo Fried Oysters, half dozen, $17- the guys in our group wanted this.  I had a bite and it was okay.  You can taste the batter but not too much of the oyster.  Oysters on the Half shell, dozen, $24- yump!  So sweet and delicious!  I would come back here just to eat a dozen of these babies all by myself!  No sharing!    Bottomline:  A bit pricey but with our large group, everyone wanted something different.  Skip everything else and just order the fresh oysters and clam chowder!"}
{"text":"Oysters little oysters and then there will be none. That line from Alice in Wonderland was stuck in my head as my friends and I sat down and enjoyed a whole lotta oysters here at Oyster Bar.   This was the setting for the beginning of my friend's bachelor party. We were all looking forward to this as we had some champagne in tow and a lot of smiles. Naturally we had to start off with two dozen oysters and I loved every single one I had. There was an excellent range and I loved that you could taste the difference in all of them.   Now, there was no way we were just going to eat oysters. Not with a lot of other delicious options on the menu. So, we had to dig into the crab cakes and get an order of mussels. The mussels were exactly how one would want them with a nice savory quality to the broth. The crab cakes were the real fun though. There was a lot of meat in them and we all had to put in for multiple orders.  Oyster Bar was exactly what I wanted and needed to start off my 40 hours in Vegas. We were all smiles and had a bunch of tasty mollusks to get us going. Welcome to Vegas!"}
{"text":"A must visit every time I come to LV. It's not cheap- a half dozen is about $15 and a full is $23. You don't get to choose your type of oyster either, but I enjoy it, along with the bread basket- crisp sesame flatbread accompanied with house rolls. The shrimp in the $17 cocktail are enormous, but you only get 4.   I like their house cocktail sauce."}
{"text":"Too bad the lowest is 1 star and not 0....  Where do I start?  The worst dinner in LV!  I was yelping around to grab a bite before heading to the piano bar.  Since it has 4 starts, i figured it couldnt be bad... oh boy... was i wrong. Food:   Oysters were already pre-opened.  who knows how long they've been sitting there uncovered.  It's raw food!  Dont you think it should be handled better? Crab salad:  The crab leg was still FROZEN when i tried to eat it?!  wtf... the green leaves were black and beat up.  dude, a $20 salad cant even have crispy leaves?!  the crab salad itself?  it tasted like you brought the tuna salad to your pinic and let it sit under the sun.  **YUCK**  After the nasty taste, the plate was still full.  I didnt even touch my dinner because of what we had to see. I didnt ask how my friend liked his orders but he didnt really eat his dinner. Service: OHMYGOD!!!!  it's disgusting!!!  Just thinking about it now gives me goosebumps.  The lady named Rosi...she's the worst person to ever be in the food industry left alone at Harrah's.  Since our waiter was too busy talking to the other customer even though we tried to get his attention for too long; we looked at her to see if she can help us get our waiter.  Her response was \" your waiter is over there.\"  No sh*t, i know that, so i asked if she can help me get him.  Her response was \"he will come when he comes\".  WTF?!  She was just standing there!  Then she started to clean up.... oh man, this is the worst part, Rosi.  She started to dig to the dirty containers to consolidate things BARE handed while a box of gloves was right in front of her.  We sat at the bar, so we saw everything.  She then wiped her hands to her uniform shirt, no not an apron, where she had been leaning against everything!  Then she moved on to dig into the raw shrimps, lobster tails, ..., pushing them down to cover them with those bared dirty hands w/ long red finger nails.  Not to mention, she wore a dangling bracelet that touched everything!  **YUCK**  Again, it's raw food!!!  oh then, her co-worker came and gave her share of tips, she touched the money, too, then went back to touching the food.  really?  I wanted to throw up bc I didnt know if she touched my food.  So we stopped eating. Another guy came over, brought the finished plate from previous eaters, grabbed the leftover cocktail sauce from that plate and put it back in the big container where they scooped out the sauce for the next customers.  Really?  you can charge people $23 for a dozen, yet you re-used the sauce from a raw dish.    So, we paid $100 for a dinner that we didnt touch.  We paid $100 to watch how disgusting this place was!  My friend didnt even want to pay cz we didnt even eat!  we would rather spend $100 on in-n-out!  All the manager said was, she would bring it to the chef's attention and ran for her life.    I wouldnt be surprise if people get food poisoning from this place.  I went and took my digestive enzymes right way, and drank more alcohol at a different place to kill the germ, well at least mentally, it would, after seeing that disgusting Rosi."}
{"text":"They served slightly overcooked grilled oysters before raw oysters. Like 10 minutes in between. On the other hand service was good and the oysters were fresh."}
{"text":"This is my folks' Tuesday night dinner spot with their best friends. So much so, that when I was on a date here ordering from Than (usually Glenn is sushi chef but he was off) he knew what table they sit in AND what all 4 ordered just by a description! The staff is very welcoming and kind to regulars (always ask for my folks or vice versa) Glen even knows what I like enough to make to go sashimi on the fly for me if my folks (who don't speak sushi) can bring me a treat.   Used to always get half dozen clams on the half shell & the clams in vermouth appetizer. Usually now, I go with sashimi. Glen will even ask if I'm still training, remember not to bring me bread & make sure I have low sodium soy sauce. Than was nice enough to bring my date & I some hamachi belly left from another order he was making. It was my date's first sashimi experience and he made it a great one. It is not a full sushi bar by any means, but the chefs are great and will even tell me which fish to go with that day, etc.   My folks and friends all enjoy the bread, pan roast, linguine with clams and crab cakes. Mom always gets shrimp scampi. I really enjoy how friendly and attentive everyone is. Even fellow diners: once I was chatting up a couple next to me from Mililani Town, HI where my best friend lives. Talk about Aloha spirit: as they were leaving, they asked if I had plans Sat night & handed me 2 tickets to Clint Holmes at the Suncoast Showroom! We were seated right next to his wife and Mom & had a blast.   I've seen people take digs at chowder, being an East Coast girl who summered on Martha's Vineyard most of my life, I can tell you the chowda is good, though I haven't had it in a while.   In all, this is a great place to come and dine in a relaxed setting on some great seafood served by folks who really care about their customers. The only minus for me is it is open to the very smoky casino."}
{"text":"This place was ok. We expected more for the price. When ordering the waiter completely ignored my step dad and didn't ask for his order.  Definitely not how to treat customers. My mom says the oysters were delicious. The calamari, on the other hand, was not even edible. The first time it came out it was undercooked and bland. It tasted like chewy batter. Not so surprisingly, cooking them more was not enough to salvage them. My boyfriend said it wasn't edible. My stepdad said it was \"pretty great for cardboard.\" Go to The Perch for calamari, instead. It is almost half the price and MUCH tastier. It wasn't a total loss, though. The bread and chips they bring out before you order were fresh and delicious."}
{"text":"One of my favorite spots to indulge.  I love the linguine and clams and clam chowder.  Love sitting right up at the bar and watching the chefs prepare."}
{"text":"The dollar signs next to restaurants in Vegas can be misleading. Although this place shows 2 dollar signs, it felt more like a 3. Bill ran to $100 on just 3 items.  Clam chowder was creamy and good but nothing to write about.  Grilled oysters with Parmesan butter was good but the main star was the oysters Rockefeller. They were insanely good. For half dozen it's $29 and the dozen is $40. We got two half dozen at the dozen price. The server was really cool about it.  The jambalaya with chicken was good, but it wasn't their best dish. Everything else is really on point.  Great place to grab a quick bite while you take a break from losing money."}
{"text":"Oyster Bar has a great selection of oysters on the half shell and is conveniently located in harrahs. Friendly service and healthy portions. At the end of the day, go for the oysters. Delicious."}
{"text":"If you like seafood and spicy this is the spot for you.  Pan Roast and Clam Chowder are my go to menu items here.  I try new things here and there, like Shrimp Scampi, Etouffee, Jambalaya but always come back to Pan Roast and Clam Chowder.  They are that good.  I've been lucky and never had to wait for a table.  Service is always great and the food is excellent, can't ask for anything more."}
{"text":"Chowder was awesome.  The Oysters were good but a bit on the small side.  Service was just average."}
{"text":"I want more of the Clam Chowder!!! LOL! The food was better than I thought it was going to be. My friend and I were deciding what to eat, and this place kept popping up when we Yelped \"food\" lol. I don't know how we kept seeing it, but well it worked. However...  We went arrived there wasn't a lot of people inside, but yet a lot of dirty tables just there. It didn't look attractive. It actually made my stomach turn. We were told to seat our self, but all the tables that were cleaned was ride next to another party. We sat in the back by the bar. The lighting was really dim. It was actually kinda hard to read the menu. I already had an idea of what I wanted, the Sauteed Clams in White Sauce w/pasta. ($2 extra for the noodles) My friend wanted to get the clam chowder and my BF wanted the oysters. We all ended up sharing which was great, cuz we loved all of it. There was so many clams in my pasta, I seriously think there was more clams than noodles. How often does that happen? The clam chowder was just out of this world. It reminded me of the one I had back @ home in San Francisco. The oysters were kinda small, but still delicious. It did get busy when we left.  I felt like the service didn't match the level of the restaurant. It wasn't the greatest, and honestly, it brought the place down. I mean like I said before the dirty tables, then it felt like we were being rushed in ordering our food. The guy came around three times in less than 4 mins. Seriously? How about you go clean some tables rather than rushing your customers. Then when our food was brought out, they didn't even ask us whose was whose. They just sat it down in front of whomever. So major star taken off!!  Overall, this place, was okay, the FOOD, was good. I would go back, but it's not a place that I would NEED to go back to. If the service changes, then yes I would make sure to go back."}
{"text":"We went there and first of the server was good. They brought oysters that smelled like something dead the fried oysteres were nothing but greaae a d the gumbo I will take back today I didn't want him to think I was trying to get a free meal. Now what I'm about to say is bad but I've been in the bathroom all morning since I've gotten up. My woman and I were ill the entire night. We sent all the food back they didn't give us a hassle. However I got to take the gumbo back today cuz it tasted off too. I explained to rhe server  my woman seen a video with oysters with worms and she hadn't ate them in about 2 years I finally talked her to go in and eat some and we got this meal. I'm more disappointed that I know now she will never eat another oyster for so long as she lives. I would have thought the people that serve oysters and crack them open and work with them all the time could just look at 1 and tell if it was bad let alone serve a whole plate of them. If you've ever smell rotting Coral or maybe a fish market at the end of a hot day that's what our plate smelled.  like"}
{"text":"I had the sashimi (Maguro -Tuna) really good and fresh, the sushi chef was super friendly.... they have my favorite sake, the fuji apple ( a must try)  and I had a shrimp scampi pasta.. I was good, white sauce was jusstttt right :)"}
{"text":"Still a great hidden gem! If you're looking for good seafood, without having to hit the Strip.. this is the place  My husband and I were without the kids, and needed to eat near the Galleria.  Before kids we went to the Oyster Bar which we loved. So we decided to head back after 10 years.   Still the same great service and food!   We were immediately greeted and told to sit anywhere we would like, I choose the bar next to the cooking pots. The aroma coming out of the pots was wonderful. Clearly whet my appetite.   We looked over the menu, which had all of your favorite seafood selections. We were up in the air between the Cioppino or Boullabaisse. Both looked and smelled delicious. After having a side salad, which was large we went with the Boullabaisse.  Lots of seafood - Clams, Mussels, Crab, Shrimp and chunks of white fish, swimming in a flavorful saffron broth filled with leaks and onions. YUM!  Couple of beers & wine, our meal was complete!   Only drawback, the clams were a bit gritty.. but that can happen...  Glad we went and need to go back sooner than 10 years from now."}
{"text":"Service fantastic.   Marc and Eric are professional and engaging.  Food is awsome!  Great experience!"}
{"text":"Horrible service 1 cook and the grill was broken fucking garbage will never go again as long as I live"}
{"text":"We was HUNGRY and craving some pan roast! However not willing to drive to palace station and wait 2 hours. Looking around... What do I see??? OYSTER BAR! Right here in hard rock! Reviews were good so why not. Good news is that there's virtually no wait here. Bad news is they close at 10pm. They offer a lot on their menu as well but we really wanted to just try the oysters and pan roast since that's what we were craving.   Pan roast was good, however not as thick as the palace station (Sorry for comparing but PS set the bar high). Even though viscosity was a little too thin for my taste, flavor was still on point. Spice level 3 out of 5 had a good kick without being overpowering. I'll probably get a 4 next time.  No bread came with it, only rice.   We got a half dozen oysters as well. They were smallish in size but still very good. Very fresh and not fishy.   My primary gripe would be that they have no draft beer here. Just cans and bottles which is not the same.    Overall, a decent spot for oysters and pan roast. Not sure I'm willing to go out of my way to come here though. Virtually no wait though which is a big plus!"}
{"text":"Mixed feelings about this one. Nice place to relax with a beer. Food was decent but nothing special. Shrimp coctail was delicious. Hard to go wrong there. Had the New Orleans Gumbo and all i could think through the entire meal was im eating brown gravy with meat. Thats pretty much what it tasted like. Good beer selection. Nice atmosphere, but pass on the gumbo. You'll thank me. Unless you love big bowls of brown gravy."}
{"text":"I was skeptical about dining here cuz it seemed random n out of place in Harrahs but man was I WRONG WRONG WRONG!!! Amazing oysters great vibe excellent service I can't wait to go back in March!! A must stop if u like tasty seafood!!!"}
{"text":"Combo pan roast is the best thing I've tasted in my life lol. It never disappoints me. I like this location because of the water fall, and of course there's always great seating with no long waits."}
{"text":"As we were on our way back from a day of exploring the strip, we got the desire for some fresh oysters. Our favorite oyster place with buck a shuck at Caesars closed so we decided to try the oyster bar at Harrahs. We walked through the casino and easily found it. Immediately it felt like a dive bar.   We sat ourselves and were excited to see a few familiar oysters (blue point, Kumamoto, kushi). We wanted to do a pair of each but since their computer system can't handle that, our choice was limited to ordering 6 or 12 of each kind of oyster. This makes no sense for any food establishment ever conceived.   We ordered half dozen kushi and half dozen blue points. The woman shucking the oysters seemed completely disinterested in life all together. I understand that shucking oysters is not a glamorous job but she avoided all customers around her, engaged nobody and worst of all, left shell pieces in each and every single oyster she shucked. We were given the oysters, asked for mignonette (had to be made separately) which tasted like pure ACV. Thinking this was Vegas we took a risk on this place but lesson learned."}
{"text":"Second time here and Dennis is my server this go around. His enthusiasm is contagious. So pleasant with everyone. Oh, and the oysters on the half shell are awesome too!"}
{"text":"We make a visit here each time we stay at the Linq hotel great selection and delectable food. Nice big succulent shrimp on all the dishes. Very nice variety of Oysters of course! Great atmosphere at the bar also! Good time always"}
{"text":"This was about two months ago but I got the pan roast and it was sooooo good. I still can't get over it. I love the service here and the food was amazing as well!"}
{"text":"My friends and I had stayed at Harrah's for Memorial Day weekend and kept seeing posters of this oyster bar.  One of the girls and I are crazy about oysters so we decided to check this place out.  The host/waiter (I didn't get his name) was extremely nice.  He was very friendly, helpful, and provided great service.  My friend and I ordered a half dozen of the Oysters Royale (raw) and half dozen of the Oyster Rockefeller (baked).  Both dishes were really good although I liked the Oysters Royale more because of both the caviar and oysters freshness.  Although it is a bit pricey ($30 for both dishes), it was well worth it."}
{"text":"Absolutely great fried oysters and dill pickles. Server Marc was very friendly and did a wonderful job."}
{"text":"In search for the seafood of choice we came to the oyster bar online. Looked great and out group of 5 decided to walk there for dinner. Keep in mind I happened to be with some affiliate companies and they are a goofy bunch.   When we arrived I saw that it was busy but the front of the house seemed overwhelmed. We needed a drink after a long day so we creeped into the bar space. I was confused as if I could order a beer or if it would be invading the space of everyone at the counter and bam, greeted by a happy face that brought us to a comfortable area. Beer and bloody in hand the table was now ready.   Server was friendly but didn't exactly match the personality of some of the guys at the table. I would have like to see the same welcome as we got from our friendly flexible bartender.   First order came and our platter of cold seafood got the undivided attention it deserved. Lobster,shrimp, clams, and crab overflowing on an 18\" platter will calm any growling stomach. I finished with a Halibut dinner and went back to our hotel room thinking about the food.   Seafood=Oyster Bar"}
{"text":"I have been her a couple of times and the food was good both times. If you enjoy raw oysters then this is the place for you, and there is even a raw oyster menu with a detailed description on the different oysters being served. Some of my favorite food to order include the raw and grilled oysters, New England clam chowder, Maryland style crab cakes, and the crispy one-sided red snapper!"}
{"text":"Been to the most famous oyster bar in Las Vegas, decided to come to this location to see if there are any differences, and there was! Even though there was no wait, which is a plus, but the flavors were not the same as the other location. The color of each dish weren't as vibrant as the other and it didnt look very appealing. Service was not too bad except I think the waiter had mixed up the spice level on certain items we ordered. I probably won't be coming back here even though there was no lines."}
{"text":"Better than the oyster bar at Palace Station, because the ambiance is somewhat better. Sure, you still get the noise of the casino, but at least the shitty rock'n'roll isn't blaring. It's closer to the strip, too. You can just sit at the bar and watch the open kitchen. The chef himself took our order.   We almost killed ourselves. We split a bowl of the clam chowder, which was incredible. Then came the jumbo shrimp cocktail, which was delicious, and with shrimp as jumbo as they come. Then came O.B.'s Pan Roast, every last drop of which we sopped up with bread, followed by the cioppino (be sure to order it spicy) -- phenomenal. At this point, we were hoping they'd forgotten about them, but no, they had not -- and out came a dozen Oysters Rockefeller as good as you've ever had. You cannot go wrong with this menu."}
{"text":"We sent for lunch. Food was just meh. Servers were helpful but were difficult to track down (it looked like they were short staffed). The bus person was very good though - kept our waters filled and bussed tables quickly. The main reason for the low rating is because the food was meh with high prices. Definitely would not recommend this place. Save your $ and go somewhere else."}
{"text":"I have been to the one at the Palace Station a few times but decided to make the drive to this location to avoid the long wait. This place not only has a bigger counter but tables. Came here with my family to show them what pan roast is. Last time I waited 3.5 hours for pan roast and my family could not understand what they hype it. We ordered 2 dozen of oysters, the shrimp cocktail, got a few pan roasts and a gumbo to share. They were in love!! The seafood was fresh and delicious! The shrimps were massive. My family was so impressed and happy with the meal. We ended the meal with the banana foster. Staff here is super friendly.  With our bellies full we went to hit the slot machines."}
{"text":"Five words: PAN ROAST WITHOUT A WAIT.  My group of 4 showed up at the Hard Rock Hotel on a Friday night around 6:30pm--prime dinner time--and were seated at the bar together immediately. BEAUTIFUL.   My friend and I shared the All-In Pan Roast ($24) with level 3 spice and found it to be a very tolerable amount of spiciness, just a low heat that wasn't too overwhelming with consecutive bites. The pan roast itself was creamy and had so many flavor dimensions in each bite that we finished the whole thing!   Service was attentive, and they even offered to refill our sides of rice multiple times. As a result, I walked out feeling stuffed and inadequate to hit the club a mere 3 hours later - alas, life goes on (and I still made it to the club, woooo)  I really hope this location doesn't blow up too quickly!"}
{"text":"Although this particular Oyster bar has a lot more choices and options on their menu, if you're coming here purely for raw oysters, clams (which they don't have raw clams, my fave), or other simple Oyster bar goods... Then you probably are better off heading out to The Palace Station Oyster Bar with that gnarly, unreal reputation. I kid you not, that place is THE best when it comes to Pan Roast, Bouillabaise and all the sweet seafood simplicities, but the line is always marvelously long...  So come here if you want decent food without the wait. Just don't have those expectations. I personally was debating between the Pan Roast and the Bouillabaisse. After reading a lot of you fellow yelpers' reviews, and after talking to the chef at the bar, I chose what I was hoping for a lighter option: The Bouillabaisse. Now it was good, it came with a variety of bread, but it doesn't come with rice (that is extra $), just the pot. It was good, not gonna downgrade it... The seafood meat was hearty, with various yummies... But I would easily say my biggest disappointment is that it was a little too salty. I don't even want to know how the Pan Roast would have been like.  Would I come here again? As a seafood lover ABSOLUTELY. But it doesn't hold candle to the OG bar at Palace Station."}
{"text":"Enjoyed the casual environment with delicious food! The grilled oysters and lobster bisque were my favorite! The service was great as well. Will definitely come here again on my next Vegas trip!"}
{"text":"Meh.   After arriving to Vegas on a grossly delayed flight from San Diego I was hangry. The legend of Oyster Bar's pan roast had been locked into my memory for months and seeing that the restaurant was located right outside of my elevator doors, my dining decision was quite simple.   \"I'll order the pan roast for two please.\"  Splitting this with a friend was the most cost efficient move but I think it's safe to say that we were both a little underwhelmed by what we received. Some bite had me liking the sweet broth and others had me hating it, but definitely never loving it. There was a healthy dose of seafood, which included lobster, shrimp, and clams but I also found it more than disappointing that some of the shellfish hadn't opened during the cooking process. No bueno.   Another factor of my meal that has me hovering on the three star rating is that my specialty martini, (that's how it was listed on the menu) was described as having blue cheese stuffed olives. Those who know me know that I'm an absolute sucker for blue cheese stuffed olives so when this drink showed up with your run-of-the-mill pimento stuffed olives I was very let down. Even when asking for the \"problem\" to be fixed I was met with an instant (and prepared/defensive) response of \"we don't have them.\"  Take your money elsewhere... maybe McDonald's?"}
{"text":"Service was good but not the best oyster bar We have eaten at. I ordered the gumbo and cesar salad and neither was good. The salad was o we dressed and did not taste like cesar dressing and the gumbo and rice were lacking in flavor. I was disappointed and left i satisfied with my meal."}
{"text":"We stayed at the hard rock and discovered this little place and I was happy we did..the food was amazing and the staff was even more amazing..especially our waiter..I forgot his name but I made sure I got the shift he worked and Mondays he is there 11-11 so we will definitely be back..it's really good to see restaurants that still has great service."}
{"text":"This place is great if you want your seafood fix for a pretty reasonable price. The only bad thing: limited seating! And it was a \"seat yourself\" kind of deal, so there was no hostess and we just had to hover and wait until a table was done eating to snatch some seating.   However, I felt like the food was worth the wait. What I recommend:  1. Jumbo shrimp cocktail: one plate has 5 jumbo shrimp on it and it was so fresh!! I could probably just eat two plates by myself.  2. House Gumbo: I think this is just a sweeter version of the Jambalaya. I'm not a fan of salty dishes or the spicy sausage so this was an excellent alternative. The house gumbo comes with shrimp, crab, AND lobster or you can get it with just one type of seafood. And the helpings of seafood was very generous. The dish also comes with a small scoop of rice. An absolute must try!  3. 1 lb of crab legs: This was super fresh and absolutely delicious and it won't break your wallet. Perfect for your crab leg craving."}
{"text":"My husband and I went to the Oyster Bar in Texas Station Friday, August 25, 2017.  It wasn't crowded but according to the hostess, they had limited staff and was sat at the counter.  He ordered the catfish basket and I ordered the Voodoo something (made with pasta, shrimp, chicken, sausage in a creole sauce) and asked the waitress, Kay, if it was spicy.  She responded \"No\"  After a LONG wait, the waitress returned with 2 orders of the catfish.  I advised her that I ordered the Voodoo concoction.  She took the catfish basket back and said she would put in the correct order.  As my husband ate, I had to wait even MORE TIME to receive my order.  You would think since they made the mistake they would have corrected my order immediately.  By the time I received my order, he was finishing up his meal.  I was so disappointment that I did not finish my meal.  We come here often and this was the worse service we have EVER received.  It was Friday!!!  Most restaurants staff up for the weekend!"}
{"text":"This place popped up in my yelp and I decided to give it a try :)   It's easy to find it's right when you walk in threw the parking garage on Harmon   I got the mule can't go to wrong with that... they give u some free chips to start as well   I started with the oysters they have east and west coast oysters they were yummy very fresh which is a wonderful change from some of the oyster bars .....  For my main I got the all in pan roast with least spice (I tend to get heartburn ) the portion size is great and the taste is just as great as well   The workers there were extremely nice and friendly I will go back"}
{"text":"Amazing. We ordered a dozen fresh raw oysters, a dozen Rockerfellers, and a dozen of the deep-fried ones. In the future I'd probably get all raw ones! They were SO good and delicious.  The fried ones were more batter and flour than oyster, so I would stay away from those if given a choice between the three.   There's not much to be said of the ambiance. It's too bad, because the oysters are SO GOOD. This place would probably be busier if it weren't a Monday night at 4:30pm. And if it weren't at Harrah's."}
{"text":"Came in for a snack during my weekend getaway in Vegas.  My party and I ordered:  New England Clam Chowder ($7) Oysters Rockafeller - spinach, hollandaise sauce and Parmesan cheese with a touch of Pernod, baked to order ($19) Oysters on the half shell ($25) Oysters royale - Wasabi caviar and chive creme fraiche ($27)  I'm not a big fan of oysters BUT the oysters here were delicious.  The best ones were the Oysters Rockafeller and the Oysters Royale.  They are a bit pricey but they tasted fresh.  The clam chowder was also delicious.  The soup had big chunks of clams and had a good ratio or potatoes and clams.    We had a pleasant experience though the waiters could have been more attentive."}
{"text":"its Funny how we were craved seafood being so far from the bay.. it was such a hot day and countless margaritas didnt really seem to cool us off.. WE both agreed something cold and yummy needed to satisfy our little hunger. Nice cold oysters at an Oyster bar. Let me tell you it was a nice little bar located inside Harrah's hotel my boyfriend and I sat and they brought us this basket of chips, butter and bread it looked really good. We got oysters, oyster shots fill with tequila and shrimp linguine ( my man got that and it was good lol ) we could have given this place a four star but it did take a while for them to attend to us and give us our bill.. we will come back next year.. or maybe sooner."}
{"text":"Nice servers.  Food is fresh and the wine was good. It is very pricey."}
{"text":"Absolutely fantastic. The service was pretty good, but it seemed that there were too many tables on the servers. It's not their fault, of course. Very nice food, reasonable prices, I'm sure that one day we will stop again."}

{"text":"A great little Vegas gem.  I had heard some good things about this place, and the reviews were right.  Wife and I shared a dozen and a half oysters with a couple of chilled Grey Goose shots followed by their Jumbo Shrimp cocktail, and ended with the seafood risotto and a few glasses of bubbly.  The oysters were really fresh, the shrimp were jumbo although I thought 6 shrimp would have been better than the 4 they gave, and the risotto offered some much needed warmth from the 50 degree weather outside.  I'll be back next time we're here...could turn into a tradition.  A walk down the strip, some oysters, vodka and bubbly only in Vegas."}
{"text":"We came here thinking that it was going to be like the Oyster Bar in Palace Station and we could save the drive+wait over there. Sadly, we were wrong.  The menu selection was much smaller than the other Oyster Bar, but they had a few similar items so we figured it would still work. At first, the server was very friendly and attentive. He got our drink orders right away and suggested a few items on the menu to help us decide what to order. My dad ordered the cioppino, my sister & sales guy got the recommended shrimp scampi, brother in law the fish and chips, and I had the Cajun scallops over pasta. The cioppino was cold, which is odd since all the seafood in it was overcooked. The shrimp scampi was super bland so the two people who ordered it were dumping salt and Tabasco on it just to make sure their taste buds were still working. My scallops were seasoned well, but all caked and burnt on one side. The pasta part of my dish was super bland too so I had to scrape the seasoning off of my scallops to mix in to get some type of flavor. I think the fish and chips were ok, so that makes it the best dish of the night. When the server came by, I told him that all the food was super bland and he just said \"bland? ok\" then cleaned it up and gave us the bill. In terms of price, it was pretty expensive too. Mid $20 - mid $30 range but you save $1 with the Total Rewards card. LOL. What a joke."}
{"text":"The quality of the food is slowly going down each time we come. The last time was probably the worst we had.   When the actual chefs are there the food is decent but once a sous-chef comes in and starts making the food, the food is no where near up to par.   The last time me and the beau came our bouillabaisse that we ordered had no type of flavor, the broth was near none (which is probably the easiest thing to add), no spice what's so ever even though we ordered a medium, no seasoning, very bland, and the guy forgot our side of pasta.    Sous-chef was too busy talking to his friends that were dining to even pay attention to the food he is cooking. Even letting the water run all over the floor for about 15 mins before he even noticed."}
{"text":"First time, so good, so full.. portions are super huge, price is reasonable for seafood.. Pan Roast Signature ..OMG"}
{"text":"The oysters had a several shell shards in it. My girlfriend and I had to spit out several shards per oyster. Also, the oyster plate did not come with utensils.   The fried calamari was soggy and unsalted. I found it very unappetising.   While our original server took about twenty minutes to show up, another server who noticed was very nice and attentive."}
{"text":"Food was good, service was HORRIBLE!!! We came in to a seat yourself, to nothing but dirty tables. Once we finally got to a clean spot took forever to get service. Many empty tables around us with dirty dishes. No staff to run the place. Nobody learning with smarter not harder. Get this place in shape & staffed!! Your food is very good, just get your service up to par. Clean empty tables=more income!!! Lean a little people!!"}
{"text":"This was difficult to rate, the food was awesome, the service was horrible.  We sat down at the bar, the menu is a plastic placemat so we didn't have to wait for that.  Everything else was a wait.  We sat for  minutes before we were acknowledged at all.  Then the cook/sever came over to see what we wanted.  We both ordered clam chowder, which we never saw.  I also ordered the Flash Fried Shrimp, my honey ordered fish and chips.  We could see others with a bread basked including yeast rolls and crisp flat bread, but we were not offered any.    My shrimp came out piping hot - 4 huge tiger shrimp with a light tempura batter.  It was served with a spring mix salad, perfectly dressed with a light but flavorful dressing.  I heard several diners comment on how much they enjoyed the salad.  The aioli served with the shrimp was tasty, but I prefer cocktail sauce.  I had to wait to catch someone to ask for it.  Now, this is an oyster bar, so it's not like there is no one around, they just won't look at you so you can ask them for anything.  i was going to ask for cocktail sauce and a bread basket, but he took off so fast I could only get out the cocktail sauce.  He plopped that down and disappeared, and I had to ask the oyster schucker for a bread basket.  She tried to ignore me as well, but finally turned after about four \"ma'ams.\"  The cracker like flatbread had seasame seeds and was great! I could only eat 3 of the 4 shrimp, but they were wonderful.  My husband's fish and chips was hot and flakey, also lightly battered.  It was served with a small cup of cole slaw.  In the end we had to ask for the bill and wait for the cook/server/casheier to finish his conversation with some other patrons before he rang us out.  I should mention (since this is an oyster bar) that the folks that had oysters around us RAVED about the oysters.  They were offering 3 different varieties, and it looked like earlier in the evening they may have had more.  A man sitting next to us had worse service than we did, the server forgot his order entirely - twice.  We ended up laughing with him about how utterly bad the service was.  Such a shame, since this could be a knock out spot based on the food.  The menu has a good variety for dinner items at a pretty good price for the quality.  Just expect to have to flag down a server and wait a lot."}
{"text":"We ordered an bowl of seafood for 2 and a salad, and the amount is enough. The taste of the seafood bowl was really great! I don't remember the name of the bowl but we both loved it! The server was nice, too!"}
{"text":"Food was decent, but service was severely lacking.  Couldn't get a single drink refill the entire night.  Very disappointed and unlikely to return."}
{"text":"DO NOT COME HERE FOR THE PANROAST.  - overpriced - Palace Station's panroast is 100x better  Clam chowder (4/5) - This was good Calamari (3/5) - Just okay  I must say, i did NOT try the oysters. Maybe I just ordered the wrong dishes here but I would not come here to try the panroast. This place is WAY overpriced compared to the oyster bar at palace station which is much better."}
{"text":"What a surprise! I got a $100 food voucher and was too lazy to leave Harrah's so I thought I'd just give it a try. This place blew me away.. I did get a bunch of clams full of sand but they took care of that and replaced my meal. We had a feast and everything was amazing, oysters, surf and turf, cioppino. Shaving service. Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"Never a disappointment,,,, Oysters a various selection,,, tuna tartar  plenty and good!!! Fried calamari needs some improvement... I shall return!!!!"}
{"text":"Probably not the place you'd expect to have some BOMB Boils but they do. So good in fact that it will make you lick the plate clean! No dishwashers needed. It's located inside of Texas Station. I would advise to come with patience and not expecting much of service. You will be lucky to be greeted right away and to receive refills as well as even get your order taken right away. If they do, it's your lucky day. The Louisiana boil though, so delicious, sure to awaken your palette. It has potatoes, corn, sausage and your choice of shrimp or mussels and the sauce, the sauce, oh my. I have no idea what's in it but it leaves you savoring for more. It's definitely my favorite and I never try anything else. That's how much I enjoy it."}
{"text":"This place has gone downhill in the last few years. Last time they totally f-ed up my order and the oysters weren't particularly tasty or well shucked. I'm no longer eating here, there are too many better options on the strip."}
{"text":"Very good bar food. Good Pina cola at $3. How you not love that. Fun place to hang out."}
{"text":"This restaurant was disappointing because we expected better for the price and positive reviews. We were seated towards the back corner and there was not much light. We can see the cooks making food from where we were sitting and it didn't look very sanitary. We ordered some seared scallops with pasta and the pan roast. The flavors were really lacking and not memorable. Our waiter was attentive up until it was time to pay, he took so long with the check that we were getting tired of waiting. Overall, it was a pricey meal that did not deliver."}
{"text":"BEFORE YOU HATE ON MY RATING, I just have to say that my review is NOT for the oysters.  I don't eat oysters, not because I don't like them, but because I'm afraid to like them..too much.  Haha.  So I'm sure this is the place to go if you want oysters but my review is solely for their crab cake, sauteed clams in white sauce, and their customer service.  First the crab cakes: very good price.  I read the menu and knew right away that that was what I was going to order.  $16 for crab cakes is about right..but wait until see the size of those babies!  They give you two huge gallops of crab cake, with real crab meat and a slight crunch on the outer layer.  The salad it sat on was amazing and the sauce it came with was even better.  I'd come back for their crab cakes anytime!  Now their pasta:  I was preferring the Shrimp Scampi but since my friends were already ordering the sauteed clams in white sauce, I thought..wth, I'll give that a try.  If it weren't for this dish, I may have given Oyster Bar 4 stars.  But because of this dish, I've decided to subtract a star.  ALMOST TWO!  This dish was...unacceptable for a restaurant of their status.  Yea, they give you a lot of clams...more like a lot of shells with no clams inside!  I thought, maybe they all fell out.  No.  I know the difference between clams and pasta.  It was really bland, too.  I couldn't even finish my portion.  The three of us left a pretty large amount of pasta behind.  No doggy bag, thanks.  Finally, their service.  Although friendly, it was slow.  We had a party of 9 but was waiting for 2 more.  Our waiter told us to \"holler\" when we were ready but how do we HOLLER if he's nowhere to be seen?  Also, two elderly ladies walked in and were seated next to us about 15 minutes after we sat down.  How come they were served bread before us?  Doesn't make sense.  So all in all, 4 stars for crab cake, 1 for clam pasta, 2 for service."}
{"text":"Just got into vegas and I had to come and get my oyster fix! I ordered raw oysters and my Mother ordered the grilled oysters. Both were delish! It is a Tuesday and there was no wait we just sat right down and Trent helped us out. He was a great server and very personable. I'll be here until Thursday so I'll probably be back again before i leave because of his great service and yummy oysters!"}
{"text":"Thank God there's a location here!  I was not willing to wait 2+ hours.  Even on a Sunday night around 9 we called the one by the strip and the wait for 2 people was about an hour and a half.  It might be worth it just to drive out here, but my friend lives nearby so we went to this location.  No wait!  My friend LOVED the oysters.  I feel like I've had better, but he really liked the horseradish and cocktail sauce that went with it.  We ordered one pan roast and one etouffe.  I was wondering what the different between the two was, and the pan roast is definitely creamier, like you're eating pasta sauce.  I wouldn't say this was mind-blowingly different from other pan roasts I've had, but delicious nonetheless."}
{"text":"Where is a place in Vegas where you can go to get oysters...Oyster Bar. Your not coming to this location because of the atmosphere, staff or scenery, your coming here for purely the oysters. The oysters deliver! We had many servings of the oysters no shell, sand, or horrible smell. They were delicious. If you like a variety of sauces with your oysters well Oyster Bar delivers. There are many to choose from with an excellent horseradish on the side!"}
{"text":"While the Oyster Bar offers what you would expect of a restaurant with its name (i.e. the fresh, shucked oysters are great, as are the Alaskan king crab legs served with steaming hot butter), the treat of this place comes in its kettle specialties.  Take a seat at the bar, order a cold one, and watch the chefs scoop various types of seafood (depending on what you order), condiments (garlic, etc.), and sauces (the special house roast sauce is my favorite) into a little pot and cook your order in front of you.  Most of the kettle specialties are served piping hot in a bowl filled with rice (or with pasta if you order the scampi).  Because the portions are so large, you can easily save half for lunch the next day... which makes the prices more reasonable, considering the food isn't cheap."}
{"text":"Seriously one of the best oyster bars I have ever visited. The quality of the food is amazing, always fresh and fast service. The menu is short and to the point. Our favorite oyster variety here are the NY oysters. They're cleaned and shucked properly. Nothing is worse than a sandy oyster, it won't happen here!  We have been here about four times now and with each visit it just gets better. The clam chowder is delicious. Our favorite entree is the pan roast. It's a huge bowl (enough for two people to easily share) of jasmine rice, seafood broth and either lobster, crab, shrimp or all 3.   The bill was Roughly $75, this included 3 beers, flask chowder, a dozen oysters and a pan roast.  There's another oyster bar at fiesta station that's open 24 hours, but there's always a 2 hour line. This location closes at 10:30 (early for us las vegans) but there's never a wait so it's worth the drive.   Happy eating :-)"}
{"text":"My husband and I love this place. They always have the freshest seafood. The food is always good. It has never disappointed. Good job!!!"}
{"text":"This is a review purely on oysters cause that's what I got. The oysters that I got was $20 -$25 for a dozen including tax and tip. I sat by the bar where we got to see the staff opening the oysters up. It was pretty pricy but wasn't a surprised since we were in the middle of the dessert so it is probably hard to get seafood out there. Anyways I was extremely surprised by how fresh the oysters tasted and no sand!! I'm not exactly sure what the different oysters were because we got a mixed but I enjoyed them all.   My friend ordered Manhattan Clam Chowder and did not enjoy it very much. It was red/orange and looked like a tomato soup. She actually said it tasted more tomato than clam chowder.   The restaurant is pretty small, the kitchen is right in front of you. If you sit by the bar you watch then make everyone else's dish. I guess this is why some of the other food isn't as amazing like some people were expecting because I don't think they had a specialize chef for some of the food. I saw like some guy who looked like the manager and other stuff help cook the food."}
{"text":"This was one of the most perfect dinners I had with my husband while we were in Las Vegas. It's inside Harrahs resort and it's a seat yourself kind of place. We sat right at the bar and watched all the action while the chefs prepared everything right in front of us. I'm not a big oyster eater, so I had calamari, which was absolutely delicious and came in the most precious fry basket to the table. It was hot and fresh and cooked when ordered. My husband has a half dozen raw oysters and a half dozen grilled. Both were perfect he said. Everything we watched come out of that kitchen was visually stunning and would have made me attempt to eat mussels. I highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Very nice place, the waiter is friendly and fast, the oyster is fresh and tasty, the price is worth. We ordered fresh oysters half shell, fried oysters, grilled lobster and king crab leg. The fresh oysters half shell is my favorite. We will come back to try another dishes."}
{"text":"Delicious steamers with variety of sauces, such as vin blanc, fra diavolo, pale ale broth, white clam sauce, etc.... Plus you can add pasta to any steamer bowl. Yum city! Don't forget to try their grilled oysters. Need a little mood lighting and music and good to go. Who would have thought to find a gem in the middle of Harrah's Casino."}
{"text":"The gnocchi with bolognese is outstanding. Probably the best I've ever had. Service was great. It was a very quiet restaurant and romantic. Give it a whirl. You can also get a half off coupon coupons from Tix for Tonight."}
{"text":"We were walking the strip...and decided on this spot. Absolutely amazing. What a hidden gem. Reymundo was excellent! It literally was a one man show ....so service was a little slow...but the taste made up for it. I'm not a huge Yelper but this place deserved it!  So delicious. We had the mixed oysters and steamed wild mussels. Definitely returning!"}
{"text":"Before going into the Oyster Bar, I started to sniff the air right when I entered the casino near the restaurant to see if I smelled THAT fish smell. Anyone who has eaten seafood knows that concerning fish smell which serves as a warning to all of us to NOT eat from this establishment or you will be praying at the porcelain bowl for the next two days. However, I smelled nothing but seafood joy coming from Oyster Bar, so we went right in and started looking at their menu.  I like Oyster Bar's menu because it isn't 18 pages long (a la Cheesecake Factory). One page of food, one page of booze, and we are good to go. I informed the server of my gluten allergy, and he was very careful and checked with the chefs (who work in an open kitchen two feet away from the tables)to make sure I could eat the dish. To play it safe, I got the House Combo Boil (Louisiana Style), and I was very surprised at how good it was. Sometimes Boils can be overly seasoned and are easily overcooked, but this one? Perfectly cooked, and seasoned in every way, The mussels were a decent size, and the crab and lobster were still tender and delicious.  My husband got the Cajun Peel and Eat Shrimp, and WOW. I could eat that all day long. I could have easily eaten a pound of that shrimp, amidst the pain of peeling each individual shrimp, happily on any day of the week. Once again, perfectly seasoned, great sauce and cooked just the way I like it. We also took two oyster shooters each which made us both intensely happy.  Now if you're a seafood snob and come here you may comment that the seafood isn't as good as let's say Maine, RI, etc. However, you're off the Strip in a locals casino. Take it for what it is, enjoy the good service, very friendly chefs and delicious, fair-priced food that will satisfy most of our palettes. Also, who doesn't love cheesy lighted waterfalls and people watching?"}
{"text":"I am not a fan of oysters but I am a HUGE fan of the Oyster Bar at Harrah's and I have always stopped it for a meal or two on every Vegas Run since 2007.  The New England Clam Chowder has always been good especially with their complimentary flat bread.  My favorite meal is the Surf and Turf.  They do have a full bar so pairing a nice cocktail or even a simple Coors Light with your meal is possible.  I would recommend sitting at the long bar just inside so you are no separated from the cooks by a sneeze glass as you are at the outside curve bar.  Also while seated at the inside bar you are able to watch the TV on the back wall of the kitchen.    Dennis has always been our favorite.  We were bummed earlier this year when Dennis was out do to a motorcycle accident.  He is now back and his hi-energy will make your visit enjoyable."}
{"text":"I love oyster bars. My usual joint is the oyster bar at Sunset Station in Henderson, but I heard about the bar in Harrah's and wanted to give it a try.  Like most places on the strip, it's spendy. For instance, the $15 Crabby Mary was a slightly sweetened and disappointing take on a bloody mary, garnished with just a lime wedge and two olives, served in a pint glass.  We ordered the steamed muscles in garlic butter broth. This dish was really good and better matched to the price, however the bread served with our food was pretty meh. The bread basket included four bread rolls that looked like the basic grocery store twelve roll pull apart variety, and some crispy flat bread that felt stale. The upside to the steamed muscle dish is all that delicious broth to soak up with your bread, and soak we did. When we asked for a second round of bread, we just got 2 of the generic rolls which meant some broth went un-sopped... so sad. All in all, the oyster bar at the Sunset Station is still my favorite in the LV/Henderson area for better prices, no skimping, and better bread."}
{"text":"I ended up here after Miller's Ale because I really didn't enjoy my dinner there. The Oyster Bar is located in the Sunset Station hotel. It's a decent size place and over the weekend I had the option between sitting at the bar or sitting at a table so I don't think it ever gets crazy busy.   I was helped almost immediately once I sat down. I sat at the bar and they brought out bread and butter and a menu. The menu is hard to read so if you wear glasses, bring them or be ready to have someone read you the menu.   I stayed at the Sunset Station for two nights and I ate at the Oyster Bar both nights. That's how good it is. The first night my sister and I ordered half a dozen oysters on the half shell. Soooo delicious and fresh. You can't come here and not order oysters. That was just the starter. Then we shared the linguine with clams and red sauce (they offer the option between red sauce and white sauce). Decent amount of clams and the pasta portion was huge. We shared one plate and still didn't finish it. Beware that the linguine has TONS of garlic. I would definitely ask them to go light on the garlic if I ordered that again.   On my second night here, I once again ate the oysters. Just as delicious as the first night. Service was still very quick. I decided to give the clam chowder a shot and so glad I did. It was perfect since it was pretty cold out. I ordered the bowl version instead of the cup. The bowl alone likely wouldn't fill you up unless I just have a larger appetite than I realize.   The Oyster Bar is the top spot in Sunset Station and  likely in that whole shopping area altogether. Take my advice and don't waste your time at other restaurants in the hotel."}
{"text":"Ate there last night after watching a movie... it was the best Jambalaya I ever had. Plenty of fresh ingredients. I was surprised to learn they use fresh claims in the shell and real lobster. I highly recommend this restaurant."}
{"text":"The quality of the seafood dishes are only ok but the oysters are pretty fresh. Service tho is kind of lacking. I've been here a couple years before and it was much better then. Probably won't coke back"}
{"text":"First time I've ever been to an oyster bar. Prices were phenomenal for what was being served.  One thing that I cannot stand is horrible customer service. The chef was great until he had the look of impatience on his face. Look dude, my first time going give me a break. I'm a customer, you're the employee. Help me to help you.  Farha was great, however, standing there talking to your coworkers in the doorway that faces the bar where I was sitting, not good. Because we wanted to be updated on our bread basket but instead we had to ask the cook, who was the bartender, server, chef, and maitree d'. Horrible customer service, food was great. Sounds like an F &B manager needs to revamp the staffing, and training material."}
{"text":"I come here and drag all my friends here every single time I go to Vegas. I always sit at the counter. It's so much fun to watch them cook the food. My friends all enjoy this place because of the amazing service and food. When I go there, they all work their schedule around it or change plans to go too!  The cooks take your order and cook the food right in front of you. My favorite cook is Ly. He's so nice and remembers me. Even when I'm not in his section, he comes over to say hi. Uh, maybe I do go to Vegas a little to often :/"}
{"text":"This restaurant was great in every capacity!! The service was great, the food was awesome and the drinks were yummy. I had the cioppino and I have never tasted anything like that. It was loaded with all types of seafood and had an excellent well balanced flavor. I will definitely be returning here soon."}
{"text":"I have been coming here for 15 years since they open. Before that I went to the one at Palace Station. I think this one's better the service is better the food is cheaper but the quality is superb. It just opened a new one at Santa Fe Station but this one still has better service and better food. You can't go wrong here."}
{"text":"OI've always wanted to try this oyster bar.  Was never able to fit it into our hectic schedule, but finally made time for it this time.   Came during lunch, it was pretty quiet and you just sent yourself. Sat at the bar, so I could watch the food being made, and read reviews on service and didn't want to be forgotten.   Ordered a dozen of blue point.  They didn't have other premium oysters to pick from, and ordered a flash fried calamari.   It came with a bread basket.  We didn't get anything with broth, so couldn't really dip the bread in anything (next time!!).    The calamari is really good, not too much batter, cute presentation and lots of calamari with 2 different sauces.  A warm spicy marinara sauce and Aioli. The warm marinara sauce went very well with the calamari.   The dozen of oysters were really fresh.  The horseradish had a strong kick with every shot.  Was definitely very good and service was great.  Had a lot of attention since we sat at the bar.  Will definitely come back and try some of their other menu items, but oysters are a must!"}
{"text":"This restaurant was remodeled and the name changed.  Still has good food, menu pretty similar.     Has been called Briggs Oyster Co for 5 or 6 months."}
{"text":"I've never had a bad experience or service here. I love their oysters on the half shell. So fresh and they do a pretty good job shucking the oysters so that there's rarely shell pieces on the oyster. I've been here so many times now but my favorite item on the menu that I recently tried is the cioppino. Hands down an amazing dish. Filled with tons of a variety of seafood (mussel, clam, lobster, shrimp, scallop, etc), and a fragrant spicy tomato based broth. My family ordered the OB pan roast, the sauce taste a lot like mesquite bbq sauce. Sweet and Salty but full of seafood as well. Overall everything was good, service friendly and attentive, I'd come back on my next trip!"}
{"text":"Omg this is 5 stars for there oyster Rockefeller will order it as an appetizer and a entree it's that bomb everything else is ok"}
{"text":"Good food. Good service. Sitting next to a waterfall while eating seafood is fun. Being in the middle of Sunset Station isn't as fun. Sunset should make this restaurant one of their most prominent - its the best place they have."}
{"text":"Food awesome and tastes authentic! Service horrendous..sat at the bar two chefs work up there along with two other guys one I saw make a few appetizers but mostly just talk to his girlfriend who was sitting at the bar..the other guy I'm really not sure what he did other than walk around. Placed an order and never spoke to another soul until we got our food, after that had to beg for the check. Drinks not even water got refilled. No sure I'll be back the amazing food doesn't outweigh the poor service."}
{"text":"Woo hoo~ Deals are still to be had in Las Vegas.  A dozen freshly shucked oysters for $20! We made the mistake of ordering other things like the oyster shooter and Rockefeller oysters neither of which was a bargain or exceptionally delicious. We should have just gotten two dozens. No, wait, make that 3 dozens! I regret that I spent $200 at Bouchon. I could have had at least 3 meals at the Oyster Bar with that money. I ordered a glass of Prosecco, and the pour was extremely generous. Almost filled up to the top. Yeah! My husband got a strawberry margarita, which was delicious and stronger and cheaper than the one we had at the Mirage.   It's a must-try on the strip in my book."}
{"text":"My wife and I wanted to try a different spot, so instead of going to the palace station oyster bar, we came to this one at harrahs. The positive about this place is there is a lot more seating and workers, just a bigger restaurant in general.   Other positive is the good friendly service.  Got the OBs pan roast which is crab, lobsters, muscles and clams with rice and tomato sauce. It was ok. It wasn't as creamy as other restaurants, it was actually really watery so that threw us off. We got the portion for 1 and it might be enough for 2, this portion runs about $35.  We also got the half dozen oysters grilled. I thought this was pretty good, runs you about $20?   Another negative, $4.5 for ginger ale. Come on now lol. Just a so so place, wouldn't come back w all the other options."}
{"text":"Loved the clam chowder! Moon was horrible with service his co workers carried him he is a hard worker but maybe better positioned in a non customer facing fixed position production role as language was a slight barrier along with focus and customer service. Oysters very good! Jambalaya very good. Tucked inside Harrah's its not confortable sitting on bar stools and the ambience / view is just ok."}
{"text":"Solid 3.5 stars because there was no wait. I like how this location actually has tables AND a bar top. I came around 1 with 2 friends and there were only 2 other parties in the restaurant. Our server Desiree was really sweet, she brought out sour dough bread and some pita like chips which were pretty good.   I was hoping they would have the seafood clam chowder which comes with lobster bits like the Palace Station location but they didn't. I settled for a bowl of the clam chowder instead. When it was brought out, I was surprised at how small it was. For $8, I was expecting something a bit bigger, but it was good. My sister and I shared the pan roast ($20) which had lobster, crab and shrimp... we wanted it mild and we got something that didn't have a hint of spiciness at all. I guess we should have told the waitress that we wanted a 3 or 4 out of 10 for spiciness. My sisters' bf ordered the same thing and he got a level 5 spicy. The waitress was kind enough to split our pan roast for us into two bowls. We didn't know that they would give us 2 rice bowls as well so we ordered another side of rice ($2).   Unfortunately the pan roast at this location isn't as good as the one at Palace Station. I'm not sure why. The chef wasn't as generous with his seafood portions as the Palace Station location either."}
{"text":"Awesome place for oysters,  our server Moon was very helpful & nice too. If you like oysters the mixed dozen is where it's at.    Overall great experience."}
{"text":"This is my go to Oyster place,  everyone talks about the palace station oyster bar being the best in Las Vegas but i have never been there still because of how busy i heard it was all the time!  This place at Sunset has a lot more seating space than Palace station, and is not as crowded too.   We actually only go there once a quarter whenever they mail us a coupon for the players club, sign up for the players club even if you dont play much. You get $15 off $30 for a meal. But, it is always a treat whenever we go, the oyster and shrimp cocktail are always fresh, they gumbo is the best too. They do get busier towards dinner hours on the weekend, but stop by in the afternoon and get some oyster snacks there should be no wait."}
{"text":"Its nice to get there early. It will get busy. The food is good and the service is pretty good too. Sometimes there's only one cook and one server but, even with that its worth going.  Check it out if you haven't already."}
{"text":"I love oysters and if you're on the strip looking for some delicious oysters...make your way to Harrah's! Their raw oysters are super yummy!"}
{"text":"Hands down one of the best meals we've had in Vegas. Friendly staff, AMAZING food... not much else you need. I got the oysters rockefeller and my husband got the jambalaya with chicken.... they were both absolutely great. So glad we came here."}
{"text":"Never have I ever gotten as great of service as I did here. Andrea was a model server, I feel like management should really know that and note accordingly! She was beyond accommodating and had an amazing personality. I'm not one to ask for servers, but if I came back here I would definitely ask for her.  Now, onto the food.  We had four people and shared everything. We started off with two bowls of clam chowder: Manhattan and New England. She was a sweetheart and split it two ways each so it was easier to share. The New England was mediocre and didn't come out piping hot like the Manhattan. The Manhattan was delicious, especially when we added the \"Ass Kicking Habenero Sauce\" that Andrea brought without us asking.  We also ordered fried oysters as an appetizer, which could've been hotter but it was still decent.  The steamed clams in the white wine butter sauce was much too alcoholic-tasting. I don't think they let the wine reduce enough. I felt like I was drinking wine at times (this was probably my least favorite dish).  For entrees we had the signature pan roast (shrimp, crab, lobster) and the Cioppino. The seafood was cooked well in each, although I felt like the fish fell apart a little too much into tiny pieces. But both were a little disappointing.. The pan roast was sweet to a point where it felt like I was eating Thai coconut curry. The Cioppino lacked flavor, although it was leaps and bounds better when we added the habenero sauce.   Overall, we would definitely go again to try other dishes. Especially with a star waitress like Andrea!"}
{"text":"The worst service EVER!!! I had total of 4 people in my party. This was my birthday dinner. I read the reviews & thought this would be an amazing place as I love oysters. I called before arriving to see if we needed reservations & if they had my favorite oysters. I was told no for reservations & yes for my oysters. When we arrived I was told they didn't have the oysters I wanted & the service took FOREVER!!! Each of our platters came out about 15-20 minutes apart so we didn't eat together. I couldn't get our server to bring me any water. We spent 11/2 hour there waiting for our food... The food was great but I wouldn't go back with the issues with the service. Took a total of 2 hours. The other guests near us were also very frustrated."}
{"text":"I can't believe I've been staying Harrah's all these times and I have never tried the Oyster bar! What is wrong with me!?  I'm so glad I was able to dine here with my family before watching Legends in Concert (show in Harrah's, see review).  It's a rather small spot, super open to the casino so when we walked in, the staff behind the oyster bar told us to sit wherever we wanted. We sat at the bar, not inside the restaurant but on the oyster side of the bar. There were five of us so we managed to pull together three SMALL round tables to fit our drinks and bread and butter our waitress brought out. Cool! It was a tight squeeze though!  Bread and butter, yum! Nice, crusty and wheat bread with room temp butter, yes I was drooling. My mom ordered the clam chowder and a CRABBY mary. The crabby mary has a nice sea taste that I loved. It was pretty strong, I had to help mom finish it, lol. Clam chowder tasted like the sea! The chowder was super chunky and the bowl was pretty big. We ordered two, two-dozen oysters and six oyster shooters. The oysters were really good! Kept fresh with good horseradish and cocktail sauce was the perfect topping. The horseradish sauce was super strong which is hard to find at some oyster/seafood place. The oyster shooters were six oysters topped with vodka and an extra-large shot of vodka chilled in the middle. My sister, her fiancé and my dad and I were all buzzin!   The bill was pricey but it was well worth it. Good food with family making more crazy memories in Vegas = priceless."}
{"text":"Great place for fresh or Rockefeller oysters, and a good selection of fresh oysters! This could be a bit pricey but then again, you are in Vegas."}
{"text":"This is one of my go to places in Vegas. It's not the fanciest but the food is good. The oysters are always on point! The first time I came here, a year ago - the pan roast was perfect! This time, it was still good but overcooked. They were kind of busy so I won't hold it against them but this place is definitely worth a try. If you're an oyster fan and want something good at reasonable prices for being on the strip - come here!!"}
{"text":"Definitely can't go wrong with a visit to the oyster bar! I would have to agree that the oysters are nothing to run home and tell about but they are decent! You would think that they would have above par oysters being that the restaurant name is themed around that particular item! The infamous pan roast happened to be one of the items I ordered and it was exactly what I anticipated  it to be! VERY GOOD! Filling and rather tasteful :-) I got a medium but i think I'll do more spicy the next time! Clam chowder is a hit! I wish it would've been hotter though! This location I inside the Texas is much less busier than the one located inside palace station! This meal was comped so it always taste better :-D now that I know about this location I'll be coming here over the other because that long wait they always have is ridiculous! Although well worth the wait!"}
{"text":"I absolutely love the oyster bar! Service could be so much better however the food definitely makes up for it! My favorite dish is the combo pan roast! I get my pretty hot because that's the way to go! This particular one is located inside of the sunset station hotel and casino! A bit of a drive for me as I usually go to the one located in the palace station and or Texas station since thAts closer to home! Happen to be leaving the galleria mall one night and figured I should check this one out to see if it was just as great as the others and low and behold it was!"}
{"text":"We stop here several times whenever we're in town. Great location, just right inside Harrah's, which is nice when we stay across the street. They fly their oysters in that morning, so always fresh!   Their clam chowder is amazing! This last time we were there they had afternoon drink specials, 2 for 1. The staff is always friendly and helpful. Sit at the bar, and you can watch them prepare everything, and chat with interesting folk!"}
{"text":"I had the seafood risotto and it was excellent. My friends had a steamed mediterranian mussels, the Bourbon street jambalya, and shrimp scampi, they all said it was good, but not the type of amazing food that will knock your socks off. However, the service left much to be desired for these types of prices. The entire time we were there, the waiter never came to ask how we were doing, how the food was, if we had any issue, or even just to refill our water. The waiter was inattentive when we tried to flagg him down. Was curt, very unclear in telling us about the dishes. I felt that I was paying 4 star prices for a fast food experience."}
{"text":"Worried about waiting for 2 hours so we arrived about 3pm anticipating a wait. We got sat in 15 minutes. The 15 seater run by 3 chefs and 1 wait staff and host totally efficient!  I had the seafood gumbo with a heat level of 4. Every bite amazing rich with tons of big pieces of shrimp, lobster, crab and andouille sausage. My husband has the seafood pan roast which was so delectable and buttery.  I would eat here again and again!!!"}
{"text":"Terrible! First of all they have No restrooms. The shrimp and crap ravioli was over cooked and when I flipped my first ravioli it was broken and didn't have any filling inside! They gave me 6 over cooked ravioli two were broken and Unfilled for $18.99. My husbands salmon linguini was also over cooked and the sauce was tasteless and watery.  The server on the other hand, was nice and apologized for the terrible experience. I will not be giving this place a second chance."}
{"text":"We stay at Harrahs regularly so it is convenient to eat here, but that is not the reason we do. This place has some of the best prepared seafood I have ever eaten. The oysters are flown in daily so despite a negative review I read on here they are FRESH ! All the waiters are taught to prepare all the dishes which make it very convenient. The following are dishes which I have enjoyed; creamy clam chowder, shrimp cocktail, crab cakes (superb), a shrimp dish with bruschetta under it, king crab and on and on! You will not be disappointed if you venture over to Harrahs and belly up to the bar! Enjoy!"}
{"text":"I honestly wanted to like this place it's not fresh and over price just go to joes crab the clam chowder was good I got the salmon not good! The shrimp cocktail was great .."}
{"text":"Reasonably priced Seafood with other special such as Bananas Foster. Pepper can ice cream. A great place to go recently Christ finger in a casino and hotel."}
{"text":"My girl loves the Oysters Royale w/ Wasabi Caviar bit pricey but worth her smile. I personally do not like oyster's all that much but hear these are an amazing appetizer/small meal."}
{"text":"My boyfriend wanted oysters, so after walking along the strip for a while, we popped into Harrah's.  This place is actually a dine-in restaurant, unlike the literal oyster bar at Palace Station.  Luckily for us, they served raw oysters and had them available on a Sunday night.  There was no wait; most of the dining area was empty, but the bar was full.  Although signs said they closed at 10 pm, all the servers and chefs were wrapping up as soon it was 9 pm.  I saw them flip the open sign to closed.  Just a note: I think Harrah's has a different crowd than some of the other hotels on the strip.  The hostess was friendly; servers were attentive with our drinks.  They gave us a complimentary bread basket with butter.  The dinner rolls were ok; the fried bread thing was alright.  I ordered a dozen oysters for $30.  They were really good (or maybe I was just hungry).  I have to say I didn't get food poisoning, which I was afraid of.  They have several sauces on the table, but I only used Tabasco.  I don't think they had options for which kind of oyster to get because the waiter just brought out a platter.    I'm giving them four stars because they were very satisfying.  It's a good place to go if you need raw oysters."}
{"text":"I have to say that I'm very disappointed. Maybe because I had such high expectations prior to coming. I had oysters in New Orleans that I still can't get out of my mind. Everywhere I go, I try to look for baked oysters that melts in my mouth.   When I found out that this place served baked oysters with butter and Parmesan cheese, I was ecstatic! Boy was I disappointed! The oysters came out room temperature. It was flavorless and had no scent of parmasean or garlic. :( For $24 a dozen, I expected them to be bigger. It was actually very small compared to many other places. Overall experience was ok and overpriced food."}
{"text":"What a pleasant surprise?  Never thought a casino would have such fresh and tasty seafood.  Oysters were fresh and delicious.  The pasta with lobster was also great.  Service 5 stars.  It is not often I give a 4 star rating but this place earned it."}
{"text":"Ordered the surf and turf. It came with a small rip eye steak 3 shrimp. Also garlic mashed potatoes hard and cold. Extremely disappointed. Small portions and over priced."}
{"text":"Wow waited for over an our for our food, then my wife turned and noticed sitting on the bar behind us was the 4 bowls of gumbo for our table. As I walked up to ask if it it was ours one of the cooks said have a seat and we will bring your food out. 11 minutes later a waiter grabs the bowls that was 10 feet from our table and starts passing them to us. The gumbo was ki .ca of room temp to cold by then :( terrible service from the waitress. Food would have been great had it been hot or at least warm...."}
{"text":"As I'm finishing up my meal, this started as 4 star but it dropped to a 2 star purely based on the service.  The food is really good, we had the oysters and fish and chips but it's overpriced.  $36 for a dozen oysters is the most I've ever paid!  There is no acknowledgement and it took us 20mins to get our check.  For how expensive it is, I would have expected the service to be top notch and I've had better service at McDonald's."}
{"text":"THIS PLACE WAS LIFE CHANGING. I went with my boyfriend after day club. We shared a dozen oysters and both got the pan roast.  The pan roast is AMAZING, man. They don't skimp: it was packed with scallops, clams, shrimp, lobster, etc.  The broth is packed with flavor.  Paired with a glass of white wine, you're in for an amazing meal."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I went to try this place after reading good reviews on Yelp...I was disappointed.  The oysters weren't very fresh, the waiter was stuffy, and my boyfriend's salmon and rice came in little itty portions served on an oversized plate. I also tried their \"Sugar Daddy\" cocktail and it tasted like Tylenol.  I don't dislike the place but I probably wouldn't go back."}
{"text":"The pan roast here is LIFE. My world has been completely changed by this dish. It's rich, decadent, spicy, delicious, and oh so comforting.   As we approached the restaurant, I wasn't sure if I was going to like this place. It looks quite a bit outdated. But so does this entire casino as a whole, so I didn't think too much about it. I've also seen that there are other locations that you'll have to wait MUCH longer at, while this one is a bit off the beaten path and a lot easier to get into.   Now, I didn't come here for the service. We came here because my boyfriend and his dad were talking up this pan roast like it's the best thing in the world. So when the service wasn't amazing, I didn't mind too much. It wasn't terrible service, just a little lackluster.   Now onto the food. They start you off with some warm bread and these crunchy flatbread cracker type things. We tried their caesar salad and it was fresh and delicious. Nothing crazy or special, just traditional and tasty. Then comes the pan roast, which I always get with crab, lobster, and shrimp. It's creamy, tangy, spicy, rich, and served with a big scoop of fluffy, white rice. It's almost like a creamy seafood stew with a kick. Comfort food epicness to the max. I like to dip the crispy crackers into the \"broth\" to soak while I scoop out tender pieces of delicious seafood and rice.   While we were in town we went twice to get his dish. That's how amazing it is. I would definitely make the trek out to try this location rather than waiting at the other one!"}
{"text":"Oysters on the half shell, grilled oysters, oysters rock, clams, clam chowder, rib eye, split lobster tail.  Not one food complaint from our group.  The oysters were fantastic, the rib eye tender, the lobster succulent, clams were tasty.  Our only complaint was that we were seated, and never got service for 15 minutes until one of our party finally walked up to the bar and told them.  After that we were promptly served for the rest of our meal.  It would have been 5 stars for other than the service.  Note that this place is NOT cheap.  It's on average about 25$ for a dozen oysters.  You can certainly find them cheaper off the strip, and at various happy hours around the area, but we wanted a place we could walk to from where we were staying.  Our party of 5 racked up a 202$ bill for food and drinks w/o tip.  Some times ya just gotta splurge!   We went here the first day of a 4 day stay and I dreamed about these oysters the last 3 nights.  Yes they were that good, and I've had oysters from WA to CA to FL to ME.  These stand up to any I've ever had."}
{"text":"so I've been hearing a lot of good things about station casinos Oyster bars and been wanting to try it out. My fiancé and I finally made the trip to the sunset location. As we walk in the place was already packed but gladly there was two open spots at the bar. We were greeted right away by Darrel and took our drink orders. He also cooked our food infront of us which was very cool. I had the fra diablo pasta, dozen oysters and she had the crab pan roast. Oysters were fresh, my pasta was well cooked but that pan roast...OMG that pan roast was so good! I can't stop thinking about it and she even dreamed about it lol. It was that good. I'll be coming here more often just for this. we topped off the night with bananas fosters which was perfect to cleanse the palate. overall great experience. My only complain is dirty menus and they have there bus tub of dirty dishes facing customers for everyone to see while dining but I don't care for that lol as long as they have good food."}
{"text":"The food - seafood sampler and fish tacos - was good. The oysters, which I guess is a typical issue not being right on the coast, a little bit fishy. The tacos were a little weird, but tasty, with their instantly-crumbly shells. Very difficult to eat. The people were fantastic, though. Very helpful and friendly. It helped we were there, too, when it was not at all busy. Five stars for the help, but the food was not up to expectations. Given other much better options, we're not going back."}
{"text":"This is our FAVORITE place in Vegas! The food is fresh and satisfying and JOEL AlWAYS gives the best service! We fly all the way to Vegas just for this oyster bar !!!!!!"}
{"text":"It is because of this place that I fell in love with Oyster this is the reason for me to come back to Vegas.. it's so worth it.. fresh oysters, with amazing horseradish + cocktail sauce.. the amazing thing was that there was no wait!  tomorrow i am going to palace station oyster bar to do a comparison.  how can oyster be this good? its amazing how man found God's creation..   thanks Harrah Oyster Bar.. you did well.  p.s. i didn't know why they changed the restaurant title... it confused me... penazzi italian?  where was the italian?"}
{"text":"I was first introduced to Oyster Bar after a college vegas trip and I sure missed this place! I have eaten at the palace station oyster bar a couple more times since then. After moving to Henderson for school, I was mailed a coupon booklet with $15 off of Oyster Bar so I decided to come back after a 2 year hiatus.   Right off the bat, I like this location over the palace station location due to the abundance of seating. The palace station oyster bar is just as good, but they are limited to a small amount of bar seating. The sunset station oyster bar has a larger bar and they also have plenty of table seats.   Ordered the Signature Gumbo (3 types of protein = more gains) and Jambalaya. It was as good as I remembered it to be. My gf is from Louisiana and she has eaten a wide variety of different jambalaya/gumbo/etouffee at various events (LSU tailgates, parties, etc). She really loved the gumbo and jambalaya here (she normally hates those dishes at other restaurants).   The food is a bit on the expensive side here. Gumbo & Jambalaya came out to $42, but with our $15 off, it came out to $27. The portion sizes here are gigantic. We had more than half of meal left over, which means we have dinner for another day."}
{"text":"Highly recommended for relaxing and fun dinner before a show. Sit at the counter for friendly, attentive service. Clam chowder great. Shrimp excellent. Fish tacos delicious. Cold seafood platter nice except for the lobster which was overcooked and not flavorful. Tiger prawn saute looked fabulous as so did the salads."}
{"text":"We came here because of the oysters. I've definitely had much better but for the price, I suppose it was okay. There was still plenty of liquid in the shells that I had to keep draining out prior to eating the oysters. I sampled an Oysters Royale from my dining mates and it was okay but definitely nothing to write home about. My martini was good and chilled nicely. The rolls they brought to the table were actually stale, which was a disappointment. Our Bourbon Street Jambalaya was actually quite flavorful. I have to give props to our waiter for his patience because our party couldn't make up their mind at first and he stood there calmly as they finally made a decision. Then our party decided to move tables (to the interior dining area) and he was very accommodating. Kudos to him for that!"}
{"text":"Just finished a convention, haven't slept much and I needed to up my zinc levels. To the oyster bar I went.. Coming from Maryland I am PICKY about my oysters. Size, taste & texture are just the start..  Blue point oysters from NY are sweet, not briny and plump AF.  These were that and more. Maybe it was the naked cowboy hot sauce that came in the tower of treats or maybe it was the two dirty captain martinis or maybe it was the hot bartender?   Ordered a dozen and each one was better than the last. The horseradish was the kind that kicked any cold you have (or could have 10 years from now) to the curb REAL quick. Amazing.  So happy I stopped by after CES!! Go, now, especially if you're paleo like me and have to live off meat and vodka in the desert."}
{"text":"Came to Las Vegas to visit family they recommended a good oyster bar not far from where they stayed. We got here ordered 1 dozen oysters a couple of them were very small so I asked if I could exchange them they lady was very polite an actually brought a a few extra and let us keep the smaller ones. Well let's just say service was great food was good. I will be back."}
{"text":"I was reluctant to write this review because of one person, Cassandra. I waited until the next day so I could reach out to Julie, the Food and Beverage Manager and/or Amy, The Executive Chef to see if we could resolve my issue, neither one returned my calls. So because Cassandra was SO BAD I decided to write this.   I went to the Oyster Bar to enjoy a bowl of Manhattan clam chowder and fried oysters. They were prepared by an amazing chef. He has made them for me before. In fact they were SO GOOD, I decided to order two additional orders to go; one for my daughter and the other for me the next day. This time Cassandra, a Manager NOT a chef, prepared the fried oysters. The first order, that was prepared by the amazing chef, had 8 small to medium DELICIOUS oysters. The order prepared by Cassandra had 5 small to medium oysters. My server had told me that they weigh the oysters, so I brought this to Cassandra's attention. Cassandra said NO YOU ONLY GET 5 OYSTERS THEY ARE NOT WEIGHED. I pointed out to Cassandra that was a crazy way to determine a serving portion because oysters come in various sizes from small to very large. And especially because not 10 minutes earlier I had a great portion prepared by an actual chef not a \"Manager\" on a power trip. Even after I pointed out that I'm paying the same amount $12.00 an order for 10 oysters as opposed to 16 had I ordered them all at the same time. Cassandra told me that she was going to have a \"talk\" with both my server and the amazing chef. So instead of complimenting the only two people that deserved the compliments, and the only two people that made me feel welcome, Cassandra, the genius, is going to reprimand them for treating a customer fantastic.   I tried reasoning every way possible with Cassandra from telling her that I've been a customer of Texas Station for 20 years, telling her that an even longer customer of Palace Station (since it was the Bingo Palace) and lastly that I eat at Austin's approximately once a week for years. Nothing could get through her mindset. Any \"manager\" that ridged is not meant for that position. She actually choose THROWING AWAY 2 bowls of clam chowder and two orders of fried oysters as opposed to pleasing a customer. And the cost to Texas Station for keeping a loyal life long customer would have been, what, $2.00?  I have NEVER SAID THIS IN A REVIEW BEFORE but Cassandra needs to be replaced in a non customer service roll. Or just outright terminated.   ***************UPDATE***************  Julie, the Food and Beverage Manager, called me back today August 10, 2017. As it turns out she was off the past couple days. We discussed the situation and she agreed that there must be a better way to determine portion control that provided a more consistent look. She said she was going to talk it over with Chef Amy and see about other ways to be more consistent with order size.  Julie also stated that she also was going to talk with Cassondra regarding her people skills.  Lastly, Julie went way above and beyond the call of duty, and invited me to have dinner on her on my next day off. This really surprised me because you really don't find people willing to go the extra mile in the 21st Century. So I graciously accepted her offer and will call her with the day that I'm going to give it another chance. I hope that after my do over we can get that 1 Star up to 5 Stars.   More to follow."}
{"text":"Great food, except to that Filipino server- he was very rude and always rushing! Only bothered to ask for refill of water and  \"how's the food?\" when we're almost done eating. Also, gave us an attitude about using our $ food complimentary."}
{"text":"Great customer service. First time there,  and it seems  Thursday is a good time to go.  Very few people,  had the linguine and white  clam sauce .   I will  be  a regular on  Thursdays. Lot's of clams!"}
{"text":"DO NOT CONFUSE THIS PLACE with the Oyster Bar at Palace Station- completely different. Somehow GPS led us here instead of the other one we really wanted to go to- I mean it wasn't bad- but when you were expecting a pan roast with creamy sauce and instead you get a jambalaya looking thing you are a little bummed. Their version of pan roast is completely different and it wasn't until the food came out that I realized we were at the wrong place! No wonder there was no line! However, I must admit I really liked how they sliced the lobster pieces in half so it was easy to eat. :)"}
{"text":"This is a late review but just reminiscing on my vegas trip got me thinking about this great restaurant. The service was impeccable. We thought we were sitting at the bar when in actuality our chef was our server as well. This was amazing. And he carried on a good conversation. We wanted an upscale dinner away from the norm and this definitely was. From the calamari to the oyster shooters to the Ahi tuna Salad we were impressed. There are so many restaurants in Vegas and this was one of our favs. Hard to eat twice at the same place but we are most definitely coming back."}
{"text":"It has been great everytime, except for the fact that their time for closing is not correct! You should prolly get here over an hour before there post that they actually close. Otherwise you just get the \"we're sorry\"! Rosi, is the worlds worst manager and should be let go!!!!"}
{"text":"This is an awesome oyster bar. The oysters on the half shell were fresh, and sweet. Their Oysters Rockefeller were delicious with the perfect balance of Hollandaise, spinach and cheese. I had the Crab Louie salad and it was divine. It was a perfect balance of butter lettuce, a huge portion of crab, amazing Louie dressing. The balsamic glaze drizzle added a touch of flavor and made the presentation perfect. My husband had the Clam Chowder and he loved it. The staff were fun, friendly and knowledgeable. It is a definite place we will come back to very soon.   We are locals, and this is one place we would recommend to friends here and friends who are visiting."}
{"text":"Went here on a Tuesday evening around 5. The waiter we had was Trent he was very attentive and the food was really good. I had the grilled oysters and a half pound of blackend shrimp that came with a side salad. I will definitely be back my next visit and it was very convenient because it was right across from the hotel I was staying in."}
{"text":"All Oyster Bars are not made equal. I didn't wanna do the inevitable wait at Palace Station's Oyster Bar so I came to Sunset Station's instead. The restaurant is like 3x as big in terms of seating with 2x as many boilers to cook the pan roasts in. It's not just bar seating too as there are tables and booths for you to enjoy the food. As for the menu, the menu items are the same with a few differences in name but that's about it. I ordered the Sunset Pan, which is essentially the Palace Pan Roast with all kinds of meat in there. For $22, I want to think it was cheaper than Palace Station. But you pay for what you get and the flavor was just not there. It was lighter in terms of color, the flavor was not as strong, it was also less creamy and more watery. It also seemed like it was a bit smaller. It was so depressing considering all the expectations I had coming in. The spice level was OK but I feel they might've flipped my spice level with another dish we had ordered. We also had the jambalaya and and etoufee. Both of which I also thought wasn't as good as Palace Station's.  In terms of service, since it is larger, the service wasn't as great. I think they need more people working in terms of the number of servers to guests. They were not very attentive and needed a better system because people were just walking around.  So the bottom line. DO THE WAIT AT PALACE STATION. Pan Roasts can be amazing if you choose the right place and Sunset Station's Oyster Bar, although decent, is nothing compared to Palace Station's."}
{"text":"I was staying at the Harrah's for a Real Estate conference. It was dinnertime and I had no car so I was stuck with the nearby casino's as dining options. While up in my room, I decided to go downstairs and see what Harrah's had to offer, and hoped they would not be as ridiculously overpriced as most hotel restaurants are (because they know I have no choice).   So the first place I see is the oyster bar and I am sold. You don't have to say oysters twice in order for this fish to bite. I love raw oysters. So I sat down at the bar and opened a menu. The bar seats a handful and there are a few high tables scattered around. No wait or line. I ordered a dozen oysters to myself because I'm crazy like that. I also ordered the jambalaya which was a pretty hearty portion. My co-worker ordered the salad with the shrimp on it and it looked delicious. Everything was cooked well and flavorful. The oysters were kept on a large mound of ice in the middle and was shucked to order. They have several types of oysters and price varies depending on which one you choose. It tasted fresh. The jambalaya was even good the day after as leftovers. The only complaint would be the price but that's average at a hotel/casino where dining is usually overpriced anyways. I would return."}
{"text":"5* 5* 5* clam chowder the best one after Paradise Cove in Malibu beach oysters are to die for I paid a little extra for the smaller version busted this is my favorite spot in Vegas as far as seafood our server had so much knowledge regarding seafood where the Oysters came from and so on , thnx to James he was very knowledgeable very nice person had a smile on and made us welcome anyways I'm going to post couple of pictures"}
{"text":"Great food, poor service. I absolutely loved the shrimp and seafood risotto but the hostess was not at the front the whole time and the waiter seemed to not care about us. I guess I just expected better service for something at this price point. Maybe it was because the server was super busy but I'm not sure."}
{"text":"Excellent Pinot Grigio, crab cakes and seafood risotto for me during the holidays...YUM!"}
{"text":"Had the fra diavolo tonight and can confidently say it was a terrific meal. Flavorful, generous, and fresh.  Terrific service. Reasonably priced. A nice treat on a crummy ole Monday evening. Will definitely return."}
{"text":"Located in the heart of Sunset Station, the self titled Oyster Bar promises a unique Louisiana Creole style dining experience unfamiliar to the Henderson neighborhood of Las Vegas.  After our third time, we still can't get enough!  Although a full dining room is available, the best seats in the house are at the bar top.  The bartenders are also your chefs; definitely adding to the visual appeal.  The drink menu is minimal and wine and beer offerings are basic, but Oyster Bar's true identity comes from their amazing Cajun cuisine.  Our first time there I ordered the Seafood Jambalaya.  It seemed pricey at $20, especially for being at a venue off the strip, but I was assured I wouldn't be disappointed.  After taking my order, the bartender/chef gave me an opportunity to select a level of heat from 1 to 10.  I've always loved places that gave spice level options.  I know I like things a lot spicier than most people and adding spice after the fact just doesn't always do the dish justice.  After I responded with \"8 please\", the chef set to work right in front of our eyes.    All of their dishes are made to order right in front of you.  Not quite hibachi style, but close enough to thoroughly entertain.  After a few minutes, our dishes were set in front of us and I immediately saw where that $20 went!  Having been used to dry, mediocre versions of southern food in Virginia I didn't have too high of expectations - I was proved wrong!  Loaded with lobster, crab, shrimp, mussels, clams and sausage, it amazes me they make any money at all at the $20 price.  Everything was fresh and cooked perfectly!  I remember thinking that the food had to be somewhat decent for the place to be centered in a larger casino.  Decent was definitely an understatement; it was quite possibly the best Jambalaya I've ever had.  The service was great and the ambiance was fitting.  If you're looking for a place to have a great cocktail or something cheap, Oyster Bar is not for you.  However, if great Creole food is what you're in the mood for, outside of New Orleans, I've seen no better!"}
{"text":"Came here for the first time and ordered a dozen oysters which had more pieces of shell and black muck then any sort of flavor. Every bite was like chewing sand. I ordered the salmon which did save the night for me. My friend got the jambalaya and it came out like just like a gumbo. He asked the server but he insisted it was the right thing. This now brings me to the server... He spoke two words to us and they were short and abrupt. The beginning bread basket they served was stale and unappealing. I love sunset station but this place is over priced and not worth my time or money!"}
{"text":"What a yummy and reasonably priced place! Some people I was with said the crab cakes were too salty. Clam Chowder was AMAZING!! Had the Oyster/Seafood for 2 App which was delish.  The flat sesame cracker/bread was sooo good. Wine list was decent. One of my friends had Halibut and said was good. Other had Oysters Rockefeller and said was tasty. My bf said calamari was fabulous. Price for fresh seafood was decent. I liked it!"}
{"text":"My fav oyster place in Nevada! Their jambalaya is seriously the best I've ever had ever in life ever ever"}
{"text":"The food was fantastic! My husband and I came and ate dinner here. We sat at the bar and Dennis served us. The service and food phenomenal! My husband had the seafood risotto and I had the orange glazed salmon. Mmmm. The food was so good and even with drinks it was a decent price for seafood. Come here!!!"}
{"text":"The food is really what earned this 5 stars.  One chef who took our order was subtly rude.  The other one checked up on us well and made very pleasant conversation.  This place was easy to find in Harrah's, and we got very quick service at about 8pm on a Sunday night.  We had the Oysters Rockefeller style (baked with cheese, breadcrumbs, etc.) and they were FANTASTIC.  The seafood risotto was also very well cooked and we got quite a bit more lobster in it than expected for $24.  We will definitely be making a stop in here next year when we go back to Vegas!!"}
{"text":"1. The Oyster Bar is actually more of a lunch counter with a few chairs and tables, and definitely a generic bar theme. It was small but not intimate.  2. It was not busy this Monday late afternoon, early evening. It read \"Seat yourself\" and we did but the staff seemingly ignored us.   3. The service was minimal. An order was taken, food was delivered - there was no intermediate service for refills or asking how our food was or checking in on us, and then the bill. The waiter disappeared on us twice for extended periods in this small place. Once, he was chatting up another waiter with his backed turned to us for several minutes. Another time, the male waiter walked quickly, hands free, right by us - with our two glasses empty, one Pepsi and another water - and didn't bother to look or notice. A second female waiter eventually came by but by then it had been about 10 minutes.   4. Furthermore, when the small complimentary bread was gone, I wanted a little more but then again the waiter did not come by.   5. The price for my Salmon at $22, a dozen oysters at $22, clam chowder at $7, a Cosmopolitan drink at $14, and Pepsi at $3.50 plus tax and tip seemed excessive to us for the quality, portion size and (lack of) service.   6. My Salmon was a little dry but okay. The Asparagus consisted of four stalks and four carrots with some okay rice.   7. I think many of the reviews are valid but some appear to be paid reviews to counter actual negative reviews.  8. On the good side, the oysters were good."}
{"text":"The only reason I'm giving then 4 stars, is because there are better places in this town. If not for those other places, I would give them 5 stars. It's pretty big. I would classify it as casual. I've never seen it crowded, which is interesting, because similar oyster bars are usually packed. The only reason that I can think of, is that it's expensive, but all oyster bars are. The oysters are big and fresh. The New England and Manhatten chowder are good.  The gumbo and cioppino are good. The salads are good. I'm not sure about the desserts. They have oyster shots, and a few beers on tap. It's very clean. I don't know about the service, because I always sit at the bar. Not especially good for children. Service is slow for most oyster bars and they are no exception. But the bottom line is that it does the job."}
{"text":"This is an awesome oyster bar. We started out ordering a mix of a dozen of beausoleil and blonde savage oysters. They were so good that we ordered another dozen. We don't care for the larger oysters so this mix was perfect. The service was excellent and we want to say 'thank you' to Jade for taking care of us. Beer is available in cans and they have several excellent cocktails. The Hurricane cocktail is a must try."}
{"text":"My wife and I came here for lunch on a Thurs around 1pm. The place was easy to find and it was not crowded at all. we sat at the bar so that we could see how the dishes were prepared. We didnt want to eat too much since we had a 630 dinner reservation so we ordered the boullibaise and a dozen grilled oysters and shared.  We didnt get the ob pan roast since the reviews indicated that it was not quite as good as the one at palace station. Food was perfectly cooked and tasted great. The amount of food was also perfect. Only complaint is the oysters were quite small but the taste made up for it. Will definitely go back to try the other oysters."}
{"text":"The line. It's deceiving, because the cookery takes quite a while. Expect an hour, or even two. Yes, really.  Here's a quick tip to help you out:  Pan roast - milky Gumbo - clear, includes okra  And seriously, everything seems pretty good, and the portion sizes of all the soups are huge.  Less positively, I'm not sure the fish & chips are on the menu anymore. As for the raw clams, you can't get them at the moment - Hurricane Harvey destroyed that option for the time being. Sadness.  Now for the bad: the oysters, which they are known for, aren't that great. The quality isn't that fresh, and they don't include the little forks a proper oyster bar should. The forks thing is a minor quibble.  GOOD: all the soup-based foods, larger portion sizes OKAY: long wait, though good things come to those who wait BAD: oysters should be fresher"}
{"text":"Stopped by here because we wanted to gamble and Ruth Chris was completely booked.    Our server was Moon and he was funny and very attentive.  :)  He also got jokes.  What a character.  Thanks Moon for your quick service and jokes.  :)  Food:  OYSTERS ON THE HALF SHELL 1dozen OYSTERS ROCKEFELLER 1/2 dozen BOURBON STREET JAMBALAYA  The food was delicious especially after drinking.  My favorite was the rockefellar and jambalaya.  Bold and full of flavor.    Quick service and yummy food."}
{"text":"Amazing selection of oysters , the wasabi oysters actually worked try them! Try all the different oysters!"}
{"text":"This place was good and I stop by while on business in town.  The varieties of oysters were great and the Bass was good. Service was a little slow and need more work."}
{"text":"One star for terrible food and slow service.   The waiters are not attentive and very slow. It took me three times to get them to acknowledge me. They were not even short staffed. Only 5 tables were occupied.   The food was bland. The risotto was overcooked and fell apart. The jambalaya was bland and had no spice.  Would not recommend."}
{"text":"Decided to start my Vegas trip with the oyster bar called Penazzi. Yes the oyster are fresh with good flavor. The fish bake had no flavor very expensive an small portion. Stick to the oysters. Problem was the service. The waitress was surprised after 15mins we hadn't even been asked our order. Another 20 mins brought my order. Very easy to get a 100.00 bill and walk away hungry. This did include the bar tab in the cost."}
{"text":"The oysters here are some of the freshest I've had in town. The pan roast is awesome...I really recommend that dish. Be careful, they serve it almost scalding hot, but nonetheless it has good flavor!"}
{"text":"After all the great reviews I had read and all the hype about how wonderful the food is, which I'm sure it probably is. I am quite upset that we were never tended to. Our party of five literally sat and waited for 45 minutes after our waters and bread bowl were brought to us, without anyone acknowledging us to take our order. Finally one of us decided to bring this to the attention of the server and someone who appeared to be a supervisor, short older gentleman on this day wearing a yellow woven shirt, just said yeah sure we will have one sent over. We waited yet again. I can see they were getting a bit uneasy, because truth be told we kept eyeing for someone to at least acknowledge and come take our order or to let us know they would be by in a bit. Out of the 3 gentleman, standing, staring at each other I don't believe there was not enough time to stop by and take an order that would have taken less than 2minutes. Also if you have the time to put on some ChapStick then YES! You definitely have time to take a quick order. Needless to say 5 hungry and dissapointed guests that are local and who were really looking forward to trying out the oysters left without ever getting served. 1 person I will mention was Gaby she was really sweet as we sat down. Working in the service and hospitality business this is quite sad to see."}
{"text":"Best kept secret!! The location is far but it's worth the drive for no line or wait.  The oyster shooters seemed to be popular at the bar, but I'll stick to vodka!!  The food can be spicy so beware a 6 is more than above average."}
{"text":"great place great meal great service - very personable waiters and unique experience - fried oysters were excellent"}
{"text":"II ordered the manhattan clam chowder one day for lunch and the next day ordered a crab louis salad.  the food was great. I was in and out fast and back to my convention."}
{"text":"Picked this restaurant on a whim & I was greatly surprised!! We were able to quickly find a seat at the bar which was great because we were starving. The food was very tasty & the service was excellent! Ordered oyster on the half shell & they were AMAZING!!! I've only had oysters once before & I wanted to try it again. They were so so good & just melted in your mouth! I would definitely recommend this place if you want good seafood dishes."}
{"text":"Damn good . Oysters were top notch and the pan roast was awesome. I went for the 6 on their spice scale and was perfect. Little burn but the flavors were on point. Service couldn't be beat either. Highly recommend eating here, you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Bad service: Four requests for a Pepsi? Overcooked Seafood: Mmm. Rubbery mussels, my favorite. Nevermind that they didn't come with proper bread or fries? Jambalaya was \"tomato pastey\" (I ordered the fries. They were good!)"}
{"text":"I have never been to an oyster bar in particular beforehand, so I did not know what to expect of the restaurant settling. When we arrived, it looked like a place where you get in and get out. Nothing fancy smancy.    We were not served oysters at the buffet. Thus, we set out for oysters the following night. We all ordered a dozen small raw  oysters. I ordered mines half raw, half fried. The raw oysters were very fresh and tasted delicious with the usual lemon juice and tabasco/tapatio. YUMMM. They were decent sized. Some were smaller than the average. When my fried oysters came out, they used the medium sized oysters. They were huge. I was not sure how I was gonna finish everything. It came with a nice creamy orangy sauce that tasted like horse radish mixed with thousand island. I am not sure. I cannot identify the taste to be exact. But all you need to know is that it is a good complimentary to the fried oysters. It came with some salad.     Overall, my friends and I were satisfied with the food.     The service on the other hand was a bit slow. We did not come at a busy time, it was moderate. It took awhile for them to take our order."}
{"text":"EXTREME Disappointment. The Oyster Bar at the Texas Casino was empty Sunday afternoon, so we thought the service and food was going to be good. We ordered our food and waited and waited, throughout the time we were there the couple on our left complaint about their food being cold, two ladies on my right also complaint about the service and food, clients continued making complaints to the waiter/waitress and Chef seemed upset . I then noticed a person with a bad knee walked up to get his own napkin, that's how bad service was that evening.   During my observation while waiting and eating dinner, there were a total of eight (8) people that made several complaints. Our food was poorly cooked and service in general was BAD. Overall, the environment felt hostile and unfriendly. \"This was our worst experienced ever\". I WILL NEVER RETURN, and would not recommend this place to anyone.   \"I sure hope that Texas Casino takes these comments under consideration and work on providing a better quality of food and service for their new guests\"."}
{"text":"We wanted to love this place and we will return; I'll start with that. That being said, the mk price Alaskan king crab was shit. We were told by the server they turn over enough that they are not frozen long at all...lie. The king crab was cold, stringy and definitely had that \"frozen\" taste, unfortunately. As usual, I wish we could give half stars because the shrimp cocktail was bomb! I do believe they have GOOD FOOD. We were just either unlucky or they don't serve crab legs fresh enough. For $50 and 1 lb of King crab, we expected better. We will probably return to try other steamer options since it is at a local friendly place and they do seem to serve better options. Stay tuned!!!"}
{"text":"Our family stayed at the Flamingo and walked over to Harrah's to have Oysters. Originally we were just going to get a dozen of oysters but seen the Seafood platter. It was wonderful. It had a little bit of everything.  4 Oysters, 4 Mussels, 4 King Crab legs, 1 lobster, 4 shrimps for $61   We shared between 3 people It was totally worth it and we were full after that.   The customer service was great and all the different hot sauces you get to choose from is pretty awesome."}
{"text":"This place is a diamond in the rough. Let me start by saying they have the best remoulade. I want to buy it to use at home! My favorite thing to order here is the special $9.99(with the purchase of any beverage) fried seafood basket. I always get it with oysters.  It also comes with fries,  coleslaw,  & hush puppies. The oysters are large.  The breading is just right,  not too thick or greasy.   The only downfall of this place is the service. The problem is two fold.  On one hand they are understaffed. The waitresses are spread too thin covering many jobs that would typically be back of the house responsibilities in a restaurant. On the other hand the waitresses themselves are not adequately trained/skilled in working multiple parties at once. That shortcoming ultimately falls on management.  This isn't fine dining, but good flavors and foods for an affordable price."}
{"text":"Thank you Joel for making us a dish that was not on the menu. Everything that we ordered from oysters to salad and great oyster shooters tasted great . The highlights of our night was that Joel hooked us up with a free entree due to a rowdy customer .  If you have a good attitude and you cook good as well , that is all customers like me need . Thank you"}
{"text":"We had just eaten before hitting up the oyster bar but had to come here. We didn't want to miss it during our trip so we planned on ordering half a dozen...but really, half a dozen though? I told my friend I could probably eat two at most since I was so full from lunch. BUT we wanted to try a variety of oysters so we ordered half dozen Oyster Grill which was grilled with parmesan butter ($14) and half dozen Oyster Royale which was raw oysters topped with chive creme fraiche and wasabi caviar ($14). When the oysters came out...Oh-my-God...both were really good. By far the best oysters I have ever eaten. You will know once you come here and try the oysters! I left speechless...it really was a party in my mouth!  Service is excellent! Really nice & friendly staff! Love them!  I will definitely be hitting up the oyster bar again whenever I am in Vegas!! I almost past this up because i had eaten so much right before coming here. I am so glad I came! Do not miss this place when you're in town :D  Oh, they give you a basket of crackers and bread too but I didn't eat those. It looked tasty though! Next time, I'll save room in my belly for the bread/crackers and MORE oysters!"}
{"text":"If you've been to the Oyster Bar at Palace Station, this is the answer to the hour plus line at Palace Station. The one in the Sunset Station Casino in Henderson is 98% as good but a much shorter line, if any. Unlike the Palace Station version that has just 21 seats at a bar, this version has several tables as well and the line is survivable. Had the Signature Pan Roast and it was the outstanding equivalent to the Combo Pan Roast at the Palace Station restaurant. I'll make the drive out to Henderson in a minute to go to this place."}
{"text":"Took 20 mins before anyone even acknowledged us sitting at the bar. The food is good but the service isn't worth the wait. The waitress still hasn't taken my order as I write this review. Terrible service."}
{"text":"This was our first experience with Oysters.  The server was unfriendly, and would not offer us (or any of the three parties that seated near us) advice on what to order when being asked.  They also ran out of the ingredients for oysters that we finally selected to try.  We ended up taking traditional oysters on the half-shell, which were good.  The bacon wrapped shrimp and scallop were DELICIOUS, but the bed of corn they were sitting on was worse than most TV dinners.  I don't know what was going on with the corn... but it was not good."}
{"text":"it's so sad that i have to give this 2 stars. the food is great and ive frequented there quite often, but the last time i was there, the service was absolutely terrible, and the food was eh. they usually give you 6 clams with the linginue and clam sauce. there were none on top. when i asked for them, they gave me a bowl with 6 of them and 4 were empty. i complained to the master chef and he was rude and said \"we are busy!\" that was his excuse!!! i was very disappointed and will not be going back. i'll make it at home myself. dont bother with the sourdough bread they give you. it tastes gross and it's just not good at all."}
{"text":"A dozen oysters for $20 FTW!  This review is strictly for oysters only.   First of all, I love oysters. Hell, I love them so much that I made my bf walk 1 mile down the strip in 103 degree weather JUST so I could eat them. Did I mention that this was right after we finished having lunch too? Yeah, he definitely hated me that day.   At $20 for a dozen or $12 for half dozen, I think this place is a great deal. The oysters are fresh, the servers give you all the condiments to go with it (lemon, horse radish, cocktail sauce, etc) and my entire time there turned into a oyster binge-eating contest all by myself (boyfriend was too full from lunch to join me) Hell, it was so good that the server convinced me to buy another dozen. I still can't believe I spent $40 just eating oysters but oh well.  I wanna say this is this is the best because frankly, I don't know where else they would sell oysters for such a good deal. The half-dozen price is pretty common but the $20 dozen price is what made me love this place.   I'm not a fan of Harrah's but this oyster bar makes me love Harrah's just a little bit more."}
{"text":"Got to try the Oyster bar at hard rock today it was overall really good even the chips they give you as an appetizer. I of course started out with half a dozen Oysters and then I actually finished with the gumbo instead of the popular pan roast I was a little worried at first because it looked a little red and I'm used to a more brown roux in my gumbo but it turned out to taste really good, I truly enjoyed. Other than that I would of gave it 5 stars but I got my gumbo with shrimp and was told it was the same price as the pan roast with shrimp $19 only a dollar more than the usual gumbo but was then shocked at the end to see I was charged a little more than told and no one had the courtesy to tell me until I got the bill not a big deal but I would of liked to atleast be told so I could decide if it was worth the extra $ or not. Overall really good fresh oysters and the gumbo still doesn't beat my favorite which is at palace station but this one was a good runner up. Yummy thanks guys."}
{"text":"Fine if you just want Oysters at an above average price BUT do not order any meals - bland, boring, seriously not enticing. My friend's fish and chips was greasy and tasted worse than long John silver's. my steamed clams were not little necks. Friend's mussels had no wine or garlic in sauce and bouillabaisse - barely a broth it was cooked in. Wrecked my bff's birthday dinner and wayyyy overpriced... Oh well."}
{"text":"I'm So Sick of the Line At Place Station  The Hours At oyster Bar   Sauce is bit different This one more sweet according to chef  sea food  Meat with bone crab Looks  Acts fresh ...  Service Excellent  My water was refilled without notice... Friendly staff Easy Location by LINQ promenade"}
{"text":"Came for a quick dinner.. They're a small restaurant. Limited seating. But worth the wait. The oysters are yummy.. They come on ice with a salsa and garlic sauce & lemons. All shucked and ready to eat.  But I also get a small clam chowder.. Add a Stella and were good to go.."}
{"text":"Closer to a 3.5 star.  They were busy but we were able to sit at the bar.  The bread basket (contains 2 dinner rolls and crackers, as well as butter) was complimentary.    -Shrimp Cocktail: ok -étouffée: was decent, though, the gumbo was better.  Earl asked for lemon wedges to squeeze into this bowl and he said that it tasted better. -Gumbo, combination: this was good.  The combination includes sausage, shrimp and lobster.  I think a bit of creole seasoning would make this bowl of goodness to the next level.  I took half of this to go.    Service was good.  The cooks were very attentive."}
{"text":"We were thrilled with the food! The house bake (with linguini, i hate rice) was awesome! Service was EXTREMELY prompt and polite. We overtipped :) i wish more servers would realize that excellent service = better tips. Well be back - AND bring our friends and family!"}
{"text":"Well I would have liked to try this place, but apparently me and my husband are invisible.  We walked in and sat at a table as the sign said it was a Tuesday night, pretty slow.  I Saw the servers, made eye contact, nodded at a couple of them a few times, the cooks at the bar also saw us and gave us a nod but that was it.  25 min later we left without even seeing a menu.  Too bad, I'm a local and I won't recommend this place to anyone!  They treat their customers badly and ignore them!!!"}
{"text":"I read very ugly views of this restaorante, whenever I've gone to Vegas there I have to visit, it makes me sad that people spend a lot of money on slot machines, and lunch will be expensive all, I ordered lobster 2 days straight and exquisite, my friend ordered oysters and liked too, the service was excellent, and of course we went back for that, would not change a line of expensive lobster for one of lesser quality, for nothing, the restaoante was full and had frequent reservations because people do not want to go to the buffet as they took to the waitresses, and attention is not what you deserve as a customer.                                                    he leido opiniones muy feas de este restaorante,siempre que he ido a las vegas ahi tengo que visitar,me da tristeza que las personas gastan mucho dinero en las maquinas tragaperras,y a la hora de comer les sea caro todo,yo he pedido langosta 2 dias seguidos y exquisito,mi amigo pidio ostras y le gustaron tambien,el servicio fue exelente,y claro que volvimos por eso ,no cambiaria una cola de langosta costosa por una de menor calidad,por nada,el restaoante estuvo lleno  y tenia reservaciones frecuentes,pues las personas no quieren ir al buffet ya que quitaron a las camareras,y la atencion ya no es lo que uno merece como cliente."}
{"text":"One of my favorite spots on Vegas.  Usually the first place we go to after we check in.  And the service was awesome."}
{"text":"Atmosphere was loud and next to a water fall. Service was slow. Seating was not comfortable. I was expecting great New Orleans style food from all the great reviews.  The main dishes tasted like canned food. Horrible!! I would not eat here again for free."}
{"text":"I wanted to eat the pan roast from Palace Station but couldn't wait in line for two hours since I was already starving. I saw this new opening on yelp and that they served pan roast so decided to give it a try and it was inside Hard Rock Hotel which was closer to me.  Came in a little after opening time, the bf and I were the first customers. Seatings are at the bar, maybe about 15 seats. They had two tv screens so we were able to watch the basketball game as well. Complementary homemade potato chips which were awesome. It tastes like sour cream and onion but not 100% sure what the flavor is. Either way, they were delicious.  Fried pickles and oysters ($13): they were so good! The breading wasn't overly battered or soggy but very crunchy, both pickles and oysters. Oysters tasted fresh as well. Comes with a buttermilk caper aioli which was a perfect paring.  Lobster roll ($23): I was surprised of the size, definitely bigger than most places I've tried. The lobster meat was plenty and juicy on top of a bed of lettuce in a grilled buttered roll. The roll was delicious itself. Comes with a side of steak cut fries which weren't too bad either.  All In Pan Roast ($24): I was most excited to try this since it was the main reason why I wanted to come here. Decided for the \"All in\" which had 2 giant shrimps, lobster meat (I think it was just the tail), crab meat, and some fish. Comes with a side of rice. You can pick level of spiciness from 1-5, 5 being the hottest. Opted for level 1 since bf doesn't like too much spicy foods. Even at a level 1 it was pretty spicy. I like spicy and that level was a good amount for me, bf on the other hand couldn't take the heat, poor boy. I even double checked with the waitress if it's a level 1 and she said that's actually just the base since level 1 they don't add any spices. So beware if you're not into spicy since it can be quite hot. Overall, I was a bit disappointed with the pan roast since I was hoping it would taste like the one from Palace Station but it didn't. Still good but not the flavor I was looking for.  Overall, I was pleased with this place, great food and awesome service. Waitress and the chefs were attentive. Bonus points since no wait! Probably since it was early; it did start filling up as we were finishing our meal. I would love to try their other dishes the next time I'm back."}
{"text":"YUM YUM YUM! I'm from New Orleans and seafood was excellent !!!! I'm a seafood snob and loved it! It was pretty neat to sit at the bar and watch cooks make your meal for you!"}
{"text":"Thumbs up to the dozen oysters, which were FRESH!  And the yummy crab cakes that me and my gf devoured!   Everyone working here were so friendly and helpful. I swear when we sat down we had 2 different cooks and servers asked if we've been helped."}
{"text":"I'm a Vegas local and have tried many different locations for oysters on the half shell. Oyster Bar at Harrahs has the freshest around. There's a variety of other seafood dishes on the healthy and heavily fried ends of the spectrum as well. If you're nearby and like seafood I recommend checking it out.  I have never left less than impressed."}
{"text":"The Oyster Bar really isn't bad, but it wasn't to die for either. This Oyster Bar is in Harrah's. So you have to brave a pretty awful smell while you are dining. The air freshener they use in Harrah's is gross.   The oysters we're delicious and fresh. They were the highlight I sampled one from a friend.   The scallop and pasta wasn't bad. I'm sure when drunk it must taste GREAT. But a foodie without a buzz isn't going to enjoy this particular culinary experience. I just hated how I ended up spending close to $60 and could have had the Bacchanal Buffet for that same price."}
{"text":"Price point is roughly $2 an oyster so if you're looking for 1 dollar oysters, well look elsewhere because there's none of that here. BUT!  I do like this oyster bar at Harrah's, what didn't tickle my fancy is the lack of seating in the tiny location as it has to share seating and location with KGB so it's a mix match of seats and high tables, and a small steel divider separates you from the casino floor.  The oysters were on point, the regular pacific west oysters and Kamasuto oysters are delicous. I love me some raw shucked oysters, and any chance I can get to binge on it is A-OK with me!  Definitely get the baked oysters with parmesian cheese, if you're a fan of garlic and cheese, but other than that, the name of the game is raw oysters!"}
{"text":"Horrible. Do not go here. Well at least not in the later hours. The service was HORRIBLE. The food wasn't good. Overall a waste of time and money."}
{"text":"VERDICT: Good clam chowder and decent fish and chips....that is it for what you should order.  We went to Texas Star Oyster Bar at Texas Station again last night.  Greg actually asked me halfway through the meal, \"Why do we keep coming here?\"  Feeling like I was going to vomit later from the food settling in my stomach, I had to reflect.  The good points: 1. It's cool.  It's a fun little, open seafood eatery. 2. The clam chowder is exceptional. 3. The fish and chips are decent. 4.  I assume that if you like raw oysters, that the oyster are good.  I can't vouch for that though, because yuck, raw oysters are disgusting!  The bad points:  1.  The service is slow, especially during the day when there is only one server.  Let me make that clear the slow service is not the servers, but the fact that they like to keep it understaffed.  2.  They're expensive for everything other than what you should order (which is the clam chowder and the fish and chips.) 3.  I had the gumbo.  It was unlike any gumbo I've ever had and filled with some spice that I detest, that usually I only find in bad Chinese food.  It was this spice that made me vomity and push the plate away after a few bites.  Greg insists that it was bad crab.  So maybe bad crab is a spice. 4.  Greg had a boil with shrimp, corn, mussels and clams.  The mussels and clams were sandy.  HELLO?!  Did someone miss cooking 101?  Twenty minutes soaking them live in fresh water is all it takes and all that sand goes away.  Also, the shrimp were overcooked, making them extra chewy.   Four good points and four bad points, I guess it is a wash.  I'll have to try it again.  I just wish they would revisit their menu."}
{"text":"Had dinner here on a Monday night.  Service was fairly slow but friendly.  Fried oysters were not cooked enough and sent back and then came back burnt.   The kicker was asking for water and having it poured in my empty soda glass.  Probably will not be back here."}
{"text":"When a friend brought up hitting the oyster bar at Harrah's, that he saw an ad for on the way in from the airport, I smirked, and thought he was a fool.  I was very pleasantly surprised by my experience.  The cooks double as your service staff and are honest.  And very kind... For being cooks, I was shocked at how nice they actually were.  I guess tips help... If you ask them what's fresh, they give you honest answers - more than any service staff could every dream of, since servers don't handle the product themselves   The oysters we had were great, and fresh.  The clam chowder was one of the best I've ever had. Chunky with clams and potatoes, flavorful, and delicious.   The steamers were awesome.  This place really impressed me, and I will plan on going back when I head into Vegas again - It'll be a great place to drown my sorrows from losing at the tables.  I'll kill my pain with fresh seafood, and white wine.   Also, quite affordable - So yea... Great place to forget those losses"}
{"text":"It was a very busy night tonight. There were multiple tables that were empty but needed to be bussed. My wife and kids and i waited for about 15-20 minutes at the entrance and got no greeting from staff working. There was only a sign that says \"seat yourself\". But as stated above there was no place to sit due to dishes,etc in the Unoccupied table. Finally the hostess from Austin's steak house next door came over and bussed a table for my family and I to sit on. Thank God for Stephanie from Austin's steak house being a good Samaritan and clearing a table for us, who knows how long we would have waited. After we got seated our waitress Sandra was nice and served us promptly and the rest of the meal took about 40 minutes to come out, but we finally got served at 11pm when they were closing ,we arrived at 930pm. The signature pan roast was very flavorful with just right amount of spice."}
{"text":"Signature pan roast is pretty good! The oysters were not so fresh.... =(   I've been coming here for so many years, but the quality of the oysters have been going downhill.... I'll have to find a new gem. Any suggestions?"}
{"text":"Good, fresh seafood...I really enjoyed the pan roast and Manhattan clam chowder. The seafood Cobb salad was delicious. This is my favorite dining option at the Suncoast."}
{"text":"Good food, ehh service. Delicious oysters, especially the Japanese ones. Our waiter forgot one of our meals and apologized and made it up to us with a free delicious dessert. Being a server previously, I can understand--it was just the explanation he gave was hilarious & honest: \"I was totally not paying attention.\"   Expensive, of course as it is an oyster bar on the strip. Very Asian clientele. Touristy. I prefer the Palace station oyster bar's food. Both have great oysters. Dined here twice but wouldn't return."}
{"text":"Good food but...  First, this place is bar seating only. That means this place only has capacity to seat 20 people at a time.  Second, the wait could be long. We went the day after Christmas, a slow season in Vegas. We got to the line at 8pm and got seated at 10:20pm. Third, OK here are the good parts. Lobster is great. Anything with lobster (gumbo, pan roast, or Fa Diabovolo) is worth getting.  It was one of there places where it's good to experience but not a place I would return to. I really wish this place expand to a bigger restaurant so the wait would not be so long."}
{"text":"This place is soooo yummy! Everything I tried was good. I never really had oysters but I don't think i'll eat them anywhere else but here. It's pretty pricey but then again seafood is always expensive. I recommend this place to anyone that likes seafood"}
{"text":"Harrah's Casino! Came here for the Mac King show and was a little hungover/early so my friend and I decided to grab a few drinks here. Sat at the bar and we were promptly greeted from the other side.  What we ordered: 1/2 Oysters - SO fresh and SO good. Watch them shuck them right before your eyes (if you're sitting at the bar that is). Tasted so fresh!! Their horseradish was really REALLY good. It's an oyster bar, MUST HAVE. Bowl of Clam Chowder - This clam chowder was AMAZING. I loved how they put a generous amount of clam... they were huge too!! Perfectly chewy and not overpowering at all. I love how I didn't feel bits of sand like other places...! Bloody Mary - HANDS DOWN THE BEST BLOODY MARY I'VE EVER HAD IN MY LIFE!! And I've had a CRAPTON! Please try!  Service is very quick and prices are fair for Vegas :P Highly recommend this place!"}
{"text":"Not the best oysters or jambalaya Ive have had but it got the job done. The oysters were a little small for my taste. And the broth on the jambalaya was a little too thick. Other than that service was great. Enjoyed the salmon cakes. But nothing really spectacular happened with the food. Just ok... But I was in Vegas its not an easy market to concur."}
{"text":"This place is exemplary. We stopped by for lunch before going to the pool at the hard rock. We had the oysters & lobster taco. The head chef shucked the oysters right in front of us off of ice. The lobster taco was decent enough in size that we shared it. Perfect service & friendly staff. Would come again!"}
{"text":"Went here for dinner .   Calamari was ok  but smaller and not as juicy as some other places so I have to give it 3 stars .  Oyster was good but the ultimate favorite was the Cajun scallops with pasta . Had to put a little salt and pepper on the sauce but ultimately it was very good ."}
{"text":"Went here on the worst possible day (mayweather /McGregor weekend ) on the Sunday. Also went at 6:30 pm after rehab was letting out . Was going to the Australian Pink Floyd show at the joint so we thought it was a good option . The service started it really slow but that can be expected with when we went . The food was actually really good though . We started with some kushi oysters which we lived and came with cocktail sauce and the vinegar sauce . We had to ask for some horseradish . We had the pan roast \"all-in\" which is lobster , shrimp crab and some fish . We got heat level 3 which was basically no heat . We also got some French fries which were some basic steak fries  . They basically copied the idea of the oyster bar At palace station with only bar seats and people standing in line waiting for seats to open . Overall we will be back on a slower day"}
{"text":"\"The World is your oyster....\".   Following a fun week in San Antonio, TX, we moved onto Las Vegas.  I had mentioned to our traveling companion our casual dining plans which included a trip to the Oyster Bar (we usually go to the one at Palace Station) on The Strip.  We're fans of these salt water bi-valve molluscs both raw or cooked as well as the Oyster Bar's famed jacketed steam kettles in which the chefs cook your shellfish pan roast in front of your eyes.  The Oyster Bar has 3 very popular locations in Las Vegas (Palace Station, Sunset Station and Harrah's Casino on The Strip).  Because we didn't rent a car and was too lazy to call a ride share, we chose this location.    Fortunately, when we arrived, the Oyster Bar wasn't crowded at all and has a larger seating area than the other 2 locations.  There wasn't even a line as we just walked in and seated ourselves.  Our server quickly came by with beverage and dinner menus.  He gave us a few minutes to browse both menus as he made his way back with tall glasses of iced water.  During our decision making, I noticed their condiment rack of 6 different hot chile sauces which we could use to spice up our food to our liking.   We ordered Fat Tire beers and a red wine (for our companion) then placed our order for a dozen oysters on the half shell ($30), a basket of flash fried calamari ($14) and the famous O.B.'s Pan Roast ($34).  The menu only offered one type of shellfish pan roast whereas at Palace Station or Sunset Station, you're given more selections.  The cost of food at this site is higher than at PS or SS but for convenience sake, it was worth it.  What can I say about the food flavors and portions?  It was as delicious as we remembered at their sister sites.  Our appetizers that we shared were oysters which were plump, lightly briny and fresh tasting and the \"flash fried\" calamari was lightly breaded and had a crisp exterior over tender calamari rings and tentacles.  We must've been hungry because by the time our main meal (O.B.'s Pan Roast) arrived, which wasn't that long of a wait, we \"wiped\" the two appetizer plates clean!   The O.B.'s Pan roast was filled with mussels, lobster, clams, shrimp and crab claws in a luscious smoked tomato cream sauce with a hint of brandy.  A scoop of jasmine rice was plopped atop all of the shellfish goodness.     By the end of the meal, we were raring to go out and make our \"obligatory deposits\" into those slot machines with hopes of hitting the MegaBucks."}
{"text":"The oysters were good but the service was crappy. There was only one server for the entire place and the server needed more personality. I also ordered a michelada and it was as bland as the server."}
{"text":"everytime we go we get some oysters and oyster shooters in between doing other things. asian bomb is the way to go. intense but fantastic. the guys there are a lot of fun too."}
{"text":"What a delight.  Had modest expectations, but the food was excellent. I had linguine with clams, and the light, white wine sauce had a lemony accent.  My daughter kept stealing off my plate, though she really enjoyed her gnocchi, which were large and plump and clearly homemade.  The wait staff was very friendly and personable, but the service a little slow, so plan to relax.  We had 6PM reservations and had to get out by 7:10 to make it to a show, and we did make it.  Prices were reasonable and we enjoyed a yummy split of champagne that was perfect for the two of us."}
{"text":"My favorite steak 24h i came here over midnight, but food still yummmy, all stuff friendly and smiley"}
{"text":"I'm pretty sad that I had to give this place 2 stars... All the reviews pointed the other way, but I guess we came on a off day. There was only one serve that night, and he had to bust his butt to get out the orders. The chefs and bar tenders did not assist, but rather watched tv as we did all the work. Wait time was 20 min before we got any food. And 10 min just to have our order taken."}
{"text":"Came here twice, once on each visit to Vegas. Oysters are incredibly fresh. You can watch the chefs make their dishes from the counter/bar area where you eat. I used COMP points here both occasions ^^"}
{"text":"We had a great time with amazing seafood and a staff that worked as a team as we had never seen before. The chef was informative and made sure that you were happy with your meal. In fact everything that kept coming out of the kitchen for other guests looked so good we ended up placing more orders.  To top it off we went out of our way to go back the night before we had been scheduled to fly home and the staff and chefs remembered us and pampered us even more.  This is the type of food and service that I would make it a point to return the next time in Las Vegas!!"}
{"text":"Me & my husband were looking for a good place with oysters last night on the strip so we decided to stop in here for dinner. It is really casual as it is in the middle of the casino. The service is good. Our waiter 'Moon' was very nice and attentive.   My review of the food...in one word, just okay. I ordered the shrimp Caesar salad, my husband had the lobster bisque and we had a dozen GRILLED oysters. My shrimp were a little over cooked and there was way too much dressing on my salad. My husband enjoyed his lobster bisque, but as for the grilled oysters...they weren't actually grilled at all. It looked as if someone shucked them, sat them on the grill for about 3 minutes and then brought them to us. The cheese wasn't all the way melted, the oysters was still very raw (which my husband did not like) and it just wasn't what a grilled oyster looks like at all!   Side Note: At one point the drink waiter got tired of our waiter 'Moon' asking him to refill our drinks (we only had one refill) so he filled a tea kettle with Sprite and left it on our table!!!!!!!!!! He said, \"So we could refill it ourselves.\"   Would I go back? Yeah, I would give it another try but I would order just the raw oysters and other items completely different than what we had!"}
{"text":"Fat boy oysters were phenomenal. However, pan roast is not as good as Palace Station. Worth visiting if you're in the area since no waiting compared to PS."}
{"text":"The Oysters are huge and delicious here!!!   4 stars because service is alittle slow, but definitely worth the wait."}
{"text":"Who would have thought that inside a off strip casino in Henderson lies a hidden \"pearl\"!  Okay no more puns, but when I feel like treating myself to some Cajun styled seafood this place hits the top of my list.  I've heard it's like the one in Palace Station, but not as busy.  As the name indicates it is an oyster bar, so it's a bit small. Not recommended for large groups, but perfect for dinner with a few friends.  Top items I like to order is the Cajun Style Peel and Eat Shrimp, as well as the Signature Pan Roast!  I like mines spicy, and boy they deliver on the spice!  So order accordingly!  Pan roast is served with rice, perfect to soak in all the flavors.  I've also tried the Cioppino, which was good, but keep going back to the Pan Roast. They also have Fresh Oysters daily, ask you server for their selection.  I've been happy that times that I have order them.  I've never made it to a point where I had room for dessert, so I can't review that, if I had room I would probably eat more oysters!  Overall, I love eating here.  I wish Pan Roast was considered diet food, I'd be set!  Service is usually pretty quick.  I can't wait till my next visit!  Maybe one day I'll try some other menu items, but it's hard to steer clear from a sure thing!"}
{"text":"Came here for my sisters birthday, and it's one of her go to's  The oysters are very fresh, it is farm raised so it's very clean and doesn't have that sea smell  Gumbo- not so good, very bland and just not taste ful  Seafood risotto was omg really really good! So tasteful and flavorful  But the shrimp was a little old and it has an awe full smell to it   The mojito was awful  Service was good"}
{"text":"Great place to belly up to the bar when all the restaurants are full.  If you are lucky you can just jump in a seat like I did.  The kitchen is open and you can see all the food being cooked right in front of you.  Sitting at the bar you also had access to the latest sports game on the screen.  The bartender/waiter was great too.  He was prompt, attentive and kind even though he was soooo busy!    Food was good - bread was great, crunchy!  And I had a wonderful salad with shrimp that I made on special request that they had no problem making for me.    I would go back!  It's in the middle of Harrahs but once you are inside you would not remember you were in the casino."}
{"text":"We love this place the food is always so good. But will say we were so grossed out last night when we were done eating our amazing dinner we were watching the employees and the guy that finished taking our money and placing it in the cash register had gloves on and when he was done he went right over without changing the glove and started to shucking oysters. That is gross!!! Those poor ppl that ate those after he touched money.  So I gave a 2 star bc the food was good but as a manager at a bank and know just how gross money is and the fact that man never changed his gloves really grosses me out and don't think i will ever go there again."}
{"text":"This place is not crowded which I love and their oysters are ooo so yum.  The waiter said they had two types of oysters and for some reason \"Asian people\" like the \"Fanny Bay Oysters\" compared to the \"Blue Point Oysters.\"  I then proceed to ask him why he said \"Fanny Bay has a fishier taste to it.\"  I ordered the \"Fanny Bay Oysters\" and I'm glad I did.    Things you should expect:  Don't expect a 5 star oyster bar.  It's a laid back oyster bar and the only thing we recommend are the following:  -Clam Chowder : Rich and creamy filled with clams. -Steamed Little Neck Clams: The broth is buttery and has herbs -Oysters:  You're not going to get full off of them so order a dozen per person. -Calamari:  Make sure to ask them to do it WELL DONE or EXTRA Crispy.  They are the best when they are extra done.  If you don't tell them that they'll come out a little soft.  If you want a quick fix JUST for oyster and a snack come here to eat or grab a bite.  Don't come here looking for a 5 star feast."}
{"text":"The Oyster Bar at Harrah's has now become my go-to first night in town dinner.  The flights I get into Vegas often bring me in around 9:30pm... so with taxi travel and check-in time, I'm often now hitting the Strip until 10:30pm... AND then the hunger kicks in!  But what's open?  All the nice sit down places are usually closed at this point, but wait...  The Oyster Bar is open until 1am!  Problem solved.  :)  Not an Oyster fan?  Don't worry!  They have plenty of different seafood options as well as steaks, etc.    I've have the Mussels Fra Diavolo and the grilled Lobster tail.  YUM!  They also have a pretty decent wine list to go along with their food options.  Another plus is that it is self-seating.  You just walk in and plop yourself down and find something delicious.  I suggest sitting at the \"bar\" for the fastest service."}
{"text":"We have eaten at this restaurant for many years. We always split the Pan Roast. It's always so good we order it every time. We went last night we saw something new on the menu. The Sunset Roast. Very similar to the pan but with no lobster, add chicken and andouille sausage. WOW. Our new favorite. We like to sit at the bar and enjoy the wonder aromas of the dishes being created. We sat by Raul. That guy works!  It looked like he had four pots going at once and he didn't skip a beat. He even had time to ask us how our meal was. We've eaten at GVR's \"Tides\" and it doesn't compare to the Ouster Bar. My rating should be a 4-1/2. The only complaint is it usually takes a little longer to get waited in and to get the check than other restaurants. Don't get me wrong, the food is worth the wait but it you're going to catch a movie, give yourself some extra time. Or, the clam chowder is amazing."}
{"text":"It's been a long while since I've been to the Oyster Bar at Harrah's.  I went here with my mom when she decided to eat here since she was playing slots over at Harrah's.  The last time I was here I had their jambalaya which was pretty good.  This time I was curious to try their pan roast since I loved the one over at Palace Station, so we ordered the Pan Roast for two.  O.B. Pan Roast (for two) -- http://bit.ly/2lfVazi Lobster, shrimp, crab claws, clams and mussels, smoked tomato cream sauce and jasmine rice.  It's just a ton of seafood awesomeness.  Though it was lacking in the rice department.  We had to pay $5 for an extra bowl of rice.  I have to say though, in comparison to the \"Bouill-Roast\" at Palace Station, it's good, but not as great as the pan roast at Palace Station.  However, you can't complain with the huge amount of seafood that they put in.  My mom and I barely finished it, with me finishing off most of it.  Overall, the Oyster Bar at Harrah's is still a decent spot.  My mom and I were pretty satisfied with their pan roast for two.  I guess if you can't make it out to Palace Station's Oyster Bar, this is actually the next best thing."}
{"text":"I've had two completely different experiences at this place.  FIRST experience- the Hispanic waiter was rude. It seems as though he hates his job! Lol. I think he is also the cook for the panroast too. Anyways, it took him forever to get our water. The clam chowder also looked strange.... more pink than white. We ordered a dozen oysters as well and those were delicious.  SECOND experience- our waiter was Asian this time. Very prompt on our order and water. I tried the Caesar Salad this time and it was yummy. The clam chowder tasted A LOT better this time around- white, creamy, full of clams. The waiter also talked to us and recommended the Kusshi oyster and actually let us sample two different kinds of oysters. Needless to say, we ordered an extra dozen Kusshi oysters. Friendly service and samples= happy customers who order more food."}
{"text":"This place sucks, if you like FRESH seafood DONT COME HERE. And watch out for the grumpy old waiterif you like your shrimp cocktail smelly like an old lady then you might like this place on a serious note.... worst seafood ever!!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"Better than expected! They had big fresh oysters which was surprising since its in the middle of the desert. Ask for blue pointe oysters. The crab cakes, clams with white wine sauce and the Cajun scallop pasta were all amazing."}
{"text":"My favorite place to eat when I'm in Vegas! I know, I know... there are so many famous & fabulous eateries in Las Vegas, especially near The Strip. But the Oyster Bar makes the most amazing Cajun Pan Roast with lobster, shrimp and crab in a brandy, cream, tomato base - I'm always craving it and haven't found anyone who can duplicate it! That's why the Oyster Bar has my heart. And my stomach.  Yes, it's inside of Sunset Station - which is actually a really nice casino. The Oyster Bar also has a great wine and craft beer selection. And fresh Oysters flown in daily, in addition to a ton of fresh seafood that they prepare in amazing ways.  The service is always great and having the open kitchen where we can see our meal prep in action and get to talk to our servers enhances the experience.  Next time you want some really fresh seafood and some amazing Cajun culinary feast - give the Oyster Bar a try!"}
{"text":"Yesterday me and my family went to eat at this oyster bar restaurant, because we had a celebration dinner from the total rewards!! $100 worth Unfortunately all my family members GOT SICK from their famous Oysters. It's sad that place get great reviews but very very poor service! I try calling the restaurant 20 times in a row no one answered it just straight to voicemail!! So I call the front desk and the police to file a claim about how this restaurant handles their food!! My whole entire family members got food poisoning! Never Ever coming here again!! Its sad to show that the Las Vegas got terrible restaurants!! I'm sure how many other people that came to this restaurant suffer from food poisoning. But I'm just one average person that said something about their food handling!! Very disappointed to know the people that is working there the staff doesn't take any responsibility for this kind of situation so I have to take into my own actions and do something about it because this isn't fair to anyone!!! Hopefully this help to rethink about coming to this restaurant!!"}
{"text":"We found the Oyster Bar through Yelp and it certainly lived up to the positive reviews.  We liked it so much, in fact, that we had dinner here twice over our Vegas weekend trip.  Where do I start?  The oysters on the rocks are incredibly fresh and at only $20 a dozen, it doesn't get much better than that.  The crab cakes are absolutely delicious and the calamari was crisp on the outside and tender to the bite.  The bouillabaisse is loaded with fresh lobster, scallops, jumbo prawns, mussels, and clams and is simmered in a rich, saffron-infused broth.  The jambalaya pasta had a creamy, smoky, flavorful sauce and was generously tossed with chicken, sausage, and jumbo prawns.  The grilled king crab legs were phenomenal.  They were served hot and coated in a buttery glaze of seasonings and spices and served with drawn butter and lemon wedges.  The wait staff is great too.  Our waitresses on both occasions were friendly, accommodating, and attentive.  I've been visiting Las Vegas twice a year for the past 8 years already and I've paid anywhere from 2 figures to 4 figures for meals depending on where I wish to dine.  I'd have to say that the Oyster Bar has been one of the better dining experiences I've had without costing me an arm and a leg.  It makes me wonder if some of those haute cuisine venues are simply full of overpriced pretension.  *note* Although the Oyster Bar is adjacent to Penazzi, they're actually 2 different restaurants.  The Oyster Bar does not take reservations, it's first come first serve and you seat yourself.  (which isn't as bad as it sounds, it was never overcrowded and we never had to wrestle for seating)  The Oyster Bar and Penazzi also have independent menus, so don't make the mistake of making a reservation at Penazzi thinking you can order items from the Oyster Bar.  Some of the other reviews are confusing in that aspect and I wanted to clarify because my family and I nearly commited that blunder."}
{"text":"One of the best little finds in Vegas! The dozen oysters and seafood risotto was delicious. Honestly though even though the food was amazing the customer service was the best around and an all around 5 star!"}
{"text":"Who goes to a desert to order seafood???  Well, lesson learned. Oysters and calamari were the smallest ive ever had. Food was expensive. Service was severely lacking. We sat at the bar and got ignored. Anytime we needed anything it was like we were asking for the greatest inconvenience.   Not worth the walk or the money."}
{"text":"When in Vegas, this place is a must visit. The staff is great. Always treated top notch by Jackie, Ramondi, and Lindsay. Oysters are fantastic whether raw, grilled or fried. Tiger prawn shrimp are the best. I've been stopping by here for lunch, dinner, or drinks for several years."}
{"text":"Best oyster bar I've been to in Las Vegas, I have been to the one in south point and its to me not as good. I feel as if the shrimp is more fresh and the fish is good. Price is fair and good service. Sat under the waterfall it's nice."}
{"text":"This is exactly what the Hard Rock needed. Fresh, modern and just really good! We had the tuna tacos, calamari fries and shrimp & grits. All was above expectations. This place in a short amount of time has surpassed all other oyster bars in my opinion. We will definitely be returning very soon. Good job Hard Rock. You got this one right!"}
{"text":"The oysters here are definitely good and I even got my gf to try some for the first time and she loved it. The ambience though is a little stale with not much interaction with servers or anything to look at besides people playing the slots. Doesn't bother me much, but it does help a restaurant with high price points to provide some sort of background music to over power the slots and maybe a few flat screens around to keep your guests entertained, even the ones that come to dine in solo. Our server was very quick and certainly did his job just serving, but didnt try to sell or up sell us on anything or educate us on what type of oysters they had and what would be best. It is very pricey of course, for about $22 you will get half a dozen of half shelled oysters which are not huge in size. I also order a side of fries which sucked. It was seasoned, but the freshness of the fries was not there. I could immediately tell it had been sitting out in a bowl for a while until someone like myself ordered some. Because of that, the fries were stale and had no crunch. I also ordered one oyster shooter for about $8 which was good, but ive had better at a better price in San Diego. Overall, its a good starting point to try some oysters but it wouldn't be my go to based on prices and ambience."}
{"text":"I love oysters but this is the worse OYSTER BAR IN vegas. HORRIBLE AND SLOW SERVICE. Been here 3 different times when I visited Vegas and I thought the service would be better. First visit, we sat at a table. Sat for maybe almost 15 minutes and no one came by to take our order or even bring us water. So my husband asked the waiter to help us and the waiter quickly told us to just go sit at the bar because they will assist you better. Well why couldn't he have told us all those time we were waiting? So We went to the bar area. Finally got our order in. Honestly their food is really good here and I think I would come back despite the horrible service.  2nd visit, we just went straight to the bar area and order some oysters to eat and have some drinks. We didn't have to deal with the wait but the service was still crappy.  3rd visit, we went with a few of our friends. We each ordered appetizers and entrees. Appetizers of course came out first. Calamari was nasty here. Then our entrees  very slowly came out one by one. The waiter never came by to give the status on my order. I ordered pasta and my friend had steak and the steak came out first. 20 minutes passed by and my friends had finished their food and everyone was ready to leave and then my pasta finally came out. Instead of having my friends wait for me, I asked if he could box it up or just cancel my order because honestly I thought they had forgot my food anyways. The waiter walked away pissed off and came back with a box and an attitude. LOL. Places like this don't deserve any tips from me. There was no apology or anything.   Even with my bad experiences here, I am certain I will come back for their yummy food."}
{"text":"This spot at Hard Rock has the best pan roast I've ever had!! Service is nice. Oysters are shucked fresh in front of us.  Been here twice, always delicious, can't wait to go back again!"}
{"text":"Always wanted to try the oyster bar at Palace station but the line is always sooooo long... I'm talking two hours long. & they don't have a waiting area, you just have to kinda stand in line till you're next. Anyways went to Sunset station to go bowling & needed dinner afterwards. There was no wait. Walk in, seat yourself. We were greeted about 5 mins after we sat. Which we didn't mind because we were looking at the menu. We got a dozen charbroiled oysters... very tiny, but good! I ordered the pan roast with crab, lobster & shrimp with a side of rice. My boyfriend ordered a shrimp pasta with red sauce. It was all sooooo good. The pan roast was very rich. Luckily the rice helped, I also squeezed some lemon for acidity & pepper. I got it spicy level 4... probably could have gotten a 6! Overall very good food."}
{"text":"I've been to this place several times and I always enjoyed it until my last visit there. This place has the WORST service ever. We sat down at the bar around midnight and we were ready to spend some money. Wow... Where do I even begin with thr service.. Trent was the worst server I have ever had in my life. I asked him for our bread after waiting for about 10 minutes. He completely ignored me and then later came wuth the bread without saying a word. I then asked him if they had pan roast available. He said \"uhhhh pan roast.....alright....\" and then went off again. I assumed that he put our order in. 15 mins later I asked him nicely if our pan roast was coming out and then he replies \"uhhh... The pan roast.... Uhhhh\" and then he just dissapears again!! Unbelievable... At this point, my boyfriend and I are so annoyed that we immediately ask for our check for the oysters we ordered from a different server.. And guess what?? He ignores us again. -_- Finally we yell at him for the check and when he came out with the check I gave him my players card and asked him for my discount. He then starts complaining about how he needs to go back and redo the whole check. SO FKN WHAT?!! wow we were so fed up at this point, we let him have it. We pretty much told him he was the worst server ever and how we would never come back. The worst dining experience ever... Go to the oyster bar at Palace Station. The drive is well worth it, the food and service is a million times better than this.  This place should get 0 stars for its crappy service but I'm being nice by taking the food into consideration so they get a regretful 2 stars in my book."}
{"text":"Lobster bisque was good. Dozen grilled oysters were good but some were under cooked. Service was fast but Moon left every plate on the table till we left. Barely room to eat. Water served without ice and empty water glass left unattended for too long. He even argued with my wife. Won't go back. Not $$. Should be rated $$$$."}
{"text":"Every time I come to Vegas (which is frequently for work) I always try and find the out of the way the little hot spot the locals go. However... I make it a point at least once each time to hit this place. The staff/chefs are always fun and friendly! (Dennis was great tonight). The food is outstanding (and yes, I have a refined palette) for the price. Tonight, Oysters Royale (never miss it) some blackened (for you NOLA folk not the same but great) shrimp and Pan Roast. I've never been disappointed and never expect to be! Skip Emil's. This is the place for great food and company."}
{"text":"For those who liked COOKED oysters this is the place to come! This place is not the same oyster bar at palace station, completely different with some of the same and different menu items.  First difference I noticed that there was not long line like the one in the palace station. More tables & more seats at the bar so we were able to seat ourselves. The restaurant is run by one waiter & one bus boy, it works out pretty well considering the size of the place.  Oyster bar means oysters, raw & cooked. I'm not a fan of raw oysters so we got the oysters Rockefeller & fried oysters. The Rockefeller was sooo tasty, the cheese was melted just right on top the oyster, and of course the fried oyster was well... everything tastes better fried.   For entree I got the shrimp jambalaya. It was a generous portion of rice, ham & sausage topped with shrimp. I also got to taste the ciopinno. It was very soupy, no rice included, but a larger portion or seafood.   Overall, I would recommend this place if you're staying on the strip, not as busy as other oyster bars off the strip.   You might have to flag down the waiter a couple times as he scrambles to tend to the entire restaurant, but he doesn't seem to mind!"}
{"text":"Located inside Sunset Station.  This location provides more seating than the other location.  Went here for lunch with a group.  Seat yourself.  Complimentary bread.  The charbroiled oysters were unavailable today.  Our table tried the pan roast with seafood which the broth is absolutely amazing! The flavors are super tasty and the seafood with the sauce melts in your mouth.  The salmon dish was prepared well and the sauce with okra pieces complimented the fish.  Staff were very friendly and efficient."}
{"text":"We went to Harrah's oyster bar thinking it was the oyster bar at the palace.  This uninspired place charges you quite a bit for the disappointing food it offers.  They only managed to not up screw the simple chips and fish dish.  The restaurant is open air to the casino so you will get the cigarette air and other loud sounds coming from the gambling floor."}
{"text":"I went to a movie at Santa Fe Station and on the way out discovered the Oyster Bar.  It is an upscale place that seems a cut above most of the other similar places.  I had an excellent shrimp dish.  The prices are very fair for both food and wine.   I would have given them 4 stars if they has warned that they dial up the spice level on my dinner.   I plan on going back soon because I think it is a 4 star place and I want to confirm that before I change my rating."}
{"text":"A new entry into the Oyster Bar scene is the Oyster Bar at the Hard Rock Hotel.  This is probably the most beautiful of all the Oyster Bars, and with brand new cooking pots it really is comfortable to eat there.   I especially appreciate that they have a very nice wine by the glass program. Many restaurants deprive their guests of decent wine when they order by the glass. The bar manager usually does not understand what the wine drinker wants and so buys some very cheap off-brand and marks the price way up.  I am happy to report that the Oyster Bar has pretty good wine by the glass at reasonable prices.   Last night I had the shrimp scampi with home made linguini. The shrimp were very fresh and the pasta was perfectly cooked and delicious."}
{"text":"Always enjoy eating at this place.  Love the seafood gumbo and the jambalaya. The wait is never too long, and sitting at the bar will get you served faster."}
{"text":"Excellent little place.  Don't skip this for the cheap place next door. Lobster bisque was yummy. Boyfriend had Alfredo he loved. I had the seafood pasta dish that was spicy. Geez I can't believe I forgot the name but it had mussels, clams, calimari, and shrimp with a spicy read sauce.  Just the right spice."}
{"text":"I walked a mile in heel and 110 degrees for you! WHY OH WHY did you take Cioppino and the oyster shooters off the menu! WHY!!!!!!!!!!!!! Curls up in a ball and cries! I came all the way from San Francisco for you! Why would you do that to me! WHY! I'm taking off a star for that! Once i expressed my devastation to the waiter about the oyster shooters he, sympathized and went to the kitchen and had them made for me 2 for 5 bucks. Not bad considering they cost like 4 or 6 bucks each last time. So I'm adding half a star back!   I give you a 4 1/2 stars!"}
{"text":"I highly recommend dining here! The shrimp Louie was to die for! The portion s size was great and the service was exceptional! I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"First of all, really decent prices for the strip. Not extremely break a hole in my pocket expensive but definitely not cheap either. C'mon now, you're on the strip and you know what to expect people!  We had a little trouble finding this BAR hiding in Harrah's casino. It's an actual bar where you seat yourself. The tables are really small and the plates are all huge = problem.  We sat down on a round bar table near the bar/entrance and a waitress came over in about 1 minute. NICE! She was definitely helpful and extremely friendly, good service. There was 4 of us, all guys and two of us already had beers so we were sippin' a little bit already and were looking to continue our buzz!   We both got the Oyster shooter, comes with a double shot of Patron or Grey Goose and half-dozen fresh half-shell oysters. Of course we got Patron, and our waitress even noted that they dose a little bit of Patron on each Oyster too! Maybe that's what made it so good!!! They were extremely cold served on the bed of ice and tobasco/cocktail sauce and lemon!!! Extremely delicious!! Can you say \"Gone in 60 seconds!?!\" And the shot of Patron was huge, the only bad thing was that only 2 out of 4 of us were a lil drunk by the end of dinner.  We also got the Crab Cakes and Calamari. The crab cakes were good, very meaty and full of crab meat. I would've liked them to be a little fluffier but they weren't bad. Nothing outstanding either... the siracha aioli was delicious though, and the spring mix salad it was served on was gone in seconds. The Calamari was really good!!! Extremely crisp and good pieces, came out in a good sized fryer basket and there was even leftovers, after 4 guys dugg in on it!  Our friends ordered some type of Clam Pasta and Halibut with Risotto, they said it was okay...  All in all really enjoyed the visit here, definitely will return next time we're all in Vegas!"}
{"text":"Went here for lunch on two consecutive days and sat at the bar.   The first day during the NFL playoffs on Sunday, I ordered the salmon. It was well above average in taste and cooked correctly. In my opinion it was about a 10 oz filet grilled and seasoned perfectly.  The second day arrived right at opening, 12 noon on Sunday. The restaurant immediately filled up to at least half capacity during my hour that I ate. I ordered 1 dozen grilled oysters and 1 lb of blackened shrimp at the recommendation of food server Raymundo.  He advised me that that was a lot of food, but for I believe $6 more than the 1/2 lb shrimp (the menu prices have changed), this was well worth it.  The shrimp were very large and I received about 24 pcs of shrimp if not more in the 1 lb. These shrimp are not tiger shrimp, so don't expect something exotic. The seasoning was perfect, and was tasted through the shrimp peelings. Be careful, this dish is served hot, so I would wait at least a couple of minutes before peeling your first shrimp. For those who like shrimp headless, these come headless, but not de-veined.  As for the grilled oysters, they were served just after the shrimp and I'd say it was well worth it. The caveat is that I've been to New Orleans, and these unfortunately don't come close to Acme Oyster House chargrilled oysters. These oysters were good and were medium to large in size. The oysters used for grilling are not the same ones usually served cold.  As for service, I'd say it was good considering there was only one food server allotted for the dining tables and one for the bar area.  I'd recommend this place to anyone looking for a seafood fix that isn't sushi. All the food is fresh and cooked with flavor."}
{"text":"Fresh oysters...a quick snack in Las Vegas...  Located inside Harrahs, on The Strip, this Oyster Bar has many seating options - high tops, regular tables, and counter.  We chose a regular table and were served right away.  We got a dozen fresh oysters which were nice and plump!  The lemon juice and cocktail sauce made the taste pop!  Mmm!  This was a great snack on the way to riding the High Roller.  It was really convenient and we didn't have to wait like the Palace Station location which only has 18 seats!"}
{"text":"Before I start the menu on Yelp is outdated; everything now $1-4 more than it was.  The place is inside the Linq, in the back of the casino.   The service is existent. However, it's not the most attentive or qualitative: takes a bit to be seated, drinks are smacked down in front. The person serving us was kinda like \"what do you want?\" and did the same to the older gentleman next to us.  The food was average. Free bread and butter with your meal: the bread was a little overdone but good still, the butter was plain, NOT the more flavourful honey butter.   We all ordered the clam chowder with the bread bowl: chowder was good, veggies and clam were noticeably tasty, bread was toasted well. However it was 25% chowder and 75%. The bread bowl wasn't dug out completely. So you're pretty much paying $13 bucks for bread.   Overall, average service, average meal, but 2 stars for the scamming my chowder and the tobacco-filled atmosphere"}
{"text":"Looking for the best oysters on the strip without driving, this spot is the best. Small, but reasonably priced for the quality."}
{"text":"Came to have dinner here last night with my lady, we ordered the half dozen half shell oysters and the clam chowder. We sat at the bar table and almost instantly the waitress came and greeted us with iced water with a lemon wedge and buns, which were delicious by the way, we never saw her after that though. A couple of minutes later a cook came by to take our order. The clam chowder came out I a matter of minutes. The clam chowder was truly phenomenal. The texture was amazing and it was rich and full of flavor. We never got tired, or overwhelmed by the taste. The half shell oysters came out six minutes later and we were excited to try them, as the clam chowder was so amazing. Unfortunately the oysters left us disappointed. The were bland of taste and the texture was extremely mucous like. There were lots of small bits of the shell mixed with the oyster itself making the experience very unpleasant. Half the time we were picking out small bits of shell out from between our teeth. Extremely disappointed with this place. One would think that because it is an OYSTER BAR the oysters would be the damn near perfect, but that is unfortunately not the case. The clam chowder on the other hand, 10/10"}
{"text":"Always amazing food and service. Honestly the whole team is amazing. They remember me when I come and already know what I'm going to order. It's those little things that make you feel welcome. Thanks guys!"}
{"text":"Honestly if I had to write this review before my last visit to the Oyster bar I would've given them a four star but my last visit was so disappointing that I decided to write this review and give it a really low score because it was absolutely horrible my  husband and I sat at the bar the place was busy and we understand that things are not going to be 100% we have been customers of the oyster bar for at least 12 years living in Henderson we have  seen some of our favorite restaurants slowly go from bad to worse but this place just took a dive into a ditch overnight... food was horrible service I couldn't even express how unprofessional attitude roll the eyes ignoring the customer not refilling the drinks not checking to make sure if our food was good bottom line the chef server whoever he is that waited on us that night probably was having a Bad day and decided to take it out on the customer. Honestly I really hope that management or the owners of this place can take a second look and begin to analyze what's been going wrong so we get to enjoy our favorite restaurant the way used to."}
{"text":"Fantastic oysters and a really nice crab louie salad.  Service was a bit off on my visit - and the place could stand an update.   Really - who care the food is fresh and delicious."}
{"text":"Very fresh seafood and reasonably priced (on the strip) don't be afraid of Harrah's! Give this place a try. It's open late;)"}
{"text":"ZERO STARS!!! Walked 1.8 miles to check this place out only to arrive at 10:07 and they're closed. Hours say they close at 11. YAY."}
{"text":"Buenísimo lugar... muy amables los que atienden y todo bien fresco!! 100% recomendado  Esta un poco escondido pero pero vale la pena"}
{"text":"I came here to try oysters for the first time. They were running a special that for every half a dozen oysters you order you would receive a free glass of house wine, so it was a bonus. We ordered the Oysters Rockefeller because my boyfriend thought it would be best for me to try them baked due to my sensitive palate. The way they fixed them up was good, but I couldn't get past the texture of the actual oysters. It had nothing to do with how they were made, I just don't like oysters I guess. My boyfriend happily devoured both plates and I indulged in the best basket of crab cakes and fries I have ever had. They were absolutely delicious. I will definitely be back for more."}
{"text":"Are working our way through the menu and have thoroughly enjoyed each and every item.  Judicious use of garlic and seasoning with a light hand on the salt.  Pasta always al dente and the seafood couldn't be fresher.  Service is friendly, and makes an effort to remember you and treat your return with enthusiasm. All that and reasonable prices too.  Favourite server = Pam - she's a delight."}
{"text":"Couldn't find this on Yelp so I actually went out of my way to add it so I could post a bad review.  I will usually give a place the 3 strikes rule before vowing never to return, well when you get 3 strikes in one visit, I don't think it even warrants trying for more.  I will say I have been here a few times in the past and although not the best Oyster Bar in town, it was OK and close to home.  Was in the mood for seafood, specifically crab legs...went on the website and low and behold there was special on legs.  Get there at 5:30, no crowd, maybe 4 tables.  No hostess, ok guess that is the norm for mid week.  Printed menu was completely different from what was on the web and changed since past visits - STRIKE ONE  Ok let me get a beer to calm the nerves cause I got in-laws in our party of six, I already called out the first strike and where the hell is our waitress.  Guess the party of 6 scared her off.  I proceed to order a micro brew from the menu and was sitting patiently.  After everyone gets their drinks someone I expect to be the sit in F&B manager (he looked the part) came by to tell me the micro brew is no longer served her, was just a temporary thing for football season.  Well shucks here I am watching some Basketball thinking I should have know football season was over and wouldn't have bothered ordering it off the menu you printed and not bothered changing for 2 months now, I know the economy is bad but a $2 sharpie could have save you here - STRIKE TWO  Utterly distraught now I don't even know what to order - settled for the Lobster Fra Diavolo which I hope will recover a meal which in my mind was already headed for a 2 star on Yelp no matter how spectacular the meal would be.  I am no Oyster Bar expert and I would find it a challenge to put together a good gumbo or pan roast but I know seafood.  So when you bring me a bowl of linguine noodles with a can of crushed tomatoes thrown in and toss in some par boiled - not even fully cooked slivers of lobster I'm going to complain.  I can't remember the last time I sent a dish back but I can tell you before the last meal was brought out of the kitchen mine was going to opposite direction.  The waitress was nice enough to offer to have them cook the lobster more but in my mind not even satan himself could bring the Fra Diavolo (brother devil) to an acceptable level - there was no lobster, the sauce was no here near spicy then only thing not messed up was the linguine. -STRIKE THREE AND WE ARE OUTTA HERE."}
{"text":"TL:DR: Decent food, but not worth it for the price tag.   We went there well before the dinner rush, and ordered fresh oysters, Manhattan seafood chowder, clams, surf & turf (king crab instead of lobster for $7 extra) and a sea bass special that was recommended by our waiter (not on the menu).  Appetizer:  The oyster is quite fresh, a nice start to our meal. However, when the seafood chowder is served, we were disappointed. The taste of the soup was really salty and overly saucy. I did not enjoy it at all. I had to chug water down after.   Entree: 1. Surf & Turf The steak is rather small (feels a little less than 4 oz.), and there's nothing special about it. It's just a classic filet mignon without any sauces. The steak was not rested for long enough before serving, so the juice was actually spilling out when it was served.  We substituted the king crab legs instead of lobsters, and there is nothing special about it. It's mediocre at best.   The sides (carrots & asparagus) are decent, but a bit on the greasy side.  2. Sea Bass  The fish is slightly over cooked, but the portion size is one fish. In my honest opinion, I don't think it's worth the price tag, but it is a nice change from the regular fish one can usually get served in a restaurant.   Post Entree Side: Clam cooked in white sauce It was quite delicious, but the portion size isn't overly big, so not quite worth the price in my opinion."}
{"text":"A must visit every time I am in Las Vegas.  My favorite picks are the Shrimp bruschetta, Alaskan salmon, calamari, and clam chowder.  Oysters in a half shell all day.  Chef Joel, you are the best amigo.  Keep up the good work.  Mucho gracias!!!"}
{"text":"Having been to the location at Palace Station, I knew what to expect for the flavors and quality of the food, and boy, was I NOT disappointed! The freshness of the oysters is undisputed, and the cioppino (my first time ordering it--I usually get the pan roast) was divine! You even get a sweet little bowl of rice on the side so that the cioppino doesn't get mixed with it like the pan roast can do.  So why the 3 stars, you ask? Simply, the service. When I went in on a busy Sunday evening, there were a couple of places at the bar that were empty but had piles of dishes on them, waiting to be cleaned. (Understandable, but at Palace Station, these are cleaned up almost immediately.) I sat in the one empty, clear seat, and looked over the menu. I placed my order for oysters and cioppino and read while I waited. While I understand that the staff were extra busy at that moment (it seems like they had 5 different patrons, including myself, order a dozen oysters), bringing beverages and the rolls should have happened within my first few minutes of sitting down. The gentleman beside me kept having to wait for his beverage to be refilled, and then he sat there for ages waiting to pay. When his check finally came, he had to wait again to ask for a pen because he wasn't given one. I, meanwhile, never even received the glass of water that I asked for, and the order of oyster shooters that I placed never came. This sort of oversight wouldn't have happened if they had an adequate amount of staff, I believe. The few cooks and servers working there are simply too busy to handle the volume of patrons that eat at their establishment! While I was happy to see that this Oyster Bar was larger than the one at Palace Station, I feel the staff they have working at the latter is much more attentive and on top of their game.  That being said, the location is much nearer to my home, so I'll definitely give this place another chance. Maybe I came on a bad night! I'd still recommend this place for the food--just don't expect to be quickly on your merry way after your meal."}
{"text":"So I came in with low expectation.  I sat and watched for a bit before ordering.     Oysters on half shell:  fresh! Super clean flavor but my only complaint is that they did not cut the foot and I had to do it myself. The horseradish was strong and the cocktail sauce was good.  And at least 6 choices for hot sauce on your table.   Clam chowder:   Very very tasty.  I actually just asked the cook how it is and he gave me a half ladle. I will be back to order this in a bread bowl later this week.    Salmon:  cooked perfectly!  Medium and flaky. I was a bit of a bother asking for a slightly different preparation than on the menu and the cook said \"easy no problem\". I asked for with pasta and they were quick and efficient.   Only ding was the pasta was slightly over cooked.   All in all I would return.  Ly and Dennis were great help at the counter   4 stars is due to ambiance and Chinaware. Not food or service."}
{"text":"Nom! The Oysters Royale and Bouillabaisse are delicious! The original Oyster Bar at Palace Station gets easily packed so this was a good location for a group of 6 to get their oysters on :0)"}
{"text":"We went back recently. The food was just as good as it was the last time we were there. My rating went down for the same reasons others have mentioned. It seems the service has gone down hill, not that it was bad but because they had one server working too many tables."}
{"text":"Food was decent, and reasonably priced given Vegas and the 4 star rating. Wait was only 20min for a group of 6 at dinner during CES.  Our table shared some oysters half raw half grilled to start. Tasty, but didn't seem quite good enough to be the namesake.  For entree, highly recommend the seafood risotto. I tried a bite of my friend's and it's delicious!  Our table also tried a few of the shooters. All agreed that the patron and Bloody Mary ones were probably the best. Be warned DO NOT order the Asian bomb. It is a global low. It's a mixture of soy sauce and sake and tastes like drinking down sushi in a very bad way.   Also, skip on the desserts!! The dessert menu had only 3 different pies. They are all tiny. I ordered the key lime pie and it is a slime green color, pretty disgusting. Why ruin a good thing? And almost no hint of lime at all!!!"}
{"text":"I got a hookup here from the casino and so eating it for 50% off tasted a lot better. My friend got the oyster dozen and I tried one, it was good (on ice), but tasted of nothing special. I couldn't necessarily discern the freshness or flavor from any other good oyster. I'm guessing it was average/good to everyone else, but not standout for an \"oyster bar.\" The New England clam chowder (the red version) was actually really good, had a ton of seafood and clams in it (though I tasted some small shell bits which wasn't nice), but it was really tasty, I recommend it. I got the fish of the day which was mahi-mahi, one of my top 4 fish behind sea bass, salmon, and swordfish, it was solid - grilled with lime and lemon pepper (nothing I couldn't have made on my own). I'd say as averagely tasty as it gets. I wouldn't really recommend this place for Vegas. It's not bad at all, also the service is very average to poor. For the price and location and ambiance you can go to a million better seafood spots."}
{"text":"Came here over the weekend after an event because all the other decent restaurants were closed. Was a little sceptic about it because of what hotel it was located in. This is probably one of the best restaurants you can find after 12am. Service was good. Not too busy. Loved the garlic oysters and scallops. Especially loved the crunchy texture of the corn that the scallops were served on. I ordered a side of white rice which was a mistake. It came out cold. But it was late so i didn't care. Will make sure to come back if i'm ever looking for a restaurant that late on the strip."}
{"text":"This place has really good seafood and the atmosphere is cool with the outdoor grotto. The linguini and clams are the best I ever had.  The service is friendly and I like how the kitchen is out in the open. The spicy shrimp is also really good."}
{"text":"$16 for Half a dozen Oysters and the meat was flimsy. Very overpriced and apparently this place has never had a taste of real Oysters before from California. $10 would have been a more appropriate price for the quality of Oysters they served. At least the Clam Chowder bowl was good. I would not recommend having Oysters here."}
{"text":"Finally tried the oyster shots my friend kept speaking of....yeah I've been missing out man. Who would think it was this good?! at a great price 3 for 10$ your choice vodka or tequila, yours truly got the tequila oyster shots. We added some more lime juices and Tabasco (we like things to be spicy) and freaking awesomeness in my mouth x3 and then ordered another set. definitely something to try here and i need to return to try other stuff. you will get a lil buzz especially if you order a beer. and the service was excellent!!"}
{"text":"Chef Bradley and staff are doing it right one again. FYI...park in the garage off harmon ...restaurant is on the right soon as you walk into the casino.  Even the \"typical\" crab cake has the Chef Bradley twist  with kale and Brussel sprout slaw."}
{"text":"Clams linguine and pan roast is so oo oo ooohhhhh tasty!!! Not to mention, oysters on the half shell are plump and hearty! Everything is so fresh and yummy!! Worth the wait!"}
{"text":"The Oyster Bar, located inside Sunset Station, is a fantastic spot for fresh seafood dishes of various kinds!  Having been visiting this spot for 10+ years I can attest to a cool homey vibe in a quaint setting.  Most people would figure anything inside of a casino wouldn't have a homey vibe, nor a quaint feel.  Oyster Bar has both with a cool facade, small interior, and located inside my favorite local casino!  The one \"must have\" here in my opinion is the NE Clam Chowder!  A bowl will run you $8 and when it's delivered to your table you'll think it's a bit overpriced.  It's deeper than you think, really thick and rich in flavor, and extremely filling!  The side Caesar salad is really large and the equivalent of a regular salad!  The two together is a full meal for a large eater!  Oyster Bar does it well, and they certainly feel like a small local hangout....inside a casino!"}
{"text":"They wouldn't let me order take out last night. Boo. I've done it last year and the year before."}
{"text":"We waited about 20 minutes on a Saturday night. Our waiter was nice and accommodating,  unlike the hostess. Hostess didn't care to move us to a bigger table where was open, so we would be more comfortable sitting for party of 4. As we sat at the table, hostess told us we would have move back because she was going seat another party there. Whatever, she had no hospitality, we're there first but she's so worry about the next party.   As for the food, I recommend getting Raw oysters and seafood pan roast..... pan roast is big enough to share with 2 people.   Clam chowder was also really good.  I give this place a 4 stars, even though i don't think this place live up to the hype.  However, it was good one time experience and I think everyone should try it at least once."}
{"text":"Good service; however, if you are looking for an amazing Pan Roast you need to go to the one in Palace Station. It's incomparable.  There is a reason why it's a one to two hour wait there and no wait at the Harrah location."}
{"text":"Rockefeller oysters were delicious.. we also had calamari and the portion was pretty big. Service was great and prompt.  Enjoy"}
{"text":"Chad and the staff are super friendly and gave us amazing service! The food is incredible! some of the best shrimp and grits I've ever had! I've also had the lobster roll, crab cakes, crab/lobster pan roast, tuna tacos, and the shrimp scampi...all delicious!"}
{"text":"Ate here with my hubby and my brother on a Monday evening at about 9:30pm.  There wasn't any line, and no hostess either.  After asking the bartender, we seated ourselves in one of the vacant tables.  Waiter promptly asked for our drinks and orders without being called.  Our orders came less than 10mins after.  I'm impressed.  Clam chowder came first, then the calamari, then OB's pan roast and the Oyster Rockefeller as last.  Oh, they also have complimentary bread which I never tried.  Oyster Rockefeller  - Fresh oysters on the half shell with spinach, hollandaise sauce, parmesan, baked to order (apparently these oysters are flown in fresh daily).  This was a very, very good tasting dish.  The soup that came with tasted heavenly on my palate. Calamari  - lightly breaded, came with 2 sauces and sliced half lemon.  Tasted fresh New England Clam Chowder - tasted good OB's pan roast  - lobster, shrimp, crab claws, clams and mussels, with smoke tomato cream sauce and jasmine rice ( loved this, very fresh tasting seafood) Also ordered 1 cocktail drink which I don't remember the name.  Price was reasonable considering Las Vegas' expensive bars and restaurants near the strip.  Paid total of $137 for all of these.  The only reason I'm not giving it a 5 star was the noise level.   Kinda noisy (especially because of the noisy group right beside our table). I have to raise my voice (almost yelling) to be heard everytime I talk."}
{"text":"Tip: This is NOT the same as the Oyster Bar at the Palace Station.  After going to to the Oyster Bar at the Palace Station and seeing that the wait was over 1 hour long, we Yelped and found this Oyster Bar. We originally thought it was the same thing, like it was another chain. I should've checked the photos before coming here. I thought that this place would have their Pan Roast like Ritters or The Boiler. I was wrong.  Ordered the Calamari and the Pan Roast. Calamari came out quickly but it wasn't hot. It was already cooling down. Calamari was just okay. Nothing special. Also got the Pan Roast, which had an assortment of seafood. Food wasn't hot as well, maybe that's why I didn't like it that much. Overall, food was just okay for me. I don't think I would return though."}
{"text":"Awesome! So simple, so ready, so quick, so delicious! No host to wait for. Start with sweet warm soft buns with whipped butter. Followed by $24/dozen oysters in a half shell. Watch the staff clean, ice the plate, add the horseradish, lemon half and cocktail sauce, shuck and place the oyster, then voila! They have an assortment of oysters and they probably give you mixture. Or if you prefer just one type, let them know. Had a couple sit by me and I guess they're regulars...with their order, it was a modified dish of oysters in a half shell and a oyster shot. Oysters were laid out as so perfectly prepared in a iced circular formation and the staff seasoned each half shell with a VERY GENEROUS amount of grey goose vodka! I can only imagine had good that was and how drunk I could have gotten.  Ordered the jambalaya with chicken and it was great! So filling. Chicken grilled and amazingly juicy and tender. The rice and sauce was just enough spice to tempt you for your next bite. Zesty without being overpowering. Loved the sausage...they were not overly salty or spicy, it was just right.  I almost wished I didn't have to go to the nightclub and just go home so I could have taken doggy bagged my jambalaya!"}
{"text":"Wow, where do I start....we actually have been eating here a while now- the mister thoroughly enjoys the red beans and rice and I do like their Manhattan clam chowder.  I will tell you now that what I am reviewing is going to be on their service.  Usually when we eat here, we sit at a table and there is normally no issues.  Well, yesterday we went to Sunset Station and it was Christmas Day.  As everyone in Vegas knows- the casinos are packed on Xmas day and the restaurants are usually packed.  Since this was the first Christmas that my daughter was spending with us, we thought we go out for a nice dinner.  We arrived at the Oyster Bar and there was a little line, no problem we think. So we wait in line, there is a party of 5 in front of us and they are waiting for a table since there is not enough room at the bar.  They tell us that there is room at the bar since there's only 3 of us.  We don't know if we should wait since there is a sign at the entrance that says \"seat yourself\"....well we walk around the bar and find 4 seats available, however, the bar area is not cleaned and there are leftover dishes from the last party...so we thought okay, we'll sit down and wait.  So we sat and waited- 10 minutes go by, no one comes to clean the bar area even though the entire staff is walking past us...another 10 mins go by- no acknowledgment from anyone behind the bar or waitstaff...the people sitting next to us tell us they are changing shifts...okay that's fine but why would another CUSTOMER have to tell us that??!??  I say it's okay, I know they are busy...so we wait another 10 mins...by now, the kid is really upset and the mister is FUMING...  It's not so much that they couldn't get to us, BUT at least ACKNOWLEDGE that we were there...all we needed was a \"we'll be right with you\"...my poor daughter was so upset she just wanted to leave...could it be that we were one of the few people in there with a kid? Maybe not...who knows but I have worked in a restaurant before and customers walking out is never a good thing BUT ultimately that's what happened...WE WALKED OUT...not because we didn't get served but we weren't even spoken to by ANYONE behind the bar...too bad cause we did like the food...OH WELL, looks like our money is not welcomed so we will NEVER be back..."}
{"text":"I used to go to the one in Palace Station, but this was closer to us. As my boyfriend and I stood at the host stand for 10 minutes, none of the staff seemed to care or acknowledge us. They weren't that busy either. There was even a lady who just cleaned a table and put the menus back on the host stand, which was directly in front of our faces. She just simply ignored us along with all the other staff. So we simply left. Horrible customer service."}
{"text":"This place is so Good ! I went laver day weekend & yes it was paved but they still had amazing service! The house favorite pan rost with all three (shrimp crab &nd lobster)is the best ! It is a house favorite!the clam chowder is all so Varry delightful!"}
{"text":"We had some extra time to kill before a movie so we thought, \"let's try this place\" and sat down for a big plate of fresh oysters. The oyster menu isn't extensive but hey, this is the desert! We ordered a sampler plate with a variety of oysters. They weren't expertly shucked (most of the juice had spilled out) but they weren't too pricey either so it wasn't too bad. The service is terribly SLOW so we had to flag somebody down to pay our check so we could make our movie.  I knew we were in trouble when I asked the guy behind the counter \"where are these oysters from?\" You know, New York, Seattle, Rhode Island...and he looked at us in all seriousness and replied \"the ocean.\" I kid you not. He was NOT joking! We started laughing and he didn't understand why. Then we asked to speak to a manager and asked him the same question. Folks, you'd think we had asked them what is the meaning of life!?! It started to get riotously funny but the more I think about it, the more it worries me that the staff doesn't know where they source their oysters.   We slurped them up and didn't get sick, so freshness wasn't an issue. If you are used to eating in some of the finest, fresh seafood oyster bars around the globe, you will be disappointed in this oyster bar. But if you just want a quick oyster snack, you could do much worse in this town."}
{"text":"We tried this newly opened (about 2 months) spot that had pan roast. We've tried several  pan roast spots in both Vegas and LA/OC. Can't help but compare them all to Oyster Bar in Palace Station. Here's the breakdown:  Pros:  No wait!!!! Big chunks of lobsters in pan roast Complimentary Fried Potato Chips Other main dishes like Lobster Roll  Cons (If I had to be picky):  Pan Roast base was good and hit the spot even though it wasn't the same. It tasted more like a tomato base.   The staff was awesome so check them out guys!!! They really seemed to care how we liked it so I feel like they would be good with you feedback, if ever negative. Check out my photos also!"}
{"text":"I wish I would have looked at the photos before I ordered! Ha!   Service was slow. The hostess made eye contact several times, cleared a couple tables, then came and asked us how many.   Why do they ask how many when clearly there are only 2 people standing in front of them? Lol ugh anyway...   We get seated. A few minutes later we get bread. A few minutes later our server Moon comes and gets our drink order. A few minutes later our drinks come and we order raw oysters as an appetizer. They come out a few minutes after that. We eat them. They're good. Then I ordered some potato wedges to hopefully help settle my stomach (helicopter ride right before this).   Basically everything had long delays in between. There was only one other server besides poor Moon. He's a great server though. You'll be lucky to have him.   My guy ordered the Cajun scallops and I ordered the new England steamer I think it was called. His pasta looked a little dry and stuck together. The scallops were a tad overcooked but had good flavor. My dish was very salty but had the best shrimp and mussels I've ever had! The sausage were really lame and the corn on the cob was kinda gross. :/  The best part of our meal was definitely the oysters. I was very hesitant about raw seafood in the desert, but they did not disappoint! The naked cowboy hot sauce was great!   But I'll stick to seafood in Seattle. :D"}
{"text":"This was my favorite food spot in the Hard Rock Hotel!!!  Small ... casual ...basically a kitchen with bar seats around it . Fits like 10 people .   Menu is small but damnit the food was excellent! Fresh and delicious!   Cajun Corn chowder soup was pretty good!   The shrimp cocktail was fresh and delicious   And the best thing EVER was the Calamari fries!!! YUM YUM YUM!!!   I definitely recommend this place"}
{"text":"If you've ever had a pan roast from Grand Central Station in NYC, you'll know this is a ketchup nightmare... it's so not right.  Horrible frozen ingredients mixed up with industrial grade HFC laden ketchup.  NO BUENO..."}
{"text":"AMAZING! If you love Oysters than this is the place to be.  Its not a easy place to find if you never been there but the staff in the casino makes it a bit easier. From a stand point outside looking in. It dosnt look like anything great. But once you meet the staff and try the food your whole aspect on it will change fast.    They have premium oysters for a bit more than the normal dozen. Normally they have 4 different kinds from around the world. If you want, you can make a dozen any combination you like. Staff is helpful to identify and describe the oysters to help you get a better understanding of what your eating or about to eat. If you love fish tacos I highly recommend them as well. They are grilled, so you dont feel as bad about eating them. Plus they have a Amazing sauce that they put on top. If you love Crab legs they are amazing as well. They cut them in half and it seems they grill them but I am still unsure. Having the crab legs cut in half makes it easy to eat and allows them to add a seasoning to them.    I hope everyone that loves seafood gets at least one chance to eat here. Ive ate at many seafood places in town and have still yet to find one that beats the Oyster Bar."}
{"text":"I failed at my first attempt to eat here, arriving at about 10:37pm after a gambling run.  On my second attempt, I was more successful.  I ponied up to this little bar and restaurant and got a jumbo shrimp cocktail.  My friends were about to take things to the next level and I had very little in my stomach, so this pit stop was very necessary.  The shrimp were big and flavorful as was the accompanying sauce.  The complimentary rolls and butter were taken advantage of given the fact that this is an in-casino restaurant which - much like everywhere else in Las Vegas - was kinda overpriced.  If you have a Total Rewards card from the Harrah's group, use it to get a slight discount here.  I did not experience much of the menu, but what I did experience I liked very much.  If you like oysters and other seafood, it appeared as if my co-patrons were very much enjoying what they were eating."}
{"text":"Really wanted to try the Oyster Bar at Palace Station, but couldn't since it was 21 and over and I had my kids.  Searching around Yelp, I found this other Oyster Bar and found out they are \"related\".  Whether or not the recipes and quality are the same, I cannot confirm.  I tried to figure that out thru the reviews, even asked the chef here, but couldn't really get a clear answer, other than they are very similar.  Anyway, I can at least report the food was great here and portions pretty big.  We got oysters on the half shell, pan roast and seafood pasta.  Everything was very good, just wish the pasta sauce was hotter, was mostly warm.  Anyway, it was a bit of a drive, but the food was enjoyable.  I was really impressed with this hotel, much more relaxed than typical Vegas hotels, pretty spacious too.  Nice change of pace and scenery from Vegas.  Recommended."}
{"text":"I've been to many Oyster bar before, and this place is a bit different from others. Food Wise.  Their Pan Roast it's so different from other places, not saying it taste bad or anything, but it's just different. and It's a bit over price.  There is no wait every time we passed by, so there must be a reason for that. And  it's definitely a bit over price. but acceptable though.  PS, their complementary bread is pretty good!!!"}
{"text":"I'm not really a seafood kinda girl but the bf loves oysters so it was decided.  We trekked what seemed like miles to Harrah's and hunted down this oyster bar.  It is in the most awkward area for a restaurant.  Ordered the lobster bisque - yummy and creamy! And I also had the salmon which was DELICIOUS! The portion was surprisingly generous. The salmon was nicely seasoned and the glaze was really tasty. It's served with white rice which was kind of awkward.  The bf ordered jumbo shrimp cocktail and half dozen half shells.  I assume he enjoyed it because he didn't leave any crumbs behind.  I wasn't that impressed with the service or the place.  \"meh\""}
{"text":"Grabbing a quick snack! The grilled oysters were amazing. Fast and friendly service! Most impressive is when we asked what brand was the house whiskey the bartender explained it came from their tap gun, but took the time to find a bottle in back to show the us the label so we could find back home. Above and beyond!"}
{"text":"When I went to Vegas this summer, I was off whack. I was craving seafood in the middle of the desert... A land full of sand and no water ports. I was in the mood for fresh seafood... Why? But, we found this oyster bar in Harrahs. They had fresh oysters!  If your craving seafood in the middle of desert land, Vegas, I would recommend this place.  Only fall back, they serve dry very dry bread. And I'm a gal who loves her carbohydrates (and butter) so I was disappointed."}
{"text":"Went there last night with wifey because we were wanting some seafood. We first tried the oyster bar at Palace Station but they had way too long of a line. We ended up coming here in hopes that it wouldn't be as busy. We are so glad we did because the service and food were better. We got crab cakes that were super good came with some sort of salad and tartar sauce. Then I got the combo pan roast( Sea bass,Lobster,shrimp and chicken) and my wife got the shrimp scampi. Both dishes were damn delicious. The sea bass was probably some of the best fish I've had ever.The lobster and crab were really tender and had a very good texture to them. The home made linguini was fantastic . The shrimp was super good too. The staff there is very friendly and the dude cooking ( Mike ) was super on point. Everything was superb!! Can't wait to come back and try the fish and chips!"}
{"text":"Arrived after walking around on a Sunday afternoon - people watching and shopping. We ended up here watching the women's world cup soccer finals. The seafood bar was wide open and had perfect seating   in front of a flat screen.   The male waiter who was taking care of some tables also gave me a menu. Don't expect any happy hour or drink specials here and expect to pay $7.00 for a bottle of beer since you're on the strip. I ordered the cold seafood platter which had half a lobster tail, 4 mussels, 4 oysters and four prawns. As for the taste and quality I'll just say I've experienced better especially for what they charge. Most of the seafood with the exception of the prawns were bland, dry amd juiceless.  The service by the waiter was non existent and getting bread,  water and the bill was like pulling teeth. I'm not sure if because it was July 5th and the guy was burnt out or what but next  time do the customers a favor and call in sick. I must give credit to the waiter behind the seafood bar- he was spot on and on his game, unfortunately we got stuck with bozzo the clown. I tipped accordingly!  I can say that based on this experience I wouldn't give this place another opportunity, especially since there are so many legitimate establishments in Las Vegas that appreciate and want to earn your business."}
{"text":"The Good: knowledge staff; good service.  The Bad: Oyster selection (not how you make them buy the variety of oysters) is very small for an \"oyster\" bar.  The Rest: Ask the server for oysters not on the menu. I asked and they had some wonderful Kumamotos!"}
{"text":"Great service. Fresh Shrimp cocktail, dozen oysters without the liquor, fried oysters pretty bland, nice rum and coke."}
{"text":"OMG...my boyfriend and I were like two little piggies at this place!  We sat at the bar and ordered hella food!!!  There was barely any room for all of our dishes..the chef/waiter had to wait until we were done with some dishes, take them away, then give us our remaining dishes!  We had half a dozen raw oysters, oysters rockefeller, oysters shooters, the jambalaya with chicken, and the seafood risotto.  Oh man were we stuffed.  Believe it or not, we finished it all!  We couldn't let it go to waste!  Such a cute little place with funny chefs and servers!  I will definitely come back here and grub some more!!"}
{"text":"We usual stay at Bally's when we stay on the strip. It is a short walk to so many places. Harrah's is a few casinos down the strip. Inside the casino a ways is the Oyster Bar. It is more or less in the middle of the casino. They have a big circular bar and a few tables on one end and maybe some more tables inside the restaurant. We just ambled up to the bar and sat down. The bartender was really friendly and quick to get us situated with beers and oysters. We got a dozen on the half shell and a half dozen Rockefeller. The raw ones were being shucked right there by a equally friendly gal.  The bartender said the oysters were from New York. No choice of bivalves, but I really don't need choices if the ones they have are good and fresh, which these were. They were also not expensive, especially for the Las Vegas strip. The Rockefeller was really good. Very rich and saucy with the juicy oyster underneath the spinach and what not. Quite different from the ones I had at Binion's the night before. Overall a very good place to camp out with beer and oysters."}
{"text":"Bad! None of the shrimp were deveined and the clams had sand in them, rookie mistakes for a seafood place"}
{"text":"Great oysters with fresh horseradish. The chefs at the bar are great. Very cool to sit at the bar and watch chefs at work."}
{"text":"Fellow Yelpers, you have hit the nail on the head with this one.   I'm originally from the East Coast and I do have opinions about seafood. Stuck-up, know-it-all opinions... and I was blown away by this restaurant.   I went to this restaurant strictly based on the reviews I read here and I had an incredible experience! We ordered a garden salad, half-dozen oysters on the half-shell, crab cakes, and the bouillabaisse.   The salad was your standard restaurant starter. Fresh vegetables and nothing fancy. But that's not what I came for. The oysters - the OYSTERS!! YES!! - were so, so good. I was sorry we had only ordered a half dozen! They were cold, fresh, shucked in front of us, and eaten in about two minutes. The \"Maryland-Style\" crab cakes were very meaty, with very little, if no bread at all. The seasoning was very light and I was impressed, and I am very, VERY opinionated when anyone claims \"Maryland\" when describing their crab dishes. The bouillabaisse had LARGE shrimp and HUGE scallops as well as mussels, clams, lobster and fish. The broth was a little too rich for my taste but I can appreciate how enjoyable the dish is. I noticed that the people seated next to us had ordered the jambalaya and a fried shrimp appetizer. Both of those dishes had the very large shrimp. On the other side of us, I overheard a man telling his server that he comes to this restaurant every time he visits Las Vegas, and was bringing his companion for the first time, who remarked about how much they enjoyed the food.   Our server was excellent. He was very friendly, offered helpful suggestions and even hinted to us that while there was a charge for an official split-plate request, there was no charge for him to bring me an extra plate... (if I wanted to split the food myself).   A great meal and I will definetly be back!"}
{"text":"I ate here tonight hoping it was similar to the oyster bar in Palace Station.  A stranger my boyfriend and I spoke to at the Palace Station oyster bar insisted to us it was the same but without the line.  Wow he was so wrong.  Who listens to strangers anyways?  That's what I get!  The cool thing is though that they have a sushi bar and some other seafood items like calamari and crabcakes.  I had the shrimp tempura special which was pretty good.  I also tried a shrimp appetizer that was wrapped in won ton and fried.  My boyfriend ordered the pan roast special.  It was okay but I was so disappointed after having tried the pan roast at Palace Station.  Now I know better and hopefully you do too!  Shout out to the awesome staff though- everyone was super friendly- especially Ana!!!  We all loved Ana!"}
{"text":"Wonderful restaurant inside Harrah's hotel casino. Came here to have diner and service was outstanding. Oysters, and the rest of the meal was delicious, tasty, and doen right.  The waitress Angie was very attentive, and made our evening pleasant. Definitively recommended.  Will go back."}
{"text":"We came in a Sunday afternoon for lunch and it surprisingly wasn't busy compared to the Oyster Bar at the Palace Station. We walked up to an empty kiosk and a sign that said to wait to be seated. We waited a good 10 minutes before a guest behind us told us that maybe we should just seat ourselves. As we were about to sit down, the hostess comes up with this really annoying tone telling us, \"my sign says to wait to be seated.\"  We informed her that we were waiting for a good while and her excuse was that she was in the back and didn't see us.   Anyway, we requested a table for 3 and we immediately seated. This ends up being our biggest mistake. We waited another 10 minutes for our waiter to run by and tell is that he'll be right with us. We waited another 5 minutes before he finally tends to us. He ended up being very friendly, but he was just too slow. We ordered a bowl of clam chowder, a dozen oysters, seafood risotto, and Cajun scallops along with a couple of drinks. The drinks and soup came out pretty quick, but after that it was another 15-20 minute wait for the rest of our entrees and oysters. I got annoyed watching diners sitting at the bar, who arrived way after us, receive their plates of oysters and entrees.   The food was actually very good so no complaints there. The food is actually earning my two stars. After eating we end up waiting another 15 minutes for the waiter to pass by our table again to ask for our check. Surprisingly, he was very quick with swiping my card. However, not once were we checked up on. I'm not the type that needs to be treated like a king , but I do believe that waiters should work for their tip. Sadly, we would not return."}
{"text":"I've been to vegas so many times, yet I barely discovered this restaurant last year.   I absolutely adore this place.   My boyfriend and I normally just order oysters.   But when we were there last night, we ordered the Pico del oysters with the Catch of the Day: Chilean Sea Bass.    There is complimentary crunchy flat bread. Be careful don't get full off that though.   Servers are extremely nice and so are the cooks.   We had chatted with one of the cooks our first time there and asked when they receive their shipment of oysters and other seafood. He said they come in fresh every morning.  No wonder it tastes so fresh ! A+ !"}
{"text":"I have nothing to say about the food however I was served a mule w o a copper mug. Waitress was stuck up and bitchy"}
{"text":"This place is off the hook (no pun intended)!!! Get it?  Seafood / hooks??? Ok nevermind but this place is seriously delicious! My husband and I enjoyed eating here the last time we were in Vegas.  I could go on for days about the jambalaya and fresh oysters!  I am looking forward to our next visit in two weeks.  If anything has changed I will be sure to update my review.  I sure hope not though because I am looking forward to eating here again!  Yummers in my tummers!"}
{"text":"Food was just ok. Nothing special about it. Service was ok. Server forgot to bring my water out for almost ten minutes, until I reminded him. Also waited a while for the check. Would have been 2 stars, but he made up for it at the end by trying to hold a conversation with us."}
{"text":"I absolutely loved the linguini and clams. It is so amazing. I came back a second time to get it! The broth is so tasty. The seafood all tastes super fresh.  I did try the fish & chips but wasn't as impressed at the linguini.  The mixed drinks are also super delicious! I think I ordered the Bonita.  Our server was super nice.  I liked being able to watch them prepare the food in front of us. It's a cute little place inside the Hard Rock. Other than the smoke, not much you can do being in the casino, it was a great experience!"}
{"text":"Our waiter completely ignored us the first 4 times he walked by us after seeing the adjacent table. No \" I will be right with you\" or anything of that sort. After finally getting a hold of him and preventing him from running away he was nicer the rest of the meal.  The oysters were puny! But at least they were fairly fresh. For two people we ordered  half dozen oyster rocker feller ( good and rich) half dozen oyster royale ( this was gross, i had to force myself to finish it) dozen raw oysters crab louie salad ( generous crab portions, avocado was black however) parmesan crusted halibut ( i think was decent)  The lady shucking the oyster was moving at a snail's pace. We waited forever while we watched her shuck them in slow motion. It was similar to waiting for water to boil. She really should stop talking to the cook and needs to concentrate on working more.  We didn't complain but our server actually came over several times to point out he knew it was taking a while. He even looked over at her and said \"she is very slow\". The table to the right of us complained about how long their order was taking, as did the table to our left; both tables arrived way after we did.  Bill was about 115."}
{"text":"Chef Chad and Liz are amazing. The menu items were so delicious. We had crab cakes, shrimp and grits, oysters, PEI mussels, omg. All 5 stars and you can't go wrong. Super fun environment, eating while being entertained. Come here and you will see.   This place is Amazing!!"}
{"text":"Raymundo was awesome! Took great care of us and was very interactive with us and the rest of guest. The oysters on the half shell are awesome and oyster shooters arw to die for!! But definitely 5 for Raymundo!"}
{"text":"OMG!!!! The Seafood Risotto was out of this world - but I have to be truthful, I cheated.  I saw 3 customer eating the same dish, needless to say, I had approach one of the customer and had ask his opinioun.  So you can imagine what his response was.. The best!!  Fried Calamaries was perfect breaded and fried.  Service is wonderful.  Will go back!!"}
{"text":"Yes sir this is the real deal and a bit more.  I had the House Etouffee and was blown away on how good it was.  The portion was a great size, the seasoning (spicy) was oh so hot (just the way I like it :-) and the service extraordinary.  By the way I would have gladly paid ten more dollars and still have been happy.  I'm a Cajun food junkie and this was truly a fix.  My only disclaimer is in order to have this same tasteful experience, Vanessa has to be the cook."}
{"text":"the oysters here are bomb diggity!! I dont even usually like oysters because i think it has that ocean taste but these oysters were delish!!! and the prices are very reasonable!  I also ordered the shrimp scampi and that was good as well. The shrimps were a good size and the sauce was very tasty. I am excited to pay this place another visit when i come back to vegas"}
{"text":"Had a rough experience here.  My wife felt ill afterwards and our server was very inattentive.  It was very hard even to get his attention to pay our bill.  I called the facility to try and recieve some resolution to this but after several failed attempts and no calls back, we gave up."}
{"text":"Hey this place rocks! Richard took care of us. The raw bar was fantasti please give it a try.you will not be disappointe"}
{"text":"I love the one in the Palace Station casino (been a fan for years!) but they don't make Jambalaya anymore, so this one has a slight edge (although farther to make the trip for us) to the one int the PS casino. This one also has better ambiance- can be romantic, since there is additonal seating (private, tables and booths as well) in addition to the seating (stools) around the chefs, where they prepare and make your food, right in front of you. There is also a waterfall, which adds to the ambiance. I always order the House Gumbo (Sausage, Chicken & Seafood)- love love love love it. I always eat half , and take home the other half. All Gumbo and Pan Roast dishes come with crackle bread (generous- might just come with everything, actually), a hard roll, and a scoop of rice. We used the restaurant.com certificates but sadly, no longer participating in the restaurant.com promotion. The service is really good and the chefs here are more similar than the PS location (they vary in terms of performance-at the PS location). It's not as busy as the one at Palace Station, but then again, it does have more seating other than stools."}
{"text":"The oysters are like pearls of goodness....rich, fresh and succulent.  There are plenty of restaurants to choose in Vegas, and since it was my last night at Harrahs with the hubby, I really just wanted to stay in the hotel, find a good place to eat without compromising flavor.  Voila ... Oyster Bar!   We sat at the bar and Trent our server, who's been working there for 19 years was super fabulous.  His service was impeccable and really showed that he loves his job.   So I ordered the Grilled Oysters with Garlic-Parmesan Butter and Alaskan King Crab Cocktails....both hit the spot!  I came here for Oysters and even the crab legs did not disappoint.  Overall, we had a great experience and walked away with a happy tummy.  So will I come back here again ...Absolutely!"}
{"text":"Fresh oysters and blackened scallops pasta! So yummy at reasonable prices too. I have to come here every time I go to vegas!"}
{"text":"I love their linguini and white clam sauce and New England Clam Chowder...very good food and reasonably priced"}
{"text":"My kids and i went there for lunch.  And after waiting about 15 mins to be helped I was really looking foward to the charbroiled oysters but the cook said i couldn't have any until 2pm because they were short staffed. :( it was just about 1pm at this point. I figured since i couldn't have my oysters then ill order the pan roast and shrimp scampi. The food was good. But it wasnt something I'll come back for. Overall it was ok except i had to literally flag down someone to get me water and i never got my bread which was the second reason i was looking foward to lunch. If you want good Oyster bar food just stick to Palace Station."}
{"text":"Loved this lil walk up spot inside the hard rock hotel. I stay here abt twice a month and sadly never are here. Oh boy how that has changed I ate there 3 days in a row. Loved everything! Shrimp and Grits were my fave! This is not a traditional sit down restaurant, you just walk up and grab a sit at the bar. It's alil pricy average 20+ but it's worth it."}
{"text":"Ok, here's the deal.  I feel like an ass because I haven't written a review since my last trip anywhere (which was SF).  I realized, quite sadly, that I haven't visited anywhere new in a while that made me think of reviewing.  It seems to be a trip thing now--which clearly blows, since I live to review!!  Anywho, I went on another family escapade to Sin City during Spring Break.  We stayed at Harrah's again cause it was free.  Last time we ate there, I was somewhat disappointed.  This time, the experience was notably better.  We had dinner at their Italian restaurant that I didn't know existed until my mom suggested we have dinner there.   Here's the thing: we had arrived earlier that day, and my sister and I spent some time walking around the Strip until dinnertime.  We get to the restaurant and all I can say is that I was underdressed from here to yesteryear.  Woops!!!  Someone say something man!!  A change of clothes was only an elevator ride away.  But, as my cousin was quick to point out, not too big a deal--it's Vegas; you get brides and bums dining in the same restaurant at the same time.  (I was the bum!!)  I had a great Caesar salad to start.  Yes I sample Caesar salads a lot, cause it's one of those things--like the onion soup, or the fish tacos.  The bread basket was damn good, too.  A nice olive oil/vinegar brought to the table; shaken, not stirred.  The Pinot Grigio was darn good--really bold and flavorful.  I had scallops for dinner.  Oh were they good?!!!?!!  Umm, yes.  The potatoes were tasty, too.   I sampled my sister's pasta with vodka sauce and prosciutto and shrimp.  I really liked it.  You're supposed to taste the pasta in these dished people.  The pasta isn't supposed to be drowning in some thick sauce.  Dessert was ridiculous!!  We were stuffed full, but decided to order the dessert on the menu meant for two people.  So here comes this GIANT mound of cream.  (Apparently the dessert's name was \"white mountain\" in Italian---I have no cultural tact, clearly.)  Then, the waiter brings up this cart with a grill, lights the sucker and pours some lovely Amaretto into a pan.  Next thing you know, that liquid's on fire and is being poured (still with flames about) onto the white mound.  AHHHHH, white mountain on freakin' liquor fire!!!!  Yes, we attracted attention with our choice of dessert.  The bachelorette party at the next table took pictures...He cut into it, and it was dark chocolate and white chocolate gelato inside.  It was REALLY good!!!  BTW, it said for two...two what?  Hippos?!!?  The thing was HYUGE!!  No really, I'm a fatass, but really...  A final note on the ambience---a tad cheese, but who cares!?  It's Vegas.  Open kitchen with lots of flames and sounds and smells.  A traveling guitarist playing all the kitschy Italian hits---sing it if you know it!!!  (And my dad did know quite a few of them.  My lushed-up mother kept telling him that he sings much better than the guitarist and that he should take over...'nuff about that.)  The owner travelled from table to table chatting up the clientele.  All around a darn good time."}
{"text":"One of my favorite restaurants in Henderson.   The gumbo is just like I'd get back home in Louisiana.   Menu is virtually the same as the better known Oyster Bar at Palace Station but this restaurant is not open 24/7,  but it's larger and there is almost never a line.   I can't eat there much anymore because I'm on a low sodium diet and their various soups, stews, and gumbos have quite of bit of it,  but they will replace 50% of the stock with water in their gumbos which cuts the sodium significantly so be sure to tell the Chef what you want and they'll take care of you."}
{"text":"Ordered the shrimp cocktail which costs $20. It came on a huge dish with only 4 medium sized shrimp on it. Crab cakes were ok, salty. I would not recommend this place."}
{"text":"This is the best place to eat in Harrah's. The Fat Basterd Oysters were fresh and tasty.  The guys working there are experience and it shows in their expert suggestions in food choices, professionalism and friendliness. Say hi when you visit!"}
{"text":"Awesome service, incredible fish tacos. Such a hidden gem of Vegas! Will be back. Joel is the best & Ly is such a friendly & attentive waiter. Love this place. Missing out if you don't try!"}
{"text":"Came here for a late night snack.  Ordered the mixed plate and they gave us a variety.  For condiments it was lemon, tabasco, pico de gallo, red wine vinegar with scallion.  Ordered some Corona's to wash it down.  When we were eating we witnessed some being smoked up on the grill N'awlins style.  Asked the people next to us and they said they had a nice smoked flavour but were not true New Orleans style!  Dang good man!"}
{"text":"The staff Lupita, Chef Dennis, Gary, Felix, and Dexter the bartender , and everyone here is Awesome!! The parmesan crusted Halibut was so delicious and fresh, oysters were firm and briny! Love the people and this restaurant!"}
{"text":"Excellent place to grab a bite. My husband and I decided to wait around until this place opens instead of of grabbing breakfast.  This place does not disappoint and it was worth waiting around.  I ordered the Gumbo and my husband ordered the Shrimp and Grits. The 2 dishes are being cooked right in front of you so you can see the meal coming together.  Both meals are served piping hot.   The Gumbo had giant chunks of chicken, andouille and freshly fried okra. The taste is so complex and good with a slight kick to it. It matched perfectly with the big scoop of rice that came with it.   The Shrimp in the Shrimp and Grits were sweet and huge. They were barbecued to perfection. The Grits had the perfect texture and the cheese was placed under the the Grits melted perfectly.   Definitely visit here again the next time I'm in Vegas."}
{"text":"Best shrimp and grits and raw oysters.....prob in the strip even though it's just off the strip in Hard Rock hotel. Great service. Cooks cook to your taste if you want to bump up the spice level. Large portions, they will even heat up your leftovers the next day for you so cool. Show the love check them out, hopefully they stay when Virgin hotel takes over Hard Rock"}
{"text":"We originally wanted the to go to the Mexican restaurant costa, but they were closed, so we decided to go to the Oyster Bar. My girlfriend was nervous about eating seafood and the chef Rocky, made sure to find out what we liked. He then brought me the steamed clams and muscles. Rocky hooked it up, the clams and muscles were very good had an excellent broth and the sushi he brought for my girlfriend was good and she enjoyed. Thanks again chef Rocky."}
{"text":"Ly was great will definitely come here again. Grilled oysters and patron oyster shooter"}
{"text":"I went here for a light dinner. One word that sums this place up is \"delish!\"  I loved it. The crab cakes were on point, the bread basket was nice and warm, the dozen oysters were so fresh. I asked for pico de gallo for the oysters and our waitress brought it right out.  She was really pleasant and checked on us regularly. She suggested the oyster shooters in the glass, and omg!!  Yummy Buzz!! We got 2 plain with just tequila and the other one with the pineapple juice and jalapeño mixture.  I would go back here for the crab cakes any day.  I forgot our servers name, but she was a really cool hispanic girl, with a memorable laugh. :D in a good way. This is my new \"we HAVE to go there\" place when I'm in Las Vegas."}
{"text":"Horrible service. Waited 90 minutes for my pan roast, and he told me they ran out of rice while I was waiting"}
{"text":"This is the best place ever!!!! I was never up to trying Oysters, and still to this day I only eat them from here. They are delicious!!!!! Clean place, great chef's!! Affordable prices! I crave this place all the time, I want to drive there just to eat there!!! I had a dozen oysters, Cesar salad, and the chef gave me and my girlfriends this bomb plate, I believe it was Tiger Shrimp Brushetta. OMG This was the greatest part!!!! I still can't get over how FANTASTIC this tasted!! I give this place 5 stars, and recommend it to anyone who is iffy about trying oysters!!!!! We were all in heaven, this wasn't my first time there, however it was for my girlfriends, and they want to go back. They did not want to eat or drink anything after to savor the taste!!!"}
{"text":"five stars for the oysters! this is as delicious and fresh as it gets! especially in the summer when vegas is at its hottest. i cant get enough of their cocktail sauce either.  ladies beware though, theres a waiter that stares at boobies.. and he does not do it discretely.   but other than that, everything was just fab. ive had a pasta dish there before and it was really good.. the bread and butter is yummy.. and the waiters (minus the boob-staring pervert) are funny and likeable  oh yeah this place is in Harrah's"}
{"text":"Located in Harrah's, it's literally an oyster bar in the casino. Not gonna lie, I was a bit skeptical but the meal did not disappoint!  I got a dozen oysters for $30. Less than $3 a piece so it's not priced too badly. I wish the oysters were more plump though. I felt like the oysters I was given were the runts of the bunch. They were delicious but I do wish they were bigger.  My boyfriend got the seared scallop pasta. SO GOOD. The scallops were cooked to perfection and the pasta was in a really delicious sauce as well. The sauce itself also had little bay scallops in it. If you love scallops, this one is a must try!"}
{"text":"I was out in Vegas last week for work. And since I was looking to try to eat healthier and had a hankering for oysters, the Oyster Bar at Harrah's was calling my name. And I was happy it did.   My waiter was awesome. He walked me through all of the oysters available.   What I especially liked about him was I asked which was better: the fried calimari or the Manhattan Clam Chowder, which was about 7 bucks cheaper. He said \"get the chowder. You'll love it.\"  I did...and he was correct. It was amazing. Spicy, full of clam meat and veggies and over the top in flavor.   Then I went with the Crab Louis salad and that - as my picture states - is a work of art. An amazing amalgam of flavors and textures loaded with crab meat and avocado and greens.   Great service and outstanding food."}
{"text":"Loved this place. Moon was our server and he provided excellent service and recommendation. He recommend we order the Chilean sea bass and we did. We started with a dozen blue point oysters. They were delicious and fresh. We also ordered the Pan Roast as well. The broth was heaven. Everything was great here. I loved it!"}
{"text":"I'm going to give the oyster bar 3 stars due to the following...  Every time I go there, i have to ask to be waited on. Once I finally get the attention and I get my order taken, They never ask if I need anything else. I had to ask for some more tea. With that being said, I wanted to order an oyster shooter when I initially sat down, but nobody ever acknowledged me. Don't get me wrong, I love the food, and that's why I keep coming back, but the guys need to be a lot more attentive and not look so grouchy as they walk back and forth not acknowledging you. I think the manager needs to have a little training session on greeting and customer service. They're very much lacking in that department."}
{"text":"My family and I came to Sunset Station for a movie, and dinner. It has been a while since we've been to the Oyster Bar. I looked foward all night to starting with  their amazing warm sourdough rolls, and they don't have them anymore. They now serve stale, dry, rolls that were absolutely awful. I ordered the gumbo... with chicken, sausage, and shrimp. The chicken was huge chopped pieces of previously grilled fillets that are probably pre-frozen, and didn't taste fresh... like the kind you buy at Sams Club in bulk. It used to have fresh shredded chicken that seemed like it was cooked, in house....shrimps were small, and I didn't taste the sausage. The sauce was so salty that I had to send it back, and the next one was just as salty, but I was so hungry I poured the rest of my wine into the gumbo to cut it.. and it actually wasnt bad lol...However I am still chugging down water from the saltiness of the dish, and it's been hours.  My brother enjoyed his pan roast, but they ran out of crab lol. So none of us could have crab in any appetizers, crab cocktail, or main courses which was disappointing. Some of us ordered oyster shooters, with tequila.. but I think they forgot the tequila? lol Very sad, and disappointing to see what it has become. It's a local establishment, and it used to be good. It was definitely our last time to the Oyster Bar at Sunset. I would suggest going to the Palace Station, or even Southpoint. I will finish on a positive note... The \"Wonder Woman\" movie was really good.. and I hadn't been in the theater since they changed the seats. Very comfortable."}
{"text":"Located in Texas Station Hotel Casino, this place beats the oyster bar in the Palace Station by a mile (actually it's 4 miles away, but who's counting). They make everything right in front of you, and you can get it custom made to your level of spice! They have crazy specials like $6.99 for jambalaya! If you are in the area check it out. Live it up you are in Las Vegas for cryin' out loud!"}
{"text":"This place truly is awesome.. You wouldn't think so but we came here because reviews were so good and we weren't disappointed!  The staff clearly loves what they do - they have a thousand recommendations. Seafood is very fresh - excellent mussels, fantastic ahi tuna salad and cioppino. Also crabby Mary - very good Bloody Mary!! Highly advised sit at bar - the only thing that's not great about the place is the ambience / but the staff totally makes up for it."}
{"text":"My friend took me here for lunch on a weekday. Apparently they have a jambalaya special EVERYDAY! Needless to say, I'm addicted. One of their cooks (a woman) makes it just perfect. Today, I treated a couple of Co-workers due to a birthday. The food was good but unfortunately, they only have one waitress going around so it takes a while to get our food. Still, great jambalaya for a great price! $6.99!!! Oh yes, let's not forget their FREE, awesome warm rolls with butter. YUM!"}
{"text":"You'll have to take this review with a grain of ocean salt since I've never eaten at the famed Oyster Bar at Palace Station. But having been thwarted by the long lines on the smoky casino floor several times and not wanting to lose any more vacation time to this, we gave up on trying the famous one and went to one of its lesser-known cousins. Based on reviews we decided to try the Oyster Bar at Texas Station. Though it closes earlier (or rather, at all) than the PS OB, they still seated us a half hour before closing on or near Christmas with a gracious (but weary) smile.  This location had a whole restaurant area with tables, as opposed to the single bar at PS. Also, the C-shaped bar here was at least twice the size of the PS bar. I don't know if it was because Texas Station is a lot less crowded than Palace Station, but it was a lot less smoky overall, and the restaurant itself was not smoky at all. (Also parking was much easier.)  We ordered the lobster pan roast (5 spiciness) with rice and pasta. At first they gave us just rice because the cook had pony trailed it but it was easy to get our pasta. The bread for dipping was meh, and the linguine was on the soft side, but the pan roast itself was delicious. It tasted exactly how I imagined. The spiciness level was not so hot I couldn't taste the other flavors, and the lobster was slightly underdone to keep it from overcooking in the boiling-hot bowl. There were at least 7 large chunks of tail and claw meat and lots of smaller pieces. One order was enough to be a full for both of us, with leftovers. (At home we added chicken, sausage, and our own pasta to the sauce to get a whole second meal out of it.)  Both the cook and the waitress were friendly and chatted with us through the meal, but weren't overbearing. Though they started cleaning, putting up chairs and doing side work while we ate, they still made sure our waters were filled and even told us not to hurry when we apologized for still being there after closing time. We weren't even the last ones to leave.  Because it was their error they didn't even charge us for the side of pasta. Between that and the cheaper prices compared to PS, we calculated that it would cost the same to eat at PS and leave a 20% tip as it would to leave a 100% tip here, so we did. Merry Christmas, y'all."}
{"text":"Pros food was great. Cons horrible service add more people tables are dirty and sit with dirty dishes almost the whole meal we sat at the bar because all the tables were dirty!"}
{"text":"We used to come here about 8 years ago... I know things change.  However, things shouldn't change for the worse.  The clam chowder is disgusting now- tastes like a giant green pepper. :(.  Service was mediocre at best.  Sad we won't be back but now we won't dream of the goodness it used to be anymore...."}
{"text":"OYSTERS OYSTERS OYSTERS.  I don't think I'd get anything else here...the Penazzi features oysters for a great price. You can get 'em raw, baked, or deep fried. The Rockerfellers are too rich for my taste (as oysters pack enough cholesterol for me) so getting a few dozen raw oysters to share with friends is what I normally do.  The ambiance here isn't great and yeah, it's Harrah's, but damn those oysters are good!"}
{"text":"I didn't want to write this but I reached out to the hotel and got no response.  This use to be great but they switched chef's.   I spent $70 there this weekend and got food poisoning.  Legit 100% violent food poisoning.  The lobster roll they served me had undercooked basically raw lobster. There's no excuse for this you can tell when lobster is raw when prepping it.  Lobster and shellfish that is served cooked can make people really sick. I called the hotel 3 times just to let them know they should watch this and they never returned my call.  If you can't tell or don't care that the lobster is raw you shouldn't be serving it."}
{"text":"Worst Vegas experience ever because of the server. Server from hell. I thought I was being Punk'd he was so awful and mean. I'm annoyed that I even have to give this place 1 star. There should be a negative stars option. I love oysters so my husband decided to take me to this establishment. We sat down and after 10 minutes I had to bug the lady lady who was shucking oysters and doing other busywork and asked her if we could order. She seemed surprised that no one had come by and she said \"I can grab bread, water and get your server\". Five minutes later he comes by and takes our order. We got our GRAINY  oysters pretty fast but my husbands beer took 15 minutes. The guys who sat down after us got their beers faster and they took notice and chimed in on how bad the service was and how it wasn't even busy. So my husband and I were done with our meal and still no beer. So I asked the lady to cancel the beer ( because of course we couldn't find our server). 5 minutes later the server comes with a beer. I told him we canceled it so he looked at the guys next to us and said \" Want a free beer, here you go\". Unbelievable!! The guys felt bad and gave us the beer. This guy turned me off from the oyster bar, and from Harrahs. I'll never go to either one again. I cant believe they would employ someone that seems like he hates his job. It could be worse, he could be a stripper. How he still has a job when there are better and more capable people blows my mind. Maybe he should look into doing magic shows since he's a server who likes to perform disappearing acts when he should be serving food."}
{"text":"This is one of the best Oyster bars in town. Have tried some of the others OB in town but we keep coming back to Harrahs Oyter Bar. Food is always consistent and taste amazing. Service is always great."}
{"text":"Awesome place! We were looking for a nice oyster bar that had a good selection of wine and fresh oysters and we found it! Service was quick and knowledgeable and the atmosphere made an immediate impression. Located at the back of the casino close to the parking garage, so it was easy to get to!"}
{"text":"I've lived in town 22 years and this was the first time I actually went there for dinner. maybe being from the east coast were seafood is fresh and prepared properly jaded me but I was so disappointed. I ordered a seafood stew that was okay but not nearly worth the $21 I paid. There was only a few tiny clams a couple of muscles to shrimp and some reminisce of the ends of crab legs that were not worth even trying to harvest the meat. My friend ordered the crab legs, her all time favorite, and it too disappointed her. The meat was stringy and the crabs legs were tiny. on top of that they didn't even have those little forks you use to get out all the crab meat, so she had to use a full size fork so most of the meat stayed behind. When we asked for the small fork the waitress sais, \"Oh we ran out a long time ago people take them.\" Is that what you expect to hear when you share out $80 for a couple of bed meals ? Crab legs prepared properly and a good quality should fall out you shouldn't have to dig and shred to oblivion. To cap off the experience was the three oyster shooters we got that were basically tiny bloody marys with an oyster thrown in. the ones I usually get at other places have some tomato juice cocktail sauce and horseradish and some type of garnish.. this looked like something my kid would make and they were warm. I wish I had taken a picture. And oh yes we had the beg for bread and wait and wait and wait until the food was cold. I think it'll be another 22 years before I go back..."}
{"text":"Located in Harrah's casino, right along video slots. When you get famished after after a long day of gambling, hopefully winningstop by this restaurant for some oysters and drinks. Friendly staff and casual atmosphere.  Food  was right on and oysters was superb"}
{"text":"Came here with a group of 8 and waited about 15 minutes for a table on a Saturday evening during EDC weekend, tucked inside Harrahs right next to their casino floor.   We ordered Oysters,  Scallops, risotto, and a bunch of other things but I honestly do not remember!   I do remember that everything was pretty good!  However I do remember the oysters had a good amount of dirt on it."}
{"text":"So supposedly this is the best place for oysters. A few of us met up here for lunch. The oysters were pretty good, but it's not like I could fill up on it so we ordered a bunch of other appetizers. The tuna roll was not very good, but the crabcakes dipped in the sauce were good, and the deep fried oysters were pretty good. It's also in Harrah's which you can easily miss if you do not know how to get here. We ordered key lime pie for dessert that tasted like cheesecake with a hint of lime. Not bad for key lime pie for the first time."}
{"text":"This review is strictly based off the quality of food and the service. Here we go!!!!!!  So I've been craving Pan Roast ever since I tried it at PALACE STATION. Being that I get off work around 1:30pm, I knew the line would be........ -_- lol. Let's just say \"ain't nobody got time for that\" on an empty stomach! I searched and searched and stumbled upon the Oyster Bar at Sunset Station. Well what do you know?!?!?! It's only 10 minutes from my job and the food looks just as good. The reviews are solid so I thought I'd give it a try.  I enter the bar to find there are about 4 people here. One guy is scarfing down the Pan Roast and I notice to ice cream scoops of rice! Jackpot maybe???? I get greeted pretty warmly and ask the gentleman would he prefer the pan roast or jambalaya. He recommended the jambalaya but that's not what I came here for buddy! I decided to go with my mind and got the combo pan roast with lobster, shrimp, and crab with a spice level of 8.   The Good: -Service was extremely fast -The portion is huge with 2 scoops of rice -Slightly cheaper than Palace Station by a few bucks  The Bad: -The flavor was slightly lacking the \"it\" factor -This is not Palace Station!!!!!!!!!!!  I'm going to conclude by being 100% honest. The food was not bad. In fact it exceeded expectations but...... When you try the Pan Roast at the Palace Station you'll know that it is light years ahead of this one. At first bite I was like f**k yeah!!!! But you slowly start to notice the difference as you continue to stuff your pie hole. I'd definitely come back here if I dread the wait over at Palace but in my eyes, it's worth every second, minute, and hour!"}
{"text":"Had date night with the hubs here last night. So delicious.  We shared the pan roast and it was amazing!!!! It had a great selection of seafood. Lobster, shrimp, clams, mussels, scallops, and crab alongside fluffy white rice in a creamy, buttery sauce.  Perfection! We also share an order of calamari which is lightly battered and served with a marinara sauce and a white sauce. Both dishes easily fed us both with some to spare.  The service was great and the wait time was less than five minutes.  There is plenty of seating but I recommend the bar so you can watch the chefs at work. A wonderful night with my two loves...my husband and seafood"}
{"text":"OYSTER HEAVENNNN!  Six of us came to dine here for company dinner and it surprised me how delicious the food actually was.   For 6 of us.. we definitely feasted.  Several dozen plates of oysters - all very good! Pico de oyster - had to order this twice! Cream de oyster - also ordered this twice! Pan roast - hmmm.. was good, I do like the actual OYSTER BAR PALACE STATION BETTER Alaskan crab legs - perfect warm temperature when it is served to you.. remove the shell, dip the lobster piece in the warm butter and into your mouth it goes.. *drooool*  If I'm lazy to go all the way to PALACE STATION for my oyster fix, would totally come here!"}
{"text":"Been going there for 10 years. Lobster Bisque can't be beat by any of the places I have been anywhere in the country. Seafood was all good. Licked clean plates!"}
{"text":"Had a great meal here. Ordered the seafood tower and it was fresh and delicious. Prepared perfectly.  Also had a simple but delicious Bloody Mary. Service was great. Will be back."}
{"text":"Best pan roast EVER! For a Saturday night in Vegas.. I expected at least 30 minute wait.. But the wait was only 10 minutes... Welp.. I always get hesitant  when I go to a place and the wait isn't too long. Not complaining. Just saying!  But.. How awesome is that! Ordered the pan roast. Clam chowder. And oysters. Very yums in my tums!!!!! Will definitely be making a stop here every Vegas trip!!!!!"}
{"text":"This place is sooo affordable compared to other Vegas restaurants. I had their Crab Louis Salad and that was amazing! Their oysters on the halfshell is very fresh and yummy as well. Remember to ask for the Louisiana hot sauce!  My cousin had the scallop pasta., which is made to perfection! My brother had the clam chowder for $7 and it's the best clam chowder ever!   This is open seating so grab a table. The food is really fantastic and obviously. I came here more than once!   Mouth drooling as I'm writing this review. Yummy.  Every single dish we ordered was cooked to perfection and it was all delicious!  Can't wait to go back to Vegas and I'm not skipping out at the Oyster Bar at Harrah's. They've got me hooked!"}
{"text":"Everytime I come in here we always have excellent service. We love getting Chito as our server. He's very attentive and has great attitude. Its a little loud in the restaurant due to the water but its a pretty atmosphere inside. The food is always good and comes out pretty quick!"}
{"text":"they buy gold band oysters, which are pasteurized/cooked already.  spend the money on real raw oysters.  their lobster is the fake stuff everyone uses in the city.  the cooks are helpful but all look miserable to be there and there is very rarely any management available"}
{"text":"Stayed at the Hard Rock and decided to give Oyster Bar a try for lunch.  We tried the gumbo and shrimp & grits and both were delicious!  Shrimp & grits: New Orleans style BBQ Shrimp, sharp cheddar & Andouille sausage grits.  Sweet large shrimps, great tasting cheddar grits, and large portion.  Gumbo: Andouille sausage, free range chicken, fried okra, and rice.  Slight kick to it, large pieces of chicken, enough for 2 people!  Will definitely be back to try some of their other offerings!"}
{"text":"This is a favorite for my family. The service is nothing special really. The spicy range is not very consistent. I always get the gumbo or the jambalaya. I love the jamblaya its always on point."}
{"text":"Bf and I ate there two nights in a row. The raw oysters were nice and reasonably priced: $20/dozen. They are open till 2am on fri and sat night, and serve the oysters that late, yesss! The second night we tried the seafood risotto - heaven! The wine selection was kinda weak, but I still found what I wanted. We'll be back for more!"}
{"text":"Big and juicy Gulf Coast oysters on the half shell with lots of fixings. Also tasty clam chowder. Attentive service... \"another dozen please:)\""}
{"text":"I'm a fan alright!!!!    So  moms and I had our last dinner before my gfs and I had to head back to OC . She was all about coming here. My gf's not so much until one of them read the menu after we already got there and she wished she came with us after all, Oy Vey LOL.    So I'm not a Vegas visitor  nor a visitor of Nevada period. Not like I'm a hater, just don't have the opportunity much to do so. So casinos are still new to me and trying to find this place was a bit annoying. My fault for not parking in the right place, but we wouldn't have known anyway since this was our first visit and reviews didn't really tell us where to go. So I'd say, park by the 24 hour café  entrance you'll see a sign on where to go from there.  So after scaling half the casino, we finally found it following the signs.  We walk up and it states seat yourself but the tables were either sat in or needed busing. So then we saw the bar which we originally wanted to sit in but they would only have one seat available or tops needing to be cleaned. I said let me see and we turned a slight corner and there were two tops at the bar, I just couldn't see them until I walked around. I kinda wish they had a hostess stand to eliminate the confusion blah.      So I went in and turned the corner to see if there were two bar chairs open and yes there was, I guess they couldn't be seen by this obstructed view. Once seated the chef/server came by and asked for our drink orders. He was nice and sweet ,even hooked me up when I took an order of chowder home for my sister, charged me for a cup instead of a bowl :) Thanks boo.  I ordered a cosmo and he made it. I don't think he's up on the girly drinks but it was good nonetheless :p  We started with cups of clam chowder. The soup came out reasonably fast and extremely fresh and hot. First taste and e were in love. This was the classic clam chowder we were looking for . The consistency was thick and creamy. A nice balance of clams and potato. This was beyond good and my mother and I knew my sister would love it!  Only thing that bummed us out was the lack of oyster crackers!!!! How do ya'll not have oyster crackers on deck!!!!!! I mean its a staple with clam chowder! It's ok, the clam chowder tasted so great all was forgiven :p  We also ordered little neck clams and those were bountiful. The clams were great, the broth was a bit bland and a bit tooooo citrus in taste. I bet the next day it would be better.      At first we were going to get our own dishes but the portions are HUGE, so we shared a shrimp boil. This dish is SPICY and if you take it home for leftovers, it will be super SPICY the next day and I'm so surprised my mother was able to eat them the following day.  Lots of shrimp, Andouille sausage , corn on the cob and my mom's favorite okra. I would have loved a side of rice .Again super fresh ingredients and overall a solid dish. I ordered this for her so I was willing to sacrifice what I wanted since I know driving a seafood dish back to cali the next day would not be ideal . My mom was happy and satisfied.      We were very happy when we left and we also had killer luck on the slots afterwards. I will definitely come back without a doubt!"}
{"text":"We sat at the bar so we could watch the chefs cook the food.  I came back for my own bowl of Roasted Corn Chowder with Crab.  The crab was really skimpy, maybe 2 teaspoons this time.    We were also given dinner rolls with butter and there were oyster crackers in a basket on the counter.  This was a nice inexpensive snack.  Unfortunately this Oyster Bar does not give a Military Discount.  I may have to go to Palace Station for my 25% Military Discount."}
{"text":"Tried the oyster bar for lunch seat your self was good only 1 cook on duty i wasn't in a hurry so i didn't mind the wait the oyster Rockefeller was good the bacon wrapped shrimp was over cooked the shrimp pan was also good my wife's shrimp scampi was good the service was good also I'd go back ,"}
{"text":"Menu looked good. Took a while for us to order. The service was slow. We went for the happy hour. We ordered dozen oysters and crab cakes."}
{"text":"The All-In Pan Roast is the most amazing pan roast I've ever eaten.  Chock full of seafood and fish and you can order as to your heat level (level five being the hottest and it is just perfection!).  The staff is always super-friendly and the consistency of the dishes is perfect.  If you get to the Hard Rock, be sure to hit it up!  You won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Really great oysters here (including several I've never heard of before.  All amazingly fresh.  Though not cheap ($41 for a dozen). Would have had 5 stars except the shucker did not ensure that the oyster adductor was fully severed, meaning I needed to scrap and pull the oyster off the shell."}
{"text":"My friend recommended this place to us and we are a fan now. The raw oysters are very fresh and the fresh cocktail sauce that came with it was awesome! The saute clams in white sauce was delicious too. The New England clam chowder was made on the spot. Alot of clams and yummy. It 's a great place to eat after a show. We will be coming back!"}
{"text":"The oysters were to die for! As well as the Shrimp Scampi!! Some of the best food I have ever had!"}
{"text":"Lunch time as we were walking by Harrah's, stopped in thanks to my Yelper friends!! It was pretty darned good for an oyster bar in the middle of a casino, in the middle if the desert.  We had Oysters on the half shell, New England Clam Chowder, and Maryland Crabcakes. Everything was quite good. The clam chowder was ordered by my lunch companion and he really enjoyed it! The crabcakes weren't as crabby as I like, but had great flavor (I grew up in the east coast, living in VA, MD, and FL so my expectations for seafood is probably a little high).  The waiter was super friendly. Beer was cold.... What more can you ask for?!!"}
{"text":"Ate here on Valentines Day. The staff was overwhelmed with all the patrons but the food was good.. I had the signature gumbo and my fiancé had oyster Rockefeller .., I can't complain about the food and I would go again on a night that's not so busy."}
{"text":"Went to this location in October and then again in March it definitely has gone down hill from what it was a year previous to Oct. visit.We got the oyster Rockefeller both times and it was all spinach with just little piece of oyster obvious the cook did not take any care in chucking them.March visit we got the pan roast for 2 first of all they tried to pond off on us the single serving and the mussels were all bad we had to spit them out which made the rest of the seafood bad I honestly think we received the seafood  the guy beside us sent back when we arrived because when we ordered our plate we got it 3min later and it was cold and bad.We flagged down the waiter who went and spoke to the manager he came back and said he would take it off of our bill he was very sincere apologizing for it,the manager just sat at the bar and would not come over at all to speak to us which made us realize that we will never ever step foot in this restaurant again we will spend our money at Joe's in the forum shops as they have the best and freshest seafood in all of Vegas!!!"}
{"text":"I wasn't a fan of oysters until I ate here. Worth every penny and was so close to where we were staying. It's a pretty classy bar and we had a dozen fresh oyster in the half shell. They were the biggest, silkiest, tastiest oysters I have ever had!!"}
{"text":"Maybe I ordered the wrong thing (spicy linguini w/ shrimp), but my friends had never tried the Oyster Bar at Palace Station's Pan Roast, so we tried it here.  It is not even CLOSE.  I had a feeling it wouldn't be up to par with the original.  It had a lot of seafood, but the consistency was very watery and a bit too sweet.  I got the calamari, which had way too much breading on it and was on the salty side.  My other friend got the linguini w/ clams, which was not a very large portion considering the near $20 price (more or less).  There's no wait but skip the Pan Roast here!"}
{"text":"Food is outstanding! Very flavorful and portions are huge!  Service is a lil slow but well worth the wait.  Nice selection of wines.  Prices are excellent!"}
{"text":"This place is frustrating.  For years this was the first place I went to for lunch after arriving in town.  Oysters are one of my very favorite foods.  I loved eating at the oyster bar and slurping down a half dozen Blue Points.  I would then have either their superb Caesar salad with grilled shrimp or excellent crab Louis.  But the service is horrendous.  They are understaffed and, while some of the servers are nice, here is the main problem: the servers, cooks, and oyster shuckers all share the same tasks.  It takes forever to get your food.  There is no management here whatsoever.  Worst of all, I had been coming here a lot and it got to the point where I would be sitting there for a good ten or fifteen minutes before anyone even acknowledged me.  One of the guys even seemed pissed at me for no apparent reason.  And the last - and final - time I went here, there were bits of shell in my raw oysters.  Despite some really exceptional seafood, this place does not know how to treat customers.  There are plenty of other places I would rather spend my money at in Vegas."}
{"text":"We placed a large order to go. Although the wait time was quite lengthy, it was well worth it because my family and friends loved the food choices I made, especially the crab cakes and sushi rolls. The rice was perfect to our liking, not too mushy or too dry. The staff was very friendly. I wish I could remember the server's name. She was outstanding! The place was packed but she carried on like a real trooper. We will visit again for sure."}
{"text":"My wife and I visited the Hard Rock Casino Oyster bar on two occasions.  In Sept 2017, we ordered the Classic Pan Roast for $24 and couple drinks. The food was very good and we left very satisfied. One week later, we went back and all turned 180 degrees.  I ordered the classic pan roast and it was more watery than the week before. My wife ordered the gumbo and she was not very pleased with how it was prepared by the chef.  The bill was around $50. I added a $7.50 tip.  A few days later, I discovered an increase on my credit card. The $7.50 tip was turned into a $75.00 tip. My receipt copy clearly showed that I wrote all figures correctly to include total amount with smaller numbers underscored.  My wife and I were the only two customers eating at the Oyster bar so how this mistake was made, I don't understand.  I called the Hard Rock accounting and they were very responsive to fix this mistake.  Per our emails with the accounting department, I would be reimbursed $75.00. I felt that this was justified and I went along with this belief.  A few days later, $67.50 was put back on my credit card, so the tip was taken and given to the server.  Again I was caught by surprise by the Hard Rock Casino; they stipulated in the email that $75.00 would be returned back to my credit card. If I had not discovered this error, the server would have gotten away with a $75.00 tip. I do not feel a tip is warranted.  A mistake like this should never be done to any customer. I emailed back to the HR accounting and voiced my dissatisfaction with the outcome. It's been ten days now and no response back."}
{"text":"Living up to its name, it is actual bar seating with oysters.  Imagine a bar, but with no continuous drone of voices, much better lighting, great food instead of alcohol (although they do serve beer and wine, I believe), and guests feeling much different from the consumption.  This is one of several locations scattered around Las Vegas. We decided to visit this one at the Hard Rock Hotel since it was located near the day spa where we had appointments.  This happened to be in the early afternoon on a Sunday.  This particular area seemed to be the most happening part of the casino at that time.  The staff consisted of 3 front-of-house members (one server, one head chef, one assistant) who all assisted each other in duties, and there were 2 or 3 back-of-house members who prepared other items on the menu as well as tending to other things like dishware and ice. Overall, they did a great job, as the constant flow of customers keeps them moving.  Your meal starts with house-made chips, which are a lot more delicious than I anticipated.  We ended up getting at least a second helping of those!  We ordered some oysters before our entrees (had to!)  Amazingly fresh, and freshly shucked.  I'm not an oyster connoisseur, but they were absolutely fine by me.  I had the gumbo, which consisted of sausage, free-range chicken, fried okra, and a side of steamed rice. It was hearty. The temperature and the spice both have the potential to clear sinuses.  I love every aspect of it.  I highly recommend this item over the others on the menu, honestly.  Service was great.  Everything was kept up on schedule, and the staff did a good job schmoozing with the clientele in the process.  The only downside is that they only seat up to 18 people at a time. When we got there, a group of 9 were already and were split among the available space out of necessity.  They also have a sort of honor system where they just simply have to remember and recognize whoever is next to be seated.  So, anybody who walks up has almost no idea who is queued up.  Parking:  Free in the structure.  FYI:  - If you see nobody in line, that DOES NOT necessarily mean you're at the front next to be seated.  The wait can be as long as about a half hour, and that's a long time to stand.  So, if someone suddenly gets seated before you out of nowhere, it's because they got there before you did. - Surprisingly, this is a great meal to have even before going to a spa!"}
{"text":"Great fresh oysters, good calamri  and best linguine and clams. Allways come here after the movie theater."}
{"text":"What an oyster bar! The surroundings and scenery are awesome here.   We came for lunch and it was nearly empty. Maybe three other parties were here. We all ordered the pan roast which is about $20 and totally worth it! It's probably the most popular item to get. The broth isn't as creamy as others I've been to but it definitely is tasty. Other oyster bars you might have to wait over an hour. This one wins in my books because you walk right in and it has cool surroundings. The waitress was extremely nice and helpful. Give this place a try!"}
{"text":"The server was amazing, I believe her name was Farrah. I ordered the jambalaya and it took about 40mins to come out because they only had one chef working which is odd. The food was just ok."}
{"text":"MpWe have stayed at the Hard Rock for years when we go to Vegas. The Oyster Bar makes it even better. Fabulous, fresh food and friendly chefs. Can't say enough about this experience.  10 stars."}
{"text":"Great food and service. The oysters were really tasty, as were the main courses. I got the blackened scallops pasta dish and my boyfriend got the seafood risotto and both had great flavor! The risotto had a nice strong and creamy sort of flavor to it with good seafood in it, such as lobster, shrimp, etc. The scallop pasta was delicious with a very light but slightly creamy sauce and perfectly cooked scallops! There was only one server when we went and he did a great job although he was very busy."}
{"text":"This is a little slice of buried treasure tucked in the back of Harrah's. It used to be bigger and cheaper, but it's still a really nice surprise in an otherwise mediocre casino. In fact, amid a lot of great dining options, we often come here on our visits. This last time we did a wide variety of oysters, a shrimp cocktail and a crab salad. Everything was fresh, and the flavors of the various sea creatures were really prominent. It's been consistently good as a snacking or lunch destination over the years."}
{"text":"I ordered the Bouillabaisse and it was very good.  Large portions of seafood in a very satisfying broth.  The broth is a tad salty but palatable.  The problem here is pretty bad service, the food is great but the waiter/waitress sucks here.  They spend most of their time watching TV and ignoring their patrons."}
{"text":"Noppity NOPE. The FUCKERY that Yelp has led me to. First of all, this place has no wait for a reason. Oysters ridiculously small and overpriced. Oysters Rockefeller Lol. If that's what you want to call them. Perhaps I'm spoiled in having the real thing in NOLA but this wasn't even comparable. Pretty much whole spinach and cheese just baked into an oyster. No detection of Pernod or anything else although it clearly states it's supposed to have it on the menu. AND THE GRAND DISAPPOINTMENT OF THE EVENING. THE \"PAN ROAST\". Why is it in quotations you might ask?! Because that shizz isn't even remotely close to pan roast. And it's not even related to the pan roast at the Palace Station. They're not even third cousins twice removed.  This crap concoction was sweet( ew) brothy and oh the best part... The seafood was so overcooked it was inedible.  How in the hell do you mess up a whole lobster tail, crab legs and crab claws? What a complete waste. My bf's New England boil was the same. Disgusting.  We tried to get the servers attention but he ignored us for about 10 mins. When he finally came over and asked how everything was my bf started to let him know then his rude ass literally held up his hand to tell him to stop talking. Then took someone else's order and walked away. I was fuming!!! I had to go up to the hostess and ask for the manager. She wasn't very friendly either! Ugh what a waste of a meal. We both left feeling sick. :( AVOID"}
{"text":"Just ok. We have fried oysters, calamari, and clam chowder. All were mediocre. Wouldn't return. Service was lacking as well, but considering it was busy I can let that slide. Blueberry bash cocktail was the only thing noteworthy of the whole meal. Pick somewhere else if you are used to eating good seafood. Definitely need to expand the menu options as well."}
{"text":"Best restaurant in hardrock hotel.  Fresh fresh fresh and dishes were cooked to perfection.  Chefs are super friendly."}
{"text":"Bloody Mary just the right amount of spice and flavor! Got the Cajun scallops and calamari appetizer it was soooo delicious. Big portions and great flavor. Service was great:)"}
{"text":"I am a huge fan of Oyster Bar, especially the one here located at Harrah's Casino. There's a great ambiance, and the staff is real friendly a they have a great wine list, and the oysters are pretty good!   The food and the atmosphere was on point. The service was nice and friendly!"}
{"text":"We walked from MGM to try this place. It was a hike!! When we got there we asked if we could still be served, along with another group of about 6 people. The gentleman behind the counter said he would get \"fired\" if he served us. We asked, your manager will fire you for bringing in more money and customers\"? He didn't seem to care so we left very disappointed to say the least. As much as we wanted to try your restaurant, considering the level of concern of eager patrons I don't think we will make another attempt to try to dine there."}
{"text":"The best oysters in Las Vegas. I love every dish I have tried. I live here in Vegas. Literally I come to eat every other wk."}
{"text":"A seat yourself restaurant inside Harrah's and just off of the gaming floor.  It was pretty busy when I arrived at 7:30pm on Tuesday on my own but it was still easy to find a seat at the bar. Definitely a casual restaurant!    There was a small display of fresh oysters on ice at the top of the bar and although they looked pretty inviting I was seriously in the mood for mussels so ordered a plate of steamed mussels fra diavolo and a glass of white wine.   The food was out within ten minutes and tasted great, a nice balance of tomato and spice but unfortunately they should have taken some more time to actually clean the mussels before cooking or serving as many of them still contained seaweed and other nasty looking contaminants.... Tasty but uncleaned mussels are a big no no!"}
{"text":"If you have an oyster craving, this place is not even worth the time. You'd be better off going somewhere else. The dozen oysters of blue point oysters were extremely huge and tasted wholesale.  Oysters = bottom of the barrel, bad shucking. Pico de gallo = tomatoes were not fresh. Asian oyster shooter = tastes funky.  On top of that, the service was horrible! I can see that there was only 1 server working the whole area. The forgotten waters and messed up orders can be forgiven, but an overcharged card can't, especially if the mistake was known.  The split check, half card, half cash, was mishandled. The server, Moon, charged the entire bill on the card and kept all the cash as tip. This wasn't noticed at the time because he reprinted the slip as a different amount that actually showed up on the credit statement. This problem still needs to be fixed!"}
{"text":"You can find standard oyster platters elsewhere, but the kettle specialties here are... well, the specialty, with distinct regional flavors and good seafood. Get one of the kettle specialties and some peel-and-eat shrimp for big servings of big flavor. You can customize the spice level (1-10) and you can choose what seafood you'd like to have in the dish. It'd probably be best to share an order, or be prepared to take some home! The bowls are not incredibly fancy, and they're not any less delicious for that; it's all warm, comforting, filling food.   The establishment is a bit small and not quite spacious or well-lit enough to be comfortable, but the service makes up for that. The staff are incredibly attentive and friendly despite busy evenings, and they give good, honest advice on the menu. Take advantage of the mini culinary show; the chefs and cooks prepare the food in a little area at the center of the bar, which is a great touch. It's too bad the place is a bit cramped; with such colorful food and people, it'd be nice to see and hear a little better in there, but the flavors are still worth the visit."}
{"text":"Great place but seating is first come first serve. I had the Surf and Turf. My filet was cooked to perfection and lobster was excellent. The appetizer was also great along with the fresh bread rolls. Best seafood on the strip hands down and Matt our server was on top of everything."}
{"text":"Pretty decent seafood bar. The seafood risotto is creamy and delicious. Mussels are fresh and not fishy. And they carry good steak too. I'm not into bloody steak and they have done a great job keeping the balance. Maybe I'll try the oysters next time."}
{"text":"I was skeptical because ... seafood in Nevada? Hmm..  Well, it was yummy. We ordered a bowl of the jambalaya and a bowl of cioppino (which was enough for 4 people, oops!)  The cioppino was a lot more thick than I would usually eat it, but it was amazing. So many good flavours in that bowl. I didn't even have to eat it with the rice they served on the side, all by itself was good. The jambalaya was another hit, too. It was perfectly seasoned and cooked.  The service was fine. They were busy and were accommodating as well. No bones there."}
{"text":"God Dammit! Ive been very disappointed with all the places Ive been in Vegas.  I got oysters from the Oyster bar. Hated them. Shards were stuck in the oysters. Absolutely nauseating. I love my oysters with vinegar, which isnt primarily available until I asked the waiter for some. And I asked for Old Bay. The water alone is HORRIBLE in Vegas. Seriously tastes like pool water. You can taste it in the oysters.   I ordered the Alaskan King Crab legs - They were overcooked I think. Came with potatoes, asparagus and carrots. I didnt eat them.  I wouldve given this place 1 star. The extra star went to my waiter, Joel - who was absolutely attentive to my requests. The server though, didnt know where my crab legs were going - and walked right passed me. That just peeved me because I was waiting for the longest time."}
{"text":"Great seafood and Affordable, especially in Vegas.  We had the Stone Crab Claws, which is seasonal there, so sweet and delicious.  My gf loves the oysters there and the seafood platter is great price.  The scallops were sweet and butter goodness.  Its a little bar in Harrahs with Great Seafood!"}
{"text":"So im sitting in my room at Harrahs yelping away, trying to find places to eat... and behold a oyster bar??? what? heaven has spoken to me....  so after watching phantom of the opera we decided to go back and try the oyster bar.. since i love oysters my bf not so much.. lol he wasn't really excited to go but he did it for me. walking in no body greeted us so we sat ourselves... someone came to get or order he was pleasant enough it was kinda busy so we understood the long pauses in between. what we ordered:  1/2 dozen fresh oysters: kinda small but really fresh it was really good only own side i kept getting shell in my mouth like a lot of shell... i love eating it with a splash of lemon, a dash of tabasco and a dollop of cocktail sauce with extra horseradish   1/2 dozen oyster rockafeller: my first time having it, it had a nice flavor but it was kinda overwhelming it has a nice garlic flavor and topped with spinach and some type of cheese  it was a little too much tho i do think i could have ate a full dozen add a little splash of lemon to cut the heaviness  calamari: crunchy pieces... i love how they includes the tentacles that my favorite part topped with lemon, my bf preferred the marinara i just used my yummy cocktail sauce. but it did come with a good aoili sauce as well   fish tacos: I didn't personally try it so i cant say much but my bf love it... only down part was there was too much sauce on the taco..   all in all if I'm back in vegas I'm defiantly coming back.. btw the bus boy was the niceest of them all like he was like asian and had a ponytail he was so nice.!!"}
{"text":"Quick service and great menu selection! This was our first experience with an Oyster Bar. The 15$ six-shooter with Patron is highly recommend, best money I spent in Vegas and the presentation was beautiful."}
{"text":"I had called from my room to see if i could get an order ready to go so i didnt have to wait around downstairs with a baby but they wouldnt do it on the phone. Why not..i dont get it? Not like i was expecting room service. I said id come down and get it, but nope, had to wait around for probably 45 min between the time it took to place my order then receieve it.   I ordered the clam chowder and the calamari to take back to my room which they charged an additional $2 for it being \"to go\". I dont know why i left a tip, i guess i shouldnt have after that unnecessary charge.  The clam chowder was really good though. It had nice big chunks of clams, although it could have used some more potatoes since it was mostly creamy soup.  The deep fried calamari lacked flavor. I wished places would seaon their batter or even the squid. There's no reason it should taste like nothing. The 2 sauces and the lemon helped though, but still, I probably wouldn't order the calamari again.  If im back in vegas, ill stop in for some clam chowder if i get a craving but thats about it."}
{"text":"We were happy to find a moderately priced restaurant in the heart of tourst-trap land. I ordered the Shrimp Jamabalaya. The Mrs. had the crab salad. We both were pleased but not bowled over. The service was fine.   It's in the heart of the casino, so don't expect a dull atmosphere.  Given the nearby choices, we would return here."}
{"text":"Ever been to a place that you can't stop eating even after you're full? This is one of those places.   I recommend the surf and turf. It was one of the best steaks I've had in a long time. It was cooked perfectly, something hard to find when you prefer your dead cow served rare.   The staff was friendly and great. They were constantly checking in to see if things were okay and if we needed anything without making us feel like they were overbearing.   We will definitely come back and refer everyone we know that is coming to Vegas!"}
{"text":"I was a bit disappointed by this place. My friend loved the Oyster Bar at the Palace Station and highly raved about the pan roast. He said they waited almost an hour to get a seat there at 1AM! So I decided to check this place out with him, and although this location is a lot bigger, there was hardly anyone at prime lunch time. We sat ourselves at the bar. There was an empty glass with used up lime just lying around, but we assumed someone will take care of it once we sat down.  Nope. Not the case at all. There was only one guy taking orders AND cooking. He saw us but didn't acknowledge us for the longest time. We had to flag down another waitress, who gave us water but had to call that guy over to take our order. We decided to share a bowl of clam chowder and the much-talked-about pan roast. And so he rings it up and gives us plates and utensils. My knife was super dirty. It still had dried up food remains on it.... gross.   We watched this guy cook while chatting with other customers, as well as bussing. Overall, it just seemed very unsanitary, the way he was throwing plates in the sink and not washing his hands before going back to cook.   We got the bread basket. Butter was super bland (I don't know how that's possible), so I dipped it into the clam chowder. The soup was very rich and creamy, which I did like. It was actually one of the better clam chowders I've had in a while.   The pan roast was... not the same pan roast as my friend got at the other location. Apparently, this was the \"everything\" pan roast, with all kinds of seafood stacked to one side, a scoop of rice to the other side, all soaked in a tomato-y sauce. The presentation was pretty sloppy. Yelp the other Oyster Bar and you'll see the photos look totally different. Although I did like a lot of the seafood in this pan roast, my friend said the other one was more flavorful. Don't get me wrong, it wasn't bad. It just wasn't amazing. Boo to my friend who overhyped it haha."}
{"text":"WOW! My partner and I both ordered the lobster sandwiches and had squid fry as our appetizer. The squid was lightly batter, got a lot of crunch but still tender and sweet! The crunchy peanuts on top really made the dish. As for our lobster, every bites was worth it! I have eating a lot of loster rolls and can attest that this lobster was the best! Juicy, sweet and just OH so delicious :)  Parking was not difficult, but I had to cough my way to and from the casino just to get to the restaurant.   Our waitress was also very nice and friendly. She checked in with us regularly."}
{"text":"My wife ordered the crab pan roast.  Though the brandy, tomato and cream based pan roast was tasty, it was slightly disappointing because the crab was shredded.  Also, the 2 large scoops of rice were overkill.  I fared better with the bouillabaisse that contained generous portions of white fish, clams, small crab legs and mussels in a light tomato and saffron broth. What species of white fish they use falls under the Don't Ask, Don't Tell policy.  I also received a side order of rice which I barely touched along with the industrial rolls w/butter.  Wednesday is senior day at Station Casinos so we were only charged half points."}
{"text":"The timing of our arrival proved to be impeccable because we immediately found a pair of unoccupied stools while minutes later there was a line formed. Executive Chef Bradley Manchester, former owner/chef of the now shuttered Glutton restaurant, has upped the ante by modifying a number of classic oyster bar dishes as well as introducing several new ones.  My wife went with the combination seafood pan roast that included Old Bay seasoning that she judged to be better than Palace Station's. High praise indeed.    I gravitated to the curried coconut seafood stew with jasmine rice and pickled chile, a perfect marriage of impeccably fresh seafood and curry sauce.  We were also served complimentary Old Bay spiced potato chips directly from the fryer.  Overall we thought this meal was about as good as one could expect from an oyster bar."}
{"text":"This was one of my favorite meals during my last Vegas trips. The O.B. Pan Roast is super yummy. The creamy tomato sauce that comes on the pan roast is very flavorful. The pan roast comes with white rice, which nicely soaks up the delicious sauce to eat with the seafood. You also get a complimentary bread basket and butter.   The service also was very nice. My fiancé and I wanted the sauce from the pan roast to eat with another dish, and they gave a bowl full of the sauce. We were really happy with getting the yummy sauce! If you come back within 24 hours with your receipt, you get a percent off of your next meal. My fiancé and I misplaced our receipt, but they still gave us the discount for dinner since we had come earlier for lunch. If you have a rewards card with Harrah's, the items are a dollar off.   We tried oysters, risotto, clam chower, and O.B. pan roast during our trip in July. If you try only one thing, get the pan roast!"}
{"text":"Great oysters!! Clam chowder and calamari were also very good. The crab cakes were just okay.  If you love oysters go to this place, yum!"}
{"text":"Ok,it's a Friday night. .. WHERE IS ALL THE STAFF ??!! WAITED 15 MINUTES. .for the seat Then 10 minutes for water..not waiter... 10 more minutes. .Finally ordered.  15 minutes later. ..FOOD!!! Well..not sure if the wait was ok.. But as always --the food was excellent. . Thanks to Darrell our chef --GREAT JOB! As for the station casinos greed, or totally inept management.\"F\" grade The wait outweighs the food."}
{"text":"The seafood is really fresh and the oysters are awesome. Good service. The only thing is they don't serve you water automatically if you ordered drinks. Overall, highly recommended."}
{"text":"The oysters were very delicious and fresh. We enjoyed the atmosphere. The waiter was a little bit distracted by his demeanor was entertaining. We also enjoyed the other delicious appetizers. I would come back here"}
{"text":"This is the first truly disappointing meal we have had after a week in Vegas. The food was subpar to the point that the salad was half decent lettuce and half very wilted lettuce. The drinks were not as described in the menu. All was expensive, as one would expect on the Strip, but the food was far below anything else we have tried. And the service sealed the deal - I have never seen such awful service. Eat elsewhere. It's all better than this place."}
{"text":"Great prices for fresh oysters and also the peel and eat shrimp. The main courses were OK. I was confused by mine, scallops with Cajun cream sauce and tagliatelle  pasta. It had 4 wonderful large fresh scallops on top but the it had a hand full of frozen baby scallops mixed into the pasta and sauce. My wife had a salmon dish which was OK but nothing to write home about. If we go back it will be to have oysters and shrimp but not much else. Service was questionable to be nice."}
{"text":"Don't come here for the ambiance-  not the fanciest-  but the food is amazing.   Oysters flown in daily and spectacular.   Ask for ly- he'll take great care of you!"}
{"text":"Who knew Harrah's would hide such a great place to eat?? Came here after looking on yelp for 'best rated' and 'open now'... was better than expected! Sat at the bar. Our server (Danny?) was on top of it! Quick, attentive, definitely handling the fully seated bar. Got a dozen oysters for $24, same price you'd pay at a farmers market, and they were delicious! Also had the ceviche, also good. Tried the blue lagoon cocktail. Tasty all around! Def recommend."}
{"text":"4 stars for the delish combo signature pan roast level 10 and our waitress with the brown long pony tail who is AWESOME and makes killer hurricanes! Never a wait. Never a problem with servers. Chefs/cooks are all about the business of making awesome food. We appreciate it all! Keep rocking it!"}
{"text":"Food was okay, nothing to write home about, esp if you live in Louisiana.  But biggest disappointment is the lame service.  Too slow, food was cool, and they are terribly understaffed.  We even went on a weeknight, and rather early at 6ish.   Servers (2) were also expected to act as hostess as well as serve all drinks + food.  Too bad for them, as this affects their bottom line when management understaffs...."}
{"text":"Great food at Great prices! !! Sooo I'm a \"HUGE\" fan of Palace Station Oyster bar (they should pay me for as much as I promote them) and while this was similar it has its own taste and twist on things. I'll get right to it;  The Food: The shrimp and Grits 5/5- were a must get! , the grits were creamy, cheesy and had lots of flavor topped with 4-5 jumbo shrimp in a smoky light bbq sauce,  yummm so far best shrimp and grits in Vegas that I've tried. ..and I've been searching!  \"All In\" Pan Roast 4/5- deep rich thick and creamy tomato base with bursting cajun flavors!  This had lobster (whole lobster tail), shrimp (4-5)and lots of BIG lump crab pieces and a side of rice on the side.  The only reason I gave a 4 was because the lobster n shrimp were a bit overcooked,  but it was still VERY good!  Atmosphere- it's located in the newer part of Hard Rock so kind of quiet right now, maybe because it's kind of hidden located right off the garage next to Harmon. 20 or so Bar seating with a restaurant like feel. There was no line on Friday night which was great because we had just left a two hour line at Palace Station.   Overall I give this place a 5/5, I'm a huge Foodie and always trying new places, Palace is still my number 1 but this place will definitely get my visit a couple more times! !"}
{"text":"Came here for the first time today for lunch and I must say this is the best lunch I've had in awhile. when we came in there was no wait time -we got to sit down immediately which I thought was convenient, we ordered the étouffée and a dozen oysters on the half shell, our server Jonathan was very informative and quick to serve everything, very friendly and charming! I've eaten oysters at some of the best seafood joints in Vegas and I've got to say I'm impressed by this place. The étouffée was very delicious, as were the clams. Favorite part about this place? the prices were reasonable too! DEFINATLEY COMING BACK:)"}
{"text":"I love this little restaurant located in Sunset Station. Their fire grilled oysters are to die for. I've tried various other dishes but the oysters are what continue to draw me in.   Sep 20th. Update...  So now I'm realizing that the quality of service is dependent on the chef working that night. Out of 5 visits the one from tonight was sub par. The tall head chef dressed in white had zero personality and seemed to not want to be there. The other nicer chef dressed in black that we're used to seeing all the time is outstanding and he makes us want to visit because we get superb service. The tall chef from tonight also made a rude comment about all the \"old people\" that were out tonight and even though we were surrounded by Seniors he didn't speak low enough for them NOT to hear him. He didn't have manners or understand subtlety. I pray that he's not there on my next visit because if he is, my friend and I will head to the M casino instead.   So note:  Tall Head Chef dressed in White with attitude = run.  Shorter Head Chef dressed in all Black with a smile = stay and enjoy.  Also tonight our usually well cooked grilled oysters were undercooked and some were a bit too gushy for our liking. That's the whole purpose of buying them grilled..if we wanted them more on the raw side we would have just ordered raw but we dislike raw hence ordering them grilled. :/ Should not be a hard concept to grasp for any cook. Only on this night with the bad head chef did we not enjoy our Oysters like we usually do."}
{"text":"Yummmm. The Alaskan chowder is my go to here. The best times to go are between midnight-3AM otherwise you're looking at a long line wait"}
{"text":"food was excellent! did not expect it to be great maybe just ok...boy were we wrong!"}
{"text":"Oyster Bar at Palace Station Hotel & Casino always has a line because they are good and they only have 14 seats there. This Oyster Bar is located inside Harrah's Las Vegas Hotel & Casino. They have a lot more seats and there wasn't a wait when we went. It's also on the Strip so it's easy access for those staying on the Strip. I love the location and the fact that there wasn't a wait.   We opted to sit on a table versus a high top and counter seating. Customer service was decent but nothing special. He did bring menus, water and bread promptly. Mink and Nadine seemed to have enjoyed the bread. We just came in for oysters so we ordered a dozen oysters on the half shell to share. For me, I thought it went best with their Iguana Gold \"Golden Habanero\" hot sauce. Oysters were ok and needed condiments to finish.   Mink was thirsty and wanted a virgin lava flow or something similar. They didn't really have nonalcoholic drinks on the menu aside from Red Bull, bottled water, soft drinks, coffee or tea. She didn't want any of those so we told our server. He talked to the bartender and they made her a virgin cocktail just for her. That's a half star bump up so 3.5 stars."}
{"text":"This used to be one of my favorite places in Vegas to eat. The Cajun scallops were always incredible.  Tonight, everything changed for me.  Took 30 minutes to get a table bussed, 45 to get my food, the scallops were absolutely rubber.  I had to send it back it was so bad. One server said the main chef was on vacation and the new one isn't working out well, another said the chef wasn't working here anymore.   Sad to see a shining star dim."}
{"text":"Really good Cajun style boils and pots. Fresh made in front of you in a bar setting. Large portions that can be split. Fresh seafood and oysters. All the pan roasts are good. Can be crowded and wait times so go early."}
{"text":"My wife and I are fans of the crab pan roast at the Palace Station Oyster Bar, and we've been eating there for years whenever we go to Vegas.  However, we hate the long lines, so after hearing a rumor that the basic recipe for the pan roast is similar for all the Station Casinos, we decided to try the Oyster Bar at Sunset Station.    This restaurant was much larger with tables as well as seating at the bar, and best of all there was no wait.  I ordered the crab pan roast, and my wife ordered the Manhattan clam chowder and bouillabaisse just to try something different.  The presentation of the food was a little different, but honestly, I could not taste any difference between the pan roast here and the one at Palace Station.  It still had the same rich, creamy, spicy broth with ample amounts of crab meat.  My wife said that she tasted a slight difference, but agreed that they probably used the same basic recipe.  Her bouillabaisse was also good with fresh crab legs, mussels, clams, and huge shrimp.  The clam chowder was good, but a little on the salty side. The service was also very welcoming and attentive.  Over the years we've tried the pan roasts at numerous other oyster bars in Vegas and Reno, and nothing has ever come close to the one in Palace Station until now.  And without the long lines, it has become much easier to come here to enjoy the amazing crab pan roast."}
{"text":"I love this place! Every time I come to Vegas I have to stop by here and get the grilled Parmesan and garlic oysters - the best I've ever had. And the flash fried calamari is awesome (abnormally large pieces) especially since it's only an appetizer. Plus the service is great and the environment is casual so it's much easier to be in and out and back to partying it up on the strip!"}
{"text":"My go-to if I'm craving oysters without waiting in a long line or going to a buffet. I've never had to wait in a long line here. It's not a well known spot, or at least, not in comparison to any other places that serve oysters. They have a pretty large menu and different selection of oysters at various prices. Every time I've been here, I've been more than satisfied. Oysters taste great, pretty fresh and they are a good size. It's Vegas priced so you can easily spend up and over $100 here between two people if you are really hungry or a huge seafood person."}
{"text":"The food is sublime. I was surprised to find this gem in Harrahs, but I'm so glad I did. The service is friendly and attentive and the prices were expected for seafood. The flavors, seasonings were amazingly one of the best I have tasted. I will definitely be going back, and now that I'm home the cravings have hit and my mind is consumed with the deliciousness of the bouillabaisse, wish they shipped...lol!"}
{"text":"This bar is awesome. I love Laura as a waitress and come here alot. The food is nice and you dont have to like seafood to be accommodated. A plus. Clean and good music."}
{"text":"We decided to have my birthday dinner here and we left after the appetizers. The drunk people at the bar made us feel uncomfortable so we moved ( I know it's Vegas, but it was bad). The service was non existent; after we ordered our oysters ( there  was only one option, and no description) we decided it wasn't even worth paying for any more food. So we paid and left.   The oysters were shucked poorly, the cocktail sauce was more like ketchup and when we asked for oyster forks (because they definitely didn't bring any) we got \"but why\" look. Oysters were average, but cost $32.00 a dozen."}
{"text":"Wow Someone reviewed Penazzi? Hehehe ok so I just had the Crab Cake here...Mind you it was to go? But it was Yum. Been here before...had Oyster shooters or two....The staff was nice. Even to a guy like me. Mind you I can be a jerk. Definitely cool people. I liked to watch this one tall girl shuck. Yea she was definitely a good shucker. I've never seen anyone shuck so fast. I wish I can shuck that accurately. I try to shuck with skill. But back to the food. Great seafood. Scampi good. Calamari - YUM. So Harrah's is finally comin up some more. So if you don't know where Penazzi's is - GO INSIDE HARRAH'S ask directions, then later you can go to Carnival Court and Get drunk."}
{"text":"*** PROS *** * Yum! Pan Roast with rice, lobster, shrimp and crab with a delicious sauce - hot, filling, delicious! * Fresh bread was good too! * Wine was so tasty! * One of the best meals I had in Las Vegas! *** CONS *** * Server was a little slow, but is very generous with his portions."}
{"text":"I've been here twice first experience oysters on the half shell you're wonderful and the pan bake specialty was great so much I had to take home. Second experience Cajun peel and eat shrimp are very good shrimp scampi on linguine with a lobster tail. Lobster was overcooked but the shrimp scampi was very well done. Fast friendly service both visits and leftovers to take home. I would definitely eat here when I'm at this location. Let me amend the oysters were amazing."}
{"text":"We eat here every once in awhile and with a weluvlocals coupon it seems like a no-brainer.    Started with the bucket of beer and Hot Maryland shrimp.  Since we were ordering three beers and an appetizer anyway this is really the way to go.  It's like getting the shrimp for $6 if you do the math.  There was a generous helping of shrimp, good sized ones to.  The broth they come in is a mite salty so don't plan on eating (drinking?) that.  For entees three of us split red beans and rice (fire that up a notch if you like the beans spicy) and the Bouillibasse.  Contrary to another writers experience the dinner rolls were light and fluffy and there was no problem when we asked for more.  Might depend on the time of day?  Or just luck?  Have to say it is a bit noisy in here.  Anyway, the overall experience was pleasant and the food good.  After the $20 off coupon our dinner was $34 for three of us.  In the words of Arnie:  I'll be back!"}
{"text":"The hard rock hotel has some good food!  This is the spot I was determined to hit on my stay and I knew I wanted the lobster roll.  As soon as we sat down he brought some house potato chips which were lovely, the taste of salt and vinegar.  The server was very professional and friendly.  We got to see everything being prepared behind the bar.  It was a good surprise that the fries came with the roll.  We had fasted all day and this meal was delicious.  They were very quick with our meals despite some reviews saying it's slow, but it was like 2pm if that makes a difference."}
{"text":"This place is off the meter. Awesome! The food was so fresh,& amazing. The timing of food was on point. The staff was on point! Rosie & Joel are the best! The rest of the staff was very professional, I just didn't know their names.  If your reading this & thinking about coming here, definitely go! Hands down!!!"}
{"text":"Oysters was good, had the grilled ones 2 different types. But the key lime pie was sick !!!!! Nothing like any key lime pie I have ever tasted, rich and creamy yummmm , polished that sht off while I was not even hungry anymore. Key lime is  a must !!!"}
{"text":"We've been here twice and the service is fabulous. The food is great and their Cabernet is worth it. They're very busy but the customer service is so good it  makes it worth the wait."}
{"text":"Bouillabaisse, jambalaya, chioppino, red or white clam chowders.....this restaurant is so worthy of a visit!  After attending a comedy show, we went in for a snack.  Both of us opted for the New England Clam Chowder.  To say \"fantastic!  The best I've ever tasted\" is no exaggeration!  Simply the best clam chowder we have ever tasted!  We can wait to go back and try some of the other dishes.  Located in Harrah's Hotel is no deterrent---"}
{"text":"Per the other comments I really didn't have unrealistic expectations of something in Harrah's and I've stayed there several times without dining here. Harrah's is a nice place, value priced but not where you'd expect to find anything outside of the curve. Also understand that I've never given five stars unless the food is extraordinary or the service is benchmark. So, I just had dinner with a work associated and I'm impressed enough to give it five. Trent, along with a woman who's name escapes me were gracious, attentive, honest and very knowledgeable. They get the top rating however the food was also delicious. In all, an oyster shooter, Six oysters royale which were divine, six grilled oysters with parmesan, quite good, I had the Carolina crab boil and my friend had the seafood risotto. Both were ample portions, cooked correctly and Trent even had extra garlic tossed into the boil which is something I'd acquired a taste for in Louisiana. Go for the food at fair prices (for the quality) and stay for the friendly and conversational service. I'll be back and I don't tread over the same ground often, especially around here!"}
{"text":"Love their goldband oysters. I had their Cajun peel and shrimp and it was also very good. I've had their bouillebaise and it's so yummy. This place is the bomb."}
{"text":"No No keep it moving!! My wife and I tried a few of the appetizers on the menu. The prawns on the crostini was very salty on its own. If you ate it with the small salad provided it was better (still nothing special). The Spicey grasshopper oyster was pretty good different if you want that. The fried potato encrusted shrimp were probably the best thing but could have benefited from some salt. Crab cakes were salty and mushy. We are used to our crab cake with lumps of crab. Don't expect that here. The crab cake did have a good sear but that did not make up for the mushy. The New England clam chowder had good taste to it but there was some weird snotty looking things in it. We inquired of the waiter what it was. He got real bad attitude. He never really answered he just blurted out I'll take it off.  Okay when you come to Vegas on vacation the last thing you want is a waiter with attitude. If you eat on the strip it's expensive. You should get an experience when you pay these prices to eat. In short I've eaten in a lot of places but I won't be going back. The food is just so so and I don't like the attitude."}
{"text":"I have been here two times and I can say that they are getting better with there service. The food did not take as long as the last time I ate here. It is an older crowd. I will come back again as the food was good and I really enjoyed the waitress that serviced me."}
{"text":"Food is excellent. I'm actually not a fan of gumbo but it was extremely delicious. My seafood diablo was delicious even though super spicy. I have to say though that was my fault as they ask how spicy you want your plate. The only negative is the loooooong line and looooooooong wait. You won't be disappointed by the food but be prepare for a long wait even after midnight."}
{"text":"This is definitely not the place for Oysters. I had way better and much fresher. The oysters at this place looked nasty. Let's say you get what you paid for. My friend had a terrible stomache ache after eating here. I was very disappointed. I walked all the way from the Encore to experience some awesome oysters based on the Yelp reviews on this site. I guess I should have order the other food items instead of just the raw oysters. : ("}
{"text":"We stopped here for a late lunch (I guess) and had a wonderful experience!  They probably could up their wine game, but, hey, it's in a casino.  We ordered a half dozen grilled oysters and a a half dozen fried oysters, and we were VERY happy with both.   We've had some really fine fried oysters lately here in San Diego ... the trick is just that perfect balance between a bit of crunch and the perfect essence-of-the-sea wet burst of the oyster.  Too breaded and heavy can be overpowering or gooey and bad.  Too light and the water can make it soggy.  These were, as Goldilocks might say, just right.  We normally would have gone for our favorite classic Oysters on the half shell, but read some reviews recommending the grilled ones.  I'm SOOoo happy we ordered these ... they were silky and oystery and warm and liquidy and hot parmesan-cheesy.  Amazing, and if you're new to oysters, let these win you over!  Between my hubby and I, four thumbs up!"}
{"text":"\"Oyster- gasmic!\"  [First impression] Harrah has an oyster bar?  Indeed they do. And a pretty darn good one at that. We needed a light \"snack\" while strolling the Strip and decided to go for some oysters. When in the middle of the desert right? Why not! I was sold when I found out they had my favorite-- Fanny Bay. We decided to get a dozen mixed which is usually a great way to try a little bit of everything.   [Suggestion] *Avoid the temptation to get a dozen mixed oysters and go straight for the Fanny Bay. They are by far my favorite-- small to medium size, creamy and meaty.   [Tips] *Sit at the bar."}
{"text":"No Wait!  Stopped by this local neighborhood casino to satisfy my seafood craving! To my surprise no Wait which is ahhhmazing considering I spent over an our last month in line at Palace Station for my first ever bowl of greatness.   The service was consistent and the pan roast was even more delightful than I could imagine. Chef Keith spices were on point! This pan roast was even more flavorful than the \"well known\" Palace Station location. Each bite was equally great and the shrimp and lobster pieces are huge and generous.   If your impatient like me when your hungry give this location a try I'm hopeful it will meet if not exceed your expectations.   I'm hooked!!"}
{"text":"This restaurant was a different restaurant when I wrote this review in 2008.  It is not for the Oyster Bar at Harrah's.  Interesting...."}
{"text":"This place was hit or miss.  When it was on, it was on, but the misses were significant.  My buddy and I ate here for lunch upon arriving into town on a Thursday afternoon.  There were only 2 other tables with diners, so we were immediately seated.  After ordering our drinks, we perused the menu.  It was an Oyster Bar, so I was expecting some New Orleans beers like Abita or Blackened Voodoo Lager.  No dice, it was all pretty basic stuff.  They have a full bar, so we had cocktails.  Our server was attentive but not overbearing.  No complaints there.  I went with the New England (the only kind) clam chowder and the parmesan crusted halibut.  The soup was good, it had nice big chunks of clam and potatoes.  It needed pepper and Tabasco, but I have found that most clam chowders are on the bland side, so this wasn't a surprise.  I'd order this again.  Likewise, my fish was cooked really well.  It was flaky and not overdone, and the parmesan crust was tasty, but I could have used more.  It was in a cream sauce that was BEGGING for seasoning.  This was superfluous, all it did was make the dish wet.  But, the spinach on the side was seasoned very well.  One of the better spinach dishes I can remember having.  If I were to order this again, I would ask for no sauce.  My buddy ordered the blackened scallops in a Cajun cream sauce over pasta.  When it arrived, I was jealous.  It looked FANTASTIC.  I immediately regretted my order.  But, when he tasted it, there was no flavor to the cream.  It was colored as though it had lots of pepper in it, but it was only cream.  It was actually impressive how something that looked so good could taste so bland.  So, he picked out the scallops and ate them.  The server noticed he didn't eat the pasta and asked him why.  When he told the server the issue, the server offered him another entrée.  My buddy declined, so the server got him a gratis cocktail.  I think the dish should have been taken off the bill entirely, but at least he made some gesture.  I'd eat here again, but absolutely wouldn't order that \"Cajun\" pasta."}
{"text":"I LOVE the house gumbo at this place.  It's one of my top 10 Vegas meals.  The service is great, they will remember you and your order after you go a few times.  The house gumbo has lobster, crab and shrimp for only $18.  And, it's a huge bowl, a great value.  They can mess with the spice level if you ask, I always get level 7 which is hot but doesn't make my mouth hurt.  Highly recommend any station casino oyster bar."}
{"text":"Honestly for a casino restaraunt it is great! Fresh, large oysters, great pan roast, hot, spicy jambalaya but the thing that really gets 4 stars is their bananas foster. It is my favorite dessert and I have had it all over the world and this is top 3 best ever! It comes in a huge bowl and it is absolutely delicious!!! Order it!"}
{"text":"The crab Louie is fantastic. Dennis was wonderful and friendly. Unpretentious and open late. Solid option at harrahs or the strip."}
{"text":"Thanx Yelpers for helping me find this place!! Best oysters ever.   Super good crab cakes The best oysters rockefeller  The mussels were just \"okay\", though But everything else was SO good and most importantly the oysters in an oyster bar were so good that 5 stars all the way. Plus, super big bonus for giving me a free bloody mary oyster shooter!! Really good bloody mary too."}
{"text":"I had the bouillabaisse and my husband had the pan roast Alejandra was are server everything was excellent and you must try the pomegranate mojito"}
{"text":"My Dad insisted on this place for dinner this last family trip to Vegas on Friday.  The restaurant side was actually closed with only the oyster bar open but one of the servers actually catered to our big party and seated us at one of the restaurant sections.  How accomodating.  I must say, this place had the freshest oysters I've had.  It was sooooo good.  We also had the crab and shrimp and seafood cocktail for our appetizers along with cups of their New England clam chowder.  We were in seafood heaven!    The entire party enjoyed all their entrees which consisted of grilled halibut, seafood jambalaya, blackened scallop fettucine, langostine salad w/ house dressing to name a few.    Our server was absolutely fabulous and had a great sense of humor.  Great turn-out for my parents' 30th anniversary dinner.  I would definitely come back here on our next trip."}
{"text":"Food was great. Staff was nice and on point. I'm a local and needed this spot near work. Thanks! James and Jade were awesome and the bald dude in kitchen nice job!"}
{"text":"Very good meaty oysters. Had the ones from New Zealand. Decent clam chowder,  New England.  Price for beers are decent but you can just get a free beer from the casino so do that haha"}
{"text":"Best Restaurant in Vegas!!  Always Fresh and Fast!!  Kumamoto Oysters are THE BEST!!  Very reasonably priced."}
{"text":"I never knew they had an oyster bar here. I thought it was only at palace station. Tucked away at the sunset station hotel, this oyster bar is a little bigger than the palace station one. The bar area seats probably twice as much. There are also tables which provide much more seating. Though there is no waiting to get a seat... There's definitely a wait to get your food. Because there was only one poor guy working, the wait for food was about an hour. The waiter warned us so if that happens, don't be hopeful that food will come sooner... It will take the full hour. Order a appetizer..: it comes quicker. I've tried the clam chowder and the shrimp boil. Both were delicious!  The clam chowder is really good and hearty.. The shrimp boil is spicy and garlicky just they give you bread to soak up all the delicious sauce. It tastes like boiling crab which I love. I ordered the signature pan roast with lobster crab and shrimp. My friend ordered the sunset station pan roast which comes with shrimp crab chicken and sausage. Each bowl comes with two scoops of rice and green onions.   I liked my food.. I feel like it wasn't was creamy or heart as the one at palace station. Also, serving size was definitely smaller!  I finished my bowl here and I've never been able to at palace station ( I didn't eat much of the rice though). All in all the flavors were good. Seafood was plenty but the wait time and portion size knocked it down one star."}
{"text":"I love oysters.  Since I was staying at the Hard Rock, it made complete sense to try out the Oyster Bar that had recently opened at the casino.  Although I haven't been to similar concept oyster places found at Harrah's, Palace Station, and multiple other properties around town, I can only imagine that they have very similar menus and price points to Oyster Bar in the Hard Rock.  I had a dozen raw oysters ($29) made up of what I'm assuming is a frequently, if not daily, changing selection of East and West Coast oysters (Malpeque, Chincoteague, Kumamoto, and one other West Coast whose name I can't recall).  I also had the \"All in\" pan roast ($24) made with a surprisingly generous amount of shrimp, crab, and lobster meat, which came with a side of white rice.  I washed it down with a can of Joseph James Citra Rye American Pale Ale ($8).  The oysters were exceedingly fresh and tasted of the ocean.  The pan roast was rich and satisfying.  My beer was pleasantly crisp and hoppy and one of the best tasting beers I've had in recent memory.  Oyster Bar was simple in concept, but delivered the goods.  If you love oysters or seafood, in general, Oyster Bar is a winner."}
{"text":"I'm sad to say that Harrahs changed up their restaurant management who then decided to completely revamp the menu here.  They still serve oysters of course, but they aren't as good :(  They got rid of the awesome cioppino and the bouillabaisse so there's no point in going back.  I can't believe I went back just to get the bouillabaisse and they didn't have it!"}
{"text":"Today's oyster specials feature excellent options from the Pacific NW. Only disappointment is they are served only with lemons and cocktail sauce. Would have liked a nice mignonette instead."}
{"text":"Delicious excellent food in a surprising location. I highly recommend to anyone and am looking forward to my next visit to vegas for some great oysters and crab!"}
{"text":"Definitely recommended place to eat! Awesome place to eat in Harrahs!!! I have visited this place several time in the period of 3 days in Vegas! Food is cooked by this gentleman called Raymundo, very personable and treats you like you are a family member of his and give you suggestions and very creative dish as he improvises the dish on their menu!!! OMG! All those dishes Raymundo made for me was super delicious as he takes pride of his owned cooking! I felt like I was home, a family member chef cooking my food at my liking!  This is definitely my favorite place to go now every time I visits Vegas because of this bar chef!  KEEP UP THE GOOD WORK!"}
{"text":"I don't know why I haven't reviewed this place until now. We have been here so any times and never had a bad experience or anything that wasn't good here. For station casinos. This is quality. I don't even like seafood that much and I love this place. Don't get me wrong I love crab and fish and i like clam chowder but I'm not a huge seafood fan. This place however can make u love seafood !   We usually always order ciopinno for him which I eat too , and clam chowder for me or red beans and rice. We've even had bouillabase and fresh oysters and everything is fantastic.   The ciopinno is so yummy ! What I love is they cook in right in front of you. ( if you sit at the bar ) it's in a yummy tomato base with wine and seafood ! Delish. You can make it less or more spicy depending on your taste.   Clam Chowder - thick creamy buttery base with big chucks of clams and potato. This is the only way I eat clams and I love it. They don't skimp on the clams either. I don't know why Sunset doesn't make it from scratch but Palace does. It's so good. Scoop it up with some bread with butter on it and you're in heaven.   If you're not super hungry share it in half with a friend or your mate. They will happily split it in half for you. Just make sure you sit by the bar and watch them make magic."}
{"text":"Pleasant enough on their off hours. But the last two or three times I've tried to eat here, I sat at my table waiting for wait staff over ten minutes without even being greeted. Today, the waitress not only made all her customers wait but then began greeting and taking orders in random order.  I've never written a restaurant review focused on service before. Scroll through other reviews to see this is an ongoing problem. This place is broken.  A combination of staffing and staff problems. A pleasant oyster bar but one with enough casino traffic that the food doesn't have to be great. A mess."}
{"text":"Service and raw oysters are AMAZING!!! 5 stars for this! Fried oysters and pickles are just ok...I wouldn't get them again."}
{"text":"I came here with the bf and ordered the clam chowder and the day's special, which was some sort of Japanese oyster. The clam chowder, was just alright, I've definitely had better. The oysters were really yummy. Very creamy tasting just like the chef had assured us. It was served with cocktail sauce and horseradish. I suggest going REALLY light on the horseradish, it's super strong and spicy, but adds a nice kick if you're into that.   I also ordered a lemon drop while the bf ordered the an Anchor Steam Beer to support a SF brewery, both ended up being really yummy as well. Overall, this place isn't too bad, but nothing too memorable in my opinion."}
{"text":"This may be the best seafood restaurant in all of Las Vegas! They have a variety of delicious oysters(Kumamoto are my favorite), and a bunch of great seafood dishes as well. I'm definitely going to make this a regular stop when I'm in town and regret not trying it before!"}
{"text":"If only I could give 6 or more stars... Without question, this was the best overall restaurant I went to while we were in vegas last week... In fact We went twice... First... Best oysters Ive had...bar none. Period. Freshest, overnighted daily.  Chef knows everything about his oysters and can supply you with more facts about them than you know existed.The naked cowboy and naked cowgirl oysters (yes, these are the actual names) are a branded oyster that will soon be instantly recognized by millions of oyster fans coast to coast. And the chef prepares them perfectly..  While there I also tried their new england clam chowder.. Barely any potatoes... Its all clam and again.. The best Ive had.  Chef Raymondo also served us up \"oyster shots\", some with bloody mary mix, some with a combination fat tire beer, cocktail sauce, and an oyster.  That was my first time on a shot like that... And wow! Incredible!  Chey Raymondo also prepared a grilled shrimp and pepper dish that was amazing.        I also must specifically call out Chef Raymondo as literally the best, friendliest, most charismatic chef slash server ever (when you sit at the oyster bar the Chef also serves).  When i went back the next day for lunch, Chef remembered I like Fat Tire and came right over with a 6 pack chilled on ince in a bucket.  Every time I am in vegas now I will stop at harrahs oyster bar... Multiple times!  Harrahs: great job on having the bar and whatever you do: keep Raymondo on your staff and happy."}
{"text":"We come here every time we go to Las Vegas, which is once or twice a year. The raw oysters are always fresh and worth the price. Our favorite dish is the pan roast. It's filled with fresh seafood and perfectly seasoned.  One time we went to the Oyster bar at Palace Station, only to find that kids are not allowed as it's a bar type of place, so we can't compare these 2 places.  This place allows kids, but being in the middle of a casino, the air quality is not very good (ie, cigarette smell)."}
{"text":"Talk about a diamond in the rough!! We read the reviews of the oyster bar but went to the restaurant instead.  We were not disappointed.  The calamari was tender and lightly breaded quite a large portion too (3 to 4 people).  We had a fish and pasta dish both was excellent.  The frutti de mare was a little bit spicy but good with a large amount of seafood.  The fish was scallops dusted with pistachios and sitting on top of creamed leeks.  We didn't have dessert but they looked good as they past the table.  The servers were very attentive, friendly and knowledgeable. The wine by the glass was very limited. But all and all a great place to eat."}
{"text":"The days of waiting an hour for virtually the same items at Palace Station Oyster Bar are over after paying a visit here. Sure, the other Oyster Bar has great pricing, it's going to be $5 to $10 less than here, but is the wait worth it?  In my opinion, I would rather maximize my time in Vegas instead.  The quality is about the same as the other Oyster Bar, but they portions are a tad more.  I ordered the New England steamer, the shrimp are huge, 16-20 size.  I could barely finish the dish.  Most importantly, you can just walk up to the restaurant, no wait at all.  The service is excellent and very attentive.  Another worthy restaurant to use your comps."}
{"text":"I don't know why this has such low ratings. I love this place! Most of the Oyster Bars in town that I have been too are all pretty good.   I am a seafood lover, and this place is close to home.  I tend to try to right my reviews based on some of the best things places have to offer. People will go and try out certain things that aren't as good, so they base it off of that.   The best things I've had here:   Blackened Shrimp Caeser Salad.  Clam Chowder Crab Cakes  I haven't had the Oysters here, but they reviews for it aren't amazing. But I'm not one to go anywhere and that be the first thing I order.  Everything else is pretty average here and the prices here are decent. Service has always been good and friendly."}
{"text":"several years ago, i gave this place a 3 star review for their not so great linguine and clams. at that time, i also had refused to try oysters because..i don't know.   i've returned to this place, an oyster lover and brought a group of ~10+. we all ordered the oyster samplers. i can't tell you which ones we had, all i remember are they were extremely fresh, and the kumamotos will always be my favorite. there wasn't any nice dollar oyster deal but it was worth it.   however, i have to say --- the PAN ROAST is a MUST-HAVE here, but DONT EXPECT/COMPARE IT TO Palace Station's because it's DIFFERENT. i've had pan roast at other places, but this is by far my favorite pan roast. it looks nothing like the one at palace station, there's no bright orange soup with a bowl of rice overturned in the middle, it's not thick, rich, and creamy --- it's just different in its own way, but still good. this comes in a small kettle with a bed of warm rice, and all kinds of seafood -- clams, mussels, lobster tail, crab claws, shrimp, all inside a spicy, flavorful, sauce. i could drink that sauce. please beware if you don't handle spicy well because it has a lot of heat. yeah, you do have to crack the crustacean shells to get to the meat, but it's worth it. there's a certain sense of satisfaction that comes from picking your food out of those shells. my bf and i dream of this pan roast. it is definitely pricey, with a price tag of ~$30+, but it's a good sized portion, so definitely share!   service was upbeat and friendly and you won't have to wait forever for a limited number of spots (like at palace station). there's a HUGE bar area to sit around OR several tables towards the back. who would've thought such a great place would be hidden in this old hotel? awesome."}
{"text":"Love this restaurant! Best oysters besides NOLA. Tried the seared scallops and pasta on this trip and it was amazing! I'm never disappointed at this restaurant!!"}
{"text":"2 stars for the food, and an extra star for STAR SERVICE from our waiter, Moon.  He was the only waiter taking care of the entire dining room - serving food, taking orders, billing tables, clearing plates - he's a one-man show!   We were really disappointed with the food.  My boyfriend had been craving pan roast for the longest time. I told him about Palace Station, but he was afraid of the long lines and wait, so we settled on this place.    We ordered O.B.'s Pan Roast and the fish & chips.  The pan roast base was thin and soupy.  Not creamy, not rich, and definitely not decadent.  Although there was plenty of seafood in the meal, everything still had shells on them~  You have to peel your own shrimp, fork out the lobster out the tail, and crack extremely thick crab legs.  The mussels and clams were easy to scoop out.  I felt like I was at Boiling Crab, and needed a plastic bib.  At $38 for one pan roast here, I would rather buy 2 seafood pan roasts at Palace Station for the same price.    The fish and chips were meh.  The chips were nicely seasoned and crispy, but the fish was soggy.  The fish filet was considerably thick, making it difficult eat with your hands because it kept breaking in the tarter sauce when combined with the sogginess of the batter, which didn't hold the fish together.    I wouldn't recommend this place to friends."}
{"text":"On my last trip to Vegas with my GF and a couple of friends, we decided to stay away from Buffets and try somewhere new. We always heard good things about Oyster Bar and how insane the line/wait can be. We didn't know that there were multiple locations but settle on this one as it has the fewest amount of reviews so we figured it would have the least amount of wait.   We got there around 6pm ish and we were seated right away! The restaurant wasn't empty but it wasn't jammed packed. I tried their famous pan roast and it was very different from what I had from Kettlebar Steam Cooking in Anaheim in SoCal. The pan roast at Kettlebar Steam Cooking is very rich, creamy and heavy - very rustic and very satisfying. The pan roast here was a bit more watery and had a slight sweetness to it. Not that it wasn't good, but it wasn't as good as I expected. The seafood was abundant and fresh which I cannot complain."}
{"text":"My husband and I are hardcore oyster connoisseurs. We don't order a dozen and split them. We order 5 dozen oysters a glass of wine and vodka. Cody behind the bar is gracious with drinks and plenty of horseradish for the oysters.  Lopez shucks oysters without any flakes of shell or grit. These are fresh and nice quality oysters. My husband preferred the mild Blue Points while I was sold on the South Pacific oysters that were as big as my hand. The British Columbia oysters were a bit briney like a dirty martini with 75% olive juice but I'm not complaining.   My only negative would be a lack of a bathroom. I was halfway to Henderson by the time I found it past the Elara. Bring your walking shoes, an appetite and a Kobayashi desire to down 60 oysters in 60 minutes."}
{"text":"I've been here two years and haven't tried out this oyster bar until tonight. Phenomenal service from Victor and the lady he handed us off to that was quite heavy handed with the wine.   We chatted with Jamil that told us about the bacon wrapped shrimp and walked us through his wonderful calamari making.  I spoke to the sous chef Deyon Wallace and asked him if he minded moving in with me and making fra diavlo every night. He said sure so I may have a new room mate. This guy made the most spectacular bananas foster that I've ever had for $4. Considering I ate a dozen oysters, the shrimp and lobster fra diavlo, bananas foster and 4 glasses of Pinot noir I walked away $55 lighter. That's amazing.  I had to gamble to sober up but I'll be back for the food and my new room mate."}
{"text":"Came here for some drinks one morning. My wife and I had the unlimited mimosas for $15/each which were excellent. The female bartender was very nice and attentive and welcoming. Although we didn't have any food on this occasion we would come back again as it appears they have many food and drink specials."}
{"text":"We been wanting to go here for awhile because we heard it was so good. So I took my husband there for Valentine's Day lunch . My husband is from New Orleans so it's hard for him to find Gumbo he likes but he loved this!! The portions of every thing is so much there is no way we could eat it all , we took it home and finished it for dinner. The food was great and the service was fast and very nice, we will go back again!! We both had appetizers , and main dishes  and drinks and it was only $35. Great deal!!"}
{"text":"Came for brunch before the Superbowl. I love how you can sit at the bar and watch the action.  I saw all the tips on great Clam Chowder, so I had to try it out. Awesome. Best I've had in Vegas! We tried the Peel & Eat Shrimp which had a delicious grilled flavor with seasonings and peppers.  Crab Cakes were delicious, served with a fresh salad and aioli type sauce.  And, of course, I had to polish it all off with a half dozen Oysters! Fresh & delicious!!! We'll be back, great food, service & ambiance!"}
{"text":"After our EDC trip, my boyfriend and I did not feel like eating anything. We wanted something small but nothing too heavy and filling. Not sure if it is a good idea to eat raw food after a day of not eating and a night of drinking, but we wanted oysters. As we walked up to the counter, we can smell the fishiness of the oysters. It was around 1pm and we were expecting a lot of people, but there were only about 4-5 families around us. We sat at the bar; right in front of where the chef would pry open the shells. At first, we stood in front of the bar, waiting for a waiter or someone to help us. We ended up getting fed up, so we just sat down. Nobody came to neither take our order nor offer us anything to drink. After 10 minutes, I started too waved down one of the chefs and he finally took our order. We ordered the half dozen Salsa half shelled oysters for $18. All I can say is, not worth it! I rather go to boiling crab, even though it is not as fresh the one here. But honestly, it tasted the same. Yes, the oysters were fresh and the salsa made it extra flavorful and it did take away the fish stench. But for $18, I was expecting a POW in my mouth. Nothing happened. Lame... We downed everything within 5 minutes...took another 10 to wave down someone to get us our checks. Bam $21 total...and we booked.  Next time, if I do come back, I would probably just order some clam chowder or calamari.... (the family next to us ordered them and they looked and smelled good)"}
{"text":"The hubby & I really like this place. We've gone 2 times now, the most recent trip being this last Saturday. My hubby had their Signature House Pan Roast both times which includes all 3 of the seafood choices-shrimp, lobster & crab. This last time he remarked that it's probably the best seafood dish he's ever had besides his mom's Cioppino & that's saying a lot coming from him! I had the Bouillabaisse the 1st time & the Salmon with capers & herbs this last time. Both items were excellent, prepared perfectly & plenty of food, I brought home half of the meal both times. The 1st time we went, the oysters were on special for $1 each so we got a dozen. I really love oysters & these were some of the best I've had although they weren't served on ice which I thought was odd. They were awesome though. Very large, fresh & delicious. We ordered them again on Saturday even though they weren't on special but b/c of how good they were the 1st time. This time they were really tiny & not nearly worth the $11 we paid for a 1/2 dozen. BIG disappointment.   I gave them 4 stars instead of 5 b/c of the measly oysters this last time & for the fact that I wished there were a couple more fish entrees like maybe a mahi-mahi dish or a seared tuna steak. Other than that, this place is really good & we will definitely head there when we get a seafood craving!"}
{"text":"If you LOVE oysters, then come here! The oysters are super fresh and yummy! I have been coming here for years and it never disappoints!  Raymundo is the chef that always makes my tummy crave more! Awesome chef and even more awesome is that he remembers us each time we come back!   He prepared an excellent scallops dish for me this time around and it was fantastic!   No need to say any more....this place is great for oysters and seafood!!!"}
{"text":"Wow, one of our worst dining experiences. First, the customer service. There was a sign to wait to be seated. There was one couple at the bar and four employees. They were so involved with talking to one another that they didn't even bother to tell us to sit where we wanted until four to five minutes later. The entire time we were dining, the workers were more interested in talking to one another than to tending to their patrons. We live in Vegas where the city prides itself on customer service and hospitality. For being a strip/off-strip establishment, this restaurant was a shame. We sit and the waitress takes our drink orders.  She brings water and then goes to the sink to pick basil or some herb. We sit there waiting for her to come back to take our food order- about ten minutes. We decided to start with the seafood platter for 2. We got one tray from one of the waiters. We ask why we only got one lobster tail and the other waiter had to emphasize to him that we ordered for 2. On each platter were rotten clams. My fiancé spit them both out because he immediately recognized they were no good. My platter also had clams with the poop sac still intact. They weren't cleaned properly. So we decided, since it was one of the worst seafood experiences we ever had- as well as costing over $50 to start, we wanted our bill. We asked the waiter for the check and the waitress that was originally taking care of us didn't even bother to ask how the food was. She just said, \"Oh, that was so quick. That's all?\"   I definitely do not recommend this restaurant. We will never come back."}
{"text":"Buffets close at 10pm, so after seeing the Celine show (AWESOME!) we weren't sure where to eat dinner; after looking around on yelp we decided on Harrah's Oyster Bar. Harrah's itself is kinda dumpy and old, but the Oyster Bar was pretty good. Open till 2am I believe.   We had: Crab Cakes: Eh, i've had better Clam Chowder: A+, lots of clam, thick and really good! Shrimp Scampi: Good with HUGE shrimp; more like prawns if you ask me Oysters Royale: WOW I loved these! Raw oysters with creme fraiche and wasabi caviar. SO GOOD, now my second favorite way to eat oysters (1st is au natural, raw with horseradish and cocktail sauce). Oysters Rockefeller: Also pretty good, 2 thumbs up from everyone at the table; I myself am not an oyst. rock. fan, but everyone else loved it. Fresh spinach and light cheese; piping hot.  Salmon: our friend got this; looked really good! Asian glazed."}
{"text":"The food matched the service - good but not great.      I honestly expected more of a selection of oysters when I walk into a place called \"Oyster Bar\" because that's why I go there.   They had the standard Bluepoints as part of their regular menu and three \"premier\" oyster options.  I ordered a dozen of their premier oysters on the half shell, Shigokus.  They were pretty darn good, and at $30, they should be.  Also had the bacon-wrapped scallops which were tender and juicy.  The Maryland crab cakes were also very good.  Their crab cakes were more the finely shredded type and no large chunks of crab, which I personally like to have.    For entrees I tried their special (New Your strip and fried soft shell crab) as well as their Jambalaya steamer.  The steak was good but the soft shell crab was a bit soggy.  The steamer had a good assortment of shellfish but a few clams were quite gritty from the sand.  The dessert menu was an afterthought and I ordered the Oreo cookie ice cream cake.      The service was a bit slow and the server didn't seem too knowledgeable about the handful of oysters being served.  I'd expect the waiters to be able to tell where an oyster came from and when it came in.  Is it firm or soft?  Salty or sweet?  Metallic, buttery, creamy, briny??        As an oyster bar, I wasn't terribly impressed.  Also the server added his own gratuity to the bill for me and two guests.  Really?  Altogether, with the $22 tip, the check was about $160 for three people.    Would I go here again?  Not likely.  I've had better $160 meals and I'd rather try a real oyster bar."}
{"text":"We come here all the time. The good is delicious. My favorite meal is Signature Gumbo"}
{"text":"I have been here many times and it never dissapoints. I'm from New Orleans and this is the closest to real Cajun food anywhere in town. Never thought I'd say that about a chain in a casino but it's the truth!   The etouffee is very authentic. These folks know how to make a roux. And peel and eat shrimp are hard to find around here so this is my go-to place for that necessary food element. I appreciate they ask for what spice level you want since most places don't make Cajun spicy enough and, come on, it's not good Cajun food unless your lips are burning by the end."}
{"text":"Came to the Oyster Bar for the Pan Roast--this is a have a drink and relax with a friend kind of place.  Belly up to the bar and talk to Russ while he makes your meal.  We shared a dozen Oysters on the Half-Shell, a Caesar Salad, and the Pan Roast.    If you're not sure what kind of Oysters you'll like you can get a mixed order.  Oysters are served with lemons and horseradish-spiked cocktail sauce, if you want shoyu and Tabasco they have it if you ask.  The Oysters were mild in flavor, I just wish they had better sauce accompaniments.  The Caesar was just a salad, not particularly memorable, but it made us feel good to eat some veggies.  The Pan Roast is the clear All Star.  We got the House Special with the mixed seafood.  Lobster, Crab, Shrimp, and diced Veggies are boiled in seafood stock, wine, and sauce until it thickens and becomes a consistency similar to chowder.  When the Pan Roast is ready, it's served over rice.  Rich, hearty, flavorful, and full of bites of seafood; it was plenty to share with the other items we ordered.  I definitely recommend you try the Pan Roast if you eat here, it was delicious!"}
{"text":"Loved it!  Got oyster Rockefeller and fish tacos.  Excellent!  Not to mention service was outstanding!"}
{"text":"omg soooo goood!!! I try to stop by here everytime I visit vegas.. dad loves it, boyfriend loves it, all the friends I brought here loved it..   Oyster's definitely fresh and yummy.. I prefer the regular oyster on the half shelf instead of the Royale which is topped with caviar and creme fraiche (too heavy and completely covered the fresh flavor of oyster.) I thought the shooters were fun but taste was mediocre.  Bouillabaisse is delish, lobster, scallop, clam, mussel, prawn, and grilled fish all in a saffron broth.. how can you go wrong with that!! Fried calamari is sooo good too! with a lemon/garlic aioli sauce.  All the pasta dishes are all cooked to perfection. Clam chowder is also so freaking good.. Okay you know what, everything on the menu is good!!! Oh and the portion size here is huge!   Freshest seafood plus a glass of pinot grigio.. ahh. i'm in heaven.."}
{"text":"Hello and welcome to the Oyster Bar. I have ate at the famous Palace Station Oyster Bar and can say this compares nicely. We always get the signature Pan Roast so that is all I can compare it to. Let me start by saying that although this place is busy it is not difficult to get a seat. Unlike Palace Station. The staff greets you and seats you right away, or you just seat yourself. The staff at the Bar gets your drink orders right away and bring a bread basket. I always get a beer and its always cold and glass is cold as well. Pan roast, I get a 3 and Josie usually gets a 1 in spice. The seafood meat is good proportion and the size of the seafood is good as well. Josie usually gives me some of her shrimp there is so much. The broth is creamy and spiced just right. The portion is huge so bring appetite. There are 2 big helpings of rice with the Roast, I like to take my rice a bit at a time. Some mix the rice up full into the broth. My drink was never left empty and staff checked on us continuously. (BONUS). Thanks for dining at Oyster Bar. I have been and will go back. It is a quick place to get a bite after work, before a movie or bowling. Check it out if you would rather not travel to Palace station. You will not be disapointed."}
{"text":"Yuck! I wanted an oyster shot And I wanted one with beer in it not liquor and I got 3 and each \"shot\" had about 4 oz of beer in it!!! I don't think they added anything to it other than a slimy oyster... What my idea of an oyster shot is in a shot the size of a Jell-O shot with worchestire and hot sauce pepper etc , I almost puked never again waste of $20 at least I got half of the rest of the beer"}
{"text":"My boyfriend really wanted to come to hard rock to check out the memorabilia and such. We figured we'd gable and drink (the usual in Vegas) we didn't think too much on the food.  I checked yelp (duh) and saw some really well rated spots, but this one stood out because we love oysters!   Food and drink;  Oysters (5 stars) - amazing and the waiters were so well informed! I told them we liked Kumamotos and they gave us some similar ones that I forgot the name of which were fantastic.   Pan roast (5 stars) - I don't like fish I don't like seafood in soups and I don't like tomato based soups lol. All signs point to my boyfriend picked this out for us to share and I went with it. Good thing! This stuff is awesome! Definitely more than enough for two of you get rice with it.   Complimentary salt and vinegar chips (5 stars) - If they'd bag these id eat them everyday. They were a thing of perfection.  Fried fish (5 stars) - a little compliment from the chef after we talked with him and my bf explained how he hates heavily battered fried fish. He proved to us his was excellent and not over battered at all! Super flavorful, and flaky. Can't say enough good things about this stuff.   Moscow mule (5 stars) - I had 3. Not because I needed 3 but because they were the best damn mules ever!   This should be a Vegas must try for anyone who likes seafood because the selections here are superb and the chefs know their sh*t!"}
{"text":"This use to be a favorite place until yesterday. It was my birthday. Started off sitting at the counter bar and our drink order. We asked for a 40 bottle of Kendall Jackson and he came back and said they did not have it. No problem. Ordered a 28 bottle and he brought back one glass and an half drank bottle. It was about two inches under the stem. I questioned, nothing was poured and said what about the pop when you open it and I've never seen a bottle this low anywhere in my life. He said no and insisted although I knew there was no way on earth. We just said ok and then he asked my husband what he wanted to drink. We were having wine together? He never even poured. He just slammed it down. We moved over to a table thinking we would get better service. We paid the five and plot a gumbo. Done this many times. My bowl was about half inch. Hardly nothing in it. It was the signature so there was spose to be a combo. I had no okra, no shrimp, one half of a sausage and a few lobster. My husband had a little more with more lobster than usual but hardly anything else. Many years I have come here but I will never come back again. We just paid the bill and left being the polite people we are. Wish I could show you the wine bottle! Obviously there was one or two glasses gone. Oh, he also got the wrong one and we paid 40 not 28 for it. Very very very bad service..."}
{"text":"It was our second time dining here. As busy as it was today, our server FARAH was awesome. She was the only server for 20+ people!!!! I counted. I cannot blame her for waiting a bit longer for our food. It was worth the wait. I will say that the cook was busy as well. But for Farah to wait on 20+ people, greeting and seating, gathering orders, refilling drinks and doing it with a smile... Amazing.   The clam chowder was full of clams and less potato \"fillers.\" Thick and creamy. It was one of the best I have ever had. The hubster had the signature étouffée which he devoured.   I love this place. Thank you Farah for the exceptional service."}
{"text":"Been coming to this place as a tradition on our yearly trips to Vegas since 2010 and they never disappoint us. Service is excellent, quality of oysters are on point. Look forward to dining there again. We always get a variety of the cooked as well as raw and clam chowder is a must!"}
{"text":"This place is off the hook... One of Las Vegas Seafood Secrets.... Highly recommend.... However you gotta seat at the \"Bar\"..."}
{"text":"Back to Vegas and this time we ventured and tried the oyster shots and oyster rockefellers for the first time. Very good very fresh. Great customer service!!"}
{"text":"This place has to be my favorite spot for BOUILLABAISSE it has always been made perfect . I would recommend this to anyone ,always a win win . The chef Josh Williams made it perfect as always"}
{"text":"Well if you love seafood and pan roast soups, you can't go wrong here. Plus they make a great Manhattan clam chowder and  a great New England clam chowder. Oysters are fresh and they also have the big green New Zealand mussels. Yes, they are flash frozen, but you wouldn't know the difference as they taste very fresh. Funny thing is, not many people know about this hidden gem  so its never crowded and never a wait"}
{"text":"The server Liz and the cooks Maria's,Eric and Chef Mike were AWESOME! I highly recommend this place. No lines A+++ food and GOOD advice!  Thanks guys!"}
{"text":"Ok... so here's the rub.  Not all Oyster bars are built equally.  I was told that by multiple friends, but needed to find out for myself.  Don't get me wrong, the gumbo and pan roast at this Sunset Casino location was good (3.5 stars), it wasn't food \"O\" like you would experience at the Palace Casino location on Sahara.  The cook forgot about our dozen oyster that we ordered, and we had to ask several times for water refills even though there were only 6 other customers.   It was very nice we got in within secs, VS an average wait of 1 1/2 - 2 hours at the Palace location.   Which I would say the juice is totally worth the squeeze!"}
{"text":"No joke, I would eat here every night if I could. We had a gift certificate so we ordered everything the chef recommended....quite literally. There was also a nice couple next to us that gave suggestions however I have a feeling this is one of those places that no matter what you order is amazing. You literally sit on the periphery of the kitchen so you watch all the lovely bumbling pots of shrimp, clams, oysters and the sizzling of steaks sets the stage for the cacophony of kitchen sounds. The experience on a whole was a delight of the senses. We started with Oyster Royale- the oysters tasted very fresh and I loved the wasabi roe and cream, the oysters were briney and fresh, some of the best I think I've had in a while ( I LOVE oysters!), then we had a cold seafood platter that was chocked full of tiger prawns, crab legs, lobster tail, and more OYSTERS!, the hubs got a steak (because he is a beef junky) which was cooked rare to his liking and I got a muscle pot of gold...I can't exactly remember what the name was but it had a roasted tomato sauce that was superb. I started with a bloody mary and then I had a martini sooooo yes remembering what I ate past the oysters is a bit hard, but eh it's Vegas Baby. Writing this review makes me want to plan a trip specifically so I can eat oysters again. If you are a fan of \"in kitchen dining\" and like oysters you should try this place for sure.  I am a very picky seafood eater, and have had oysters so fresh I've pulled a live baby crab from my mouth (oyster's last meal) so I know fresh seafood when I eat it."}
{"text":"Seafood food was great and good portion. Service was good. Pleasantly surprised for an Oyster bar / seafood place in a casino next to slot machines. Not considered a fine dining but with fine dining food quality."}
{"text":"Food was alright. The limited selection will make me not miss this place. I like Tides in GVR better the fact that their menu was twice the size at the least and serves the best sushi ever."}
{"text":"Items Selected: Hot Salt and Vinegar Chips Calamari \"Fries\" - Sriracha Aioli, Housemade Unagi Sauce, Crushed Peanuts, Chives Belon Oysters - Cocktail Sauce, Lemon, Mignonette Lobster Roll - Maine Lobster, Butter, Housemade Toasted Roll, More Butter with Hand Cut Steak Fries All-In Pan Roast with Rice - Loup de Mer, Lobster, Mexican White Shrimp, Blue Crab Shrimp and Grits - New Orleans Style BBQ Shrimp, Sharp Cheddar and Andouille Sausage Grits Poblano Corn Chowder - Charred Corn, Potatoes, Garlic Oil Linguini with Clams - Garlic, White Wine, House Made Pasta, Crushed Red Chile  Promptly shuttering his critically praised Glutton just a few months back, the lack of DTLV foot traffic and support claiming yet another business as nothing but bars, Eat. and Carson Kitchen can seem to survive the lack of nearby residents and a tourist population that is there only for the neon canopy and 'cheap' booze, it was not long before Bradley Manchester landed a job heading up the rejuvenation of Hard Rock Hotel & Casino, the rumors of its pending acquisition by Frank Fertitta and the Station Casinos Group seeming all the more likely as one of the first things to debut was the Oyster Bar just off the gaming floor.  Originally concepted by Marcus O'Brien and Derek Litzinger, their relocation to a local country club likely to also yield some great food in the near future, Oyster Bar at Hard Rock Hotel & Casino features the same circumferential design as those at Palace Station and elsewhere, but elongated and with more polish, the team led by Manchester and two Sous plus a busy Cocktail Waitress working in plain sight from a menu that includes all the Raw Bar Standards and Pan Roasts, plus several twists on Seafood based classics.  Greeted by Chef Manchester on arrival, his mood upbeat and description of things to come - including the nearby Steakhouse concept from Morton's - explained with great excitement, those who have not been to the casino on Paradise recently may want to stop by soon in order to witness a more open floorplan that the Chef expects to evolve further in the coming weeks and months, the former Fuel Coffee Bar now a neon-lit Dunkin Donuts soon to be joined by a Mediterranean restaurant where 35 Steaks + Martini's resides while Pink Taco is also soon due for a menu reboot and exterior facelift.    Proudly discussing the resources available at such a large property for sourcing, the vast majority of Oyster Bar's Seafood flown in daily, it was after a bit more chat that Manchester sprung to work with what was essentially carte blanche, the complimentary fresh-fried Salt and Vinegar Chips thin and nicely seasoned while Calamari \"Fries\" featured the Cephalopod sliced into strips and gently battered beneath thickened Soy and ground Peanuts, the light application of Sriracha adding a bit of heat that made the whole dish seem like something inspired by Thai cooking.  Offering six Belon Oysters on ice next, the meaty Bivalves described as \"The Rolls-Royce of Oysters\" living up to their billing with a coppery edge that dissipates with a bit of sweetness, Oyster Bar's Lobster Roll passes up on all the Mayonnaise nonsense to put nearly a pound of Butter-poached Crustacean on a housemade Roll with handcut Fries plus a variety of Vinegars and Hot Sauces, the $22 choice a better value than many found during peak season in the Northeast and easily the best tasted to date in Las Vegas.  At this point a local legend thanks to tourists up-all-night at Palace Station, it only seemed appropriate to next give the Hard Rock's Pan Roast a taste, Manchester and his team holding nothing back with an \"All In\" version featuring filleted Loup de Mer, a full Lobster, several White Shrimp plus Blue Crab in a piquant orange broth that, like the Shrimp and Cheesy Andouille Grits to follow, was not only flavorful and cooked perfectly, but more than enough to share.  Requesting a cup of the Poblano Corn Chowder based on personal taste, the use of lightly charred Kernels amidst the creamy base fortified by Potatoes and brightened by Garlic Oil, those looking for something a little more fancy would do well to request an order of Manchester's classic Linguini with Clams, the fresh noodles made on-site in the pastry shop cooked with a nice tooth amidst so much sliced Garlic and White wine that Vampires and significant others may be warded off, but well worth it thanks to both the just-cooked Clams on top and the copious amount of Bellies and Adductor Muscles found in the Sauce.    ****1/2 Located near the doors and proper ventilation, the gaming floor's smoke imperceptible from any of the high-backed, comfortable seats, Oyster Bar at Hard Rock Hotel & Casino sees one of Sin City's most well-liked Chef back in the spotlight with a smile on his face and big plans for the future while cooking up classics plus a few inspired additions at a price that is not only affordable, but essentially a bargain considering the portions and ingredient quality."}
{"text":"Our waiter was just awesome he really went out of his way and was just running around everywhere to accommodate us and everybody else there even when he seem like he was the only one working all the tables were for the food was delicious and I can't wait to go back and try all the other stuff on the menu."}
{"text":"All the roasts are very good. Wine selection ok."}
{"text":"Not sure why this place has 3.5 stars. Food quality seems to be the same as the palace station oyster bar. Their $6.99 jambalaya is a great deal! It's a lunch special so check it out. The only bad thing I can say is it took a while for the service to come to us. We were there on a Thursday at around 3:30pm so it's surprising nobody came to us. When we did get service it was really great. I think her name was Ana; did a wonderful job."}
{"text":"Great place for seafood in Henderson.  Environment: Located in the Sunset casino, I did not initially have high expectations. The station casinos do not necessarily have a reputation for being beautiful architectural achievements and despite the lackluster design of the interior of the casino, the restaurant itself does try to spice it up. Not entirely closed off, but surrounded by enough walls that you do not feel like you are eating in the middle of the sea of slot machines, there are an abundance of waterfalls which add some class and give a nice allusion to the concept of the bar.   Food: Menu is not super extensive, but does have enough variety of seafood options that no one should be disappointed with what they must offer. Their oyster selection does tend to change but I have had the kumamotos, and a New England breed and both were delicious and succulent. Additionally, the linguini and clams is tasty and the combination spicy seafood stew is a must.  Service: Service isn't top-notch, but for a restaurant at the Sunset casino I would say it is adequate, and while the staff is not entirely attentive, they are overall nice and helpful and I have never felt like I was being ignored or that service was below average.  Overall, I would come back to satisfy my oyster craving and grab a couple drinks before going to gamble."}
{"text":"Do not under estimate @stationcasions when it comes to grub. We have gone to the buffet at Sunset station and it was incredible. Tonight we were headed to the buffet and the line was really long so we decided to go to The Oyster Bar and boy am I glad we did. I think our server/chefs name was Kevin he said he had been working there for about 10 months. Awesome service if you sit at the bar they literally make your food right in front of you. I had the jambalaya and Justin had I believe a pan boil totally amazing. The guy seem to love his job love, the company he works and the food he prepared. I will definitely be back"}
{"text":"Delicious oysters, large and lots of toppings. We also got calamari, mostly rings but tentacles too."}
{"text":"This is my second time at oyster bar , the first time was at south point I think. I had so many people rave to me about this restaurant and the first time trying it I wasn't a fan at all .. I thought it was just a hype and maybe I waited for over two hours it just ruined my experience as a first timer . I decided to give this spot another try while being in harrahs and the pros about the restaurant is the wait was no longer than 15 minutes. The dining space was pretty big and the best part is if you're staying in harrahs it's no more than a 3 minute walk from your hotel to the restaurant.   While being in Vegas on our last night, my family and I decided to grab dinner here before heading out and doing our activities before going home. The host was very nice and greeted us right away and made sure we had a table cleaned up and ready for us. While sitting down our sever brought over some complementary breads and butter to start us off. I'm a huge fan of calamari so that had to be order along with  their New England chowder, pan roast , salmon and rice dish, oysters & the rossito.   I should've gotten the servers name but let's just say it was a horrible experience once again. He was very lazy with an attitude the whole time . We mention to him how horrible the calamari tasted. Some pieces tasted like it's been out for a long time and just thrown back in there, some others tasted really battered up, and lastly it was super salty. I love salty food but this was a no go for me in my books. The chowder was decent nothing to hype about. The salmon and rice seemed good because my son finished all of it. Oysters were good thank goodness everything else was just ok.   Overall, if anyone was to ask me if I would dine here again my answer will be a no."}
{"text":"Wow! Surprisingly good Pico De oysters touched off by an excellent main course of O.B.'s pan roast.  OBs has a tasty sauce mix that is both smokey and sweet.  Very good! Even the bottle beer was ice cold on a 100 degree Las Vegas day! Loved the place and would highly recommend"}
{"text":"We decided to come for a Thursday night instead of Friday since it's a ridiculous wait to be seated and then served. Guess what it was still the same. Our waiter was fantastic and he did his best to make sure we were at least attended to. But bc we filled up on bread and water, it wasn't really worth the food. We swear by the signature pan roast and the cioppino, but I think we'll wait before coming again. Over a 40 minute wait is pretty disgusting."}
{"text":"Appearance OysterBar is a twist between between an indoor cafe and a sports bar.   They have great seafood with affinity to oysters in a  casual open kitchen setting.  I likes how I could see the chefs cooking the food in front of me and the oysters being opened as well.                                                                               You can Watch the game on their flat screens.                     Staff       Friendly and casual.          Food                                                       Extremely freah and chilled raw oysters!  If you like oysters you won't be disappointed.   They had nearly 10 downy preparations such as raw, grilled,  cheesy, picodegallo, etc..  I got grilled & raw.. very fresh!  I also ate steamers  and scallops on pasta.  Everything was delicious be the pasta side was a little watery.  PRICE:     Midrang"}
{"text":"On 3/23 we arrived at Sunset Station's Oyster Bar at 4:30 & chose a table rather than the counter.  There were only 6 people there (& it seats about 40).  I ordered the Merlot which I sent back due to a taste more like Mogen David, choosing the Kendall Chardonnay instead.  I chose the seafood pasta (Diavolo) and my partner the Jambalaya w/seafood.  We waited for the drinks & water & then waited some more.  As the place was filling up, we noticed that 4 people got served before us.  We inquired a few times when we could flag someone down & were told it was on its way.  Wrong!  Our food arrived ONE HOUR after we ordered.  My Diavolo had 3 small bits of lobster, no crab at all, & jumbo shrimp (cooked just right).  My partner, who by this time was losing his patience out of hunger, finally dug in & said it was good.  The rolls & crackers are mediocre & the Oyster Bar is badly in need of a decent bread basket.  We asked for the manager & when we explained  he said that was unfortunate, but didn't offer anything. ( And that one employee told us we should have sat at the counter).   I said I felt the meal should be comped due to this disrespectful treatment & horribly long wait, espec. others getting served first & the long wait even when arriving at 4:30 to an almost empty place.  He disappeared for 10 mins. & then our server said he had comped most of the check.  We had dined there 2 wks. ago, arriving at 4:30 & having the same meals (which were very good), but waited 45 mins. for our food.  So, this is it.  We won't return & it appeared they'd be happy about that."}
{"text":"This was our most disappointing meal of our entire Vegas vacation.  We went there specifically for lobster.  Our lobster was so overcooked it was barely edible.  I will not be recommending this restaurant to anyone and we will not go back."}
{"text":"Wanted to check out the Oyster Bar at Palace Station but the wait was 1.5 hours long at 4pm on a Saturday....NO THANK YOU!  Decided to check this place out and it was an amazing idea! There was zero wait, but the place was understaffed so the service was a bit slow.   Food:  Clam Chowder- Creamy and delicious. They were very generous on the clam bits and potato. Highly recommend sharing between 2 people.   Oysters- They had different tiers of oysters going at different price. We got a dozen Blue Point oysters for $28 and a dozen of another kind that I forgot....(same tier as Kumamoto) for $35. The oysters were extremely fresh and fatty AND SWEET. I was in oyster heaven.   O.B. Pan Roast- They put a good variety of seafood in it, my favorite was the clams. The crab legs they had was a bit overcooked and so was the lobster. The broth was a bit watery to my liking, but overall the flavor was not bad.  Even though the service was slow but our waiter was super friendly and helpful! Will be back for the oysters!"}
{"text":"Absolutely delicious.   Every piece of seafood was cooked to perfection.   Execution precise.   Thank you Joel for one of the best seafood meals I have ever eaten, and trust me,  I've eaten a lot of seafood!"}
{"text":"I had the clam chowder and a dozen oysters. The chowder was very creamy and thick.. it almost had the texture of a potato soup. The bar seats around 25 or so people and there are a few tables. There a good selection of dishes. The oysters were sweet, but on the smallish side."}
{"text":"I LOVE LOVE LOVE this place. My husband and I searched the strip for some raw oysters and found some at Spago that cost us $25 for half a dozen and they were small and the sauce that came with it tasted like vinegar. WE were majorly disappointed. Well we left there and went to walk down the strip and found this little hidden GEM in Harrah's. The calamari was the best I have ever had and the raw oysters on the half shell were large and came with the cocktail sauce and horseradish that makes them so good. Great cocktails to boot. My next trip this will be a regular spot for my meals."}
{"text":"I used to go to the palace station oyster bar but got tired of the 2 hour wait every time. There's no wait here and they also have tables it basically a full restaurant vs just bar seating. The prices are a bit cheaper and they're not 24 hours.   Now the pan roast tastes basically the same except the portion is smaller by a third I estimate. The pots they use to cook it is smaller than palace station. I felt the portion was a good size and won't put you in a food coma. The menu is more extensive also. If you like oysters they also have like 6 different varieties of it. They also make desserts here like banana fosters. I definitely would come here vs palace station even tho I like palace station the wait is too long."}
{"text":"Expensive and you can get better quality oysters at Kings Fish....the alcohol is pretty good but people tend to disappear to the back of the restaurant for long periods of time....  Skip this place unless you are staying in the hotel and don't feel like going anywhere else..."}
{"text":"I love this place for decent priced seafood in Las Vegas.  I use to come here as a kid and I always get the same thing.  A cup of the New England clam chowder and 1lb of the peel and eat shrimp, cold. The shrimp is always delicious and fresh tasting and there is a ton of clams in the chowder.  I enjoy sitting at the bar to watch them make pasta dishes and what not."}
{"text":"My friend was craving for oyster and I heard Harrah's Oyster bar was good.  Upon we arrive, no waiter arrange us a seat and we have to walk in to ask for a table.   We ordered Jambalaya , Scallops, Mediterranean mussels, Shrimp, fried oyster and raw oyster.   I can only say their oyster was very good, but other foods were just okay.  I think I will only return for Oysters.  The service need to be improve."}
{"text":"I could eat here every day! Fresh fresh oysters, soups, salad, pasta .....so good! I had the grilled oysters with garlic butter and Parmesan cheese, clam chowder (boy they do not skip on the clams), I had their chef Louie salad and that was delightful, Scampi, prawns, yummy! I stayed in Vegas for a week and I think I ate here 5 times!"}
{"text":"The Oyster Bar at Hard Rock is awesome! A friend and I were meeting for happy hour and he suggested we come here. I honestly didn't know what to expect but I was pleasantly surprised. The only seating is at the bar, but it's a decent sized bar so we only waited a couple of minutes for a spot to open up. Once seated we ordered some Michelob Ultras and checked out the menu. I have to say, the menu had so many more options than I expected. Seeing that it's called the \"Oyster Bar\" I figured it wouldn't be much more than a raw bar (which I love), but there was so much more to choose from! From salads, to sandwiches, to gumbo, there were plenty of options to satisfy any seafood lover's palate. We started with an order of calamari fries because my friend had gotten them before and loved them. Wow, they were awesome! They came out with spicy mayo and I believe eel sauce drizzled on them just like a sushi roll! They were great. We also ordered oysters (obviously), and then a seafood platter. It all tasted fresh and delicious. One slight disappointment was that our beers were served in cans rather than bottles. Not a huge deal, but still, I prefer my Michelob Ultras out of a bottle, especially when dining out. Overall though I would definitely come back here, and if you do, do yourself a favor and order the calamari fries!"}
{"text":"Great Friday night oyster fest! My father picked this restaurant to celebrate his birthday dinner and it didn't disappoint. Since Tides is no longer in existence, it's nice that we can still find our lobster pan roasts somewhere! We enjoyed Wing Shots, Oysters Rockefeller, oysters on the half shell and a lobster pan roast. They were all spot on delicious. The oysters were a little on the small side, but the taste was above par. The wing shots were generous with the alcohol and went down so smooth. The waitress was nice enough to have them split the pan roast into two separate bowls for my Dad and I since we were sharing it. The restaurant was packed and busy yet our waitress managed to keep our drinks refilled consistently. We did have to wait about 10 minutes for our check once I gave my credit card, but that is my only complaint."}
{"text":"Completely amazing!!! Ate here 3 different times over our short stay! What is better then watching a live cooking show basically while you enjoy a nice glass of wine or beer! West coast oysters were the bomb!!!"}
{"text":"Its a little hidden gem if you like reasonable seafood on the strip.   It somehow gets lost in the hullabaloo of all the other places.  Loved the tuna sashimi, fresh, clean, high quality tuna.   Tried both soups and they were a bit oversalted but most people probably dont notice.  The crab cake was great.   They have a nice selection of hot sauces on each table and that makes for some fun dipping and tasting.  I do like to see what others get and talk to others about their food.   The Pan roast was loaded, loaded with seafood.  Might be nice if they could have a spicy option added to that choice.   I assume they have better choices for dessert than the Key Lime.  Was sort of a cheesecake combo and that didnt work for me.  Good thing I dont eat a lot of dessert but I do try stuff.  Ill come back and try some more."}
{"text":"Oysters were yummy because I was hungry.  Pricing was higher than expected but then oysters in Vegas what can you expect?  Nice decor and atmosphere and drinks are good.  Expect to empty a  pretty penny.  Worth a visit while in town."}
{"text":"We come here often and it's hidden away in a corner of Harrah's.  They have good rib eye steaks, cioppino, and steamed clams.  I get the clams in white sauce and I add pasta, which makes it into a delicious clam pasta dish.  Their clam chowder is also really good, but it's a huge bowl.  They also started having fish tacos, and the fish is nicely grilled and it comes with a side of guacamole.  Don't get the lobster because it's usually overcooked.  Service is great, the place is laid back, and it's a nice getaway from the hustle and bustle of the casino."}
{"text":"Worth really a 3.5 stars.  Ordered a dozen blue points, half-dozen grilled oysters, blackened peel shrimp, fish n' chips, bouillabaisse, and surf n' turf.  The grilled oysters, shrimp, and bouillabaisse were outstanding.  The others were average.  Overall food was good.  But service was a bit lacking.  We stood there for several minutes - no host/hostess to greet or seat us.  Eventually we asked a server and she said just to grab a seat.  We had no menus so had to go grab a couple ourselves.  Unfortunately, we had to catch a show and thought it would be a good place before it got busy.  The best service we received was a from a busgirl named Remy.  She was great and deserves a bonus!  She pretty much waited on our table - asked for refills, cleared out old plates, asked how we were, etc.  I recommend this place for the food but the service...I can't imagine what it's like when it's packed."}
{"text":"My wife and I stopped by on a Monday night at 8:30. The restaurant is seat yourself and was about 90% full. But we found two empty seats at the bar. There were many things that caught my eye including the large display of oysters on ice, the flat screens showing an NBA game which I had some action on, and a fully stocked bar. But what captured me was the saute station which you don't see at the Stations' Oyster Bars.  The station was in a frenzy and the gentleman manning the station was running at least 7-10 tickets deep. I would typically order something from the steamer section, but I wanted something from saute, so I ordered the pan-seared Scottish salmon ($23). With a great vantage point, I watched my order from the time he pulled the ticket until it the ticket was sold. My man came through. Crispy salty skin, moist flaky, fall apart meat, and firm, seasoned asparagus on the side.  I'll assume the rest of the dishes from the station were executed just as well.  Also ordered were a dozen blue point oysters ($23, they have other varieties if you should choose) and clams with red sauce ($17, pasta is extra). Both were delicious. Service was excellent at the bar. I'll be back to try some of the steamer dishes to compare to our standard. Even though it's a longer haul to the Strip, this place has the potential to take over as our new go to oyster bar."}
{"text":"My wife and I come here often and we have never had a bad meal. This is The Oyster Bar and you should come here for the oysters. I would recommend any of the kettle specialties also. I have had all of them, and they are all delicious. It can be busy there also, so we avoid going during the peak dinner hours.  We seated ourselves and were greeted immediately with menus. We started with a dozen of the biggest, freshly shucked oysters we've ever had there. These guys had been living the good life wherever they were from.  For entrees, my wife had the linguine with red clam sauce and I had the signature pan roast at medium spice level. Most everything on the menu is cooked and assembled in the oyster bar area and served immediately. So the food always comes out piping hot and fresh. I had seafood in every single spoonful in the pan roast.  Service was friendly, prompt, and they worked as team running food, getting refills, and pre-bussing the table. If you like seafood and shellfish, this place is for you."}
{"text":"The restaurant is really dirty. The plate, bowl, and fork are not clean. The Oysters are not fresh, kind of frustrated because it is an oysters bar. The service is not good. Feel likes no one is serving us."}
{"text":"This was my 2nd time here and the sequel was better than the first visit. Our chef was Keith and he was great, friendly and knows what the hellos going on in the kitchen. I had the Gumbo again. My wife, the Bouillabaisse and my Father in law had their specialty the Pan Roast. Lots of fun, lots of people watching"}
{"text":"Since trying the pan roast at Palace Station, my husband and I seek out other pan roast restaurants to get our \"fix\" and to compare.  We were staying on the strip and I noticed Harrah's had a restaurant of the same name so we decided to try it.  Yes it is more expensive than the one at Palace Station but it's packed with seafood.  My husband liked it so much he wanted to go back the next day.  We went there late so there was no line, they have regular tables too for those who don't like to sit at the bar type tables/chairs.  There was an additional discount if you went back within 24 hours.  In any event, the menu has a lot more items than the one at Palace Station.  Since starting this review, I've been back to the restaurant once more, still very good.  I also tried to go back to Palace Station- waited an hour and got out of line because I couldn't take it anymore so ...maybe we're going to just stick with Harrah's from now on."}
{"text":"Wow the crowd here made us wait a total of 0 minutes. Jam packed with half the seats empty. Ordered 2 steamers off the menu hoping we'd get everything, missing scallops (I ate both and looked at the bottom of the bowl for them even though the waiter told us they were [smaller]). Food was average, what you would expect out of a fancy restaurant.  Environment was a little bland, service was fine. Oysters were the only thing this place has going for it, avoid other dishes if possible."}
{"text":"Exceptional!  Oysters were on point.  I tried 4 different raw oysters (stellar bay were my favorite), then my chef Raymundo convinced me to try the grilled oysters.  First time I've had them but they are amazing.  Then I told Raymundo to give me the best dish they have and I got an amazing bowl of shell fish and pasta with a sauce that was to die for.  I was so excited with the meal I forgot to ask what it was called.  But I got a picture..."}
{"text":"Where do I start....  This oyster bar is not the same as the oyster bar at palace station. Food is not the same, pan roast is ultra sweet. Whatever hot sauce, or lemon you put into the plate cannot cover the sweetness. The seafood is whole, so you have to stick your fingers in the sauce, which is not fun. All in all, this place was a big disappointment. Oh btw, there's no line. I wonder why..."}
{"text":"My first impression was, \"Raw oysters and cajun food, I'm so there.\"  Located in the midst of all your slot machines at Harrah's, you really don't need to go anywhere else in the middle of your fun testing your luck. You won't have to take a chance with this place because the food is actually very good, and good quality, despite the fact that its not actually a restaurant but more a booth in the middle of all the slot machines. We had fried oysters and the cajun jambalaya. The seasoning for the jambalaya was so flavorful and rich, but not overpowering. They don't skimp on the shrimp and sausages (yummy) and the portions are great to share with an appetizer and drinks. It's seriously amazing how all this great food comes out of a station kitchen. The service is great, and the setup really adds to the Vegas atmosphere. Fine dining options are vast on the Strip, but sometimes you're in need of a little convenience to your fun without sacrificing great taste. The Oyster Bar is your answer!  The lasting impression? \"Quick bite pit stop, or a place to wind down, it's the perfect place for oysters and more.\""}
{"text":"very good oysters and king crab. servers were nice and food came out quick.  will be back when I'm in vegas."}
{"text":"I am completely upset I went there with a party of seven and the waitress did not bring out our entire order. I am an avid foodie and take my family out everywhere and I must say that darling in the strip is better than dining locally and restaurants like this go to show."}
{"text":"Only one server is working for almost nine tables, it took us 20 minutes to even get a menu, and longer for the food. Server was very nice and running around like crazy, it isn't her fault, but management take note, I doubt I'll be back because of the embarrassing fact that you expect one server to cover 50 seats... I have worked in F&B for 10 years and that's unreal that you ask that much of one person. Too bad because the food is pretty good, and I would like to come back."}
{"text":"FRESH and CHEAP!  Another point for Yelp!!  We came here for dinner after a short walk on the strip.  There was a sign that said \"Seat Yourself\" so we sat at the bar.  We ordered the Neptune's Martini and a half dozen Rockefellers -- very impressive.  My wife doesn't normally eat raw oysters but she tried these, and said they were pretty good!  Some dude next to us ordered Rockefellers with chopped shrimp, spinach, crab meat and bacon!  We didn't know they customize orders, so we'll have to come back and try that one!  Dinner comes with free bread.  I, personally, would ask for just the flat bread.  It's so fresh and crispy!  I wanted more raw oysters so I ordered another half dozen.  Use caution when sampling the horseradish!  As Russell Peters would say... \"It's mind BLASTING!\"  We also ordered some Jambalaya w/ Chicken.  This was very tasty!  Their Andouille and Tasso was out of this world!  At this point we had to undo our belts a few notches, and we were ready to leave... but then, there they were... Crab Cakes!  This other couple also sitting at the bar ordered them, and we had to have them!  These were pure crab (no bread), perfectly spiced!  They were a little on the moist side, but otherwise very good!  The Remoulade was the perfect compliment!  TIP:  Try it with the flat bread!  With that, we called it a dinner and left... a few pounds heavier!  Definitely recommended!!"}
{"text":"Horrible service and the food was cold I orders the steak and lobster and it was cold. I will never come again"}
{"text":"Lovely place with great choices. Definitely sit at the bar and chat with your cook/server. We met the nicest guy there who had worked at Harrah's 25 years. Watched the preparation for my lobster bisque, which was amazing, and the grilled oysters. Bravo, Oyster Bar! We will definitely return."}
{"text":"I have been coming here for at least 10 years or more. I see the same dedicated staff who are passionate about their jobs. The food is always great with personal friendly service. They always do a great job."}
{"text":"Great food but the service here absolutely sucks! We were about to walk out tonight after waiting at least 10 minutes to order drinks...them another 5 minutes to get them. People were being seated and walking out because they were being ignored. Sunset Station is a dump these days. Service here has always been lousy and its only getting worse."}
{"text":"Love this place! The food and service is amazing. Everything and I mean everything I have tried here is good. The chefs are very friendly and helpful. They are always checking on you and making sure you are okay. The atmosphere is great here. The only disadvantage is that it is located in the hotel we always stay at, so we're always gaining more weight!"}
{"text":"Same as Palace Station Oyster Bar but without the wait (same owner).   Come here to get your pan roast ($20) or your dozen louisiana raw oysters ($18).   One of the best deals in town if you love seafood and did I mention the wait?   7pm at night on a week would still be a 1+ hour wait at Palace Station.   Nope, 20 minutes... and if we got there a little later maybe 7:30pm, no wait.  Famous for: Pan roast and raw oysters!"}
{"text":"Very good had some spice to it got the 31 dollar panroast with crab lobster shrimps n scallops it was soooo Good! Will def be back here on my future Vegas trips. Only reason i docked a star was because the fact that they only have the bar seating and they usually have a wait but hey a long line is usually a indication that the food is good and it definitely was. Best one is inside the Palace station. Which is a very smokey pretty ghetto hotel but the food is worth it."}
{"text":"This place is a total undiscovered Las Vegas gem.  Low- key, no hassle, great service, reasonable prices, and delicious food!   The menu is pretty extensive that it will take you a while to decide what to order.  You can't go wrong with any of the pasta dishes.  The Diablo shrimp pasta is really good.   I ordered the Oysters Royale with the creme fraiche and caviar, If you aren't familiar with oysters, not all of them are meant to be huge, in fact the smaller the size, the bigger the taste.  If you understand that fact, then you'll appreciate the Oyster Royale. I've never tasted oysters in that style before, im used to the more typical vinagrette or cocktail sauce, it was a different and delicious taste. Make sure to add a dash of fresh horseradish to every oyster in the Royale, it makes a huge difference!    The appetizers are very generous, the seafood was fresh and perfectly cooked.  I will definately make it a point to visit the Oyster Bar again next time I'm in Vegas!"}
{"text":"Busy but great. I ordered crispy calamari, oysters, & the crab cakes was AWESOME! Great quick server. I even over-tipped him(MOON) intentionally!"}
{"text":"The raw oysters here are absolutely delicious!! I don't know what it is that makes it taste so good, but they are delicious. I heard their other location is even better.. will have to check that out next time. It was so good, my friend and I ordered another dozen oysters between the two of us - towards the end of our lunch!"}
{"text":"This is our first time here, and everything we ordered was delicious! We got there around 5pm, got seated right away. The fresh oysters were clean and of course delicious! The clam chowder was hot, prefect! Cocktail shrimp was really good & big. Fried calamari was also really good too! Will be going back when I'm in Vegas!"}
{"text":"Since we are staying at the Sunset Hotel for the holidays we are eating out for Christmas Eve and Christmas. We decided to avoid holiday traffic by staying in the hotel for meals. Sunset has a variety of places to eat-from a snack to a nice meal.   We decided tonight to celebrate the Feast of the Seven Fishes by coming to the Oyster Bar. Well, it was more like 3 fishes but still good.  We have been here a few times-as well as the sister casino, Palace Station- quite some time ago and enjoyed the food. Palace was always our go-to for gumbo but we stay on this side of town now.   It was pretty busy and we had to wait for a booth. There were high tables and counter seats-where we would normally sit-but for a holiday meal, we wanted to sit closer together.   They cleaned the table we snagged when someone left and brought the placemats that were the menus. They also brought rolls and butter which were pretty good.   We ordered the gumbo. It has a rich sauce filled with andouille sausage, okra and your choice of chicken, shrimp, lobster or crab or a special of all 3 seafood. They are all good choices. The chicken may be my favorite. I think it is grilled first because it has a great charred flavor. The andouille is so flavorful and the best part for me, and the seafood is wonderful.  Olivia was our server and was excellent. The one cook took a break so she went to get him on our food to get it started cooking since it takes a bit. She was very pleasant and attentive.   I recommend the Oyster Bar. The food is very good. I'm still not sure if it is as good as the Palace Station but it is very close."}
{"text":"The lobster, shrimp and crab pan roast is amazing! I get it every time. The food is similar to, if not the same as the famous oyster bar in Palace Station but they provide more seating so it's not such a long wait."}
{"text":"I love oysters...and I always wanted to try this oyster bar...just never got the chance cuz I told myself \"I'll only come here when I win\" since it costs $22 for a dozen oysters. I never did win though, and I just look and stare at the place...until this weekend, I just decided, WTH, I never win and I want oysters, I'll never get the chance...so I just went anyway. So much for winning!  I love the oysters. It's really good and not too \"fishy\" tasting. Pricey though, wish they had specials on dead nights or something. I would come back here if I want my oyster fix!"}
{"text":"Food is amazing.  I've been here 3 times. Ordered a dozen oysters, bacon shrimp and tuna sashimi.  I was lucky to get a seat at the bar.  Everyone I just Vegas, I make sure to stop here."}
{"text":"Wanted to try the Palace Station one forever, but never could drag my butt down there and wait in line, so when I heard there was one at Harrah's, I finally made my way there. I've seen a few reviews that said this location wasn't the exact same as the one at Palace Station, but this will have to do for now.  We arrived around noon on Friday and seated ourselves at the bar (always sit at the bar if available, definitely more enjoyable). We weren't too hungry, so we ordered the O.B. Pan Roast ($34) to share for 2 people. Food came out very quickly, and our pan roast came with a good amt of seafood (clams, shrimp, crab, etc.) and the sauce was delicious (sweet and savory) with the rice. They don't cook in front of you at the bar (like at other locations I believe), so minus 1 star for the experience.   Probably wouldn't have finished one plate on my own, but also wouldn't be enough for 2 hungry people to share. Definitely won't mind coming back to eat this again."}
{"text":"Ordered the seafood platter which comes with 3 of each: halved crab legs, oysters, mussels, shrimp and half a lobster tail. Ordered another half dozen of raw oysters since they didn't have any Rockefeller's today. Then New England Clam Chowder to warm our bellies. I usually don't eat seafood far from the ocean since I have a seafood allergy, but from the YELP reviews I went with everyone's review and took a zyrtec just in case my food allegy starts to flare up. Everything was fresh and service was prompt during lunch hour. A star off since the chowder was on the warm side.   They list on the menu that the sampler comes with brandied cocktail sauce, but there was a buttery concoction that came with our order and sparked my interest to dip cold seafood into it. It came with it for a reason, so order extra lemon aioli sauce that comes with the sampler platter. So good!"}
{"text":"Two words: Oysters Royale. Raw, spicy (wasabi caviar AND amazingly fresh horseradish?!) and perfect. A great chive creme added a layer of smoothness and richness without taking away from the crisp, cold, amazing oysters or the flavor profile intended by the wasabi and horseradish. #foodgasm (I would have liked larger oysters, I can admit it. They seemed just a tad on the small side. -0.5)  The Caesar was really tasty and, it was huge! I don't care for tomatoes in a Caesar salad, but the overall dish was fantastic and tangy and bright. No way could I finish it (I was saving my limited space for those fantastic oysters!) but I gave it the old college try. Really great.  The pan roast my date had was rich and flavorful and packed with proteins. He said his favorite was from a place up in Reno, but this was a close second. I loved the sauce and found the herbs really fresh and the whole thing fairly well balanced. It needed a bit more salt to really make it pop. Just that little something was missing (-0.5). The lobster bite I tried was tender and juicy and I was told the rest of the fish was fantastic.  Service was on point; water and tea always full, checked on us often without hovering, and always with a smile. And - WOW! - so fast! Watching them put dishes together was an added bonus of sitting at the bar.  Really a great meal, great food and generous portions, served by a great staff. Yup, I am a fan!  Caveat: we sat at the bar. I don't know if table service is the same, but I want to point that out just in case."}
{"text":"I've been three or four times now and I am impressed each time. You walk in and seat yourself anywhere you'd like. Even if you sit at the bar, you can still access the full menu and the bar stools are very cushy and comfortable! Service is always on point and they quickly come out to greet you and grab your drink or appetizer orders. They have wines like Moscato, Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, Merlot, Sauvignon Blanc, and even a house wine. They also have several beer options available and other libations like the Pomegranate Mojito, Moscow Mule, or the Cucumber Martini.   Known for their oysters, they have them on the half shell and you can get them like that, with shrimp cocktail, or even as oyster shooters with your choice of Tequila or Vodka.   Specialty Oyster choices include: Fanny Bay (British Columbia) Smooth, Cucumber finish  Kumamoto (Washington) Mild, sweet, fruity finish  Stellar Bay (British Columbia) Meaty, mild  French Kiss (New Brunswick) Briny, sweet finish  Kusshi (British Columbia) Small, clean flavor  Blue Point (Long Island Sound) Briny, mild flavor  I'm not an oyster fan, but many in my party were. Also on their menu were jumbo shrimp cocktail (Yum!), jumbo lump crab meat cocktail (Oh God yes!!), Manhattan or New England Clam Chowders, salads, and house favorites like Seafood Jambalaya (shrimp, crab, lobster, andouille sausage, mussels, and clams), Shrimp and Lobster Fra Diavolo (Sautéed shrimp and lobster in a spicy tomato sauce served over linguine), and even a Mediterranean Salmon (Olive oil, white wine, tomato, basil, capers, and butter).  They have Louisiana Seafood Boils and Kettle Specialties where most of my favorites are!! Dishes like Cioppino (A San Francisco seafood stew in a slightly spicy tomato sauce with fish and shellfish), House Étouffée (Shrimp, crab, and lobster cooked in a nutty seafood thickness with Cajun seasonings), Bouillabaisse (Shrimp, crab, mussels, clams, and fresh fish in a light tomato saffron broth with leeks, fennel, and herbs), New Orleans Gumbo (okra, andouille sausage and Cajun spices) comes with your choice of shrimp, crab, chicken, lobster, or the signature, which has shrimp, crab, and lobster in it. You can also choose how spicy you want it. You can pick mild, medium, or hot and also choose a number between 1-10.  I usually pick level 9 for my spiciness level;) It's not Cajun unless your mouth is burning!   I really enjoy the gumbo. It is by far, my favorite dish, here and I find myself craving it as soon as my feet touch Las Vegas ground! It's hard to find a place that makes real good gumbo! The roux is thick and flavorful and the rice that they serve with it is nice and thick and chewy! If you're one of those people who don't think leftovers taste good the next day, pop yourself on the butt!! Trust me, take it home and heat it up!! This shit is even better the next day!!! All those flavors really come together!"}
{"text":"Wonderful service !!!! I love the humor the chefs gives me cause I keep ordering so much.   The oysters here tasted sooooo fresh and good. Didn't have that slimy texture or super fishy smell.   O Y S T E R S   Regular oysters (5/5)  - blue something oysters. They weren't too big or too small. Perfect . They were good and fresh.  We pretty much ordered the premium oysters too. Also very good!   Rockefeller (5/5) - who doesn't love cheese and spinach on their oysters !?!? I need to learn how to make this !! It was so.... Juicy.. And buttery and cheesy.. Omg. Now I want more.   Baked oysters (5/5) - also very cheesy and yummy and juicy!!!"}
{"text":"Came here for some delicious Signature Pan Roast.   We have never been to this oyster bar and wanted to check it out along with the slots at the sunset station.   We were greeted immediately and given menus.   We sat up at the oyster bar top along with other families.   I even saw kids way under 21 sitting at the bar top so I'm assuming it's ok.   We were given free bread and we both got the Pan roast.  You get three different options of spicy: mild, medium, or hot.   I got medium and my wife got mild.   When we got out Pan roast.   Medium was not spicy at all.   I shoulda got the spicy for it to be remotely hot at all.   I tried my wife's mild and wow hers needed some spice to bring the flavors out.    Even though the spice levels weren't what we were expecting, the Pan roast was seriously good!   The portion size was big too!  I will be back."}
{"text":"I love this place . Quick items,fast service. Food is priced ok. Free parking which is a definite plus. 4 Stars are due to the staff eating on the floor while working and straws without plastic."}
{"text":"This place is just as good as the oyster bar at Palace Station. The only difference is the service is better here. You do not have to wait for hours to get a seat at the bar here as well."}
{"text":"Totally awesome food!!  The Pan Roast was to die for, yummmmmmy!! Kudos to everyone who works there!!  Oysters were da bomb very tasty!  Oysters Royale made with wasabi caviar and creme fraiche mmmmmmm yummy!!"}
{"text":"Awesome place for fresh sea food. The team os great. Ask for Chad or Matias they know how to treat you like a VIP. Yeah Man!"}
{"text":"Delicious food, great service, wonderful attitude from all the servers and chefs. So friendly.  Great ambiance and easy to locate inside the casino. Shrimp and grits dish was excellent, and the lobster roll as well. A+ for this place!"}
{"text":"A great place to get oysters when on the strip. Get the oysters on the half shell, avoid the \"grilled oysters\". They were recommended by our waiter so we tried them, they kill the flavor of the actual oyster which is what we go to eat oysters for! We received good service and the price is fair, especially for the strip. We will be back!"}
{"text":"Followed the Yelp by A.M. and stayed away from the misleading items. The clam chowder was OK, the oysters were pretty good. I went out with spouse after 9:00 PM and it was not crowded and server was very nice. First time in Las Vegas, so followed Yelp reviews when I could find them and proved to be very helpful. The service was slow because of one server only."}
{"text":"I'm a good Catholic, so yesterday my friend and I went to the Oyster Bar. We got there around 1pm, and it wasn't too busy and we sat right at the bar. We got half a dozen raw oysters and the seafood platter. I had their cosmo, it was a little weak (or not as strong as I was expecting). The food came out pretty quickly, and the crab was just so-so and a little gritty. The oysters were of a pretty decent size.  Our waiter Dominick said that we had to come back the next day to get their bloody marys and oyster shooters...we said \"why the hell not\" and ordered their oyster shooters with Patron. Holy crap. I was expecting an ounce of Patron with an oyster...no. We got 3 OUNCES of Patron with an oyster. He also made a Caesar and gave me a little bit of the leftover. It was really good, and I am not a fan of Clamato! Needless to say, it was a great way to start the night. Maybe I'm not such a good Catholic..."}
{"text":"I really like this place, but I wasn't blown away. I ordered pasta gumbo and an oyster shot. My sister had a shrimp basket and my bruddah got a po' boy shrimp sandwich. All in all our food was good, service was good, people here are considerate. Thing is, is that it is a bit pricey my gumbo was $18 don't get me wrong it was good and way to full fulling. I'd rather have small portions at a cheaper price so I can try other things like their appetizers  etc. I was good, just way to much food, but yea, at least I got my moneys worth, but I won't be ordering that no more. I'd stick to a sand which or something.   Then again, there are two other things on the menu that just might get me back at this restaurant. BBQ bacon wrapped shrimp appetizer and jambalaya. Yummmmmm!"}
{"text":"Oh, I miss this place.  I miss the oysters, the cold seafood platter, the martini's and the awesome guys working the open kitchen area.  By the end of my trip - they were just whipping up things for us to try. Amazing.  All of their fish, tastes great - not chewy and rubbery, or salty. Their soups and appetizers were great too, very delicate tasting (even though they're made in gigantor.. attached to the floor.. type pots), and their oysters called out to me almost every night I was in Vegas.  If I ever go back, I will definitely make sure to pop back here!"}
{"text":"The Oyster Bar at Texas is amazing! The food is always on point. The staff is super friendly, too. They have GREAT basket deals and awesome bacon wrapped shrimp!"}
{"text":"This is our 3rd time here, if the previous visits were anything like tonight I would have never came back!  Ridiculous wait while watching the staff walk around in circles.  I  will really think before coming back.  The peel and eat cajun shrimp were good, but the experience was awful. I  watched several other guests deal with the same issue."}
{"text":"[3.5 stars]  Oysters...freaking raw oysters. Who wouldn't like raw oysters (with my lady and those with liver disease as the only exceptions)? Oysters that are arranged immaculately in their half shell by the dozen on a clean plate displaying their luscious-naked-selves in preparation for your partaking. Since my caveman days in Vegas, I have frequented this spot to get a little extra oyster fix due to the freshness and quality as well as varieties offered here. Not to mention, it was CHEAP enough to overindulge.  But time always seems to dull the glimmer of any establishment in Vegas. At the very least, you will always eventually begin to notice some form of gradual decline like the dents and scratches that appear on a once-new car. This oyster bar is no different. If I was to review a few years ago, Harrah's Oyster Bar would have received a raving 5-star review. Now, it sits merely on a 3.5-star bar stool (instead of a throne) and has lost its luster like I would say of spots at ol'Vegas. (Packed but having an absence of a LONG queue).  The oysters are still okay but for some bloody unknown reason, the shucking has become a lot clumsier in the last year as I find more bits of shell in the oysters as I down each half shell. This just ruins the overall oyster consuming experience for me. Perhaps, they're having a bad day OR the oysters decided to go on strike together with the oyster union and extending their crap to the \"taxpayers\".  The Cioppino and the Bouillabaisse, which act as my main course after downing all those oysters, have also lost its mind-blowing flavor. I can only pout now and visit this establishment more as a continued habit than as a personal food preference.  Service still remains close to stellar and I have always been treated like royalty.  Le'sighs."}
{"text":"Delicious!!  The oysters were fresh and tasty. The pan roast was 'to die for'. And the chef was very helpful with helping us decide what to order."}
{"text":"Tucked away in Harrah's, this was a welcomed find. I have to hit it up at least once when I visit Vegas, sometimes twice. The seafood is fresh and prepared well. I'm sure they fly it in daily. I always start out with the oysters on the half shell. There are different selections and they let you know what type they are and where they're from. I then always move onto a bowl of their New England Clam Chowder. I must say that it ranks with the best I've ever had.  A lot of their dishes are prepared in steam pots. One of those selections is typically what I go for as my main course. The seafood comes out cooked well and the flavors are great in any of the dishes I've tried. Their meals also come accompanied by a great selection of breads.  When I'm in the mood for a treat and willing to spend the cash, I'll get the chilled seafood sampler. An assortment of yummy goodness sums it up. The price doesn't bother me that much because comparatively to other restaurants on the strip, the prices at the Oyster Bar aren't that bad.  If you're into seafood, this is one of the best options on the strip."}
{"text":"4 stars for their raw oysters...they were tasty and delicious...I gotta say I liked the oysters here better than at the Palace Station Oyster Bar...BUT...their pan roast here is definitely not as good.  There was a good amount of seafood, which I enjoyed, but the taste of the broth itself wasn't as good as the Palace Station and was far too sweet for my taste.  Service was good though. Would come back here just for the oysters."}
{"text":"Been eating here for years.  Fell in love with the clam chowder and the wait staff and chefs.  We became regulars on our semi-annual Vegas trips and got to know everyone by name.  Sadly most of them have been let go but that hasn't affected the food one bit.  They change their menu every couple of months but you have to get the clam chowder.  The king crab legs are also very good."}
{"text":"Visited this restaurant inside Sunset Station on Saturday 7-16-16 around 6PM.  I've been dying to try a pan roast and see what all the fuss is about.  This is the only Oyster Bar location that comes up in Yelp as \"good for kids? YES\" when you search for it.    It is indeed good for kids.  It seems like the other locations just have a bar with stools but this location has tables.  The restaurant is modeled to look like a grotto and has water features all around it.  We got a booth that had a waterfall behind it and I felt like I was a mermaid LOL   $76.79 got us two soft drinks, a caesar salad, a shrimp cocktail, two sides for my boy, crab legs, and a signature pan roast.  Service was fast, thoughtful, and pleasant. I like how our server brought out my boy's food first, because he is an impatient little thing.    $20 signature pan roast - shrimp, crab, and lobster in a savory tomato stew.  The meats were so tender and sweet and the broth was so thick and creamy.  Their white rice is sticky and fragrant and pairs perfectly with the pan roast.  I loved every bite of this.  It's making my mouth water just thinking about it!  $28 (market price) crab legs- Hands down the biggest, cleanest, most delicious crab legs I've ever eaten.  They were even scored to make cracking them easier.  They came with potatoes, andouille sausage, corn on the cob, and a nice big bowl of drawn butter.  Upon request we were given all the lemons we desired.  Two sets of cracking tools were brought to the table automatically.   $12 chilled jumbo shrimp cocktail- Very well executed.  The shrimp were huge!  It took me like 4-5 bites each to get through them. The cocktail sauce is so fresh and has a big hunk of real horseradish in it.  Made my eyes water!  It just might be my favorite shrimp cocktail of all time.   Next time I want seafood I know where I'll be coming!"}
{"text":"Gosh I love the Pan Roast!  Their number one seller! Farrah was a very nice server. I'm coming back here again."}
{"text":"my Jambalaya can be compared to Paul Purdom's in New Orleans. Chito is very attentive, took our picture, even our \"to go\" containers were the right size to allow us to play.. We will be back to try the Linguine.."}
{"text":"If I could AFFORD this, I'd come a few more times :). For a first visit, I left pretty satisfied and on a positive note. So, I'm going to review while it's still fresh on my mind -- and it'll be my first review of the 2013 year! (I posted 6 photos, as well.) I only came cause my sister got me some dining voucher comps.  WHAT WE ORDERED: 3 shooters (Bloody Mary, Asian Bomb, & Tequila Lime) $14 -- okay, these are definitely NOT my thing. My friend finished all 3. I only had sips. It's the alcohol, bleh.  Bourbon Street Jambalaya w/ Chicken $18 -- This wasn't too bad; it wasn't delicious or anything, but it was pretty decent.  Sauteed clams in white sauce -- Typical clams but it was pretty sandy. There were about 3 closed ones and I managed to open one and it was just very BLACK and sandy. Wasn't a pretty sight.  Oyster Grill (half-dozen) -- This was one of the better things I had tonight. Yum! I'd totally get it again.  Prices are definitely not in my budget but I'd really like to try the other things on their menu (i.e. the seafood platter for two) so if chance gives me it, maybe I'll be back one day...  PS: Get a TOTAL REWARDS card. The prices are cheaper by only a $1, but hey, it adds up!"}
{"text":"about $25 for a dozen of oysters which is pretty cheap and it's fresh. I reallllyyyy like like bread.. also had the tuna (soysause/wasabi) salad (don't remember the actual name) but that was SOOOO goood. I'm not a salad person (usually because i don't like salad dressing) but this salad was amazing! very salty/soysaucey which I like. the tuna was sooo good. gave me a lot of fish and it was like 15-16? so definitely recommend this if you didn't want oysters."}
{"text":"I have walked past this joint so many times and finally stopped in for dinner after a movie. We are so glad we did. Pamela was our server and she is one awesome  waitress with charm you don't see in restaurants these days.  We explained that we were not \"that\" hungry so she suggested a few smaller items. The crab chowder was delicious  (& cheap). The steamed clams were buttery and the wine pour was generous & cheap too. We will be regulars just based on this one visit. Thanks for making reasonably priced seafood in  the middle of the Mojave :)  Our thanks to Pam for a very nice evening. You make all the other servers in Vegas look like amateurs!"}
{"text":"I dreamed about the crab pan roast! Dreamy! So damn good, I want to eat it forever! Lots of crab and just the perfect amount of flavor. Phenomenal customer service and very attentive. I just love it People , no further comment.  Highly Recommend! Yes, I will be back for more!"}
{"text":"Simply WOW. I've been wanting to do an Oyster Bar for some time and didn't know there was one on the strip. The one off strip is insanely popular, so this was welcome to be close to the strip. It's at Harrahs which is across from Caesars and although the hotel isn't super popular anymore, this restaurant absolutely is. We didn't have a reservation and grabbed a seat at the bar within 5 minutes at 7pm on a Sunday. We love Oysters, and these do not disappoint. Get them fresh though as they are much better than their grilled counterpart. The Rockefeller Oysters did look amazing though and the person who got them was a big fan. We got the Clam Chowder which I think is a requirement because it's honestly the best I've had out of Boston. One of the regulars at this location hinted that we should ask for the \"Big Lobster\" which is 20oz, and comes with an optional steak. We went for lobster alone and WOW it's huge and delicious. Comes with a salad and some grilled veggies, but Joel offered us a side of creamy marinara pasta where he threw in some shrimp and it was the perfect complement. Loved it so much here and so easy to get a seat that we came twice on our 3 day trip."}
{"text":"I have eaten here many times.  I live on the far side of town and it is over 30 minutes for me to get here.  I used to make the drive happily because their House Pan Roast is great.  As usual the food was good.  My problem this time and the last is the service.  This is a small place and I go during slow times.  No excuses for TERRIBLE service.  I thought it was just a fluke last time, this time it was worse.  I guess I'll start checking out the other Oyster Bars in town.  I can get treated like crap a lot closer to home."}
{"text":"FYI, I just called and Penazzi is no longer open."}
{"text":"Three stars is only for the value. $67 for six raw and six grilled oysters with two beers is a little much.  The food quality and service was very good .  Just know that this is a overpriced restaurant in a casino.  There are better options in the area so my next visit I will be going elsewhere."}
{"text":"It only gets better! They have expanded since our last visit, they have been voted Best Seafood in Las Vegas, and the staff is still fantastic!  Ever since our first visit here we have been comparing their New England (the white kind) Clam Chowder to every other place we visit, we have tried lots of clam chowder over the years, and when it comes to Rich Buttery flavor The Oyster Bar at Harrah's Las Vegas is still the champ, other restaurants come close but so far we have found nothing better. A meal here is not cheap, but it is not outrageous either, you get what you pay for and the service is top shelf, many of the staff has been here for years and they have perfected their craft. Highly recomended"}
{"text":"My girlfriend and I were craving some pan roast and seafood.  We normally go to the Palace Station Oyster Bar for our fix, but we didn't feel like waiting or making the drive so we looked for something closer to home.  We found Sunset Station's Oyster Bar...and unfortunately the only common things that the two restaurants share is the word \"Station\" and the word \"Oyster Bar\".  First off, the wait.  The wait was an awkward jumble of people at the front of the restaurant, awaiting to be seated 1 party at a time.  There was a group of 5, and a group of 4 ahead of us waiting to be seated.  If it wasn't for the group of 4 in front of us getting impatient and leaving before getting seated, we would have been waiting for 30 minutes or more.  Lucky for us, they left, and a server walked us to 2 seats on the bar.  Next, the service.  We were greeted by someone in Chef's clothing after about a 10 minute wait while looking at our menus.  He was borderline friendly but he didn't really seem like he enjoyed his job very much.  We overheard him complaining to his coworkers right in front of us.  Very cut and dry, but his service was fine.  Took our drink order, once the drinks came he took our order about 5 minutes later.  We ordered a half dozen of Broiled Oysters, the Alaskan Chowder and the Pan Roast.  Last but not least, the food.  The Charbroiled Oysters came first.  They were pretty good, especially with the nice selection of sauces that they provide on the bar.  Next came our entrees.  The Pan Roast was disappointing, ESPECIALLY in comparison to Palace Station's. We ordered medium spice, but it was so overbearing that it wasn't enjoyable and affected the taste.  The portion of both entrees were meager, especially in comparison to Palace Stations.  The Alaskan Chowder tasted a little better.  Pretty much clam chowder loaded with a bunch of seafood.  The King Crab that it came with tasted really good, the other pieces of seafood were fine.  All in all, especially from a price standpoint you can easily do better than this oyster bar.  After spending about 100 dollars after tip I left bitterly disappointed.  The bright spot of my trip though is that we actually ordered and received food.  A table behind us was sat and waited for service for 20 minutes before they lost their patience and left.  So there's that.  I won't be coming back here, the food is fine but I find much better value and much better price points in other parts of the city.  Next time I need to exude patience and either drive a little further or wait a little longer somewhere else."}
{"text":"Fresh oyster on the half shell with wasabi cream-delicious oysters Rockefeller-I've had better Grilled oysters with garlic butter-delicious Fried oysters-o.k. Oyster shooters with tequila-my sister enjoyed though I didn't try it Service-great"}
{"text":"This oyster bar is pretty cool. Staff was pretty cool, only the girl who sat us and took our drink order seemed to disappear and drinks were slow to arrive. Ended up giving our food order to another person who wasn't servicing our area. So she gets 2 stars, and the rest of the staff 5.  Lots of patrons eating the gumbo, with one guy proclaiming its the best gumbo in town! Will have to try it next time. I had a lobster roll, and my friend had shrimp and grits. Both were pretty good, the lobster roll was lacking something or maybe too much bread from the panini style roll.   Overall, I'd eat here again and try the gumbo. Shrimp and grits was delicious too."}
{"text":"Truly a 4.5, but I'm in a good mood so I might as well round up!   I was apprehensive about coming here for dinner, but it was delicious and affordable (for vegas standards). The Clam Chowder ($7) is to die for (probably the best clam chower I've had outside of San Francisco and Monterey)! The Oysters on half shell ($23 for dozen) are fresh and sweet. I had the Steamed Clams in White Wine sauce($19) with pasta (+$2).   Overall, one of the best meals I've had in Vegas and I would definitely come back!"}
{"text":"Review of customer service not food. When we came in there was a sign indicating to seat ourselves. After wandering around the restaurant for awhile, a kind customer showed us an open seat. I hunted down a bus boy after sitting there for 15 min without being approached by any staff. He informed me the section had been closed, and they just hadn't put up the the closed sign. After lurking around the restaurant for another few minutes we left. FYI to management, people don't enjoy lurking around restaurants and people eating don't enjoy lurkers."}
{"text":"So I read other reviews about crappy service, but decided to give this place a shot anyway because their menu looks awesome. When I first arrived, it was about 5:30 p.m. I was supposed to be meeting a friend to treat her to a belated birthday dinner. I sat down and was immediately greeted by two different servers. My request for two waters was brought out right away. I was checked on numerous times while I waited for my friend. 5:45 p.m. roles, my friend was not there yet, I decided to place my order. My rolls were brought out and my order followed shortly. I had the Shrimp & Lobster Fra Diavolo. This meal was DELICIOUS! It had nice portions of shrimp and lobster; the flavor of the sauce was yummy; and it was the perfect amount of spicy at a 5 on the spice option scale of 1-10. My main server asked me how my meal was, and with a mouth full of food, I gave her a thumb's up. I thought to myself: \"Those Yelp reviews are wrong.\" So I finish my meal. My friend never arrived. I'm sitting there, waiting for some attention from one of the servers (there were two who checked on me originally). A few minutes go by, I start looking at my watch. My main server briskly walked by me without taking a glance in my direction three times. Fifteen minutes after I start watching the time, main server finally comes. She picked up the left over rolls, while asking if I wanted them. She snatched them up so fast, I thought maybe she wanted to reuse the ones I hadn't touched, so I told her I didn't want them. She asked if I was ready for my check. I told her yes and a box for my left overs. I look at the time again. No exaggeration, it took her twelve minutes to get my check and a container. As I was watching her on the other side of the restaurant during this twelve minute span, she glanced up, made eye contact with me, and I could practically see the light bulb turn on right above her head. She hurriedly went to the register, grabbed a container, and came over to me. She apologized and jokingly asked me not to yell at her as she put my food into the container. She then said something like \"she just did not show up\" and I thought she was referring to herself in the third person, joking around about how she forgot about me. So I told her I had been watching her just walk all around without coming over to me. And she said, \"oh no...i was talking about your friend.\" I was so irritated by the service at this point, I forgot all about being stood up. I was actually over it by the time I ordered because my friend not showing up saved me over $20.00. Anyway, I quickly grabbed my credit card and put it with the bill, before she had the chance to take off again. She took the my card and my bill, rang me up, and brought back the receipt within about a minute or two. Normally, even when overly drinking, I wrap my receipt around my card and put the two together in my wallet. I take the receipts out when I get home to enter into my budget spreadsheet. This time I got home, took my receipts out...no card. I have no idea if, with my frustration, I left it where I was sitting or if the server never gave it back to me. No worries...I cancelled it. Despite the sub par service later on in the evening, I tipped $4.00 on a $20.00 bill, and shortly after signing the receipt wondered \"What the f*ck am I doing? That's 25% gratuity with bad service.\" However, I would actually go back because the food was delicious. I just have to maintain the mind set of expecting crumby service while I'm there. Two stars instead of three because three exclaims \"A-OK!\" but because of the service, it was more \"Meh.\""}
{"text":"Oysters were REALLy good. I had the garlic butter grilled one. They are a bit small, they they sure taste good. The flash fried calamari, however, was meh. I don't know if it was just my order, but the calamari was so tiny, I couldn't taste it. It was like eating batter by itself. Which is a shame because the sauces that came with the calamari was good. Had an order of the steamed clams (in some sort of sacue) and that was okay too.  Would come back for the oysters, but wouldn't order the calamari again."}
{"text":"Seafood wasn't fresh and food was extremely bland. I ordered the Cajun Scallops and there wasn't anything Cajun about it at all...I wasn't satisfied and they need to add some seasonings to their food. I will not eat here again. Yuck!!"}
{"text":"Craving oysters I was delighted to find the Oyster Bar at Harrahs. First try. They were closed st 10 pm. Hello closed early in Vegas?!   Second try, not much better. I sit st the bar and wait. No silverware or water. Eventually the chef drops off a menu. $36 s dozen.   I ask about whether they have East Coast. He rattles off a list of mixed.  Argh.   I get a half dozen of blue points which were yummy but not worth the poor treatment. Pass on this place"}
{"text":"The service,  sitting at the bar, was mediocre even though they weren't that busy. The caesar salad and the flatbread were very good. I got the Cajun scallops with risotto. The risotto was good, but the scallops were undercooked and had no seasoning at all. Very bland.  Not expensive for  the strip, but i expected more."}
{"text":"This Oyster Bar looked quite appealing as I entered, saw large shrimp boil, and sat down at a vacant seat to finish what I started over 1-1/2 hours before when I was served a too scanty meal at the Grand Cafe nearby.  I ordered a regular bowl of New England Clam Chowder, and was pleased to quickly receive some butter and two excellent complimentary rolls: one sourdough and the other multigrain.  I quickly polished off both bread products while watching more seafood being boiled and shrimp in the process of deveining.  Then a bowl of white chowder arrived and, with Saltines and Oyster Crackers, was set before me.  It was steaming hot and teeming with meaty morsels of clams.  And, it was very very good!  Besides clams, there were cooked potatoes, pieces of celery, and tasty broth that was not too creamy and not too thin.  I was only sorry when everything had been consumed.  Service was very good.  And paper menus were comprehensive and self-explanatory enough.  But they were covered with food stains, and had obviously been pawed over.  New ones would be in order.  I will definitely be back, next time for a full dinner instead of just seeking to augment an unsatisfied appetite."}
{"text":"Overall acceptable oyster bar in Vegas. If you don't want to mess with the wait at Palace Station then give this place a try. We tried the raw oysters and pan roast at level 3. The oysters were good. Although on the smaller end, the oysters tasted sweet and not too gooey. The pan roast was just ok. Although the flavor profile was good with nice hints of seafood, tomato, and garlic, the consistency was watery.   Service was somewhat attentive while we did have to flag down the server a few times. The place is small. If you happen to be at the Hard Rock, check it out."}
{"text":"Back again, this time for the Étouffée. They have great service and great flavors. I only find them lacking in the portions of the seafood in the gumbo, jambalaya and étouffée. Needs about a handful more. Also scallops are absent from the menu. I do like the place and will be a regular as I find few other seafood places as good in the same budget.."}
{"text":"I was unfamiliar with Gold Band oysters but they were the only ones available so I went ahead and ordered a dozen. I should've asked questions first. That was my mistake. But the staff seemed rushed. I was served a  mediocre Bloody Mary- no salt rim, no garnish, no flavor. Then came a sad plate of oysters. They didn't have any briny sea smell. No smell at all. They looked...off. They didn't look or smell like they were bad, just not right. Served with cocktail sauce instead of mignonette so it masks the flavor of the oysters instead of enhances it. After eating a couple I understood why. There was no flavor. It was like imitation oysters. Turns out they are cheap oysters from the Gulf that are pasteurized. They have to wrap a \"gold band\" around them to keep them closed and they last weeks. Disgusting. I put money on the bar and walked away from the pile of disappointment. Just no."}
{"text":"Great food. I enjoy coming here and trying something new every time. The employees provide great service. I'm from the east coast and it's very hard to find good seafood restaurants but this place pulls it off. My fiancé and I are locals and this is our \"to go\" spot for our date nights."}
{"text":"Eaten here many times and the food has been OK.  It seems ever since the Sunset Stations have gone into bankruptcy things have really cheapened up,but the prices have risen.  Small things keep this place from being a 3 to 3.5 star eatery.  The bread rolls are all ways stale(we're talking week old stale). They used to have pepper mills. Not any more.  The people that work there are friendly and efficient,but it seems to me like they aren't treated very well.    It looks as if they work in fear of losing their jobs.  It just feels cheap."}
{"text":"REVIEW YOUR BILL.  I had an issue with my bill which is why I gave 4 stars.   I usually do not like muscles. We ordered the cold seafood platter for an appetizer. A little pricey but what the heck...VEGAS BABY! My wife convinced me to try the muscles and after some coercing, I gave in. To my surprise, they were DELICIOUS. We also tried the seafood risotto...FANTASTIC!"}
{"text":"Let me start off by saying the staff was extremely friendly. Our waitress Farah was such a sweetheart. I was a bit disappointed by the food. The New England Clam Chowder was extremely thick and clumpy. The live Maine Lobster was small and not the best (my husband and I both agreed that the one we had at Red Lobster was better). The shrimp bowl was was also a miss; extremely spicy and little shrimp. The fettuccine Alfredo with chicken was terrible! The fettuccine was way over cooked, bland and the chicken tasted old. The bread rolls in the bread basket were stale. The only thing that I could say was actually really, really good were the crab legs (1lb for $28). Wow! The best I've had. If I'm ever craving crab legs I know where to go. I just wish they could improve the rest of their dishes and bring in new tables and chairs. For a group of four or more it can be very uncomfortable as the place is a bit tight and their tables are so narrow you're bumping knees with the person infront of you. Beware if you intend on bringing children; no kids menu and besides the fettuccine Alfredo it's all seafood (most of it being spicy). Also, no kids cups!"}
{"text":"I was shopping at caesars forum shops n saw harrahs hotel across the street..saw the sign oyster bar outside n decided to have lunch there...u jus seat yourself at bar..menu is already on counter like a placemat..open kitchen area in back of counter..was gonna order oysters but decided on the o.b.'s pan roast..it has a little of everything..lobster, shrimp, crab claws, clams, mussels all in a bowl of smoked tomato cream sauce n big scoop of jasmine rice...sold! Omgg it was so delicious! Jus the crab claws a little dry but i still ate it all lol... My server who was also the chef..raymundo..he was super cool...awesome food n service! I will be back!!"}
{"text":"I am not an oyster lover, muscles are awful as far as I am concerned. However, the oysters here are the bomb!"}
{"text":"The service is amazing. Make sure to sit at the bar !!! And if you're a total rewards member you get a discount."}
{"text":"this placed was recommended by a friend of mine after i voiced to him that i wanted seafood in vegas that didn't require all you can eat crab legs.  i wanted real deal sea food (shellfish!) and he said there was an oyster bar at harrah's casino so i decided to check it out.  i ordered the jumbo shrimp cocktail, a dozen oysters, and my girlfriend ordered the lobster bisque and some other fish dish.  i felt the food was pretty good and the service was great and attentive but the location was bad.  it was right on the casino floor and it was loud and busy so that was a big minus.  the total came out to about 60 bucks but it was worth the experience."}
{"text":"Two words. Fish & Chips. Or is that three words?  The set-up of the venue is wide open, first come first served, and it's a ton of fun. Interactive from start to finish, you get to watch all of your food being prepared and it's oh-so-delicious. Questions? Ask the chef. They are right there. You can't miss them.  My new favorite is the Fish & Chips. Thick cut fries with freshly battered fish hugs.  Highly recommend you pop in early to Hard Rock if you're going to see a show and grab some drinks and grub. Eventually I might need a season's pass for Magic Mike and this is a perfect stop for some nourishment before the show."}
{"text":"I was there.  I saw it all happen.  It was awful.  Of course Jason failed to mentioned that the location is prime as you will walk by the food court on the way out...hello Fat Burger.  I may have been even more disappoint then Jason at the meal, as my friend and I use to frequent this joint a lot.  The server did apologize profusely and explained that the main chef was on vacation and the second server was out sick.  Still when you order the oyster roast, spicy, and it comes with four measly oysters and tastes like pink cream, no amount of excuses can appease.  I probably will go back just because it's our local casino and we catch the movies there...but I won't recommend it."}
{"text":"What is this thing people keep mentioning about ? Pan Roast?  I found out at THIS oyster bar (since it was closer and I've read both mixed reviews about the one at Palace Station) that it was a HUGE bowl of tomato-butter soupy heaven with two scoops of rice and a good amount of seafood (as we ordered the combination)  My BF ordered the Jumbalaya which had a thicker texture and more flavors. We also got a half dozen of oysters, which had somewhat put my mouth on fire as we were sampling the different types of hot sauces they had on the table. The service was quick since there were only about 4 other parties.   My Fave pan roast place so far with the restaurant decor as well since they had a waterfall right next to us and it was kind of romantic :)"}
{"text":"I've been coming to this fine establishment for about 4 years now when I need some time away from the missus (lol) and i've always ordered the Oysters which are very good, especially when I pair it with a glass of wine. Their combination pan roast which I just tried recently is excellent despite its $20 price tag. The staff is friendly, the cooks are good and the ambiance is cool. The Oyster Bar in Sunset Station - check it out!"}
{"text":"Ordered calamari, highly salty and tasted frozen. My wife had chicken parmesan, tasted frozen. Then I had a shrimp linguini, had only 6 shrimp, which was drenched in butter. Then the bread came with olive oil and balsamic. That may have been the only thing that was worth eating. Not a big fan of the dishes. Maybe we ordered the wrong things but our only experience will not be bringing us back."}
{"text":"Solid 3/5. Their food may be delicious, but that doesn't erase the fact that their bar top service...horrible! The last two times I've been there, took forever for someone to take our orders and then over an hour for our food. How can an establishment have ONE cook? Such a shame. Oysters are good. Clam chowder was delicious. But then... cockroach crawling on the wall. EEEWWWWWWWW. That is all."}
{"text":"I would always stop by here if we were craving oysters but also wanted to drink. The 3 oyster shooters was the best deal because you can get these shooters with patron silver for roughly $15/$16. I have also eaten here and everything is delicious."}
{"text":"This oyster bar hidden inside Harrah's is actually quite good!  It was just hard for me to enjoy it because I absolutely HATE smoking, and the smell from the smokers in the casino emanates throughout the restaurant.  We ordered a bunch of oysters, mostly blue point. It depends on what kind of texture you like...fat oysters? Skinny oysters? Ask your server and they'll come up with something to your liking.  The oyster shooters were good! And they had sake, which was an interesting flavor.  I also recommend the clam chowder! So piping hot and tasted like it came from New England."}
{"text":"WOW!!! I have found the best Oyster Bar in Las Vegas & its tucked away in the Hard Rock Hotel of all places. As a resident of down town Las Vegas i was super saddened when Glutton closed but a friend told me that the old owner of Glutton was the guy who put the oyster bar together & like his restaurant downtown the Oyster Bar did not disappoint.  We had 1 dz of the blonde oysters (best oyster I have ever had), calamari fries and the shrimp & grits . Everything was spot on with flavors & freshness I would recommend this place in a heart beat to anyone wanting the best seafood. We will for sure be back very soon."}
{"text":"Very yummy! Sat at the bar, had cioppinno with pasta which was delicious! Great service, always excellent."}
{"text":"Fantastic, fresh oysters! I also ordered the Linguini with clams and the bananas foster for dessert and everything was excellent!"}
{"text":"I was craving for raw oysters after looking at my old pictures at Boiling Crab. There aren't many oyster bars on the strip (probably the only one on the strip) but luckily this one is legit.  Prices are reasonable: $20 for a dozen. You can find cheaper joints with raw oysters like on Spring Mountain Road if you have a car. Overall, my craving for raw oysters that night was satisfied!"}
{"text":"Oh my! Where should I start!   Location:  The Oyster Bar is located inside Harrahs.   Full service bar and oyster bar.  You can easily pull up to the bar and enjoy the atmosphere and ambiance.  There is a big TV for your enjoyment or your company should be fine.   Food, well considering I was trying to have a light lunch. I just kept ordering and ordering.  I think I can honestly say everything is good here.  Oyster connoisseurs can dive into their many different variety of prepared oysters.  If you are feeling naughty go RAW.  They have an oyster happy hour between 2-4pm.  Don't ask the price. Idk, I was just eating away!  I opted for the garlic Parmesan, (not happy hour price) The oysters were from New York and Washington.  They typically have that flavor of really cold and a distinct taste.  OB's Pan Roast, the flavor was so on point.  The tomato base,  well groomed and creamy touch drowning the seafood was the drunken love I'm talking about! Forget Beyoncé, I'm stupid drunk over here off of some seafood! I hope I leave my waistline in Vegas..Man shoot! Too good!"}
{"text":"Loved this seafood place when we stayed at Sunset Station.  So much so, that I ate here twice.  Once for dinner with three others, and the other time for lunch by myself.  I was flat-out amazed by the quality and quantity for the price (especially by Vegas standards)  Husband and I shared the Sunset Roast with Shrimp, Crab, Chicken & Andouille in a rich Cream, Brandy & Tomato Sauce served with rice.  And they bring bread for the table, which is so good dunked in the sauce.  I was very glad we shared it because it's very rich, but oh-so-good!  (note they do charge $5 to share, but it's better than wasting food, imho). Our friends should have followed our lead because they both ordered the Seafood Jambalaya and left behind massive amounts of rice.  When I went back for my solo lunch, I sat at the counter, had a glass of wine and the Shrimp Louie salad and enjoyed watching the Chef perform his magic. We had a nice chat as well. My salad had jumbo shrimp as well as bay ones, lots of good greens and a terrific dressing on the side.  At $12, it is a steal for the quality.  Seafood-lovers, if you're staying here, go early in your stay because you're gonna want to come back!"}
{"text":"Love the seafood here, fresh and tasty.  Our server Sammy was very attentive, made our 3 and 5 year old kids feel special"}
{"text":"Oysters on the half shell--a dozen for $20! The oysters are freshly shucked and you can't really go wrong with fresh oysters. My friends and I also ordered the fried calamari appetizer and it was no good. The calamari was heavily battered and mushy. I'd suggest coming here for just the oysters and drinks!"}
{"text":"What a pleasant surprise this place was!  While my wife and I stayed at The Palazzo, my brother and niece stayed at Harrah's so, I found myself there a few times.  Fortunately for me, a couple of those times were around lunch time and we wound up at the Oyster Bar.   Frankly, was not expecting much as Harrah's overall just seems a bit meh.  The Oyster Bar was far from meh though even if only rating the quality of the oysters.  They were ice cold, perfectly briny and served with some kick butt hot horseradish to add to your cocktail sauce.  Ate 4 dozen between the two lunches.  Also tried the seared tuna one of the days.  It was good, not great like the oysters though.  The only true downer was the clam chowder which was average at best.  If you're in the neighborhood and craving some oysters, hit this place and you won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"We were looking for convenience our first night but the food was also very good.  I had the parmesan crusted halibut and it was great.  The service was good we had a large group but every one was served in a timely manner so we weren't late for our other events."}
{"text":"I frequent this location, and I'm always satisfied! Delicious food, awesome service! Signature pan roast is the best."}
{"text":"We always get the Pan Roast, has just the right amount of brandy and cream, abundant amount of seafood.  Love it!  Atmosphere is great, too.  Love the waterfall!"}
{"text":"Can you ever go wrong with bacon wrapped scallops?! Such soft scallops wrapped with slightly crispy bacon... Enough said. http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/esBRj9uPRzwxaW4Lz1XGLA?select=pLRczvnXA6XtDrUDhjzxag#08IrO9UivhSGlb0dMWiMhQ"}
{"text":"Good, well seasoned quality seafood dishes at good prices. Service can be a little longer as there ate typically 1-3 people working entire restaurant. Better than Palace Station location and no ridiculous waits. Had signature pan roast and caesar with crab. Both were fresh!"}
{"text":"The clam chowder was alright, the waitstaff was super fast, though it wasn't very busy, but the oysters we got in the half shell could have been better... They weren't briny enough.  We also got one of the seafood entrees, it was mediocre as well. The closest bathroom is a trek away . Overall, it was alright. Wouldn't eat there again, but it wasn't terrible."}
