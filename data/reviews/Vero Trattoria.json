{"text":"LOVE this place, the menu is fresh with new and exciting seasonal dishes. I have been here many times and love it. Staff is superb and management is on top of everything. Highly recommended for romantic meal, or a treat for family and friends."}
{"text":"Six of us went for dinner and I didn't find any issues with service as others have found.  Our order was taken quickly and the food came quickly.  I tried the polenta antipasti and have a pizza main.  The polenta had a ton of flavour - I would not hesitate to order again.  The pizza was flat crust with artichoke and black olives.. delicious!  I found this place slightly more expensive than other Italian spots in the area but I would still definitely come back!"}
{"text":"Only fair Italian food. Service gets sloppy, particularly on Fri / Sat nights. Nice decor though."}
{"text":"I ordered the egg noodles and shrimp pasta dish. It was alright, but there was so much salt in my food I must have consumed about six glasses of water. My lips were actually puckered up by the end of the meal.  I need to make a comment about the service. I found it very strange that at one point the server mistakenly poured wine into my water glass and commented, really loudly, \"Shit. What the fuck am I doing?\" Seriously? I do not pay 20 bucks/entree to be cussed at when I'm out with older members of my family. It was actually awkward and really inappropriate. Just apologize, and go get another glass.   All in all, it's just another over priced carbohydrate/salt fest. Typical Italian place... I could have gotten it cheaper at the Olive Garden."}
{"text":"Reservation for two at 6:30 on Friday evening; were warned that the table had to be vacated by 8:00. Service was so brisk however, that even with soup as an appy, we had the bill by 7:20. Very noisy as there is little to absorb the sound. I had to ask a server not to bang my chair each time they passed (in fairness, they have v. little room to maneuver) We had two 6 oz glasses of the house wine, the soup of the day, and for mains I had the vegetarian risotto (runny.) My friend had the beef daily special, which she liked. The bill was $122.00. The tables tops are bare woodgrain arborite as in a cafeteria. There were no extras such as flowers or candles.  I've no reason to return"}
{"text":"Had a reservation, were placed in the corner seat which smelled like a bathroom, gross. Food was good, except the antipasto misto (left something to be desired compared to other italian places). Service was okay but the experience was not worth the price. No debit only cash/credit."}
{"text":"Went there by chance:  had meant to go to L'Avenue Bistro a few doors down, but it was closed for a private function.    Server was gracious and friendly, and the atmosphere was good (dimly lit, tables not too close together, lots of wood).    Food was OK, but didn't set the world on fire.  Mixed greens salad was alright.  They used stewed tomatoes instead of fresh tomatoes, which on a freezing January evening was a nice touch.   I ordered the rib-eye...I always advise people not to order a steak when at a non-steak house, and yet I didn't follow my own advice.  The cut of meat was decent enough, but you could tell it hadn't been cooked at a high enough temperature, and lacked the charred bits of fat that can make it so tasty!   My friend had bucatini with chicken, which was OK, but without any flourish or style.  I am a mediocre cook, so if I see a dish at a restaurant that I could make myself, I can't help but wonder \"why bother coming here?\"   Prices were reasonable, so I suppose that tempers expectations a bit.  It was a decent enough place, and I wouldn't say no to returning, but I wouldn't go out of my way to return."}
{"text":"We really liked the previous restaurant (Joe Fiasco's) that was in this location. Vero looked upscale from it, so we waited a while to try it. We found the food overall to be excellent, but a bit pricey compared to similar Italian restaurants in the area. The pasta and pizza dishes are priced reasonably, but the meat mains can be pricey, especially the specials (don't be shy about asking for the special's price before ordering). The venison special was excellent. Service was efficient, but not overly friendly (not necessarily a bad thing). The server was knowledgable and asked about allergies when we requested a substitute. We would go back for a special occasion."}
{"text":"I absolutely loved this place! One of my favourite parts is that they bring the most delicious fresh bread and olives when you sit down.  I could literally eat that for the rest of my days. For appetizer we split a caprese salad and grilled calamari- SO GOOD. The tomatoes in the salad were fresh and flavourful, and the buffalo mozzarella melted in your mouth. For the calamari, it was tender and juicy, not rubbery at all- good quality stuff! For main course I got the lamb- it was delicious and cooked to perfection.  Our server was a very nice gentleman, who was very friendly, professional and knew his stuff. The other servers that were milling about and filling water, etc seemed really professional too.  Overall, this was an amazing, and tasty experience. Truly a gem in the heart of Leaside Village!"}
{"text":"Vero is a lovely Italian Restaurant. My date and I enjoyed a fabulous meal with superb service. I had the signature salad followed by the scallops and tiramisu. My date had the grilled calamari, pizza and lemon tart. Everything was wonderful, what a find!. Teddy the manager was very hospitable, service was excellent! we have come to realize that this restaurant is a locals favorite. We will be back!"}
{"text":"Dinner. The service was painfully slow - one waiter for the patio was overwhelmed and inattentive. 15 minutes to get first glass of water. Another 15 to take our order. Took another half hour to get appetizers, with the waiter doing everything to avoid any eye contact or attempt to inform us why or how long the wait. Celery soup with gorgonzola just ok. Eggplant parmesean appetizer tasted good, but was overdone...what should have been melted cheese all around the sides had been baked to a hard cracker. Another long wait for mains. Mains - Veal Piccata - the veal had been tenderized with one of those pin rollers, and the texture was very unpleasant. The sauce was weak and accompanying gnocci was fried until the outside was a rock hard. My pepparadelli with mushrooms was bland and boring. The mushrooms were flabby. The service throughout was inattentive and very slow. A waste of money. Will not be going back."}
{"text":"Not amazing, not terrible. Pasta is pretty average. I often order the Gorgonzola gnocchi. It is very rich but delicious. I can never finish the whole thing because it is so rich, but it is a good meal. Other items I have ordered have been nothing special.   Nice atmosphere and friendly staff. A good place to go with a small group."}
{"text":"Ok, so I will never go into Vero ( on Bayview) again. Although the ambience is nice, well it's average anyway, the waiter is awful. And it's always the same guy! Lol  He is rude, completely disinterested in his customers, and looks overall like he could care less. He acts bored with his cusomers, comes across like he is just going through the motions, and really he has no desire to actually deliver quality customer service.  I've been in there 3 times now, and will now officially not go back. I am always friendly to wait- staff, was a waitress myself for years. This waiter barely acknowledge's you when you walk in, and subsequently throughout your entire stay there. When my friend and I wanted to pay, we placed our debit cards on the table. He blurts out in such a crass manner, 'we don't take debit here!' That was it. No niceties, no friendliness. Our bill was $100.00. So it's not like we had a cheap bill. Not that that would warrant rude service anyway.  Useless. I was there this past summer , and he acted the same way. Blase, bored, 'whatever' attitude. Had to ask for a glass of water atleast 3 times before he brought it, with no apologies, no acknowledgement of the fact that I had to keep reminding him. God, who needs it! There are SO many places to go in Toronto. I will not waste my time there ever again.  Kim"}
{"text":"Ordered the smoked salmon on hash and he got french toast with banana, strawberries and syrup. Seriously, I was so underwhelmed with the food I was happy that I got it off Groupon because there would be no way I'd pay $12-15 for those dishes. Smoked salmon was lacking the \"smokiness\", the hollandaise was dry and crusting up when it got to me, the french toast was dry and there was 3 pieces of strawberries. We also ordered lattes - they were alright but I wouldn't get it again.  We felt like the waitress didn't want to serve us - we understand you are a little busy but I'm sorry we seem to be causing such inconvenience to you. The waiter wasn't do much to help the waitress so we understand her frustration.  Overall, we did not enjoy our experience here and will not return. We're just glad we got this offer through Groupon."}
{"text":"I love a good antipasto platter and the antipasto misto delivered!  Great size to share as an appi and a good selection of fresh meats cheeses and olives etc. Had the carbonara.  Yum!  Love the atmosphere. Will def go back!"}
{"text":"Worst pizza in Toronto. Finding it empty on a Friday evening said a lot. But we still wanted to give it a try... Bad idea!"}
{"text":"This place is really good, finally good Italian restaurant on Bayview. It's in the spot where Joe Fiasco's used to be (Joe's was very good too) and this folks have taken it up a notch. Food was awesome, pasta, antipasti you name it. Service was excellent, very casual and they didn't try to speak fake Italian like many places in the area. I'm giving it 4 stars only because it was a bit pricey compared to north and south Yonge & Eglinton, or Mt. Pleasant south of Eglinton."}
{"text":"We made a reservation months in advance to have dinner here on Mothers' day. When we arrived the table they took us to was set for 9 people but was a table for 6. They squished people in at the corners which made the entire dining experience uncomfortable, as well as blocking access to the tables around us.  So not a great start....  One of the members of our party had been there before and raved about the place, so I will admit that my expectations were pretty high...which might account for my severe disappointment with this particular dining experience.  The only positive I can give is that our wait staff were very friendly and highly attentive. We had 3 people serving us (which may have only been due to the special occasion, cant imagine that kind of service on a regular day?).  Onto the food....   My husband had the Caesar Salad... hard to mess that up but the dressing they used was so overpowering (I love garlic but this was insane) and the lettuce was wilted due to the amount of dressing. Think they had pre-dressed a large bowl and left it out on the counter for hours... thats how it tasted.  A member at our table clearly ID'd herself as gluten-free and asked if her salad could be served without croutons. They said \"of course!\", but that slice of garlic bread tossed on top of her salad isnt gluten free either....   I shared the antipasta platter with another party member. At $19 we expected a decent amount of food + bread to be provided (and it states in the menu its meant to be shared).  Some items we only received one of (so cant share), the other items were got 2 pieces.... very miniscule portions for the price.  I have received more food at half the price from other Italian restaurants in the city.  That being said - the quality of what was on the platter was quite tasty - so points for that.  I decided to try their special of the day for my main - a veal chop with seasonal vegitables.  The piece of meat looked amazing .... but was so bland and tasteless (and undercooked) I couldnt eat it.  It was served ontop of one carrot and one fingerling potatoe (cut into halves so it looks like two pieces of vegitable) and a piece of something leafy, green and cooked .  All of that was on top of a very tangy roasted red pepper drizzle, which wasnt to my taste. For $30+ this was a disappointment.  Our GF friend was terrified to eat her meal as they played a game of musical dishes at the table, having forgotten which pasta was the GF one and which were the regular....   One friend ordered the pizza thinking to play it safe. Her meal arrived 15 minutes after everyone elses and the dough was still raw and gooey. She isnt one to complain so we sent it back for her..... we were told the first pizza was overcooked so they made her a new one.  When they brought the second pizza back (the one we sent back) the waiter complained to us that this looked just like the first one, and that he should have just served her that one - YES he should have.    The bill came to over $400 for the 8 of us - which normally we would be ok with - but with that price tag comes some high expectations. Vero didnt deliver for us and we wont be back."}
{"text":"Food quite good, service a bit slow, prices compare with similar restaurants in the area... Pepperoni pizza of good size and taste, tiramisu tasted good, but very small portion..(? Summerlicious)....bread not served warm....zuppa of the day...no great shakes...fresh orange juice seemed diluted with water and not served cold enough...pleasant staff, unpleasant carpeting on stairs leading to washrooms. (Very dirty looking, or old....needs to be thrown"}
{"text":"Food is terrible. I got a Caesar salad and it was so fishy. Way too much anchovy. Plus it was room temperature. I saw one of the busboys mix the salad with his hands. The carbonara was extremely dry and I found some pieces of pasta that weren't even cooked. My friend got the salmon and it was definitely not fresh. Super mushy and fishy smelling.   The kitchen is not hygienic. The tabletops are filthy and the chef was using the oven to store dirty pans.  Do not recommend this place. It's also ridiculously priced for what it is"}
{"text":"Worse Italian place in town. Had jumbo shrimp and scallops capellini. It was tasteless and only had ONE jumbo shrimp with some smaller shrimps.which is false advertising. The scallops were tiny too!! Wild mushrooms Risotto was dry, and lack of mushrooms. It's called wild mushroom, but they only put one kind of white mushrooms. pizza was average too! Will not go back for sure."}
