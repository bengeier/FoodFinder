{"text":"We came here for the first time recently and the food was great and portions huge. Had Singapore noodles and sizzling beef with mushrooms. Only Asians in the restaurant with us, which is always a good sign. Already looking forward to coming back!"}
{"text":"I've been to this place 3 times. In general, food is great but sometimes the taste is not stable enough. I ordered oven baked rice with fish filet - portugese style (????????), hK style cold milk tea(???), country style stir fry vermicelli (????), etc. Compared to the traditional milk tea from Hong Kong, this drink tasted a bit weird.   

Portion sizes are big. Many more dishes that I would like to try. Will return if I have a chance."}
{"text":"Finally a clean and modern Cantonese canteen style restaurant. Just opened and it's already packed with people. A good sign for a restaurant away from the usual popular Asian foodie strip in Brossard. If you're in the area, you gotta try this."}
{"text":"The beef soup noodles very good but way to small portions. The Dim Sum is average. Just for 2 soup noodles and 6 dim sum plates was already 42$ without tax. Just kinda overprice for their items."}
{"text":"Were here for lunch, enjoyed our meal, but they need to work on the service, we were seated promptly then brought tea but didn't get any menus until we asked for them, without explanation, we were then given three different menus and a piece of paper and pencil,we wrote down our order on the paper and handed it over to the waitress who was visibly unimpressed that we had written on the paper she then erased what we had written and proceeded to try and read it! She then snapped rudely at us, \"just wait a minute!\" When we tried to help her out. After the ordering fiasco, we were brought soup and the waiter walked away, no bowls or spoons until we called him back to get us some"}
