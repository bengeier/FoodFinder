{"text":"Can I make this negative stars? Yelp said it was open, but it's permanently closed. DO NOT GO!"}
{"text":"Very solid restaurant. My friends love to smoke hookah. The service is personal and friendly. It is a good stop for csu kids. The campus dining are limited and overall comically bad. Nice vibe. This place rocks"}
{"text":"5 stars for really good burgers and very cheap prices. The staff is \"confusingly\" friendly, probably miss communication as English not being their first language."}
{"text":"Really good! Not overly fancy or anything but if you want tasty food and a relatively strong hookah this place is great.
Gyro and hummus was tasty, didn't try anything else but those were good
Apple mint hookah is the best hookah and the owner nailed it
Worth a try if you don't mind informal seating and decor
Park in the back, it's easier"}
{"text":"They have the best Apple Mint hookah here. It's a nice spot off in the cut. The service is good and I've never had a bad experience. I do wish they stayed open late on weekends like other hookah spots."}
{"text":"The food is good , I have ordered falafel wrap & lentil soup . The falafel wrap was freshly made & very delicious , also the lentil soup was home made style . The hookah is not excellent since that are mixing the hookah for different kind of tobacco . I suggest employing a professional hookah man . The atmosphere is very relaxing with Arabic music . Permanent closed"}
{"text":"The \"Quadrangle\" or whatever this neighborhood is called (I thought it was midtown?) really lacks in dining options, especially for students that still have tastebuds from all the awful campus dining CSU has to offer. Pasha Cafe is an alternative to the 3 Subways, 2 Starbucks and the countless sandwich shops in the area. 

Pasha Cafe offers reasonably priced Mediterranean food, such as falafel, shwarma, gyros, grape leaves, along with hookah every night. The falafel is moist, even though not made fresh, but the wrap tastes good for what you pay for. Sometimes one of the workers will ask you to pick from one of the pickled vegetables (turnips or carrots? I don't know about you guys, but I always thought you get all of them); other times not so. What motivates me to write about this place isn't the food, even though that's decent, or the hookah, which I am too much of a germophobe to try, but instead the personal, I mean REALLY PERSONAL customer service here.

One day, while on lunch break, I came in to order just a basic falafel wrap and a soda. The owner with the glasses and receding hairline made my sandwich, accompanying it with compliments directed towards me. I smiled and nodded. I just wanted to get this uncomfortable encounter over with so I can dive into my food. Well, as I was paying, he leaned in. I thought \"oh okay he's leaning in to shake my hand. Maybe he's thanking me for coming in here.\" Then he got closer. ~cue Jaws music~ Alright maybe he is going to whisper something into my ear? Nope. This complete stranger kisses me on the cheek without any warning. Yeah it's a nice gesture, but when you're a 20 something year old getting a cheek kiss from a 50 something year old, I can't help but think something is a bit off. 

BUT, if I was at any other restaurant, I would simply refuse to ever eat there again. Not at Pasha. Pasha Cafe does their Mediterranean food just well enough, that the ratio between creepiness factor and yumminess of food is about 1:3."}
{"text":"Great food and great people try the chicken shawarma and taboulah salad also there deserts are delicious"}
{"text":"As someone who grew up with Greek and Turkish food I can not give a good rating to Pasha Caf√©.  Here were my issues:
1. I waited more than 15 minutes for to-go order: Strike 1
2. After waiting that long I would have expected hot, fresh Falafel and fries.  Both were cold.  Also, there is no way the falafel was fresh (I know fresh falafel): Strike 2
3. I watched them \"heat\" the pita in a microwave.  This is an immediate \"Off my list\" moment, especially when there is a Panini grill next to the microwave!: Strike 3
4. They do not have Feta cheese.:  You're OUT!

Maybe they have good hookah's?  But I'll never know as I won't waste my time, or money, here again."}
{"text":"Good food and charming service!!!  We always get the falafel roll and it's always perfect fresh and filling!"}
{"text":"The food was okay, nothing special. But the older guy at the counter needs to chill, you won't get customers back with an attitude."}
{"text":"Casual dining setting with a separate large room for Hookah fans. The falafel sandwich here was tasty and will visit again."}
{"text":"Nothing bad to say. I go at least 2-3 times a week for a wrap or burger of some sort, and it has never been sub par. The quality of the food remains consistent."}
