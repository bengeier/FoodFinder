{"text":"Good place, tasty burgers, decent service. I'll go again. Location is clean and keeps up the Hero's burgers good reputation."}
{"text":"I've always liked the burgers here but don't come often. I've had to sit through a smoke filled dining area twice in the last 6 months. Obviously there's a problem with the ventilation here, but it looks like they're either not fixing it properly or there are bigger construction issues. Either way, ruins the burger when you can smell all the burnt oil/grease. Takeout is probably a better idea."}
{"text":"After enjoying a 6 oz burger on a multi-grain flatbread....I threw it all up 8 hours later. Thanks, hero burger, for giving me food poisoning and keeping me up all night.  Not worth the 7 dollars."}
{"text":"This is the Best burger I have ever had, it was made super fast, super juicy and the beef was very tender. The lady at the cash register was very courteous and friendly, she even handed back my receipt with double hand, a gesture of gratitude and friendliness. The restaurant and bathroom were clean. This restaurant is highly recommended."}
{"text":"YUMM!!!!!  love the burgers!   I really like that you can customize and the food is worth the price."}
{"text":"The Hero Burger is a pretty decent place to grab a solid burger. In general, Hero Burgers are a pricier-higher quality compared with your run of the mill Harveys. They offer more options for toppings and have great tasting meats.   The poutine here is average (at best!!) ...they're trying this weird dressing thing on their poutines ...not worth it. I tried the one with the bacon and it was like eating salad dressing: an interesting attempt, but disgusting. They kindly have a vegetarian option for gravy, but it really doesn't taste as good as other vegetarian gravy I've had in the past. Poutine = no no. The burger is honestly so customizable that I'm 100% sure you'll find something you like.   The setup here is rather narrow. You walk in and order your burger and in the meantime you can play with their AWESOME (!!!) drinks selection menu. I swear each time I order a drink I think I'm in Star Trek.   TL;DR: decent burger place, close to the theaters. You'll pay more, but you have many options to make it worth it. Avoid poutine here."}
{"text":"What a surprise this place was when I came in for lunch today!  I was convinced that Canada did not have any good hamburger places until I went here.  I mean, Harvey's is a horrible, horrible atrocity  when it comes to burgers.  It upsets me so much that they are the reason that Carl's Jr./Hardee's is prevented from entering Canada.  I guess the only way to succeed for a burger chain in Canada is to make sure superior burgers do not make it to Canada.  Wait until they get a taste of In-N-Out hamburgers...  Hero is very similar to Five Guy's Burgers, except the meat is probably a bit tastier.  You get your selection of toppings and sauces.  I ordered the 8 ounce Hero burger with a whole lot of toppings.  That was one nice chunk of beef.  The onion rings were sweet, crispy, and delicious.  The staff is friendly.  If I need a quick fixin' for a burger, I have finally found my place in Toronto."}
{"text":"This review came after some great internal debate. i hymped and I hawed back and forth as to whether or not I award this place 2 or 3 stars after my recent visit here. I refuse to give a half star as 1/2 points are about as satisfying as kissing ones own cousin and seeing as I don't do one I refrain from doing the other... ok off topic there for a moment (this is what happens when you write a review at 12:30AM)  I really cannot say anything bad about Hero Certified Burgers. The burgers and toppings are always, ALWAYS, tasty and delicious. Cooked to near perfection and the ability to make unique combinations is always a fav of mine.   This being said, I must warm you all about the terror which is their specialty sandwich menu. The taste remains consistently good but more than 1-2 of these a week and you will for sure be headed to the poor house. THEY BEEZ EXPINSIVE!!!  A recent late lunch stop here had me feening for a gourmet grilled chicken sandwich - enter the Italian Deluxe Chicken Sandwich (should have taken a hint that anything DELUXE will break ones bank).  Topped with goat cheese, grilled peppers and mushrooms, cheese and special sauces all served on a toasted Chiabatta bun, I cannot tell a lie - it was amazing! BUT at $13 for only the sandwich I feel like HCB is going to struggle to make that sale 9/10 times.   No fries and no drink with that order (they would have cost me extra). Not great value.  My only other complaint here was the cleanliness of the establishment. Bathrooms and tables were neglected during the post lunch rush. I'll give them the benefit of the doubt here BUT I will be back HERO BURGER..... and I'll be watching (slanty evil eyes)."}
{"text":"Came here for a quick bite to eat before a movie and usually love Hero burgers but was throughly disappointed in the service. My husband and I decided to order their speciality items other than their burgers, what a wrong choice. I ordered the cranberry turkey burger and my husband ordered their speciality chicken burger. I decided to try their black bamboo bun which you need to pay extra for and the cashier raved it was so different and tasted so good from their normal sesame bun. When we got our meals, I discovered the cashier had inputted my meal wrong and had give me a regular turkey burger with no toppings and just the black bamboo bun. Not really wanting to wait or pay extra, I took some toppings from my husband's burger and chowed it down. Definitely not worth the price. Next time, just stick with their regular signature beef burgers here and don't go with their other speciality options, you will be disappointed. One thing though I did appreciate is at least I saved on less added calories with having the plain burger option (but not my choice!)"}
{"text":"Im really glad this location is close to my work place I really enjoy hero burgers. The service is wonderful and during lunchtime it's not too busy. As a creature of habit I usually stick to the basic hero burger with the hero sauce and basic toppings but I'm never disappointed. You can't really go wrong with any burger you order here. Also the fries at hero burger are always delicious. Highly reckoned to any and all in the area."}
{"text":"one of the worst burgers i ever had, they state its not frozen but the shape and the horrid taste lets me believe otherwise, Fries soggy and greasy..too much choice on toppings should really focus on the meat and simplicity. would never go again, awful"}
{"text":"Let me start by saying that I love that this place is open until 2 on weekends....GREAT alternative to McDonalds for late night munchies  After frequenting Hero burger for years I finally found a topping combination that actually makes it worth returning for a reason other than sheer convenience  I get a 6 oz cheeseburger with hero sauce, ketchup, mustard, jalapeno and fire roasted peppers  After eating burgers from Hero for years this is the only burger I have actually liked  Gets a 4 for being open late on weekends and proximity to my house.....no more Mickey D's!"}
{"text":"There are always other places that sells burgers that could be better than this one.. But i still give him 5 stars on their burgers"}
{"text":"Had a craving for burgers and fries when we spotted this place.  I've never been there before but had high hopes.   First off,  customer service was excellent.  The place wasn't very busy on a Saturday afternoon, the server was more then helpful and polite with us first timers.  We ordered the 4oz beef burger with a poutine and drink.   The toppings were fresh,  the bun was fresh,  the fries were hot,  the gravy was good,  they used REAL  cheese  curds and the drink machine was amazing ( digital coke machine with tons of drink variations to choose from! ) My one criticism was the burger patty.  The texture was pretty rubbery, kinda spoungy....  Like pre-formed frozen processed patties.  They boast 100% Canadian Angus beef,  but the taste and texture is similar to a box of cheap frozen patties you can get at No Frills,  in my opinion.   If this place handmade their patties and charbroiled them, it would be a favorite spot to eat.   If you aren't a meat snob like me, this place will not disappoint!"}
{"text":"I was stranded for a few hours up in da 'bridge and was desperate for a quick bite to eat so I hit up the Hero Certified Burgers located in the mega shopping corner at Hwy. 7 & 400. I probably should have crossed the road and gone to Mucho Burritto but it came down to what I thought would be the lesser of disappointments. So I finally settled on HCB.   I ordered the standard Hero Burger with Cheese and made it a combo. If I ate this burger with my eyes closed in an undisclosed location I would have sworn I was eating a burger from Harvey's. This nondescript burger combo set me back twelve bucks. A total disappointment. The Hero sauce they put on the hamburger is that hideous Ranch styled dressing and it just ooooooozed out of the burger as I began eating it. All I could taste was toppings, I couldn't taste the meat at all. The fries were meh. Thoroughly cooked but greasy and somewhat tasteless. Ordered a side of gravy and got that instant mix gravy that most restaurants like to torture us with.   Can someone tell me why the colour of their hamburger patties looks slightly orange? This has me kind of worried. I kept checking myself in the dark to see if I am at all beginning to glow.   The only upside was that when I asked for just some water with my combo (I don't drink soft drinks) the gal behind the counter offered me a choice of Perrier. Usually they'll charge you extra for that.   HCB's. Forgetable."}
{"text":"I see these Hero burger places all over the GTA and finally decided to try one. Meh. Nothing really wrong but you can get a better burger elsewhere."}
{"text":"The girl at the cash was very nice; even asking us how our afternoon has been. She kept track of our large order perfectly as well.  The order came quickly and the food was well cooked and great. Absolutely no complaints here."}
{"text":"Not my favorite burger joint...there are better ones out there. This location has the unique advantage of being in the same parking lot as a larger multiplex theatre, hence its popularity. Do not, I repeat Do not, attempt to go into this restaurant 1/2 hr. before a popular movie starts...it does get quite busy and backed up.  The burgers themselves are not stellar...the ones at Southstreet, Five Guys, etc are tastier. They are better than McDonalds/Burger King, etc, but the price point reflects that difference. I don't mind paying extra for a gourmet burger, but not for one of this quality.  Since my last visit I haven't returned. It was far too busy, far too expensive, far too \"unkept\" for my liking."}
{"text":"My all time favourite burger place. I like this place better than Burger Priest! However, THIS IS THE ONLY LOCATION I LIKE. Ive tried Hero burger at the richmond hill location and it was not good. The colossus location is the best. Ive returned here so many times!"}
{"text":"Great tasting food served in a clean environment.   My friend ordered a Mushroom Poutine. It took at least 5 minutes after ordering for it to be finished. In the meantime, I was greeted by vandalised tic-tac-toe on one of their tables. At least the table was wiped clean! They called out our number on the speakerphone so we would go pick it up. Friend shared her Mushroom Poutine (which comes with a fountain drink) with me, and it tasted a-mah-zing. The mushroom cuts were bigger than I expected, but still good. The cheese curds were top notch, and the fries were well done. Fountain drinks are bottomless.   Washrooms are tucked away at the back of the restaurant."}
{"text":"Let's start this off by saying you can get better quality burgers in and around this area, if you're looking to be wowed Hero burger ain't the place to go. That being said, for a chain, this place is pretty decent.   I've been here a handful of times and haven't had a problem. A 6oz burger, drink and sweet potato fries comes out to around $12. I think the prices are fair but it does get a little costly if you start adding upgrades (cheese, bacon, etc).  They have one of those Coca Cola freestyle machines which is AWESOME! So many cool drink options I've never seen before... Raspberry coke? Where did this ever exist?  A high school must be near by because at lunch this place gets packed with teenagers gossiping in their uniforms. When this rush comes in the line can be long leading to late food and a over time lunch break.."}
{"text":"I love this location, very friendly staff! Yummy burgers and delicious french fries!!  Cleanish restaurant and usually clean washroom that anyone can run in and use!"}
