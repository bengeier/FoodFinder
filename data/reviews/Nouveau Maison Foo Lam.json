{"text":"This place is okay for dim sum. We came at 7:00pm for dinner. The reservation was made long time ago, but they still made us wait for long time. The food is good, but the service is aweful. The servant was extremely disrespectful to us. The food came after one hour of wait, and they say that it is the NORMAL wait time. In the end, all they cared was if you can finish eat fast and pay the bill. They impose the 15% tips to the bill, which was handwritten, and the tax was added. No official receit was given to us. We paid cash, so I highly doubt the restaurant will really pay the tax to the governement, and it was more like a 30% tips for such aweful services that we got. I am a native chinese, and had been to a great number of similar restaurants in my life.... this is definitely the worst place ever."}
{"text":"I've always considered restaurant Foo Lam comparable to Chinatown, it's a bit out of the way, but at least you don't have to compete for parking. They have a pretty eclectic menu - as it has Thai and Vietnamese items on the menu. Not to cause any confusion, they have different chefs in the kitchen that specialize in the different cuisines. With live seafood tanks in the dining room as well as a bunch of tis showing different news stations in various Asian languages, the atmosphere is a bit unique. Restaurant Maison Foo Lam shares the same entrance as Sharky's Pool Bar, so fret, just follow your nose."}
{"text":"I thought I treat my family with a good chinese diner, but we were served rotten meat, I was so embarrassed. It smelled so bad that I returned it to the kitchen. The remaining dishes are under average and not fresh.  The price of the returned dish still showed up on the bill."}
{"text":"Someone I know asked us to meet here for brunch, which I thought was weird because I usually think pancakes and eggs for brunch, not chicken feet and fried squid, but whatever. I love Chinese food so I didn't really care.   The place is right next to Shish Taouk on L'Acadie (amazing place btw) and right next to Sharky's pool hall (not amazing at all). It looked like a run-down, decrepit banquet hall for Chinese welfare recipients, but when we got there, all the tables that were occupied had Chinese patrons. Not a white person in sight. We took that as a good sign and sat down. A trolley loaded with tons of little dim sum/eggplant/rice/etc/ baskets comes around every few minutes so you can just take whatever and stuff your fat face like a Roman emperor. They tick off everything you ate on a scoresheet in the middle of your table.  By noon the place is in full beast mode - lineups of Chinese families and couples are forming at the entrance and the staff are zipping around like crazy to keep the masses eating.  Still no white people. The food was hit or miss - the dim sum was pretty good, the fried calamari was amazing, the spicy buns were awesome, the fried noodles tasted like crappy oily cardboard, and so on. It didn't matter though, because all the dishes are cheap and small, so if something sucks you just toss it aside and get something else.   When you get close to finishing, the staff start getting antsy and really push you to finish up and leave. They were exchanging the tablecloth/cover and forks/knives on our table before we had a chance to get up and stretch, which was irritating as hell. Also, no one in there speaks English or French, so if you don't know what you're ordering they won't tell you what it is.  Overall average. I think the usual spots in Chinatown are way better."}
{"text":"The food was great!  Mostly Asian customers which is a good sign.  Highly recommend the spring rolls.  The entrance was dirty and we were almost afraid to go upstairs but we're glad we did!"}
{"text":"This chinese restaurant is not the best in town. However, there's a parking lot, so it's a mega plus for me since I hate having to find parking on the streets. The restaurant is spacious and looks like any typical chinese restaurants. I've been there many times, the food are ok. Not the best, but not the worse that I've eaten.  Been there for dim sum and dinner. I'd say that I'd suggest dinner at this restaurant more than dim sum...  Prices are competitive, or even a bit cheaper than other chinese restaurants!"}
{"text":"As someone who often goes to asian restaurant, Foo Lam was definitively not the worst restaurant I have been. i tried their 2-course Peking Duck and it was still tasty (even though it was a long time since I've ever had some). Price was decent for the amount of food. Parking spots available."}
{"text":"I came to this place for years. Never let me down. Their food already good and tasty.   Dim Sum offer lot of choice around 11AM.  If you go there at opening time. You won't have lot of choice.   Lunch and Dinner  are very good too. They close around 3AM. So after the bar. We can still eat."}
{"text":"I got all excited as its called New House of Foo lam. but after my dim sum it did not make a difference. I really wanted dumplings but down town was to far to we went for something near by. The first dish we ordered was not bad looks like a steamed spring roll. But from there it was down hill. Shrimp dumplings were just OK, stuffed eggplant was tasteless to the point where I did not know what I was eating. I saw the Sui Mai and I refused it....no thank. God I miss Guangzhou. Then I asked for my fave Xiao long bap. OMG talk about gross....WTF was that. Everything else sucked....This will be the last time I have Dim sum in Montreal unless its in chinatown and even there its just OK. China or Toronto only."}
{"text":"Came here not because I wanted but because my parents that were visiting from Florida wanted to give it a try. Once again it was terrible! The food is even worse then last time!! Cold, super greasy and tasteless! And don't even get me started on the service. At one point, my uncle got quite annoyed, not to say angry, because he kept on trying to get a waiter's attention and they all pretended to not see him waiving at them like a mad man! If I could give this place a fat ZERO, I would. By all means go hungry instead of eating at this place (I don't even want to call this a restaurant)."}
