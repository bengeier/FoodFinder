{"text":"Tried their pasta. It was so hard and undercooked. The second time i tried their steak and it was pretty good. Basically a hit or miss place."}
{"text":"My colleague and I were new to the area, visiting on business and thought we'd research what was close on Yelp.  Glad we found this gem of a place.  We were thrilled with the menu, waitstaff, comfortable table and lovely ambiance.  

I had the pomegranate fizz drink and the pomegranate salad as a starter ... both excellent.  For dinner we split the mac'n cheese with bacon and the shortribs.  Again flavors were amazing.  Nothing too salty, the mac'n cheese was simply divine and the short ribs had a wonderful polenta featured with it.  Overall great dinner!"}
{"text":"My gf and I decided to visit The Wilcox after seeing it's 4 star rating on Yelp and good photos of the dishes, which put it above most other options in the restaurant wasteland in/near Downtown Sauga.  

We were both overall impressed with the decor and styling, although the few random \"antique\" pieces around the walls seemed to have no particular curation to them and seemed to be an afterthought. 

After a somewhat awkwardly phrased exchange with the hostess/front desk (about needing to vacate our table in less than 2 hours) we were seated and were impressed with the specialty drink list, and extensive menu choices. 

We shared the plain starter Nachos, Shepherd's Pie & Chicken Fettuchini, and unfortunately they went 0/3 on all three. 

Nachos... delayed because of a kitchen snafu (no problem, stuff happens) but the replacement set was likely rushed, and wasn't entirely heated before hitting our table (centre cheese layer unmelted with individual shreds) and were covered in an odd tasting tomato sauce (pizza style) which was a strange flavor combination, with nothing special about this dish. 

Entree's were also brought while only finished 2/3 of the nachos, speaking to kitchen course-timing issues. 

Shepherds pie...mashed potato top was soggy (not crispy), meat filling was soaked/watery and the kitchen likely uses frozen mixed vegetables; carrot, peas, corn? (strange in this dish ) which over-saturates the bottom layer and completely spoils the dish. For $18, one would at least expect fresh vegetables and better preparation, quite disappointing for a Gastropub. 


Chicken Fettuchini...first plate, flavour was good but pasta was undercooked (more than just El Dente), we sent this back and the replacement was cooked better, but tasted completely different, over peppered and tasted as though the kitchen may have used different wine in the the preparation (though we aren't sure) but were overall disappointed with the second plate. 


Server, was very attentive and the best part of experience here and offered a complementary salad while the pasta was re-cooked and was on-top of beverage refills without any requests. 

Overall...disappointing although we were compensated the pasta dish off the bill without prompting, which was a welcome attempt to rectify our experience, but we would likely only return here for drinks in the future, if at all."}
{"text":"I went here with friends back last August. We went there because they had buck a shuck for oysters. The oysters were delicious. They had ones from P. E. I and also ones from B.C. This is certainly a really nice place as the environment was certainly very friendly and relaxing. When I ordered a Caesar they had a special type by using Scotch instead of vodka. I tried it and it was pretty good. Although I told the server it was unique he told me I could change it. I didn't change it, loved the uniqueness and it wasn't anything bad about it. Awesome service I'd probably rate it a 4/5."}
{"text":"Extremely salty fried chicken that's overpriced.
Packaged nicely and timely delivery. That's about it."}
{"text":"So I decided to give th is place a shot and see how it stacks up.  Well, I'm not usually surprised but it was really nice to find an alternative to the usual chain establishments in the suburbs. Toronto style but not the commute. The bartenders are top notch and they cater to the most picky tastes. Try The Manhattan..ask for Christian he will take care of you. As for the food, it a good mix of fusion and traditional. Try the oysters and the civiche. It's a new spot that Mississauga really needs and it looks like it's off to a great start."}
{"text":"Probably the worst service I have ever had. Very slow to get starters, and to get main courses. Veggie with chicken pasta EXTREMELY bitter. 
Brings birthday cake without candles and asks us to bring our own cake and candles next time, because they only carried one candle for the entire establishment. 
Excuses excuses excuses and arguing with customers, didn't even apologize and our server Ceara questioned us \"have you ever worked at restaurants??\".. Insinuating we don't know about customer service. This isn't the first restaurant we went to, and customer service was way better than this at every single other place."}
{"text":"Went to this place after reading reviews on yelp. The ratings were well deserved. Tried the pulpo and fish tacos at the recommendation of others and it did not disappoint. It was FANTASTIC!  We then had a bison burger and the steak frites. Both were very good but did not outshine the appetizers. FYI the Ambience and music were also great. I recommend sitting in the bar area, it was very comfy. Everything was great, anytime I have to go to Mississauga this will now always be part of the itinerary."}
{"text":"Great ambience, they play 90's hiphop. 
Andrea is amazing. Very kind and made killer manhattans. 

So much better than the shitty scruffy's they had here ages ago. 

Definitely a great spot. Even better if you're on a date."}
{"text":"I've had the steak and frites, mac and cheese, and the Monday night taco special. All very delicious. Edit: the Wilcox Burger is also really good!
Service was great as well! 
Definitely will be back."}
{"text":"Really hip atmosphere. The vietnamese wings and bone marrow are my favourite."}
{"text":"Worst service ever ...very slow .
Food is very good though . Prices are bit high .
Got burger, the fries were so bad , but burger was nice .
Carrot cake is extremely nice if they are serving it .
Advice :don't skip desert there ."}
{"text":"Visiting from the US and travel a lot and eat at good places so set the bar high. Food is so so..ambiance is nice with glass pane roof and a great happy hour. $5 top shelf whiskey...are you kidding me...I'm in!! Server Anita was very nice."}
{"text":"Lively atmosphere - busy on a school night - good music
Good tv setup
Great decor - unique classy nature feel
Good service
Drink prices fair
Cocktail list seems extensive and maybe inventive but slightly overpriced and didn't inspire me
I ordered the scotch egg. Its well made/presented, pork is properly seasoned. BUT - it was undercooked, the innermost pork was raw and the white of the egg was not fully cooked. For me the egg was almost perfect (runny yolk) but the undercooked pork is just unacceptable - a 20-30sec mistake. 
BUT - the customer service that followed that fail was more than appropriate. I was not charged for the unfinished appetizer and one of my drinks was taken off the bill.  This is what businesses who want repeated visits and good reviews should do. Its the difference between a 1 or 2 star review and a 4 star review. 
I will be back to try other items."}
{"text":"Disappointing! 

After reading all the great reviews, I came here for dinner on a Saturday night with my girlfriend. Things started well enough with a generous sized Caesar salad. For entrees, we had the steak frites and lobster poutine. Although the fries were nice, the steak was nothing special. What really killed me was the poutine. Where was the lobster? I found a few bits, and I mean bits. I did not expect lobster tail, bt there wasn't even claw meat. So I complained to our server, and his response was \"Oh, that is what poutine is like\". Are you kidding me! Maybe this place is OK for just a drink, but I will never go here to eat again!"}
{"text":"Service was the worst I've ever had - no other way to put it. Starters came an hour after ordering. Water spilled everywhere by the waitress (Ceara) and beer spilled on a guest by the waitress (Ceara). Did not expect this level of service from what seems like a popular place...will not visit again.

Condescending and confrontation tone from waitress and the lack of management stepping in to alleviate our groups concerns is a real turnoff. Yelpers please be careful when coming here (and please also read the other reviews where the slow service and confrontational staff seems to permeate - looking back we should have seen something like this coming)."}
{"text":"Food was very good! Had the fried chicken burger and it was enormous and delicious. Dad had the lamb and bone marrow pie and really enjoyed it and the churros were some of the best i've ever had! Interior was nice as well, lots of natural light, and our waitress was friendly and professional. Would definitley come back."}
{"text":"The Wilcox is a slice of downtown in the heart of Mississauga. The cocktails are excellent especially their old fashioned which if you like they will smoke for you. If you're in the mood for oysters Tuesday and Wednesday are the nights to go because they offer buck a shuck. Everything I've tried has been fantastic but the standout has to me the steak which was cooked to perfection."}
{"text":"Went there for the oysters. Good place for friends. Prices are reasonable. No pressure from staff to order if you just want oysters."}
{"text":"Second visit here, this time at lunch with coworkers. The server suggested the shepherds pie and two of us took her advice. Delicious, homemade, generous portion and well-seasoned. Really satisfying. 

My other two coworkers had the chicken pot pie and Wilcox burger, both of which I've tried and reviewed. They were equally impressed.

Friendly, personable and attentive server. Great lunch!"}
{"text":"Pretty cool place!  

Went with a few friends before heading out to watch fights at the Hershey Center.
Happy Hour was going which resulted in a $4 cognac for me and $4 beers for the others.

The bone marrow app was solid and the nachos also good.  Neither were the best ever, but both really hit the spot.

We all had different burgers for mains and everyone was happy.  I love \"gourmet burgers\" and there's were credible.  The venue itself is also well designed and is pretty cool.  I would go back here with a date for sure.

One minor irritation is that they say they ground the meat in-house, yet they do not allow to have it cooked to order (ie-cannot choose to have it rare, med-rare etc).  In some ways this defeats the whole point of grinding the meat in-house and I think there is something up with that as it didn't quite add up to me.  

Nevertheless, a really good place and a very satisfying meal!"}
{"text":"Neat lil hip place to chill and stuff up on some fantastically oily food. The lobster poutine was the best - flavourful, moist and crispy at the same time. On the other hand, their meat pie with bone marrow was disappointing. It was oily & flavourless despite the meat's great texture. Could improve with some sauce in the pie, and cut down on the oil to help improve the pastry texture."}
{"text":"I came here for my birthday when it was quite empty. I took use forever to get our food. But the food quality was very high! Their fries are the best! I got the Fried Chicken Sandwich, it was pretty flavourful, but I have had better chicken sandwiches. Tried my friend's mac and cheese and it was great! Super cheese! Not one of my go to place, but may go back sometime in the future"}
{"text":"Cuban sandwich and house-made minestrone was exceptional.  Beer selection is not exhaustingly long but rather well thought out.  
Bravo."}
{"text":"I'd once visited this venue when it was still known as Scruffy's. At first glance on the inside, it's dramatically different from what it used to be. (Either that or I don't remember what the interior used to look like.) In any case, it's dramatically different inside, and that's a plus.

Lots of interesting choices on the menu! Our group went with the Bang Bang shrimp (on special during happy hour) and duck sliders for apps. It was a 50/50 split as the shrimp was pretty awesome. Will definitely order again! The duck sliders were alright, but there was a pretty high bun to filling ratio. And the coleslaw (which we later learned was celery coleslaw) seemed to dull the flavour of the dish. It just didn't seem \"duck-ish\" enough. (That's a word, right?) Looking forward to trying other apps on future visits.

For entrees, my fellow diners went with the fish tacos and BBQ burger, respectively. I decided on the lobster poutine. I didn't try the burger but the fish tacos were pretty good! My poutine came with a bearnaise sauce, and it was just too rich for me. (That probably just comes down to personal taste.) I definitely needed help finishing that off. Really good, but in small doses IMO.

Location is quite good, pretty much central Mississauga. Nice selection of beer, wine and cocktails. Will be back again sometime to try out some other things on the menu. Nice addition to the food/drink options in town!"}
{"text":"Good food. Nice atmosphere. I've been here a couple of times. Tried their nachos, tacos and pomegranate salad. All very delicious."}
{"text":"If you are looking for a cool lounge bar to meet up or nice patio this is a nice place. Food is mediocre. Service hit or miss usually mediocre. Love the decor and location just wish they had better food."}
{"text":"This place has a nice ambiance and friendly service. This place used to be a house, then an irish pub now a Canadian style fare resto. They've kept the house type feel for their interior which works very well. Its steps away from my workplace so we usually head down there for lunch, for customer meetings, take co-workers out for lunch on their last days and just to unwind after work. Whenever we plan to head for Wilcox I always find myself asking what I'll eat! I don't eat meats but I am good with vegetarian and seafood options which Wilcox does not have alot of. Please make your poutine with vegetarian gravy (mushroom or soy, etc) or have that as an option atleast and add more vegetarian options. Vegetarians find themselves eating salad and fries for too much $$."}
{"text":"Overall review: Sets the bar way too high for itself when it's nothing extraordinary.

This place is super close to my condo which is very convenient, and while I like having a trendy place nearby, with drinks and music and a nice atmosphere, the food is just.. meh. They've got everything going for them, service is great, but the food just doesn't wow me. Maybe my expectations are too high, but they're high because of how they present themselves. Nonetheless, they're very successful and capitalizing on the lack of trendy, gastropub spots in Mississauga.
I've tried the pomegranate salad and it was a bit soggy. The nachos were just okay - kind of dry, not enough salsa on the side. The shepherd's pie was fine - I do like how it's made with lamb which is how a real shepherd's pie should be made. The mac n cheese is good. The bone marrow is far too greasy and bland. The carrot cake is fine, comes with raisins - warning for those who don't like raisins in their carrot cake. I've tried most of the cocktails and the lavender kiss is my favourite.
I've only ever been served by Taylor who is adorable."}
{"text":"My friend and I came here to try it out after hearing some good reviews. We ordered the lobster poutine and the mac and cheese dish. Service was good but food was just average - nothing special."}
{"text":"When I got to the place i was given a table for 4 but i had 6 people with me and to order our food it took about 45 min to an hour
Ordering drinks was quiet fast but food service was extremely slow.
the menu looked amazing and i was excited to try the food especially the duck confi wings and sliders.
After waiting about 45 min to an hour we finally got our food and it was extremely under seasoned the food lacked taste, it was almost bland, hopefully they fix it because i was extremely disappointed paying 20 dollars for one meal and receiving something that tasted like cardboard.
I do not recommend this place.
over priced for low end food with fancy names"}
{"text":"Great place! Fresh oysters.. And only for a dollar!.. Great vibe and great venue,  love the renovations!"}
{"text":"Disappointed to see a near threatened fish species (yellowfin tuna) on the menu without any certification of caught legally. Overall, beautiful restaurant. Went for steak, instead of the seafood. Portion was just right, where left full but not stuffed. Steak over cooked - as asked for medium and came out brown."}
{"text":"Fish tacos,  lobster poutine.  

Already two delicacies that are not known in Mississauga.  

But both were great.  Fish tacos were fresh,  tasty and full of flavor.  My buddy and I bought extras. 

Lobster poutine had a good lobster chunks and creamy  cheese sauce,  good for sharing.  

They really live up to the name gastropub."}
{"text":"I really wanted to like the Wilcox.  Since moving to the burbs from Toronto, the culinary experience has been missed dearly.  This place does a good imitation of some of the pretentious places downtown,  but still falls a little short. 

The location was nice,  with a cute walkway to the front,  and I appreciated the fresh herb garden outside the front. Nothing better than fresh flavor! 

But the food was a bit hit and miss.  My partner had the southern fried chicken which was great.  I ended up sharing it because my dish,  the 'steak frites' was such a disappointment. 

Personally,  I would be embarrassed to serve this dish at a resto like the Wilcox wants to be.  The steak was a poor cut; tough,  chewy and overcooked.  It seems like someone missed the memo on the frites,  too.  I was presented with a pile of thick cut French fries rather than the proper thin,  shoe string frites which is the whole point of steak frites. 

I did enjoy the chimichurri sauce on top.  It tasted fresh and added some color to the plate,  but shouldn't be needed on a proper steak frites.  The best part of my meal was probably when I asked for some mayo to go with my jumbo fries and got a delightful smoked hickory mayo/aioli. 

Steak frites is a very simple dish,  where the flavors should speak for themselves,  and the textures are a big feature of the dish.  Whatever I got fell quite short. 

Because the Wilcox is the only Torontoish choice I have found in the wasteland of chain restaurants in Mississauga,  I will probably be back and stick to the chicken. The churros for dessert were quite nice,  but I'm not sure if they were good enough to make this a top choice on my list of places to eat in Sauga. 

A little hot and cold with their food, so temper your expectations."}
{"text":"Came here for a corporate event and must say the service and apps were really good."}
{"text":"beautiful venue, went for lunch on a weekday. decided to try something new, went with a friend who's a culinary school graduate and she ordered the beet salad + beef tartare. She said the tartare was good but there wasn't enough bread to eat it with. The salad could fit in the palm of your hand but the waitress did make that clear when she ordered it. I ordered the duck, i was very impressed with the succotash on the bottom and the passion fruit sauce, for never having duck before it was an interesting experience. Something I probably wouldn't order again. The skin was good, i think because the duck was aged for so long it gave it a very soft mushy buttery taste which i didn't care for. All in all, honest attentive staff beautiful setting good food."}
{"text":"A few min walk from my house, delicious food, slightly pricey, but I would go back again definitely. Only bad thing is, it's sooooo loud inside, very difficult to make conversation."}
{"text":"Yelp needs to get  that half star .
I would give this place 2.5 if allowed .
It's a hit and miss in this place sometimes you food can be over cooked and dry .
Other times it's good .
Great engry in this place .
Prices are a bit high but it's some what up scale ."}
{"text":"Hidden gem in Mississauga. Love the atmosphere! It's a great place if you want to grab some drinks/apps on a Friday night and don't want to go all the way downtown."}
{"text":"Came to the Wilcox on a Friday night and it was pretty Lit. Upon arriving at the door, the two gentlemen (hosts) seemed to be more interested in a conversation they were having rather than seating my friend and I. When I asked if we could stand at the (lively-looking bar with dj), the gentlemen advised it was \"past capacity\" and led us to a table in the lower dining room.

The Wilcox seemed understaffed for a Friday night, with only one waitress serving the entire lower dining room of about 6-8 tables. She hardly came to check up on me, and when she did, it was rushed and not genuine. She got my drink order spot on tho; Hendricks Sonic with a lime. Unfortunate that a place called the Wilcox Gastropub did not have any cucumber to be muddled at the bar.

When asking the waittress for recommendations, she suggested a few sharing plates: nachos, coconut shrimp. When asking her about the duck breast she claimed it was delicious and nothing more. No explanation of went when into it, ingredients, cooking process, or justifying the price point. 

On to the food;

Wilcox Burger ($18) and the Duck breast ($36). 

The Burger was good. French fries were awful. Small, and burnt. A different server came to serve our food, and I asked him for mayo and hot sauce for my meal. I never saw him or my hot sauce, or my mayo, or my original server.... The duck was over-priced, over-cooked, and not worth $36! Do not order this dish. 

Overall the Wilcox Gastropub is an interesting place. Food is decent. Drinks are good. Service is spotty. 3/5 *stars"}
{"text":"Best fish tacos in town!! Ambiance is amazing and service is great even during peak hours. Definitely coming back!!"}
{"text":"Went with a group to celebrate a friend's birthday. My first time, and definitely not the last! The atmosphere is amazing, the staff is pleasant, and the food is pretty good!

I'm in love with the decor. Not a lot of places in Mississauga have such style, unless they're franchised. However, I think one uncovered lightbulb was just a little too low. We kept knocking into it, and it was not a pleasant feeling.

The lounge is awesome. They have a nice skylight, great seating, and the bar has a good selection. The bartender was very prompt, which is always a good thing!

They have an open kitchen downstairs, away from seating areas of course. And the food is quite good! A friend and I split fish tacos and a poutine. Everything was quite fresh and prepared well. 

Our server was absolutely the best. Water was always full, even though the place was busy. She gave us lots of time to order, answered all our questions, and was not pushy at all. 

Another thing to note is how clean the place was compared to other busy pubs I've been to on Saturday nights. 

All in all, a great spot to hang out. Can't wait for my next time!"}
{"text":"This place is beautiful. It's an old house that has been extensively renovated so that it retains the old-fashioned charm outside while looking sleek, modern, and airy inside. It's truly a stunning building. 

I tried the Wilcox burger and fries. The burger is supposed to come topped with an overeasy egg. My egg was more like over medium so I honestly could have done without the egg. If you're not going to give me oozy yolk, I don't need or want the egg. 

The beef was exceptionally good. It's a blend of chuck, shortrib and brisket, I think. It has the pleasant fatty taste of brisket. The seasoning on the burger was spot on. I would next time try to pare down the toppings on the burger. This beef doesn't need to be overly dressed up. 

The fries were fresh cut and crispy, but they were a bit salty for my taste. 

The prices are on the higher side, but it makes sense for the lovely venue."}
{"text":"The Wilcox is great. I wish they had oysters all the time, and not just on Tuesdays and Wednesdays when they do buck a shuck. I would pay more to get them any time. The wine list is decent, as is the beer list. Appetizer selection is fairly good. Everything is fairly well done."}
{"text":"Menu has a wide variety of unique dishes. We ordered the lobster poutine, Wilcox burger, and Mahi Mahi Tacos. All were delicious! Especially the poutine and burger. Happy hour is available up to 7 PM. 

The atmosphere had an upbeat vibe. Service was excellent!

Highly recommend this place!"}
{"text":"Went here for Buck a Shuck Oyster night(Tuesdays)! The oysters were so great, tasty and fresh. No \"fishy\" smell per say. We also got a Lobster Poutine. Both were so great! I am going back."}
{"text":"Meh. Nice venue, but their hvac system sucks. It kept blowing cold air at our table so we had to ask to move. Food was way too expensive for mediocre taste and portion! Was also empty for a 6pm prime dinner time."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere for an intimate dinner.  Service is friendly and efficient.  One of our favorite local places to go."}
{"text":"This was my first time here and I was pleasantly surprised.

Let me start off by saying you have to try the lobster Poutine!!! Order a beer as well because it is on the salty side but still amazing. 

The burgers here are amazing! They are thick, juicy and well spiced. Buns were nicely toasted and the bacon was thick cut!

I went on a limb and order the The Canadian
wilcox chuck (smoked aioli, peameal bacon, berry compote, white cheddar, frisee, maple onions) even though I was nervous of the ingredients it was really good! The sweet and salty mix in each bite is awesome. This is highly recommended and a must try.

The The Wilcox Burger pepper crusted Wilcox chuck (crispy onions, roasted red pepper aioli, goat cheese, arugula, sunny side up egg) is a great mix of ingredients, especially for someone who likes spicy food. The yoke from the egg spilling over onto the pepper crusted beef is to die for. Get other and try it!

The only thing I was not impressed with honestly was the Bang Bang Shrimp (coconut and panko breaded shrimp, adobo sauce, arugula, pickled red onion). They didn't taste like coconut at all and we found them way to oily. So disappointing as everything else was amazing. Maybe just didn't get the good chef that day. I dunno.

Overall this is a great please to eat and have a good time with friends. Late night and can't make up your mind come here you will find that thing to satisfy you. 

Happy eating!"}
{"text":"The Wilcox Gastropub has substantially gotten better since the first time I tried them during opening month! I took my date here and we had an amazing time. The atmosphere is very live with modern decor and live music playing in the background.

My favourite things to order are the Mac N Cheese, Fish Tacos, and Steak & Fries. My steak was very good! Soft and tender with a bit of seasoning and cooked the way I like it (medium). My date got the Korean Lasagna and it was really good and unique! It was lasagna with Korean spice seasoning. It's a good combination that I would have never thought of until I tried it at the Wilcox Gastropub.

For drinks, we each ordered a Bourbon Smash and a Sidecar. The Bourbon Smash has bourbon, lemonade, and (other things I forgot lol); the Sidecar has hennessy, orange, and (other things I forgot lol).

Overall, the Wilcox Gastropub has improved a lot! I recommend taking a date here or celebrating a birthday here :)"}
{"text":"Great service!!! I had the oyster for appetizer, it came with 3 sauces and it was really good. I had the Wilcox burger for main... not the best I had but still pretty good as well!"}
{"text":"great place in Mississauga, one of my favorite spots.Came here multiple times, and tried different dishes, all were good.

I have tried their lobster poutine- divine and flavorful

fish taco- was really good.

pulpo- which was an amazing seafood appetizer and chorizo was spicy. very flavorful

southern fried chicken was really good and tasty, and so was the fried chicken sandwich. all the food was very good and flavorful.

they have daily deals on drinks, so its great and overall you can dress up or dress casual, whatever you prefer and they have a nice patio.

they also give u a discount coupon for the next times. 

great gem in Mississauga since this city lacks good food spots."}
{"text":"Great food.   Nice atmosphere.  Service could be a tad better - lots of socializing between staff and not enough detail to client."}

{"text":"I was there for lunch with my family but the experience and the food was very disappointing. We ordered lobster mac and cheese for about $20 but unfortunately the lobster was fake lobster real lobster meat for $20. The burger I ordered medium rare was overcooked and very dry inside. On top of that we had to wait 20 minutes for the check. 

I would not go back again."}
{"text":"This place is great on the weekend. The DJ plays great music and the drinks are fairly priced. However, the food is very bland and overpriced."}
{"text":"Found this place by accident. Amazing food, service and atmosphere. The Scotch Egg was perfect, tomato jam with it is one of the best things I've ever tasted. The Canadian Burger was also perfect. Really, I just don't have a better adjective for it. I couldn't think of a single way to improve it. My only criticism, which really isn't one, more of an observation, is that the Macaroni and Cheese side I got with the burger was good. Great actually, as far as straight mac n' cheese goes, but after I tasted that burger, it seemed bland compared to it. It just wasn't as rich in comparison. I'd get the fries maybe next time. I'll be back soon and often."}
{"text":"Where's Wilcox? Well friend, I'd like to tell you, but then I'd have to kill you! Because I love the WIlcox so much that maybe I don't want to share that this old heritage home/pub turned trendy Gastro Pub, is nestled in between larger office towers near the corner of Hurontario and Eglington in Mississauga (oops, I've said too much already!)

But seriously, when there's a great spot like this blowing up in your backyard, it's ludicrous to try and keep it to yourself, you want to shout it out to the masses, tell your friends, your family, your religious leader -- all the people. It's a secret too big to keep to yourself!

When you walk in, the decor is top notch, I have to say, the perfect blend between rustic and contemporary design. Leather wrapped booths and grey frosted glass partitions in some areas, antler chandeliers in another, and in case you needed extra incentive there are several full on birch trees filling the main lounge area... just for good measure - so cool!

OK, so now for the really cool stuff - the food and drink! If you look at my pictures, you'll see that there is not shortage of Ontario Craft Beers and ciders on tap here, you literally have your choice of some of Ontario's best. I wasn't feeling a beer on my visit, but my server DID mention that they had cocktails! DING DING DING, winner, gagnant!!! What did I have - y'all know me by now, and Old Fashioned baby! Hells yeah! But not just any OF, a burnt one, served up with 40creek bourbon and an orange slice cooked on the grill, yum! Best of all, when I asked about what kind of ice they would be using, the bartender mentioned regular ice... I grimaced, but she quickly offered me an ice block instead... I smiled!

Ice makes a HUGE difference in a cocktail like this, so the fact that they went the extra mile and made the substitution before I could even ask was a big deal for me. The result: an amazing variation of the classic cocktail. I was very impressed!

For food, I took one look at the menu (should have known better) and realized calorie counting would not be possible. I mean with several kinds of poutine on the menu, gourmet mac'n cheese, and duck in more places then I could name, I was tortured! Luckily my server suggested that if I wanted to keep things somewhat light that I pair a couple of appetizers together.

I ended up going with the Fish taco appetizer (which came with 3 tacos) as well as the Wilcox Greens (served with chopped apples and beets).

The fish tacos were amazing! Usually, I'm a tad wary of deep fried fish in tacos, but the pieces were lightly battered and not greasy at all. Plus, topped with fresh made guacamole and a mindblowing poblano pepper sauce made me want to order it 3 more times (I didn't)... self control sucks!

The salad was perfect, I had the option of adding a protein to it but I opted not too this time around and the salad was perfect, not overly dressed, fresh light ingredients and a wonderful bright taste that made me feel good about eating this!

Overall, I was thrilled with my visit and I cannot wait to come back again. As some yelpers have mentioned, this place is new, and there may be the odd kink to work out, but the management and kitchen team seem to be rising to the challenge with each service to ensure nothing short of perfection!

Our party had the Kim Chee croquettes and lobster Poutine for apps and then had the Korean lasagna, steak and frites and the southern fried chicken. All were excellent. We also took advantage of the $5 drink specials. Everything was great. Would come here again if I lived in the area."}
{"text":"This is definitely the place to go In Mississauga if you're looking for a place with great food and atmosphere.

I frequently visit this establishment due to the consistent quality of food and service provided . 

The concept I believe is played on the building itself which is a historical home belong to the Wilcox family many years ago . The inside decor has a sort of cottage feel with contemporary finishes . It feels very sleek but cozy at the same time.

Food : there are so many options to choose from here , I'm usually very conscience of what I eat so I tend to stick with the the healthier options . Their ceviche is amazing, I also really enjoyed the warm kale salad. But if I'm ever indulging I normally go for the Canadian burger or the carbonara . It's good to note that all of their ingredients are prepared in house too."}
{"text":"Great atmoshphere, great food, great service. Have taken my team from work to this place and everyone loved it. They have deals on certain nights like top shelf drinks for 5 dollars. We have tried most things on the menu and I've never been disappointed. Burgers and steak frites are among our favourites."}
{"text":"So this place just went from a 4 to 5 in my books.

This time I forgot to make reservations. Wait for lounge seating was 20 mins but the people who arrived after me had a 45 min to 1 hour wait for regular seats. The place was packed on a Wednesday night at 6:30 pm. Make reservations before you go! 

After we were seated, a corner lounge seat opened up. And even though there were people in line, a request to move was happily obliged!

We were seated right at 7 pm (end of happy hour) but the waitresses still let us order a drink off the happy hour menu!

Wednesday is $1 oysters (as is Tuesday). We ordered a dozen and they were very fresh!! I'm definitely coming back for more soon.

For the appetizer, we shared a scotch egg. Let me tell you that I highly regretted sharing it! Soo sooo soooo good!! It's one of those appetizers that opens up your palate and makes you hungry for the main, as opposed  to making you full.

For the main, I got the pan roasted quail. This was my first time having quail. I didn't think I'd enjoy it, but it was surprisingly good! The braised red cabbage with bacon was delicious!

Lastly, I finished off the meal with baked alaska. It's a old fashioned dessert and that was just fine by me. It was homemade vanilla ice cream surrounded by a thin layer of cake, covered with meringue/whipped creamy goodness!! It was just heavenly!!

I had a 15% off email (join the VIP list on their site) all the way from October which I hadn't been able to use so far. But since it didn't have an expiry date I asked the waitress if it was still applicable. She had to ask the manager but came back with the bill adjusted having made an exception, even though it was an old promotion!! Can we say they really care about making customers happy??

The waitress was super friendly, but not in a fake way! All the food came out fast! Water was always topped up! Wine selection was great! Every whim was catered to!

I thought this place couldn't get any better. I was clearly wrong!!! 

Sooo ... GO!! GO NOW!!"}
{"text":"Visted here in the summer.  Very nice ambiance, very loungey.  You can easily meet up with some friends here and have drinks.  We were situated not too far from the DJ and I didn't mind as the music was solid.  
Came here for the lobster poutine and it did not disappoint.  Very good portion and good value for $$.  I would definitely visit again."}
{"text":"This spot was really impressive!  The decor of the restaurant made me fell like I was in a trendy venue downtown.  Two thumbs up on this one!

Along with a perfectly made Rusty Nail...had the oysters which were slightly disappointing due to our first dozen not being fresh, but once mentioned to the waitress, the manager came to our table and offered us half a dozen as a courtesy.  Those happened to be pretty awesome!  It was handled so quickly, didn't have time to form a bad opinion.  Totally appreciated that!

Had the Bang Bang Shrimp appetizer and the Spicy Chicken Wings... So tasty and explosive with flavour! Presentation was beautiful!  

I need to visit again and try something else on their menu!  Looked like so many interesting things!

Great spot in Mississauga!"}
{"text":"I've been here for oyster night and sadly they were out one night! So I recommend go early as possible!

I've tried a couple of dishes from their menu and food is average. Lobster poutine and burger is recommended, charcuterie board is not. Their board was not proportionate to the food served and therefore seemed empty.

If anything, I'll definitely go back for oysters and beer."}
{"text":"You know what? I never expected to find a restaurant this good in Mississauga!!

Everything was perfect at this place. Ambiance, food and service!

We tried their signature Burger and oh my.. The bun was so soft as if it just came out of the over. The patty, so tender! You don't feel sick or stuffed after having it.

We had the Burger with arugula salad as a side dish. Yummy! Why didn't we get fries with the Burger? Well... Because:

You. Must. Try. The. Lobster Poutine! You must! I didn't know what to expect when I ordered it but oh boy... when I had the first bite I knew I was in love! At least 4 different people were having it around my table - That's how's popular this dish is. They probably make 100 of them daily!

I will return. 5 star!"}
{"text":"After travelling 30kms, my friend and I came to the wilcox for her birthday dinner. As soon as we arrived we were greeted with a warm welcome and seated. Our server came and instantly informed us about the new menu and informed us about his favourite menu items. We ordered the nachos as a starter and steak and frites and the chicken milano pappardelle! overall we had an amazing experience and the food was worth the money! I will be returning soon"}
{"text":"had been to the Wilcox once before for drinks and I saw some tasty looking food walk by, so I had to come back. A trendy spot, it has different levels you can sit on and a glass ceiling in the bar area. The bar area has TVs on every wall and taps food love fabulous craft brews.  

Seated in the bar lounge on a sunny day, there was lots of natural light. There was could see a balcony that overlooked this area. We ordered some craft beer; my friend went with a beer from Muskoka and I had some Side Launch. As we browsed the menu, the Wilcox Burger and Steak Frites caught my eye. A woman at the next table was just finishing her Steak Frites and highly recommended them. I was sold! My friend also thought the Wilcox Burger looked good, so that made it easy.

The Steak Frites were everything I wanted. The steak was cooked to order and melted in your mouth. Just a dash of seasoning was all it had and didn't need anything else. It was topped with a healthy splash of chimichurri. Wow! The fries were tasty; I cleaned my plate! The Wilcox Burger was huge! There was a ton of toppings.  A big juicy burger patty piled high with crispy onions and arugula with a sunny side egg on top. My friend forgot about the egg when he took his first bite. Haha! #whenyolkattacks 

Our servers were great. Much like my first visit, they're all pretty cool with a good sense of humour. They were on point, keeping tables clear and glasses full. I really like this place; it's got a good vibe and comfortable seating.  

I'll definitely be back. I just hope I can choose something other than the Steak Frites!"}
{"text":"Stopped by the Wilcox Gastropub today for lunch with my girlfriend on her birthday.

The restaurant is as stunning on the inside as it is on the outside. The first server who greeted us and sat us down and explained some of the historicity of the building and made us feel very welcome. Then Christian took over and gave us his suggestions.

We had the fish tacos, lobster poutine and macaroni and cheese. Everything was way better than expected. The mac and cheese was so good that I practically had to fight my girlfriend for it. The fish tacos were also AMAZING. The poutine was good but just a tad salty.

All of the food is made from scratch and is nothing like the crap you find at places like Jack Astors/Montanas/Applebees etc. They obviously put love into their work and though their food is not cheap, it is well worth the price.

Our server was a big part of the experience and was very friendly and helpful. His suggestions were great and he was funny and professional.

At the end they brought us some churros as a birthday treat which was a nice surprise.

This place is a fantastic restaurant that serves fantastic food and has fantastic employees in a fantastic looking building.

Good job guys, keep up the good work."}
{"text":"Was at The Wilcox on a Tuesday night. Seat was immediately available. Staff was extremely pleasant, attentive and helpful. Great recommendations. Ambiance and decor was very comfortable and was able to have good conversations. Inside, the interior looks amazing - during the day and night with all of the natural lighting.

The food is purchased locally (fan of that!) and can tell the discernment in selecting ingredients.

I can't eat shellfish and so many things on the menu looked so good, wanted to try everything but here's what I ate:

Appetizers: 
- Kimchi Croquettes - These were amazingly good
- Mahi-Mahi Tacos - These were pretty good

Entrees:
- Korean Lasagna - this was amazing like REALLY good
- Grilled Duck Leg Confit - The duck was SO GOOD
- Southern Fried Chicken - This was really good and flavourful
- Rib Eye - the garlic and the rapini with it complemented it really well 
- Whole Red Snapper - Maybe because I'm Chinese...this was tasty
- Wilcox burger - Was told they make their burger in house and grounded daily, and it was good

Sides/Dessert:
- Fries - some good fries :)
- Dessert was bomb too

I ate enough for like two days...haha..."}
{"text":"We came here for a family dinner with our little one to celebrate someone's birthday and the staff at the Wilcox was accommodating the entire time! 

It's a stage set up, the seating area seems quite small but they've got a nice patio space and it's definitely quieter outside than in. 

We ordered several dishes to share: the kimchi lasagna, lobster poutine, Mac n cheese, buttermilk fried chicken, Mahi Mahi tacos, and the steak tatare. For six adults and a toddler, it filled me right now (though the husband could've done with a bit more). The food was fresh and delicious and the flavours were very unique. I especially loved the kimchi lasagna and the tacos, both were bold and had great contrasting flavours. The fried chicken and the poutine were very salt heavy, so they weren't high on my list.

At the end, the server brought out some churros for us to enjoy with the birthday girl, free of charge! 

The place is great for a date night or a small get together with friends. I love the food, the location is very convenient (Eglinton and Hurontario), and the service is great. I'd come back for sure!"}
{"text":"Finally had the opportunity to stop in for dinner last night before the Lenten season starts, so I felt the need to treat myself to something special. I had browsed the menu before and noticed an 18oz Ribeye steak. Steak is a touchy thing for me mainly because of past experiences at similar types of establishments... 

First off, the ambiance and the building itself are quite lovely. Dim lighting in the bar area, a dining room that is well lit and upper area seating. No matter where you end up, you will feel relaxed and find a great time whether with a friend, date, group or solo. 

The staff and service were excellent. Very friendly. Can't ask for much else.

The bartender made a flawless (to my expectations) Jack and Coke, it was the perfect temperature and was smooth.

The food? I gotta say, that Ribeye was unbelievably great! I ordered it medium temp, but it was a bit under, but let me just say this, medium might have actually been a mistake because the damn thing was so juicy, tender and satisfying. When you order a steak that is priced at $39, you're right to have high expectations and those were certainly exceeded. 

This is one place where I can honestly say that I want to try everything on the menu. 

Thank the Lord that Wilcox Gastropub is walking distance."}
{"text":"Decor/Location:
This place looks awesome.  The concept is both cozy and modern; a trendy combination for young adults and business people.  The plaza offers plenty of parking (at least for a weeknight).  It's near a busy intersection but the building is easy to spot - it almost looks like a big cabin/house.

Service
The staff are quite nice but I felt they were understaffed on the day I visited.  They were very attentive in the beginning when less people were around.  We ordered a 2nd plate of oysters that night and it didn't come until all of us were done our meals.  That's a pretty bad sign...I mean, it's oyster night, you might think to be ready for that?  Anyhow, staff didn't give us attitude, I just felt management could have done better with staffing.

Food
The oysters were really good for $1.  It's honestly a steal.  I wouldn't say they were the best oysters I've eaten, but they were cleaned properly, tasted fresh, and came out okay.  Can't really expect Vancouver quality oysters right lols.  To begin, the restaurant needs to be a little more flexible.  I really wanted to try the Wilcox burger but they did not allow customers to change any of the ingredients.  When the burger came out, it looked fabulous but the overwhelming taste of blue cheese engulfed the whole experience.  All I tasted was something dry (the bun), a bit of saltiness from the patty, and then loads of blue cheese lols.  It was so sad.  I felt the burger would have tasted a lot better if they toned down the amount of blue cheese they added, or even switched it to another type of cheese.  No one was really impressed by the meal, but they didn't complain either.  

I felt that the restaurant was pretty average but had lots of potential for improvement.  The prices weren't cheap, but $1 oysters...yeah that's something no one can ever complain about online."}
{"text":"Man! This is a great place! Came for a YEE, and just absolutely had to come back for the full menu experience. This really says something considering I like quite far from Mississauga to begin with!

A beautiful little place that has a modern, urban vibe. Great food paired with great drinks makes this a must try for everyone near and far! Got in and seated right away. Nice spot near the bar with lots of space. 

Ordered some wine and drinks, and started with some appetizers. Nachos were excellent, though the salsa was lacking a bit of punch. Pulpo was absolutely to die for. The combination of pepperoni, octopus, and potatoes with pesto was divine. Mussels were very good as well, though I didn't personally have any (allergies).

For the entrees, the Steak and Frites was great. Cooked just right and topped with pesto made this a win. The Seafood Fettuccini was good as well, just lacking a bit of diversity in some of the seafood variety in the bowl. The Braised Short Ribs were super soft and flavourful. Lastly, the Fish and Chips was gigantic! Very well cooked, but could feed a family of 4! 

For dessert, they didn't have a menu for it, but the server described the options they had. We got the Creme Brûlée, Chocolate Ganache, and Poached Pear dipped in Chocolate. Each very well made, as the Creme Brûlée wasn't too heavy, and Poached Pear very light and tasty! The Chocolate Ganache was a bit decadent by the end, but good nonetheless. 

Server was super nice, came to check on us from time to time, and very helpful. Overall vibe was a bit noisy due to us sitting near the bar, but not so loud you couldn't hear others at the table. 

I highly recommend this spot for anyone looking for a nice vibe, good food, and a great evening out!"}
{"text":"The Lobster Poutine is to die for, they also make great cocktails.
Definitely going back this weekend."}
{"text":"Came here for my friends bday dinner the other day and wasn't overly impressed with the food and service.

I ordered the scotch egg which was actually pretty good! I love my eggs, and this was a totally new way with some breaded-like texture pork sausage around the egg.

I also got the Wilcox poutine. Oh man, something about it was off. It the gravy tasted sweet but at the same time it tasted like it was plastered in salt. I didn't end up finishing it. Only good thing about it was the presentation of it in a hot stone pot.

Not sure yet if I'll go back, but if I do I will definitely try something else."}
{"text":"We went for a birthday party.  The restaurant vibe and ambiance is quite nice. Nice place to have drinks. Its not that big and the service was pretty good.

The food thou... we had a fairly large party and i was able to sample quite a few dishes. The food took along time to arrive but it was fairly busy inside. All the dishes visually looked really nice. For the price of each dish I expected a lot better. The dishes are quite expensive.

Every one left without any major complaints overall but had no urge to go back either. Disappointing and overrated. Do not go here for the food needs improvement. 

The Food by dish:

Scotch Egg: 1.5/5 The egg and pork actually was quite good but the sauce was so sour and overpowering it killed the dish. Not recommended at all. 

Pork belly and Baby octopus: 4/5 Quite good actually. Wish it came with some veg or potatoes thou.

Mac and cheese, spicy wings: 3.5/5 not bad but nothing special. 

grilled duck leg: 3/5 the duck leg itself was quite good but the succotash was very bland and not very delicious. 

Carbonara: 3/5 Not really tasty, pasta kinda chewy and needed more cheese. 

Braised short ribs: 4/5 Quite tasty but a little too greasy.  

marinated steak: 3.5/5 nothing special and a little chewy for my taste.

Deserts: 

Churros: 2/5 Was okay but prob would have been better if the sauce was on the side as a dipping sauce. Wasn't very crispy and definitely not pretty. The presentation of everything was quite good but this. 

Torrejas: 4.5/5 This was probably the best dish of the night. Needed some more fruit. The two sad blueberries were not enough."}
{"text":"Superb experience.. the food selection is great and the taste is amazing.. we had the lobster poutine, steak frites and Wilcox burger with goat cheese.. and the waitress substituted the fries with salad (her suggestion and it made a lot of sense)..
Everything was outstanding and the server was very attentive and keen on making us have a good time.. the only comment is that the lobster poutine should contain a bit more lobster since it's a 19 dollar poutine but other than that we had a great time and will definitely go again! 
Visit this cozy hideaway!"}
{"text":"Had another great night at Wilcox for my friend's birthday and everything was great!  From the group of friends, to the food and service.

Always a great place to go to! 

Even with our large group, our server was still on point!"}
{"text":"Da bomb dot com! After a month of self deprivation (Trying to look cute for summer time nah mean?) I finally gave in and visited The Wilcox. I did my research ahead of time, and made sure to order all of the dishes with good reviews. Can't say enough about this place, everything I ordered was perfection. 

Buck a shuck oysters on Tuesdays & Wednesdays was really what pulled me to give in. The oysters we're on the small side, but it did the job of satisfying my cravings and for only a buck, take my money! 

Fish tacos: Refreshingly delicious, and exactly what it should have tasted like. I've had fish tacos before, but never any good ones in comparison to when I had them in LA. The tortillas were super soft, the fish was lightly battered topped with a smooth guac and sweet salsa mix. It was perfectly seasoned and not very fishy tasting for a fish taco. 

Duck poutine: Amaze-balls! Fries were crispy yet there was enough gravy and duck to hit pan. Who would have thought duck would make such a great topping to a poutine. The meat was so tender and pulled apart at each scoop.

Scotched eggs: Interesting, very very interesting. To be honest I had a little one too many drinks by the time I had this dish lol. Crispy yet savory..that's all I remember.

I'm definitely coming back. The End"}
{"text":"I love this place, they have the best food, good music, best drinks, weekly specials, and are always changing up the menu.
I have yet to try something from here that I haven't liked! 
I love you Wilcox, thank you for bringing up Mississauga with this spot."}
{"text":"Atmosphere is sick, food is pretty pricey though! If it was cheaper I'd defiently give it 5 stars worth a try! The lobster poutine is a great shareable!"}
{"text":"I came by here today around 'happy hour' (4:30pm); however due to an early work schedule I was more than ready to have a full meal. Fortunately for me, they run $5 draft beer specials at this time - and quite generously until 7pm, along with a few other drink specials, and a tiger shrimp appy.

They layout is pretty interesting. It's a bit narrow (but not crowded) and multi-tiered with half-levels. It works pretty well as I was catching up with a friend I hadn't seen in awhile. I was in a dinning area that was a bit separate from the main bar - but not too far (it is a pub after all). The decor reminds me of the 'Movember' adds. Dark tones with wooden accents, and various 'manly' pieces, such as old leather snow shoes, antler light fixtures etc... Kind've a rural but urban, chic but rustic feel to it. Clean and open feel overall.

Service was top-notch and very attentive. I never had to wait long for anything, had many check ins with water refills. The staff knew the drinks and menu very well.

My friend (who clearly wasn't as ready for dinner as I) had the tiger shrimp and really enjoyed it. I ordered the California burger and went for house (Wilcox?) salad as a side. When it arrived, I joked with my friend as to which one the side was, because the salad was very large. I also believe there was no surcharge in having it over fries, which is impressive given that it was very nice fresh mixed greens (arugula, spinach, etc...), along with beets, apple, walnuts, quinoa and maybe a couple other things. Very impressive, and my only critique would be that the citrus in the vinaigrette could be a bit more evident.

As for the burger: the bun is brioche which they bake daily themselves. Perfect bun and just the right amount of buttery-ness without being too much. The real star was the meat which was cooked and seasoned perfectly. I believe they also prepare this daily themselves. The meat truly was the star and even has me craving for more at the time of writing. The cheddar cheese was evidently very good quality as well. It comes with salsa fresca, though for me the taste could've been bolder.

Just couple small things (vinaigrette and salsa) holding it back from a 5 - perhaps just a matter of taste. I'm looking forward to trying more of their offerings."}
{"text":"This place is the bomb! Didn't know such a happening place existed in Sauga! Love the ambiance, decor, service, menu, there really isn't anything not to love about this place! Would definitely be back here. In fact, this would be a perfect spot to celebrate a friend's birthday! 

Service - 5/5
Taste - 4/5
Portion - 5/5
Atmosphere - 6/5
Price - 5/5

Service - Excellent waitress who was attentive to our needs. She was very patient with our indecisiveness in our orders.

Taste - we ordered a dozen oysters, two glasses of white wine, the fish tacos and lobster poutine. Fish tacos was so moist it's a must here! Lobster poutine sounded very novel but there's actually not a lot of lobster taste to it so was disappointed by that. 

Portion - regular sized portions. Nothing out of the ordinary.

Atmosphere - love their music here. They were playing top 40s. Only thing missing was a dance floor lol.

Price - their dollar oysters and happy hour specials are such a hit. Come here before 7 and they have beer on tap as well wine for $5! If I lived in Sauga I would totally be a regular here."}
{"text":"Bang bang shrimp, fish tacos and amazing oysters. Not only has this place gone through a complete overhaul from what it previously was but the atmosphere and food are amazing. Highly recommended. I believe Tuesdays are $1 per oyster. The outside of the location may not look inviting but inside you're in for a treat!"}
{"text":"Came here on my birthday and had a good time. The interior was stylish. People were more dressed up than usual here but not overly formal. The price was a above average, which was expected given the environment and vibe of the location.

We had the roasted bone marrow for appetizer. This is the first time I had it and it was delicious! It was pricey but definitely would recommend have it again. Wish the portions were bigger.

I ordered the catch of the day, which ended up being sole with side of toasted almonds and mashed potatoes. They fish was battered and cooked like what you would expect from a fish and chips place, but this was much thinner and less oily. I'm a fan of toasted almonds so this was just a bonus. Potatoes had a good amount of butter in it, so no complaints about it. 

My friend had the smoked bacon Mac n'cheese. i had a small taste of it and it was nice and cheesy. However, I felt that it may have spent a little too much time in the oven since some parts of it were too dry.

For dessert, I had the Baked Alaska! My friend had recommended it and I can see why it was so highly rated. Presentation was nice and a great way to end the night.

Overall, I would recommend coming here for dinner if you're celebrating something and want to go somewhere classy but not too classy."}
{"text":"Service was AMAZING! Food was AH-mazing!!! Can I just say that I can't stop thinking about their chicken fetticini. (Love love love the pasta noodle) I'm the biggest pasta lover and Im drooling just thinking about that dish. Will be returning but in the mean time, I'll be telling all my family and friends about this hotspot."}
{"text":"I came here twice. 

The first time, we sat inside. It was ridiculously noisy (the interior has a weird echo to it) and smelled a little smokey. I found the atmosphere to be unpleasant because I could barely hear my company over all the noise. 

I ordered the bone marrow and mint chocolate bombe from their feature menu. While the bone marrow was delicious (and so was the sourdough that came with it!), I discovered halfway through my dessert that it had a hair in it. 

Once I made the server aware of this, she apologized profusely and asked if I wanted another but I had lost my appetite by then (and was a little scared that the new one might have the same problem). Instead, the manager came over and offered to take it off the bill. 

I came back a couple of months later for the patio because it is quite beautiful. I had the southern fried chicken sandwich and it was pretty tasty. The only critical comment I can make of my second visit here is that the beer is slightly overpriced compared to other pubs and restaurants.

All in all: good service, pretty but hit-or-miss food, decent atmosphere. Also, the bathrooms are fancy."}
{"text":"I came here with a pretty big party and we were sat upstairs.  Our table was loud, laughing, and probably distracted a lot of the other patrons if they would have   been upstairs with us...  luckily we were fortunate to be the only ones up there and we could tell as many inappropriate jokea as we wanted---just kidding we only told 2 maybe 10 of those. Our servers were all really attentive and handled our table of 25 ppl with tons of confidence and ease.  They did not look stressed out at all with our many demands for food, drinks, water, napkins, plates, and most importantly the birthday shots!

All of the food was delicious and made fresh to enjoy. I ordered the duck sliders and chicken pot pie and it was made to perfection. Others had the lamb, steak, burgers, poutine, and all of the food was just so damn good!!!  Our entire table was satisfied with everything Wilcox gave us.

We even enjoyed the awesome music they had playing through the speakers as well which added to the trendy, cool, and hip vibe the Wilcox gives out.

There is plenty of parking and the lounge area looks classy and chill but not too uptight.  I highly recommend this place if you are looking for a decent priced resto-lounge with great food!  PLUS... $5 drinks and beer between 3pm - 7pm you cannot go wrong!

In the words of the Terminator..... \"I'll be back!\""}
{"text":"Came here late on a Saturday, and got seated near the DJ booth on upper level. Music was a bit loud, but still bearable. Service was good.

Ordered the fish tacos, Canadian burger, and sesame seared ahi tuna salad. I won't order the fish tacos again. The shell was more like pita bread than soft shell taco. Thick and doughy. Made the 'tacos' taste more like mini pita sandwiches. Also didn't taste much fish in there. However, the Canadian burger and ahi tuna salad were very well executed. Burger was a delicious medley of flavours. Salad was nicely seasoned and balanced. The sesame on the outside of the seared tuna added a good crunch. Had fries on the side - they were mediocre."}
{"text":"I really, really want to stan for a restaurant in the 905 but they just keep missing the mark. This place is new and I'll give it another shot, but I don't think they've found their niche yet.  Is it a gastro pub? Fine dining? A club? Not sure yet.

The service was mixed. Server was definitely eager to start, but mispronounced just about everything we ordered; both wine and food. Some more training might be in order.  As the evening wore on, he completely forgot about us for long stretches at a time and let us sit with empty glasses for 15 minutes. He was however prompt with getting our bill and settling us up.

We ordered the bang bang shrimp since we snuck in for happy hour just before 7:00, which was a good dish; deep fried, breaded, butterflied shrimp in a sweet and spicy sauce with some cooling arugula on top.

For mains, my husband ordered the duck confit and I wasn't terribly hungry so I tried the grilled octopus with Russian salad.  All my instincts told me to just go with a typical pub dish but we thought we'd give the stuff punching up a shot.  The duck confit was inedibly salty.  To the server's credit, he actually gave us a gentle warning about it beforehand... \"The duck is marinated in salt for 24 hours, which gives it an... interesting taste. I'd recommend you eat it with the red cabbage slaw.\"    There have obviously been complaints.. tone the salt down on this one, guys. I didn't eat most of my grilled octopus because the three bites I attempted took a few minutes a piece to chew and swallow. If you're going to serve octopus that rubbery, at least give me a steak knife.  The russian salad ended up being my dinner.. basically a creamy beet and potato salad; nice concept but woefully under-seasoned.

I saw burgers, poutine, and fish and chips going to other diners that looked really great and I'll return with the hopes that this place will fill a need in 'ssauga for better than average pub food with a nice beer and wine selection (it could use 50% more Canadian wines; a $5 Tawse riesling at happy hour was the highlight of the experience) in an upbeat atmosphere."}
{"text":"Quaint little place serving very unique, fresh and delicious dishes. Ive had the lobster Mac and cheese and fried chicken. Absolutely amazing food and an interesting selection of cocktails."}
{"text":"The goods: Go here if you want to meet with friends for drinks. The place is really pretty and trendy, the music is great, and staff are pleasant. 

The real: Gave this one a 3/5 rating because we were disappointed by the food, and the existing Yelp rating set our expectations really high. Unfortunately, our food was poorly seasoned - vegetables were too salty, and the meats were bland or dry. 

We ordered the stake tartare (bland), the Wilcox burger (bland and dry), marinated steak (bland and it must have been a poor cut of meat because it was rubbery af)."}
{"text":"The decor, atmosphere and ambience of the Wilcox is what you would expect from a restaurant in the core of downtown Toronto, amazingly and conveniently for me, its in central Mississauga. 

The interior decor to me was like an upscale lounge, with a twist of old fashioned warmth ( the wooden accents like antler chandelier , two trees at the lounge and the railings leading upstairs.) overall, i loved the cozy yet sophisticated atmosphere of this restaurant. 
I notice sitting in the lounge that the bar has a variety of unique beer on tap, for all beer enthusiasts! 

Food came out quick, 15-20 minutes after ordering. 
The food was delicious, my partner and I ordered what the servers recommended:
-bang bang shrimp (bang on yummy )
-grouper ceviche (not your typical salad, very refreshing and light)
-scotch and egg (first time trying a scotch and egg, quite hearty for an appetizer!)
-beet salad (i looove beets but i would have preferred smaller bite sized beets)
-fish tacos ( my favourite appetizer to this day ) 

For Entres, we ordered:
-Fish & chips (love! especially their housemade coleslaw)
-Wilcox Burger (wasn't a fan of the idea of my burger with a sunny side up egg but this actually complemented the burger and was very tasteful - the burger entree also came with a side of fries of choice between two salads.)
I ended up finishing both my burger and my partner's fish and chips. 

For dessert:
-The creme brûlée, with cookies and apples on the side. ( right amount of sweetness, with the perfect texture of caramelized sugar crusted top) 

Overall, Service was friendly, attentive and fast, i did not have to ask once for refills or napkins! Food aesthetics were all appealing and were all a unique twist on traditional dishes. I would definitely recommend the Wilcox Gastropub for a small get together with friends/family, a cozy date or a lounge for casual drinks! 
Also, I've noticed they've introduced $1 oysters, pretty great considering I do not have to travel downtown or elsewhere for this.
I plan to come back to eat the same dishes + try out the $1 oyster."}
{"text":"Loved this place! Try the mac and cheese with smoked bacon and wings. Very diverse drink selection including local craft beer."}
{"text":"After reading all the reviews on Yelp and looking over the menu I had HIGH expectations for this place. 

I came here with my friends last night. My first impression of the place was that it was very modern, upscale yet very cozy. It had almost a cabin feel to it. The music was amazing! 
The whole atmosphere was very hip!

Now for the most disappointing part. The food...
We ordered the Bone Marrow, Mac n' Cheese, Fish and Chips, The Wilcox Burger and Poutine.

The breakdown for each dish:
Bone Marrow - you only get 4 little pieces of sourdough. The bone marrow was somewhat okay. Not good and not bad. It was very greasy. I expected more from this dish

Mac n' Cheese - oh man...so bland. It was literally cream and noodles! It wasn't seasoned at all. I had to ask for salt and pepper.

Fish and Chips - the worst dish of all! It was very wet and soggy for some reason. 

The Wilcox Burger - this was actually not too bad. It was tasty

The Poutine - meh, I've had better. 

All in all I wouldn't recommend the food here. This place is very over hyped for no reason. The menu was very over priced for bland food. If I absolutely had to, I would only come here for the drinks and the music. I would just eat elsewhere before coming here."}
{"text":"I was speaking to somebody that is more local to the area (I know, I know I live next door to 'Sauga) but I don't frequent this area that often.  This venue apparently has changed hands numerous times.  For whatever reason this place literally right on the south west corner of Eglinton and Hurontario seems like it is difficult to establish something concrete here as far as a business goes.  

I admit, I knew not of this place, this corner, this mall at all.  There was a recently a GTA Yelp event here but I did not attend it so really this was my first time seeing or going to the Wilcox.  

The structure itself looks old and when I say old I mean like pioneer age old, like something out of place like there's some sort of rural home that was placed here and everything else was built around it - from the outside...  on the inside you step in and you can see how the decor transform this historical looking structure into something much more contemporary... sleek yet classy and not pretentious.  

A fellow Yelper was holding a UYE (Unofficial Yelp Event) at this establishment and that is why I was here to get together and partake on a promotion going on this week called Burger Binge Week 2.0.  This week long GTA wide event basically has many establishments offering a promo burger for 5 dollars.  The burger offered by Wilcox was a burger with a fried egg, cheese and kimchi.  

Our party had settled upstairs in the corner and I had joined in on the fun.  I started off with a Flying Monkeys Smashbomb IPA which these days for whatever reason I have a taste for (Pale Ales) and this one was dark but not very hoppy even though I had to look it up afterwards it was 70 IBU.  That seems high considering it didn't taste overwhelmingly strong taste but a good taste.  The selection of beer here is decent but not as many crafts as I would have thought but still a decent selection.

I had ordered a pulled pork poutine to go with my burger.  The regular poutine was 10 bucks so I went 2 more bucks to get the pulled pork.  I wasn't going to get the lobster poutine because I can't really eat it even though it was just another 4 bucks more than the pulled pork.  

The burgers came out and the presentation was sort of nice.  The kimchi and egg really set a contrast of colors on an otherwise regular everyday food item.  Burgers I've had a few in my life and this one sadly fell into the just OK category.  The bread was spongy in that the texture was hard and dry kind of like a hard sponge.  When sourdough begins to get dry and spongy it's not the ideal bun for a burger especially one with an egg on it because it will do nothing to absorb the yolk that will break.  If I had to make a suggestion I'd go with a lighter bun with eggs for that reason alone.  An egg bun, brioche perhaps.  An improvement on the bread would do wonders.  I notice many places started using Ace Bakery buns and feature it on their menu as a hook.  I don't know anybody that doesn't like Aces as long as they are fresh.

The kimchi I ate about half of it before eating the burger and ate the other half in the burger.  I can't say it added much to the taste of the burger but it wasn't as spicy as I had hoped.  I like my kimchi borderline spicy hot.  The poutine to me seemed flat and rather bland.  I'm used to it being more salty.  I had looked but there wasn't any salt or pepper on the table so I just had it as is.  The fries seemed to be just stuffed into this round dish and the gravy was lukewarm and it just didn't seam piping hot as I prefer poutine to be, hot enough so the cheese doesn't have a chance to become hard again and where you have to wait for the gravy to cool off and the fries sort of have a chance at remaining solid and crispy.  Sadly the poutine was none of those things and it was the price of 2 craft beers.

While the establishment is very aesthetically pleasing and the service seemed ok I have to say I'm sort of disappointed in this place.  Their menu which I had a peek at before had items on there in the $$$ range.  If the simplest of items like poutine are served as such I'm afraid what a 37 dollar ribeye would be like.  Their burgers are anywhere from 15 to 19 dollars regular price meanwhile I seem to be almost complaining about a promotional 5 dollar version.  

Overall my bill came out to 37.70 after taxes and an auto-gratuity of 17% since we were a large party.  I had 2 beers ($12), the pulled pork poutine ($12) and the promo burger ($5).  

I'd like to come back but I'd like to read how this place progresses in the food department because as of now the service is ok, the venue is a lock but the food for the prices IMO need some work."}
{"text":"I loooove the food from here. Oyster nights for $1 are my go to. Everything I ever order from here is fresh and delicious, only downside is the price is a little high for what you get. Never the less I'd still be back!"}
{"text":"Third time here.
Very very unimpressed on my last visit.  First of all they did NOT honor the check-in reward.  The service was ok but everything else disappointed me.  When i got my burger, it was pink.  I had invited coworkers here seeing that it had ok reviews but i was then embarrassed.  Seeing that i have food handlers training.  I know the dangers of pink burgers.  Considering the high price of the burgers here, i expect nothing less of perfection.  You have been warned.  Here is a link for some quick knowledge on pink burgers.

{"text":"Took my friend here for her birthday. She ordered steak and frites. My boyfriend and I ordered a bit more food! We got nachos, fish tacos, lobster poutine and oysters ($1 each, we couldn't resist!). Everything was so good! Everyone was happy with what they ordered. The fish tacos, in my opinion, were the best! The tortillas were soft and my boyfriend loved that they put guacamole in it. The lobster poutine was also good, but I found it a bit salty.

Our server was nice and helpful, and our food came out quite quickly. I would definitely come back here again! For the tacos and oysters, yum!"}
{"text":"Came here for UYE on burger binge week. I ordered a burger (duh!) and I washed it down with Kieth. Burger had a fried egg and kimchi for toppings... It was delicious (picture below). Service was A-OK. I really appreciated the fact that our waiter took the time to split our bills."}
{"text":"When I saw this, I was really excited that an interesting restaurant opened up near my work. There's only so much pho, shwarma and sushi I can take. Came here for lunch with my baby to meet with a co worker. She told me that the bar that used to be here was a dive, and it's nice to see something new. 

Around 12pm, the place was empty. It was Thursday afternoon, I was surprised. There was an accessible entrance that was all around the front of the place. There are two levels, the main dining area downstairs. we were able to be upstairs with the stroller. 

The menu looks interesting with salads, sandwiches and some interesting burgers. I was craving a burger and ordered the wilcox burger that came with cheese and a fried egg. The burger was good, but I could have done without the fried egg. The other burgers looked good too but I don't know if I could really have an 8x burger with a peameal bacon on top. It was just too much. Imagine if I had to go back to work!

Food was a decent size tho. And fries were good - crispy and salty. 

I would come back again and try something else on their menu. It all looks really interesting. 

To get in, enter thru the parking for the mastermind plaza"}
{"text":"I think I found my favorite pub in Mississauga. They have a great beer selection which I haven't found much of in the Toronto area. In the states the craft beer craze is every where but not so much in Canada, at least this part of it. However the exception to that is the Wilcox, they had a couple of really good IPAs. 

I was by myself so I sat at the bar. I really like the vibe of this place. Turns out it's originally a house from back in the 1800s. 

Food is good, very interesting menu. I went conservative and did a fish & chip which was very good. Bar tender was great as well. 

I'm definitely going back next time I'm in town."}
{"text":"Great little hidden gem!!! Loved this place went there last night with my other half and it was a hit. The food was great and they also had a DJ. I had the kimchi burger. In house bun was nice and soft I really enjoyed it. The MUST try is the lobster poutine!!!!!! Overall a great place would recommend to anyone and everyone. Great job guys"}
{"text":"Okay, so I've been here a few times and I think this place is better than what it used to be.  

Likes: Generally, the food is well prepared.  I've had their Wilcox Burger (super yummy), fish tacos (pretty good) and a special Yelp Kimchi Burger (I prefer the Wilcox one).  It is roomy with two floors and a patio.  Service is generally pretty good.  On my last visit, we had a big table and the server got the bills mixed up but took the time to fix all of it, so I'm okay with that.  

Dislikes: Even for a pub, I find it kind of pricey. The Wilcox burger is $17 and even though the beef patty is hand-made and it comes with an egg, it is still quite pricey considering you have to add tip to it.  I would expect something like $15 max.

Verdict: Good place to hang out with friends, but not a regular lunch spot."}
{"text":"A local gem! I highly recommend The Wilcox Gastropub if you're looking for something new to try.

The fish tacos are by far the best I've ever had. The staff was extremely attentive and our food came out quickly! Try to make it in time for wilcox hour (3pm-7pm), where many drinks are only $5!

{"text":"One of the trendiest looking restaurants in Mississauga offers great food. 

My favourite is the Pulpo, a mix of crispy almonds, grilled octopus, tender fingerling potatoes and saucy chorizo sausage. Another can't miss order is their French Onion soup, or a Pomegranate Salad. If you are craving something sweet try the baked Alaska, a pile of chevy marshmallow coated ice cream. This place has very friendly staff and is a great place to bring a date or business partners for a cozy lunch. Wilcox is a treat for the eye and the palate. Designer of the place managed to merge the modern look with the heritage past of the building ensuring a spacious cozy interior. I personally hate Tv's in any establishment but this is a bar after all. It is a nice touch that they have seating away from the bar area offering for traditional dining experience. 

Don't hesitate trying new things on the menu, the place always delivers."}
{"text":"The menu here is full of fabulous choices including pork belly, linguine carbonara, Korean lasagna, southern fried chicken and ponzu marinated steak.  There was no wait when I came for dinner on  Tuesday night.

$1 oyster Tuesdays - The oysters are on the smaller side, but they were fresh and tasted great.

Lobster poutine $22- This is probably the best poutine I've ever had.  Instead of gravy, they used béarnaise and it complimented the fries and lobster very well.

Ramen $17 - The pork broth was a little bland, but had a good base flavor.  The egg and mushrooms packed a lot of flavor and the noodles were nice and chewy.

The ambiance is classy yet casual.  Service was great.  The restaurant is on the corner of Eglinton and Hurontario.  It's part of a plaza with plenty of parking in the lot.

{"text":"great place for some drinks and if you're lucky you could wheel in a 10 if you know what i mean ;). mac and cheese was okay but the lobster poutine was excellent although i wish i had more lobster. the wilcox burger is also a must have!!!!"}
{"text":"Ambiance is great! But it all goes down hill from there!

Went twice just to give them a second shot!

I had the Wilcox burger ' not much flavor and it was $17.00

Also ordered the southern fried chicken and it was not cooked. 


Waitress told me it was their brining process!"}
{"text":"A reason to step into that \"house\" after years of passing by it to go have dim sum at emerald.

Cute little gastro pub that has two floors and lots of stairs. The interior is furnished with wood from too to floor. The front entrance is a little confusing when approaching from the parking lot but it could be fixed with a sign on the side red door. 

8pm on a Tuesday night and the top floor was packed. I noticed that about half of the clientele were Asian. It was loud with dim lighting And it felt like a warm house filled with family, friends and laughter. It has the perfect atmosphere. 
 
My friend and I got seated in the corner on the top floor and didn't get water for 15min until we got their attention. Cocktails were made from similar ingredients so I felt like there wasn't anything to unique to it. Plus there was too much ice in the cocktails.
We ordered two dozens of oysters, 2 cocktails and fish tacos to share and our little table could barely fit the two dozens and drinks all at once. Should consider using plate towers to maximize space. Or being out the good one at a time although it wouldn't be all that enjoyable...

Two things that bugged me the most: utensils are not fit for the good served or maybe the server doesn't know better and the food descriptions. Oyster sauces were not served with little sauce spoons until asked and spoons were served with desserts that were plated on a flat surface (that's like asking the dessert to jump off the plate)

Like all new restaurants, there are always room for improvement!

Looking forward to more unique dishes in the future :)"}
{"text":"The atmosphere had a upbeat vibe.   We ordered korean lasagna and tandrooi pork chops, both meals were excellent. The service was excellent as well."}
{"text":"First time and I was not disappointed. Amazing customer service, the food was amazing, fancy but casual; I would absolutely come back no doubt about it! The interior of the place is modern, with bits of nature which ties in all together. Can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"I had a late lunch so I wasn't overly hungry, just wanted a good drink and some apps.  My co-wprker and I each had a scotch egg, which was awesome.  I never had one before with a soft yolk instead of hard, very good.  Nice salty sweet combo.  We also shared the korean wings, nice and spicy.

The two different bourbon cocktails i had were great too."}
{"text":"It's so hard for me to rate this place with 2 stars when it has such good ratings.But I swear by the moon and the stars that I need to speak the truth!

Here it is for me:-
Service: 5/5
Ambiance: 5/5
Food: 2/5

Now this place as many know is on the intersection of Eglinton  and Hurontario and is definitely a beautiful piece of architecture.I walked in and fell in love with the trendy yet cozy feel of the place.I love the 3 level concept reminds me of lots of places in NYC.The decor and lighting is minimal.The glass ceiling gives this place a wonderfully feeler!

The service given to us was absolutely top notch.Our server was quick and kept checking on us if we needed anything.The food that we ordered came out in no time.

BUT THE FOOD WAS BEYOND HORRIBLE.I came in with such high expectations but as soon as I took my first bite I was totally shattered and disappointed.So we ordered fish tacos and Wilcox burger and shared between us.The fish tacos were a joke.No flavor whatsoever.I can literally make better at home or even Chipotle has better tacos.There was no taste, the fish was soggy, the guacamole used on top was like a paste instead of the real deal!It was a 1/5.Tacos are made on thin small pita instead or tortillas I mean common don't mess with authenticity.The owner/chef must go and try fish tacos elsewhere to see how they are done.I mean I can go on and on and on..how can you not make good fish tacos?!?

Now the burger was ok.A 2/5.The patty lacked flavor and salt!It was slightly burnt from one side too.It wasn't juicy at all which is a big put off for me.Burgers=Juicy!For $17 this was literally a crappy burger.Also it came with no condiments we had to call our server for ketchup twice.Well when a customer is getting a burger and fries pls dump a bottle of ketchup on the table at once or serve the platter with ketchup.Right?

Overall I see myself coming here for drinks and all but I won't be spending my money here on food."}
{"text":"Great place. We were in town for business and sat at the bar. The bar tenders were fantastic and the service was amazing. The food was excellent as well. We got the chicken pot pie and the Wilcox burger and bother were great. They have a fun beer selection with all local craft brews. Awesome place."}
{"text":"This place is awesome. Atmosphere, food and people are great. You have to come see it for your self. No need to drive downtown. The action is here."}
{"text":"Really good food and mixed drinks. I had the scotch egg and a burger with a salad on the side. All were delicious. Weird location but very tasty."}
{"text":"Been here many times.  Haven't been disappointed yet.  Slowly working my way through the menu but this place is a must try.  Best gastropub in the area!!  Braised short ribs with the side dish of lobster is my favorite so far...  Great drink selections too, lots of craft beers on tap and good happy hour specials.  Staff is awesome, everyone cares about your experience."}
{"text":"Came here for lunch because of the Yelp burger binge week. For starters, I found lots of pathways and staircases leading up to the main entrance a little excessive - feels like you're walking through a tiny maze.

I ordered a Wilcox burger with fries ($17), and my colleague got the Yelp kimchi burger ($5). Given that the place was pretty busy, the wait time was around 35 minutes - borderline of what I would consider acceptable. The waitress was quite nice and apologized for the wait. When I asked for a virgin mojito ($5), she warned me that it would no be as good as a regular one. I agreed to cope with it given that i was driving.

I was pretty satisfied with a burger - it was not a revelation but a normal solid burger. I liked the way it was served on a long platter with a basket of fries. My colleague like the Yelp burger. Her only comment was that it was quite thick and hard to bite. She got after that burger, while I was in a perfect state of being a tiny bit hungry after finishing my burger with fries.

I was positively impressed with some of their drink prices - you can get a single of Oban for $12. Some places in Downtown Toronto request as much as $35 for a single."}
{"text":"Good: 

Service is top notch
Location

Bad:
Food is very substandard
Music 

We ordered a nacho that came out to 30 dollars: 18 for nacho, 3 for guac, 6 for chicken.  They did not offer beef as an option.  This nacho was 2nd worst nacho I ever tasted.

Fish taco was decent.

Octopus pork - waste of money, overly cooked, small portion, tasteless.

Verdict: This is a great place to meet for a drink, that is centrally located, near downtown Mississauga.  Stay away from food.  Two of us paid 75 dollars for a dinner with no drinks, but tasted like 15 dollar food.   Maybe at one point their food was better, but at this point, they have ton of customers and they don't give a crap about serving good food.  This place is all about the good location and drinks.

Further observation:  Need to be careful with Yelp
In the past, it was good enough to see how many stars a business was rated at, by how many people and peruse some pics, and you probably make a good decision on a business.  Now the game has changed.   I think the business owners have caught up on the game and somehow \"influenced\" the rating.  There are many ways to do this.   I would be careful and spend a few min actually reading the comments.   Have I done this for Wilcox, I would have pass on this place, and save $75 and not ruin my date night with my wife.

Be careful out there consumers!"}
{"text":"Visited here in search of a good craft cocktail, my friend ordered me the Manhattan with a maple twist before I even sat down. It was too sweet for my taste, so next time I'll order my own lol 

We got started with the happy hour bang bang shrimp while Matthew M. and my friend took advantage of their $5 draft beer specials. The bang bang shrimps were... BANG ON lol it had to be done :) They were a good size, crunchy and the sauce that came with it compliment it well. We also ordered the duck confit buns and it was pretty good, the brioche bun was a little bit much but as sliders that's mostly expected. 

For mains we had a burger (didn't try but it looked massive) the lobster poutine and fished tacos. I felt that the poutine could have been done better, we didn't really see any lobster pieces but the gravy was good. My friend found it too heavy and couldn't finish it on his own. My fish tacos were good but once again as expected in a pub the food was heavy so my friends helped me finish them up. The next time I think I'll try a different poutine and one of their many main courses.

We had their creme brulee for dessert and this was great, the burnt sugar on the top was so delicious I almost fought them for it and the presentation was pretty.

The ambiance is 100% different from when it used to be Scruffys and the service is generous and friendly. Their bar is the main focus when you walk in and it's done beautifully, as is their half open kitchen and furniture. Our servers (we had 2) were both talkative and knowledgeable about their menu. I had the pleasure of meeting quickly with one of the owners to discuss possible options for events and he was very approachable. 

I'm going to head back for their $1 oyster specials and their happy hour specials :) It's definitely a nice and exciting new place in town!"}
{"text":"Really cool little place that might be easily overlooked. The service was excellent and I never felt rushed at all.  I had the lobster poutine and the churros for dessert. Both were fantastic."}
{"text":"The environment is incredibly warm and welcoming and the staff are all very kind and cheerful. The food is nothing like any other in the area. The chefs have created some amazing experiences, for me the korean lasagna and the lobster poutine are especially good. The food overall is always cooked perfectly to order with good portion sizes. The last time I went I tried the rib eye which melted in my mouth and was absolutely delicious. Though it seemed a bit expensive, I couldn't argue with the quality of the food. I come here pretty often as they have more of a lounge environment past dinnertime and they do have TVs everywhere for sports entertainment. A great place to eat and cheer on our local Toronto teams with customers and staff alike. If you have never been you will have a great first experience no doubt! A gem in the heart of Mississauga!"}
{"text":"Decent place, may be I was expecting more. Food was okay. I sat at the patio which was pretty good. 
Ambience was definitely 4/5."}
{"text":"The Wilcox is great if you're looking for some twists on some classics but can be a hit and miss on some of their items. That being said, I had a great experience and would love to come back to try the rest of their great menu. 

The atmosphere was incredibly relaxed and cozy as it is in a restored century home. The service here was also great.

The best dish we had was definitely their classic Wilcox burger on a brioche bun. The patty was done medium and everything worked so well. The goat cheese, with the egg, and the fried onions. The brioche was great and had a fluffiness yet with a chew. The fries were also hand-cut and good.

The Korean lasagna was also pretty tasty despite being on the dry side (think lasagna without much tomato sauce). But I liked the concept with the wonton wrappers as the dough. The fried wrappers also added a nice crunch to it. I expected more of a kick from kimchi as I wasn't able to taste it. 

The yellowfin tuna salad was a bit more disappointing. The vinaigrette didn't do too much to the salad and was lacking as well."}
{"text":"Admittedly, The Wilcox has gotten substantially better since I first tried them last April. For starters, they no longer serve those duck confit sliders.

Everything I've tried there since has been quite good, and their cocktail menu and drink specials are fantastic!

My person favourite dish is their lobster poutine. It's one of the best dishes I've ever tasted. The bernaise sauce they use is extra buttery and the flavour is out of this world. It's worth the $17.

Another personal favourite is the pulpo, also priced at $17. Octopus, chorizo, potatoes, and salsa verde. Great appetizer for sharing.

Can't forget about the scotch egg ($10) as a starter either!

The Wilcox is a great restaurant all around."}
{"text":"My boyfriend loves to come here! Especially on oyster night (buck a shuck). I like the vibe that Wilcox has it ambience and decor gives it a nice modern business feel. The food here is good but it's a little more than what I would want to be paying for. My go to is the Canadian burger (4/5) soooooo good, the lobster poutine (3/5), the oysters(4/5), and the churros(2/5)."}
{"text":"Excellent ousters on Tuesday deal. The octopus was a stellar choice the bone marrow and fish tacos were good too. The lobster poutine was great the mac and cheese was yummy too. Giant burgers! The sour wasn't quite sour or boozy enough but service was good. Great food for the price point"}
{"text":"This is my go to place. The atmosphere is amazing and the food delicious. The lobster poutine, churros and scotch egg are a few of my favs. I always go on Tuesdays and Wednesdays when oysters are $1. The servers are also friendly and provide good service."}
{"text":"This was our second time coming here. First time we came on a Wednesday for buck-a-shuck oysters. We ordered 30 of them, and a wilcox burger. Oysters were small, which is understandable considering they were only $1. Our server was very nice and informative. Food came promptly, and the atmosphere of the place is very relaxing and welcoming!
Second time we came, I got fish and chips (substituted the chips for mashed potatoes). The fish was much too oily for my taste, but maybe that's just me. For dessert we ordered creme brûlée and a baked alaska. This was my first time having baked alaska, and it was a bit too sweet for me. Creme brûlée was very good though, had a very crisp brûlée on top."}
{"text":"Third visit here now, this time I brought coworkers and we went for lunch.

Nachos: Great again - coworkers said chicken on side was really good.

Lobster Grilled Cheese Sandwich: 4/5 of us ordered this! We unanimously agreed that it was very tasty BUT we expected a larger size - more cheese and bigger slices of bread.

Everyone really liked the fries, though they were a bit too salty for me. 

One coworker asked for gravy on the side for her fries - 3 of them tried it and they all hated it (one said it tasted like fennel seeds, another that it tasted like burger grease...)

Wilcox Burger: Coworker ordered and was happy with it - said the beef was really juicy.

Looking forward to trying their fish tacos soon!"}
{"text":"Came on a Saturday for lunch.  It was a nicely designed restaurant with and open kitchen.  The bar is lower level in a solarium which is quite nice.  Restaurant was empty except for another family.  It was expected, it is after all a beautiful warm Saturday afternoon in August.  We chose to sit at the bar to watch the Blue Jay game which they gladly switched from the Roger's Cup.  The bar tender was friendly and talkative without being interruptive.

Drinks:  Mojito, which bartender raved to be the best in the west end.  Certainly high up there.  2 glasses of chianti and a prosecco for the end of meal.  Prices were reasonable and comparable.

Food: Pulpo, duck poutine,  braised short ribs, Wilcox burger and Churros for dessert.  Prices were appropriate for the quality of food you are getting.    

We plan to visit next time in the evening to see how the restaurant is.  This place is a gem in Mississauga.  The food definitely is a reason to return.  I'd like to see how the atmosphere is at night.  The service was good  considering by the time we left about 20 people were there and she was the only server.  She was quick and efficient and attentive.  We need more of these quality gastropubs in Mississauga."}
{"text":"First of all! $1 Oysters? 
Amazing food quality and overall ambience, the servers were not pushy, extremely attentive, and always showed up at the right moments

We ordered a dozen oysters, the pulpo appetizer, chicken pot pie, and bread pudding to share between two people and could barely stand up by the end of the meal. It was a perfect mixture of gourmet and comfort food and we thought the prices were decent. Personally, would recommand the pulpo and the oysters (they are from PEI)

Will definitely return next time to try the burgers and the braised ribs (as suggested by our waitress)"}
{"text":"This is a great spot if you're in the area and looking for something a little bit fancier. There's a great vibe with awesome decor And the service was very good.

I had the Wilcox burger and it was perfectly done medium well. Super tasty, juicy, savoury, eggy, and a perfect warm bun to hold it all together. This burger was about $18-19 and well worth the price. We would definitely go back to try some if the other items."}
{"text":"I was mainly really happy about the service here. The waitress was super friendly and very accommodating. My friend and I wanted to make use of the happy hour and she made sure we did. The waitress allowed us to order a drink each even though it was just 10 minutes past happy hour. The atmosphere here is fantastic. A great place to grab drinks & catch up with a friend. 

The Wilcox does a buck an oyster during Tuesday and Wednesday, so this place makes it a fantastic place for some happy hour drinks and $1 oysters!

As for the food, I'd say it was just okay... except for the fish tacos, which was absolutely delish! However, we only ordered appetizers - pork sliders, confit chicken wings and of course, the fish tacos. I will be sure to give some main dishes a try next time!"}
{"text":"Place nicely lited and nice atmosphere. Reservation was easy to get. We went on good friday so not to many ppl. Suprised they were opened. Their wilcox burger was amazing. Cant ever go wrong with fried egg and goat cheese on ur burger"}
{"text":"Came here on Wednesday with a friend after working in the area for the day. There was a yelp event at this place a few months back but I missed it but heard many positive feedback from my yelpers, so on a day where Jays is playing Game 5 in the ALDS, my friend and I decided to come here for a visit.

Arrived at 6pm and it was already pretty packed because of the Jays, but because they have two floors, we were seated on the second floor which was nicely decorated!  Our server was super nice and friendly, always a big smile on her face to make the experience that much better and as a bonus, asked if i wanted to be seated closer to the TV on the first floor to follow the game!

Wednesday was a buck a chuck, but my friend is not a big fan of oysters, so we didn't order any.  For two people, we ordered the Lobster Poutine to start, I ordered the Chicken Fettuccine and my friend ordered the Chicken Pot Pie.

Lobster Poutine was GOOD, very good fries, good gravy and cheese, a few lobster meat and it was also very good!  The Fettuccine was alright, nothing really special but not bad when it comes to the texture of the pasta and the sauce, but chicken was a little rough.  Chicken Pot Pie, the pie dough wasn't puff enough when it arrived, but it was a large portion and was quite delicious.

I will for sure come back again another time if I am in the Mississauga area!"}
{"text":"Beautiful upscale decor. Scotch eggs are to die for!"}
{"text":"Visited during the summer for drinks. Not a bad spot to relax during patio season. Inside  interior is nice too. 

Only went for drinks but staff were nice and accommodating. I think they should promote their specials more or have it disclosed somewhere more prominent for customers to see though."}
{"text":"Good service. Good atmosphere. 
Food was subpar for the price. I ordered the southern fried chicken and there was not much flavour, and the meat itself was a little rubbery to be honest, not to mention the dish was $22. Big portion I supposed (they gave me almost half a chicken) but if the meat is not cooked well there's no point in giving me a lot of it.

Might come back to have some drinks and apps with peeps, but probably won't come here to eat. Maybe I should have known that in the first place..."}
{"text":"Cute place I have visited twice. The steel and fries are a popular and great choice.  I also tried the lobster poutine. Turns into a nice lounge on Friday nights with great music definitely would go back. If the weather is nice you should sit on the patio."}
{"text":"I made a recent visit with a few friends and coincidently it was oyster night! Awesome!! We arrived for 6pm and there were still plenty of tables as we did not make any reservations and it sure did fill up quickly. 
Our server was great and attentive. No complaints with service. We all pretty much ordered burgers and one of my friends got the mahi mahi tacos. It would be great if we could substitute the goat cheese in our burgers to something else as that was the only unpleasant thing about our burgers- just a preference thing for my friend and I. We liked the patty as it was cooked to perfection. I personally liked the fried egg a lot but I like eggs in general.  

We started with a dozen oysters and they came pretty quickly. They were from PEI and they were pretty good especially it was $1 per piece. We ordered another dozen after we finished our entrees and the oysters seemed to take longer to come but the restaurant was packed. I do not think my friends and I minded a bit of the wait as we had good conversations going but I could tell the table beside us was waiting for their orders to be taken for quite a while. 

Another note, I was a bit surprised that they did not offer a soup. On the floor we were situated on, there was a sign with the soup of the day and catch of the day. It would be great if there was soup especially in the winter time.
Note the prices for Wilcox is on the pricey range for the central Mississauga area. Also, there is no distinction with the appetizers and entrees but take note of the pricing. The $1 oyster special is on Tuesday and Wednesdays so if you love oysters you will where to go!

Overall, we had a good time and experience at Wilcox I'd say. I would not mind an oyster night every week!!"}
{"text":"One best places to meet up with some friends for some good eats. The decor is a take on an upscale modern pub. An intimate setting for you and your guests to enjoy a nice night out without a trip to Toronto.

They have a good selection on tap with a good range from local breweries, their cocktail list isn't as extensive as I would have hoped but for Mississauga it's not too bad.

Now the most important part the food. The food descriptions on the menu sound more impressive than it actually taste. I had the California burger, the bun and the burger were perfectly cooked however the toppings were under par. The burger didn't taste fresh and was priced to be more expensive than i would have expected. 

If you're looking for a good place to hang out for some good drink deals with some friends without going to Toronto this is the place to be. But if you're looking to a place for a good meal, I'd head down to Port Credit for some good eats."}
{"text":"I've been back a few times since my first initial visit.  (I actually forgot to check-in during those return visits, so ignore what Yelp says to the left of this revised review, lol)

I think the issue with the slow service that seems to be what most people complain about occurs when you're seated upstairs as there isn't always a staff member up there.  I've sat both by the bar, upstairs and in the room immediately to the right when you enter the restaurant.   Service was way better on the main floor as it's easier to flag a staff member down.  Upstairs, not so much... This has happened to me and it may not be entirely what others have experienced.  On one occasion, it took about 10 minutes after seating down that someone finally came upstairs to take our order.  Most restaurants would have a wait staff approach a table within a minute of diners being seated, to take their drink orders at the least or even bring them some water.

Anyway, on my return visits I've had their other samplings such as the lobster grilled cheese, raw oysters on $1 oyster nights, the poutine and steak.  All top notch in my opinion.  I find their menu for a gastropub most appeals to me and has the right mix of meat and fish from pork, beef to even tuna! This place is definitely not for vegans, which to me, is great because I'm a carnivore 100%!! 

As the Wilcox approaches the busy Christmas season, I hope they can tighten up the service issues a bit, especially that pesky 2nd floor.  I'd place a staff member up there permanently on busier nights just so diners don't feel so neglected."}
{"text":"Just returned from lunch with a couple of colleagues at the Wilcox after hearing good things about their burgers. The service was subpar from the get go.  We were left waiting for a significant amount of time before being seated. Then when the food came out I the side orders were all misplaced between each burger. In addition I was given the wrong burger. After this we waited for another 10 or 15 minutes just to get the cutlery.

To make matters worse when the correct burger arrived it was overcooked ,when I specifically requested that I wanted it medium rare. Rather than taking responsibility for the mix up and comping the meal, the waiter kept asking me if I wanted a free beer when I don't drink.

All in all I was left paying for an overcooked burger while 30 minutes late for work. Thanks for the great lunch :("}
{"text":"Very dark pub with horrible music, wings came out cold when I advised they were cold I received attitude and then the wings came back hot but were chewy so definitely microwaved I had one and left the rest"}
{"text":"Really great ambience & drinks. Food however  was a disappointment. The reviews on Yelp say the fish tacos are good, but in my experience they were dry and bland. They have Bone marrow on the menu, which is amazing and rare in this part of town, but the kitchen was out so I could not taste this dish."}
{"text":"Service was very attentive here. The cod was very moist and cooked well. The burger was tasty and the lobster poutine was rich. I'd come back to try their other dishes."}
{"text":"Great food and near everything you need for shops. Every time I have been there it is quiet which is perfect so you can actually hear who you are with. Their burgers are delicious with their side salads. Definitely recommend."}
{"text":"For a buck a shuck, can you really go wrong? Amazing service, very knowledgeable about their dishes (explained our ceviche to a tee). Atmosphere is nice - ranges from bar seating and modern restaurant, to a casual dining room depending on where you sit. The oysters and ceviche tasted fresh, while my buddy's steak frites looked too tempting. They messed up our bill (did not split it properly) but they were patient and the issue was resolved. Would recommend!"}
{"text":"The food was amazing and so was the service! Love what they did with the place. Cute little venue!"}
{"text":"I've heard a lot about this place, but I was sort of disappointed. I got the Wilcox burger, and my friend got the Beets salad. 
My burger was pretty mediocore, and her salad was only on half of her plate. Literally. The presentation was awful, and it didn't even taste that good. 
I also had their okay but first coffee cocktail. Coffee? Great. Vodka? Great. Mix them together? Eh. Maybe some people might like it, but not me. 

I think you can already tell that I won't go back. Hah"}
{"text":"I came here for one of my friend's birthday lunch and had a splendid time! 
I forgot what the name of the dish was, but it was a skirt steak with a type of pesto sauce served with fries. I have to admit, I did find the steak a little hard to chew on but overall the meals that everyone had at my table were delicious. 
The server was nice and was very helpful when we wanted to switch our seating locations :)"}
{"text":"The Wilcox is a great spot for a classy-casual meal with friends. My group of four came here for a weekday lunch and experienced friendly service, no wait time, and pretty good food. I tried the soft-shell crab burger which was smaller than I had expected (especially for $21), although quite tasty and flavourful. The buns were soft and the crab was fried just right. Overall I enjoyed my meal, but wish I got more food for my dollar to fill me up."}
{"text":"Good menu
Fast service and friendly service 
We love steak tartare duck Korean lasagna 
And u should continue 
Nice ambient and staff"}
{"text":"1. Music is amazing ! Keep the old school rnb up!
2. Lobster poutine amazing but slightly salty 
3. Chicken wings were kinda small but tasty
4. Oysters were amazing. Must have when they're cheap 
5. Environment was cool. Cute waitresses"}
{"text":"We have been here at least ten times. It was me and the wife's go-to spot for date nights. On the first few visits, i was enthusiastic about the place and would have easily given it a 4. However, i have discovered there's a lot to dislike. 

First up, their hours suck. Bars that close by midnight are a huge pet peeve of mine. 

Secondly, the specials suck. They have an oyster night on Tuesday and Wednesday but the rest of the week has nothing worthwhile, and they've done away with taco night. 

Thirdly, the menu is way too expensive and food is way too small. Nothing proves my point faster than mistakenly ordering their spicy sriracha chicken wings and receiving 6 tiny wings for $14. It actually straight up angered me - and this problem is pretty much the same across the board.. Menu also needs updating and is incredibly stale. No charcuterie and cheese board anymore also highly disappointing 

Oh, and the last time i ordered their steak frites the steak looked BOILED instead of grilled, and was chewy as shoe leather 

Beer selection not updated often and not overly interesting. 

Now we would choose Earls or Bier Markt over a return to Wilcox because the value just isn't there unfortunately 

PS - the bar music playlist makes me want to stab my eardrums. It seems to contain only Justin Bieber songs and badly autotuned rap music, it's remarkable really


-----------------

Edit - thank you for following up I just read the managements comments..  

Not sure about the convoluted wing process but they were of average size and flavor and just very very disappointing..  Honestly if it were served with another component it might not seem like such a poor value..  Even veggie sticks and homemade dip would have helped, and cost you nothing.  They are definitely not 6 per lb count sized wings I am sorry, not sure who told you that

As far as the beer selection goes, the menu is often outdated or out of several beers. On last visit there was no Smashbomb Atomic, no Spearhead Hawaiian, and no new beers since our first visit..  There was a nice hibiscus beer priced at $10 a bottle

Squid ink pasta and squids from Spain don't really scream 'seasonal and local' to me but I do appreciate that you are adding new items to the menu..  That will help a lot

Lastly, why are the drinks never discounted or appetizers on sale?  I don't understand your strategy -- if you don't have the traffic to stay open later on most week nights, why not make specials that will bring people in?

Wing night.  Half priced apps night. Half priced wine bottles night. $5 craft pints.   Honestly, you should just hire me as a consultant to whip this place into shape. I accept ganja and scotch whiskey as forms of payment. 

I would change a lot of things but even things like this would renew interest in the pub for me..  It seems simple.  Look at Moxies, they've got great weekday specials and so does Earls..  No reason you guys can't too?

We will be back to give it another try.  Thank you

PS - Rebecca and Taylor are your best servers"}
{"text":"The look of this place compared to it's predecessor(Scruffy's) blew my mind. A job well done incorporating modern decor with the look of the heritage building. I tried the scotch egg, the bang bang tiger shrimp and the Wilcox burger and they did not disappoint. The scotch egg was a first for me and i will be definitely ordering it again. the shrimp was accompanied by a sauce that had quite a kick which i loved (beware if you can't handle any spice) The burger was well cooked and who could go wrong with an egg on top. the cocktails were well made and it was interesting to watch the bartender at work(I recommend the old fashioned). Over all the service was reminiscent of a quality downtown Toronto joint in Mississauga. which i think is exactly what Mississauga needs. I'll definitely be going back to try more dishes!"}
{"text":"Went here twice now.

First time was ok...ordered steak frites and fish tacos. Thought the tacos were a little pricey for what they are. Steak frites was average.

Wanted to try the place again to see how other menu items were. Had the wings and burger next time and the experience was much better too! Service was also good! Add happy hour to the mix and I'd recommend this place!"}
{"text":"The atmosphere here is good but the food was mediocre. I ordered the fish tacos...not that great here. If you want good food go eslewhere. If you want a good night out in Mississauga and don't want to hang out with underage kids at &Co then come here."}
{"text":"I recently had a friend visiting from Edmonton, AB who was doing some work in Mississauga. While I work in Toronto I thought I could meet him for dinner and show him a \"cool\" restaurant while he was in town. Boy, am I glad I picked this place!

The exterior is amazing - almost like going to your coolest friends house. Funny to see this kind of place in an area of office buildings! Alas, I loved it. Bit of a rustic industrial type feeling. 

The interior is just as great - with cool rustic decor, wood, metal, chandeliers and all sorts of other fun items. We were sat upstairs - it had almost a loft type feel which I thought was pretty cool. I wondered about the space in this place before we got in and having the space upstairs made it roomy! 

Our waitress was friendly and informative - suggesting that we share some appetizers (my favourite thing to do in order to try lots of things!) We ordered the nachos, fish tacos, and wings. While we sipped our beer and conversed - our food came out really quickly! 

Nachos were interesting and yummy - bbq sauce on nachos!? I was a huge fan. Just enough toppings and cheese to make it all come together. The fish tacos were flavourful and a great size for sharing (3 tacos), we devoured them! The wings were my favourite by far - they had almost a smokey flavour and a little bit of a kick. I will definitely be getting many more orders next time!

Overall, very inviting atmosphere for a drink and a night out. I'll be returning to try more items off of the menu!

PS. I also need to mentioned that I actually left my wallet at the Wilcox after I went home to Hamilton for the night. AH! I panicked and in the morning I called and our waitress had put it aside for me. THANK YOU AMAZING STAFF for keeping my wallet safe!"}
{"text":"A huge face lift from what it used to be. Decor is modern and warming - great for catching up with friends. I always get the Scotch egg - spicy tomato jam has some good kick to it. Love coming here on Tuesday's - cannot go wrong with buck-a-shuck oysters. Steak and frites - never disappoints, portion quite large. Their catch of the day special is refreshing - almond crusted fish with garlic kale and roasted potatoes. Creme brulee is my favvvv dessert. They're menu changes every few months - keeps you wanting to come back to try out the new features.

Wait staff extremely friendly. Cocktails are refreshing."}
{"text":"What can I say, it was like night and day between my first visit and my next.  
How i raved about the burger and service, etc

This last time, the service wasn't great, was very very slow.  In fact i was about to leave.  Why? We ordered the korean lasagna, and taco's.  Now it wasn't busy when we came, but it took no lie 45 minutes for our food to come.  In fact for twenty minutes we didn't see our server.  I litterly told my friend that if we don't see our food in 5 minutes we are leaving  the food showed up with one minute to go.  

No explanation, no anything.  In fact no drink refills, or checking up.  We actually had a table order a meal finish it and get the check.  before we got our food.

Now as I said, it was night and day.   I may go again only because I enjoyed my first trip.  But service for me is a big thing at places I go. 

(yes the korean lasagna was good, but for the price the portion was small and the wait was not worth it)"}
{"text":"This restaurant appears to reside in a renovated house. It is on the smaller side and can be a bit noisy, but it has a modern, rustic feel (antlers on light fixtures). The food is exceptional, and I do not say that lightly. They can make types of food you don't even like taste good because the balance of their flavours is so good! Things we love: the Scotch egg, the fish tacos, and the Canadian and Wilcox burgers. I think the Canadian might have a slight edge on the Wilcox because it is such a unique and flavourful burger, but the goat cheese on the Wilcox is a huge selling point for me as well. I was slightly less keen on the mac and cheese, though it may have been more complex with the bacon (I'm not a huge fan of meat, but their food is so balanced, I probably should have tried it that way. The chicken fettuchini was not what I was expecting when I ordered it (it is more of a tomato sauce than a rose), but our server was great and helped me get something else. Also, the service is great all around. Really helpful in making suggestions about what's good. We're looking forward to returning for Taco Mondays!"}
{"text":"Would be better if they enforced the law and prevented people from smoking on the patio, food was great burgers are among the best in the city"}
{"text":"Just here last night and the service was defs not on par than my previous experience. Actually, service was pretty non-existent. We had 3 different servers in the two hour span we were there and they would barely come around. Our last server was the bartender?? Who was tending to a full bar. I don't know how they expect him to run the whole show.

The food took FOREVER to come out. My gf and I were heavy in conversation the whole time but I could still tell it was taking so long. My gf got the fish tacos and I got the braised short ribs. My friend really liked the fish tacos and I'm sad I didn't just stick with that. I had asked to sub my rapini for some other green but the server said the kitchen was very limited and that's all they had. The beef was ok and pretty tender. I wasn't a fan of the polenta and I forced myself to eat the rapini. The gravy helped. I basically just ate the meat and some rapini and left the rest. We also originally wanted to get the beignets for dessert but they ran out?? Aren't they made to order? Isn't it just like dough? Anyways, we decided on the churros instead. They were not great and wouldn't get it again. They were pretty hard. Not like the soft fresh dough you're used to when they're super fresh. The water also tasted weird. I had to stop drinking it.

Next time I come, if I do, I will stick with the fish tacos."}
{"text":"#TheWilcox Gastropub!! What can I say about this place. It's up and coming for sure. This place was a ran down Irish Pub that evolved to a modern and elegant Gastropub. Once I stood outside, I thought this place looks great! When I stepped inside, I thought OMG even better. The decor was quite appealing and the fact that it was one of the oldest buildings in Mississauga made it more unbelievable. 

On to the consumables!! The drinks were very unique. I had such a variety that I forgot what I was drinking all night (As usual). Some drinks were mixed with bourbon, gin, and other various spirits. They had a wide selection of beer as well. As for the food, it was amazing. The creativity was incredible. No wonder the head chef, Humberto Sanchez was on Chopped Kitchen Canada. The service was great for a Yelp Elite Event. Those things get wild I tell ya. If I remember correctly Rebecca was my favorite server. We had a connection, at least I like to think. Haha! Those beautiful long legs...toned thighs... uhh wait we are talking about the food still right? Yeahhhh so I had the pleasure of trying many dishes. I had The Scotch Egg, Grouper Ceviche, Pulpo, there was a dish that consisted of mushrooms on a cracker, and there was a roasted pork sample that was to kill for. I would come back just for that roasted pork. Roasted Pork everything!! Must be the Asian in me. I would definitely return here, its just a shame that it is so far away from Richmond Hill. If you are in the area I recommend trying it out, you will not be disappointed. Until next time, JimStar Out!!"}
{"text":"Went for a party last night......upper area was reserved for the party.....nice area for a small gathering. Lots of great apps were served but nothing vegan or gluten free so I didn't eat anything. I probably would not go back on my own unless I verify if there is food I can eat. Didn't stay long enough to see the rest of the place. Free parking."}
{"text":"I had a business lunch here which was a nice venue and able to accommodate a large party of 7. It has a nice, modern feel to it, and isn't overly loud. For a gastropub, it definitely feels more like a restaurant than a bar/pub. 

Chicken Wings ($13) - Slightly dry and they felt like they had been under the food heater for a while. Didn't really love this. There were 5 small wings I believe.

Bang Bang Shrimp ($13) - Coconut and panko coated and deep fried. They were pretty good, but pretty standard. Nevertheless, I liked these and would get them again.

Lobster Poutine ($17) - I think the fries ate all the pieces of lobster because I kept wondering where the lobster was. It was tasty and the fries were good, but don't expect big pieces of lobster (if any at all)

 Yellowfin Tuna Salad ($18) - I was expecting more greens, more salad, so was a little bit disappointed that this was more like 5 thin slices of tuna and a lot of shredded cabbage with too much sriracha sauce. If you don't like spicy food, stay away from this dish, it's not for the sensitive. Don't think I would order this dish or recommend it, I've had better salads. 

Overall, nothing was truly offensive but nothing was  quite outstanding either. I don't think I would go out of my way to come here again."}
{"text":"@THEWILCOX #THEWILCOX #INSAUGA #BRUNCH #GASTROPUB #YELPGTA

You want a semi-fancy, hipster, Downtown Toronto like spot in Mississauga to hang out with a cooler group of friends or a date? This is it. I have been here for drinks and I have been here for brunch, and I could not recommend a place more. 

The exterior of this place looks like an unassuming house, and the interior has a living room, an indoor patio and a few storeys, all for your dining experience. My favorite spot is right under the skylight (indoor patio and bar) on a lovely evening or a sunny brunch. Tufted, comfortable seats and rustic tables - I quite like the decor. 

The drinks have always been pleasant. I've tried the following: 
- Mimosas for brunch (yum)
- Caesars for brunch (yum)
- Somersby Berry Cider (rarely available anywhere else). I am hardly offended by the fact that Wilcox charges me $7 more than LCBO does for this exact can. 
- No margarita rating yet! Sorry! 

I've tried the Mother's Day Brunch special menu at Wilcox. I tried the Blueberry pancakes entree with churros for dessert, and as basic as that might sound, it was absolutely exquisite. 

A shout out to The Wilcox Gastropub for maintaining a great online (website and Instagram) presence! The webiste is clean and gorgeous, as is the branding. It shows off a bit of what Wilcox is really all about (that skylight)! 

Ankie Tip: You can make reservations via Open Table right off of their website. Easy Peasy."}
{"text":"Stopped in with a friend to try some new eats and had a pleasant experience from this tapas experience 

Ambiance warm though the rustic old house is old school cavernous they've nestled some cozy sectional atmosphere to warm it up 

Great selection of cocktails and numerous negronis for my liking 

The Tuna kimchi croquettes were notably enjoyable - perfectly made and powerfully flavourful 

The wings were regular fare though I enjoyed the piri piri seasoning 

The fried chicken and cornbread was a magnitude of flavour and value that is sure to be a crowd pleaser - butter is good and honey is better we found - but know that it's a moist chicken that we were assured hit the approved temperatures 

The pork and squid was a hit of flavours that had traditional Korean notes - though the skin on the pork was a bit thick it complimented the fat and a negligible element to otherwise nice offering

I'd happily revisit this resto soon as a local gastropub I suggest you drop in to see what creations they've reimagined"}
{"text":"Cool little pub in the heart of Mississauga.   A bit quiet for a Saturday afternoon, was kind of worried before we ordered, but I shouldn't have.    You have to order the fish tacos!   They were amazing.   And the chicken sandwich had a little zing that was awesome.   I will be back!"}
{"text":"I've been to the Wilcox several times with various friends. Although it's busy and noisy most of the times, I've had a great time every time. Some of my fave dishes are lobster poutine, pork belly & baby octopus, mahi-mahi tacos, kimchi croquettes, salmon crudo (I love seafood & fish!) and the Wilcox burger. The flavour combinations are unique, unexpected and delicious! The daily features are awesome too, especially $1 oysters on Tuesday & Wednesday."}
{"text":"Met some of my girlies here for a little gal's night out. Pretty cute place. Nicely decorated & good ambience. The drinks were flowing and the conversation was great, so perhaps I'm a bit biased.

I had the Yellowfin Tuna Salad. It was good. $19 good? No. The tuna was sliced very thinly and the salad was a basic coleslaw mix with edamame tossed in. My friend's meals looked pretty amazing though. I was BIG TIME jealous of their multiple orders of Lobster Poutine. Next time. 

Was also eyeing up that Korean Lasagna and the Crab Burger for next time too. 

Be sure to check out these little gems:
- $1 oysters on Tuesday & Wednesday
- $5 Hennessy & Grey Goose on Thursday (among others, but those were the highlights for me)"}
{"text":"Have been here twice now and although I loved it the first time, the second time was a little more iffy. Here's the deal: The first time I came a few months ago, I ordered the southern fried chicken dish and it was amazing. Delicious chicken, sweet cornbread, and very generous portions. Was raring to go back.

On my most recent visit my guest got the chicken and I (even though I was dying to get it again as well, I wanted to branch out) got the braised short ribs. My ribs were good. It was a well executed dish and while I don't personally love the bitter rapini, the meat was very tender and the portions were quite big.

My friend who ordered the chicken, however, was not so lucky. It came out super salty (both of us had a piece and agreed on this). We asked the waitress if she'd look into it and she had the kitchen check it out right away (service really is great here). Unfortunately they couldn't make new chicken. My guess is the seasoning was off for the whole batch. We didn't have time to wait for another new dish either so unfortunately we had to leave. The chicken was of course removed from the bill.

Here's hoping the salty poulet was just a fluke because I really want to go back again. There's just so many other delicious-looking things on the menu!"}
{"text":"One of my Favourite spots in Mississauga to dine with friends and take clients for a great dining experience. Thoroughly enjoy the Lobster Poutine, Steak and Frites & the Tuna Salad! Gah, now I'm hungry."}
{"text":"I'm so delighted that the West End has finally welcomed a restaurant like this, you don't have to drive to Toronto for a hip venue with good food anymore! Conveniently located near Square One and right off the 403, I came here on a snowy afternoon with my boyfriend.

As you enter the restaurant you feel like you're walking into a house, it's cozy but spacious at the same time because of the awesome roof/windows on the side of the building. This place is just interesting to look at in general, the dining room and lounge area have great light fixtures. I came here during the day, but can't imagine what it looks like in the evening when the place fills up with people grabbing a drink. 

Now for the food - to share we ordered the Bang Bang Shrimps, a Scotch Egg and Lobster Poutine. All of the apps were amazing but I would recommend the last two. The shrimp was good, but it came with little sauce (sweet chili Thai, nothing revolutionary) and a lot of tossed greens. I wouldn't order it again because you can find it elsewhere like at an AYCE sushi joint for example. The Scotch Egg and Lobster Poutine were so tasty and everything you'd imagine it to be. Eating the Scotch Egg made me feel like I was eating a giant pork meatball (who doesn't like that?) that was lightly fried to perfection on the outside. What made this dish go over the top was the light and sweet tomato based sauce that it was plated on, the acidity from it complimented the pork really well. Lastly, everything that you would expect in a Lobster Poutine is what you get at The Wilcox. Great fries, lots of cheese and large chunks of lobster smothered in a great Bearnaise sauce. 

For the main course, I ordered the Wilcox salad and my boyfriend ordered the Wilcox Burger with a house salad on the side (which was basically the Wilcox salad). I'd order the Wilcox burger again, they bake their buns in-house, the burger was seasoned nicely and it came with a perfectly cooked fried egg on top. The Wilcox salad was a disappointment, there was a component or two that was missing completely to make the salad whole. It came with apples that were sliced into tiny matchsticks, pickled onions and quinoa. Now, I'm not the type to complain about my food and send it back, it wasn't horrible, but when you eat a salad, you expect it to be GOOD because who likes eating salad, really? The attentive waiter noticed that I wasn't into it and was slowly picking at it, he was nice enough to offer me another salad of my choice. I'd recommend adding a protein component to the dish, maybe a cheese, some acidity (you can't taste the sweetness/tartness of the apple) and texture, like crispy quinoa instead of it being plainly cooked. To replace it, I got the Warm Spinach Salad with bacon and asiago. It wasn't warm, the candied bacon was plentiful. Like the last salad I had, it was missing something again! I know that the restaurant is relatively new, so hopefully when they improve or tweak their menu the salads will be revamped!

Despite the salad, I'd definitely come here again to try some drinks off of the impressive cocktail menu and the Chicken Pot Pie! I heard they have churros on their dessert menu as well. 

Kudos to the friendly and attentive staff at The Wilcox. Welcome to the neighbourhood!"}
{"text":"3.5 stars. Went here for the first time for a friends birthday. It was very quiet for a Sunday night and we had reservations. Took advantage of their happy hour from 3-7 and ordered some $6 beer and wine. 

My fiancé ordered the grilled duck leg confit while I tried the korean lasagna. The lasagna tasted good, the most different version I've ever had through their use of kimchi and fried wontons in lieu of pasta. The grilled duck leg confit was very flavourful as well and my fiancé enjoyed it. We finished off our meal with the churros which very good, different in the sense that the texture reminded me of a thicker cinnamon twist rather than the traditional churro. 

My only gripe with the Wilcox would have to be pricing. The food is good but for what you get I don't feel that the pricing is justified. If the portion sizes were slightly larger or the prices were reduced by about $5 I think it would make it much more worth it."}
{"text":"Opening and still working out the bugs. Was difficult to tell if it was open. Good was definitely a notch above typical pub fare. Duck confit. several versions. 
Good selection of local and not local drafts.  Service was well done. They want to please."}
{"text":"I was in Mississauga for something else, which meant it gave me an opportunity to eat in the area as well. I ended up eating at The Wilcox Gastropub and I ended up very happy.

Staff: We were greeted right away by a staff member. It was a rainy Easter Monday so it was pretty quiet and she was the only server/bartender. She was one of the best servers I've had in a long time and had the right balance of timing when it came to checking in on us without being intrusive. The server herself deserves five stars! The food came pretty quick too, so that's always a plus.

Ambience: It definitely had a hipster vibe with the music and the décor. I can't really explain it but I was digging the décor. They also had the television on with the news which I appreciated knowing the forecast and current events. Thumbs up on the surroundings!

Food: I had the Chicken Pot Pie and it was hearty and very filling. I loved the flaky top crust. There was plenty of filling with chicken, potatoes, bacon, mushrooms, etc. The only downside, and the only reason they lost a star from me, is the pearl onions. Don't get me wrong, I like onions as much as the next person. However, the pearl onions were only cut in halves and tossed in. I feel like they could've at least broken them up a bit more because there were too many large chunks of pearl onions.

There are many things on the menu I want to try again and this first experience definitely whet my appetite for more!"}
{"text":"Impressive renovation and overhaul of the old establishment with a tip of the hat to the heritage of the Wilcox family.  

Food is upscale, but not overly pretentious.  Guests in our party tried the bone marrow, nachos and ceviche for appy's, all great.  I crushed the bison burger and had to restrain myself from ordering a second.  Totally awesome.

Drinks are impressive, especially the vodka gimlet - rivals and outmatches many of the higher end NYC versions I have grown accustomed to.  

Service is top notch, very friendly, personable and attentive.  A couple of the managers, Joe and Cong, are the real deal, who came out to ensure our party of 10 was well taken care of.  But I also noticed they took the time to greet and ensure the table of 2 next to us were doing OK as well.  

Whenever we come home to visit TO, this is a always a mark on our hit list!"}
{"text":"like it like it like it! I'm so glad that there is such eclectic spot in central Mississauga for a date night or casual hangouts with friends. The service is always really good, and there's a fun menu of items to choose from. Love the ambience and live dj as well"}
{"text":"Great experience, very friendly staff, great interior design and beautiful spiralling staircase to add, you can tell that both the waiters and the chefs respect the establishment; it shows in both the great food and great customer service. Meals are both unique and tasty, great quality/quantity for your dollar. Would go again and I recommend the crab burger or the southern chicken dish."}
{"text":"Enjoyed a nice meal here on a Friday night, seated in the cute upper level. Service was prompt, friendly and knowledgeable.
Scotch egg - yum!
Steak tartare and roasted marrow - very good. A bit strong on the Dijon (personal preference) but the marrow helped mellow it out. 
Ponzu marinated steak - cooked as requested with nice flavour and presentation.
Fiduea - interesting twist with capellini and cod. 
Cocktails were also good. 

Note: flight of stairs and steps to resto may make accessibility an issue. Call to reserve /inquire in advance. 

We will return to try other dishes soon."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere and great service. The tacos were spot on and had a great flavour. The lobster poutine had a perfect richness and was well-seasoned although I would have liked something to cut the richness after a while, like some crisp pickled vegetables. The mac and cheese was delicious but could have used more cheese. Great place!!!"}
{"text":"My group of 3 went to The Wilcox referred by a friend.  We did the whole top to bottom menu order.  We ordered drinks which were really good.  Strong flavours and creative; only downside was that they did not have enough fruit juices on hand to make our original drinks order and we had to order something different.

For sharable, we ordered lobster poutine which was delicious.  The cream sauce did not overpower the lobster and the fries were lightly seasoned so it was not too salty.

Entries we ordered short ribs, crab pasta, korean lasagna.  None of us particularly loved the dishes but they were ok.  The korean lasagna was filling but we thought it would have some kimchi or spiciness; it turned out to have neither.  It was good flavour of sirracha and cheese with some lasagna and crispy wonton layered through.  The crab pasta was a sizeable portion and creamy.  Short ribs was pretty big, lots of veggies and short ribs.

Dessert we ordered the passion fruit chocolate torte which was huge.  

All in all, I think we enjoyed the drinks and dessert the most. It was great they did not rush us as we were there for almost 4 hours.  Also, place was not packed on a Saturday night at 8-9pm but I would still recommend reservation.  Would I go back?  Maybe"}
{"text":"The oysters here are fresh and delicious. Come early to avoid disappointment :) my favourite dish is their fish tacos."}
{"text":"Found this place on Yelp when roaming around and boy was I psyched! Killer atmosphere and the food is on point. Nice selection of beers too. Octopus/Pork Belly was amazing and loved the Scotch Egg too. Wish I had found it sooner, back to NYC tomorrow."}
{"text":"The ambiance here is nice but I would only come back for the drinks and the buck a shuck specials as I really disliked the food here. 

The only thing I liked from what we ordered was the bone marrow - however it's pretty hard to mess that up. 
The grilled octopus was overdone and tough. 
I was recommended the Asian salad slaw item and I only took a few bites - it was a weird mix of flavours and I really did not like it. The seared fish (I think it was tuna) was awful. Not fresh at all and nothing from the dish made up for it. 
We also got the chicken pot pie. Don't know why but it was more of a soup.. the pie filling was not only runny but also flavourless. We tried to add more salt but since the dish itself has no umami flavour, there was nothing we could do to save it."}
{"text":"Good location/architecture/decor. Unfortunate service and food.


Pros: Historic building. Stylish decor. Lots of parking

Cons: Food/drink/service was disappointing.



Lavendar drink tasted like perfume, didn't present as stated in menu, missing flower. Ordered the fresh handmade pasta, but noodles were not cooked, some strands soft some hard and stick together. Sent it back, waitress questioned my judgement of al dente...
Next one took so long to come my companion had finished his meal already.
At least they comped it but no apology from anyone, not manager nor waitress. And sadly when the second one finally arrived it had the wrong wine in the sauce and it tasted terrible. Didn't even bother this time around just gave up.

Sadly my dinner date also did not enjoy the sheppard's pie. We both agreed that for $18 it should not have what we both thought was frozen vegetables, and soggy potatoe on top.

Perhaps every other thing on the menu is good and we just got shit luck however, i 'd be reluctant to eat there again. Maybe drinks at the bar but not for dinner. Sadly. Was really hoping for a better experience.


Good location. Unfortunate service and food."}
{"text":"I've been to the Wilcox a couple times before and it's always been great but I haven't been in a few months. This review is based on my experience on September 23rd 2016.

I planned a surprise party for my friend. All together we had a part of 12. I made the reservations for 9:30 PM. We got there on time the table was ready it all seemed like it was off to a great start. Most of our group showed up before the friend we were supposed to surprise and the staff was really nice. All in all seemed good. 

We ordered drinks and food. I ordered the southern fried chicken and let me tell you it was BURNT! You can see in the photo that part of black. Worse then Popeyes worse then KFC and definitely more expensive! The corn bread was good but not good enough to hide the fact that my chicken was dry and burnt! I ordered a mojito and it was good but I've never really had a bad mojito it's a basic drink...

My friends Corona though was flat, not sure how a bottled beer got to our table so that that there was absolutely no bubbles in it even when shaken...

Remember large parties get 17% tip added on which isn't a big deal as it's pretty standard practice so I don't mind that. 

Lastly, for some reasons it annoys me when waitresses don't have a system to remember who ordered what and come around and ask everyone what they ordered. This annoys me because I've been places where waitresses have a system and then sometimes I go places where they totally don't. 


All in all I feel like I probably won't come back here and if I don't won't be for a long while as this experience left a sour taste in my mouth. I'm not sure how I was allowed to be served burnt chicken. The Wilcox you had so much potential and you were doing great. Hopefully this isn't the start of a downward spiral for the restaurant."}
{"text":"Yay finally got to go to The Wilcox. Love the decor, the layout and design was very nice and the vibe is super chill. Food was pretty good! Veal bone marrow, so fatty but so good! Fish tacos was tasty and the fish and chips was on point, not too battered perfect amount of batter n fish. I'd definitely go here again!"}
{"text":"The food was a little over-hyped for me but still pretty good. Our server on the other hand was outstanding! Strongly recommend this place as a higher class pub in Mississauga."}
{"text":"I was torn about this review 'cause this place has soo many things going for it:  cool vibe with various different types of atmosphere, attractive and helpful staff, a full-on drinks menu, appetising looking food, PARKING, what more could a 'burban girl ask for?

(I was also torn as I had such a fun time at the Yelp event that they hosted a few weeks back.)

Anyway, to be honest, their food lacks taste.  In fact, it's pretty tasteless.  Ordered Pulled Pork Poutine ($12) and there probably wasn't a pinch of salt in it.  I'm not a salt person, so when I say that there was no seasoning, there was no seasoning.  Cheese curds weren't squeaky as everything was already melted.  Gravy/pulled pork was just plopped on top of the fries, no layering.

We sat down before 7pm, but realised a coupla minutes afterwards that they had a special for $5 pitchers.  However, we weren't able to take advantage of it.  It was literally 7:02pm.  :(  Waitress didn't even ask, but just said \"No\" politely.  I think it would've been nice if she offered/faked asking.

Drink menu also lacked beer flights.  I was actually quite surprised by this.

Great place to grab a drink/quick bite after work with a coworker, but I wouldn't really expect too much from the food which is a shame because everything else is working in its favour...except the FLAVOUR!"}
{"text":"Rude bartender and extremely slow service.

Talks back to you when he makes your drink wrong."}
{"text":"Really good place with a very inviting restaurant vibe. Also has a variety of common and uncommon good choices."}
{"text":"The food and atmosphere is top shelf. The service is always great and the food gets to you at a decent clip. I highly recommend this place and know they won't disappoint. Hidden gem in Mississauga!"}
{"text":"This is a good place for trendy atmosphere and food. I ordered the ceviche which was made to perfection - the raw fish was marinated well in lime juice. The bone marrow pie was rich but not too heavy on the pastry. The malpeque oysters are very fresh, although on the smaller side.. but they have a $1 per oyster deal on Tuesdays and Wednesdays! Great place for a date. Their menu changes often, so lots to try!"}
{"text":"April 2 2017. Had a marvellous dinner  so scrumptious!  Got the braised ribs served on polenta with rapini. The beef tasted like beef not garlic as so many restaurants drown out the flavour of beef with garlic!. So rich and buttery and melted right off the bone. It was a large amount for me well worth the money. I had to share with my husband!  The polenta was a little more \"loose\" than I'm used to but still full of buttery flavour and the rapini was cooked to perfection with no bitter taste at all. I very much enjoyed the meal. For appetizers we had Thai shrimp and hot wings. The shrimp were very spicy which I'm not used to. Just a bit too much heat for me but the wings were manageable. Both were delicious!  Well worth the price and I would recommend this restaurant because of the simplicity of the meal yet full dynamite flavour. Again you tasted what you were eating not what the chef thinks should be sprinkled in it. Very good beef!  My only complaint was our waitress. Although very polite she would quickly run off without checking if anybody needed anything. I will assume she was new and inexperienced. When one of my friends ordered water she left the table and got it without asking if anybody else would like something to drink. Oh well nothing too critical. Next time I'm in Mississauga I will stop by again. Also the decor was very nice and modern. Well planned out table arrangements. Thank you!  I would give you 4.5 stars if it wasn't for the waitress."}
{"text":"Came here on a Tuesday for the oysters. The oysters were not fresh. I guess that's why they are a dollar."}
{"text":"Great food. Great service. Jay was an awesome bartender - old fashions were amazing! Everyone was Friendly and welcoming. Kahn and Sierra were also very cordial (sorry if I misspelled your names). I just stopped in for a burger and a drink and it turned into a full night of great times. Rest assured on my next trip back to Mississauga I will be back, no doubt! Thanks guys!"}
{"text":"Was there tonight. I had the Wilcox Burger - nothing special other than the fried onions on top were a nice touch. The chuck (ground beef) lacked flavor and juiciness. Overall the burger had no distinct taste other than the cheese that's added to it. 

The patio was really nice with gorgeous flame heat lamps and ambience.  Didn't feel like you were in Mississauga. 

My friend had the chicken pot pie ($14) and said it was the best he'd ever had. My other friend had the fettuccine with chicken ($18) - the pasta was made fresh in house. Had to ask the female server to bring out fresh pepper for the pasta and ketchup for my fries. Otherwise she tried hard and was attentive. 

I'd go back to have drinks on the patio but not for food necessarily."}
{"text":"Everything is amazing. Even the music! Few places in sauga with hip hop and popular music! The food..... is life!"}
{"text":"keep it coming :) !!! 

I love this place, the atmosphere, the food and flavours the service!.

This is a great place to get together after work for dinner or even just a date night with the partner of choice.

I am always seated upstairs which is a lot brighter and better for interaction with the people you are with. The lighting is intimate during dinner dim yet enough to see where you are going and what you are eating. 

The food is always cooked properly for me, I ordered the steak and fries and it was amazing ! cooked to a medium delightfulness the was juicy and tender, and none the less flavourful.

I have also tried the coconut shrimp which was also cooked with love, flavour burst with every bite and not to mention the kick from the sweet spicy chili Thai sauce that it was served with.

overall, I enjoyed this place the both times I have been and will be going back there sometime soon with come coworkers so I can't wait to see what over things I can try."}
{"text":"I came here for my boyfriends birthday on Saturday. I reserved for 40 people a month in advance with a lack of timely confirmation that I was told I would get through a phone call. Called twice for confirmation so I could set plans in stone, and the manager who helped me out was nice, helpful and informative so that made up for it.

Once we arrived the day of there was some misconfusion regarding the seating but Jo and the hostess were amazing at providing clarification. Throughout the night the two servers were great!! Such kind girls. Fast service, good food, and my whole group loved the dishes that were ordered. To top it all of the MUSIC on Saturdays is perfect for the mood and setting. Old rnb/hip hop to modern rnb/hip hop to reggaeton and bachata. They played a lot of songs you never really hear at a bar and my group loved it. 

Soooo happy that I came here for my boyfriends birthday. Will be coming back in the future for another birthday and will recommend to everyone!
Thank you Wilcox!"}
{"text":"If you want to impress, this is definitely the place. The indoor venue looks lovely, very warm with lots of open lighting. We ate outside on the patio because the weather was super nice. 

I ordered the Mac and cheese while my friends got two different salads. While the flavors were awesome, we all thought that lunch was pretty expensive, even for the basic salads.

I think this place is nice, but in the bougie side so it's a once in a while for me."}
{"text":"Pretty upsetting and disappointing first experience. Took 20 minutes for a loaf of bread to come out,  which was burnt and barely edible. The Scotch egg we ordered was definitely left at the pass for way too long. It was luke warm at best when it arrived at our table. 

Another 20 minute wait after that for our mains. The steak frites while cooked quite nicely, was cold. As well, how does a restaurant justify charging $30+ for 2 tiny pieces of short rib with undercooked potatoes!!?? 

I would not recommend this restaurant to anyone and definitely will not be coming back."}
{"text":"Very nice decore. We were a party of 10 . Food was below average. Fried chicken wasn't fully cooked. Presentation was nice. Also larger parties get automatic 17% gratuity added. What's the recourse for bad service?"}
{"text":"This location has been a revolving door the past few years, so I'm glad to finally come to a place that i think might stick around. The food here is really good - by far one of the best chicken pot pies I've ever had. The viet wings and scotch egg are a must have - and the scallops with mango salsa and quinoa was really tasty. The restaurant can get a little loud because of the layout but overall the atmosphere is great. Really solid overall. 4.5./5"}
{"text":"came back for drinks..ended up getting steak frites which were so good i cannot wait to come back and have it again. our waitress was super nice and she even told us about their weekly specials as we were leaving. i didnt know they had them! monday is taco night and theres two oyster nights apparently! anyways great local place for mississauga"}
{"text":"Went here last night to check it out with a friend. It is the type of resto Mississauga has needed for a while now! Hip, well designed and an overall vibe that doesn't scream suburbia. Loved the $1 oysters and Poutine. The sever was very nice, attentive and timely. Loved it and hope they do well. Can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"I had high hopes. I tried the tacos those I give a 5/5 by itself they were so delish. I also tried the lobster pontine with two pieces of lobster in it but the cheese was so delish that I loved it anyway but considering the price I paid a lot to eat a poutine. I the. Got the California burger I liked it had to much mayo on it not enough pico de galo. Also very greasy oil was soaking through my bottom bun and was mushy. My bf got the Wilcox burger and his bottom bun just deteriorated after a few bites from all the oil and grease of the egg and the burger. Mind you the meat was super tasty cooked perfectly just super greasy. I might come back or I might not and just try something else.... Oh and the decor was nice and I liked the music a lot"}
{"text":"One of my favourite restaurants in Mississauga! Great atmosphere, good service and menu items are delicious. Great restaurant to catch up and relax with friends and it's also a great spot for date nights!

Service and Environment
It's a casual environment with good music and a welcoming fun atmosphere. Servers know their menu items very well and are always good help. They do tend to get busy during the evenings so wait time varies. 

Food
I've been here quite a few times but here's a rundown of some of my favourite menu items:
Fish Tacos - Tastes fresh and is very flavourful and zesty! 
The Wilcox Burger - A really juicy burger topped off with a runny fried egg in the centre, yummm. 

Some other menu items that I think are okay:
Steak and Frites - Steak was cooked well - very tender and moist. However I think they put too much of their pesto sauce on the steak. 

Bone Marrow - It was our first time trying bone marrow and I'm not really sure how to rate it without having any prior taste knowledge to compare it to. I personally didn't enjoy it but it was more of the texture than the flavour hence I think bone marrow itself isn't for me. The server did mention that it was one of their popular menu items."}
{"text":"I've been here a few times and enjoyed whatever? the menu threw at me. My most memorable plate was the Chicken Pot Pie. The service is friendly and most?ly efficent. It gets busy and you cant fault them for that! great little spot. I'd say it were a hidden gem, but i think its more of a neighbourhood staple!"}
{"text":"It an awesome place to eat at.  Good food and service and good looking girls for all the guys out there wink* so when your all free go try it.. ( Mac n Cheese)  (Lobster Poutine)"}
{"text":"This restaurant follows a quality-over-quantity type of philosophy. Located in the central heart of Mississauga, The Wilcox Gastropub resembles a restored-warehouse space with a touch of sophistication. 

My friends and I decided to give this place a try on a Friday night. Unfortunately we did not make reservations but were fortunately seated very quickly for this matter.  

The food definitely left a memorable mark on our palettes! We ordered appetizers to share among a group of four girls; Wilcox Poutine, Nachos, Fish Tacos and Tiger Shrimps. All dishes were extremely delicious, I could not pin-point any negative flaws. 

Staff were very friendly, attentive and well-mannered. 

Needless to say, I will definitely be visiting this place again!"}
{"text":"The Wilcox is a place with unique cocktails, entrees and tapas! My buddy took me to this place during the holidays and I really enjoyed everything. This time when I came back from New York with my boy friend to visit, I chose this place to host and go back to! They were great and accommodated us with a reservation the morning of. The owner there was nice and gave us a round of shots as well!"}
{"text":"Excellent Place, trendy, good Food and Great Service. Went there on a Saturday Evening, it wasn't busy at all, probably because it's still fairly new though."}
{"text":"Came here again about 5 days ago and I forgot to review! I am officially a regular here, I Love the food and Drinks and desserts! I got the fish tacos agaaain.. haha, I really like them I guess. Smiley face! I had Mill St. Organic beer, it's one of my personal favorites and just sat down and chatted with a friend for 2 hours while having drinks. The bartender lady there is awesome!! The third floor was completely empty and looked closed and we asked if we can sit up there and she said Absolutely! Turned on the lights for us and made sure to come up every 15min to make sure we were good. I got the lobster Mac and Cheese take out for my mom since I left to go meet up with her. I haven't tasted it personally but she said it was okay and that she's had better and there wasn't enough Lobster in it. I probably would have liked it more (my mom is a picky eater). I'm not going to take her word for it though.. when I took it to go, it was in a decent portion size and was warm and seemed to be good.. I wasn't expecting the portion to be as big but hey, even better EH! I'm going to try it next time.. lol"}
{"text":"good apps. pleasant venue.
all pasta dishes were bland, dry and lacked flavour not just salt. Steak ordered medium was served well done. cornbread was dry. dessert was served as a \"sharable\" to a work party of 30. one bowl, two forks for each \"couple\" with no extra plates. I like people I work with but I certainly do not want to eat off the same plate! waitresses were attentive except for one who preferred to argue with us rather than rectify the problem. 
managers/owners? took no responsibility."}
{"text":"Spent me and my girlfriend's 6 month-a-versary here. Got the Tandoori lamb shank, Korean Lasagna, Lobster Poutine, and Churros. Good food, good service, good atmosphere. Food a bit pricy for the portion but the ambiance and service makes it worth it. Though not overly more pricey. Just a bit more expensive than Jack Astor's or Moxies and of course there is more emphasis on the food quality here."}
{"text":"This is my second time at Wilcox and it didn't disappoint. The waiter was attentive, helpful and had a sense of humour which was nice. It was my birthday lunch with my great friends and I couldn't be happier. We were seated near the entrance which separates the other sitting area, so it felt we had the entire space!!

Happy:  5 friends all order their lunch burger with fries or salad. They were all happy and gulped it down. The pomegranate salad was bigger than I thought for a side, so I would like to try that out next time. The fish tacos was colourful and appetizing. I had the pan roasted quail which was nicely presented. There were more red cabbage portion than the roasted potato wedges which I would have like a few more pieces. 

To end of the meal, I shared the Alaskan dessert (see photo below) and how the waiter described it, one must wonder and try it out!! And for only $6, it's truly affordable and one of the cheapest items on their menu!!! Each layer revealed a new surprise as you have to finish half of it to get to the small portion of the vanilla ice cream which is really tucked inside. A new surprise and treat for me!! 

Not happy:  Believe it or not, nothing that I can think of. The food came in at a reasonable time. The service was great. He didn't forget anything that we asked for (e.g. napkins, water, ketchup).

Verdict:  You will walk out there happy and pleased that you had some amazing food. I would definitely go back for another special occasion. Or just because I want to try other dishes from their menu!! Honestly, you have to try it!!"}
{"text":"I am blessed that I get to travel for work. I use Yelp each week I am on the road and most of the times it's spot on. Well this one was one of the best. Read the reviews, looked over the menu and decided to give The Wilcox a try. So glad that I did. Great menu, great execution and John the Bartender was awesome. I always love when I see one of the owners clearing tables and rolling his sleeves up and helping out. Great job team! Shared apps with my coworker, Steak Tartare, Kimchi Croquettes, Scotch Egg and Confit Wings. Each dish was fantastic. Hope I get to travel to Mississauga again."}
{"text":"I had to conduct some after work interviews and the hostess and waitress teams were amazing in helping me facilitate. They didn't chase me out as we lingered a little bit and were so nice. I then ordered the fish tacos, (my waitress's recommendation) which seriously were the best I've ever had. So juicy and the toppings were to die for. This place is so cute. I will be back for sure!"}
{"text":"Had been meaning to visit forever...finally had an opportunity on my mother+daughter date night. As many Yelpers have already mentioned, The Wilcox is situated in a stunning building, both inside and out.

When we entered the very friendly hostess asked where we would have liked to be seated. I asked where ever she recommended. She recommended the lounge, so happy she did. We had a fantastic view of the kitchen and bar area.

Our waitress was fantastic, she answered my hundreds of questions and allowed us to eat and soak up the sights, sounds and smells at our leisure. I found it so amazing that the kitchen, at the size it is, is able to turn out the quality and quantity it does. It's like the size of a food truck, but with 10x the menu items...crazy!!!

From our drinks, to the environment to the food...Such a FANTASTIC experience. I mentioned to the server we were celebrating something...my excuse for having dessert, they ended up comping one of our desserts!!! What fantastic service.

We will definitely be back...very very soon and very very often."}
{"text":"I got the pulled pork poutine here and was kind of disappointed. It didn't have that sweet tangy taste usually associated with pulled pork and everything in the menu seemed kind of pricey.   The service was very good though and they've  created a very hip atmosphere. I think the waitress  may have refilled my water a half dozen times that night!"}
{"text":"So bomb.
Came back for buck a shuck and got the steak and frites and the catch of the day (salmon teriyaki).

Steak and frites was so good. I practically inhaled it. The chimichurri was the perfect amount of tang and bite.

The salmon had a great sear, smokey full flavor from the grill.

Everything was seasoned perfect and service was stellar."}
{"text":"WHAT TO TRY?

The crab burger! Stacked with a fried whole soft crab ,  you want to try it's crisp and tender juicy meat in this burger. I've never had soft crab presenter to me as a whole. Places usually just cut it up or just give me the legs in spider rolls or a dish of just soft shell crab so it's nice to try something different. 

WHAT NOT TO TRY?

I didn't think the desserts we had was anything special. The vanilla ice cream for the ice cream with brioche was still iced when it was presented to us and the churros didn't have a great plating presentation when it was presented to us. The pork could have been done better in the pork belly and octopus appetizer. The pork skin wasn't crispy enough and they didn't grill it enough to have a nice bronze colour of the skin you want to salivate to. 

LAST TIP?

You can go here during lunch and dinner but the menu would be the same. Usually lunches elsewhere would be cheaper but in this restaurant, since it's the same menu for both lunch and dinner, it can be quite expensive to have a lunch here so I recommend everyone to come here for dinners instead."}
{"text":"Been here quite a few times for dinner and the only thing I ALWAYS rave about to people are about the fish tacos. They changed the menu recently (could be a seasonal thing because all the things I used to order aren't there anymore). For the fish tacos, the fish from last year was replaced by mahi mahi. It was my first time trying this fish do I didn't know what to expect from it. The fish tasted a little bit dry but generally as a whole, the taco tastes great. I had a party of 5 and 4 out of them ordered a set of tacos for themselves. 
I ordered the laksa Singapore noodle and it was alright. The soup was more lemony then I expected and doesn't have enough coconut. Wasn't a big fan of the type of tofu they used. There were three large shrimp pieces and these were good. I've had more legit laksa before and this doesn't cut it. 
Tuesday has $1 oysters. I'm not a seafood fan but my friends loved it and kept ordering more because they tasted that good."}
{"text":"I started with their fish tacos and I got their chicken burger. I liked their food (especially fries) but it was a little pricey. Service was good but the food took longer than expected to come."}
{"text":"I came here cause it had good ratings and the building looks cool. Very expensive and small portions. Don't order salad there cause there isn't any with lettuce."}
{"text":"Love the look of this place. Unexpectedly it was relatively quiet for a Friday dinner. Everyone in our party of 6 very much enjoyed what they ordered, with the burgers being a stand out. The only thing holding this back from being 5 stars is the nachos that we ordered to share. For $20 ($15 + $5 for chicken), I felt the nachos were a real disappointment. Would definitely go back."}
{"text":"I have been to the Wilcox a few times for lunch / dinner or drinks and typically the food is good and cocktails very well made. I will say depending on the bartender the cocktails go from average to excellent, considering the cost of the drinks I expect them always to excellent. Meals are also hit and miss, sometimes they are well prepared and flavorful...other times they are over slated and fail to impress me. For a gastro pub the menu is fairly static and wine selections are limited. We had a DJ one evening with cocktails that was excellent and made the whole experience worthwhile for a repeat visit again."}
{"text":"The renovations at this place (from when it was Scruffy's) are quite certainly noticeable! The place looks classy and the interior decor is great. The food has always been great and service is good. The lounge area (bottom section) is a little small but  comfortable. There are drink deals (a happy hour) between 3 and 7pm so if you're into that, get there early. Anything from glasses of scotch to wine or craft beer on special. The lobster poutine is good, and the southern fried chicken is also good. The burgers are also very tasty and fresh. The menu, however, keeps changing. There used to be an oyster special ($1/oyster) some days of the week, but I forget which.... all around a great place to meet with friends!"}
{"text":"Joint keeps going downhill. Owners regularly close the place for private events or when they feel like it without so much as a sign on the door let alone an update to their website or SM. Last time I went to catch the end of the Jay's game with a friend who lives nearby, 12 empty tables and a clueless hostess saying the whole place was reserved. CP24 on every TV instead of the game, no attempt to get us into a table or even check on the 12 empty tables to see if there was a cancellation. They've gotten really busy with the Uber Eats and Skip the Dishes traffic so they obviously don't care anymore. Will continue to hit Montana's across the street, with this kind of hit and miss service these days might as well ensure the game is on all screens and tables are available."}
{"text":"Stylish spot with a seafood inspired menu.  Six dollar beers for happy hour and lots of shareable favourites.  

On the menu, the Scotch Egg is particularly good and the tacos are savoury and well sized.  The soft seating and glass roof add to the comfort.  Good experience overall."}
{"text":"Really wanted to like The Wilcox, as I have been a bit desperate for a downtown Toronto style restaurant in the Mississauga/Brampton area. The Wilcox did not make the grade this time, but I will try it again in hopes that there was just a rough patch.

The look of the place is a combination of modern and rustic (e.g. Antler chandeliers) and it was pretty clear that they put a pretty penny in designing this place. In the Peel Region there are few good patio offerings, as nearly everything seems to face the street. They did a good job of designing this one to be parking lot facing, but also secluded by a series of shrubbery and a walled pathway. This may very well be the best patio in the area.

Inside the place is bustling (on this Wednesday night around 8-9pm). It seems to be a bit confused on whether it is a gastropub or a club. Lots of trays full of shots floating to tables. The crowd is mainly 20 somethings suited up to the max, though I was in there in shorts and a nice t-shirt and certainly didn't feel like I was going to be judged.

The issue was mainly that most dishes had little errors, seemed to be 90% there, or were just downright screwed up.

We started with cocktails/beer. The beer is a real winner here, as there is a large variety of Ontario craft. The only non-craft were staples like Stella and Guinness. I had Side Launch's wheat ale, which is a great beer. My wife ordered from the cocktail menu. It's a nice menu, unfortunately they screwed up her Pisco Sour. They definitely forgot the simple syrup, which makes it a bitter and sour mess. It's possibly they over did it on the bitters too, because it was a bit brown. I complained and they remade it - 2nd one was great - so my guess is they just messed it up.

Appetizer was an octopus dish. It was cooked really well and it had some really well paired ingredients (e.g. Pesto; nuts; chorizo; etc). It was missing citrus though, which really had the balance off again. Even a squeeze of lemon across the top would of made this a great dish. It seems like a pretty obvious addition, which made me thinking something was forgotten again. I chose not to complain about this one.

My wife had a pasta entree (cream based; with a seafood protein I believe). Nice but needed pepper, which was not offered when the meal came. They brought a grinder over when we asked and that made for a really night dish.

I had steak frites. Fries were delicious, came with a chimichurri sauce that was really good, and my steak was raw as heck. I had ordered it medium rare, but even the waitress (who did not bring the dish) was baffled by how under cooked it was. She said they'd fire me a new one. They just retired the old one, but it was still enjoyable when it returned.

The waitress at this point was pretty apologetic. To their credit it was busy as hell and the wait staff were getting hammered. That being said, the kitchen did not appear to be and they were standing around joking a lot. Since several errors were there's, they do not really have an excuse.

The waitress offered us a free desert in apology - we had the churro's. These were pretty good, but the wait was a bit absurd for these (20 minutes after ordering) given it's literally produced from a piping bag and then few minutes in the frier.

Still - things were good enough to make me think this might have been an off night. I will come back and try again and will update everyone."}
{"text":"Swanky spot in the burbs. Conveniently located near the highway and square one. Ambience is pretty good, decor is unique and the two level plan inside a country house is cute. Prices for drinks are a bit steep but it's worth it for a nice outing once in a while. 

Come celebrate a birthday, anniversary or whatever. The vibe inside will get u in a party mood in no time."}
{"text":"I love that this awesome place is near where I live. The food is great and the menu actually does change subtlety. I was here this time around for their $1 oysters. I don't know what kind they were but who cares! You can't go wrong with a buck-a-shuck :)

I sat at the bar while was waiting for my friend and the bartender there was very friendly and got me a drink right away. When my friend arrived we moved to a table in the corner. Our waitress, Anna, was awesome. Very friendly and checked up on us a good amount of times. My friend got the Meat Pie with Bone Marrow and I got a dozen oysters. Anna mentioned that my oysters may take up to 30 minutes because they were shucked to order, which was fine.

We ended up getting our food at the same time so that was great. The Meat Pie tasted amazing. The bone marrow was good too but when I got to the bottom of the bone the marrow was solidified and I had to stop eating it. Hopefully for next time they heat the marrow from the bottom of the bone or something too.

My dozen oysters came and it was such a beautiful sight. It came with a house made cocktail sauce with freshly grated horseradish and an apple and shallot mignonette. It was so good that I had oyster regrets and I ordered another dozen. The Wilcox have this special on Tuesdays and Wednesdays starting at 5pm."}
