{"text":"If your expectations aren't terribly highly then you won't be too disappointed. I was going to say standard cheap buffet and give two stars, but when I got to the tray of fried chicken wings, complete with a few fried feathers, I decided to drop down to one star.  I don't think there is a repeat in my future."}
{"text":"I had lunch here with Rand H and I found all the food here to be good to real good. They had these little breaded pork riblets that were awesome. The price was under  7 dollars including drink and I left with a full belly.This place could get more stars if they just took care of it better. there is a stink in the place that seems to be coming from the dirty carpet (replace carpet) Graffiti all over bathroom walls (paint them) These problems are so obvious why are they not addressed. If you are going to own a restaurant one would think you would have pride in it. Or maybe look for a career in something not customer service related."}
{"text":"Good food  Low prices Not a fancy restaurant,  but ok for a buffet"}
{"text":"all of the food was very old and overcooked. not many options. lots of old and odd flavored chicken. way overpriced for what it is. go to a different buffet, you're gonna be disappointed in this one. the place isn't clean either. will not be returning."}
{"text":"This place runs hot and cold. Some days the food is awesome, others its meh. Price isn't bad. Place could use renovation and someone dedicated to picking up the used dishes more often."}
{"text":"The food is worth the money, nothing special. I would have gave it three stars if it wasn't for the lady up front that takes the money. She always has the worst attitude and make you feel like you're inconveniencing her."}
{"text":"I just don't understand why this place is still in business.  I wouldn't think that this part of town was so desperate for a Chinese Buffet that it would keep frequenting the place.  I just don't know....  Rent must be really really low.  Buffet size was fine, though with all their space you might have thought that they would have done more. Tons of seating - and I know I've driven past it when it looked packed.  Which is why we gave it a try.  What's the word for barely fine?  Ok, but not quite that good.  Passable?  I think that would be it, yet it almost sounds too positive.  The food was passably ok.  I think I just made up a word, but it will work.  You won't get sick, and you might find some things to pick at."}
