{"text":"In my opinion one of the tastiest wraps around. The eggplant spread is to die for. The price is on point. Most times I can't even finish it, it's huge."}
{"text":"Unimpressed with the chicken shawarma , very boring and I didn't finish it which is super rare for someone like me. I definitely won't be coming back."}
{"text":"Great lamb kabob (excellent price) and customer service!  Popular with schools in area as healthy alternative to McDonalds and other fast food places in the area."}
{"text":"I wish you could do 1/2 stars (or out of 10)... I'd be on the fence on 4 or 4.5 stars, but anyways.  I'm not an expert of middle eastern cuisine.  I say this after being to (I'd be surprised if wrong) more than 30 joints of all casualness, but more on the fast-food side like Sofra.  I've had my fair share of dishes and shawarmas, but I haven't got to fully \"get\" the cuisine insofar as distinguishing without a doubt this has a great/medium/low quality.  For middle eastern, I stick to what agrees with my personal palate.  After reading about, and walking past this place many times, I decided to try it out with my loose change, and try out the staple: a simple chicken shawarma pita (easy to compare vs. many other places).  What I found: 1) A \"clean\", large enough pita that is quite packed and JUICY 2) The dabbles of hot sauce actually have good spice to it (beauty), so I will ask for more next time! 3) Already a big fan of eggplant, this will not disappoint! 4) Pita shell is a tad thicker than many places, but not too thick 5) Stomach left perfect fullness, and it told me it was \"very satisfied\" for $7.05.  So, at the end, I gave it a sold 4 (with 4.5 potential), I will definitely need to back to try out their other offerings!"}
{"text":"If I could give this place zero stars I would . Worst experience buying middle eastern food in my life . I ordered a dinner and a lunch shawarma plate and have never been so disappointed with the quality the amount and overall taste of this food. Not to mention the fact that I spent $30 dollars for trash food and I didn't even get a lot of trash food I got less food from this place then better tasting places for $9 bucks for a dinner. I would never go here ever again and I would never advise any one to go here unless your into enjoying unseasoned chicken and plain rice and dry salad."}
{"text":"Four stars because of the most delicious falafel sandwich. It comes with all the regular toppings plus some saucy eggplant, which is really next level. The falafel are made to order.  The small falafel plate was disappointing. Just falafel balls and rice and green salad. No hummus or tabuleh. So, great quality and super tasty when you make the right menu choice."}
{"text":"SERIOUS SANDWICH!  Easily the best falafel sandwich in the city. The balls are wonderfully sized, crunchy crisp, deep golden, gently spiced, and fried fresh before your eyes.  Veggies are mega-fresh and the sauces are perfect. Don't forget the swooning imam...the braised eggplant is amazing in the wrap.   This generous falafel will fill you up while ticking  every box....quality AND value...$5.50 is the bar to entry...I get mine medium spicy....even the hot sauce is house made and is full of fresh pulverized chilis!"}
{"text":"Awful. The worst shawarma I've ever had. Cold, dry flavourless meat inside a rock hard pita. Not sure what they serve on the days when people think it's good there."}
{"text":"big fan of this place!  their falafel is the best. why i give them 4? because the washroom is AWFUL! i have been there enough times to tell u that it was not cause it was late in the day, the washroom smells old, nasty, and just yacky.  oh, and the other part is because customer service is not very nice there, but because i have been there so many times i know they are not happy working there, they just seemed miserable there, im not blaming the place, neither them....im just saying....once u get to know the people there, they can be kind.  but......the good part if u dont have to use the washroom..... the food. the best: their side portion of eggplant, U HAVE TO TRY IT! its a must....sooo good.  i can only talk about the falafel, as it is the only vegetarian option they have :(  but i always go back anyways because i have tried falafel in some other places, and yes, they might be cheaper, but there is a reason why. here, u will be satisfied and even though they are not so nice when serving u, they have everything ready quick."}
{"text":"I eat shwarma around the area. I know shwarma. Their pita wrap, with all of the fixings, is amazing. Best hands down. Their hot sauce, or paste, is handmade, homemade and delicious; very spicy and such a kick. They add grilled seasoned eggplant which is also amazing. My favourite part of this shwarma and why I keep going back.  When I can, I go to Sofra Express. It is by far the best because of choice of topping and flavour. You will enjoy it for sure!"}
{"text":"Humus heaven, shawarma shanti and falafel fiesta.   A fast food outlet of the great turkish place from beyond the dark Mountains of dufferin.  Fast, fresh, flavorful. A+++++"}
{"text":"This place is great and cheap.the food is amazing. Again...try to get a parking spot on st. Clair is insane."}
{"text":"Really authentic tasting Shawrmas... These guys spice them really well and everything tastes quite fresh. Its still a shawrma joint so don't expect amazing ambiance or service, but it is still worth it.!"}
{"text":"i honestly do not get where the good reviews come from but i will try one last time. i have been twice, and not yet ordered because of the hostile environment, unfriendly service and have just walked away.  maybe in that culture, smiling is not normal? i don't get it.  is there a day of the week or a time, or some sort of secret handshake to get the sort of service that says..\"thanks for the business! come again! \" ?  what am i doing wrong? i smile, say please and thank you...  i dunno, man. i think the good reviews are all fake"}
{"text":"I have very mixed feelings about this place.  I stopped here after my workout to refuel myself on some yumminess.   it was around 11pm and they were pretty much empty. they charged me right away and then I stood there hanging waiting for someone to come by and finally put the falafel pita for me together. I only ralized after that they've been waiting for the falafel to get fried but I felt awkwardly left alone and not paid attention to.   well whatever. the falafel itself is aaaamazing! for $5.50 the pita is stuffed with all kinds of vegetables and sauces but in addition to regular greens, radish, pickles and tomatoes they add pickled cabbage AND eggplants!!! SO DELICIOUS SO GOOD!  Be cautious though - the spicy sauce is REALLY spicy and I thought my brain will melt in fire.... but I survived to write this review.   so 3 for the service and 5 for the food gives an average rating of 4 for this place."}
{"text":"Best falafel in Toronto! I can't speak for everything on the menu as I'm vegetarian, but the food is priced very reasonably and the staff have been friendly every time I have visited. I go for lunch at least once a week. Try the eggplant it's amazing!"}
{"text":"Not bad. The portion is pretty big. The service is kinda slow though..."}
{"text":"This is apparently a mostly-takeout outpost of the Sofra Grill in Thornhill.   Yummy, fresh shawarma and falafel.  Not quite as cheap as Ali Baba's (say), but reliable, clean, and (for me) very convenient.  It's become a staple for when neither of us wants to cook and we just want to grab something on the way home.   Very generous portions; we rarely finish everything.   Big fans of the falafel in particular."}
{"text":"Been here several times since moving to the neighborhood a couple months ago... the staff is always friendly and the food is always great!!"}
{"text":"If you need a quick sandwitch with good taste this is the place. The lentil soap is good but I can be warmer."}
{"text":"this place is pretty good.  when i used to live in the neighbourhood i really enjoyed their salads.  they vwere filling and a good portion in the dinner size with lots of protein and esthetically pleasing.  everything is actually quite good, love the wraps as well lots of variety in meat and at the end of the day the quality is there.  its not the kind of place that cuts corners which i find often.  with that said the place isnt cheap either but worthwhile.  the only downfall would be to maximize profit though the restaurant is not old nor overly rundown, it could use a simple facelift starting with the bathroom lol.  the staff is also qyite nice and friendly when you get to know them.  :)"}
{"text":"We pick up from here fairly regularly and really enjoy the food. It's not a fancy spot but you can rely on friendly service and good pricing: overall a really good bang for your buck. The kefta is my favorite while my wife loves the chicken....the only caution would be the potatoes..they add a lot of garlic which sometimes can be a little overpowering."}
{"text":"This place is amazing! The food is delicious, fresh and healthy; not oily some middle eastern can be. I have tried many middle eastern restaurants and this is easily my favourite one.  the portions are huge and the prices are very reasonable. They do delivery. what more can you ask for when you need a quick easy meal?"}
{"text":"We've visited Softa in Thornhill regularly and have always had a pleasant experience.  This location pales in comparison.  The food quality was poor.  The counter staff were a man in his 20's who moved at a snail pace along with a young trainee who tried to do her best under the circumstance; with little to no guidence from him.  The man appeared more interested in socializing with female patrons and joke around rather than do his job.  We ordered falafels and beef Shish Kabob.  The falafel sat there for 15 minutes before the young man put it together in a pita.  The Kabob was burnt to a crispy and the young man didn't apologize.  He just said \".. Sit and I'll make another one\".  The men's washrooms had no soap and in spite of asking for soap we had to use the woman's washroom to source out soap.  We will never return to this place and were thoroughly disappointed."}
{"text":"As part of our attempts to try food options in our area, we went to have dinner at Sofra Grill when neither myself nor my gf wanted to cook. We have passed by this place a few times since moving in to the area in our walks and have finally had the chance to try it out. As opposed to some of the yelp reviews, Sofra was a pleasant surprise. Unlike the previous reviews, the place was clean including their bathroom. From the take out window, you can tell the food is fresh and doesn't have a sad look. I had a lamb shish kebob in a pita and my gf had chicken ceasar. The lamb was really good. Tender and juicy with a good amount of spice. The fillings in the pita which included humus, tatziki and sauteed eggplant tasted fresh and complimented the meat. The pita was nice and soft. Had a taste of my gf salad. That was good too. I'm not sure what they used for a marinate, but the outer layer had a slight crisp to it. It was white meat and it was not dry. Cooked to perfection in my opinion.The salad itself had the right amount of dressing. The only thing is that I had hoped is they had more veggies than the lettuce itself."}
{"text":"Falafels are made fresh to order. Wraps come with delicious eggplant condiment. The salad sampler is a great option. It come with four choices, we had beets, eggplant, chickpeas and tabbouleh.  Two falafel wraps ($6.25 each) and salad sampler ($8.50) came to $24 with tax. Not the lowest cost but quality ingredients and great flavour."}
{"text":"I've been here four times. I'm giving the place five stars because these are the best falafel sandwiches I've ever tasted. The shawarma wraps are amazing. The spicy sauce is incredible.  My only \"complaint\" is the same one I always have for rotis and panzerottos. The wraps are a little too big. It's not really sharing food, it's not the kind of food you want to save half for later, and I like having sides. But a falafel pita here is a whole meal. Super picky thing to say for sure, but again, I gave the place five stars because it's the best.  It's a fast food joint and the ambiance reflects that; I would eat this food on a date but not under their fluorescent lights. I highly recommend grabbing a wrap to go and enjoying the best pita around as you adventure through the city."}
{"text":"Their chicken shawarma is very fatty. Since they've changed owners I figured they would change their chicken shawarma but nope still the same."}
{"text":"I love shawarma and middle eastern food in general. Usually once I stick to a place I enjoy, I don't stray away. My boyfriend and I were feeling adventurous and wanting to try something new, so we decided to give Sofra a shot.  First thing I noticed was how unapproachable and cold the man was. He wasn't kind, seemed rushed and annoyed. We both ordered the chicken shawarma combo. I noticed that his method of making the shawarma was a little odd. He didn't even let the shawarma sit long enough on the grill to get any marks to even become warm.  I asked him for some garlic sauce on the side and he then decided to charge me $2.00. Wtf? $2.00 for garlic sauce???? That is the price of a side of fries on their menu. At that moment I decided I was never going back. When the food was ready they gave us two shawarmas and only 1 side of fries. I said, what about the fries? He said he already gave us one. I said, well considering we ordered two combos, I'm sure this tiny plate isn't just for two orders.   The shawarma itself was flavourless and extremely difficult to eat considering the way he wrapped it. It wasn't warm and the meat was dry.   I didn't bother to finish my meal as I slowly started to feel sick.  I had stomach cramps and an awful ache for the whole day. Sofra food litterally did not sit well with me and I will NEVER be returning.  Rude customer service. Ripping off their customers for sides / sauces. Tasteless chicken."}
{"text":"This place has the best falafel's in all of Toronto. Never have I had such a fresh tasting wrap. They deep fry the chick pea per order and use an oval shaped pita that looks like a large hot dog bun. So many fresh flavours and the hot sauce is perfect. It's very filling and the price is a bit much for a bunch of veggies (5.74 taxes in, I think) I would travel out of my way to eat here but since it's on my route from work to band practice, I've picked this over a couple other places on St. Clair.   The downside? Their service sucks. Never have I wanted to ask to be served more times in my life. Take notice."}
