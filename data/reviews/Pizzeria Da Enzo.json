{"text":"We were looking for quick bite so we found this pizzeria in the Venetian.  The price was a bit high but we were craving pizza so we ordered a large combo. Yuk, the pizza was really greasy, rather mushy and the topping was sliding off the crust as we were eating the pizza. My wife got sick that night and threw up and my friend got a bad case of diarrhea shortly after. I'm not sure what was spoiled but it wasn't good. I wasn't affected because I didn't eat as much of the cheese topping, not sure what ingredient was the cause but something wasn't right. I've had way better pizza for the price but what do expect for a 24 hour joint."}

I wouldn't recommend this place.  if you are hungry, head to strip for 24hr mc D."}
{"text":"Amazing New York slice pizza! Better than secret pizza in Cosmo that everyone raves about but being from New York this place has a slice that is very much comparable to a good slice from New York! The Burger joint right next to it has a great bacon cheese burger also! Great late night fix!"}
{"text":"If you want the best pizza west of New York City, this place is it!"}
{"text":"Breakfast! Convenient, tasty, reasonable.

It's in a food court, off the Venetian casino floor. We were staying at the Venetian and I wanted breakfast. Since I was still on east coast time, I was up and at it a little earlier than the hotel coffee shops. Pizzeria da Enzo makes breakfast sandwiches, has coffee, pastries, fruit, etc. Oh, yes and pizza although I did not have a slice with my bagel. Reasonable prices."}
{"text":"The place has been remodeled so most of the pictures of the place are no longer valid, plus they serve only pizza and maybe some calzones. The storefront is now blander just like their food. The pizza before the change in ownership was definitely much better, now it's $7 for a bland cheese slice."}
{"text":"Nasty place to come and eat pizza!!!
My husband and I ordered a calzone and it was cold from the middle so I returned it and they put it back in the oven and they gave it to me all burned from the bottom and still f***** cold!!!!
I went to complain and get my money back!!
Don't bother coming here!!!!!"}
{"text":"Home of average pizza, above-average prices, and slow service. 

Yes, that sums up this place in the food court at the Venetian Hotel. I'm sure they get their fair share of traffic as people are looking for food after leaving the clubs at night but stopping in here for a bite in the middle the afternoon was a mistake. The food was nothing but average and the cost was on the very high side. Definitely will not return here."}

{"text":"This pizza is NOT the same since it has changed hands. 
One of the reasons we love the Venetian was for this pizzeria and zeffrinos

It was almost raw inside and hard and cold 
The outside was hot 
They need to improve to come up th the standards if the last owners. 
Haven't been to zefrinos yet this trip but I hope it has not changed"}
{"text":"This place is Ridiculous. I along with a friend stayed at the Venetian and we are pizza lovers. All we wanted was something without meat and the chefs themselves don't know what's vegetarian and what's not. Being polite we asked them to please check why the chef is saying there is meat in the vegetarian pizza and the chef made fun of us. The next day we decided to try it again and the same chef decided to use dirty tongs on my garlic bread with tongs used for meat. We asked politely can you please use fresh tongs or maybe just gloves and he yelled \"WHAT IS WRONG WITH YOU?\"
I hate to give a bad rating but if someone has an allergy or food restriction please do yourself a favor and skip this place. Horrible attitude of workers."}
{"text":"It was 4:30am, I had just worked up an appetite over at Tryst in the Wynn, and I was headed back to my room, sans a lady friend. So, why the hell not get some grub; I mean, it was a pizza place in an Italian-themed hotel, how could I go wrong?

It was the only place open, the staff working this awful night/morning shift was clearly fed up with dealing with drunk people all night, and they were a bit slow and surly, keeping up with the the rapid-fire drunk babble.

There were only 4 kinds of slices available, and I decided on the calzone, which they only had to put in the oven to heat up. It took 10 excruciating minutes, but I took it back to my room, and it had ham and ricotta cheese in it, and it wasn't half bad. It was 49% bad, but it got the job done.

I'm sure I'll end up there again one of these mornings on my next trip."}
{"text":"For a pizza place that is open 24/7, it is pretty amazing!!!!! I came here around 4am and ordered a slice of margherita and a slice of sausage pizza. They said that they had the best pizza in town and they werent lying. $3.00 for a slice of pizza isn't bad at all. The margherita pizza was so amazing - it had the perfect amount of cheese and toppings. The dough itself was really aromatic and really tasty. I couldn't get enough of it. The sausage pizza was just okay. On top of great pizza, the staff is super friendly too! I will definitely be coming back;"}
{"text":"How could someone so drunk think pizza was so gross?

Take that little zen koan to your mediation pillow and let me know when you find enlightenment.

I can not even describe how disgusting the food was here.

And this was when I was starving at 5:00 AM after drinking all day at Wet Republic and all night at Hakasan.

The first few slices I bought looked like they had been cooked about three days ago and then left in someone's dorm room under the bed. I do not understand how the pizza wasn't fresh as the line was literally out the door. 

I wanted  some greasy, gooey, cheesy, bready carb and fat-filled substance to soak up all the vodka-sugar-free-red-bull that had overtaken the proportion of liquid in my blood stream.

So I waited (impatiently). And was given two slices of greasy deliciousness.....oh no, wait. Greasy? Yes! But also dry, nasty, tasteless crust, minimal red sauce, and veggies that looked (and tasted) like they had been fished out of a fridge featured on Kitchen Nightmares. And the cheese was cheap and somehow horrible. I like basically all cheese indiscriminately - this must have been some sort of fake-cheese-product, I honestly have no idea what I must have been eating.

Even the salad was bad. Again, not sure how you screw up lettuce. 

Next time, get room service or better yet, save yourself some calories, pass out on a empty stomach, and then get some eggs in the morning.  

Note:  Although the food was f-ing nasty, the staff was really nice even though they were dealing with the drunkest people in North America at that hour of the morning."}
{"text":"Awful. Awful. Awful. Greasy and nasty and stale pieces of pizza. We were just so pooped from running around the strip nonstop that we grabbed the first thing that we saw at the hotel. None of us finished our pieces... This was the worst part of the weekend."}
{"text":"If no one serving the food or at the cashiers knows what an item is, even though it's displayed right above on the menu, it is not a good sign they provide quality service. If they tell you they don't even carry said entree, walk out. Order the sandwiches/hamburgers at San Genarro Cafe next door."}
{"text":"Not too friendly on your wallet but dang when it's 4aam in the morning and ur turnt this is rly wurth like bruh those pizzas are bomb af it's open 24/7 and the pizzas are dank like the crust is the write ammount of crunch y and soft and DAAAAANG bomb dude but the jalapeno one was kinda spicy BUT WHO CARES YOLO i like the one with olives too and lots of meat yumddeedummdum woot woot"}
{"text":"Wow this was a truly disappointing experience. I ordered a chicken roll and realized even at lunch rush they are not made fresh from the oven. They are pre-made, refrigerated and then microwaved. While waiting around for the reheating of my roll I had a chance to look around to find their \"C\" rating from the department of heath.

What can I say it is refrigerated and reheated chicken so it is tough and tasteless. It is clear they have extremely poor management and no head chef to control quality.

It is a solid avoid."}
{"text":"So this is some of the worst Italian food I've ever had.  I ordered eggplant parmigiana and it didn't even vaguely resemble the dish.  It was so disgusting that I am taking time out of my otherwise stellar Vegas vacation to write about it.  I realize that this is a 24-hour food court, but I expect more for $14, especially considering that my pasta last night at Grand Lux Cafe was $16."}
{"text":"The only thing that this place has going for it is the hours.  It's one of the few places that's open at 3am.  The food isn't bad, but you can find better around town.  I've taken numerous pies back to the room for when I just want to relax.  The pasta is good, but reminds me of cafeteria-style food.  They also have garlic bread, salads, calzones, and strombolis.  All not bad, but like i said, at 3am, anything will taste better than the Cheddar Cheese Combos from the gift shop or the $10 candy bar in your room that the hotel will charge you for if you even just look at it wrong."}
{"text":"Ended up here for breakfast, actually... ok maybe the breakfast place shared the same space? I couldn't tell.

For $9 or whatever it was, the 4-item breakfast actually wasn't bad. French toast, scrambled eggs, bacon were all pretty good. Portions were also ample. It's not what I normally like in french toast, but it was still fluffy and cripsy and light enough... mmm. The sausage was a bit odd-- not cheap American breakfast sausage, but not awesome goodness either. My friends liked it, I was ambivalent.

When you're right on the strip, already in the casinos, and you don't feel like $20 or $30 on Sunday brunch, but you want something other than greasy fast good, this was a decent alternative.

I am curious about the pizza, too, although who goes to Vegas for pizza?"}
{"text":"Just got verbally harassed by the cashier Sandra who refused to take my change and resorted to yelling at me for wanting to use coins and bills for my payment. 

The food was way below average and this poor service definitely makes this a place I will not return. Enjoy your vacation and do not go into this place for poor service and below average food."}
{"text":"My secret love...in Vegas.

This place was the perfect place to get the goods that I needed in all the right times.

Eating clean is a daily challenge, especially when you are traveling. 

This place saved me by helping to get my daily need of proteins without the cost of room service and the cost of it as well...

I was able to order their delectable meatballs a la carte just for $1.98 per order, which is a steal in Vegas terms. 

I love that they were available at all hours of the day and that they helped me to eat clean even in Vegas."}
{"text":"YUCK.  I know, I know...I shouldn't expect much from a food court.  True.  But this place was seriously awful.  Upon walking up, I was enticed by what looked like a fresh and delicious bruschetta, so I ordered it and paid $6.50 for it.  The problem was they gave me the one in the display which was a refrigerator and it resulted in super hard, old and cold bread topped with tomatoes and cheese.  I tried to cut into it.  No luck.  I tried to break it into pieces.  Nothing.  I finally picked it up and tried to bit it and it was so hard that my TMJ kicked in.  It was totally inedible.  So I walked back over and told one of the 8 workers that I couldn't eat it. They told me to eat the tomatoes only. - um....REALLY?  When I said that was not why I ordered it, he said, well I can heat it for you.  I said \"I dont want hot tomatoes and melted cheese\"  He said \"Oh\" and rolled his eyes.  When I asked for my money back, several of the workers looked at me irritated and said \"you can go talk to the manager if you want\".  So I did.  She offered up anything on the menu to replace it instead of my money.  I ordered a slice of deep dish cheese pizza (which cost less than the bruschetta).  It was equally awful.  I highly recommend you go to another crappy food court location and skip this one."}
{"text":"Ok, I'm about to sound like a big-time snob here, but I think the existence of this place is bringing the Venetian down. I consider the Venetian to be one of the elite hotels in Vegas. There obviously are much cheaper hotel options in Vegas, so when I pay their unnecessarily high rates to stay at the Venetian, it probably means I'm trying to avoid the Circus Circus crowd. 

We came here Sunday morning because there didn't seem to be any standout breakfast options at the Venetian, and we wanted to get to the pool area as quickly as possible. I noticed this place served breakfast and even though it didn't appear to be their specialty, I thought \"Well, it's the Venetian. They must hold Enzo to some kind of standard, right? \" 

Wrong. 

I ordered a cheese omelet, along with a sausage link that could have been mistaken for a dog turd, except cold. It came with \"Italian toast\" which was just a thick slice of bread, also served cold. Not too good. I ended up ordering a slice of cheese pizza to go, which at least turned out to be edible. 

Meanwhile, I haven't even had my coffee yet and while waiting to pay, there's a lady holding up the line for 5 minutes because she can't get over that a slice of pizza costs $4.00. \"I aint payin four freakin dollars for one slice of freakin pizza!!\" Are you crazy??\" Uggghhh. Then get the fuck out of the line, dummy! 

The entire food court was a fucking zoo of hungover frat boys, gang-bangers, and lowest common denominator riff-raff. They should do live broadcasts of the Jerry Springer show there.

I'm not saying the Venetian needs to be like the Wynn by not including any reasonably priced food in the entire hotel, but they can and should step it up a notch if they want to be able to continue justify their room rates. I would have gladly paid a few more bucks to eat some quality breakfast food and be surrounded by people with a tiny bit more class. This place should go. They' should honestly just tear that entire food court down and build a new restaurant there. Half the fucking people that wrote reviews for this place apparently ate breakfast there. How about an actual breakfast place?"}
{"text":"I had such a delicious slice of Sicilian pizza in this little cafe. 
It was so good, so perfect.
Staff was friendly,
and they have a LOT of other choices if you don't want pizza!"}
{"text":"This place has gone down hill. Before they use to offer different options and even breakfast. Now it's only sell pizza for $8 a slice."}
{"text":"So I went to another pizza place in the afternoon and was soo disappointed and upset. So came to Enzo for dinner & was much happier. They're new worker here and kind of slow. Had to tell the guy to make my pizza HOT not warm. Had 3 slices. I know much a fattie hehee"}
{"text":"Four star NY style pizza in the Venetian?  Right off the casino?  Food court?  At 2AM  in the morning?  Yup.  Da Enzo.  Va bene!"}
{"text":"After a long night of going wild we finally settled in our rooms and were starving.  We almost decided to get room service when we remembered this little place downstairs.  My girlfriend called in and ordered a large cheese pizza with extra sauce and little cheese.  She decided to pick it up since it was so nearby.  The pizza was $20 and it was enough for the 5 of us that were eating.  The pizza was okay.  It was a thin crust and the dough was pretty soft.  They added extra sauce by applying it clumps so it looked like pepperoni.  I didn't think it was the best pizza but it was satisfying and convenient.  My girlfriend said her and another one of the other girls had a slice in the morning for $6 a slice.  Overall, it was okay... but not impressive."}
{"text":"Mall pizza at Las Vegas prices.  It was fast - and that was our goal, so on that account it met our expectations.  It wasn't bad pizza, but it wasn't great either."}
{"text":"Located in the food court, but definitely not food court food. The pizza was out of this world. Very sweet, I think Italian woman who appears to be the cook, was very warm and friendly. Stop in you'll be happy you did!"}
{"text":"On my way back to my car after a slightly disappointing meal at White Castle, I happened to pass by a food court and spotted a pizza by the slice spot. I wasn't very hungry, but I can't pass up the opportunity to try a slice of hot pizza!

I thought it was surprisingly good for being Food Court pizza. The cheese if what sold me on it, was just the right chewy texture. The sauce wasn't very good though. Decent toppings. Crispy crust. 

The slice that was given to me was thankfully hot, but my sister's slice was barely warm and not as enjoyable (crust got soggy, cheese hardened a bit, etc). Be vigilant, make sure you get a fresh slice!

I'll probably never eat here again just because there's so many better options in Vegas, but if it's three in the morning and you just want a regular slice of pizza (for about 5 bucks a pop), this spot will be just fine. 

Pros:
+ Chewy, tasty cheese

Cons:
- Sauce
- Not served hot consistently"}
{"text":"This pizza is the closest to NYC style pizza in Las Vegas so far. Their only down side is that it's in a casino, so those of us who live and work in Las Vegas, don't want to have to drive all the way to the strip and walk through a smoky casino to get a slice, but I still do it for this pizza once in a while. They also have gelato that's tasty and sides, and full course dishes as well."}
{"text":"Pretty typical Italian fast food, but a great choice if you're at the Venetian and not looking to fill yourself up too much. 

I got the Sausage and Pepperoni Calzone, which was so large I ended up splitting it with Kathleen W. I liked the fact that it was stuffed with normal mozzarella cheese, as well as cottage cheese, which made a really tasty mix. For some reason, when they say sausage and pepperoni, what they really mean is pepperoni made out of sausage. Strange contraption, but tasty nonetheless. It comes with a bowl of pasta sauce for you to dip in.

Overall a great alternative to a buffet, but a little bit on the pricey side, which was expected. If you split a calzone, though, you'll be off just fine."}
{"text":"Another Meeeeeh option in The Venetian food court. They have pizza and pizza related items as well as breakfast.

The breakfast was not good (eggs, sausage, potatoes). I still have no clue how one can mess breakfast up.

Pizza was whatever, not worth they money they charge. 

This place is one of the only late night food options in the hotel, so many people like me don't have a choice when trying to grab a bite at 4am after a night out."}
{"text":"My way better looking galf and I split a slice of stuffed spinach.  10 bucks, so pretty normal Vegas prices.  Yes they reheated it, that's pretty typical at every pizza joint, it was still good and not. 20 bucks a person like *insert Food Network personality*"}
{"text":"I had the egg and potato breakfast and it is so tasteless. I should have just get the croissant. The egg was too raw for me. They open early and service is ok but I will try other stall next time."}
{"text":"This place is conveniently located in the first floor of the Venetian, right next to the casino and before the elevators and escalators.

The pizza  is good. One thing I do have to complain about is How greasy it actually is. You have to take at least 3 napkins to absorb the grease."}
{"text":"Quick, right next to the casino floor. Prices are good considering where it's at. Pizza was pretty good. You are in a high priced casino, finding a meal with a drink for less than $20 per person is \"value\". This is a value."}
{"text":"I ordered the sausage and pepperoni Calzone and it had entirely too much ricotta cheese.  I'm part Italian,  so maybe I'm extra critical of Italian food places.   But I felt it could have had more meat and the crust was hard.   The pepperoni tasted cheap.  I guess you get what you pay for.  I am giving it one extra star for the cool guy who works at the Gelato station who let me sample just about every flavor since I'm indecisive sometimes :)"}
{"text":"Venetian food court, just off the main casino floor.  Pre-made, lots of topping choices went w/ 1 each of cheese and Pep.  Tossed in da oven when ordered. New York style - thin crisp bottom, light sauce, plenty of cheese, fold, chew, repeat.  

Perfect carb pickup to keep drinking and gambling!!"}
{"text":"There is not much to say because it was nothing special at all. We were in a hurry for lunch and this was the least crowded place in the Venetian food court. It wasn't bad but it was just average pizza, cut in smaller pieces then I am used to, for more money then I should have paid.

Again it wasn't bad, there just wasn't anything that stood out about it."}
{"text":"They would get a 1 star for the crappy service, but the slice was ok. Just ok. Food at 2:30 am. There isn't a lot open at the Venetian for something fast.

The people don't listen and just want to hurd you through like cattle. It's obvious they don't care. Here's your slice, keep moving.

Again, food ok, service so bad, what do you do when they are 1 of 2 places open and I don't want a $13 burger."}
{"text":"Very flavorful. Was pleasantly surprised that they're open 24 hours (seriously, food open 24 hours....it's Vegas. Come on!!) when it was sorely needed. Nothing else in and around the Venetian. Although the pizza doesn't \"look\" appealing (to me at least), it was very flavorful and i enjoyed it. I would be back again if at the Venetian."}
{"text":"Came here for lunch while staying at the Venetian.  Three of the four of us who at here had upset stomachs afterward.  I guess you can try your luck, though."}
{"text":"I was up very late gambling and i was hungry. I checked out the food court and found this spot. I got a pepperoni and mushroom slice. It was delicious and the crust was so thin and crispy.

Great spot for a slice!"}
{"text":"I know I'm drunk but reheated microwave pizza for $5+ is freaking awful, I don't care the quantity of bad things consumed during one's time in Vegas, this city is waaaay too incredible to be serving slop in a fantastic resort casino like this.
It's a true slap in the face to watch them pull a sad excuse of a pizza from a bin, toss it on a styrofoam plate, then carelessly slide it across the counter and act like it's a culinary masterpiece.
Next time, I'll do another line in the hotel room and skip mealtime altogether."}
{"text":"I always order an Enzo special whole pie for pickup every time I come Las Vegas.  The pizza is awesome and the crust is thin and crispy.    The place does not look like much but it's simple and it's open late."}
{"text":"Wow, I very much disagree with Elizabeth L.  I came here for lunch today because the line at Grand Lux Cafe was full of CES-goers, and the SO had to hurry to the show.  Anyways, we came here because he likes pizza.  The sausage pepperoni was decent, but the tomato basil was horrible.  No flavor, dry, and kind of a pain to ingest.  I'm not sure why I did.  Furthermore, the slices are like $5 a piece.  Not good."}
{"text":"The Pizza was okay at Pizzeria da Enzo.  I liked how they had huge thin NY Style slices.  A little pricey though, as I spent about $13 for 2 specialty slices.  Realistically though, your real reason for picking this spot is if you're at The Venetian with a serious craving for Pizza but don't want to waste time eating at a sit down restaurant or spend too much money on a meal.  That's basically the situation I was in when I went here.  Give them a try though, you might like the Pizzas they have to offer."}
{"text":"This is a decent place to grab a quick bite to eat at The Venetian.  You can buy whole Pizzas or Pizza by the Slice.  I decided to get 2 slices of Margherita Pizza.

They take them from the pre-made Pizza on display and throw them in the oven to reheat them....just like your typical by the Slice joint.  The Pizza is pretty average....not the best or worst I've ever had.  It's kind of expensive though....$8 for 2 Slices.

I'd come back if I was hungry and on the run...but it's not a destination place for me.

Return Factor - 50%"}
{"text":"No complaints here. We wanted something quick for dinner and the food was good (salad, italian grinder, pizza). I was having a hard time figuring out what sandwich to order so the guy behind the counter told me of the 1/2 salad, 1/2 sandwich deal which is what I ended up going for."}
{"text":"At the Venetian Food Court.  This, in my opinion, is amongst the new pizza in town.  I love the crust, the sauce has the kinds of flavor and spices I like, and the \"cheesiness\" is just right.  And it's open 24/7.  As of
7/19/17, the pizzeria has new owners and the store is being remodeled.  Can't wait to see if Pizzeria da Enzo retains its magnificence when it reopens!"}
{"text":"The great thing about this place is it's 24 hrs, so when you get back to the hotel late at night you're set with a quick meal.  

We came back to the Venetian around 130 am after a concert we attended.  Quickly ordered a whole pizza, which was already made.  They just heated it back up.  This only took around 15 minutes, so the wait wasn't long at all.  The price was astronomical, but it's Vegas so what's new??  One large cheese pizza cost us about 35 dollars.  It was actually pretty good though for food court pizza.  Large in size with plenty of cheese.  The crust was delicious...nice and thin with a thick crust.  They provided plates and silverware, so we could eat back in our room and relax!

I probably wouldn't opt to go here during normal dinner hours bc there are so many fantastic restaurants in Vegas to choose from.  But when everything is closed and you're limited on what you can eat, this place is great and will always be our go too after hours."}
{"text":"Well, this place was ok.  It's better than your average mall pizza court, but kind of the same type of atmosphere.  It's kind of geared to quick-slice-on-the-go and they quickly warm it up in the oven a la Sbarro.

I wouldn't go out of my way to eat here again but it wasn't bad.  The price is high, but it's Vegas.  You're not eating cheap anywhere."}
{"text":"Super oily and over priced! We couldn't even hold our slice of pepperoni pizza because it was so soggy... From all the oil! We got 2 slices that came to a total of $11! So not worth!"}
{"text":"Whenever I get tipsy, I always crave pizza. Luckily, this place sells it by the slice and their garlic knots were pretty tasty, although a bit too doughy for me. Patience is key as they reheat it in their ovens for a few minutes, but when the cashier line is short, you can pay first while you wait."}
{"text":"I think the people complaining about the pizza have some valid points. If you order the pizza that has been sitting there its not so good.  If you get a fresh pizza or slice its pretty damn good.  Very pricey for a slice but were talking about vegas where they charge you 18 dollars for a budlight in some spots.

3.8/5 stars. My brother says try the pepperoni pizza"}
{"text":"Average overpriced pizza but you get it anyways because it's 3am and you know if you don't eat something you'll have a hangover the next day.  Thanks for being there for me, Pizzeria Enzo.

We were staying at the Palazzo and stopped here after clubbing at Surrender because I was craving pizza.  Alcohol and staying up too late does bad things for my metabolism I tell you.  Glad this place was open and ordering was super quick.  Really quite overpriced though--$6.50 for a slice of margerhita because I wanted something vegetarian.  

Nothing special but it does the job."}
{"text":"Pretty good thin sliced pizza, their pepperoni and sausage calzone is pretty good! Make sure to get marinara sauce in the side. Expect to wait a few minutes for the calzones. I would definitely come back."}
{"text":"It's a 24 hour food court pizzeria but I'm rounding up to 4 stars because it's the cheapest option in Venetian and the staff is friendly.

I wish I had taken a picture of the grease. I literally had to use 6-8 napkins per slice to get even some of the grease off the top of the slice. It was great drunk food though. 

The prices on the ready made (assorted) pizza slices are reasonable $5-$6 range. The slice filled me up for at least half the day. 

Lots of restaurants in Venetian are over hyped so if you just want something cheap grab a slice here and save your money for gambling."}
{"text":"They say they are open 24/7...that is false. I cannot believe how Yelp has not updated their hours. Like are you kidding me. It's clearly not open after 8PM. Hey yelp, get it together and list the correct hours."}
{"text":"As soon as you step foot in the Venetian food court, the delicious smell of calzone, and freshly cooked pizza wafts past your nose pulling you towards \"Pizzeria da Enzo\". Whenever I need to satisfy my soul with some thin, crispy, excellently cooked pizza, this place has what I crave! 

You walk in and they make you walk past all their lasagna, baked ziti, cold sandwichs(tomato, basil & mozzerella deliciousness) all the way to the pizzas. The smell alone... MmMMmmm.. Makes my mouth water just thinking about it. Don't be tempted by the initial food as you're on your way to the main event, the back, where the pizza pie's are. This is why you are here. They have many varieties to satisfy all, including (but not limited to) margarita(have to make italian hand gestures when ordering this pizza), mushroom, hawaiian style(pineapple & ham), pepperoni, cheese, and sausage. Heated to order, and they even give 10% discount to anybody who works in the Venetian and Palazzo. 

Im a typical \"west coast pizza eater\" and need my ranch with each and every bite, but with this pizza you don't even need it. Flavorful, crunchy, and delicious.. Exactly how pizza was meant to be made and eaten."}
{"text":"This was a frequent hot spot for me while in Vegas recently staying at the Venetian because it was open 24hr and in the wee hours of the morning, nothing is better than a big slice of fabulous NY style cheese pizza. Tasty blend of a hint of garlic and oilice oil and cheese queesy with very little sauce (best!). Could also get ice cold water out of the ice which was a nice treat in hot LV after drinking alcohol all day :)  Also a hot spot to get a whole pizza to take to the room or to the pool which would be great for a group. I know I saw a lot of pizza boxes sitting in the hall outside of rooms."}
{"text":"I'm giving this place 1 star because the cooks are great BUT unfortunately the cashiers have the crappiest customer service. When i ordered my pizza this morning she had me repeat it 5 times so i would think she would know what i paid for.. but when the food came out it was wrong and i had to wait for her to come back from her break because the other girl couldnt assist because she didnt want to take the blame so we waited for the other girl and when shs cam back, she was rude af and said 'so what's the problem? You okay'd the order so there is no problem, you wanted that pizza'. (You can tell all she cared about was eating her food) It was bascially my word against hers. Rude af, i wish i got her name.

MANAGEMENT- Please teach your cashiers to come at customers correctly. I go to Vegas every other month and i usually eat here and because of my experience today, i will not be returning."}
{"text":"Excellent breakfast special from 6am- noon. Ten bucks gets you some your choice of four items (veggie frittata, scrambled eggs, pancakes, bacon, oatmeal), plus toast and coffee. A great quick stop. Also, their pizzas happen to look pretty damn good, too."}
{"text":"How do i start this..... first of all the costumer service is the worst, the cashier and the pizza server look like they don't want to work, they don't smile at all. The server ignored me didn't bother to ask for my order, I asked the cashier for a drink didn't even asked me what kind of drink i wanted she just gave me poured Pepsi and gave it to me. Definitely don't recommend this place to eat not even if you're drunk at least you're a fan of oven reheated pizza. They need to work on their costumer service a little more........"}
{"text":"Pizza and garlic bread was alright. Lets get real the only reason we ate here is because it's the only place open 24hrs. Later on they do have breakfast items."}
{"text":"A nice spot for late night munchies. Pizza and Stromboli are pre-made and reheated to order,

Price are good for the Venetian.


Food quality is okay when you have the late night munchies but not spectacular.


Three out of five stars."}
{"text":"Nice food at a moderate price for those on the go.  Highly recommended.  Pizza; pasta and more.  Fast service if you're not looking for a long meal.  Free wi-fi in the area."}
{"text":"This is where to go to get ripped off for pizza. While the pizza tastes perfectly fine, it's nothing spectacular except in price. $7.82 for a slice of plain pizza is just plain robbery. And I'm from NY where a slice can run $5. This was just ridiculous. Not impressed."}
{"text":"It was late, I was hungry. So, came here for a slice and some garlic knots/sticks. Pizza was pretty good, but wished they put it in the oven a bit longer so the crust could be a bit more crispy. The garlic knots/sticks were not good at all. Dry and probably would've been better with some sauce.

Not a bad options if you need something late at night."}
{"text":"I stayed at the Venetian Hotel this past weekend and the food court is this pizza place.  Let me start out by saying the pizza was pretty decent.  Now for the reason why I will never go back and I urge fellow yelpers to use caution.  You go in the back and place your order, the guy getting you your pizza doesn't speak or understand English.  I told him I was in a rush and I'd take the pizza cold and that had to turn into entire dissertation and he still threw it into the oven, so I had to tell someone else I wanted it cold.  Then the cashier ... Friendly enough .... She tells me the price $14.59 ..... I pay with my credit card where the tip is located I wrote in 0.00 because it's just self service.  By the time I got upstairs to my room a received a notification on my iPhone that tells me this pizza place charge my card for $16.78.  I was like wasn't it $14.59???? I check my receipt and it sure was $14.59..... Did this place add in a tip??? It's funny because I think we're all guilty of signing a receipt and throwing it away and not keeping it to see if the place charged more. Well this place did,  I couldn't figure it out.  I tried calling them but every number listed for them was not the correct number, so I went back down to the restaurant to see if there were any sur charges I missed, like taking extra napkins etc .... Nothing written on the walls ... I I took was three napkins.  I went back to my room and check my other receipts and lone and behold I had three other receipts all charged for more than what I had signed for.  I spoke to AMEX and they told me that they would investigate and ask the establishment to provide them with the all the receipts I signed for.  This is a dishonest place and they're to many choices especially in Vegas open all night to be suckered by these people."}
{"text":"Ridiculous... been coming here for 10+ years, and there had been a change in management and business name, but the pizza is still the same....and they won't serve a whole pizza for whole pizza price.  They'll Only sell for the pizza by the slice!  Managment won't acknowledge loyalty nor will they make the change of \"their\" rules.


$64 for a pizza is extortion.  No where in the world would you pay these prices...the money isn't the issue... I'll pay that for a steak... but the principle of charging that much for a pizza is what I have a problem with.  Most places you can get a pizza for under $10 and these guys want to charge $8 for a slice.  


I would suggest other options.  That pizza costs no more than $5 to make for ingredients, labor and rent. 

That's not good business for the consumer!"}
{"text":"Best New York slice I've had in the Vegas. Good margarita pizza. Delicious garlic knot. They also serve the good type of ranch!"}
{"text":"Who wants to go to a sit down diner at 5 in the morning when you're inebriated and your feet are killing you? Definitely not me! 

Well, welcome to pizza heaven - this place is open 24/7 with quick to go service and it's delish - 5 stars all the way! They make your pizza fresh within 10 or so minutes. We always take it up to our room and devour every last crumb! Perfect hangover-prevention meal.

If you're staying in The Venetian, it's a late night must! I always look forward to staying at The Venetian because of this place. Is that weird? Whatever."}
{"text":"I was called in for nightshift at 2:30am at the Venetian and was hungrier than a monkey with no bananas and fortunately my boss treated us to this pizzeria place that just so happen to be open this late.

What a find if you happen to be walking around the strip near the Venetian this late and craving just about anything to fill that tummy up.  The pizzas are good, especially the NY style but why a 3 star you ask? It's because unfortunately, I've had the opportunity to try out the secret pizza place at the Cosmo and also my fav pizzeria joint (Familia Pizzeria) which both also happen to serve a better NY style pizza.  

They also serve other dishes besides pizzas.  Their pitas are pretty good I must say, which comes with just about any fillings of meat and vegetarian only if your into that whole vegan thing (poor thing missing out!).  My buddy tried the tuna which he gave me a thumbs up when I asked how it was and I tried the grilled chicken pita which also gets a thumbs up from me.  

Ok I better get back to work! When you see that big mask on display outside of the Venetian, just know the lighting aspect of that mask were results of my crafty electrician hands.  Yea, that's right!...I'm going off subject to make room to take some credit off that. But if it doesn't light up or fails, blame my boss."}
{"text":"Generic, quick, greasy, NYC knockoff

Not bad, just not worth seeking out.  BUT if you happen to be sloshed and stumbling past or directly into this joint after leaving a club, a lounge, a show, a slot machine, pretty much anywhere on the strip, your hotel room at 5pm,
OR
spent all day eating peanuts at a sports book then this place is a very pleasant surprise.  

Pizza by the slice, Sicilian, Stromboli, spaghetti and meatballs, and breadsticks...with virtually all items under $5, it will leave you with a little extra dough to hit the blackjack table again after all that alcohol gets soaked up."}
{"text":"First off, I want to thank this place for being open 24/7. 
I was happy it was located right across our hotel cause who has time to go somewhere fancy after being at the club all night long and your feet are killing you. For a whole pizza it's a little pricey but if you're splitting the check between a group it's not so bad. The crust was a little burnt but I was just so hungry I didn't really care. The service was quick and the staff were very attentive. I would definitely recommend coming here for a late night snack and I'll look forward to coming here my next Vegas trip! Perfect hangover prevention meal."}
{"text":"The drunk me is in LOVE with this place! Easy, convenient, cheap, accepts CC
Sober me would ask \"Why am I here when there are so many better places\"
It's on the casino level so easy to find."}
{"text":"Food is ok, but worst customer service ever. Employees standing idle and chatting while customers wait for service. No trays to put the food on. I felt like I was an imposition on their time not a customer. I've had better customer service at Taco Bell."}
{"text":"The only good thing about this place is that it's open 24hours. So if u r up gambling the entire night or came back to hotel after a late night party, still you can grab a pizza slice on ur way to room. But taste wise the place is just trite. The pizzas are extremely buttery and the pasta is topped with a runny sauce."}
{"text":"Damn great place to grab a quick slice of pizza inside The Venetian. I've had the pepperoni on many a late night. Recently had the meatball & pepperoni and really liked it. Perfectly crunchy crust. Good toppings with tasty cheese. Yes, you fold the pizza. That's the only way to eat a slice that big. I don't know why my friends & I don't just order a whole pie. Enjoy..."}
{"text":"Terrible terrible food! Not one item I tried was worth finishing...

Choose from burnt vs rubbery vs cold vs stale"}
{"text":"The worst lasagna I have ever eaten in my life. For $12.95, I got fake meat that has been sitting in the warmer the entire day. The server was in no rush to serve me either; gossiping with another worker was more important than attending to the only customer who was standing before them - RUDE."}
{"text":"A pizza slice costs 2 spins on the penny slots.  But the slice only lasts one spin.  Nom"}
{"text":"This place has changed ownership and it's disgusting now. I've never knew pizza couldn't taste good. How could someone make pizza not taste good? The sauce is bland the cheese taste artificial. It was so horrible I use to love this place and the homemade lasagna now it's more pricy and disgusting."}
{"text":"The pros of this place is that it's a pizza joint open late at the Venetian. Since I'm a huge fan of secret pizza, I wasn't too impressed with the pizza here. The crust was OK. I only got to try the single topping, mushroom pizza. It's good enough to fill up your belly if you're hungry, but I'd rather go elsewhere for some good pizza."}
{"text":"omg literally extra star for being open 24/7 and being tolerable to my obnoxious starving drunk ass whining about being hungrrrrryyyyyyy ):

so after surrender, i really really wanted to try grande cafe lux or whatever in the Venetian, but my friend who i was dragging around did not want to sit in a restaurant because it was like... 5am (.....blame the taxi line out of Encore). and i also wanted eggs (why? i have no idea). and he dragged MY ASS to this place instead and they had this 4 items for $10 special. We got the french toast, eggs, sausage and quiche! 

The employees could have loaded up a bigger portion,,, so skimpy -______- But the french toast was MEH, the eggs were pretty bland but the sausages and quiche was really good!!! and not because i was drunk either! LOL the sausages had this different taste to it and the quiche had spinach and it was all toasty and flakey. YUM! 

the 2nd time i came here, i was pretty drunk from TAO Beach, so my other friend cheered for pizza so we came here. omggggggg their pizza is to die for. The slice portion is average for the price... but pizza still super delicious. they dont skimp on mushrooms, sauce, sausages, cheese... etc. the crust is also awesome, not cold or hard like some places! We were munching on them waiting for our valet parking, but we loved teh pizza so much we went back for more!"}
