{"text":"Good service, good chigae! I had the spicy seafood noodle soup. The seafood selection in the soup was not really the highest quality, but the actual broth was fantastic! And for 10 bucks, the value was excellent.  Not really my kind of side dishes--I prefer more traditional dishes, but the French fries were nice mix-matched cut thick spears (very fresh), the corn and cheese was interesting (although, a little difficult to maneuver with chopsticks), and the fish cake/curd thing was enjoyable. This is mostly a drinking spot--not really a place to get your eat on."}
{"text":"I went here to celebrate finishing exams with a couple of classmates. The first thing I noticed is how dark it was, lit only by small tea candles. I had so much difficulty trying to read the food/drinks menu but I'm not sure if that's classic of Korean style bars.  Food isn't the greatest but I was told by my friend that this place is more for drinking than for food. They give a lot of free food (always a plus ++) and there are combos where you order a meal and it comes with a bottle of soju as well. There really isn't anything else to say about this place. Nothing really stood out and it was just mediocre and maybe even below average. I'd come back if my friends wanted to but other than that, I'd go with another establishment, as there are many in the Annex/Korean town area."}
{"text":"Camtoe is your solid generic Korean pub food destination.  What sets this place apart rests primarily in the decor and location.  One block east of Christie station, Camtoe sits noticeably on the north-west corner of Clinton street, directly across from karaoke joints that pushes the limits of  your night out.  Big tables are in the front and quieter tables are at the back.  Don't expect any curtains or walls to separate you from the rest of the diners though.  What makes me keep coming back is the unlimited (within reason) refills of side dishes and courtesy food items that are sometimes lacking in other Korean pubs.  You can count on Camtoe to replenish your side dishes that are on-the-house while you enjoy your standard 5 beer or 1 Soju + main dish for $20 ~ $30."}
{"text":"Great soju yogurt and food.   But here are the reason why you shouldn't support this resturant:   They don't give proper receipts!  When you ask for the bill, they only scribble some gibberish on it, and you can never figure out how they got to the total  (Way to go for taking advantage of your drunk customers).    You can't use credit card or debit either.  The ATM is a pretty far walk in the cold.    When I asked for a receipt,  they waitress said they don't give receipt at first.  Then I asked to speak to the manager, so they only scribble the total onto another receipt book  without any GST #, Date, or restaurant name.  If you don't plan on paying tax, then don't open a business in Canada.  Charging your customers 13% hst, or 15% as mentioned by another reviewer earlier, is just pure profit for the owner.  And if you're the owner and you're reading this, I hope you changes you business ethic before CRA catches up to you :)"}
{"text":"I went to this establishment on a saturday evening for drinks. The evening started out decently with plenty of food and alcohol being consumed but things quickly went sour when the bill came. I will not go here again and strongly recommend you do not either.  The good :  Lots of free food korean food is provided to entice customers to continue drinking and ordering more alcohol. The food is of decent quality. There are combos that pair a bottle of soju or 5 bottles of a beer with a plate of food to snack on. This is not uncommon for Korean restaurants. The combos are normal priced/slightly expensive. Up to this point we had no complaints and the service was decent, even if a little slow.   The (very) bad :  When asked for the bill we received a paper with some handwritten words in Korean and some scribbles that looked like numbers. A number for the amount of tax and the total was placed at the bottom of the bill. After trying to deduce how much to leave for tip, it was noticed that the tax charged was 15% and not 13% for HST in Ontario. When confronted the waitress insisted that it is correct and tax is 15%. When confronted again with a much harsher tone, they contacted the manager who re-calculated with 13% tax.   When asking other customers to check their bills, it was discovered that all of them had been taxed at 15%. I have no patience or respect for these methods of conducting business. I will never go here again and hope you do not either."}
{"text":"I used to love this place. Nice interior, good service, good food. A bit expensive but I've always had a good time here. Sad that this place has closed down. Its now a place called Japas. A more quiet version of Guu Izakaya."}
{"text":"I believe that 2.5 stars is less than this place deserves.  Let's cut to the chase.  One main dish - in our case korean style fried chicken, albeit boneless. Many side dishes, infinitely refillable. Specifically: infinite french fries and ketchup. and ... FIVE MOLSON BOTTLES.  $27.95.  You can't beat that, ok? It almost pays for itself based on the typical bar price of a Molson ($4-$5.) Everything on top of that is gravy.  Maybe there's other Korean bars to go to on this strip. Maybe I went to the wrong place. But so far, I'm happy with this place. You guys set a pretty damn high baseline."}
