{"text":"This is the best bbq I've ever had. The brisket melted on my tongue. It was so good I'm calling it my spot. The pit boss ted is a pro. Best beans. Get the beans!!!"}
{"text":"Travelling from out of town and wanted to try a nice little BBQ shop while here. WOW the service and food! A super friendly and clean little place to eat. I'll be returning here before I head home! 
Thanks for a great experience!"}
{"text":"Very good BBQ, I was hooked the first time, now I'm back once a week. Barbara the owner is very nice, and personable. I know you'll get what you pay for, and the taste on top is desert!"}
{"text":"This place is incredible tasty barbecue goodness in a clean place with plenty of seating. I'm definitely coming back. There's no wait! Stopped by little miss bbq for lunch and the line was tooooooo loooong! And the service is so friendly."}
{"text":"$7.99 for a sandwich, chips & a drink. I had the brisket & it was so so tasty! Can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"Spied this place driving by a few days ago and convinced co-workers to give it a try.  Very clean, SUPER nice people.  Food was very good and servings were generous.  I had the regular sized beef brisket sandwich and smoked beans.   I had the spicy bbq sauce.  Very good.  Neatly cut and stacked, fresh bun, and plenty of sauce.  Meat was the right amount of lean for my taste.  Parking is a squeeze, but worth the effort."}
{"text":"Good food and great service.  The friendliest folks around.  Stopped in for lunch and had the brisket platter.  Good flavor and liked the spicy sauce.  Definitely worth trying out if you've never been here."}
{"text":"Still wonderful! :-)  I eat at this BBQ restaurant every time I'm in this area.  Barbara and staff make sure your experience is wonderful and delicious :-)"}
{"text":"The place is clean and the lady is very nice..... That's where the positives end....

I had the half rack of ribs, with coleslaw and potato salad.

This is not BBQ, just meat cooked and drowned in sauce, no BBQ grill or smoking involved.....
I'm a bit of a rib snob, these were not good at all.......

At over $18 for the lunch, I expected really good and got well below average.

The flavor was not good, the Ribs were very fatty, but a fair portion of them...rated at 1 out of 5 stars.
The potato salad was more mashed potato than salad, I give it a 2 out of 5.
The coleslaw was ok, probably the best part of the meal, maybe a 3 out of 5.

The plasticware utensils were really cheap, disposable plate, no salt & pepper shakers on the table except the tiny packets (one each) in the baggy with the plasticware. If you are going to charge over $18 for a lunch..... FOR A LUNCH!!!!! .... at very least serve the lunch on a plate with silverware and have salt and pepper shakers on the table and have some better quality napkins for the \"BBQ\" sauce, I had to use 10 of the tiny cheapos......

I really hate wasting good money & time on a meal out and getting bland and subpar quality food.....  

I seem to be on a run of bad lunches lately...... maybe time to start packing lunch for a while....

Yeah, I would not recommend this place for the \"BBQ\" or potato ..... whatever it was, salad/mash. Peppersauce Caf√© is right across the street, has amazing service and food and for less money. I don't see this place staying in business long..."}
{"text":"I have wanted to stop at this place for the longest time but I always get there after 4! I made it, I wasn't even hungry but I couldn't help the BBQ. Their BBQ pork and sauce was delicious and huge! I should have tried their Cole slaw but I had the beans and it was a great decision."}
{"text":"Awesome BBQ. I had the beef brisket sandwich with regular bbq sauce. The brisket was shaved thin and the bbq sauce was perfect. Great price too."}
{"text":"This place is one of the Best BBQ joints in Phoenix!
Ted is one Polite gentlemen and will take first timers threw his Family Old recipes and tell you any Specials for the day. I had the Jumbo Brisket and Beans. The brisket was simply some one of the best I've had and served on a delicious white Roll. The Beans have chunks of meat in them with a lot of down Home flavor. Whatever which way you want it, Ted will serve it Up...!  Awesome place, with even better Food !!!   Great Homemade BBQ Sauce also.

*Take note Phoenix, Ted knows BBQ and Customer Service!"}
{"text":"not good...boiled meat drowning in sauce....odd potato salad...its mashed potatoes with some kind of sugary coating...good beans, decent sauce...threw 80% of the meal in the garbage"}
{"text":"This is simply horrible barbecue. They actually should not even tell people that they barbecue here because they just cook ribs and things in the oven and give you a whole bunch of sauce to cover it with.

I would highly recommend avoiding this place if you're looking for serious BBQ. I have heard that their sandwiches are decent"}
{"text":"Small business done right! The customer service alone is enough to make you feel like family. I was very impressed with attentiveness and personalized service I received.

The food is amazing! If you have a hard time narrowing down your choices.... go with BBQ Brisket and Beans! So amazing and will definitely be back."}
