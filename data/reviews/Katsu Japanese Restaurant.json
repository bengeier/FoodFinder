{"text":"The Edamame is one of my fave, simple dishes.  This one was very off coloured and did not taste even close to fresh.  As for the sushi, the rice was mushy.  They also gave us a wrong order, but it had pieces of sashimi that I did order, so I thought that was just a small mistake and so we ate it.  Then comes along our real order... At that point we were already full.  But the lady, who appeared to be the manager was very nice!  She greeted everyone kindly and offered a holiday house special sushi dish to every table and desserts (not sure if its part of the AYCE because its not on the menu).  However, it was difficult to get the staff's attention.  We asked for water and tea three times.  We didn't get it until we had been on our fourth dish."}
{"text":"Katsu is the fourth all-you-can-eat sushi place I've essayed around Toronto.  While I still like Yang's Sushi Bar in Mississauga the best, Katsu has given me two pleasantly surprising experiences, making it a contender in my books despite the fact that it's pretty far out of my way.  The first time, I went with a friend to get a late lunch.  While the food didn't stand out (I think I had a Bento box), the one thing that I remember was that the price was really good and the portions were quite substantial for a Japanese lunch.  The second time I went for all-you-can-eat dinner.  One big minus:  The order menu is a form you have to check yourself, and it contains ZERO information about which dish is what.  No pictures, no descriptions, just Japanese names.  I can never remember what all the names mean, so ordering was much more difficult than it should have been.  However, most of the food was quite satisfying.  It's not often that a cooked chicken dish at a Japanese place leaves an impression, but this one did, with one spice-rubbed chicken that had a great, unique flavour.  I couldn't even tell what it was except that it's much better than any chicken teriyaki I've ever had.  (Update:  It was the lemongrass chicken.)  The salmon and butterfish sashimi were both good, with larger pieces and a more pleasing colour (maybe fresher?) than most other places where I've ordered.  Katsu's sashimi and sushi choices are, unfortunately, smaller than other places -- no unagi sushi available, no salmon roe, no egg sushi -- but what I was able to get was good, and so was the price.  There is, apparently, a deluxe all-you-can-eat menu you can ask for, but I was satisfied with the regular menu.  One thing to watch out for is that this place offers pretty substantial portions of each item you get from the all-you-can-eat menu.  If you're used to the tiny little portions of each order you get at other places, you should start out conservative.  I've never had an all-you-can-eat sushi place where I didn't send through a second order form, but this place gave so much food on my first order that I actually had trouble finishing just the first order.  If you're the type who likes to sample lots of different items, you'll need to pare back your orders here."}
{"text":"I recently went to Katsu Sushi just after the dinner rush and the customer service was horrible. A woman with glasses and very broken English accused my friends of being underage saying she was going by a Japanese calculator (which makes no sense). After being corrected, another waiter told a friend of mine to spit out what she had because it wasn't a meal she had paid for.   Terrible service and terrible staff.  1/10"}
{"text":"I used to go to this restaurant very frequently and often took friends there too. No one was ever disappointed.  After a two year absence from Toronto, I went back last week. The food was even better than it was before. The choices have expanded. The service is excellent. The price is very reasonable for the amount, the quality and the choices provided. I didn't think it was possible, but the food is even better than it was two years ago."}
{"text":"I was there for dinner with a good friend who is used to eat sushi and we had some really marvelous sushi's and other things there. Very good food for fair prices! Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"Decided to try this place on a cold rainy day where the restaurant didn't seem that busy. The menu is quite extensive on the choices. You can have ayce or a la carte. We decided to do a la carte.  Ordered the scallops ($5.99). You get 5-6 scallops maybe a loonie size with garlic and some sauce. Not really worth the price.  Japanese Stuffed Mushroom with shrimp ($6.99). This one was not bad.It was different.  Beef Short Ribs ($5.99). You get 4 pieces and the flavour was not bad, but the short ribs had quite a bit of fat which I didn't prefer.   Sea Roll consisting of deep fried shrimp, cucumber, avocado, tobiko topped with unagi for the cost of $8.95. This one was alright as well.  Salmon Stoe (Crusted) salmon with egg sauce almond deep fried. For dinner you get two pieces. The price was $12.99, but you get that with bean sprouts, rice and soup salad thing.  Our server who is the only one working was attentive and the bill added fast with not too much food ordered. This place is alright, and it gets a pass for a next time come around in the neighbourhood."}
{"text":"Is this the best sushi in Toronto?  No.  But that's not why you're going here.  You're going here for the balance between decent sushi and an all you can eat menu that is satisfying even for groups where half of them hate raw fish.  The Deluxe menu is just ridiculous in terms of the variety and it's the perfect solution for my fiance and I.  I love sushi, he's not keen.  He loads up on chicken dishes and fried dumplings, while I devour hella sashimi and sushi until stuffed silly.  Recently, the service has improved and the quality of the fish as well.  Kudos."}
{"text":"Used to be a good place . I gave them a couple trys before review. But sorry. I cant stand with sticky rice and bad service at the same time. The only reason i gave it a one star would be nice salmon sashimi, thats it."}
{"text":"I love katsu! Great food, & prices... I usually go for all you can eat at lunch time."}
{"text":"This place is all right as far as sushi restaurants go.  Their ordering system is strange as for AYCE. You don't order by roll, but by piece. Very confusing.   Service is quick, however."}
{"text":"Been here about 3-4 times and have found it to be decent considering there aren't many AYCE joints in the area. Our most recent visit here (today) was a bit of a let down. New menu and ordering system which we're not fans of - instead of having a slip of paper to mark your order, you have to do it verbally. We were mostly annoyed by the One Direction playlist that continued throughout our meal - literally that is all that played! Overall, not bad if you just want AYCE sushi but not a top choice if you're willing to go elsewhere."}
{"text":"Pros: Good, reliable food and you can sit for what seems like hours just chatting after dinner. I'm a semi-regular. The AYCE dinner was quite good if you want variety.  Cons: Sometimes slow service and staff for whom English is a distant, distant second language. And the occasional wrong dish arrives."}
{"text":"This is hands down one of my top 3 favourite AYCE sushi spots in town. Been coming here for years now.    Quality - never had an issue. I'm a salmon sashimi guy, and it's always been fresh here. Their unagi and white tuna as well, though I stick more to salmon usually.   Variety - this is the only aspect where they don't shine as brightly, relative to some other AYCEs. In their defense, they do have very tasty kitchen dishes (i.e. the BBQ pork that my partner loves) and I've yet to dislike any of their stuff. Some AYCE places that emphasize their 100+ item menu often leave certain dishes lacking..   Service - hands down, this is where this location shines. The servers are always friendly, attentive, and pretty much never forgets an order item (a trait I wish all AYCEs would adopt). As well, they were always understanding of the *small* amount of food we left back. Another thing is that they are rarely packed - probably due to location, so kitchen service is rarely slow.   Ambience - relaxing music, soft lighting, random fake tree in the middle with stuffed monkeys hanging off (cute for the kids I guess). Good for a intimate date or a small group.    Came here for the non-AYCE lunch specials the other day - found out their makis were very nicely sized, did not skimp on the meat. Nom nom    Only complaint is that I wish they would open later and deliver farther.."}
{"text":"6:50: We were seated and given menus.   7:10: after waiting 20 minutes they took our drink and appetizer order. It is not busy.   7:15: the table next to us went inside to find their server. I overhear that they were chatting in the back not working. The customer was not happy. Not a good sign for our heroes...  7:22: Our drinks have arrived. Could this be some momentum???  7:28: our first item arrive. 4 carrot tempura. I'd thought we'd at least get the soup.   7:32: our apps arrive with our entrees. Whatever...I've sort of given up at this point.  7:47: Our server comes to check if we want more food.   My response?  \"We haven't gotten the rest of our food yet...\"  7:50: The rest of our food arrives. I then decide to order more.   8:01: All the second round orders come! Wow! This cancels out all the poor service beforehand (just kidding it doesn't). Maybe because we got a new server things became a little more efficient.   Note: We tipped 10%, which is crazy for me cause as a former server, I never tip lower than 15%. But considering the price of all you can eat ($23.99) and the really poor service, I really felt like we didn't get our money's worth.   Food was good but I felt like I was picking it apart out of frustration. Otherwise this would have been a 1 star rating."}
{"text":"Good for late night sushi since they are open till 11am. Good ambiance. Tried their Pan Fried Udon which was not that tasty. Their food quality lacked at the time of closing."}
{"text":"I had AYCE here. The prices were incorrect on the website. The food was OK ... good selection on the menu. Service was slow and impersonal.  I probably won't eat here again."}
{"text":"Used to be my fav all you can eat sushi place. Not any more.  Servers was friendly enough and service was with okay speed but quality of food wasnt good.  Wasn't busy lunch dinner time but rice in sushi was literally warm. all sushi was pretty much the same on taste. Difficult to eat,  some of them not properly rolled. The food on the nice full of picture menu is very different visually from the food on your table. Dinner wasn't worth it the money. I'm trying to add two pictures,  one of the role from menu and other what I get."}
{"text":"Katsu sushi was a great experience. The vibe of the restaurant is warm and clean. Fresh, tasty sushi rolls, hand rolls, special rolls (sea dragon) and sashimi. The rice is warm, which i enjoy but i know some people do not. Even the appetizers (seaweed salad and edamame) and the hot plates (beef teriyaki and vegetable tempura) were very yummy. The manager even came by with some special rolls as complimentary (even though we had chosen ayce) but they were wonderful and it was a nice touch. I personally didn't have a taste for their general tao chicken and the gyoza came out warm, but that is okay since we weren'tt technically paying for each plate at an ayce. Needless to say my boyfriend and I will return!"}
{"text":"I have heard only good things about Katsu. So finally during busy Easter Break it was my time to step my foot in there. It was quite busy around weekend dinner time, but quite empty afternoon, on our third visit. Menu was interesting and long. It took a moment to find what to order. We ordered one try of various goodies with maki and the other with sushi.   We were offered nice Miso soups and small salads before the trays arrived. The sushi tray came with nice piece of grilled salmon, stir-fry and a pile of rice. Tempura of veggies and shrimps were so good, that I feel drooling now, while thinking of that visit to Katsu....Food was nicely cooked, flavourful and definitely too much for us, so we both ended up taking little baggies home.   Server was fast, attentive and flexible, so our food arrived fast, water glasses were never empty. All in all a success. When you are on Danforth, make a stop and enjoy authentic Japanese cuisine.  Btw, if your tray comes with dumpling and you are a vegetarian, please ask them to subtitute with spring roll. On our third visit we overlooked that fact and ended up getting pork dumplings..."}
{"text":"Katsu has great sushi at a reasonable price. The restaurant itself is very upper class and inviting. The staff is friendly and prompt. I've had sushi at several other places and katsu is still my favourite. One can actually taste the fish in the sushi at katsu vs just the kelp and rice from other places. I also enjoy seeing generous portions of roe in my sushi."}
{"text":"The last time I went here (a few years ago) a group of friends and I were eating and a cockroach fell from the ceiling onto the middle of the table. (NOT KIDDING).   Fresh Fish should not be $10 AYCE at all. Avoid."}
{"text":"I use to go here all the time but I don't think I will be returning. I don't understand what changed, the food I previously had was great. I went for lunch for the all-you-can-eat and got the teriyaki beef (pretty good) and sushi. I ordered the salmon and butter fish. I've had these before and they were good but today they weren't. The outside of the fish was slimy and the inside had ice, also tasted very fishy. So the fish is previously frozen. Also I saw the guy at the sushi counter lifting semi frozen sides of salmon and squeezing water out of them. Was so turned off by watching him. Quite disappointing overall."}
{"text":"Favorite sushi spot! Love the manager, she is very friendly. Staff is always great. Food is always great. New renovtion makes the place look great."}
{"text":"Good: Price of AYCE was reasonable  Bad: The sushi was jam packed with rice, I seems like every time I come here they pack in more rice. It was basically 90% rice with paper thin fish. The fish was not fresh either. The rolls were equally jammed packed with rice. We decided not to eat any of it and just create a big pile of rice.  Abysmal: Service was horrible. Actually it was the short hair asian lady, every time we come she looks like she is pissed off at something. We ask her about the menu because the Udon dish was lacking and she answers in a way that is incredibly disrespectful to the customers. She eyes the table like a hawk because we have one in the party that didn't order AYCE. She constantly comes to remind us that we can not share (which we never did). Freaken bad attitude. When we leave, we walk past her she doesn't blink an eye and say anything.    Crap service, crap food, okay price. Not worth it. This is the last time we come here."}
{"text":"Heres the thing, Katsu has a small AYCE sushi menu but its all pretty good.  The atmosphere of the place is good, the food is great and the fact that I can get AYCE sashimi for less than $15 is awesome.  While the menu doesnt have as many items as some other AYCE sushi joints it still has many stand out items.  I have been to half a dozen sushi joints in Toronto so far and this is still probably my favourite."}
{"text":"Yesterday, I went there for the first time. Before I started writing these reviews, I was very surprised how bad services other people had. On the contrary, I had quite a good experience there. I ordered Shioramen. Noodle was excellent, chashu (pork) were excellent, eggs and soup were tasty. My friend ordered Katsudon and I had a little bit. We thought the rice was just right, and Katsu(Fried pork) was tasty. My friend said onions on the top were very good. I did not order Sushi, though. Tables and seats are comfortable with good spaces.  Try Katsudon or Shioramen!"}
{"text":"I think service wins in this restaurant more than anything. I had the Haru Combo and I felt the quantity was well worth the money. The Tempura was average, the sushi was as expected and the salad could have been better. The miso soup is always simplicity at its best. Since I had the vegetarian sushi I don't think I can really say much regarding the quality or flavor of them. They were decent. The restaurant offered our group witt complimentary deserts which was a cherry on the top of the great service they provided."}
{"text":"We go to Katsu once every couple of weeks and always have a great time. The price, food and service are always on point. We usually have the same waitress and she has gotten to know our family and is always very sweet to our son. No complaints here!"}
{"text":"Normally I give a review after giving places a second chance, but there are other AYCE places in this area which I will have to try as well, but I'm pretty sure they'll be better than this place.   I came here a bit more than an hour before they were going to close, but the server was telling me I have to order everything now and I won't be able to order more later... bummer. Problem is, I ordered my food and it took a bit more than half an hour to get to me. Meanwhile, my partner got their appetizer and sashimi 10-15 mins before me.   It was ineffective to see that they only had one person manning the fish counter for all these orders, they would need at least 2 people no matter the capacity of the place. I would have been OK with food that took a long time to come, but honestly, it was not fresh and did NOT look at all like the pictures on the menu, and for that price (~25 AYCE), it was overall not good.   I got a red dragon and I was expecting thick rolls with a nice bed of roe on top, but instead I got meek rolls, thinly riced, kind of clumsily put together, and barely some roe sparingly sprinkled on top, they cheaped out. It tasted fine but I know I could have gotten much better. I ordered some BBQ pork as well, it was disgusting. It tasted overcooked and the sauce/texture felt tarry and unhealthy (almost burnt). I also had a sushi pizza and it wasn't good either, the panko crust was mushy, the toppings were uninteresting and it just lacked soul.  I went to this place because it was open later than the other sushi joints around, but honestly it's not more convenient or anything. I will try the other places, but I don't think I'll be coming back here on purpose unless I'm desperate enough and willing to give them another chance. Maybe it was the time of day, but I don't that's an excuse for serving unfresh/mushy/soulless food."}
{"text":"I've been here twice, and the first time was okay for all you can eat. This second time was AWFUL. So bad, I won't be coming back to ever spend money there.   It was actually a struggle to eat the sushi we got for the all-you-can-eat lunch and between 2 people we got 3 rolls so that's nothing. We had an avocado salmon roll and the salmon was so light in colour and also so white. The size of the avocado was the tiniest little thing ever. All rolls we had were essentially rice mashed together with a sliver of whatever was inside as they were poorly wrapped.   My favourite thing to see was that we ordered a garden salad and a mixed vegetable stir fry and they were the exact same thing except the salad was heated and had teriyaki sauce dumped on top."}
{"text":"EDIT: Got the sushi because it was the first restaurant open in the neighborhood on a Sunday and I needed a quick lunch. Really, really bad idea because I got serious food poisoning after, to the point where I had to go to bed with aches and a fever. Spare yourself and don't go here.   Wanted sushi but decided to give the ramen a try. What a mistake. It took forever to come and when it did come, it was barely edible.   Noodles were soggy and overcooked, and the broth was basically salted water. I ordered the shio ramen but it was not pork bone soup by any standard. This restaurant should really just stick to trying to get their sushi right, which as apparent from the reviews, they are having some issues with.   I was really hungry so I ate a third of it before I could eat anymore, but if I hadn't, I would have sent it back. That's how pissed I was at this audacious attempt to pass out crap as ramen."}
{"text":"It's a mix. We had the all you can eat on a Friday, i.e., a more expensive night for it. Everything was decent. Hot and sour soup was exactly that and really hit the spot where I was suffering a cold at the time. All the rolls were decent, not exceptional but nothing wrong with them either. Except the ones with spicy mayo; they really should ease up on the mayo there. My girlfriend and I both had to gag a couple of those down and it was probably the only item we couldn't finish. Would I go back? Probably, but it's not a guarantee. There are other all you can eat sushi places in Toronto and this one is nothing fabulous."}
{"text":"I had AYCE sushi with a bunch of friends on a Sunday night. The place wasn't very busy at all so I expected a half decent service. What I got was the worst service that I have ever had in Toronto. Seated at 6:50, drinks were taken at 7:15, food order at 7:20. We never got the food till about 8:00, and it was incomplete, we were missing a few dishes. No big deal it's AYCE we can order it again; so we did. The next food order took another half hour to get to our table again incomplete. They ignored our table for a while, asked for water refills etc. They never came. The food was average, I didn't really expect much. I would never recommend this place to anyone at all. I'm not really one to write restaurant reviews. This time I had to sign up just to write this."}
{"text":"Took my mom for her birthday here they treat us like s*** and circus the same thing. The manager was rude and also very poor at English. I ordered a roll that tasted awful that I couldn't eat and they force me to pay for it and I kept emphasizing how awful it was and they kept telling me I was wrong. I would recommend not going to this restaurant in fact I recommend calling the health inspector because their food is dried out and old I would say it was left over from the day before and don't go here you get what you pay for $11.99 all you can eat."}
{"text":"I have been here two times already, in the last 30 days. I came during lunch time, but in both times I ordered the dinner all-you-can-eat menu, as I really like sashimi.  As a Brazilian, I could find it a difficult experience, as sometimes japanese restaurants come with that \"dragon\" spicy sauce, which kind of upsets brazilians, not used to too much spice in their meals.  But this restaurant, in my opinion, is above average. Sushi's great, sashimi is great, the rolls are awesome, miso soup is ok, curries and grilled meals were amazing.  I'll return many times."}
{"text":"I've been to Katsu a few times and each time it's been delicious! I've eaten there with several different people and none of them ever had anything negative to say about the food. I'm not a sushi connoisseur, but I do go for sushi a few times a month...I like to think I'm qualified to say Katsu makes a mean rainbow roll! Although they have a pretty good selection for dinner, a few more combo/single platter options would be nice; regardless, you still have lots to choose from.  The atmosphere is relaxed but it still has a slightly \"elegant\" feel. And perhaps most importantly, it seems very clean!   As someone else mentioned, the service does leave something to be desired. Every time I've been I've had to wait too long for either food or the bill. On the plus side, they usually bring a complimentary appetizer or some sort of coupon to make up for it.    Sounds like the all-you-can-eat lunch is where it's at...I'll have to hit that up!"}
{"text":"Probably one of the better AYCE places in the Danforth area and for a reasonable price. Been here a couple times and the service was quick and friendly on both occasions.  The quality of their seafood is quite good as well. If you're ordering from the AYCE menu they have a smaller and more standard selection of sushi, sashimi and hand rolls. They do have a much larger selection of rolls. My fav is anything with avocado and Unagi (eel). Their hot and sour soup is quite good as is the ramen broth. They make the broth fresh every day and it was a really nice flavour to it. Dinner AYCE prices range around $20-25 depending on if it's a weekday or weekend."}
{"text":"I came here because the price seemed to good to be true and as usual it was...  The all you can eat was terrible. The sushi was loosely wrapped and the meats were all gristly. I tried getting some chicken and ended up leaving so much of it on the plate that I was worried they were going to try and charge me for it (this was their policy on the menu that it said they charged you for uneaten food) but it didn't happen.  I'm all for being thrifty but I'd never every go back to this place again."}
{"text":"This place is alright. Katsu used to be the first and one of the only Japanese restaurants in Greektown a few years back. When that was my only option, this place was pretty good. They have an a la carte menu as well as an AYCE option. I've only ever really gone for the AYCE.  First thing I like about this place: it's pretty cheap, but you do get what you pay for.   They NEVER overkill on the avocado, as far as I can recall, but the sushi never really tastes that fresh. I know it might be too much to ask from an AYCE joint, but I've tasted better quality at other AYCE places.   The tempura items on the AYCE menu come out pretty fast, but they are SUPER oily. I like the light, crispy texture of tempura, but I feel like Katsu produces really oily and heavy tempura items.   The servers are okay. They're not jumping up and down to help you, but they're also not rude (which is pretty common in many AYCE places). This place has really died down over the years so if you're really that hungry, this might be your place to go since you'll get pretty fast and prompt service."}
{"text":"Does not deserve even one star Sashimi not fresh Washabi powder mixed with too much water Could hardly taste the washibi taste ( total asked for three scoops of washibi, but still did not get to taste the washibi)  Temperua..WTH..the worst I have ever tasted  Will not visit again thumbs down"}
{"text":"What a decline in everything. They stopped producing anything fresh, the shrimp tempura had obviously been microwaved and the sushi was god awful. I used to go all the time, I'd never return again. They also go rid of the checklist for AYCE and the server has to try and remember everything you want. Super crappy, she couldn't remember half of the stuff we wanted but I don't blame her."}
{"text":"After reading some of the reviews on Katsu I am amazed that my personal experience mirrors that of many.  Like others Katsu was one of my first sushi experiences and I absolutely loved it! yet as the years passed and I started to gain a mild proficiency in the ways of the sushi, I started to realize that Katsu had strayed or had it always strayed and I had simply been the last to know.   Maybe I simply lacked insight or the depth of knowledge needed to see its foibles, yet they did become glaringly obvious as my relationship with sushi grew.  On the plus side Katsu is clean, spacious and conveniently located on the vibrant Danforth and although the service can nicely be characterized as \"no frills,\" it is blazing fast.  And the Miso salad offers a satisfying crunch and could possibly be the most addictive item on the menu.    For a low-mid range all you can eat sushi joint Katsu is passable, yet for those equipped with a greater sushi appreciation you may be a tad more judgmental."}
{"text":"I decided to venture out of my comfort downtown zone, take my mommy's advice and troll the Danforth. I've had a sushi craving for all of November so my date and I decided to stop here for dinner.  I'm pretty sleepy so I'll try to make this short. The interior was pretty and clean. I love the decor, it was like modern Japan at twilight. The service wasn't  always the greatest but I like that I can basically flag down anyone to order. The all you can eat was delicious; not much variety but still good enough. I love how quickly the food came out. They sometimes forgot parts of what we ordered but, when reminded, the food came quickly. I loved the shrimp tempura roll & the spicy salmon roll..so much so that I'll probably be dreaming about them tonight--dreaming of food over my date is big! :)"}
{"text":"Nice. relaxing atmosphere.  There are some booths in the back.  The baked mushrooms came in tin foil which was a little odd but they were tasty.  I highly recommend their ginger ice cream though....it's soooo creamy and has pieces of ginger!"}
{"text":"Popped in for dinner last night. I was a little wary, as I do not eat most fish, but they had lots of chicken dishes.  At first I had planned on ordering a bento box from the regular menu, but after comparing the price to the All You Can Eat menu, it made sense to get the AYCE.  I was a little worried that they might be slow based on other reviews here, but they were quick, and friendly too. I will certainly be back, my only criticism of this place is that they should have offered the white guy a fork instead of chop sticks lol (I was spearing most things)."}
{"text":"Been here a few times and it is usually good.  However more recently I went on a busy evening and the service was terrible and the sushi was not very appetizing."}
{"text":"AYCE sushi at an affordable price. Menu was recently revamped and I've been their for both lunch and dinner.  The lunch AYCE at Katsu wasn't the greatest, menu quite limited and nothing close to the full dinner menu.  The dinner AYCE is worth the money. Sushi and sashimi are fresh and a good selection. There are lots of varieties of tempura, soups noodles, rice and meat dishes.  I have found some of their chicken dishes a bit over done/ over fried an didn't enjoy them. Sushi and sashimi is generally quite enjoyable and tasty.  I would recommend their dinner menu but not the lunch AYCE, instead you can opt for their lunch specials which are worth the money."}
{"text":"I really like this place- they let us do half the table all you can eat, half order off the menu- so impressed with their flexibility - the cooked stuff in the all you can eat is so good- the garlic beef was AMAZING. Sashimi was excellent.  - pretty standard prices for all you can eat, good service."}
{"text":"I went for AYCE dinner. The standard menu is $16.99 and it is the size of $12 lunch menus elsewhere. The deluxe AYCE dinner is $21.99 (I got that) and still less selection than dinner options elsewhere. No saba. No tamago. No inari. Booo. The a la carte prices I saw on the menu are a little higher than the quality of the food as well. The food was edible but not good. The sushi rice was hot which always upsets me. The \"general chicken\" which I take to be a relative of general tao was gross, don't bother. The salmon and snapper were fresh. The sushi pizza lacked eel sauce but still tasted ok. The yam tempura didn't taste clean. Maybe the oil needed to be changed. The sesame ball for dessert was over cooked and the green tea ice cream was covered in chocolate sauce for some unknown reason. The only thing I'd crave from here is the cheese wontons but they are the same as everywhere else, nothing different. One last gripe about the selection, their website is somewhat misleading stating:  \"Our \"All you can eat\" really means all you can eat. At Katsu, you can eat anything we serve at an incredible value.\" Makes one think if it's in the a la carte it should be in the AYCE menu.   The service was a mess. I was served by four different individuals in the course of one meal. Not one of them ever smiled. I'm from the east coast so I say \"thank you\" every time something is delivered to the table, none of them ever said\" you're welcome\" or acknowledged I had said anything. Three of the four mumbled instead of speaking clearly so I had to ask them to repeat everything they said. Water was slow to be filled. I was still waiting on a chicken dish and dessert and the bill was dropped on my table. No explanation was given for any plate as it was plunked on the table. The place needs a manager or some sort of table designation system because the frantic running around to random tables isn't cutting it. The servers were all efficient and not overtly rude, but they certainly didn't add anything to the experience. I won't go back."}
{"text":"my 15 year old son and i went for an ayce lunch. we have been regulars for about 2 months for suppers mostly but school is out so we went for lunch.  all was good. until we got the bill - our $14.99 per person ayce lunch became a $24.99 ayce lunch because unknowingly we ordered from the only menu provided - the dinner menu!  what should have been a $35 meal became a $56 dollar meal - for lunch.  every other table had a lunch menu but us - how am i supposed to know which is lunch and which is dinner when we never even received the lunch menu at all. the restaurant could not have cared less. your mistake - you pay.  well the $25 we were overcharged will come back on them. the birthday party that was supposed to be catered by katsu 2 weekends from now - no way.  i figured in the few months we were going to katsu for a couple of times a week was in excess of a couple of hundred dollars - no more.  bunch of jerks who have zero idea of customer service. a simple apology, some  recognition of their liability in this would have kept us happy.  i guess now we will try the other 8 sushie places within 10 minutes of us."}
{"text":"This place has been a staple on the Danforth for many many years.  I came here with 3 friends for dinner.  The decor and atmosphere of the place is nice and pleasing.  The AYCE menus offer a decent selection of expected hot items such as beef & salmon teriyaki, a small selection of udon, tempura, miso soup, etc.  While the sushi choices were the standard sashimi (salmon, white tuna, yellowtail, etc) and rolls (dragon, rainbow, unagi, etc).  There is a two-hour dine-in time limit but that isn't a surprise to any AYCE'er.  Everything tasted satisfying but nothing really stood out compared to some of the other AYCE places.  We all felt satisfied after the meal with nary a feeling of hunger remaining.  We went on a weekday where I felt the price was more competitive and got great service."}
{"text":"Slow service. The hot food was ok nothing special. The sushi was very good. The servers need more training in every single way you can imagine. My girl had no problems this time I guess im the crazy this time. ;)"}
{"text":"This place is a joke. We went there around 10 pm. I was worried if it was too late but we were seated and the waiter took our AYCE sushi order. We also ordered some wings and teriyaki stuff as appetizer. Appetizers came so fast but we were still waiting for our sushi.After around 20 mins wait, I called for our waiter and asked if our sushi order was coming. The answer was no because AYCE sushi bar was closed. I told him that he should have warned me when we ordered AYCE sushi. That was all I told him and this guy went crazy and started yelling at me in Chinese. Thanks god some lady came up, i suppose she was the manager, apologized for what just happened."}
{"text":"This is probably shitty sushi place in the city. Everything was extremely bad. Don't ruin your mean with this crappy restaurant."}
{"text":"Its a struggle getting AYCE with any degree of rapidity. The price is right, the food OK, but during the day the selection is scanty. But they have a price to meet and that is understandable. The sushi 'rolling' is terribly slow. I would still be waiting for my income tax return for next year for my 3rd order. But I guess you get what you pay for.  For $10.00."}
{"text":"I've been to Katsu Sushi many times in the last two years, and it seems to get better and better every time I go.   Great options on the AYCE menu, including an incredible ramen. The maki rolls are expertly prepared.. just the perfect filling to rice ratio (other all you can eat places tend to overdo it with the rice so that you're not getting enough fish/other ingredients). The sashimi was perfectly cut.. well sized, evenly cut slices.    On earlier visits, the service was lacking.. but yesterday we were really impressed by the attentiveness of the staff.  It was really excellent.   This is hands down my favorites spot for AYCE. I can't say enough great things about this place!"}
{"text":"I'm making it my goal to review all the more cheaper ayce sushis.  Anyway, I came in on a Tuesday evening (24.99). It wasn't super busy. Service was pretty good. The place was dim, clean, no complaints.  And then the food happened.  To be honest, all the sushi and sashimi I had were very solid. They weren't amazing quality, but its a solid good quality and that's all I can really ask for.  The problem I had is the portion size and beef tataki (how do you screw up raw beef? Its raw beef?????). One roll had 10 pieces. As well, ayce sushi places let's you order 1 piece at a time but not here for most things.   I had issues with the beef tataki. Yes I said it already but its sour with the veggies (why?) and idk if it's actually beef.  I also ordered chicken and short ribs. They weren't bad but the sauce is greasy and heavy and leaves a bad taste in my mouth despite its initial tastiness .  Dessert.... Creme brulé tasted eggy. Ginger ice cream is a lot better than I would expect it to be. The red bean ice cream has actual red beans in it so that's always good.  Overall, I wouldn't come here if you wanted to come alone. If you're coming with company, this isn't a bad spot to check out. I'd give this place a 3.5 but yeah. 4 stars it is."}
{"text":"I have enough experience with this place to write a fair review. When I moved to Toronto I lived on the east end so I would go here approx. once per month (when I did my banking) because I liked getting work done over their WiFi while eating at a nice pace at a reasonable price. Today I returned after about a full year since I moved to the west end and will definitely be my last time. Here's how they've gone majorly down hill:   -First of all, the place was empty... Nothing to complain about but their service should have been fine and the fact that it's empty now (appose to a year ago), says it all.  -So they removed some items from the lunch menu, fair enough, they need to make money.  -On top of that, as I was ordering she mentioned 'last call for lunch' it was only half past 2pm -- so I had to order everything at once, which was a reasonable few rolls, soul, etc.   -When I asked for their WiFi password they said their WiFi was down-- then after I looked visably annoyed that I sat down and ordered just to not get any work done she gave me the password -- so, she just lied to me.  -They gave off a vibe that they just didn't want to be there. Fair enough, I've worked some shitty service jobs but it shows that they aren't paid well at all. -The real kicker was when not all of my food showed up and I asked about it, she said I didn't order it etc.  I didn't make a huge deal about it, but it was before 3PM and she said I couldn't order again. So I ended up paying 20$ (I did give a few $ tip regardless) and I had 2 small roles.  I guess that's average price for sushi, but they definitely shouldn't advertise all you can eat. It's the fact that I was lied to multiple times I did feel 'cheated' and left feeling over all that the place must be struggling. Good luck giving it a try, they really need to do something about their customer service and they can get back to where they once were. Cheers."}
{"text":"After the raving reviews here, I decided to give Katsu a try. I would have never looked twice at this place if I were simply passing by. A Japanese resto on the Danforth? Yeah, I bet it would be awesome.   But awesome it was. I came here this weekend for All you can eat lunch ($11, what a deal). The menu was very skimpy, but this turns out to completely work in your favour, since everything tastes fresh.  The staff is very, very mobile, always filling glasses, taking away places, and definitely *Not* ignoring orders, as some AYCE sushi places are notorious for.   My favourite dishes were the spicy chicken and the tempura, as far as the sushi is concerned I loved the Spicy Salmon rolls. The drawback was the mayo in the rolls, but I wonder if they would take a request to let the mayo go AWOL every now and then?  2.5 Stars."}
{"text":"*2.5 stars* Was here last night.   (Mostly b/c they had seats available on their \"patio\".  We went with the deluxe AYCE menu, at $21.99 per person.  It's a reasonable value b/c they offer many of their specialty $8 and $9 rolls on the AYCE menu.  A few notes, the service was particularly slow, and they kitchen was EXTREMELY slow when it came to serving the sashimi we ordered, but amazingly quick when it came to teriyaki.  I'm super unimpressed by that.  It should take way less time to slice some raw fish than to cook beef.  Our server was nice, but took forever to bring food, to bring drinks (water), and to bring the bill.  I don't think I'll go back.  The quality of the food was ok.  And, when the sashimi came, I must say that it was the thinnest, tiniest pieces of sashimi even known to mankind - b/c of that this place is a pass.  Or maybe next time I'll have to strategically order sashimi only for the first little while, then move on to the rest of the menu."}
{"text":"A good looking and clean restaurant but servers that need more training and poor food quality.   Came here for AYCE dinner with a family of 4. I say servers need more training because there was no front of house. We stood around clueless for the first 5 minutes. After being seated we had to wait another 5 minutes for menus and were not given tea/water until we asked. Our edamame also arrived after our sushi... Otherwise servers were very friendly and seemed genuinely happy to be working.  Food quality: Spicy salmon roll was not spicy at all. Fresh salmon sashimi, but seemingly old white tuna. Avoid all fried rice, udon and ramen because they're all way too salty.   Lastly, you'd think that at an AYCE sushi place they would give you AYCE ice cream... But you're limited to one scoop per person.   Overall, if you're looking for quality sushi, don't go to the danforth."}
{"text":"Best sushi place on the Danforth.Chin the manager welcome to you and ensures that all you need are met. Staff are polite and attentive. Oh, let's not forget the food; it is delicious."}
{"text":"The salmon sushi and salmon rolls were great. Very fresh. The spicy tuna roll not so great. Not really spicy. Unless by spicy you mean crunchy. Avoid that. But go for the squid tempura on the non sushi side.  One trick to watch for here. Everything is a piece, including the rolls. If you put 1 next to, say, California Roll, you will get one piece/slice of the roll. You won't get a whole roll sliced into 6.   Really spacious restaurant and good service."}
{"text":"My husband and I went out for a date night without the kids. Since we are both sushi lovers, we decided to give Katsu a try. Boy, was that a mistake. Their rolls were mediocre at best. Gummy, cold rice. The spicy salmon was nowhere near spicy. The Dynamite Roll was anything but. The hot food was even worse. The Chicken Karage was the most dry, burnt chicken I have ever had the misfortune to taste. The shrimp rolls were like biting into grease rolls. I like deep fried. It takes a lot of grease to turn my stomach, but Katsu managed in spades. Save yourself the indigestion. Skip Katsu."}
{"text":"Very disappointing.  They had a very small AYCE menu (the manager said it is 'temporary') while still charging full price.  Not cool.  It is not that we weren't full by the end, but one goes to AYCE places so one can taste a myriad of different things that one usually does not order.    The manager offered free dessert, so that was cool (but isn't dessert supposed to be included in AYCE??).  The quality of the fish in the sushi was not the greatest.  Haven't been back since."}
{"text":"So I read all of these reviews on Katsu before I went here with 4 friends and contrary to what other Yelpers say, I found this place pretty good but I do have some complaints, very few.  Pros: - Affordable price for AYCE Lunch, cheaper than most places - Staff was tentative and helpful - Food came out within 5 minutes - Sushi was fresh, good filling to rice ratio (there was more filling than rice so IDK what other people were complaining about TOO much rice) - Good selection of food (A la carte menu) and drinks - Takeout price for remaining food was good. $8 takeout for 15 pieces of uneaten sushi and deep fried items is fairly good   Cons: - Drinks did take too long to come out, the place was like 25% full - Limited selection of menu items (AYCE menu)  - A menu item was sent to our table when we clearly didn't order it - Did get very loud near the middle of our meal when the Greektown parade goers came flooding, made it difficult to request/ask stuff to the waiters.  Overall experience was really good, would recommend this place to others if we wanted cheap affordable AYCE sushi. Downtown is good too but some places are expensive."}
{"text":"WOW! $10 all-you-can-eat sushi for lunch or $17 for dinner, what a deal.  Sure the menu is limited for the all-you-can-eat but the selections are great.  The staff is fairly friendly, not top-notch service but good enough.  The decor is modern and the place is clean.  I've been here a handful of times and never had a bad experience.  Skip the tempura tofu but definitely get the tempura veggies."}
{"text":"We went there once for sushis. It was OK. But the Ramen noodle soup is disgusting. The broth is watery, the noodles have no flavor. Don't order that."}
{"text":"Arrived on Saturday evening and restaurant was pretty empty. Nice looking decor. Service was fair as they kept refilling our cups. Food was lacking as the Maki rolls were made with white sticking rice, so when I took the first bite it get stuck on upper mouth and immediately had to wash it down with water. White tuna was not fresh and tasted very fishy and rubbery. I ordered the crispy sesame balls but it never came after requesting it again the second time.   Overall service was fair so I still tipped for the service but food quality is still lacking. Will I return? not likely"}
{"text":"You can't beat the value here, I come once a week. The rice is well cooked and fish is fresh. It's a very extensive menu too.  They have tempura shrimp which is pretty rare at this price. As well as dragon rolls. my favorite though is the spicy avocado rolls. some how the avocado is always perfect. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"Katsu was where I was first introduced to sushi.  I used to go here for their cheap lunch sushi buffets.  It's a great place to try sushi if all you've never tried sushi before or if you're used to eating the stuff that's pre-packaged.  However, if you've eaten quality sushi before, this place is just mediocre.  The sushi doesn't always seem as fresh as it could be, and you mainly fill up on the rice that's in the rolls and on the bottom of the sushi. (There's an extra charge of $0.50 if you leave the rice).  There's so much rice as a filler at this place, and their shrimp tempura seems like it's triple battered - so you get full really quickily.  There's no really exotic rolls at this place, just your standard stuff.  The service is really bad, the girls don't seem like they want to help you and my brother and his friends have said that they got chased down for not tipping enough here.  If I wanted a sushi buffet on a budget I'd go here, but really,  if I'm on a budget I'd just do a la carte at a different place."}
{"text":"Katsu is my go-to sushi place, based mainly on the cheap all-you-can eat prices (I only eat AYCE here.)  I find the sushi is always fresh because it's made to order.  Even when it's really busy, you don't have to wait long.  I like the selection they have, from sushi to \"kitchen\" items (salad, chicken etc.)  I also like that the servers are always nice.  I'm taking off one star because they've raised their prices by $2 or so because they've changed the menu, but the only \"new\" thing I like it the golden dragon roll."}
{"text":"I came here with middling expectations given the reviews posted on Yelp so far, but I would have to say that I was surprised...in a good way!   WARM RICE! NON-FROZEN FISH (even soft!)! RATIO OF RICE TO FISH IN ROLLS (do you know the pain of getting a sushi roll where the rice layer is almost as thick as the fish? I'm looking at you unnamed sushi restaurant with tablets at Yonge Dundas theatre)! The points I mentioned seem kind of basic, but you kind of appreciate it when a lot of restaurants at a higher price point in Toronto don't even do that. Atmosphere, price, and food are all good.   10/10 would come back.  Side note, our server was also real nice."}
{"text":"Excellent variety and great food! Had the AYCE sushi and I couldn't have had a better date night.  Menu and orders are done by iPad, servers are polite and attentive and staff are generally friendly and inviting!"}
{"text":"Katsu Sushi is the place to go for Sushi in Greek Town. It's clean, comfortable, the staff are friendly, the food is fresh, as a matter of fact really damn good and always arrives at the table in a timely manner. My wife and I met here for the first time on our first date, and we spent three and a half comfortable hours chatting in a booth. It's too bad they have only 4 booths in the diningroom. The rest of the seating in the diningroom is typical chairs and tables, nothing too fancy, but comfortable as well. Those booths though are 5/5 stars. My only complaint about Katsu is that the furniture on their small front outdoor patio could be more eloquent. Plastic chairs and tables seem to detract from what is otherwise a tasteful, comfortable, and overall good sushi experience.  This place is about a 5-10 min walk west of Pape on the North side of Danforth. There's street parking all around the Danforth, and a local green P. Parking is tough in this neighbourhood as its so busy so walking it, or riding the rocket (local transit aka TTC - bus/subway) might be a better suited choice of travel.  Eating here, will leave you full and happy."}
{"text":"VIBE  It's nothing special but lots of booths. Me likey!  Staff are QUICK and friendly.   I ATE  Spicy tuna with tempura bits. I love that they put the tempura bits in the sushi. Nommm! Again, the food is fresh and it comes out Quick! Plus, it's cheap! I paid $6! Done and done.   OBLIGATORY CATCHY REMARK  Quick, fresh, fast. Great if you're in a group."}
{"text":"Food poisoning - stay away - this place is not clean - it's consistently a bad experience"}
{"text":"Katsu was the first AYCE Sushi place I tried when I moved to Toronto and as a result, my feelings about this place have changed a lot over time.  On a positive note, I would say that the sushi is good and fresh. The service is generally fast and the staff is friendly.  In comparison to other sushi places I've gone to I would say that their rolls have WAY too much rice in them. Their overall lunch selection is very bare bones and they don't have many specialty rolls on their AYCE menu (lunch or dinner)."}
{"text":"Right off the bat, their AYCE menu is lacking in variety. This is the first sushi restaurant I have been to that doesn't offer shrimp tempura or seaweed salad on their lunch AYCE menu. They also use way too much rice for their sushi rolls which creates an unpleasant, sticky and wet texture. Expect to be full after only 3 pieces.  The only thing I would recommend is the chicken udon noodles. It's a nice restaurant right on the danforth but as for the quality, I probably won't be coming back."}
{"text":"BEWARE OF SERVICE!  The waitress with glasses kept on arguing about our age and could not serve us (we were born in 1994) because she thinks we are under the age limit and a young male waiter was very disrespectful to us where at one point in time told one of us to \"chill out!\" and walked away.  TERRIBLE CUSTOMER SERVICE!!"}
{"text":"Last night while shopping on the Danforth we stopped in at Katsu for dinner. The place is on the south side of the street and split into two separate sections. The front facing on to Danforth while the back which is raised has a pretty little closed courtyard with a tree. That's right a skylight and a tree in the middle of the restaurant. It adds a bit of unexpected lightness that is nice.   They have an extensive menu of sushi and Japanese specialities. Everything you would expect from a Toronto sushi place and AYCE. We opted for a selection of appetizers and hand rolls and everything was beautifully plated and delicious. The place was busy and while the service was a little slow, they tried their best to ensure it was a pleasant experience."}
