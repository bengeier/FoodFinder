{"text":"They serve really yummy House Special Angel Hair Noodles! If you haven't tried this family run short order Chinese restaurant you should definitely give it a shot. The service is fast and they will also deliver if you live nearby. As far as food goes I've never been unsatisfied with their dishes.  My favorites are Pot Stickers, Mongolian Beef, and of course House Special Angel Hair Noodles."}
{"text":"This has been our go to place for carry out. The food is ok but I knock it down a star because I like the spicy option & even when I am there in person & ask for spicy they don't come through. Don't put the red star or whatever if you are going to be timid with the chiles."}
{"text":"First, I have to admit that this is a regular stop on the way home, perhaps because it is one of the best take-out places on the way home. Don't expect Golden Harbor, but it is good and affordable. Prices have risen recently, but still quite reasonable. There are better take-out places in CU, but this one has a great location and has a wonderful staff who treat us like family and are always happy, friendly, and efficient,   They have some excellent soups. My personal favorites are the seafood soup and the house special soup (a seafood, pork, veggie soup).  My wife appreciates that they have the usual \"diet menu\" of steamed veggie dishes-- not authentic, but tasty enough if you use the garlic sauce), and my kids love the noodle dishes.    The menu is rather large, but in a way quite limited. \"Seafood\" dishes, for example, are almost exclusively shrimp. They have one or two scallop dishes and one or two fried fish dishes.  Not being a fan of shrimp, I find this a big limitation.  The fried fish dishes are quite good, but I'd like it better if they also had some squid, octopus, jellyfish, etc., or even more fried (or steamed? or broiled?) fish options.  Everything here is tasty. I do like the bbq ribs and the pot stickers very much.    Like most CU Chinese take out, this is not a place to go for ambience.  They have a few tables-- basic chairs and formica tops-- like many other places. They have free tea and water for dine-in, and they have a cooler full of soft drinks for purchase.  But we usually take it home,  On rare occasion when they've gotten the order wrong, we simply tell them the next time and they have always believed us and made things right, usually by giving us the item free the next time we order it.  They also often have coupons they give out, and these get you a free item (which varies depending upon how much you spend),.  All in all, we like this place. We patronize it often.  As I said, there are better places in town, but this place always serves tasty food, is clean, and the staff friendly.  Three stars for the fairly standard menu and because, if you are willing to drive out of your way you can find more authentic food. But this is American Chinese and it is worthy of your business,"}
{"text":"Tasty food, quick and friendly. The thing I like the most is it almost tastes like it needs salt. Which is great because most Chinese food makes my heart start racing from all the salt.   Recently branched out and got chicken and broccoli - I thought it was delicious. My girlfriend got the orange chicken - also tasty. Their vegetable fried rice has mushrooms in it which was disappointing for me as I don't like them. I tried to order pints of the chicken dishes but they said they only do quarts. But pints are listed on their paper menu and their 'online' menu.   We also got the crab Rangoon - plenty of filling - not overly crabby but tasty nonetheless. I agree with some of the other reviews - it's tasty, quick and friendly.  It's worth a stop but nothing I write home about."}
{"text":"I have had a few good-for-takeout meals from here. So far, I haven't had food poisoning, so that's a plus. And some of the meals have good flavor. However; their \"Four Season\" meal is mostly pork and only three pieces of shrimp. The orange chicken is mostly sauce and broccoli. Today I wanted to try something different, so I ordered \"Kung Pao Chicken\" ... Just so you know, peanuts are not included in the name of the meal and when you look at their website; it's apparently Kung Pao Chicken \"with peanuts.\" Well... It's not. It's mostly peanuts and an extremely small amount of diced chicken. When I first called and was passed onto one \"manager\" and then a further/higher \"manager\" they all simply apologized and asked to remake it. As if I was the first one to get a meal of mostly peanuts when I ordered \"Kung Pao CHICKEN.\" One guy actually thought I was mistaking peanuts for bits of chicken!!!! Hahaha!!! Chicken and peanuts totally have the same texture and flavor. Thanks for the offer of a re-do meal or a discount next time, but I have kids to put to bed and you've disappointed us enough."}
{"text":"This is our favorite Chinese restaurant in town. Run by a wonderful family. Always great service, fantastic food, nice and clean. Love the General Tso's chicken and crab Rangoon. My husband always orders the egg drop soup and I love the moo shu pork. The Lo mein and sweet & sour chicken are also delicious. Fast and friendly!"}
{"text":"Such a friendly family ran restaurant.  The food is great!  I love the vegetable fried rice and my boyfriend always gets the house fried rice which is a mix of maybe pork, chicken, & shrimp.  We always get crab Rangoon and sweet and sour chicken as well.  The vegetable egg rolls are the best I've ever had!"}
