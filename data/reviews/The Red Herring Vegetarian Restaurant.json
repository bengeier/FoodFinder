{"text":"Requires a bit of an open mind, but I love what this place stands for and that I can get a full plate of food for less than $8 and it's nothing I'll have ever tried before. I've gotten their nachos with vegan cheese, tried their deep dish pizza made with chickpea flour, as well as a Indian dish. It's always a really nice, cozy experience venturing to this side of the quad."}
{"text":"Had the weekly stew. Foods are okay. The corn bread was hard. I don't like it. But seemed the corn bread is the only dessert they have. Furniture is classic and mixed. Thought they collected the furniture from various places. A nice place to have a rest."}
{"text":"My friends have been telling me to check this place out since I got back to the midwest. One day I am feeling really bummed, and they drag me out to dinner. It's a bit of a drive so I really wasn't having it. We show up the place they have been raving about is in a basement. I'm like ehhhhhhh, but I can't just walk back. 

Walking in, it felt like a big warm hug, they got cool stuff everywhere, the people are happy, it smells great, good vibes. 

We showed up for a special dinner thing, so there was only one option, which made ordering pretty simple. 

Literalls seconds after we order our food is being brought out to us, and everyone at our table paused.... smoking hot waiter, with a newscasters voice. Bonus points. 

The food is almost perfect. There is a soup that was just the right amount of hot, some cooked greens that were packed with flavor, and I don't even know what the last thing was, a beany dish that was succulent. They also had some amazballs cupcakes!  It was only almost perfect, we didn't know what to do with our dishes. I guess we were supposed to put them up ourselves, but we didn't mind hanging out and waiting for homeboy to come and grab them.

I wish this place was closer to B-ton, I can't wait to go back, cuz if it's this good when I'm feeling moody.....

Peace."}
{"text":"I was at ISU for a while and ate lunch daily at the vegetarian restaurant on campus, The Coffee Shop.  Now that I am at the U of I and The Red Herring has become my go-to place for vegetarian food, I can say that The Red Herring is a hundred times better than The Coffee Shop!  Not only is the food completely vegan (so that both vegans and vegetarians can walk away having found something to their liking), but the food is really good!  I have been getting the weekly stew, and I have liked every single one that I have ever ordered - additionally, the rice that the stew is served with is a brown rice with some sort of grain cooked with it, and it's really tasty!  I think that there have only been two times that I have not been 100% satisfied with my food (one time was because I just was not a big fan of the dish and the other had to do with the fact that the cook put cilantro into the rice before cooking it so that it became all wilted and gross).  Still, I would recommend this place above pretty much any other restaurant I've been to in the Champaign/Urbana area (with the exception of Radio Maria..).  Not only do I feel good that I am eating a vegetarian place, but the food truly is unbeatable as well.

The only negative about this restaurant is that the portions are not very big (if you order a sandwich, you maybe only get 7 chips with it, which I feel is not only not enough for the money, but also will leave you a bit hungry).  The prices here are pretty low, though, so even if you are not getting that much food, you aren't paying sky-high prices for it either."}
{"text":"This is easy to miss in the Unitarian corner building near the foreign language and across from the science building.  It's a place you have to come to, though, if you like vegetarian fare and really one of your only legit options if you want vegan and don't want to just have a celery stick or raw veggies at some other restaurant.  All food is freshly prepared, their main menu item changes every day.  On top of this all it's fairly cheap as well.  Definitely a place you have to go and try out.

That said, I have talked to a connected friend who told me horror stories about the management changes as well.  I guess it passes between different people since it's run by the Unitarians and there is some sort of committee for it.  Apparently sometimes the place was not run in a, shall we say, cleanly and efficient manner.  That said, I hear the current manager, just like nifty c. says, is very good and the place is top quality."}
{"text":"I love the daily specials- I eat here every time I can (which isn't often because they are only open for weekday lunches I think). Such delicious food and definitely a worthwhile place to give my $5 for lunch too."}
{"text":"This place can be hit or miss depending on who is cooking. . , , but when it's good it's very good! Plus, what a treat to have a veggie restaurant in town! Sweet! Atmosphere is great and they have free wifi. Check them out! If you are not crazy about their specials, try their standards: BBQ seitan, tofu dill, falafel salad. I'm hungry just thinking about it!"}
{"text":"I'm a carnivore, but this place is so delicious. It might be one of the only places to get real, non-greasy food around campus. It always makes me feel satisfied for several hours, whereas other places you feel hungry about an hour later.
Om nom nom! Try a cup of chili with brown rice + veggies.

Furthermore on fridays they have a really sweet band playing, today there was a guitar, banjo, and a double-bass. Awesome."}
{"text":"After living in the area for many years, I finally got a chance to try The Red Herring. I took my wife to lunch on a Friday afternoon. Service was friendly and questions were answered politely.

I had the Dragon Bowl special, which was very good. I only wish that I had ordered the full portion instead of the half portion. My wife ordered a tofu dish (not sure exactly which one) which was excellent. She also wished that she had ordered the full portion.

The prices were fair and we had a good first experience here. We will return."}
{"text":"Red Herring is THE place for healthy, wholesome, creative vegan home-cooking [at lunchtime, during the fall and spring UIUC semesters].  Over the past 15 years, the management has seemed to change hands every year or two, causing wide fluctuations in quality and resulting loyalty.  Thankfully it's in the midst of one of its strongest full-swings yet (Spring 2015)!  It's in the basement of a former church, and the only way down there is one of two steep stairways.

The folks working here really seem to give a hoot about running this show with unmatched heart and effort.  Now they feature a nice big menu for lunch!  Lots of choices without sacrificing consistency or quality.  The worst part about it is making the decision between the daily special and my go-to (the Asian ginger-slaw tofu sandwich).   My only complaint: I wish they would offer dessert every once in a while... even just a cookie.  

I could always settle for the ubiquitous cornbread though.  Or the unavoidable side of corn chips.  They used to serve popcorn as the side.

Prices have gone up to pushing $10/person, but I say good for them.  RH is worth it!  Hot tip: Except for the sandwiches, there is very little difference between the \"half\" and \"full\" portion sizes.  A \"half\" bowl or plate still manages to fill your belly and save you a few bucks."}
{"text":"This is probably one of the few places on campus I can depend on to get food that won't lead to a grease coma. The food tastes fresh and healthy. The downside may be that the portions are a little small compared to other restaurants for the same price. I would recommend the chili with a cornbread muffin."}
{"text":"Go to their Wednesday night dinners! It's a straight up vegan haven. Their deserts are especially tasty, and most of their vegetables and herbs are sourced from their own garden, as well as Sola Gratia! I take my parents almost every week (they're omnivores) and they love it too! Wonderful ambiance as well! Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Used to be quite good. Sadly I could not eat more than a few bites of my \"spinach pesto\" which was made of mashed up spinach rather than basil and had no flavor. Even the cornbread was bad. on the upside when I returned it uneaten they insisted on giving me some chili for free. Unfortunately that wasn't good either but I ate it because I was starving."}
{"text":"NEW MANAGEMENT ALERT!  

The Red Herring is a local institution but the quality changes dramatically as the place has passed through many hands.  I recall with some fear the staff of years past: one cashier enjoyed candidly sharing with me stories of their disagreements with the health department.  (This was as I ordered food.)  

But that has changed.  The new manager is reportedly the same person who originally opened the place in the 1970s (says the cashier).  As a regular visitor for seven years, I found the effect striking.

The food was good!  Not just a passable alternative option as Mimi N. wrote, or something that vegetarians must eat out of desperation after they tire of green salad and fruit plate from the local chains.  The red herring is not the only option for those with a lentil craving anymore.  It is a place that you might actually go to for the food -- food that is actually good.  It didn't taste like the Red Herring I know at all; it tasted a lot better.

I had the corn chowder and the ingredients were obviously carefully selected and very fresh.  The kernels had a crisp, sweet bite.  The toasted mozzarella sandwich was also a treat with good quality cheese and fresh bread.

Unfortunately, while change is good in this case, I did notice the portion sizes have declined dramatically.  Maybe they are still working this out?  (I hope.)

I spent $7 for a half sandwich and cup of soup, and almost immediately I found that I had to go out to a second lunch.  It was the smallest half sandwich I have ever been seriously offered and charged for.  At first I mistook it for a sample or a scrap trimmed from someone else's sandwich.  I would have preferred a bowl of soup but this tiny cup size was the only choice.  $7 for a sandwich trimming and a tiny cup of soup is a little steep around here.

So enjoy the food but don't order half of anything -- the result will be too small.  

Rest assured that the crunchy atmosphere you love is still there... but cleaner.  The staff still seems to be the kind of staff that will say \"Peace out!\" after you complete your order and will lend you money if you are short.

Peace out!"}
{"text":"All I want is for this place to do well.  It deserves it.

Basically, if you survive the terrifyingly steep steps downstairs, you'll enter what appears to be a speakeasy beneath the Unitarian Center.  And by speakeasy, I don't mean Prohibition Chicago era hideouts for liquor runners, I mean a Vegetarian Speakeasy for hippies--the best kind of speakeasy. :)

The decor is eclectic and homemmade.  It basically looks like a co-op and is inhabited by the usual college town cast of characters: hipsters, professors, crunchy folk, punkers, and any person who likes great food.

I enjoyed my butternut squash bisque soup and was disappointed that they were out of cornbread today--Keep that in mind and come relatively early to avoid having them run out of foodage.  Otherwise, you should enjoy.

Go and at least check out this awesome local community spot that really seems to care about the area around it.  Good call. :)

One note, they only take cash, much like the Y-Thai.  But really, if you're eating on campus, you should spend your money on places like Y-Thai or Red Herring rather than the soulless, corporate eateries lining Green Street in CampusTown.

And there's free wifi.  Hot damn."}
{"text":"With a new and seemingly permanent chef --no more revolving door of student cooks, it seems-- the quality of the food at the Red Herring has improved drastically. Consistently flavorful and fresh, eating at the Red Herring no longer reminds me of my wayward youth eating the bland, overcooked lentil leftovers from my friends' shifts cooking for Food Not Bombs. 

The menu is streamlined with a few regular offerings --half and whole falafel or PB&J sandwiches-- and rotating soups, salads, and entrees. I've had several of the soups and salads now (black bean chili, curry butternut squash, potato and cheddar, to name a few) and each has been delicious thus far. The bowl of chili is even filling! However, I would warn against taking your meal to go because of the aforementioned portion problem -- for soups, I've been given a medium paper coffee cup only a third full when I've ordered a bowl's worth. The staff was happy to give me more once I noticed, but since then I've tried to just eat my food there.

While I like the bartering premise of the shared labor --sign up for an hour's worth of work and get a free meal-- this does provide for some inadvertent hi-jinks at the cash register and in the kitchen. I came one day when there were clearly too many volunteers on the shift who hadn't yet been trained, and I found myself unable to look away from the comedic fumblings (tickets being moved around the counter with orders being filled twice as a result, and a hilarious attempt to bag my soup in several plastic bags, each abandoned once the realization hit again and again that a cup of soup is NOT going to stay upright in a plastic bag). It was like watching a sit-com kitchen, but live! I enjoyed it immensely.

That said, the service is usually quick and friendly, with plenty of smiles!"}
{"text":"I really wanted to like this place, being both vegetarian and right next to my building.  After several visits though, I had to concede that it just isn't that good.  Tables are constantly dirty.  Food is inconsistent, too expensive for the quality and portion size, and generally not very tasty.

The employees are in a constant state of confusion, seemingly overwhelmed by the trickle of customers during the lunchtime \"rush\".  The ordering process is inefficient, with very little thought put into organization of the process.

Basically, this place has all of the drawbacks of a small, quirky cafe, with virtually none of the payoff.  

I am currently at the restaurant again, having given in to proximity over quality, and I am regretting it."}
{"text":"In 2011, for the very first time, I sat down at a paint chipped table in the middle of what could only be described as a \"Church basement\" -- slightly damp, definitely dark -- and looked around at what art and food, and culture had brought together.  I was with a friend, at the time.  An extremely good friend.  Neither one of us knew what to expect, or how to really proceed, but two mushroom risotto later, and.. I mean.. LIFE. CHANGED. right there.

This place is a cash and carry.  You pay for the plate, and if you're part of the collective, you sweep your own dishes.  No one pampers you, here, but that's not really the point of what they're doing.  They're just doing warm, sincere, totally honest food (on par with any haute cuisine), keeping it free from anything that isn't vegetable or mineral (and plenty of carbs ;D).  Truly, spectacular, filling food for a great price.  Just don't come in expecting a waitress or to pay with your plastic.  That's a no go.

TRH is still one of Urbana's best kept secrets.  Sometimes things are better that way.  Stay shiny, Red Herring.  Shine on!

--

After years, it appears things have changed.  Apologies!  

THEY ACCEPT YOUR PLASTIC, NOW.  YAY!"}
{"text":"Oh, Red Herring!  Be still my heart.  I loved this place before I ever considered eating vegan, and it's been a haven for me since then.  The specials never fail to delight, so much so that I went six months never trying a regular menu item because I was so entranced by the daily specials.  The BBQ seitan is outta control good--so fantastic that I find myself picking up the escaping pieces of seitan with my fingers and then licking the sauce off.  The falafel is phenomenal as well.  

Meat-eaters, have no fear.  I've brought many a devout omnivore to Red Herring, and they've raved about their eats as well.  The chef does a fantastic job of dreaming up dishes that are flavorful and filling (and still pretty damn cheap).  I find the whole sandwich fills me up nicely for $5, and the specials are always a meal-and-a-half for a bit more.

I'm sad they weren't able to keep dinner service going, but I've got my fingers crossed they'll revisit that another time.  

Red Herring, thank you for satisfying my stomach, making sure this mostly vegan gal never feels frustrated grabbing a lunch out, and helping me feel completely guiltless about eating out."}
{"text":"Awesome staff
Amazing Vegetarian lunches
Lots of seating
Socially Conscious business

Love this place!"}
{"text":"I loved this place. The atmosphere is lovely and relaxed and so is the food. I've been meaning to come here for quite some time, but the hours that they are open never match up with when I have wanted to go. The hours are pretty random and short but it is worth planning a trip. The food is very good and very fresh, it is a little pricey for the portion size, which is pretty small, but it was worth it. I would recommend for any vegans, vegetarians, ethnic cuisine lovers, or just healthy eaters!"}
{"text":"I am not vegan or vegetarian but my friend is so I went with him and thought I would try it. I had the BBQ seitan and for someone who doesn't eat that type of thing normally it was actually pretty good. It had the look, feel, and taste of bbq pork. I also had a side salad that had a yummy herb vingearatte. I don't think I would go back again because I like my meat but it was definitely tasty and if you are looking for a vegetarian type of place definitely go check it out!!"}
{"text":"I had lunch here for the first time yesterday. I had the falafel salad and the soup of the day, I think it was called Samosa. Both things were excellent, Im probably going back today for their fusion meal.
SO GLAD I FOUND THIS PLACE! No better way to spend $10 for lunch!"}
{"text":"OK, I'll admit it- I generally detest vegetables, so the idea of a vegan restaurant did not initially appeal to me. However, thanks to the Red Herring, I have been converted to the veggie cause. 

The Red Herring is staffed by dedicated volunteers and generally these are people quite knowledgeable in the ways to making vegetables delectable. It's a small place, nothing fancy, but it's quite nice for a non-for-profit establishment. On a cold day there I always like to get their $3.00 bowl of vegetable soup with corn bread. The soups, like the entrees and desserts, vary each day. Some days might be better or worse than others, but I can usually find something I like. The corn bread is the wonderful constant in this equation. It's soft and melts in your mouth. 

Besides the cornbread, the next best thing is the ingredients. They use lots of local and organic products.

Even if you are not exactly crunchy and you like your red meat, I suggest trying The Red Herring. Hopefully you'll be pleasantly surprised.

P.S. They are now serving dinner."}
{"text":"It is so nice to have a vegan restaurant in CU. I see another is opening and claiming to be the first. Well The Red Herring was first a long time ago and it is great. The variety of flavors offered makes it a place you can return to often. The atmosphere is, well, laid back and comfy. Nice in the middle of a frenetic day. The staff is always friendly and welcoming and they know their dishes enough to make great recommendations. 

In short, whether you are vegan or not you should visit The Red Herring and enjoy a great lunch served with a smile in a place that begs for a good book or a good friend to join you. Try it. You'll like it."}
{"text":"WHY CAN'T I GIVE THIS PLACE 10 STARS?!?!
Seriously, this place is beyond awesome.

My hubby and I ordered all three of the dinner menu items available during our visit. Then we ordered two desserts, ooh la la! All menu items were gluten-free and vegan.

#1. Peach & Pepper Fajitas: baked local peaches, local zucchini, local rainbow bell peppers, onions, lettuce, local tomatoes. Guac, rice, and black beans. Served with classic salsa and watermelon slice. ($9)
#2. Mexican Street Corn: Cheezy spice blend, and cilantro slathered onto half and ear of corn. ($2)
#3. Salsa Sampler: tomatillo, peach-habanero, and roasted corn + black bean. Served with chips. ($3.50)
#4. (Dessert) Coconut Milk Horchata Cake ($4.25)
#5. Avocado Lime Mini Pie: date-nut crust. ($3.25)

Every dish was perfectly prepared and the flavors were some of the best I have ever experienced in vegan dishes or otherwise. This is a place to take your skeptical family member who thinks vegan cuisine is weird and gross, cuz it will BLOW THEIR MIND.

Staff is very friendly - it's like being in your best friend's kitchen.
Visit this place immediately and often!"}
{"text":"As soon as I walked in I felt like I was transported to Ithaca, NY.  The ambiance is cozy with a funky, nature-loving theme.

The food was incredibly delicious and satisfying, even for a non-vegan.  I had a cornbread muffin which surprised me by being not very sweet.  Instead it was a bit crumbly and grainy in a really savory way.

I also had the green goodness soup which is easily some of the best green soup I've ever had!  When I first saw it, I was a little worried it would taste like chopped veggies with a weird after-taste. That was totally wrong.  I could taste the chopped up vegetables alongside smooth spices and a hint of lemon.  I enjoyed every bite!

I completely recommend this place if you're in the mood for well-made food or if you miss Ithaca ;D"}
{"text":"hippies are weird. but one thing they do well is make vegetables taste good. i've enjoyed everything i've had here and it's a great atmosphere to relax during a busy day."}
{"text":"On an icy winter's day, Red Herring soup melts my insides. I'll reject red meat any day for it. Their soup menu changes daily... and everyday it's made fresh by volunteers. So - if you're low on cash, you can work here in exchange for food. Not too shabby!

I have heard rave reviews about the Krishna dinner... and damn! I forget almost every Monday. But how could the reviews be wrong? Five bucks for an all you can eat, organic, home cooked meal? Damn straight!"}
{"text":"This is my favorite space on campus for lunch. It is such a sanctuary from the stress of the day. I have everything on the menu so many times that I usually always get the special now to keep things interesting. The specials are always unique and usually can come in a few different forms: wrap, sandwich, salad, (sometimes soup)"}
{"text":"Ate here about ten times over two years before writing this review.

It sometimes takes 40 minutes to get a salad, which is weird, because they are only open for lunch. So, it's a great place to take vegan friends when you're in no rush and just socializing. It's a terrible place to go when you only have an hour for lunch.

Also, I seriously love vegan food, which is often complex, flavorful, and well-spiced. This.... isn't. Not even a little. For these prices, I'd rather hit up Lai Lai Wok, or another traditional Chinese place on campus, and get a much bigger portion of stir-fried veggies and rice. 

I appreciate their cruelty-free food message, and I'm probably their target audience, since I love vegan food... but I wish the taste justified the price tag."}
{"text":"If there is one thing I mass about ol' Chambana - it's Red Herring. This place is just so wonderful. Where do I start?

My typical memory of it would be walking in on a blisteringly cold day. I'd be greeted by steamy warm, earthy air. My glasses would fog up and I'd go blind for a moment. Once the fog disappeared I'd be greeted with a wide variety of the community - from the still thinks-it's-the-70s hippie to the like-oh-my-god-check-out-my-North-Face-fleece! sorority girl - everybody is represented. Definitely more hippies than greeks - but yeah. I suppose I fall in the middle there and never felt out of place.

The place is staffed mostly by volunteers who as I recall get paid with a meal for a certain amount of work. Go there for a little while and you'll quickly get to know the staff - they're all great.

So next it's time to order. They have their daily menu listed and it's always different. Prices are not bad - $5-8 will get you a full meal as I recall.

So the food - I have yet to buy something here that wasn't fantastic. Maybe I'm easy to please (as some of the other reviewers would make one think) - but geeze - it's all so great! There is a clear stand out though - the BBQ tempeh sandwich. I've tried to recreate this item at home (since I now live halfway across the country!) but I just can't get it as good as Red Herring did.

I've taken many people here - from red blooded meat lovers to normal folk and everybody else - and I have yet to hear a complaint. Fantastic place - highly recommended!"}
{"text":"I admit, this place can be hit-or-miss when it comes to dining, but I love it and so will you.  Open for lunch, grab a sandwich and soup, a choice of vegetarian entrees and coffee.  The Krishnas put on a Monday night meal, all you can eat for $5.  Very peaceful and cooperative, and spiritually and gastronomically healthy."}
{"text":"The atmosphere is extremely relaxing, the food is amazing, and the folk music is divine! What a great place!"}
{"text":"The food is bland and the portions meager, but as the only dedicated vegetarian restaurant on campus, Red Herring gets stars for being cool. Surface over substance."}
{"text":"So I'm not really a vegetarian, but I like to be a poser, I ate at Field of Greens while in the dorms and I eat here when I actually have my lunch hour free on campus.  Sure a lot of people have said this can be hit or miss, but I find the hummus sandwiches to be excellent every time.  They always have fresh veggies on them and have a lot of flavor, plus the homemade wheat bread is awesome.  The sweet potato and corn chowder is quite good as well.  Alas I still haven't been able to try the cornbread, it seems they always run out within the two people ordering in front of me, so get there early if you can.  The coffee isn't outstanding, for that  I would walk down the street to Espresso. Great place to support and cheap eats, I usually spend no more than $6.  Basically you should go if you are on campus for lunch and want a healthy alternative to chains on green st."}

{"text":"Amazing vegetarian restaurant right on campus. Staff is more than accommodating and overall vibe of the whole place is enjoyable. Live music is fun and entertaining. Food is delicious and menu is full of variety while all being vegetarian and/or vegan friendly. Highly recommend the Black Bean Burger, so good!"}
{"text":"5 buck karma-free Monday night dinner?  Gotta give that a shout out.  Anyplace that satisfies my evening grubbin' needs that cheaply can make the whole day seem even better.

Down the steep stairs and into the warm scent of good hippie eats.  You get in line, toss your fiver in a basket, and are given large portions of whatever they cooked up.

Tonight was rice, veggies with Indian flavors, kick-ass lentil soup, and a brownie.  Drinks cost extra, water is free with dinner.  You can eat as much food as can be shoveled down.

The atmosphere is like a laid-back commune, with a smattering of all campus types.  Punk, hippie, geek, frat/soror, etc.  It's a really friendly place with a community-building-is-awesome vibe.

My friends who've been in town awhile say it can be a tad hit or miss.  Tonight was for the win, fo' sho'.  

Another tip I was given is to bring a Tupperware.  If you accidentally get more seconds than you can eat, you'll be able to have some noms for lunch the next day.  Or, ya know, snacking on the way home.  It might be a little less karma free that way, though..."}
{"text":"I used to go to Red Herring at least once/twice a week during my undergrad years.

In my opinion, the best lunch option near campus, and never as packed as some of the shittier places nearby.  Soup and sandwiches were always great, and the entrees were good too.  I could never convince my friends to come with me, because they were idiots.

The food definitely fluctuated in terms of taste/quality depending on who was working that day. I still remember a specific dish I had back in '05 that still ranks among the top 10 things I have ever eaten. Unfortunately, by comparison, nothing else from there ever lived up to that one dish, even though it was always excellent."}
{"text":"The Red Herring is, without a doubt, the best restaurant in this world, or any other."}
{"text":"In the basement of an old church, not ADA compliant , other wise manager Holly works magic with the vegan menu."}
{"text":"Very hit or miss at this place. I've never had anything that is *bad* but I've also never eaten anything here that really blew me away. I did enjoy the vegan/vegetarian chili that I had there a couple of times. Definitely not a must eat though."}
{"text":"Let me start by saying that I really like this place. Until just recently, I've only been here for lunch (which never disappoints). Having just gone to my first Monday night krishna buffet, I am in total awe. The food was unbelievably tasty, cheap, and there was an overall jolly atmosphere going around.

If I could take off a half-point, I'd only do so for the times that I'm not carrying any cash on me. Besides that, I love this place."}
{"text":"We were actually brought here by Annie W. during our visit to UIUC. (Not sure if you can tell, she's a big fan!)

I ordered half a hummus pita with a garden salad on the side. I actually liked the hummus, although I don't eat hummus as much as I'd like to. There were lots of fresh veggies in there, although the distribution through my little pita pocket was a bit awkward. (Chock full o' hummus on one side, lots of veggies on the other.) I ordered the salad with the sesame tahini, but I wasn't a huge fan of the tahini. I don't eat tahini often, though, so maybe I'm just not a tahini person? (The vinaigrette would've complemented the meal better.) The meal was served with some plain popcorn.

I found my meal okay, but I would definitely be cautious to omnivores (and especially carnivores xD). Many of the people I was eating with were pretty dissatisfied with the flavors in their food? Even the little bottle of hot sauce (I think it was a kind of salsa?) wasn't really doing much to quench their hunger. I'm a bit more used to vegetarian food, but if your friends aren't used to vegetarian food, this is probably not the place to try to introduce them to it.

I liked the atmosphere of the restaurant, but again, it can come off as \"weird\" and \"hippie-ish\" for people who aren't used to it. We had a guy playing BOTH the guitar and the xylophone up front and, not going to lie, he was reinforcing the stereotype of \"hippie-ish\" in this restaurant with his look a wee bit, according to some of my lunchmates.

But I liked it. There was a little station for you to fill up on water, iced tea, or hot tea, cane sugar, organic teas... considering that you're not paying a whole lot, I thought that you got a pretty great deal, ESPECIALLY if you are a vegetarian or a vegan, you know? 

However, if you're bringing a friend who has never heard of seitan and doesn't really like that organic feel, then this is the wrong place to bring him/her. If you're into that, though, this is an AWESOME place. Even the back of the bathroom door contributed to the overall feel of this restaurant that I had to descend into. It is very much like a co-op (if you've been to one before), but I'll admit, not everyone is going to love it. I personally liked it, though."}
{"text":"This place is the best at what it sets out to do. I love everything from the eclectic decor of the restaurant to the displays for social activism and environmental responsibility everywhere you turn. The Red Herring is truly a wonderful addition to the Champaign-Urbana community. 

The entrance is a little bit hard to find. Just look for the vertical sign that says \"OPEN\" (it would be covered with a tarp if they're closed) and go down the stairs. Once you walk in, you can order first at the counter and then pick a seat. When your order is ready, the waiter will come out and call your name, and when they see you, they'll bring it right over.  All the staff are incredibly passionate about what they do and it really shows when they interact with you!

The food, especially on cultural nights, is delicious! Cultural nights feature \"Platters\" which are generally between $9-11 with all the appetizers and entrees. There is a separate dessert menu. I am always excited to eat here (pretty much every Wednesday night) because I know I'll most likely be trying something new, but I'm still confident it'll taste great. Are there some misses? Sure.  But the overall creativity and cohesion of each meal is a party for my tastebuds. I would caution that this is a place for adventurous eaters or those who are enthusiastic about vegetarian/vegan food! If you need your meat fix, look elsewhere!

PROTIP: Always get dessert! Even if it's to go, because there is so much effort that goes into putting together gluten free or dairy free recipes that you can taste the difference. Their cake is always spot on!

I have yet to stop by for lunch, but their breakfast is just meh. The only savory options they had were toast, and while it tasted very good, I feel like I could have made it at home. 

Conclusion: Come here for dinner! This is a great place to try vegan if you've never eaten it before."}
{"text":"This is one of those places that I go back to in my memory and is, honestly, one of the things I miss about the Midwest. My Champaign trips were always enjoyable, but I think this place is really indicative of the true vibe and attitude in that town.
On my first visit, it was a rainy day. I had a late lunch and was just sitting afterward, working on the laptop, when they started cleaning up and most people started leaving. I asked one of the staff what time they closed, and he responded \"We're a church, so we don't close.\"
And that's the thing: they are a church, but they don't push Jesus in your face in their basement restaurant. They're just serving the local community. Providing a warm and welcoming space, with warm and hearty meals, free of pretenses. I mean, this is not the best food you'll ever eat and this is not the best restaurant in the city. But they do well with what they have, I think, and I really appreciate what they're doing. I hope that this place sticks around for a while."}
{"text":"I am a former vegetarian working nearby, but was scared to come here.  On a previous visit, a friend and I left because of the crowd, which I know now was probably a buffet night.

I'm glad I finally got over it and gave it a try, because that was some of the best falafel I've ever had.  I also had the curry soup, which was very flavorful and seasoned just right.  A half falafel \"sandwich\" (which includes popcorn and a dill spear), cup of soup du jour, and a cookie cost me roughly $7.  They also have a water cooler with a stack of non-disposable cups."}
{"text":"I'm not a vegetarian but I love this place. One of the few, possibly only places on campus to get a real-food meal made with fresh, unprocessed ingredients. Alot of their ingredients are sourced locally. I started out going here for lunch on occasion but lately I have been going to their vegan fusion dinners."}
{"text":"OK, I have to say that I am very spoiled when it comes to vegetarian or vegan food; I prefer the \"gourmet\" vegetarian and vegan food that takes a lot of preparation and hours in the kitchen for someone to crank out. This place is not that and I didn't know this going in. The hippies and the sloppy \"chill, man\" attitude around the joint quickly made me realize what I was in for and I was right. The food was OK, as in I can, and do, make it at home so it's not very interesting. The portions were HUGE and the price a bit steep; I'd rather pay less for a smaller portion. 
The place is definitely unique but not as great as I though it should be; I kept hearing such great things that I expected more. But, I'll give them another try sometime to see if it gets better."}
{"text":"The ambience here is somewhat lacking, but the menu features eclectic options and eco-conscious choices. The food was tasty, but sat a bit heavy for me. Large portions and decent prices make this a worthwhile place, but with room for improvement."}
{"text":"This is the kind of place you want to support, you want to see survive.

While I was living in CU, it closed down a few times, but always came back to life.

It has been said the food is hit or miss - I agree. But I think more times than not - it is delicious and filling.

I always did my best to try something new and was usually left feeling warm and satisfied."}
{"text":"I had a phenomenal meal at this place! The service was also very friendly and welcoming. I would recommend everyone go at least once!"}
{"text":"Decent vegetarian. I wish they wouldn't use stale, frozen pita, though."}
{"text":"I love this place.  The food is vegan but you would probably not even realize it if you weren't paying close attention because it is delicious, flavorful, and makes a lasting impression.  The staff is super friendly, the ambiance is friendly, welcoming, and open.  The concept is wonderful.  The prices might be a little steep for the amount of food you get sometimes but it all balances out in the end.  Totally my favorite place to go for lunches during the day because of its proximity to the quad."}
{"text":"I love the weekly international dinners! I especially miss Ethiopian and am excited that they have a dinner night serving that cuisine. Coming here is one of my favorite things!"}
{"text":"This is one of the coolest places in Urbana. The Red Herring has been around for many years - my mom used to hang out here in the late 60s and early 70s when she was in high school. I may be biased about the food as one of my best friends used to be the head chef, but I love it!

I have never had a bad experience here. The most recent time I went, I had the chili and the vegan nachos. Let me start out by saying that I'm not vegetarian OR vegan but I am always down to try new things! Both had great flavor, and the cashew nacho cheese actually tastes just like cheese!

It is also a great place to come just to grab coffee. It is usually quiet inside, with a mix of casual lunchers and people studying with soft music playing. It is a great atmosphere to catch up with a friend.

I love the Red Herring and you should too!"}
{"text":"I REALLY want to like this place.  On paper it sounds amazing, super healthy vegan/vegetarian food.  Lots of organic, free trade type stuff.

Unfortunately it usually fails to impress.  

The dishes usually bland and uninteresting (mostly stews and vegan imitations of american and western european meat dishes that most meat eaters don't even like that much, like beef stroganoff for example).  
 
On top of that I made the trip out there on four separate occasions only to find the place was closed with a note on the door saying \"Sorry we are too tired to cook today.  Here's a recipe if you want to make your own dinner.\"  WTF.  I know this place is a non-profit but they seem to reject the notion that a business should strive to please their customers if they expect to survive.  Of course only greedy capitalists care about such things.."}
{"text":"This place was off to a bad start when they told us over the phone we could place a carry out order. They asked when they could expect us, we said 30 mins. When we got there they hadn't even put the order in yet. If they would have told us over the phone they would wait until we were there to even put it in, we wouldn't have gone there. Most people who place orders over the phone have places to be. The hummus was super thick and chunky and lacking flavor. It came with 4 tiny pita piece and some cucumber and carrots. I won't lie though, my seitan sandwich was the bomb. so flavorful and delicious. But it wasn't a BLT like yelp suggests that they offered, it was BBQ. They also aren't currently offering a black bean burger. My husband got a wrap instead. It was not good. super bland. I'm also not a fan of serving things with a side of plain tortilla chips. I also had a muffin, which was pretty good."}
{"text":"I've been here a couple of times. I also attended one of their vegan baking classes which was amazing. The staff are amazing and the restaurant itself is very very welcoming. I came to one of their cultural nights for Nicaraguan food and was pleasantly surprised. Having grown up with it, it was nice to see that they really put the effort to seek what is a typical dish from the region!

The food was delicious and it was SO filling. We had a lentil/mushroom stew with rice and beans and a yummy enchilada. I loved the black bean brownie at the end (I want to make this!). Overall, our eating experience was great and the staff were so friendly. :) I really enjoyed it and I would love to come back to check out their other cultural dinners!"}
{"text":"Fantastic bbq seitan sandwich. Even better than the one offered @ clover in cambridge, ma!"}
