{"text":"The food here is excellent and healthy. Some dishes don't have oil &  they don't use MSG. The Mongolian chicken is one of the tastier dishes as some can be a little bland probably due to the health conscience nature of the food. They recently updated the interior so it's a lot more inviting and they now have Pho soup! Great prices on lunch too!"}
{"text":"Love this place! My favorite dish is their chicken fried rice! The owner here is super nice and the food here is delish!"}
{"text":"We love this place. Every time my work family and I go to China Lite the people are great and the food is delish. I have had their orange chicken, garlic chicken, Kung Pow chicken, and broccoli and beef . All awesome....also love the spring rolls and the partan cream cheese. Today we had it delivered to our office. The driver was very friendly, and the food was to us while it was still hot, and in the time promised. Great job every time China Lite we will be back.:)"}
{"text":"I love China Lite, we get take out about 1 per month, sometimes eat in. The food is good and healthy! You can't beat the price!! Our faves are the Mongolian beef and orange chicken are our favorite. We also like the crab ragoons!"}
{"text":"First the good: The staff is very nice, the food is prepared fast, and even though it's small, it's a nice atmosphere. I've had a few meals here and unfortunately, the food tastes very bland to me, like there are no seasonings at all (except for the Tom soup, which was spicy). The chicken pad thai was just covered in peanuts and the chicken smelled and tasted bad. The chicken and shrimp in the soup were dense, like overdone, and didn't seem fresh either. If the food were fresh and they used lots of spices, then I'd be a regular takeout customer."}
{"text":"Not a big fan... They nickel and dime you. I ordered the lettuce wraps and they do not serve enough lettuce with the order.  I asked for one additional piece of iceberg lettuce and they charged me $1.00!!!! I could have walked to Albertson's next door and bought an entire head of lettuce for 59 cents!!!"}
{"text":"Great place for takeout!  I eat here for lunch several times each week.  The food is consistently good, the owner is very nice, and the prices are low.  I especially like that most of the dishes are very healthy."}
{"text":"Great service and prices. This is the epitome of Mom & Pop as it is run by a husband and wife. It's always prepared fresh and quickly. The spicy chicken dishes have more flavor than the healthy meals, remember it's called China LITE for a reason because the dishes are prepared with healthy oils and sauces. I always feel good and healthy when I leave there. The portions sizes are great too as it's hard to finish, you seem to always get some chinese to take home with you & that's never a bad thing. The lunch combos are a terrific deal, you can't beat the prices and how you feel when you leave. For those wanting to eat healthy and for those looking to lose weight I would add this to your list of places. They just recently remodeled and it now has a more modern vibe and a new TV."}
{"text":"Came here as a suggestion from my girlfriend. Very friendly, quick, priced reasonably and GOOD! It's a quick eat in or take out type place."}
{"text":"Awesome, cheap, healthy, and fast Chinese food! Some of the most friendly staff and Best service of any restaurants around Scottsdale period!"}
{"text":"Searching for for Chinese take-out, I decided to try China Lite.  We enjoyed the food.  It's set up like a sandwich shop (vs. a typical Chinese restaurant), so dining in is possible, but it will not be elegant in any way.  The food tasted fresh, was not greasy and the several dishes we sampled had different tastes and sauces.  That's a terrific starting point for Chinese restaurant goodness, and China Lite passed our test.  We're going to try some of the other places in the vicinity, but will likely return to China Lite."}
{"text":"Chinese food is generally speaking horrible for you, but this place bucks the trend. They use healthy fresh ingredients, and don't drown the meals in sauce. I've had the whole menu and can say I've liked everything. Great prices too."}
{"text":"Tasty and freshly made food at a great price.  Being from Los Angeles we are naturally picky about food quality and China Lite does not disappoint.  Ma Po Tofu, Curry Chicken, and Beef with Snow Peas tasted great.  Definitely give this place a try."}
{"text":"Went in today, excited by the items listed on a special board outside.  And the food I saw go out looked and smelled very appealing.  Waited for a few minutes, standing there awkwardly, finally was told to grab a seat.  After a few minutes the sole harried looking waitress asked if I needed a menu.  I said yes, and asked for water in response to her question as to what I'd like to drink.  Never got that water by the way.  Several other people came in after me, until each table was full.  I kept trying to catch her eye to place my order, even waving my hand and saying excuse me at one point, but it was like I was invisible.  After watching her take orders from multiple parties who entered after me, I gave up and left.  As I said, the food looked and smelled good, hence two stars instead of one, but that didn't fill my empty stomach!  They obviously need more than one server (I witnessed three people tired of waiting get up and go to the counter for chili sauces and chopsticks), but that doesn't explain why she took orders from people who entered after me, while completely ignoring me.  It's a shame, I really did want to give it a try."}
{"text":"This is good stuff.  Tasty, healthy and very pleasant service from the woman that owns it.  Some of the best Chinese in the Valley.  It's definitely worth a try."}
{"text":"Very sad to see Chef KC and Sarah close this really wonderful spot. We are worried about them and hope and wish the best for them and their family. Raj and Haynes."}
{"text":"I ordered the crispy tofu which comes with an assortment of veggies and is drenched in a brown garlic sauce, but I also added a little spice. It was good, and I'll definitely come back for it again. The service was friendly and speedy -- a nice little lunch find."}
{"text":"Just your average Chinese restaurant nothing special nothing bad food was good nothing to write home about I went take the drive to go there again and honestly I don't even remember what I had service was slow brought mine food and then I took another 10 minutes to bring my food overall mediocre"}
{"text":"I love this place by far my favorite Chinese place in the valley! Sadly they are closed forever now. I think someone might have passed away either the cook who has been there since 1997 or the lady who works in the front. I am really going to miss this place and if anyone knows what happened please message me. I have only been going there for about a year but wow this is one of those places that you never forget."}
{"text":"I am giving this one star because the management doesn't respect its clientele.  Twice this week I drove there to have dinner and they were closed.  Firstly, last Saturday, I arrived at 5:30 PM and they were closed.  The information on Yelp states that they are open until 12 AM.  So at 5:30 PM, I expected them to be open.  Are they confusing 12AM with 12PM?    Today, Wednesday, Jan. 11,  I arrived at 6:30PM with 3 additional family members and as we got closer with the car we noted that there were no lights in the restaurant.  I thought it was just an illusion so I got out of the car and walked to the door.  I saw a note on the door that read:   Sorry, We are closed this evening.  Sarah.  The hours posted for Wednesdays read that they are open until 8PM.   So let me try to understand this.  You have a restaurant, you post your hours, and then you open the restaurant when it suits you?  This is not the actions of a respectful person.  Not respectful to her clientele.   Too shocking for words."}
{"text":"I love the spicy shrimp.  The best restaurant for lunch special.  Everything cook fresh . The place is nice and clean too."}
{"text":"So the one day i didn't bring lunch to work i decided to drive around the office to see what sounded good. I saw this place and said \"what the heck. Ill give it a try\" and let me tell you IT IS THE BEST CHINESE RESTAURANT I have EVER been too! The services was AWESOME and the food! OMG THE FOOD! was DE-LI-CIOUS! So good, i told my boyfriend that we must go there together! I had the Spicy chicken lunch special with fried rice and it came with an egg roll. I think the price was right too! I most definitely recommend!"}
{"text":"Best Chinese in town. My fianc√© and I don't go anywhere else. I have heard they are reopening and we couldn't be more excited. If you want delicious flavors, authentic food and overall wonderful service, come here because you won't regret it. Also, the wife makes the chili oil and it is literally the best!!"}
{"text":"I agree with one of the yelpers below..... unfortunately I was coming here to have lunch and their hours say that opened at 11AM. I arrived at NOON and they were not open. Disappointing."}
{"text":"It's really good if you can get served. Three visits, only got to eat twice.  Service was slow and erratic the first two times, but I've gone back because the food really is good.  Ending up walking out last visit after not-quite fifteen minutes.  Didn't know I was invisible until now. I have other choices...  Maybe if they'd spend less effort on bragging about the chef, and more on service, I'd go back."}
{"text":"This place is the bomb.  I've lived in this area for 7+ years and if there's a place where you can get quick, inexpensive and HEALTHY food that's better than this, I haven't found it.  It's sorta like Pei Wei only much better food.  If you haven't been there since October, 2013 - check it out again.  They recently remodeled and it looks much more upscale than before.  I was getting the Korean soup but the fish is really tasty so I'm starting to order that now."}
{"text":"Truly a weird place.  I don't think this place knows what type of asian restaurant it wants to be.  The menu is all over the place.  It could be chicken teriyaki place, or could be a thai place, or it could be straight on chinese.  I don't really know.  And so, it's sort of the weakness of this place.  I got the Lite chicken off their menu, which should be their specialty, but it was nothing to write home about.  It was cheap at least."}
{"text":"Every time I come home to Scottsdale, I make sure at some point during my stay to stop in at China Lite and get a Sergeant Chang's Chicken to go. I have a deep love for this dish, it is reminiscent of General Tso's style chicken, but without the fatty, greasiness! There used to be a China Lite up on FLW right by my house, but it closed, so I drive down just to get this dish! I rarely eat in here, the decor is nothing exciting, rather bland in fact, but the food is always ready to take home within 10 minutes, and is super affordable. I also enjoy the Crab Puff appetizer here (Partan Cream Chease), and its been awhile but the Honey Crisp Chicken is also very good. If you come for lunch you can get these for even cheaper! All of the other entrees are made according to China Lite's \"healthy chinese\" practices, without sacrificing flavor. I am friends with the family that owns the chain of these restaurants and am happy to give them my business! Gotta have my Sergeant Chang's! Yum!!"}
{"text":"Placed a to go order and was told 15-20 mins. Sounded good for a pickup time. Arrived at the restaurant and 8 people were seated for dinner. They need more help, only 2 people working. Still waiting nearly 40 mins after ordering and food is not ready. Not rating the food but the service is abominable."}
{"text":"Love the food and the bubba drinks!! A friend  told me about the restaurant and also have delivery so I will keep on main when I don't want to make dinner."}
{"text":"excited about reopening, but ended up disappointed,   kung pao chicken and fried rice was a bit dry, wasn't nearly as good as before  will give one more try in a couple weeks to give them a chance to iron things out"}
{"text":"Good food, tiny portions, pricey for the amount you get."}
{"text":"I was excited to try this place based on previous reviews, but it appears the new owners have taken this restaurant in a different direction. Our to-go order was incorrect and the chicken dishes tasted like they were made in a microwave."}
{"text":"I was craving for some pad thai and didn't want to drive too far. I decided to order from China Lite as a coworker had mentioned it was pretty good here. Wow, never again. It wasn't very tasty! The flavor was really off and while it looked a lot like pad thai, it certainly did not taste like any I've had before. I never had pad thai that came with brocolli and zuchini! I should've known not to order thai at a chinese place! If it were based on the pad thai alone, I would've given this place 1 star! But I've been here several times before and usually get the szechuan green beans and really enjoy it so they get some redemption points for that. I haven't tried anything else and at this point, probably wont. I will stick to the green beans when coming here!"}
{"text":"No flavor. None. I think they're trying for the no oil and very healthy thing, but it shouldn't lack so much flavor. I has to douse my Dan Dan noodles in sriracha. The whole environment of the restaurant was very old and dirty.  I don't plan on coming back to Arizona, but I def wouldn't recommend this place."}
{"text":"This place has been updated and seems a bit smaller and make sure you call in an order ahead of time because they are BUSY during lunch.  For good reason though, this place is amazing.  Affordable and consistently good quality food makes this place choice for lunch or dinner.  If you like traditional americanized chinese dishes, orange chicken or beef and mongolian beef are a wonderful choice.  The fried rice is incredible.  However, if you are looking for something more exotic I cannot recommend enough that you try the curry laksa.  It is delicious.  I am so glad this place exists."}
{"text":"Really enjoyed the food. They are located in the corner of a strip mall, this is really a hidden gem. Prices are great as well as food. Went on a week day and got my food quickly. Very fresh and tasty.  Will be a regular for me at lunch."}
{"text":"I went here in October 2014, but am finally getting around to review it, I plan to go back, mainly because it is close to my place of residence.  The Good: While not your typical hot and sour soup (more peppery than most), I still enjoyed it (I just wouldn't call it hot and sour soup anymore).  I also liked the orange chicken. Nice atmosphere and nice staff.    The Meh: I tried the eggplant since all the other reviewers were recommending it, but it was a bit too saucy and goopy for me (and I LOVE sauce, so that is a pretty impressive feat)."}
{"text":"A fast casual Chinese concept that seems a little less chain-ish than Pei Wei... My friend Allyson B introduced me to this place.  I love that it's around the corner from the dog park - it's perfect because I can take Minnie to the dog park to play and call my order in as I'm leaving and it's usually ready when i arrive.  I've been a handful of times and always done take-out.  It's really not the type of place you want to stay and hang out.  There is no atmosphere and it's located in a strip-mall.  Since the tag line is \"A Healthy Food Bistro,\" I feel like it's healthier for me than other Chinese in the valley... but I think that's just in my head!  Still, I tell them 'light oil' whenever I order.  I feel less guilty that way!  Unfortunately, I'm not a big fan of the protein options.  First time around, I ordered shrimp with veggies - the shrimp did not taste fresh so I picked around it and ate the veggies and brown rice.  I went with chicken the next few times, and when I saw that they have eggplant (my fave) on the menu, I started requesting a combo of eggplant, mixed veggies, and chicken. Still, the chicken tastes almost processed - Once again, I eat the veggies and rice.  Maybe the key is to order beef or tofu... I'll keep trying until I get it right, or maybe I'll just have to find an alternative.    Either way, China Lite gets 3 stars from me.  If you go, get the eggplant - that's the only item I can really recommend!"}
{"text":"Delicious! I went here today with my friend because we were looking for something light for lunch. We decided to try China Lite because she heard that they offer quite a few healthy choices on the menu. Not only was the service friendly and prompt, the food was yummy! I will definitely be going back, today I had the Mongolian chicken, but that is just because I didn't see the spicy eggplant dish. My friend had the Thai chicken and said she enjoyed it very much."}
{"text":"Cheerfully accommodating special requests (no oil, extra spicy) combined with the best kung pao I've had in Scottsdale has made me a regular."}
{"text":"This is one of the better Chinese-American restaurants at its price range in the Scottsdale area.   Pros: most dishes have good flavor and come with large servings. The restaurant uses a lighter sauce than what you will get at Pei Wei or Panda Express so you don't feel bloated after a full meal.   Cons: some dishes lack a distinct flavor so you leave  feeling underwhelmed. Stick to the main entrees and you will be fine."}
{"text":"This was my first time here and I will definitely be back. There is a great selection off various dishes and it allows you to eat light yet enjoy the deeper taste that this cuisine offers. I had the Szechwan egg plant with chicken and it was fantastic. The owner was a great guy and the place was clean and well kept."}
{"text":"Best Chinese food in my LIFE.   Is that going too far? I don't care, because I love this place! I grew up eating here, and now I come here every single time I visit Scottsdale - AND I recommend it to everyone I know who visits as well. I've probably eaten twice my weight in Szechuan Stringbeans over the years, and triple my weight in Szechuan Eggplant + Tofu.  Here's why I love it:  It's NOT OILY like most Chinese food places. It TASTES AMAZING (I highly recommend the Szechuan dishes). And they are willing to add or substitute items to your dish to FIT YOUR CRAVINGS. Beat that, Panda Suck-spress! And it's all MADE FRESH and FAST in a hot wok, right there in front of you!  Recommendations: Get the loose-leaf hot tea, it's delicious and served in a fun mug. Get an order of the Szechuan Stringbeans (with your choice of protein, I recommend tofu), and an order of Szechaun Eggplant (also with your choice of protein), and douse everything in some healthy scoops of chili sauce to hike up the spice factor. You'll notice that the Szecuan sauce varies from dish-to-dish. The stringbeans are very sweet and savory with a thin sauce, while the eggplant's sauce is much thicker and more savory. Totally different, but equally delicious.  Having moved to LA, China Lite is like the \"one that got away\" - I measure every other Chinese food restaurant I try up to them, and everyone else can't help but pale in comparison."}
{"text":"This place was recommended to me so I decided to try it out. BIG mistake. I tried their Jampong soup and it was the WORST Jampong and worst soup I have ever had. The noodles weren't fresh...infact they tasted like they had been frozen for 5yrs too long. Extremely mushy and not edible. The soup was bland and was not proper Jampong soup. I think they mixed a couple sauces together with water and called it Jampong. The seafood and beef were dismal and the shrimp that was in the soup wasn't cleaned properly. Please do us all a favor and take this so called Jampong soup off your menu."}
{"text":"The previous owners of China Lite were amazing. They had great food, treated customers as customers should be treated and ran the place amazingly well for only 2 people. Unfortunately since the place is under new ownership, the food has turned into mush that tastes like it was fresh out of the freezer and into the microwave. They got my order wrong, which would have been forgivable if their food didn't taste so downright awful.  I will truly miss this place and their previous owners. Needless to say, that I will not be back to China lite."}
{"text":"I've eaten here a few times and the food is decent, but tonight I'm giving them a 2 star rating because of the pricing and portion size!  Yes, I know the economy sucks right now and some businesses have to increase their prices in order to stay afloat in the water, but this was just plain crazy!  I paid over $10 for a dinner order of honey crispy shrimp that came in a to-go container that looked like a child-size to-go container!  I ordered it with brown rice, which made it go over the 10 dollar mark.  A few of my shrimps still had shell on them too, yuck. This place could use some remodeling (I don't recommend eating-in because the ambiance sucks and the soy sauce containers are literally stuck to the table.)   I hate to say it (because I prefer to support local businesses), but if you're in the mood for take-out Chinese, you might as well hit up Panda Express - it's cleaner, fresher, and more reasonably priced!"}
{"text":"Newly remodeled. Sleek new look. Got the sweet and sour chicken and it was really good. It's not your typical sweet and sour dish with the red sauce. It's lighter and you can taste more of the vegetables and chicken. The sauce doesn't mask everything. Service was great. And the large drinks are really large! Which is great because I'm a soda guru! :)"}
{"text":"I came here after a run w/a couple friends (one of which frequents China Lite quite a bit) & I liked it.   I really like Chinese places like this (fast, casual...step above a Panda Express, but not a PF Chang's). I feel like Chinese restaurants like this are far & few in between in the Phoenix area.  We were the only ones in the restaurant, which is small, but clean. There's also a TV, which was showing Diners, Drive-Ins & Dives. Our waitress (who I'm guessing is part of the family who owns the place) was friendly.  I got the honey chicken, which was really good! The chicken was a LITTLE dry, but the sauce was tasty & not too over-powering. It was a pretty good sized portion, but I (sheepishly) finished the whole thing. My dining companions ordered whatever tofu/veggie meal is called. She seemed to really like it. The other two dining companions split the lettuce wraps & orange chicken. They thought the lettuce wraps were just okay, but seemed to like the orange chicken (they said it had a little kick to it).  I'm not generally in this area, but if I were I'd come back to China Lite."}
{"text":"Great quick Chinese food restaurant. Food was legit, fast and cheap. I had lettuce wraps and eggplant with chicken, plenty of food and both were flavorful and delicious! Will be back for sure."}
{"text":"Have come in here a couple times in the last few months.  First, Sarah know my favorites already.  Which I consider great customer service.  The food is lite like the namesake.  It's not like other Asian restaurants, especially the faux Asian rot-gut at  PeiWei.  And, this is one of the few Chinese restaurants where the food doesn't turn my insides out after eating.  The owner told me he doesn't use MSG.  The service is fast and courteous.  The prices are great.  Lunch or supper, if you're looking for good Asian/Chinese food in Scottsdale, this is it."}
{"text":"I really miss this place!  So sad to see it close.  Anyone know what happen?  The note on the door read death in the family?  Still waiting for the re-open? Called a over a week ago and the gentleman said in a week they were ironing out the details?"}
{"text":"I love the food and the owners.  Great lunch specials - especially the garlic chicken."}
{"text":"The Chinese food here is legit. It is all hand made by a single chef. He menu will always have something new on it. Very delicious.   It isn't the mass produced type of Chinese food you see from most Chinese places in America."}
{"text":"I've come here a few times for lunch during the week and I really like it. It's quick, tasty and inexpensive. I really like that they don't use a lot of salt and most of the food is pretty \"lite.\" The Mongolian beef is probably my favorite but I've had a couple of other things on the menu. The fried rice is a little bland but truthfully I'm glad because then I can skip it and save the calories. I also like that the owners are pretty much always there and are very friendly. If you're in the area and need something quick this is a great little spot."}
{"text":"Whenever we are craving Chinese food, this is where we come. The chow mein noodles are awesome, their fried rice is the best in town. And their chicken curry is delicious. Highly recommend it!!!!"}
{"text":"My husband and I picked-up take-out from here last night for ourselves and my in-laws. We had the Cashew Chicken, Mongolian Beef (one plain order/one spicy) and Lite Chicken. We served it family style and everyone was delighted. It was all delicious!!! Great flavor, pricing and portion size. A healthier take on the traditional; we will absolutely be going back!"}
{"text":"It been a while since coming but that's only because we live almost 40 miles from here, and not for any other reason.  The food was as great as it has been in the past, the smell of fresh cooked food inside and out.   Now they just need to duplicate themselves on the west side of Phoenix.   This is one of those great finds in a restaurant"}
{"text":"I don't understand why people call the food bland. If you want flavor full chinese food go to PF Chang's, but expect the heavy doses of salt, butter, unsaturated fats and other stuff. For me they deliver exactly what they promise, good food, low calories and salt, with very little fat. Unlike a meal at PF Chang's you the food settles in your stomach without that heavy feeling.  I eat here often."}
{"text":"I really like the food here - it's well prepared with quality ingredients. Not much on atmosphere (unless you like dining on picnic benches under the glow of florescent lighting), so it's best to call ahead and take it home with you."}
{"text":"I'm a fan of China Lite. It's take out focused (though has eat in option) and is healthy/semi-healthy Chinese fast food.  Our office is about 100 yards away so we go there often. Pretty much our quick & cheap go to lunch spot. Good food, reasonable, quick and they have a number of healthy options.  Feels at least partly authentic though they do also have several \"American Chinese\" selections (which I can also enjoy). I'm a big fan of the Szechuan green bean with chicken but sometimes need a good Sargent Chang's chicken or a honey crispy chicken.  My pops is from Canton, China so Chinese food is something we've grown up with. While it is take out/fast food focused, definitely a viable option."}
{"text":"Tried this place for the first time. Ok menu would have been better with more options. Food was good with a lot of great flavor. Would dine there again but would get it as take out."}
{"text":"China Lite is reopening soon.  3 new signs have been placed on the window in the last few days."}
{"text":"Had lunch there today. The fried rice was served cold, the vegetables limp and the chicken dry and flavorless. Won't return."}
{"text":"Traditional strip mall Chinese fare. The wonton soup was interesting, lettuce and celery bits in it, but only one or two wontons in the one size that they offer. Chicken fried rice was a lot of fried rice, beans sprouts, and a couple large pieces of chicken. Not terrible, but not great either. I ordered takeout, but the seating area looked fine if a bit small."}
{"text":"I can't remember how long I had been going to China Lite but it was a great local Chinese restaurant with healthy options like steamed vegetables etc. The place recently reopened and I was excited to go back. Sadly the previous owners sold the place and the food is no longer the same. One item on the old menu is no longer an option. One meal I ordered was stir fried, not steamed and another vegetable dish I ordered was half the size compared to how it was prepared before. Time to find a new place."}
{"text":"Interesting place. In a small strip mall. People were super nice. Like that they had individual won ton soup and hot sour soup. The chow fun and daan daan mein were a little salty for my taste and a little oily. However they were very accommodating and the flavors were good overall. Staff was very nice and helpful."}
{"text":"I stopped by at China Lite last night to pick up my favorite orange chicken and crab wonton cream cheese.  I am so glad that China Lite is finally opening again!  The hours are from Monday through Saturday from 11am to 9pm.  Also they are also having boba tea which are perfect for summer!!!  So glad that China Lite just reopened!!!"}
{"text":"Good quick Chinese food place with healthy options. They do the basic meals as you would expect from a local Chinese restaurant. It doesn't have a nice interior, but it's good enough for a quick lunch or dinner. It's about as good as you can get for takeout Chinese food type places, and the healthy options are really convenient."}
