{"text":"While walking down the strip looking for a place to have a drink we came across Alexxa's.  It was happy hour (3-6pm) and there were open tables along the strip, sounded perfect to us!  We ordered the celebration punch bowl (20% off during happy hour) for my husband and I to share.  The drink was DELICIOUS!  We were worried it would be too sweet, but it was light and refreshing.  Bonus that it was filled with fresh fruit.  Such a delicious cocktail... we easily drank the whole thing between the 2 of us!  The atmosphere was fantastic being along the strip and able to enjoy the misters.  Music was great.  Our only regret was that we didn't find this gem until our last night in town.  We didn't eat, but all of the food we saw going by looked fantastic.  I hope you go, get the punch bowl, and enjoy!"}
{"text":"I think this has to be my favorite place that I've been to since moving here. Our server, i believe her name was Jan never left us unnoticed. Very attentive and knowledgeable of the menu. If i had to say anything memorable, it'd had to be our sweet server Jan. If you're planning on dining in or just going to have a few drinks. I don't think this place will disappoint. I will definitely be returning soon!"}
{"text":"Food and drinks are amazing! Great music and good vide with attentive Service. Super cool window showing their HeXx chocolate being made. All around a great place to eat and drink."}
{"text":"Just had my first visit to Vegas and went here because it was close to our hotel and had a patio. The food was phenomenal! I got the carbonara pasta hat had a deep fried egg on top- AMAZING! Also got the fried cheese or Something it was a cheese dip with fig jelly in it- best combo of sweet and savory that I could ever imagine! I would've gone to get those meals every night if my trip buddies would've let me."}
{"text":"Fun options for sangrias and awesome punch bowls! Cool atmosphere and Hexx Resturant is adjacent to it , which has amazing food as well. Cool vibes!"}
{"text":"Fun, brand new brunch spot on the strip! Excellent sangria flight!!! Both had protein omelette and were pleased. Could have done without the chicken but still very good!!! Very impressive for first day open!"}
{"text":"Really confusing set up, the Alexxa menu is only offered at one bar within hex and even at that bar we had to specifically ask for that menu. The food is pretty decent but the service left a lot to be desired."}
{"text":"Do not purchase the Travel Zoo voucher. I had read that people had issues using the voucher so I was not surprised that after making a reservation and mentioning the voucher, we were told on check in they would not honour the voucher due to it being a \"holiday\"- the holiday being Father's Day. The place was completely empty at 6PM on a Sunday evening and as we are from out of town we did ask to speak to a manager and they ended up honouring the voucher for us. The server at our table was friendly but not overly attentive and the atmosphere and service felt incredibly pretentious. The food and drinks were very good which is why I've decided to give 3 stars. I would not return or recommend to others."}
{"text":"Food and waiting service were ok but we got taken by their offer from travelzoo. Instead of taking off the 4 appetizers and 2 drinks out of the bill, they just took the $59 which I have paid to travelzoo already for the certificate. Ended up paying the full bill without the special... management needs to learn how to handle offers that was advertised before serving the public. Leaving us with a bad taste from our experience here."}
{"text":"Devin our server was awesome!  Great table, great service. Awesome sangria- pinky swear!  Also, try the colossal Bloody Mary!  It's a meal!"}
{"text":"I don't usually write reviews but because of the experience we had at Alexxa I had to write. The food was great, the atmosphere was fun but the service by far steals the show.   It will surpass your expectations so much that you will not want to leave.  Our server Jasmine was adorable and full of personality.  She was attentive, personable and very efficient.  We took full advantage of the superb recommendations she made.   My friends had a punch bowl to start off with and I had their Mai Tai which was so delicious words fail me.  The ceviche and rolled shredded short rib tacos are to die for. We were able to order from the Hexx menu and I decided on the veal with the wild mushroom risotto... IT WAS PHENOMENAL!!   Jasmine is a huge asset to your restaurant and deserves much kudos!  We will definitely be back with a larger group of friends!"}
{"text":"We went for \"brunch\" around 11:30 on a Friday morning and the wait was about 10 minutes. The waitress did take awhile to get to our table (about 10-15 minutes) but was friendly and our order was correct. The food was fabulous! The sangria's were amazing! If you're looking for a reasonably priced place to eat with a great view of the Bellagio or decor, you won't be disappointed here!"}
{"text":"Great new place with an awesome sangria bar! Staff is attentive and friendly. The punch bowls are delicious and presentation is beautiful. Hexx restaurant is right next door and the food is delicious. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"I am so happy that Hexx decided to turn their retail shop in to Alexxa's Bar! It's a fun extension of all the things we know and love about Hexx. For anyone that wants to forgo the sit down full meal experience (although I don't know why unless you're already full, or on a time limit) this spot is PERFECTION for going in for a cocktail. Don't worry, if you ARE hungry there are tapas! There's a bit of a different vibe which is super fun. I recommend this spot for any meet ups with friends on the Strip. Get the punch bowl fo sho!"}
{"text":"When you and your pals can share fun cocktails and laughs! The drinks are delish and look good too!!"}
{"text":"Living in Vegas and finding new spots for dinner and good cocktails is always a mission. Found this gem because well the chocolate factory! So cool! But the prices on amazing sangrias ! We started with a flight of 3 sangria choices, our waitress Dominique (spelling maybe wrong) picked her favorites. And they were worth it! The bubbles one was my favorite. We chose to use the entree menu, my boyfriend loves the artichoke dip, as did I. We shared the pasta with an amazing breaded egg to mix into the sauce. I got the salmon, and the waitress did suggest the mushroom risotto instead of the usual side. TO DIE FOR! Will be coming back , we have to try the brunch time. She mentioned crazy bloody Mary's and bottomless mimosas. Thank you for amazing date night and service!"}
{"text":"Pretty sure this used to be a candy store...but this place is better.  We sampled about 5 different vegetarian tapas dishes and liked them all. Prices are in line with comparable places.  This is right next to HEXX in Paris..service is slower here than at HEXX but it is a more relaxed place.  Def a nice place to grab a bite/drink when you need a break from the sometimes packed strip."}
{"text":"It was a fail...yelp indicates that this was a tapa bar..went our way to eat there and there was no single tapas in the menu!!  We had to settle for dimsum instead! It was very frustrating!!"}
{"text":"This was a great find! Live music and a view of the Bellagio fountains. You can order off the Alexxa menu or the Hexx menu, and we did a little of both. Husband really wanted some prime rib while in Vegas and we weren't dressed up enough or organized enough to go to Gordon Ramsey or any of the other fancy schmancy options around. The prime rib here was a very generous portion and was cooked perfectly. I thought the crushed garlic/nut (?) topping was too heavily salted but was tasty in small bites. We also had a Thai curry crab cake and the brussel sprouts which were a bit oily but a nice orange-balsamic flavor. Overall very reasonably priced meal and a fun Vegas experience. We would come back!"}
{"text":"I really love the layout and décor of this place.   It never really got busy the entire time we were there though.    The good:  The food is tapas style, and we ordered a lot!!  Everything we ate was delicious.   Portions were pretty big for tapas, and prices were average.  Service was kind of sucky, especially since it wasn't busy.  The sangria flight was a good deal - and tasty.  The punch bowl was a complete rip off.  I like the concept, but it was filled with so much ice.  It did not serve 6 people.  Two of us drank it, and had 2 glasses each.  It was just ok.   Do not spend $48 on this.  Get the flight!  I will be back - hopefully this place sticks around."}
{"text":"After a wonderful night of drinking and night club hopping. We fell upon this restaurant with a sign advertising 10 dollar late night breakfast and let me say it was the best decision ever! Our server Andrew was wonderful and the food was phenomenal! Totally worth the $10. I'd pay 15 for this meal! Just fantastic!"}
{"text":"Note- when making reservations be clear that you want Alexxa's not Hexx which is attached in the same location. The website automatically reserved a table at Hexx.   We ordered a ton of small plates and sangria and ALL of it was good! I think we tried every type of sangria they offered and were happy with everything. My favorite tapas were the baked cheese and the prime rib sliders.   I would definitely go back but I would give more time to eat and enjoy the drinks and atmosphere, service is kinda slow so 1.5 hours wasn't long enough."}
{"text":"Now this is the place to go for a foodie nightcap. My wife and i enjoyed a beautiful fig jam and goat cheese chicken sausage flatbread along with the fried chicken sliders. OMG soooo good.  There was also a few drunk and disorderly people on the strip at that hour, and the management and security handled the situation with class and diligence.   Well done! Would love to go back..."}
{"text":"When HeXx boarded up the retail shop at the end of 2017 it finally shed any semblance to its Sugar Factory roots and with friends in town staying at Paris Las Vegas Hotel & Casino it seemed a perfect opportunity to check out Alexxa's Bar, the food from Matt Silverman, Matt Piekarski and Carlos Buscaglia just as interesting and varied as HeXx's while Pastry Chef Miranda Prince's new Desserts are another welcome addition.  Officially opened on New Year's Eve as a Bar and spill-over for HeXx during busy Brunch hours, the space virtually unrecognizable from its previous incarnation with a lengthy bar lined in housemade Sangrias to one side and a DJ booth to the other, it was minutes prior to 11am reservations that guests were seated at an oval table in the center of the room, music thumping overhead and the vibe a bit more 'buzzy' than next door despite a much lower volume of diners.  Seeing several familiar faces plus a few new ones over the course of a two-hour Brunch, items from the HeXx menu available inside Alexxa's Bar but not vice versa, it was while chatting that Drinks were ordered including Coffee , two batched Sangrias and housemade Cola bright with Cardamom, the later probably not ideal for a ten year old and something the server probably should have made known, though her ability to gauge the needs of a table in terms of refills and share plates also appeared compromised throughout most of the meal.  Differentiating Alexxa's Bar from HeXx by dubbing the former a share-plates or Tapas venue, the cuisine and atmosphere well-suited as a spot to grab a Drink before dining at HeXx or for light bites before a club or show, it was taking advantage of the cross-over menu that Brunch began with two favorites from HeXx before a baker's dozen of Alexxa's plates, the Cinnaroll Waffle and Carrot Cake Pancakes every bit as good as in the past but probably best saved until the end of the meal for most to avoid filling up.  Ordering in rounds to best gauge hunger and portion sizes, the plates ranging $8-$15 depending more on ingredient quality than quantity, first bites of Alexxa's food were comprised of four Taquitos stuffed with Short Rib and Cheese plus a side of smoky Salsa alongside $7/ea Ahi Tuna Tacos and fried Chicken Bao, the latter an early highlight thanks to vibrant Slaw and Bird rich with spices while the Tuna seems a little overpriced and not particularly memorable save for, perhaps, the Taro Shell.  Dividing the menu into five sections, Warm, Cold, Dips, Flatbreads and Desserts, it was for round two that both portions and presentation grew to better match qualities exhibited by the kitchen at HeXx, Chef Buscaglia's quartet of spicy Pork Meatballs tender and juicy atop cooling Yogurt while the Baked Cheese and Whipped Feta each embodied a different end of Dips, the former carefully sweetened and rich with thick Toast to match while the Goat Cheese was light and aromatic with soft Pita that makes it well-suited for smaller appetites.  Going one more round before an all-in approach to Dessert it was alongside two Flatbreads that Falafel a bit smaller than most were presented, the disproportionate surface area making them a bit too crunchy to be fully appreciated while deciding between Squash or Chicken Sausage Flatbread is largely a matter of personal preference, though a crisp Puff Pastry Crust and elegant balance of sweet and savory on both puts one of each into consideration at the expense of items from the menu's other segments.  Turning the afternoon over to Chef Prince at this point, Alexxa's Desserts priced similar to those at HeXx though at times a bit smaller, it was with a new Crème Brulee from next door that things got started, the intensely dark Chocolate playing well off Citrus segments and Cake slices while HeXx's Chocolate was also featured as a dip next to feather-light Churros that fared equally well in Whisky Caramel.  Working slowly at this point as volume grew louder, both HeXx and Alexxa nearly filled to capacity by 12:30pm, it was with a bit of disappointment that $3/ea \"Pie Pops\" were served as half-dome Mignardises resistant to sharing while Chocolate Cannolis proved far better at less cost, though if one were forced to select just one Dessert at Alexxa's Bar the coin-toss should come down to Mango Spring Rolls or the Butterscotch Pot de Crème, both excellent with the former mild yet complex in terms of taste as well as texture while the Pudding one-ups others in town as a spread for toasted Broche Muffins.  ****Just launching the menu last week and still a work in progress as relates to service, the primary servers and bussers simply not communicating enough it seems, Alexxa's Bar adds another dimension to the HeXx experience that should work well in its intended role, though one does wonder long-term how the spaces will come to be differentiated given the ability for menu cross-over plus a shared entrance."}
{"text":"Awesome start to our Vegas vacation. We walked by this place and liked the patio space, so we gave it a shot - happy we did. Tapas menu was bomb. We had the rolled crispy beef tacos, crunchy macaroni and cheese (liked a fried macaroni ball), and the prosciutto flatbread. Couldn't even tell you which was our favorite because they were all great. Flatbread had 3 pieces and the other two tapas both had 4 pieces; perfect amount for two people. Add two drinks and our bill was only $60. Quick service, nice waitstaff ... they kept the water cups filled.  definitely would recommend."}
{"text":"Terrible place. Management is rude. Food was spectacular and service from the rest of the staff were awesome but managers are stuck up and they are prejudice to young people. My friends and I were ignored and disrespected when we wanted to place an order of drinks. Even the waiter that was serving us had to apologized for the nonsense because the manager couldn't give us a reason to why we couldn't be served. Just awful, save your money. Tipped more than 20 percent of the bill and after we paid that's when they kicked us out and threatened us that we were trespassing."}
