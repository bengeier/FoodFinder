{"text":"DO NOT ORDER PIZZA FROM THIS PLACE !!!  The franchise owner \"John\" promised a simple replacement pizza for the soggy, undercooked and room temprature pizza I paid for. After 3 subsequent calls to complain and being promised I'd get a \"correct\" pizza, nothing has been done. John promised today (my third call) that he'd follow through with a letter to me after he blamed his staff. Come on ... take responsibility and maybe attempt recovery.This place is Horrible and I'm 100% convinced that the Franchise Owner, \"John\" is to blame. Not the staff. I've contacted the Corporate Office about the lack of follow through and disengaged attitude of \"John\". What a joke   over a $20 pizza."}
{"text":"Good deals, but ridiculous delivery times. Waiting an hour every time I order isn't worth it."}
{"text":"very disappointed.  I did a preorder to arrive at 1:00pm.  have done this before and was on time and  food was hot. I live less than 1/2 mile away.  when I called the woman at the shop, she didn't even have my name or record of my order.  they showed up 20 min late while I was on the phone with the shop,  food was cold. the chicken poppers, on top of being cold, were missing the cheese sauce I ordered with it.  overall not worth it  especially if I am paying for delivery and a tip up front."}
{"text":"never yelp'd before but service by this manager was so bad, needed to let people know 8:47p called and ordered 2 pizzas including pepperoni and canadian bacon, when she confirmed the order, she said bacon and pepperoni, i said canadian bacon and pepperoni 9:22 wrong pizza delivered, received bacon peppori, called back and Alan answered, said she didn't know to substitute ham for canadian bacon 10:03 called back when pizza never received, Ashley answered, said the reorder was never placed, I asked to speak to manager and was left on hold 10:10 called back after being left on hold, Ashely answered, left on hold again 10:14 called back, Alan answered, let him know reoder was never submitted, said \"really?\", I asked to speak to manager and asked for name of manager, was told ASHLEY IS THE MANAGER, I asked for the name of manager of store and was told PJ or Ignacio, I asked to speak to one of them was left on hold again 10:19 after being left on hold, called back, Samantha answered, asked if my reoder had been submitted, she said she \"would make it herself if she needed to\" (which was nice), I asked for Ashley and not to be placed on hold, Ashley came to phone, let her know I was told SHE WAS THE MANAGER and that she had left me on hold, she thought I wanted to speak to another manager, I asked to speak to PJ or Ignacio, and was told they are NOT EVEN THERE 10:30 WRONG PIZZA DELIVERED AGAIN, PINEAPPLE AND HAM???!!! I gave the driver, Shawn, both wrong pizzas back and told him I would be calling to speak to store manager tomorrow  Next day, called to speak to PJ or Ignacio, explained what happened and was told ASHLEY IS THE STORE MANAGER!!!  I got the corporate number and will be calling them on Monday  I will not be ordering from Papa Johns again and will be trying local pizza"}
{"text":"Picked up a pan pizza I ordered online, it was burnt and Nate, the branch manager, said that it was normal to be burned like that and he cannot do anything about it, he even threathen me to call the security and I told him call the cops instead so they can see if I am right or wrong."}
{"text":"E-mail offer for a med 5 topping pizza and 6 pepperoni knots for $10.00  We tried it, and it was O.K. When I picked up the food, it was sitting on a shelf with no heating element to keep the pizza or knots warm. When I got it home, it was cold Not impressed. Will probably stick with the Hut."}
{"text":"I ordered from this store online and they screwed up my order. I called and spoke to manager Mike and he hung up on me because I wanted a refund instead of a credit. I called back and he admitted he hung up on me and said \"the conversation was over.\" He's not management material and what good is a pizza store that can't make an order correctly?"}
{"text":"First time trying Papa John's under recommendation from a friend.  Placed the order online, mobile site was easy to navigate.  Confirmation said order would be delivered in 40-50 minutes.  Driver called 50 minutes later with broken English that was not understandable. I re-confirmed my address since it sounds like he couldn't find my apartment building.  Told the driver I would meet him out front.  Waited outside for about 10 minutes and he finally appears with my order.  When we got back to the apartment, we realized the food was ice cold.  Definitely NOT impressed and would forewarn anyone getting delivery here.    I'd be able to pick up my pizza, walk back to my apartment and the pizza would probably still be warmer than how it arrived."}
{"text":"The quality of food is significantly less than other Papa John's restaurants, which on the whole is still a worse value than other local establishments."}
{"text":"Good service, GREAT food, just harder to order on phone then online + order online 3 weeks in advance!"}
{"text":"I was looking up papa johns to order some pizza and I saw some really bad reviews on google so I was second guessing ordering from here but my friend from to Tucson and says they have really good pizza so I order the pizza anyway and it was the best pizza I've ever had! ( they were saying they got sick and they were throwing up and not only on just 1 review) I don't know what the people on google were talking about but I will definitely be ordering pizza from papa johns again!"}
{"text":"I would like to think Papa John's for donating pizzas to feed our troops when we are selling popcorn at Fry's thank you very much."}
{"text":"Alright this is my go to pizza place, I always order online to collect their rewards program.   The place is clean and my orders have always been correct.  The parking lot here though is a pain in the butt, I don't know why but its always so busy!  Their pizza always sits well with me, I don't get that greasy feeling or aftertaste.  Also don't get killer heart burn from here either.   The staff here are generally good.     This isn't their fault but their online ordering system does not allow for you to identify which dip you want with your order.  You can only select if you order extra dip at a cost but not the free dip.  You need to tell them which dip you want when you get there or call in after you place your online order which defeats the purpose.  The default dip is a garlic butter that is overly salty, so make sure to ask for a different one if that doesn't float your boat."}
{"text":"I ordered delivery from a nearby hotel and was surprised at how polite the customer service was over the phone. They said my Works pizza and drinks would arrive in about 30-45 mins. Not 20 mins later they delivered my pizza perfectly hot and tasty! Keep up the good service!!"}
{"text":"Good food and free pizza is always awesome! Drivers on the other hand speed in my neighborhood and drive like maniacs!"}
{"text":"I love this Papa John's! My orders from them have been problemless! I've ordered using the phone and online. Love the pizza too!  The staff I've encountered is courteous, helpful, and respectful from the person taking my order, to the delivery girls and guys!  The website was user friendly as well. Dody is fabulous and funny (you had me laughing on the phone girl), Anthony is kind, respectful, and professional, and Alex is very helpful going above and beyond. Hey Papa John's, give Dody Anthony, and Alex a raise!!  BTW, I have zero affiliation with Papa John's. I don't usually write reviews (you can see this is only my 2nd review). This is an honest review of my experience. When I came to Yelp to write the review, I was shocked at all the negative comments. Well, I can only speak on my own experience which has been great!!"}
{"text":"Pizza was wonderful; however, management needs to get it together. I went to pick up my pizza when it was supposed to be ready and had to wait another 10 minutes because there was ONE person working (cooking, taking phone calls, running the cash register, etc.). The guy working did a great job, was apologetic, and really is a rock star. I assume at least one person was making deliveries, but having one person at the store is just not enough on a Saturday."}
{"text":"Beware of this location. I thought I would put a review up before I made the call. I placed an order online over an hour ago for me and my kid. This pizza is chewy, crunchy toppings, and COLD!!!! Seriously??? $22.50 for a damn pizza and we get it cold? BS, calling corporate. Don't eat here"}
{"text":"Don't try to call for delivery because you will only get the run around. Call for pick up and be sure to order the double burger pizza. It's surprisingly awesome"}
{"text":"No Go! I cannot stress this enough. Please. Don't. Throw up on cardboard. Even if you're a freegan, please don't."}
{"text":"Greek pizza was really good tonight. I ordered mine with chicken instead of pepperoni and the website didn't charge for the edit (awesome). Friendly store employees."}
{"text":"This Papa John's location is our regular location for ordering pizza. My girlfriend and I have been very satisfied with their service. They have a very friendly staff and are very fast at delivering without compromising the quality of the food. There have been a few times where they accidentally put pepperoni on our entire pizza when we always order half pepperoni because my girlfriend is a vegetarian but in both occasions they immediately sent us another pizza with the correct toppings free of charge. We understand accidents happen but we are primarily happy with the way they correct them."}
{"text":"On average it takes about 1hr+ to get your delivery. Pizza is consistently OK. Had a driver call me once that he forgot half the order and had to go back...."}
{"text":"Very disappointed that we didn't get all of our order. I ordered 1 lg 1 lg for .30 and our free pizza. the 2 pizza's came but the last one never did. Delivery guy said he was going back to store and would be back with our free pizza NEVER Happened, Very unhappy customer. might have to change pizza companies or change to carry out and change stores..."}
{"text":"I drive a little out of my way to go to this location since they are open later for carryout than the Papa John's closest to me. After my first visit to this location I was called and given a free promotion for my next order which was great. Also, the manager TJ is very friendly!"}
{"text":"Respectable employees and food. If there's an issue with the order, they will make it right."}
{"text":"Took an hour and a half to get to my door and when I finally took a bite, the pizza wasn't cooked through and was actually raw. Ordered extra toppings and they weren't even put on but was still charged for it. All in all, don't bother, it's best to just avoid this location all together."}
{"text":"Baba probably ordered on a Badger game day when it does take most food places over an hour for delivery.  great customer service and just what i wanted"}
{"text":"Whenever I get that unbearable urge to dig into an authentic classic pizza pie, nothing screams quality and assurance quite like a papa johns pizza. The medley of the highest quality ingredients woven into the top notch service and dependability is what has forged the perfection that is a papa johns pizza. Papa john has been whipping up these pizza pies from scratch since day one and you can taste that quality with every bite and smell that erupts from a papa johns pizza. The official pizza of the Diamondbacks is papa johns pizza. Papa johns pizza comes to your door piping hot with quality and a smile from a certified papa johns representative. Good old papa johns. Papa johns. Skip breakfast lunch and dinner and just order a papa johns pizza right now. Papa johns!"}
{"text":"Bad service .. Called to place a delivery and i called the wrong location .. They gave me the phone number for the closes store nearest me .. Only they said it so fast that no one could possibly remember .. I ask for it again and they hung up on me .. What a jerk"}
{"text":"Wow!....it is so interesting to read the reviews for this Papa John as either 1's or 5's....We have used this same location for years and they have almost always been topnotch , quick, and friendly.....maybe because we are frequent users and they get to know us....with a little communication like please, & thank yous go a long way, especially in this city.."}
{"text":"Im not surprised this papa johns doesnt have a good rating. They have HORRIBLE customer service. This was my experience last night. My husband ordered from there via internet last night. He place the order while i was sleeping, and didnt think to tell me. Thats a problem. So i wake up to someone knocking on my door, i didnt answer. I am a recluse, tbh, and i dont answer the door unless i know who is there. My husband fell asleep. So he wakes up, realizing he did fuck up. WE FUCKED UP, i know this, but here is where theyre horrible customer service comes into play. My husband call them back, they say the order was voided out, but that they will send it again. So we wait, one hour goes by nothing, check the order online, says its still in the process of being delivered. wait another 30 mins nothing. So my husband calls, the guy fucking tells us that they did come out again, Which they absolutely did NOT i had my door open, with the screen shut, and half the time i was waiting outside not wanting to miss them again. So the guy tells my husband that he will just have the driver come out one more time, and if we are not there they wont deliver to us ever again, BUT the guy who apparent came the first time starts screaming in the background and cursing that he isnt fucking going anywhere UNTIL MY  HUSBAND GIVES HIM HIS CREDIT CARD NUMBER! WTF kinda shit is that?  HORRIBLE HORRIBLE HORRIBLE service, and i wouldnt be surprised if the lousy ppl there steal ppls credit card numbers on top of it. Shady af if u ask me."}
{"text":"The thin crust tastes and looks like soda crackers and it arrived cold. Not a good first impression!"}
{"text":"We've been ordering here for almost two years now. Always delivery. And we've tried a few different recipes, all of them amazing. Their delivery service is always on time, pleasant, and focused. There's at least two delivery persons who frequent in our area, and I wish I knew their names, but they are some cool people!"}
{"text":"Went in after along day of work to get a good pizza.. After watching the employees eat food with their fingers and not washing their hands after turned me off.. But thats not it..they had their own drinks on the same counter where the pizza crust lays..who knows what is on the bottom of those cups.. Dont even want to give them a star..so gross waste of 25 dollars cause we threw the pizza  away.."}
{"text":"Only one star because 0 stars isn't an option   I arrived late due to nightmare traffic on I-15 and nearly everything was closed. Despite my deeply held loathing for Papa John's (issues with them honoring their own coupons) I called them anyway to order two cheese pizzas for pickup. I was informed that I could wait 90 minutes for delivery but couldn't drive there and pick them up. Huh?  I was told its a safety issue. But it's perfectly safe to send drivers out at night?  Morons. They just confirmed everything I hate about Papa John's.  I've never wanted to see a company go out of business so badly as I do Papa John's."}
{"text":"First time ordering from this location...and most likely my last. This review is based on the delivery and customer service, not the food. I use to deliver pizza when I was younger (before everyone had GPS on there phone) and if I was lost, I either called my boss or the customer to get directions so I could get there on time...no excuses for a cold pizza nowadays in my opinion. Well, to start things out...the driver took an hour and 20 minutes to deliver, didn't have my credit card receipt, then wanted to copy down my whole credit card number! I wasn't ok with that...(I started calling the store to confirm that policy and then she changed her story and said she only needed the last 4 digits!) and to top it off...she didn't even have a pen for me to sign her delivery receipt! So I was left with a cold pizza, cold chicken poppers, no receipt for my transaction and a bad taste in my mouth about Papa John's. I use to love this pizza, but today made me reconsider that. There's way too many choices in pizza to have to put up with this kind of service. I called the store after the driver left and the manager was apologetic and offered a free pizza on my next order but it didn't make up for the fact that my dinner was ruined. I gave it two stars because I'm sure the food would have been fine had it been hot. Customer service can make or break a business. I hope they figure that out soon over there."}
{"text":"good pizza , pretty good service except sometimes they take a lil longer than they say for delivery, I love the bread sticks tho, and the extra sauce that comes with"}
{"text":"They had mushrooms when Dominoes did not. Also they have made it within 40mins or less the past 8 times. Try the garden fresh thin crust"}
{"text":"I love papa johns pizza! I haven't been inside to the restaurant since I always order delivery. We get fast delivery and very hot delicious pizza. Always an accurate order. And coupons! I always find one to use"}
{"text":"I don't generally eat at Papa Johns, but when ordering for delivery, this location is the quickest and most reasonable for pricing.  The estimated delivery time is always spot on, and even during dinner rush, is to my house within an hour."}
{"text":"This place is below average when it comes to service & pizza's. I've ordered here on a few occasions & everytime it had taken over an hour for a small delivery. What makes it even worse, is I live less that 1 mile away from the store location. Being disabled, made it very difficult for carry-out. So I recommend taking your business elsewhere, if you want a good pizza & exceptional service."}
{"text":"New to the neighborhood. We order pizza order pizza every Friday night this is the 2nd time from this particular location. First time It took over an hour and a half & when we opened the boxes all of the toppings had slid over to one side. Tonight, our 2nd time, delivery took even longer & they brought the wrong pizza. I don't get it. If you can't take pride in what you do, then quit."}
{"text":"If you have a burning desire to be talked to like a piece of garbage by a pimply-faced teen boy on a power trip, by all means, give this Papa John's a try!  We made an online order of pizza and breadsticks. Nothing difficult. It's Sunday. No Steelers, Pirates, or Pens game. Can't be that busy. Our email confirmation said 30-40 minutes.   After an hour, we call. The order is on it's way, this kid says. A half an hour after that, we call. The same kid explains that the driver got stuck at another location, but assured us he was on his way now. After another 15 minutes, we call again and cancel the order, because at this point our food had been cold for well over 45 minutes.  The kid was such a snot that I'm still upset about it. I hope one day he grows up and becomes a contributing member of society. If you like being treated like a valued customer, I would steer clear of this place.   Off to grab my take order from Slice on Broadway."}
{"text":"Pizza is so so. A bigger problem is that at the College St. location the delivery drivers take up so much parking in the evening that often there is nowhere to park, they even park on the hadicap spot, so I just  go around the corner to  Domino's."}
{"text":"Worse customer experience ever; ordered pizzas for delivery, had an incorrect pizza delivered, when I called to asked for an exchange they told me to accept the mistake; Order Domino's instead, this happened with them previously and Domino's fixed the issue immediately, this Papa Johns just loses repeat customers"}
{"text":"The cashier was very rude . I asked for a military discount and  the guy didn't even give me an explanation at all . He just ignored me . I will never come to this location again ."}
{"text":"Pizza service is great! Better ingredients and most definitely a grand product. Order from here and get fantastic pizza :)"}
{"text":"Terrible delivery service.  I ordered a Papa John's pizza from this location at 4:45pm, a delivery boy came to my residence about 2 hours later and brought me the wrong pizza.  I quickly noticed and gave it back to him and he said that my pizza must be with the other delivery driver.  I called the store and they told me that the other driver would be bringing it to me shortly.  Another hour passed, this is now 3 hours after I ordered and still no pizza.  I repeatedly called the store over the next 3 hours (so now 6 hours after I ordered) and there was a busy signal every single time I called.  I never received the pizza I ordered and never reached anyone from the store.  Absolute worst service I have ever experienced."}
{"text":"People and pizzas there are the best around. Love the crust and cheese bread they sell. Been buying from papa John's for many years."}
{"text":"Literally waited like an hour to get my pizza as they said they would be here in 30 minutes and they're super late also they made me call two different locations and wouldn't accept my coupon unless it was on the website super in convenient"}
{"text":"Love the pizza here one of my favorites! And I love that they always have deals going on!! Staff is always helpful and friendly!! Football and pizza can't beat that!!!"}
{"text":"Online shoppers beware!!!! Prices online are higher than what's advertised in the store. The stores advertise specials are not listed online.   It is very upsetting to come in the store and discovered you just got ripped off."}
{"text":"Worst phone customer service from Iris and Angela, I regret calling in to ask questions about/ modify my order. I was hung up on abruptly as we were trying to figure out what I needed to do to re order because my previous order I put in incorrectly and called right after for help, Angela got frustrated as people in the background kept interrupting her and took it out on me. I called right back after being disconnected for the benefit of the doubt.Angela was apparently a delivery driver and left to run a delivery less than 30 seconds after hanging up on me. I asked to talk to a manager and follow up on my order confusion  to see what was happening with it. Iris stated she was the manager and was apathetic to the fact I was hung up on or what happened and did not take any ownership for what happened and all she could say is I don't know what happened I wasn't there, she told me to cancel your order, which is ultimately what I was trying to do to reorder online to get the points because I'm close to a free pizza, I do not believe that was a manager. I worked in customer service for many different companies and I was appalled at what happened and how this was handled. I would never treat someone like that, even if it was warranted which it wasn't. It was also on speakerphone because my phones messed up and people that were with me were also shocked.. I won't be able to feel the same about ordering from this place for a while. This is my customer service horror story, and it's my first. Thanks. I ordered from the one on Thomas and picked it up rather than put in my correct order online for them to deliver. This was just not right."}
{"text":"There the worst. I ordered extra cheese sausage pepperoni mushrooms Roma tomatoes and green peppers and this is what you get.  I'll never order there again. There soooo cheap like only 4 pieces of sausage 4 mushrooms 4 pieces of tomato 3 pieces of green pepper. There soooo cheap plus they increased the delivery charge and I live maybe 1/2 mike away. Another reason the stock is down 70 million. I'm done with this place."}
{"text":"Went to this location and I was treated like ROYALTY!!! This location is so CLEAN and I would go there anytime. The General Manager is great ...I can always count on her  smile and professionalism. I would highly recommend this  Location to anyone. The food, atmosphere, and people are  wonderful. I am going to make sure that all of my friends and  family write a review about this location. I am just so impressed at how this store is managed....I know Papa has to be  Proud of this location."}
{"text":"I was disappointed to find the chicken margarita pizza that I had delivered appeared to have ingredients only on one side.  The pizza must have slid or tipped to one side and the cheese and toppings slid over.  The delivery driver said nothing.  I regret giving a tip.  The pizza was not very tasty."}
{"text":"The worst customer service ever. Called mgr Taneisha she assured me my pizza was on the way waited an extra 40 mins before it got here. Then it got here and it was the wrong pizza. Called the store back was placed on hold for 15 minutes and then all of a sudden she was no longer there. This is UNACCEPTABLE. Better management is needed. SAD!!!!!"}
{"text":"I order delivery from here all the time. It's always on time, hot when it gets here, and the delivery people are always polite. They also paid attention to the \"crazy dog, call #\" note I used to make and didn't approach the yard-- not all delivery places pay attention to that stuff!"}
{"text":"The pizza is tasty but they are consistently late with delivery. Even if we set a delivery time in advance, they don't stick to it. We just wanted TWO HOURS. Multiple calls to the store and nobody offered an explanation or any consolation. Honestly, when pizza is almost an hour late I expect it to be free."}
{"text":"Whenever we order, we stick with this place.  However, since we are rather cheap we often do pick up.  Pretty fast, and the pizza is usually pretty up to par unlike some franchises *cough* Green Street *cough*"}
{"text":"I was looking for a better pizza than my Little Caesars or Dominos near my home. Being the discounter, I found that Papa John's had a decent pizza for a nice price. I built my pie online and set up a carryout option with cash payment. Soon I received a confirmation email with all my order information and an ETA of about 20 mins or so. I sent my boyfriend within ten mins to go pick our dinner up. When he arrived, the front counter attendant couldn't find our pizza; leaving Joe to wait an additional thirty mins or so. (He was at the correct location) The attendant then handed my boyfriend TWO pizzas. Clearly, not our order!!  After finding what they thought was our pie based on the ingredient selection, it was luke warm at best and had a sticker for a different client and phone number. I was EXTREMELY disappointed with our experience. I never write reviews-certainly not a bad one-; however, I needed to tell you readers.... Rosati's is worth the gas OR try another location."}
{"text":"Horrible. I placed a delivery order at 11:00pm and the order was never delivered. I called around 12:00am to see what was happening, and the call was never answered. Someone kept picking up the phone and hanging it up.  I called the next day to talk to the manager about the situation and he did not seem to care. He didn't offer anything for the inconvenience or apologize about the delivery never arriving. Completely disgusted by the lack of customer service."}
{"text":"The workers are friendly and the food is good (for fast food pizza). But plan on waiting over an hour for delivery and over 35 minutes for pickup."}
{"text":"We can usually count on Papa John's for decent to great pizza no matter where we are in the country.  This was not the case with this location.  The pie was late, the delivery driver was suspicious and borderline rude, and the pizza was terrible.  It was cold and one of the worst pies we've ever had.  You know the saying, \"pizza is always good even when it's bad?\"  This wasn't even true.  Instead it was a waste of out money.  Bleh."}
{"text":"First time ordering from this store and will never order again!!!  Pizza was threw together like they didnt care and toppings were terrible. Customer service was just as bad being i stood there waiting for service and everyone just ignored me...  What a joke of a place!!!  Live and learn..."}
{"text":"Nice people working but order is always late, also the extras for pepperoncini shad lessened, I pay .75 for 3 total. Last order pizza was incorrect from the mobile order and they were accommodating but instead of putting me on hold I could hear the conversation and the manager seemed agitated saying \" what do they want!\" Being short with the nice employee, I wasn't trying to get free food nor was I being rude at all. The girl was very nice but the lack of professionalism with the manager stinks. I order from here often,and it's always a nice experience if something is incorrect but I am unsure how after recent experience"}
{"text":"Well there are only 3 options for this type of pizza delivery. I like the fact that they include dipping sauce with their pizza pies.  The only complaint I have is they are very slow with delivery.  What ever happened to the days of 30 minute delivery or your pizza is free."}
{"text":"I love papa john's pizza, and I really like the location of this one in particular, but this is the worst place ever!! I ordered a large pizza to pick up and I was bringing it to a hotel room to my friends. The cheese on the pizza didn't even melt, it looked like crap, it's nothing like anything type of pizza! We didn't even eat and done nothing about it. Failure!"}
{"text":"Outstanding service from start to finish ! Took my order very quickly and professional Said it would take 35 minutes it took less than that! Tastes great thank you for fast and easy dining. :)"}
{"text":"This place sucks!!!! Order else where. I love papa johns, but this store is terrible. The first time I ordered they undercooked my pizza and it tasted like a digiorno pizza, I gave them a second try, thinking maybe it'll get better, but it was undercooked again and their was a dime laying in my pizza box under my pizza."}
{"text":"I used to call for orders here monthly or more. A delivery with awful food, overcharge, and poor manager response stopped me. I did leave a message for location manager to no avail. Haven't been back since and have not missed it."}
{"text":"Ordered carry out from here. Arrived with a $100 dollar bill and was told we do not take $100 bills. Total bill was $45. When the male cashier told me we do not take $100 he looked over at the girl making pizzas for reassurance on this. The female making pizzas stated the closest place to break the bill is smiths. I then leave papa johns and go over to smiths wait in line to break my bill. I return to papa johns to wait in line cause a large family is ordering and taking their time while the kid that told me they didn't accept the bill just stared at me I finally asked if I could get my pizza. I then asked what's the reasoning for not taking my bill and why is no signage posted. He said cause they get a lot of fake $100 bills. Last I checked there are plenty of fake $5, $10, $20 and $50's out there too. Shouldn't this be part of there training to check if a bill is valid or not. Maybe even invest in a cheap machine that checks bills. I won't be coming back to this papa johns"}
{"text":"The worst ever,I no kidding the worst customer service ever and only about half the time is pizza up to papa johns standard .why corporate has  not  for stepped in to totally clean house is amazing,years ago I quit calling them because they would instantly ask you to hold no matter what time of day you called them, not ever minute of day are they that busy,couple of years go by and  i thought  maybe corporate  came in  replaced the entire staff due to all the negative reviews on yelp and I do. Love papa johns pizza when it's done right so I thought I would give them a second chance since I was going to next closes papa  johns for years on boulder highway, so call in a  order using a coupon issued thru a flyer that states its for carry out only but not an online since some of the coupons do state online only but not this one which I had to argue with the call taker then he said he did not recognize the promo code at all,asked to speak with the manager he was the manager, great job job of corporate over sight guys.this one store could run the whole franchise into the ground."}
{"text":"I've eaten from here twice and everything was ok. Ordered and paid online and the food came pretty quickly. But TODAY there was a hair in my pizza that was UNDER the cheese. We got our money back and ate somewhere else. Again this could have just been a fluke since I've had no problems before but it seriously grossed me out."}
{"text":"I wanted something different. I'm not a big fan of Papa Johns but I was sssoo craving them for some odd reason. So I ordered a lg half chicken/half canadian bacon, other than the portions being VERY meager, it was A GOOD. BUT the pepperoni rolls were EXCEPTIONALLY small & burnt. True there were on special...$5..but didn't  know you had to compromise quality, portion size, & hardly ANY PEPPERONI seeing how they were advertised as PEPPERONI ROLLS!(3 stars for the Pizza & quick services )    PurchaserBeware!!"}
{"text":"I've noticed, over the past few months, a steady decline in the give-a-crap department. I understand being busy, but it would be nice to only have the toppings I request. I just found 10 mushroom pieces and 7 sausage pieces on my ham & pineapple. Please slow down & give a crap... Cross contamination is a serious thing."}
{"text":"online ordering for delivery always on point, regular experience and driver was  appreciative of the tip, tasty"}
{"text":"I like Papa's usually but this one really fell short of late!  Seriously, I've never had so much trouble getting someone to make a half vegetarian half meat pizza!  It's not rocket science.  I understand that people make mistakes but I had ordered from them they had to remake it three times and still got it all wrong.  When I called the same person who took my order (I swear she must have been high), she began to argue with me saying that it was correct and had to go \"talk to the manager\" three times.  She was going to charge me anyways!!!   I could not believe the poor customer service!  I explained to her that I had a vegetarian in the house and have always ordered at least half if not all of the pizzas veggie.  FINALLY the manager got on the phone and he ended up MAILING me a free pizza cert, in the meantime I had to run out and buy a frozen pizza because we had waited an hour for it to arrive and I wasn't going to wait for them to re-make it again!     In short, I like Papa's normally, but I worked for a pizza place in my younger years and the last thing you do when a customer says a pizza is wrong (and they haven't touched it), is defend your order-taking abilities (or lack thereof)!  Who cares pizza girl?!  It costs the company like a dollar to waste a pizza, so just make another!!!!!!"}
{"text":"I order here almost everyday, 99% of the time they are accurate.  When they did, finally, made mistake I called them back and they offered to fix it right away, no questions asked.  I went back for my free pizza today, and OMG! DELICIOUS! Bacon cheeseburger pizza with some jalapenos.  Definitely going back tomorrow!"}
{"text":"I have ordered from eat street a few times and have always got pick up so this review is only about the pick up service.  Each time we have ordered from Papa Johns the drinks that come with our meal are always incorrect or they are out of a certain beverage.  I ordered mountain dew tonight and the staff forgot to place the drinks in the fridge and offered me a warm mountain dew instead.  Tonight we also ordered a 4 piece bread stick combo with a medium Hawaiian pizza.  The pizza was thin crust instead of hand tossed and we didn't receive our garlic sauce with the order.   They usually tend to mess up at least one thing with our order each time we get something."}
{"text":"I prefer papa johns over any pizza place, just certain locations are better than others"}
{"text":"We love Papa John's and order it often!  They always have great deals online and they are so fast at delivering.  When we say we want an order by a certain time they are there on the dot.  Very reliable, great food, excellent service.  Their chipotle and hot wings are exceptionally delicious and I didn't expect that the first time I ordered them."}
{"text":"Is this the quality that Las Vegas has regarding Italian food?? NASTY!! Terrible \"pizza\"... Really? It is a frozen pizza that gets delivered?? I would give no stars.. £u¢k'in yuck."}
{"text":"I have to say, this is a first. I've never had to wait 2 hours to receive a pizza. We were told it was a football night (Thursday? I don't follow football, but okay) and they were short on drivers.  I could have walked there and back several times over and gotten the food myself.  Needless to say, our order was barely warm and can't really vouch for the flavor. Sorry PJ's, we're sticking with Dominoes."}
{"text":"Worst pizza I've ever had in my life.  After reading/hearing all the hype about Papa Johns, we ordered delivery from this location (thanks to the very attractive coupon.)   The result?  A terribly bland pizza with a HUGE, THICK crust that made every bite super bread-y.  The toppings were sparse and everything was very 'dried' and overcooked - certainly nothing like the promo pictures they show you.  Incredibly disappointed with every aspect of this pizza.  I don't even want to try again, in case we got a 'bad' order last time. Sorry Papa Johns, you're not getting any more money me ever.  The worst possible thing I can say about Papa Johns is, \"I'd rather eat at Pizza Pizza.\"  Yuck."}
{"text":"Took forever to get a pizza. No one seems to respond to customers who have been waiting, the employees completely ignore the customers. The drive through is a complete waste. No one even bothers to show up at the window."}
{"text":"My roommate wanted pizza for dinner and since I'm not a pizza person; I thought I'd eat outside the box for New Years. We got one with shroons for her and the other with bacon and vegetables for me. That pizza was sssooo good. It was a hit in this house tonight. I counted 14 employees when picking up the pizzas.  Cuddos to mgmt for having all hands on deck. Thanks for making our last meal of 2015 easy and convenient. Keep up the good work! ;)"}
{"text":"It's convenient to order from this location but now I will drive a few more miles to get some better customer service. The employees here could care less about their jobs and same with the manager. They get orders wrong and if they mess up your order you're responsible to drive back with the food so they could make another order without any refund or discount. Very dirty and unsanitary."}
{"text":"DON'T GO TO THIS LOCATION!!!!!  HORRIBLE SERVICE! I ordered at 5:15 p.m. with delivery and by 8:00 pm there was no sign of my food. I decided to call them for the 2nd time and they had the nerve to say that they would make my order again and send it out so I would have to wait an additional 45 minutes after waiting nearly three hours. My poor kids got so tired of waiting they actually fell asleep without dinner.  I love Papa John's but decided to go with Dominoes on Aliante Parkway. They were amazing! 20 minutes after I placed my order I had my food. Unfortunately my poor kids didn't eat but I recommend  going to another location or just go to Dominoes."}
{"text":"So, up until the last 2 times I've ordered from this place the service has exceeded my expectations. The last 2 times, however, are a test to my loyalty to papa johns. I want better delivery drivers who actually come to the door, not call and say meet me at the front bc I'm lazy, or have me calling to see where the hell my order is, and then get a pizza that's been mishandled delivered late. I'm officially unimpressed guys."}
{"text":"Why do I do it to myself? I know better. 30 minutes late for a stone cold pizza. How about instead of being the official sponsor of NFL, NBA, MLB and underwater basket weaving you try being the official sponsor of delivering a hot pizza on time? That was twice. Won't be a third."}
{"text":"Ordered on line.  Only after they had my money did they say it was going to be \"94-104 minutes\".  Did I order from Milwaukee???  Easier to go to Domino's and pick up."}
{"text":"My mushroom pizza barely had any mushroom on it... We got two pizzas and only one garlic sauce.... And the large pizzas look like Little Caesar's medium... What a rip off!!!!"}
{"text":"Horrible service.....went to store called for pizza gave them an address they called the police because we were outside the door...they did not want to serve anyone a pizza. Never go here unless the owner calls you....they had appoligized to us....this is a horrible location... Never go here"}
{"text":"We were first time customers of Papa John's.  Taken in by the \"better ingredients....\" tag line, we opted to try.  Not a good experience.  The ingredients may be \"better\" but there was so little to the pizza it was shameful.  We could hardly discern any taste to the product.  Price was $10 for a 14\" 2 topping pizza but a bargain is not what you spend, it is what you get.  In the future we will get pizza from Italian restaurants to get something with more substance and taste.."}
{"text":"Extremely rude and unhelpful employee, both over the phone and in person. Great chain, but terrible store. Go to another location or a different pizza company in the area."}
{"text":"The corporate seriously needs to look into this location's poor practice:  #1 inappropriate handling of food, #2 unprofessional employees and much more.  All I can say that I wouldn't waste my time to write the review if it wasn't serious."}
{"text":"I've been to this location twice and both times, they got my order wrong. It consisted of only two toppings. I order simple pizza all the time and this is the only location thats messed up my order consistently.   The service was fast, but not accurate. I think I'll search around for other places since I'm still new to the area."}
{"text":"My pizza was almost 2 hours late.  I called their toll free number to complain and was told a regional manager would call me in 48 hours.  No one ever did.  Also, when I ordered, I gave them my credit card info and even included a tip.  They said they wouldn't charge me for the pizza but did anyway.  The pizza itself was very good.  Got the new Chicken Chipotle.  However, it's completely unacceptable to be almost 2 hours late with the pizza and then be charged for it when told you wouldn't be.  And their wings are not good at all."}
{"text":"We've tried all the Cave Creek pizza places. This is by far the fastest delivery and easiest to order online."}
{"text":"Ordered a pizza for carry out. The person at the register was commenting to the customers before me, \"Thanks for not leaving a tip\". It might just be me, but why would I tip for carry out? Made the situation a bit uncomfortable.  Should have checked it before leaving, but when the pizza was opened at home it was wrong (and tasted terrible). Called the store and the manager said he would comp for a free pizza. Called back 2 weeks later and the comped pizza was not on file. Never giving Papa John's business again."}
{"text":"Food is always good.  Had a mix up with my order pizza came and was not correct. Called and talked to the manager, Steve, who was very courteous and had the issue fixed and resent out with no hesitation. Have been a Papa johns fan for years, and guys like Steve are the reason why."}
{"text":"Upon arriving for pick up, what seemed to be a new employee was trying her best to give good customer service. Commendable. However, when Colton (we heard him being called by name for help) was asked for help on the computer, he was impatient with the new employee and didnt make even one bit of eye contact with us (customers). Never said a word to us. As important as it is to demonstrate great knowlege of the store practices, it is also imperative to deliver good customer service. We felt rushed out and were bothered by the poor treatment to the employee. Pizza is good as always. Which is why I gave more than one star."}
{"text":"This is one of the the worst Papa Johns locations I've ever experienced. I have had multiple issues and actually plan to go to the store today to speak in person with a manager.   My first experience, although living roughly .5 miles from the The Plaza location was told they couldn't deliver because my address didn't come up for them. I do live in newer construction, but it had been probably 9 months, and other places have figured it out. Being so close, I provided cross streets that had existed for years and explained exactly where my house was. Still told no. A friend had the similar initial experience and they did deliver. Inconsistent customer service I guess depending on how lazy whoever answers the phone is feeling.   Second issue, I have a kinda complicated, although not crazy, order: no cheese, extra sauce, tomatoes, banana peppers, peppers, onions, olives. Essentially a veggie pizza with some substitutions. I get that it's atypical so I make sure to confirm every time. The price should be just at $10-11 with tax for a large. On multiple occasions I've been quoted from this price up to just under $20. I then have to explain it should only be around $10-11, the untrained employee generally figures it out with a coworker and things are resolved. Still no delivery, but I'm not a big fan of the other pizza delivery option for the area, so I'll settle for carry out.   Now for my most recent experience, called The Plaza location using the number listed here on Yelp. The employee who answered did not say the location, I had no reason to question it, so I placed my order and was psyched when he told me my total would be $10.83. Yay, someone who gets it right! I don't have to do my whole explanation! I tell him my friend is already there waiting so if any way to speed it along it would be appreciated. In 15 minutes my friend goes in to pick it up. No pizza. The number listed was for another location, and the employee acknowledged to her, \"oh yea, it's wrong in Yelp.\" Lazy! The employee doesn't have to fix themselves but clearly they know this is an issue. Shouldn't the manager work to correct? I have submitted to Yelp as of this morning. Then we reorder. I tell them the exact combo again. They repeat it correctly. I hang up. They try to charge my friend $17.50. I had proactively text her what the price should be and how to explain it. The employee tells her I must have gotten some crazy deal, ummmm NO, and says for inconvenience will give her a 50% discount. As if he'd done her a favor, quotes the price as just under $10. She was too annoyed at this point to argue. She brings the pizza home and not only is the order wrong, and missing two toppings, but it is the saddest pizza I've ever seen. They gave us the tiniest amount of each topping. Please tell me this looks like a $17.50 pizza??!!   NEVER AGAIN!"}
{"text":"Great Pizza, I'm excited for Papa Johns new PAN pizza. Yummy.  I usually get pepperoni  pizza with extra pepperoni!!  There was a nice girl by the name of Jean. She was very helpful  and patient.. the place was clean!!! Good pizza pie..  UPDATE  After comparing, pan pizza from papa John's  VRS Pizza Hut.. :-) I'd have to say Pizza Hut def has the pan pizza down to perfection. Update 5-3-17  Kind Regards  CSG"}
{"text":"Middle of the afternoon delivery, and confirmation email says 30-40 min. 1 hr later, pizza is a no show so I call and speak to demitria(sp?).. who asks What do you want me to do... as if she was annoyed... looks like jets pizza it is..."}
{"text":"I love this papa johns!! It's always fast, fresh and good. Most of the time I order for delivery and I always add the tip amount to my order since I pay with card never once am I told thanks for the tip I even sometimes feel that it's expected however when I ordered today my delivery driver (whose name I didn't catch ) acknowledged the tip and politely said thank you which made me feel appreciated. Sometimes small gestures can make someone's day better which he did so for that and so much more thank you! Keep up the great service"}
{"text":"Deliveries are a hit and miss. Some days it's fast and other days, it slower than a snail taking a turd. Most of the time the well done is not well done, and the pizza is almost ambient for temp. This place is a cluster F&ck with +2 hour delivery times!"}
{"text":"This location looks like they work as a team! Very busy but employees are able to multi task. Yes there has been times when I do not like my pizza but I tell them and no questions asked, they are able to re-make it. I'll keep on coming to this location despite the negative reviews :) manager praises employees consistently! I love that!!!"}
{"text":"Wow did this place make us the best pizza tonight  My husband and I can not remember the last time we ordered pizza so good. It was on time,  hot and fresh, had the perfect amount of sauce and toppings. We ordered think crust n it was crispy and warm. I will definitely be back, ordering another pie. Thanks Papa Johns."}
{"text":"Both my pizzas were wrong the cheese sticks were burnt wings were ok not impressed with this location at all service was slow understaffed and not clean was very disappointed in food didn't hold up to a papa Johns that I would normally go to standard and the manager emailed me saying he wanted to make it right that was a joke cause when I responded he never responded back what a awful experience"}
{"text":"we have always liked Papa John's,  but, so disappointed in our delivery this evening. The driver actually said that our pizza was \"exceptionally hot\" and let me tell you....IT WAS NOT! $31 bucks for a mediocre pizza. so disappointing. will not order from Papa John's again."}
{"text":"Each time I have placed an order with 1269 college st location papa johns it has been a horrible experience.  When placing a delivery order please make sure it meets the papa johns standards and goes through quality control before the order is delivered.  Without fail the orders tend to either be missing a topping or the service is absolutely garbage.  Initially I was very excited there was papa johns now operating in Canada but I guess they decided not to bring forth the same type of customer service !  Today on May 28th 2017 was the last time I ever ordered a pizza from papa johns"}
{"text":"Easily the worst pizza location I've ordered from for any franchise. Wait staff is unprofessional, delivery is always 30 minutes or so after the promised time, and calling in is utterly worthless. The owner should fire the entire staff and find competent help."}
{"text":"Worst Papa Johns experience I've ever had. A man who looked like he was the manager made a sexist joke when I asked to split my purchase on separate cards. Him along with several other employees laughed in my face when I asked for extra sauce. It's no wonder the business was going downhill with service like this. I've never been treated this way at any type of customer service establishment."}
{"text":"This place always gets it right!  Fast delivery super nice drivers!  Other pizza delivery should take note!  Thanks Papa Johns"}
{"text":"Last night I ordered a large pizza, which was supposed to be delivered within 40-50 minutes. After an hour had gone by, I was still waiting on my pizza. I called to get a status, at which time the woman on the phone was very apologetic; she said my pizza would be delivered in 2 min. Inititially, though, she said I would have to wait for a driver. Say what? I have already waited an hour already. Anyways, when the delivery person arrived she said she would be out front of my building. NOT! I had to walk clear to the other side of an opposing building to get my pizza. In the end, the pizza we finally got was warm at best...obviously it had been sitting for quiteon some time since it rolled out of the oven. I would have rated it a 3 overall had I recieved some sort of apology from the driver. I mean, really! After all that B.S. an no apologies ...Hell to the NO! So, you get what your earned: a two!!!"}
{"text":"I ordered a pizza, garlic breadsticks, and a 2 liter of soda.  Pizza and breadsticks were done perfectly and hot upon delivery.  Soda was cold.  Delivery was on time and the driver was very polite.  I would definitely order from this location again."}
{"text":"I ordered their \"Chicken Poppers\" for $5 .. You guys... To say they tasted horrible would be a fricken understatement!!!! They were as small as pebbles. I can't believe what I received!!! I could have gotten a 10 pack of actual nuggets for less than that at McDonald's!!! SO disappointed I wasted my money!!!! I can't stress this enough, DO NOT WASTE YOUR HARD EARNED MONEY!!!"}
{"text":"They have consistently good pizza, not super spectacular, but soft and flavorful enough to satisfy any cravings. They always have promo codes that you can use to get pizza for cheap. Also, I called to order using a promo code once and then I read the fine print after I hung up, and it said I needed to order online...Whoops! It was very nice of the employees to let me use it on the phone without making a fuss at me!"}
{"text":"I rated them 1 star because The site won't allow me to select zero stars. I have never experienced such horrible customer service from a business in my life. My issue was small, I placed an online order and used a free pizza coupon for one of my pizzas but there was a glitch or something on the website and when I went to pick up my two pizzas, the free one was never made. The issue could have been solved then and there by an apology and maybe an offer to make the pizza? (I probably would have said no if they offered but offering would have been good customer service). Instead, I was told by the employee \"that's not my problem\" and \"I guess I can give you the number to our IT department or something\". I left feeling like I was at fault...not a feeling that any business should make a customer feel. I went to the website and wrote a complaint...no response. Wrote another complaint...no response. Wrote a third complaint and am supposed to hear from someone soon but I doubt that will happen. If you want to be treated poorly by the employees then I guess this is the place to go...."}
{"text":"This locations is our delivery location. They have been delivery our pizza for the past two years. I just wanted to compliment them for excellent service! We place all our orders online and they are deliver to us within 30-40 minutes. The pizza is always fresh and taste the way its supposed to taste. This is the best Papa John's location + service I've ever experience since they've been in business."}
{"text":"Worse customer service ever. I was having issues with the online ordering and after 20 minutes decided to call for my order the rep I spoke to couldn't help me so I asked for a manager to see if they could honor the coupon online and was told no. This manager was completely rude about it. It was a $3 difference and still she wasn't given the authority to honor the online special. Needless to say I ordered from pizza hut with no issues online... Don't order from here go to pizzahut online is so simple"}
{"text":"I love papa johns pizza! That being said this location is one of the worst I have ever dealt with.  My children don't like having the pepperchinis in the box and on numerous occasions the staff conveniently forgot not to put those in so they had to remake the pizzas. I ended up getting those orders for free. However, tonight there was a long, dark colored hair cooked into our pizza. Because of this error I will no longer order from this location."}
{"text":"Been eating here for the past two years. Usually order 2-3 times a month. Pizzas are very consistent"}
{"text":"Ordered 2 med pizza's today at 5:30 delivery,  didn't get till 6:35. Slow delivery.  Not even 1/4 mile away. Wouldn't pay for it."}
{"text":"So their \"policy\" changed and you can't do half a pizza with no cheese anymore.... why?  50 years ago we put men on the moon, but now we can't get an employee to put cheese on half a pizza?  We ordered an extra no cheese pizza anyway and asked for extra sauce on our wings... got no sauce on the wings, and next to no sauce on the pizzas.  Lost us as a customer."}
{"text":"Online ordering was cool and fast.   Pizza was pretty average.   Definitely more crust than topping.   Had a Works and Garden pizza on whole wheat."}
{"text":"Worst customer service! Ordered online and went to pick up after estimated ready time of 25 minutes. Came to know that order will still take atleast 25 more minutes. No apologizes or regrets but was encouraged to cancel the order!"}
{"text":"We love Papa Johns and LOVE our Southpark Colony Rd location. We just recently moved to the Grove Park neighborhood and ordered Papa Johns from this location to try out their service. Let's just say that our Large pizza looks more like Medium size pizza. There was one pizza that wasn't even cut yet and then all our pizza were original crust, but they look like thin crust pizza!   Sadly this is what is expected on this side of town and we will probably not be ordering from Papa Johns anymore unless we are picking it up on the South Side!!"}
{"text":"I liked their pizza and they hardly ever made mistakes with my order, but then they closed without warning me."}
{"text":"I want to start by saying that I get chain pizza isn't exactly gourmet... It's mass produced and missing that extra love that most mom and pop places provide.  But, chain pizza serves a purpose.  It's nearby, offers coupons, and if you're lucky it can taste good too....  So for reviewing Papa John's, please keep in mind that I'm not comparing it to a regular pizza joint.  That being said, I've had Papa Johns for years - from my old home of Pittsburgh to my new home of Las Vegas.  I always found it pretty consistent and liked the garlic sauce to dunk my crust in.  Flash forward to the last couple times I have ordered from them: really thick doughy dough (is that possible?), too much cheese, and on one really bad occasion we got canned tomatoes as a topping.  Worst of all, there's been meat lurking under the cheese like paparazzi trying to get a picture of Suri Cruise.  Ok ok, I get it.  Most people eat meat.  Eating out is a risk anyone that has dietary restrictions takes.  Ok!  Seriously, I said I get it!  Geeze.  Anyway, this has happened to us the last three times we've ordered Papa John's (this location in particular, the only one we order from).  It's always multiple pieces of meat, different varieties, and under the cheese.  So even after thorough inspection of the pie, you will bite into it.  Maybe someone doesn't like vegetarians?  Hmmmm.  I know most people won't understand, but it's seriously gross to me.  I don't think it should be that hard to keep meat off a veggie pizza.  Places like Chipotle and Zaba's do it without any problems.  Other pizza places don't have this problem.  I'll give the place two stars to try to be fair considering I used to eat Papa Johns occasionally before these shenanigans started happening.  But the quality and customer service has really gone downhill and leaves this girl with a big frowny face."}
{"text":"Pretty good pizza but very bad customer service. Rude person answering the phone. I don't think management is any good there. If I owned this place I would want someone to let me know that my main guy answering phone was super rude."}
{"text":"They were busy and I have problems with my legs. They weren't able to show the gracious ability to make sure that I was happy with the experience. So my advice is not to go there unless you are totally healthy. Besides that. .the food certainly wasn't that great. No more for me . I'll go back to the great service and good quality of our favorite pizza place"}
{"text":"I ordered a pizza online for delivery. Before the pizza made it to my house I had a water leak and fell.I  was unable to get up from the floor and answer the door. They called twice to check on me but I couldn't get the phone(I was on the floor). Once I managed to get up I called to let them know what happened and that I was not flaking on them. The manager was very kind and offered to remake the order. I had to decline since I had a mess to clean up. The next day they stopped by the house to check on me and brought me a beautiful card and flowers!  They are outstanding! I have never had a problem with my order or the quality of the food.The drivers are always wonderful(as well as management when I have had to speak with them). This is the BEST customer Care I have ever received! I encourage everyone to order from these location next time you are hungry!   Thanks Papa Johns(on Power and McDowell)"}
{"text":"The pizzas have always came out ok. But any orders for their bread of any kind, brown as hell. It's too burnt for my liking. Never ordering them again."}
{"text":"New to the area so I decided to try a big chain restaurant instead of experimenting with one of the smaller pizza shops. I waited an hour and a half and then the delivery driver was extremely rude after asking for the store managers information. Will never order here again and would definitely not recommend."}
{"text":"Two horrible delivery experiences. The first, ordered online and received an email advising a delivery time of 30-40 minutes, 2 hours later I demanded a refund instead the advised additional 30 minutes to recieve my order.  Tonight I placed an online order and via email advised to allow 30-40 minutes. One hour later I called the store and was advised the driver came to my address, called me and after not getting an answer returned to the store. I sat by the door all evening and did not hear a car, no one ever knocked or rung the door bell. The store offered to make my order then deliver it after waiting over an hour after the original online order."}
{"text":"The cheeseburger pizza was good.  I'm not a fan of pickles and the pizza is pickle overkill.  Chicken bites for $6.99 sucked and you're better off ordering a small pizza for that price!  Pizza was hot and came out quickly.  Service was ok.  Other than the girl who \"was off\" For the night-  she was yelling at everyone in the back while she waited for her pizza.  Very unprofessional.  I've never worked at a pizza place so I'm not sure if this is the typical work environment.  Or maybe it was her daisy dukes and horrible muffin top staring at me and my daughter as we waited.  ;) gross.  I mentioned this because my little girl said something about it."}
{"text":"First experience ordering from this location and was fairly  satisfied! Ordered the new XLarge pizza, the 9 count brownie box and a mountain dew. Only issue was one of my toppings were missing (pepperoni) and the girl taking my order didn't seem at all enthused to take my order. Other than that, I would consider ordering from this location again."}
{"text":"Usually I stick to a very regimen diet. Today is my birthday so I decided to eat something I haven't had in years- papa johns pizza.   I ordered a medium pizza 1/2 veggie 1/2 cheese with extra marinara throughout. The cheese side being for me and the veggie for my husband.  Upon pickup I come to find out that it is fully veggie with barely any marinara sauce throughout.   What a bummer."}
{"text":"There online services is Gd. That's where the best deals are at. Love there garlic knots there amazing. Chicken could be better. They should go with battered dip wings instead of bake. Certain pizza they make is gd. I would take pizza hut supreme and meat lover's over papa John's any day of the week. I would take happy pizza spicy Italian over papa John's any day of the week."}
{"text":"I ordered a simple large 3 topping pizza at 10:20pm, it is now 12:32am and the pizza is still in the store.  I called an hour after placing the order and they told me that the driver was out and would be back in 30 mins. An HOUR later I called to check the status and the driver isn't even back yet!! I do not know who manages this location but something needs to change.  It has been two full hours and it hasn't even left the store!    Their response to all of this, they can give me a coupon code for a free pizza tomorrow... by the rate things are going now my original order might not arrive until then."}
{"text":"Crust was doughy and where were the toppings??  Will never it Papa John's again.  YUCK!!!!"}
{"text":"Papa John's West Springfield Employee: \"Papa Johns\" Me: \"Hi! Is the email for 50% off I received good for carry out?\" Employee: \"No! Online only!\" Click  So after I got hung up on, I proceeded to call Jett's almost across the street from them and place a $50.00 order. Too much competition to ACCEPT RUDE CUSTOMER SERVICE."}
{"text":"Great service!  Called for delivery, was assisted by Diane who was awesome. Ordered almost everything on the menu, modified it all and Diane was totally on it. She confirmed my order and when she gave the total it was almost $20 off  what I had expected. I was shocked!!!!!.I asked if that wad the correct price and she said yes! Diane worked my crazy order integrated with the specials  to give me a great deal.I was very impressed. She went above and beyond my expectations and saved me  about $20. My driver arrived prompt and had everything ready for me. Very pleased with the service. And after a long day on the lake with sun burn and too many beers,  this may have been the best Papa John pizza we've ever eaten!  Side note:I belive in karma and paying it forward. Since Diane gave me a $20 discount I gave the driver that $20 as his tip. To see the smile on his face made my day. I challenge YOU ( whoever reads this) to pay it forward. Let's put a few more smiles in AZ!"}
{"text":"I rolled my eyes a little when my brother told me that he wanted to order a pizza from Papa John's, because I'm biased against pizza that comes out of a chain big enough to have television commercials.  I was so indifferent that I let him order whatever he wanted without my input, and wasn't even sure that I would eat any of it.  But when I did, I was pleasantly surprised.  He ordered the Tuscan Six Cheese, his favorite, and it was a very enjoyable pizza.  Nothing incredible, but it tasted good, wasn't too thick or thin, and wasn't any greasier than I would expect of a pizza made by a chain pizza shop (read: it was a little greasy).  For what we were getting, it seemed a little overpriced, but for easy takeout, it worked."}
{"text":"This is the worst experience I have ever had with a Papa Johns. The manager, Jeray(sp?) was extremely rude. I placed an order and after waiting over an hour I called to inquire about my pizza. They said they gave it to whoever was in the parking lot- not me. They then said they would send another out, which after another 25 mins I called and they said they just put the pizza in the oven. I began to tell the manager that is not how business is done and it is poor customer service, with him interjecting the whole time to cut me off and then hung up on me. I called back to get the store manager's info and he hung up on me again! Would rather eat any other pizza than deal with them again! So long, Ex-Loyal Papa Johns patron"}
{"text":"What a disappointment....  I have loved Papa John's pizza for years and always made them my \"go to\" pizza place. When I moved to this side of town I was ecstatic to find out that there was a location within a couple of miles from me. Unfortunately, the last few experiences I've had have been less than pleasant and after this last I will not be ordering from Papa John's again.  The reason I am displeased with their service is due to my last three deliveries from them....yes....THREE times my delivery has been incorrect.  The first time my pizza was delivered with the wrong toppings. I had ordered bacon and instead received sausage. That night I had people over, however, so trying to get a replacement just wasn't worth the hassle. The last two times I ordered delivery I asked for Chicago cut (cut into squares instead of traditional) and both times were not cut as such. Now, this seems like a very small thing to be upset over but at the end of the day, it is something I ordered and didn't get it as such. After the second time of it happening I called them about it and was told I'd be compensated with a free pizza coupon but have yet to see anything arrive.  Being someone that works in customer service, I hate when customers only write reviews or offer feedback when it's only a result of bad customer service (I always fill out surveys and offer positive feedback when I have a great experience somewhere) but unfortunately this Papa John's location has not made me feel like a valued customer and this is one of those times that my feedback is coming off a negative experience."}
{"text":"I would give u a 0 if I could.  They made a mistake on my order last night.  Instead of getting my usual pizza they gave me a plain cheese pizza.  I called them back last night and the guy said that they were closed but call back tomorrow and they will fix it.  When I got off work I called back and wow.  The lady put me on hold for 5 mins without even saying hi.  When she answered I told her what happened and she said oh ok please hold.  By this point it was 15 mins later and she answered welcome to papa johns pizza how can I help u.  And I said I've been on hold for 15 mins.  She said oh so sorry we r busy and I explained to her again.  She said ok one moment and she left without putting me on hold.  I listened to the girls talking and laughing for 10 mins in the background.  Then the phone rang and I was automatically on hold again!!!  When she came back she said welcome to papa johns how can I help u and I was like are u for real right now????  Around 28 mins into the call I got on the phone with the manager and I told him everything and that the guy said to just call back and it would be good.  He's like there is no note and no credits given.  I couldn't believe him at all.  And then I told him so r u telling me u r not going to fix the mistake u made?  And he started giving me attitude.  Wow this was the worst experience I have EVER had in my life and I took a screen shot of the 32 minute phone call.  Corporate will definitely be hearing about this.  Disgusting."}
{"text":"I love Papa Johns but this location is just pathetic.   Even carryout is laughable,  employees everywhere while I just stand at the register ignored.  New management is needed here."}
{"text":"Tried to order online. Had a special of 2 med pizzas for $7.77 each. Website wasn't working so called in. Asked for same special given site wasn't working. They refused. Stated something about different systems as if there was nobody there that could adjust the price of a pizza. Bad business. There are lots of pizza options. Choose a place that actually values your patronage."}
{"text":"Do not buy from this Papa Johns.  I ordered 4 large pizzas and 24 wings for my son's birthday party.  The food showed up on time, but the wings were not cooked.  They were squishy and soft.  The 12 year old boys would not even touch them.  We ended up throwing away the wings.  The pizza was normal quality.  I decided to call the store and let them know about the issue.  I waited on the phone for over 20 minutes before I was able to talk to someone (Don't believe me? Check my profile pic).  He admitted that sometimes that happens with the wings.  If you know it happens, why are you not checking the wings before you send them out?  He said he could send out another set of wings, but that would have arrived well after the party was over and would not have accomplished anything.  I asked him for a refund of the money I paid for the wings and he said the system could not do that.  He said there was nothing he could do for me.  I will never buy from Papa Johns again"}

{"text":"Wrong food, took almost an hour to get the wrong food. Called and told them, unapologetic. Calling driver to find our order. Bad night at papas"}
{"text":"I really should have read the reviews before ordering from here.  It took almost an hour to have our pizza delivered.  I specifically ordered it \"well done\" and it arrived barely warm and soggy.  Such a disappointment."}
{"text":"I'm not particularly fond of most chain pizza places, especially Papa John's in particular. Domino's is usually my choice, in a pinch. However, I was somehow talked into ordering Papa John's, lol. It actually ended up not being that bad though.   One of the things that made it so much better, is the fact that Daniel, the guy that took my order, hooked it up for me. I won't really go into details though, as to protect the innocent. But, I will say this; he definitely knows the definition of customer appreciation, even given the fact that I wasn't a regular customer to begin with. Daniel knows how to gain customer loyalty though. And, for this reason, I will definitely come back to this location, whenever I want a quick pizza fix, that is.  The pizza was done in 10 minutes, as promised. Thanks Daniel! And for that my friend, you have earned an extra 1/2 star for this review, on top of the 3rd star that you already got initially ;) So, if you want it done right, ask for Daniel."}
{"text":"Veg pizza was really good. After very long time am having such a good pizza from papa johns"}
{"text":"Bought a pizza, choked down one slice,threw the rest of it in the garbage and the garbage threw it back.  Never in 50 years of eating pizza in New York, Chicago, and cities throughout Italy have I had pizza crust that had been sweetened with sugar or some other sweetener. Couldn't find the cheese, no tomato sauce, 4 pepperoni slices and very few mushrooms. Terrible excuse for a pizza."}
{"text":"We ordered an online special for 2 large pizzas. We were disappointed that you had to use internet to get deal as when we called store directly they would not honor deal. The store charges 2.49 delivery charge that is not considered a tip for the driver. The pizza arrived as expected and tasted great. Ordering process is about 3/5. Food was 4/5"}
{"text":"This place sucks! I ordered and asked for extra pepperoncinis pepper and the lady said to me the green ones, and i'm like yes. And the pizza comes and its fucking green peppers. I call them back and the stupid bitch lady argues with me and tells me to hold and I do and she hangs up. Just go order somewhere else, this place is so not worth it."}
{"text":"If I could give 0 stars, I would. I set an order for 11:15 delivery and couldnt find the delivery person. They did not deliver my food, charged my boyfriends card twice, and said we can comp you.  Comp me for what? I had no food at work today and the delivery guy wasn't smart enough to leave it with security and text me if he couldn't find me. He took it back to the store.So no food AND charged twice Thanks guys for nothing."}
{"text":"It's been a long time since I ordered Papa Johns, now I remember why. The pizza was bland and not that hot. However, the real problem was the service. I made a mistake and double ordered some bread, good thing it was far superior in taste to the pizza. I also ordered and paid for 10 pizza sauce side dippers and receive NONE. I also asked for 10 parmigian packets and received NONE. looks like I'll stick with the other Papa!"}
{"text":"Called made an order.  Was told it would be 35 to 45 minutes.  After an hour I called and the rude young man who answered was very unhelpful!  Told me it would be 90 minutes before the pizza would be delivered.  After telling me it was going to be 90 minutes I asked if he would be able to tell me an approximate time for the delivery he said \"I could if I put you on hold, looked up the number for the driver, and tried contacting the driver I would be able to tell you\"!!!! Very poor customer service!!!!! Will never order again from this location!"}
{"text":"Pizza was supposed to be here in 45 minutes, but arrived in 30.  Speedy for sure, but the driver didnt have enough change for 2 20's."}
{"text":"I love ordering pizza from this Papa John's location. Their customer service is top notch! We always get our order in a decent amount of time, and the pizza/breadsticks are delicious and just as ordered.  Plus, who doesn't love that butter/garlic dipping sauce that comes with their pizza?!...Very unhealthy, but oh so good. :)"}
{"text":"I would give them 0 if possible. Terrible and rude order taker at 10 pm on Sunday night. Tried to order over the phone and out of nowhere puts me on infinite hold without even warning. After 15 min I hang up the phone and they will bever earn my business. In fact I will wrote the corporate office about this. Avoid this location."}
{"text":"First off this is the second time coming here.. Disappointed by the chaos and disorganization that caused a long wait after going to the place to pick up the pizza 30 mins after I called and ordered. It took another 15 mins before finally getting my pizza. This happened both times i went there. Really?!? It should not be like this. This will be the last time I come here. The pizza was good but if it takes all this to get a pizza."}
{"text":"Not a bad papa john's and is super hard to beat the value and have specials all the time.  I regularly get  2 2-topping pizzas for under $15"}
{"text":"While there pizza is good and the location is right down the street I will no longer be going to this Papa John's. On Saturday night at around 9:15 I placed an order online. My girlfriend and I arrived there about 20 minutes after I ordered and we signed for it and were told that it was just being cut and have a seat. About 10 minutes after that we heard some of the employees saying that some of these pizzas got messed up and that they can't find them. Another employee said something like our pizza was already gone. I then spoke up and said no we are sitting right here, all he said was OK. 15 minutes after that and being completely ignored by the 6 or so workers we were handed our pizza and the guy said he threw in an extra garlic sauce for our trouble. Needless to say I was angry, not with the fact that they messed up but the staff did nothing to correct it. The girl at the front said nothing, the additional staff did not either and the least they could do was give us a coupon or throw in some bread sticks, just some token to show that they cared about their mistake. But no, so I will no longer be giving them my business and I encourage you to do the same."}
{"text":"Horrible experience!!!!! Very poor customer service. Ordered a pizza online. Due to a glitch my order went through twice, which I was unaware of. Once I got to the store the cashier had no problem rudely letting me know that my order went through twice and telling me that I should  have called in to cancel one of my orders. How would I know to do that if I did not know that the order went through twice???? After explaining to her that it was a mistake and apologizing for the mix up, I was verbally assaulted. Once my order was complete, my pizza was slung across the counter at me. When I asked to speak to a manager, she refused. I then told her that her customer service was horrible and proceeded to leave when the young lady proceeded to approach me in an aggressive manner as if she wanted to fight me. So much so her coworkers stopped what they were doing to pull her back. Seriously???!!!!! Is this really how customers are treated???? The level of disrespect and unprofessionalism is off the charts. This location should not be patronized until this matter is taken care of. This is unacceptable and I hope not who Papa Johns feels is best suited to represent their brand."}
{"text":"I refuse to use this location anymore. The manager was mean, the district manger didn't care, and we've given them multiple chances over the last 3 years to have our pizza to us faster than Pizza Hut-it ALWAYS takes over an hour and we live 5 min down the street."}
{"text":"My wife and I live right behind this location, so we always order online then just walk over and get our food.  We absolutely enjoy the \"John's Favorite\" pizza, the seasoning they use on this is to die for! So if you're having a hard time trying to figure out what to order...GET THIS!   The one thing I have noticed is the staff isn't always the best at greeting the customers. Now I do understand things get busy and maybe overwhelming, but a simple hello, just to acknowledge that you are happy that your customers are there, definitely goes a long way. So that's really the only reason I am giving them 4 stars instead of 5.   I'm not saying the staff is rude or mean or anything like that, I personally, would just like a \"hello!\" when we walk in.  But overall great place! Get the \"John's Favorite\"!"}
{"text":"We order pizza and had it delivered. When it got here it was tossed and ripped. Like if some one had dropped my pizza before it got here. Called Manager Eli and spoke to him about my delivery. Not very kind. Didn't seem to care."}
{"text":"We order here often and the pizza is always good. They have a habit of forgetting the siftdrinks we order though so only 3 stars."}
{"text":"Alright the food was good. As good as chain pizza can be, but there is an issue. The deal today was you could get a extra large with three toppings. I put pepperoni three times. I wanted this pizza to look like a pepperoni massacre. I wanted it to look like it was entirely made out of pepperoni. What I got was a pizza with what one could call one serving of pepperoni, but honestly it was even lacking on that. We could have done great things together, papa johns. I wanted to open that box and hear vegans everywhere scream out in pain. I wanted there to be so much meat that I truly felt bad about eating it. Weak effort. Increase your plans for pepperoni world domination and give me a call. Since my disappointment with starting a pepperoni world war, I have ordered from this place twice and have gotten my pizza very quickly (reminds me of the days when pizza was guaranteed in 30 minutes). My orders have been completed as ordered. I have however, not tried to get them to dump a 4x4 truck bed of pepperoni on my pizza again. We haven't established that much trust to try that again, papa johns."}
{"text":"What a waste of time and money to order a pizza and they take their sweet time, I had to call twice then they proceded to tell me that my pizza got out of the oven at 7:34 and I live 10 minutes from location. Now it's 8:20 and they have just got here"}
{"text":"As far as fast food pizza goes, Papa John's may be one of my favorites. The crust is seasoned very well and is delicious, and the garlic sauce that every pizza comes with is delicious to dip in. The pizza is a nice depth as well and the toppings are yummy."}
{"text":"I love this Papa John's! I order online all the time and they get my order correct and get it out in a timely fashion. Even on a busy busy Friday night it takes no more than an hour to reach me :). The delivery drivers are always so nice too! Plus the pizza is yummy!!"}
{"text":"My experiences with papa johns have always been good until I came to this particular store. The pizza itself was good, but the trouble I had getting it makes me not want to go back. They barely spoke English so it took them forever to get my order correct and to add on I had to wait about 20 minutes for my pizza. I was the ONLY one in the store. Not to mention when I finally got the pizza it wasn't hot. It was sorta warm but they could have done much better."}
{"text":"If you like to be on hold and have to park around all of the delivery drivers and their pals when you pick up then wait some more, it's all good"}
{"text":"I have always had a good experience at this papa johns. Sorry to see such low stars for them.  I have been going there for a year. They are a very busy location any have soooo many workers in a tiny store. I think they handle it well considering those factors. They make my complicated order right every time. All the employees are nice. I don't do delivery only pick up. Good job guys!!!"}
{"text":"This is our preferred pizza delivery place. It's really easy to order online and it is always delivered in a reasonable amount of time. The best thing is the pizza is handled with care and arrives looking good and appetizing, which it is cause it tastes so good."}
{"text":"I really like this papa johns! They are so quick with delivery, it is great! And the pizza is always good! One time we had pizza delivered and they forgot to cut it so I called back and asked if we could bring it in to be cut, but instead they brought us a new one completely free and cut our old one!!! Great customer service!!!"}
{"text":"I orderd a pizza over the phone and when i came in to pick it up they acted like i never called it in. If i wanted to be stared at by goon telling me lies i would go to a Bernie Sanders rally. my interaction with this papa johns was worse than if you got sexuallly harassed by that creepy P.E. coach that everybody had in middle school. It can't be hard to take the order i called and put it in the system. i hope the employees learn to stop holding the phone upside down, or maybe how to use a pen and some paper. never going to papa johns again.   ps Papa Murphys is better"}
{"text":"We ordered pizza today for lunch in our dental office.  The doctor was eating and a piece of glass was in the pizza.  They offered to return the money never did.  I don't recommend going to this store."}
{"text":"Would be better if management didn't stink so bad! I used to love papa johns until I realized what a great person he was I wont support a franchise that treats employees to poorly!"}
{"text":"Rant for the evening: I just spent an INCREDIBLY long amount of time on the phone trying to order a pizza from Papa Johns, because their website was not responding.  When you can't understand \"I want to order one pizza,\" and it takes several minutes and you still aren't getting it, I don't want to pay you very much in the way of money.  I literally could not stay on the phone any longer to try to convey the idea that I wanted one pizza.  Please train your employees so they know how to use the computerized ordering system.  the person I spoke to was hopelessly lost, and now I'm going to another place with my business."}
{"text":"I don't know what management is like here yet, but the delivery woman was awful.  She argued with my husband over the phone accusing him of not knowing his own address.   She went to the wrong street and told him pretty much that SHE was right and he did not know what he was talking about.  By the time we got our pizza it was cold and rubbery. Had it not been for the late delivery, I'm sure it would have been great."}
{"text":"Called a pizza order in and went to pick it up and they didn't even put the order in.  Had to wait  with no apologies, discount , or coupon.  The pizza is just OK.."}
{"text":"Worst service ever. Took more than an hour for ONE pizza. How. I even called the store nicely just to ask what's up and all they could tell me was that it was out for delivery. Garbage. And usually I love papa johns"}
{"text":"My family and I have ordered hundreds of pizzas from this papa johns location as the years go either for parties or dinner/lunch.  Their management and employees are what makes this location one of the best in the area; very polite and willing to work with the customer, I always feel comfortable ordering here.  I'm the one customer that is very picky on making the pie's I order well-done. They do it when I ask, and the pie is delicious every time. Perfect crust.  The coupons, such as the 40% and 50% off ones are amazing; always available it seems like which is perfect. I love the rewards program they offer and I've gotten several pizzas for free through that program, I recommend signing up for that if you are a consistent customer like how I am!  I usually pickup my pie's at the location but sometimes I chose delivery when I cannot commute. The delivery is very fast and the pie's are PIPING hot and fresh when they arrive. The delivery drivers are friendly as well.  When I do not commute to my favorite Italian pizzerias, which are miles away from my house, I will always order at this papa johns.   I recommend this location...!"}
{"text":"This place is a joke.  I ordered a pizza for delivery and was told 30 minutes. I called after an hour and was told it was in the oven. I decided to go pick it up.  When I arrived, I discovered it had been picked up by a delivery driver and in route to the wrong house. The manager is a complete moron. I will never go back."}
{"text":"Ordered the new Double Layered Premium Pepperoni Pizza.  Picked it up and they were out of the premium pepperoni.  The manager didnt even tell me. They didnt say a word till I went back in, because all I had was a pepperoni pizza.  No sorry or warning or anything.  Pizza was really bad as well.  This place has been going down hill for at least a year.  I finally learned my lesson."}
{"text":"Had an issue with an order called to speak with a manager. The first guy I spoke with was very nice. Then the manager I spoke with was rude and lied. Will be steering clear of this place in the future."}
{"text":"It's rare for me to write a positive review for a company, but Papa Johns went above the call of duty today so I thought I should leave this review! I ordered Papa Johns online and about 10min later I arrived to pick it up as it was a carryout order. While I was paying, I asked how long it would take to get the pizza and their response was 8 minutes. Well it took 20 minutes for the pizza to get to me but due to the slowness for them to get me my pizza they gave me free pizza coupons! They went above and beyond and I am glad I gave Papa Johns my business!"}
{"text":"An impromptu party sprung up in the Dance Studio last night at 10:30 and nothing was open for food, oh what to do? We called Papa John's on Via Linda and ordered two large pizzas. They were delivered very quickly and by a very nice guy - he even laughed at our jokes (always good for a tip). And two large pizzas for less than $24, who can beat that? One regular crust with tomato, pepperoni and olives and one thin crust with ?? (not mine so who cares, haha) were both very good.  We added a little wine, a little beer, music, and good friends and it was a party! I love Papa John's at home and now found a great place to order late night in Scottsdale too!"}
{"text":"The worst Papa Johns ever. People are rude, even the manager! If I could, I'd give them a -1 star. One should inform people whom order from them that the don't deliver in certain locations; rather then taking card information. And have them cancel their order and start the process over again at another location."}
{"text":"New to the area and had a papa johns in so-cal I loved.  This place is decent if you want chain pizza at a good price."}
{"text":"Although the driver was very kind... Charging me the same price when you don't have a topping? Saying you called the number listed with no response and I have no missed calls... Negative one for lying and an additional negative for not having my topping and or replacing it with something else. This really ruined my day before work and I've NEVER yelped before but this place deserved it."}
{"text":"You really have to make an effort to find worse pizza.  Mediocre meats and veggies are placed under the cheese, making for a soggy, unappetizing pie.  I don't eat fast-food pizza often, but I have tried all the chains, and Papa John's is the worst of the bad.  Do yourself a favor and find a locally-owned restaurant that doesn't aspire to be the Wal-Mart of pizzerias. You'll find plenty on Yelp."}
{"text":"I Work down town and every time I order pizza at this location it is fresh and delicious! Sometimes a few minutes late give or take a few but never had any major issues and the staff is extremely nice and always willing to go the extra mile. The best pizza around town!"}
{"text":"I honestly wish this review was about the pizza. However, after being on hold for 20 minutes I decided to call a different local pizza spot. If I was mr popa, I would be disappointed at the loss of money from customers just trying to place an order and going some place else. #pizzafail"}

{"text":"Why the hell was there bits of pineapple in our non-pineapple having pizza?  That was weird.  Also, the people who work there seem kind of shady.  The girl at the counter was covered in flour.  It was on her face, her arms, her hair, all over her clothes...it was weird. Not sure I'd use this location again."}
{"text":"Worst. Service. Ever.  Frequently send out incomplete orders (heads up, especially if you order extra/different sauces).  Super slow delivery.  Inconsistent quality of the pizza.  Final straw tonight when the delivery guy called me from almost literally around the corner from my house telling me he could not find my address.  I gave him my development name and the name of the street he was looking to turn on to.  It took him 30 minutes from that time (which was already 45+ minutes after I placed my order) to find his way here.  Pizza was cold.  Missing the extra sauce I ordered and paid for.  So I sent him back to fill the order and bring back an acceptable quality product.  Turns out, he told them I outright refused the order and did not want the pizza.  Over 2 hours after I placed my order and I now have no dinner.  And I have to be up in about 5 and 1/2 hours for work.  Looks like I'll be going to bed hungry.  I've put up with the mediocre service because they're pretty much the only delivery game in town.  Forget it.  Never again.  Wasting the gas to pick up a decent pizza elsewhere is a small price to pay to actually eat."}
{"text":"I have never tried papa John's there pizza is so delicious and you always get coupons in your email, delivery took 25 minutes."}
{"text":"DO NOT order Pizza from this location !  After working a 12 hour day, I began by looking up their menu on the corporate website. I selected the small pie which they advertised at $7.99. I decided to add one topping, and called the Desert Inn location.   A young woman answered the phone, and mumbled into the phone for about 30 seconds, then put me on hold.  After about a 5 minute wait, she tried to take my order, forgetting each item several times as we proceeded. (Maybe she is on drugs?)  She then told me my total was almost $19!   When I asked her the difference in pricing VS the web, she told me to just order there.  I did go ahead and do an internet order, very easy to use menu, and my receipt told me 15 minutes. I arrived 35 minutes later, they did not have it ready.   If you want rude and incompetent service, by all means order from this store"}
{"text":"I was extremely dissapointed with my order yesterday. It appears Papa Johns was running low on product. My pizza's were really light with the toppings and forget about the extra topping I paid to have added. I guess when it's busy quality of product no longer applies.  Having spent almost $40 on my order, I think it's time to try a another pizza company.........."}
{"text":"For a papa johns restaurant it's exactly what it's suppose to be. It's quick, good customer service, and accurate. Prices are more than dominos, but that's not this particular stores fault."}
{"text":"What is up with your cheese?  It has a texture of curdled milk and the sauce tastes like tomato soup.  Don't know if you guys changed your product or what but never again."}
{"text":"Have always wanted to try their pizza,  was not disappointed.   Just the right amount of sauce and cheese, also cooked to just the right darkness."}
{"text":"This place has the greatest employees! Usually clean and neat, and above all the most respectful that I've seen yet. The food is always great (who doesn't like good pizza).  As far as things on the drivers vehicles... really!? You are ordering a pizza not the delivery man! I'd give Papa John's six stars if it were an option!"}
{"text":"Poor staff and management. There have been several occasions where this particular location has completely forgotten about my order. The approximate wait time given is always 30-40 minutes, yet the pizza doesn't leave the location until I call and ask about it, usually an hour later. When the pizza arrives, it is cold.    If you like Papa John's, pick a different location."}
{"text":"There was a silght mix-up at this store.  Jake, the manager, handled it like a true professional.  Wonderful customer service.  Delicious product as well."}
{"text":"Call this pizza for getting yourself the best insult in the city. Order the pizza they will promise delivery in 30 minutes, call to verify your order they will say it takes 1.5 hrs to reach for the delivery, and you would be asked to cancel if you want to know the status. Have respect and eat with some sense in this great city."}
{"text":"One of the tw best pizza's i've had in this area.   Friendly fresh and made exactly like I ordered it on-line......You owe yourself to try it.......don't pay more for less!!!"}
{"text":"Papa Johns is one of the better pizza chains out there. The Hudson location is located in Acme Plaza. The pizza here is very good, although it is not the best in Hudson. The last time I had pizza from here (there is no dining in; it's all takeout and delivery), I had the spinach alfredo pizza. At first, you wouldn't think that alfredo sauce would work on pizza. However, Papa Johns pulls it off very well. It is very rich, but full of flavor. I really enjoyed it. Overall, if you are looking for pizza in Hudson, consider Papa Johns. You won't regret it."}
{"text":"This is one of the poorer quality Papa Johns in the area, but is the closest. Womp womp.  They tend to skimp on a lot of things, don't always get garlic butter with each pizza or the peppers.  Once ordered extra cheese and you could see more red sauce than you could cheese.  My suggestion is to always check your pizzas before you leave, unlike all other Papa Johns stores, this one doesn't voluntarily show them to you to be sure they are quality and correct."}
{"text":"This is the worst store ever I have ever dealed with. I checked with them if they deliver and they said yes. Their guy passed my home and said he cannot make up to the hill while he does not. My home is not up on the hill. Just come back. I called him and asked him to stop there and I will go out to meet him. He agreed on the phone but when I went out. He was gone!! I called their store and was hoping they can tell that guy to wait for me but do not carry my kids pizza and run away. The store manager's attitude was horrible. I will never order pizza from this store nor any people I know!"}
{"text":"Ok so today was the first time we tried papa johns on Thomas road...231 w Thomas road specifically. ..the person who answered our call was very disinterested to say the least but we pressed on...she took ALL our details down...address phone number, debit card...our order totaled $30 something plus we tip well for good service.  We ordered pizza and wings because my grandsons were spending time with us and when we asked what pizza they wanted they said papa johns without hesitation.  So...we thought we would try it.  They said thirty minutes and that was at approximately 6.30 pm...by 7.35pm nothing had arrived.  I was so angry because my boys were starving...so we called..the idiot who answered said to my husband \"We have been calling you,  \"bro\"!  How unprofessional to refer to a customer as \"bro\"!  Needless to say, we had no missed calls on our phone.  The Manager did not even try to make it right and said that they had the wrong address and that we would have our money refunded in 24 hours!   Unbelievable!  So they had the wrong address, wrong phone number but not the wrong credit card number because we still have a pending transaction!!!!! NEVER EVER AGAIN...it was so difficult for me to give even 1 star to this place.  What disgusting customer service!  My grandson said he was sorry he ever told us about papa johns...he's 10 years old!!!  You guys just lost not only us but all our family and friends...Great job \"Bro\"!!!!!!"}
{"text":"This place is terrible. Bad management. The guy who answered the phone sounded drunk or just doesn't even car enough to enunciate his words. Honestly would never ever order from this place again."}
{"text":"The pizza is excellent everytime. Cost a little more than competitors but worth it. The wait is not too long. Overall good experience. Will come back."}
{"text":"Skimpy on toppings.  You can design your own pizza and customize it but it is a waste of time. Ordered extra cheese, extra sauce and 2x the sausage but wasn't there.  Crust was undercooked.  don't waste your money, order Pizza Hut."}
{"text":"I always order online which is so easy on convenient.  My order is alway ready when I get there.  My order is always fresh and accurate.  The taste is much better than the competitors."}
{"text":"The service here has gotten better and offers really good deals so I re-rate it 4 stars."}
{"text":"My experiences with this location is their service is usually really slow. Although, the pizza is always good, and they usually have some good deals."}
{"text":"Our pizza was totally raw!  Completely disgusting and totally un-edible.  I would give 0 stars if I could."}
{"text":"OK so the pizza was good THIS time however it wasn't cut!! REALLY Papa John I have to cut my OWN pizza ? Prior to this order I've had problems like I requested square cut and get traditional cut, or I order thin crust and get original  ...I'm not the type of person to call and complain so I just deal with it. I'm hoping this review will be helpful so that going forward If I decide to order again it will be Correct Hot and CUT! ."}
{"text":"We frequented this location for about 5 years and were always happy with the quality of pizzas that we got. We stopped going because $15-17 is a lot to spend on a take-out pizza. I can get a Streets of New York pizza across the street for that price, and it's better tasting.  We usually get Costco or Little Caesars for take-out."}
{"text":"Ordered a pizza and wings, a few hours after I ate my stomach was churning and in pain. Long story short the toilet was my best friend for a couple hours. Thanks papa johns"}
{"text":"Always have an excellent experience when I come here great pizza for a good price the ease of ordering online make it that much better"}
{"text":"Was going to order from here until the customer service was horrible. Asked the kid about delivering to our location which is literally five minutes away. He said they do not deliver to our hotel since we are across the i10 highway. Said to call the other dysart and van buren location which is 15 minutes away. Doesn't make sense but policy is there way i have no problem with that. But blatant shit customer service will not make you guys money ever. I didn't catch his name regardless its a poor way to handle someone willing to spend their money on this place."}
{"text":"Our entire group was waiting on a pizza delivery, which we had already paid for. The delivery guy, Eric, called us to tell us he had arrived but after the 60 seconds it had taken us to arrive at the lobby of the building, he had already left? \"We have a 5 minute rule,\" we were told later on the phone by another extremely rude representative."}
{"text":"We have been going here for a very long time (probably close to 15 years). It is our go-to pizza spot. Pizza is always fresh, always tasty, and service is always friendly. No complaints!"}
{"text":"Last Night I had the Half Pepperoni/Mushroom and Half Hawaiian Pizza...It was Delicious as usual!!! From this Location the Food Is ALWAYS Perfect, On Time and The Staff has Always Been Vry Friendly!!"}
{"text":"Ordered online today Monday,October 23, 2017 at 7:20pm it said my delivery time was between 9:33pm - 9:43pm the system said it was being made when I tried to log back in to see where it was I was having problem so I phoned the Freedom Dr locstion to ask the status of my pizza. I was told I had a 3 hour delivery at that point and my pizza had not been put in the oven yet. It was 9:35pm at that point and I placed this order at 7:20pm on a Monday night. I cancelled my order I had already waited over 2 hours."}
{"text":"I love Papa Johns Pizza but seems to always have trouble with this one. I ordered online at 10:00 pm recieved my order confirmation by email at 10:05 saying 40 to 50 min for delivery. Its really not far.. maybe 5 min away. At 11:10 I called to check on my pizza. No apologies  just told it would be there any time. I asked when that would be. She gave a snarky answer and said no more than 15 or 20 min!!!  I finally received my pizza at 11:20. Twice as long as the estimated.  On top of that my pizza was wrong."}
{"text":"ordered pizza last sunday for the games. went in for carryout. pizza here papa johns kind of sucks.. not tasty at all. not HOT papas has gone down hill, i used to love the pizza, nope nit any more."}
{"text":"Last time I ordered delivery it was almost an hour late. Today I was told it would be here by 11:27am and it's now 11:45am. When I finally reached the store I was told mine is the next to go out. So 15 min after my order is supposed to be here and it hasn't even been sent out yet? Over it. I can get better quality and faster service from the locally owned place down the block."}
{"text":"Poor customer service, nothing but pimple faced teenage boys working there! Twice they have gotten my order wrong; the first time I called back to complain and they promised a coupon in the mail... never received it. The second time I didn't bother calling back. Switching to a new pizza joint! Plus super expensive!"}
{"text":"THE best pizza!!!  Thank you so much for coming to Canada and Mississauga. Excellent taste and ingredients and great value.  We won't order from anyone else again."}
{"text":"RECONSIDER YOUR DECISION to buy here.....I have regularly ordered pizza for my family from this location. The last two times they delivered the wrong pizza, in fact it was the wrong family name, and my babysitter did not do anything about it, so it just sat there and my 3 yr old went to bed hungry. When I got home and learned of it I called the store and it took 3 days before I could reach a Manager, who would not call me back, and eventually a letter showed up for a free 2 topping large pizza. I paid much more for a speciality, although I did appreciate the letter. I let this go. Then today, I got home after picking up a pizza that had BBQ sauce on it, and when I called the store and told them I did not order BBQ sauce, he said \"yes you did, its not our mistake, it was placed online.\" I told him I ordered online before many times, and I did not select BBQ sauce as I know my son does not eat BBQ sauce, he repeated and said \"yes you did, its your mistake\", and kept on repeating this like a broken record. I don't feel it was my error, and even if it was, they clearly do not have customer service to make the customer happy, I got so angry I yelled, which I have not done in 10 years! That is how livid he made me. I WILL NO LONGER EVER BUY AT PAPA JOHNS EVER AGAIN. It is enough to have such treatment, to stop buying. This is the first yelp review I have ever written, as I could not get through their customer service number. Many people in their reviews here say 'bad service', and they are right, Don't waste your time and money. There is a papa murphy down the street on blue diamond which is great. All the best. J"}
{"text":"I will never order form again I spent 32 bucks for a nasty cold pizza and cold cheese sticks the veggies onto pizza wasn't even cooked right they still where a lil hard"}
{"text":"Pretty good for a pizza delivery place.  They're usually pretty quick with the delivery and my order is always correct."}
{"text":"Their pizza is always hot & fresh.  I placed on online order last week and somehow when I went to pick it up I had 3 pizza's!  I showed the confirmation email & explained I hadn't hit complete button & I went back and edited my order.  Jay was kind enough to give me those 3 pizzas for the price of one instead of throwing them away.  I thanked him and apologized sincerely.  I will continue to do the business with them ..... it's the best pizza in my opinion!"}
{"text":"I was staying at Presbyterian Hospital with my boyfriend after surgery and was tired of the food selection downstairs so I thought ..... PIZZA!  I checked online for the nearest location  of Papa John's and I called to make sure they could deliver to the hospital and it was no problem.  I placed my order online and in no time I got the call he was a minute away.  When I made it downstairs the delivery man was already waiting on me!  He was extremely pleasant and personable.  I could have sold the pizza four times before I made it back to the fifth floor!    The pizza was still hot and extremely GOOD - we even offered his nurse a piece and she gladly acceptedl.  The only reason I didn't give them 5 stars is because I ordered mushrooms on half because my boyfriend doesn't like them and it was on the whole pizza ( I loved it though)."}
{"text":"My kids love Papa John's so I always order from there, I personally like the thin crust better so my husband always has to order two, one regular cheese crust for the kids and a thin crust for me!   What I die for is the big, round, chocolate chip cookie for dessert.  I can eat it all by myself.  I also love the cinnamon sticks!!!!!!!  If they ever made a mistake with my sodas or something they are always very accommodating and come right back to my house with the correct order, doesn't happen often though!  i live in Huntersville and always order on line."}
{"text":"Staff is totally incompetent. Claimed they tried to call to confirm the order before making it yet they send you a confirmation of your order. Ordered online and they claim this was the policy which they made up to cover their ass for their incompetence.   The lady was extremely rude to us on the phone and offered no apology. Would avoid this place like the plague."}
{"text":"I love this place. they have never gotten an order wrong and have always been really nice to me. It is the closest papa johns to me and that's still a long drive so my pizza is never hot when i get it home and that will usually make a pizza taste bad but i have not had a bad pizza yet. its great food as a reasonable price"}
{"text":"Pizza and cheese sticks were good. However, the girl handling the pizza doughs is nasty. She was working on pizza dough with her bare hands and she kept stepping out of the store and grabbing her phone and did not wash her hands. She also did not have a hair net on and her hair was all over the place."}
{"text":"Ordered 2 pizzas an hour and a half ago. Was told 40 minutes. Called them at the 1 hour mark and they said the driver should be there any minute. 30 minutes later and no driver. Called again and they're not even apologetic and refuse to let us speak to any kind of manager."}
{"text":"Pizza arrived promptly. Found hair in my pizza, which triggered a gag reaction and caused me to vomit profusely. Disgusting and unacceptable. Needless to say, I lost my appetite and immediately discarded the pizza. Called the restaurant and the manager offered me another pizza -- OH HELL NO. Ended up asking for the charges to be credited back to my credit card (thank God I didn't pay with cash)  Eat there at your own risk."}
{"text":"Incompetent reps  taking phone orders. Couldn't get my order correct after 4 tries. I told them they need to get someone competent on the phone taking taking orders."}
{"text":"I order from this Papa John's location twice a month or more on average. I usually use the phone app to place the order and pick up the order myself (carryout, not delivery). I have found this location to meet my expectations although, I have to admit that my standards aren't terribly high for this kind of establishment; if they give me what I order in a manner that is pleasant in the time frame they said, then I am happy. In my experience, my pizza is ready when my confirmation email has said it would be (usually 15 to 25 minutes). The pizza is hot and made with the correct toppings (I usually order a one topping large; half with mushrooms and the other half plain cheese). The quality of the ingredients is good. The pizza I receive seem to be reasonably carefully made since the crust around the edge is usually a consistent thickness; all the pieces have sauce and cheese; and the pizza is cut so the mushrooms are on half of the pieces and plain cheese on the other half. Sometimes some pieces are larger than others but since the pizza is cut by hand that can sometimes happen. Once my pizza pieces weren't cut all the way through which made for a somewhat messy pizza since the pieces had to be torn off or recut to come apart cleanly. The staff has always been perfectly pleasant to me--I give my name and they give me my pizza. If I walk in and the staff member is in another part of the store, he or she usually comes over to help me relatively quickly. If I paid through the app they say I am all set to go or if I choose cash they tell me the total and ring me out. In my experience with carryout pizza, this Papa John's location performs well."}
{"text":"ONE WORD- SHITTY! I ordered a pizza at around 3pm for 10pm-10:30pm very nice about it the guy I ordered it from. Went to pick up the pizza at 10:25 and door was locked knocked on window and said WE ARE CLOSED! I said I had a question, I ordered and was told I can pick it up at 10:30pm the LATEST! He said I called and said 10:10pm was the latest you can pick it up and he said I called 2 times w/ a voicemail never one did I RECIVE IT! Did I mention he shut the door in MY FACE WITHOUT A WORD! Turned around and left never again! I was looking for a heart shaped pizza he said they can do it w/ out a problem! ALL BULLCRAP! Never got my pizza(luckily I didn't pay yet) CALLED TODAY TO COMPLAIN AND LADY SAID OH IT WAS VOIDED! I asked why she said I don't know 15sec of SILENCE she said oh do u want me to order it again I said no I asked who worked last night and said I don't know and said BYE! CRAPPIEST PLACE EVER!"}
{"text":"I would like to say I'm very pleased  with  the food  I've  been  receiving from this  location. Every now  and then  they make a mistake  but  ha  were all human. They have  new management  and the place  has really  turned  around not that  it was terrible before.  My family and I would highly recommend this  place  try it out!"}
{"text":"I don't usually write negative reviews, I understand everyone has off days but this takes the cake. Placed a phone order at 11:20 told it would be ready for pickup at 12:00, showed up at 12:10 and was told the food wasn't ready because they ran out of dough. Yes, you read that correctly, a pizza place ran out of dough on a Friday afternoon, 2 hours after opening, and apparently didn't think it was important enough to call us back and inform us. They did offer a discount, but still superbly poor planning and horrendous customer service/appreciation. So the original 40 minutes is now closer to 2.5 hours, unfortunately they have a pizza monopoly in their present location so they will unlikely lose business, hopefully they get better management who knows how to order appropriately."}
{"text":"Awful awful awful! Ordered pizza online to be picked up at 8 pm. Upon arriving, we were missing half of the order, and then told we ordered incorrectly. Fine, whatever, not a big deal. On top of that, the pizza was cold, (practically frozen) so we didn't want it;  then the rude cashier said she can't return it because we ordered it at 6pm. We showed her the order was to be picked up at 8 and she finally returned it after insulting us multiple times. Never going to this location again. AVOID!"}
{"text":"I gave this location my address and phone number 3 different times and  they still delivered to the wrong address. To top it off the employee didn't even seem to care that they Fd up. This place will never get my money again!"}
{"text":"This review is about this one location's unacceptable behavior.  To start, I like Papa John's.   * The pizza is reasonably tasty for my family (not as good as the local top notch mom  & pop places, but decent none-the-less.)   * The value is exceptional - they have the best specials, which we always take advantage of. Their online ordering and REWARD program is unparalleled (I belong to  every chains reward and email clubs, they are all pathetic. Not PJ's! Join and find out!)   * My local PJ is a franchise that in my opinion is a model for any franchise of any type. They know us by face and by name and greet us so when we come in. The food is well prepared and consistent. They service is fast and extra friendly. They rarely screw-up; and IF they do they are apologetic and fast to fix it in a method that we prefer.  So... What about THIS LOCATION??  We were having a family gathering in Phoenix and someone said \"Let's get pizza! We'll have Domino's deliver!\"  \"Wait!\" I said. As the pater familias I decided to treat everyone and said \"Can we do Papa John's? That's all we ever order and it's great. I think I have a free pizza or two waiting for me anyway?\"  \"Well we usually get white pizza with spinach and veggies from Domino's\" the vegan Phoenician daughter chimed in.  \"No problem. Papa John' has that too.\"  \"Do they have an online configurator so I can pick our toppings?\" she continued.  \"Yeah, it's great.\"  \"Do they still give that Garlic Butter sauce to dip your crust in? That's the main thing we always liked from there.\"  \"Domino's is super cheap...\" she challenged.  \"Let me login and order. They have great specials, I've got freebies coming. You can pick your own toppings. I'll order delivery and pay online including tip for driver.  We'll be eating in under a half hour.\"  \"OK, dad.\"  Online I go. Couple big loaded pizzas for about 10 bucks each, couple free 2-liters of  soda, an apple pie desert pizza at half price. Paid online. Done!!!  Problems begin.   50 minutes later the delivery guy arrives. Someone gets the door, then calls me \"to sign the receipt.\"  I come to the door to sign. I only see the pizza's so I ask about  the drinks. The zombie with the hot bag blank stares at me with glazed-over eyes usually seen only on reggae musicians. I sign. There is still no response. I ask again  about the drinks and the desert pizza. The expressionless zombie mumbles and someone  behind me yells \"we got it all dad!\"  OK!    \"Thanks!\" I say to zombieman, who slowly turns and shuffles away with no response. He was well tipped, but maybe I needed to offer fresh brains instead of cash to show appreciation to him.  Problems continue.   We open up the pizza boxes. The crusts are uber dark and burnt in many spot. Cheese is mostly brown. I pick up and bite into a piece of  Spinach Alfredo and it crunches. It  is completely dry, sauce was cooked away. Cheese was dried out too. Both pizzas were like this.  \"Gross!\"  \"Ewww\"  \"This is inedible\" \"They burnt this this!\" \"Call them back and tell them.\"  were the comments ringing from all my spawn.  \"Sorry guys!  I'll take care of it. I ordered these 'well-done' as I always order every pizza. It makes the cheese 'break' a little and makes the crust better for dipping. I've talked to store managers about this and know just what they do. The pizzas are amazing that way. Someone screwed these up. They are burnt. I'm sorry.\" I  lamented.  Problem gets worse.  I call in. I explain the problem. I ask what they did to mess these up. Unapologetically, the fellow on the other end explains how they cooked the pies and seems to know the correct  method for well-done pizza. As a retired restaurateur, I can only figure either the pizza handled did something different, or the ovens in that store are turned-up a bit for faster cooking which fouls up a \"well done\" order.   Either way, they guy on the phone was apathetic but said \"We can remake those for you.\"  \"Ok. Thanks.\" I say \"These are inedible.\" ...click... \"OK, guys! They are making new pizzas!  AN HOUR LATER.  Let me repeat.  AN HOUR LATER, a snarly, untipped female driver brings  2 perfectly cooked \"well done\" pizzas.  By that time, my hungry spawn had torn out and devoured all the semi-burnt-but-still-somewhat-edible-as-long-as-they-are-covered-with-ranch-dressing center nuggets of the unholy abominations this location had first delivered.  The group had subsequently moved on to the livingroom to watch True Blood.   \"Hey, the new pizzas are here! They are prefect! De-LISH!\"   But no one was interested any more."}
{"text":"If you like Papa John's, this place does a good job. Even late night delivery and take-out are great."}
{"text":"I love Papa Johns Pizza, but this location is horrible! The only reason I've ordered here multiiple times throughout the years is because it's closer than my favorite local pizza joint and they deliver. My problem? Oh gee, where do I begin? Overly burnt pizza? Check. Giving me less wings than I ordered? Check. And for a good laugh, I once even had a pizza delivered from this location that wasn't even cut! Seriously! They try to make it right and offer me free pizzas which I've refused almost every time. The one time I took them up on the offer and tried to use the voucher they gave me, the delivery guy said he couldn't accept it and that I had to call the manager! I slammed the door in his face. They can offer me all the free pizzas they want. But if they're going to keep making mistakes this much, it's just not worth it to me. Again, Papa Johns is awesome. This location? Not so much. I've given them multiple chances and I'm done."}
{"text":"I have been a long time customer of this location for years. However last night was easily our SECOND worst experience with them. We ordered dinner around 5pm on a Wednesday night. It took them approximately 30-40 minutes to deliver our order. That was not the part where things went upside down.     After about an hour after delivery we realized we were short 1 soda out of the 2 we ordered. I thought they are human, mistakes can happen so I called the location and politely told them we were supposed to get two sodas as per our order indicated. They said \"no problem we will get that right out to you.\" So, an hour goes by and no soda. I call again and speak to a \"manager\" called Adam. He ACTUALLY said that was because you\" only ordered 1.\" (Now, bare in mind, I had the order in front of me on my email!\") So, i politely corrected him and read off that it clearly says \"2, 2-Liter Pepsi\". Then, he proceeds to say \"oh, I see now. I will get that right out to you.\"     After I hang up ANOTHER hour passes and again no soda. (If you are keeping track this is the 2nd attempt now and 2 hours later.)  Then after that hour passed, I contacted them again and said \"I still have not received my soda.\" The same manager said \"as soon as my driver gets back I'll have him rush that out to you. For your trouble I'm going to put 2 free pizzas on file for you. I apologize for the inconvenience.\" Finally, an hour and half after that call, it arrives! Who knew a 2-Liter soda would take nearly 3.5 hours to be delivered that we paid for.     All that said, we used to live next to the Regional Manager and he fixed our FIRST major issue for us. But, he has since moved out of state to be a Regional Manager in the Midwest. I would call the Franchisee Owner or the new Regional Manager, but no idea how to reach them.  :("}
{"text":"If I could put -5  I would  This location does NOT follow any kind of food safety and food handling procedures  They DONT wear hair nets and the lady that I asked about hair nets boldly told me WE DONT WEAR THOSE HERE !!!   They have NEVER got my order correct either.  I have even gone as far as to email head office and still nothing has changed !   DONT WASTE YOUR MONEY   I EVEN REFUSED THE FREE PIZZA that they wanted me to have for the slack service.  Now why would I want anything again from a place that's NASTY AND DIRTY AND ALLOWS THE DRIVERS TO WALK THROUGH THE KITCHEN WHENEVER THEY PLEASE. No hand washing   Just gross and shitty service !!!"}
{"text":"This has been our \"go to\" pizza delivery for years. Every once in a while, the order gets messed up, but that is to be expected anywhere. Last week we ordered and it was incorrect. Made a call and Connie, who was super cool, offered a new pizza or a credit for the pizza that was messed up. It was late, so we opted for the credit. Forward to tonight, I called and this other lady tells me that she will give me the pizza for $8 and change and then acts like she's doing me a favor. No thanks. It isn't about the money. It's about doing what you said you are going to do. I don't get it. Why would you go out of your way to piss off a long time customer? Connie, I appreciate the gesture. Other manager girl, not so much."}
{"text":"Ok so we ordered on the Super Bowl I ordered at 3:00 with a person that I couldn't understand and was very slow, this is a review from an actual customer not from a competitor. About an hour later I decided to call them back because the group was very hungry. It turns out the person taking the order wrote my phone number down wrong so I reordered it. 30 minutes later we got it we asked her if we could have a discount, she said no, REALLY?!?!? And then when she was going in her car she said to herself, \"what an idiot\". What kind of service is that?!? The pizza wasn't that good either. All that waiting for nothin."}
{"text":"Ordered pizza and wings online. Went to pick it up, and they had some of the most incompetent employees I have ever seen. First, it took 3 employees to ring up a customer ahead of me, they didn't know how to work the register. After about 8 minutes they managed to ring her up. Then as I approached the register, all of the employees scattered like roaches. I stood there for another 5 minutes without any sort of acknowledgement. At this point more customers had shown up. There were about 10 people working, but none of them were manning the registers. I finally spoke up and requested a manager. He was a hot hefty mess, I questioned him briefly about his managing skills. All in all this location was subpar. It took me 30 minutes, not including the drive. To pick op my pizza that was already made, and had been sitting on the ready line. Needless to say I will not be going back."}
{"text":"I'm pretty much done with this Papa John's. The only thing consistent in their service is the hour long delivery times and sending the wrong pizza with my order. I have enough Papa Points for a free pizza but I won't even use it because of this location."}
{"text":"I have tried and tried again to enjoy Papa John's pizza as I had when it was first starting out but it just gets worse and worse. The pizza looked like it had been dropped before given to me and the ingredients must be old because my stomach is in turmoil along with my guests. I want to enjoy the pizza but looks like this particular store is off the list. The pizza either comes burnt or raw. This time it came burnt, cold, and tossed around. I think it is time for the company to spend less time playing with sports stars and more time on quality control!"}
{"text":"Messed up my order last time - they said they were aware of it before leaving the store to deliver & delivered it anyway.  Wtf?  Lol.  & they kept my tip.  Mostly on time though."}
{"text":"I have ordered from this location MANY times and have never had any problems. I'm a bartender and therefore I'm a cash person. Today I ordered delivery from this location and requested change for a one hundred dollar bill, which I have also done many times before. Today I did not receive my order, but instead a phone call informing me that they only had $20 to make change with and if I wanted my DELIVERY order I'd have to go get change myself before the driver arrived. I even said,  my order is $30, can you just bring me $60 for change. That's a $10 tip for the \"inconvenience\" and I was still refused. I order from this location about once a week, after today I will NEVER give papa johns another dime."}
{"text":"Ordered at 6:40pm with an estimated delivery time of 47 minutes (max). Pizza tracker said approximate arrival of 7:20. Pizza tracker then changed to estimated arrival of 7:10. Pizza didn't arrive until 8pm. At that point the delivery driver refused to give us a receipt - we paid in cash. The pizza was only lukewarm and the garlic sauce was cold. Never again."}
{"text":"I have been a loyal Papa Johns customer for years.  However, this location really needs to be looked at.  I ordered online, as I always do, and received an email saying 30-40 minute wait.  After 1 hour I called.  John (who answered the phone) said HE was the only delivery driver and wait time was 1 1/2 hours.  SERIOUSLY?  I placed my order before noon!  I asked why no one had bothered to call me (they took my money fast enough but can't be bothered to speak with me?) and was told they don't do that.  Well I DON'T DO YOU anymore then."}
{"text":"Won't be eating here ever again. Not only do they sponsor the NFL, who are a bunch of over paid morons, but they just fired their CEO for speaking out against their piss poor choice to disrespect our country and flag. Jerks don't deserve to be in business."}
{"text":"My daughter got me a Papa John's e-giftcard for Fathers Day and I got two orders off of that and fell in love with Papa John's.  I like the $10,3 topping, pan special.  I get ranch sauce with chicken, onion, and pineapple.  Never fails, ALWAYS AWESOME!!  Maybe because I get the ranch they're fresher?  Maybe the others are ready sitting around?    I was so impressed I got 2 more this month and then got each of my 2 daughters (FL) and one of my sisters (FL as well) $25 gift e-cards.  And EACH gift card came with a FREE 1-topping large for ME!!  Since I had pigged out twice already this month I gave the free ones to friends.  Delivery MAY be a tad slow, but I live so close I'm going to do carryout from now on.  That way if I ever do get a bad pizza I can turn it down right there.  It also avoids the STUPID $3.35 delivery fee....which they say is NOT a tip!!  I live a block away....Johnny WTF!?!"}
{"text":"Not happy with their service at all. They take forever to deliver and everytime have an excuse that they are busy. The people on the phone are rude as well"}
{"text":"2 out of the 4 pizzas delivered for my party we're great. 2 of them were burnt on the bottom and the dough inside was raw. Unfortunately, I didn't realize this until after some others ate it. Called in to let them know and was told that they can't do anything about it after I have accepted the pizzas. So unfortunate since it's the closest one. Definitely will not return."}
{"text":"Very disappointing.  The prices are high.  I drive to this location, less than a 1 mile from home, walk in and place an order.  The guy tells me 30-40 minutes for a walkin order.  I immediately ask why so long as a walk in?   He replays because they are busy and are behind.  I have worked at a pizza place before and thought that excessive but what could I say?  I wait in ,y truck for just over 15 minutes and decide to go back in to wait since hopefully it will be closer to 30 minutes and if lucky less.  As I walk in not only is my pizza done but also has been for awhile.  Very disappointed to get a warm pizza and not hot.    I rarely order from this place because whether delivery or pick up, same bull, moderate food for a high price."}
{"text":"Today was horrible I ordered a pizza online and didn't get here for over an hour. The driver was incompetent like how can you not find my address LOL seriously an apartment complex right off of McQueen. However the pizza was garbage and the garlic knots were dry. I was sad I love papa johns this location will never receive my business ever again. Oh ya one more thing they forgot my 2 liter of Pepsi & I told the driver he stated \"uh no that's not on my receipt, you didn't order a soda.\" & left uneducated dumba** can't even handle delivering pizza."}
{"text":"Ordered a pizza online. Got a call from the store telling me that the driver said that there was nobody home. I was home. I guess the driver didn't bother to knock or ring the bell. Unbelievable."}
{"text":"How can I describe my situation other than the most horrible customer service in the world waited no for pizza shows up after an hour and then driver was rude when I asked if this was the 30 minute old pizza we ordered ????? Called the manager which was a waste of time sure wish there was the owner I could talk too about this place lots of bad reviews gee I wonder why !!!! Big chain pizza store with terrible service maybe Papa John should focus on his stores instead of making commercials !!!!"}
{"text":"Ordered a pizza today, had it delivered, My husband dropped the pizza at the door the pizza was fine even though some of it came out of the box,the deliver guy said he would talk to his mananger about getting us another one I told him the pizza was fine ,but he call his mananger anyway and got us a new pizza That was so thoughtful and considered,  you dont see that much any more Papa John's gets 5 Stars for caring for there customers THANK You"}
{"text":"This is awful. $90 Pizza order cover an hour late. Keep getting put on hold and my colleague just got barked at and hung up on. Saying they were busy. Worst experience I have ever had. I still don't have pizza. I emailed for a status update. Spent over 10 minutes on hold."}
{"text":"We ordered pizza to be delivered at our home at 11:30 at night. How busy could they be, right?!?! It took an hour for them to deliver the pizza to our house and there was bad service from the employees."}
{"text":"Honestly, this is the worst food I've ever purchased.  I was a Papa Johns fan for years but just can't believe how horrible it's gotten...at least at the 4th Street location.  Flavorless, undercooked, and late.  It was raw once before when I ordered and this time I specifically asked for it cooked well, but still raw dough, flavorless, and gross.  This is my first yelp review in life.  Had to sign up just to inform others not to waste their money. Papa Johns should be ashamed of themselves."}
{"text":"I called in an order to this Papa John's and was told it would arrive in 35 mins, however I expected 45 to be safe. An hour later it still hadn't arrived. I called the store and was placed on hold for 6 and half mins. I hung up, called back and asked about the status of my order. I was told at first it would arrive in 30 mins. I asked why 30 mins, if it has already been an hour. I was told if it doesn't arrive in another 10 - 15 mins to call back and speak to the manager. I called back in 20 mins and spoke to the manager only to find out that my order was never placed. Epic fail!"}
{"text":"Simply put this is the best Papa Johns in Charlotte.  Consistently good pizza and great service!"}
{"text":"Gross! I generally love Papa Johns, but this one is lacking in all areas. I ordered PJs for lunch and once it finally arrived (1 hour later), it was luke warm and soggy. Apart from that, the staff lacks any work ethic or customer service. The three people I dealt with were all rude and careless. Initially, they ended up giving me a $5 credit. Ha! As if I would order again anyway."}
{"text":"Very slow. Anticipate at least 1.5 hours minimum for delivery no matter what time you order. 2 hours is more common."}
{"text":"Their pan cheese pizza is horrendous!...but when it comes to delevery time its great."}
{"text":"People here dont know what customer service is. Very bad experience never going back there. I will drive to next store 4 miles away to get my pizza next time."}
{"text":"Usually order online for delivery (and occasionally pickup) about 1-2x a month. Never had a real issue. Orders are correct and arrive in a reasonable amount of time (usually a lot before the estimated arrival time. I feel that I tip a fair amount, so perhaps that has something to do with it). It's a bit surprising to read other reviews complaining about incorrect orders, late delivery times, etc.  One time I placed an order for delivery, only to find that a family member already brought home some pizza, so I called the store to cancel my order and the staff member was professional and was able to cancel my order with no issues.  I always use one of their special offers/coupons when ordering online.  Love their thin crust and the special seasoning (even though it's probably all sodium)."}
{"text":"Horrible customer service. I'm only reviewing based on me calling in and placing my order. The guy on the phone was not friendly n was cut short. Lord only knows what I'll get when I go and pick up my order. Only cause I'm hungry otherwise I wouldn't bother since they have bad reviews anyway.  *update: to my surprise (why am I still surprised) they hadn't made my order because someone forgot. The guy rectified the situation by having our order ready in 5 minutes (don't know how I feel about that cause we're dealing w food here) and he offered to give us a free brownie n drink if we stayed. I only gave them a chance at this point because I was hungry, it was late n I had just arrived from Los Angeles."}
{"text":"Meh.ok pizza. This place has staffing problems.Usually weird and incompetent. If you take better care of your employees it pays"}
{"text":"I love Papa John's actual pizza, but this location will not deliver it to me and has pretty bad service skills. I am 3 miles to the east, and they will not deliver because I am on the East side of a crossroad. So they gave me a number to a Papa Johns 5 miles northeast of my home. When I called them, they confirmed that the location 3 miles away is my locations Papa Johns, and that they should deliver. Because a manager denied quality service to his entire delivery area, he lost out on a sale tonight, and many future sales. I would drive to go get it, but the service over the phone was not worth my attention to give them a second thought. Customer service really is everything, even in the small things."}
{"text":"This Papa Johns is seriously slow on delivery. Every single time I order, its minimally 15-25 minutes later than the \"projected delivery time\".  The middles of the pizzas are often mushy (even on cheese pizzas) but the breadsticks are always really good."}
{"text":"Waste of money. Pizza was cold. Ordered carry out & had to wait 5 minutes for someone to help me while my pizza sat in the window getting cold. Pizza was cold, the toppings were skimpy & they shorted my order of chicken poppers which were gross anyway. Wouldn't order from here again."}
{"text":"I have placed several orders at this location, only to find out after a month of living at that apartment that some (most) of the delivery staff seem to smoke in their delivery vehicles.  The box of the last order I placed reeked of smoke.  In subsequent weeks when I saw Papa John's delivering other pizzas to neighbors the delivery staff was almost always smoking in the car when they pulled in.  Nasty, unhealthy, and have not ordered from this Papa John's in well over a year nor will I ever again."}
{"text":"I ordered from this location last night around 10:15. I got a medium pizza (the works) and the bacon cheese breadsticks. About an hour after eating a few slices of each I began to feel sick but didn't think anything of it. However, by 1am I was curled up next to the toilet until 9am. I threw out the rest of the food and vow to never order from this location again. In fact, this incident has completely ruined the entire restaurant for me. I hope this location gets it together before they wind up hurting someone even worse."}
{"text":"I dont know why papa johns has a 1 star i give it a 5 star. i love papa johns its way better then dominos, This pizza place saved my starving stomach tonite most of the other places wouldnt even deliver to me because it was out of their way even offering a extra tip on top of the delivery charge. this pizza didnt even take long to get to me and filled me up, after waiting two hours from another pizza guy to get here i will never order from angelinas pizza again...thank you papa johns"}
{"text":"A few weeks ago I ordered a pizza here they had a blackout I got my pizza 3hrs late i even drove to get it, the manager Ana apologized and said we could have 2free pizzas another day Weeks pass I ordered the two free pizzas before I ordered I ask to make sure they said yes I come in to pick up thinking I'm a tip$$ pizzas are free, great!! Manager Ana is here now she says sorry if I made a mistake it was one free pizza I said ok fine whatever we pay the extra pizza then she says u guys ordered large the free pizzas where medium.. BTW I called and asked for the free pizzas cuz that's what I wanted!! Now she's raising her voice at me saying she has to throw away pizzas my boyfriend offers to pay.. now our bill is $25 from 2free pizzas... which we are thinking ok maybe our mistake but she's telling me we made a mistake now she has to throw away food she hates throwing away food etc at this point I tell my bf lets go we were about to pay but her attitude was horrible and at this point I just never want to deal with her again"}
{"text":"The former papa johns closed and reopened in the same shopping center.  It is terrible pizza. I don't blame the staff or delivery folks.  Wonderful.  But since we have virtually no pizza delivery in Cave Creek, papa johns is pretty much it.  So my winter visitors order papa johns and the consensus is always that it sucks. They are just baking pre made pizza.  I see the refrigerator trucks unloading there   This isn't a hit on this franchise. I hated it everywhere I've lived.  I feel like a heroin addict ordering Papa Johns.  I need the drug (pizza) but I know I'm killing myself with this dope"}
{"text":"This used to be my go to place for pizza, but recent encounter makes me give up on the idea of eating pizza. I had ordered pizza and garlic knots, the way I got it, they might have as well just given dough to eat, it was that bad and very upsetting. Worst was store manager didn't knew how to address this, instead I had to take the pizza to the store to show them how gross it was.  Do yourself a favor and order from a better place"}
{"text":"Called to make sure my order went through and the woman who answered was beyond rude. She only answered with, \"well what time did you order?\" Terrible costumer service."}
{"text":"The people that work at this location are SOOO nice!   I highly recommend getting your pizza here. It's a clean location and my order is always correct.  The delivery drivers kindly hold open the door for me when I'm comig and going.   :)  Seriously, they're good people here."}
{"text":"This Papa Johns is great! Fast service easy to order online with the app. Friendly delivery drivers. Pizza and garlic knots are great!"}
{"text":"If you want a pizza delivered you don't have too many options. I'd probably choose dominos instead. If all you want is something simple like a pepperoni pizza, they'll do the job. I just wouldn't get too excited about the taste of their specialties."}
{"text":"Called to order a small pizza and was convinced by the trainee on the phone to get their deal which is a  large pizza and then you get another for 30 cents. They deliver a large pizza, charge us full price and when I called back to ask where the 2nd pizza was, they said we didn't order the second one.   Called to ask why we didn't get our 2nd pizza as sold to us and as advertised on TV, the manager Kevin would do nothing to fix the problem and was completely rude and clueless to boot.  Mediocre food and terrible service from this location. Hasn't been my first time here but will be the last. Order elsewhere, there are a dozen other pizza places nearby and they're all multitudes better than this place."}
{"text":"I'm staying at the grand view which is way south from the strip. We ordered online, a little confusing at first but not impossible, great delivery time and the pizzas were perfffffect. They didn't actually come to the room but the delivery guy called and politely asked us to come downstairs to meet him. All around great service and I can't complain! Whiners can go home."}
{"text":"Came in here to grab a pick up. Not only did there credit card machine not work, but they were the most rude people I have ever ordered food from. Not coming back to papa Johns that's for sure."}
{"text":"Love Papa John's, location is clean. Young lady behind the register was quite rude and snappy. Will not be back to this location."}
{"text":"The pizza is pretty decent!  My kids always like it and it's consistently good. My complaint is about their call queue system.  I called to make a delivery order on a Saturday night and was asked to hold.  I waited at least 15 minutes and while I was waiting, my husband called from his phone too.  He was put on hold for about 3 minutes and then someone picked up to take his order...WHILE I WAS STILL ON HOLD.  He made the order and I hung up but obviously, their call queue is screwed up.   Do yourself a favor and call from multiple phones!"}
{"text":"I realize that franchises are owned by different groups, can be run by different people, and can have a general inconsistency across their universe. Even if all locations start with the same ingredients and instructions, results differ. Chains are very difficult to review because of that. Some do a good job, some don't.  There are good things and bad things about Papa John's. First, I want to say that I have always found the staff here to be friendly and accommodating, no matter when I would go there. I also think Papa John's online ordering system to be rather convoluted. Once, no matter what I tried, the system would not recognize their promo code. While I understand the kinks have been worked out, I just find it quicker and easier to get on the phone and call them.  But by going online you can get some interesting information. I had a coupon for a one-item, medium pizza for $7.99 that I wanted to use. I called and used it to order a pepperoni pizza. By going online I could see that it should come with 32 slices of pepperoni. It actually came with 28 slices, a full 12.5% under what was advertised. I don't know if the discrepancy was the result of an overzealous corporate advertising manager, an employee not being correctly trained, or a local manager trying to cut expenses. But I know I felt slighted. You should NEVER get less that what's promised.  The pie measured a full 12 inches across, but the edge crust measured between 1 and 1 1/2 inches in places. The container of garlic dipping sauce helps, even enhances, devouring those crust edges. I found the pizza sauce to be sweet, the cheese a bit less than I prefer (is someone skimping on cheese?), and the crust to be much like most other places. All in all I think it would be indistinguishable from most other chains (except those really bad ones, you know who you are) in a blind taste test. I was disappointed because, while I haven't eaten their pizza in a while, I always found them to be better than most. For that reason I am going to have to give them only three stars."}
{"text":"Terrible phone system. Unable to take a delivery on Tuesday night, just continued to push the potential client to hold. Waited on hold for five minutes, but no answer , called back three times... same thing. Extremely disappointed. Will never call back."}
{"text":"Spent literally 30 minutes on the phone just trying to order. The kid couldn't spell to save his life and when I tried multiple times to spell it for him, some how he still got it wrong. A manager finally took over, got my address in 5 seconds, and naturally handed me back to the original idiot.   Finally get my order in and he tells me a price, says it includes delivery fee and taxes....food gets here and it's $10 more than he said and I still have to tip because it wasn't the drivers fault. We only ordered 3 pizzas, WTF is wrong with this place? This is now the second time they've screwed up, last time I ordered online and somehow they messed up 2 of the 3 pizzas, never again. Find somewhere, ANYWHERE else."}
{"text":"We order here a lot and the pizza is good and staff is friendly. We will NEVER order delivery again- an hour and 15 mins for ONE PIZZA Then the guy that delivers it tells me sorry my shift started at 5 and i got here as quick as I could, thats great buddy but I ordered my pizza at 4pm why are you the one delivering it?!?!?!??!  I literally live 5 minutes away I could have walked there and back and been happier.  Thanks papa johns."}
{"text":"placed phone order for delivery and wasn't ask if it was cash or credit, so I had to call back and ask, then when the driver came he didn't have a way to take credit cards, so he had to call back the store and they put him on hold. Kinda felt bad for the driver but there wasn't anything I could do."}
{"text":"Quick delivery and cannot stress enough to register for email deals because i never pay full price.  Savings up to 50% off regular price!"}
{"text":"I know it gets busy and all in restaurants. But when I ordered a pizza over 45 minutes ago, and the guy who just walked in before me was just ordering his pizza and got it before me is a little weird. And then have to wait 20 minutes after my pizza was done to get breadsticks it's kind of bullshit. The guy at the counter Billy didn't acknowledge me when I came in, and started helping people that came in after me. Used to love this location."}
{"text":"We ordered 2 extra large 16\" pizzas. When I went to pick up the pizzas I commented that both pizzas appeared  small and how the box appeared to be too large for the pizzas. 2 employees assured me that both pizzas were 16\".   When I arrived home with the pizzas my wife also commented how small they were so we took out a ruler and measured them both at 14\" which is the size of a \"Large\" not the 16\" \"Extra large\" which we ordered and paid for. I drove back to Papa Johns on Anthem Village Dr. with the pizzas and asked for the manager. He told me that both pizzas were 16\" and there was NO PROBLEM. I then pulled out my ruler and the manager said well if you want I will remake them for you. The franchise owner is having the employees make smaller than ordered size pizzas and charging the customer for the larger size. They are now also charging $0.10 per packet for cheese & red pepper. Time to find another pizza place in 89052 that does not steal from customers."}
{"text":"Bunch of haters on here man, it's pizza delivery not a 5 star culinary experience. I order my pizza online and it shows up twenty minutes later, it's not rocket surgery."}
{"text":"If I could give 0 stars I would. We placed an order for delivery. It arrived 40 minutes late. On top of that, my husband and I got very sick after eating the pizza from this location. I mean VERY sick. I never call to complain. It just isn't something I do. But this was such a disaster I had to. When I called to speak to the manager, she had an attitude right from the start. She said with a snarky tone,\"Did you go to the doctor.\" I said I can assure her that we both got food poisoning after eating their pizza and I did not want to get graphic to describe it. She then said under her breath that she doubted it. That made me really upset. She was so rude. I would have never questioned a customer like that. I said that I didn't like her attitude and if it would be better for me to settle this through corporate she would. She then stepped up her hateful tone but did say she would refund my money. That's fine, I guess, because I never intend to order from Papa Johns again. I recommend that no one eat food that was prepared at this location. If they are that terrible with customer service, imagine how sloppy they are with food preparation. I'm really disgusted that I consumed their nasty over-sauced, slimy pizza and was violently sick because of it. Terrible decision!"}
{"text":"Terrible customer service. Ordered 4 pizzas, didn't have the selected pizzas, they said they called and left a vm. They did not call or leave a message yet cancelled the order. Rude manager and horrible service."}
{"text":"I happen to like Papa johns pizza so I give it 4 stars. I feel it tastes better than Taste of Italy. But that's just me."}
{"text":"The food is amazing. However, everytime i go for pick up or i order for delivery, i have to wait at least an hour. The other day, i was left waiting for an hour outside in my car. The employees were very rude and slow if u know what i mean. The person that took my order repeated my order several times but still ended up getting it wrong. I wont be visiting to this papa johns again anytime soon."}
{"text":"Awful Service-Order was wrong-they sent out another  pizza that looked like it had been put in the trunk of the delivery mans car- Rather than call the manager again-who was very rude -will call corporate instead. Complete waste of time-"}
{"text":"Not impressed with this location at all. For starters, they couldn't figure out how to honor a current coupon that was sent out in a mailer. Since it was the only reason I had called, that was discouraging. I ordered a pizza anyway and, a full hour later, it still had not arrived.   I called back to see what was going on and was told it was an issue with online orders. Good explanation - except I didn't order online and they didn't bother explaining how that had any effect on the current location of my dinner. Roughly ten minutes after I got off the phone, the pizza showed up - luke warm, full price, and disappointing.   At least one of those three terms can generally be applied to Papa Johns but all three at once is pretty unusual. Thankfully there is no shortage of mediocre pizza chains in the area."}
{"text":"It's unfortunate when you order pizza often for any particular event and when it's wrong they are quick to dismiss the issue instead of keeping a faithful paying customer happy. I ordered a pizza last week from a different store and when the pizza arrived, it was very undercooked, doughy and stretchy. I ordered a chocolate chip cookie as well and the cookie was burned around the edges and on the bottom. It also was two hours late on arriving. I spoke to the manager and he agreed to credit my account. Today, when attempting to place an order, they claimed they aren't able to accept other stores credit. That's unacceptable. I order from Papa John, I pay Papa John, I expect Papa John to make it right REGARDLESS where they made the mistake. Guess its to much to ask for; very unfortunate. For Papa John's being so concerned on customer satisfaction, in this case they failed miserably. We well know when a consumer is unhappy, they make changes. I'll have to go with pizza hut moving forward."}
{"text":"This place deserves more than 5 stars...I ordered pizzas to be delivered and the guy was super nice!!! My pizza was nice and hot when it arrived."}
{"text":"The worst pizza I have ever had, couldn't even eat ti. Better ingredients, better pizza, how they expect to pass what we had off as living up to that blows my mind. Where is the guarantee? I want my money back."}
{"text":"DO NOT order from here. I ordered half cheese half pineapple pizza and it came all pineapple I called the store to tell them and the guy working Troy tells me he made it like the order I said okay but thats not what I ordered and could he please make me a new one and bring it and exchange it he said no and then proceeded to tell me I should do a better job at reviewing me order. I asked to speak to someone else and he said I could call tommorow at 4pm and talk to his general manager but I was not getting a pizza tonight unless I paid for an entire new one I asked for a corporate number he told me sarcastically that he works for a franchise not a corporation.. Long story short my 10 year didn't get to eat and I am never ever ordering from Papa Johns again"}
{"text":"The cashier told us AFTER we paid that it would be a 30 minute wait for our \"fast food\" personal pizza order. We have been sitting here for 45 minutes and it still isn't complete. The WORST service and dining experience I have ever had!!"}
{"text":"The pizza was average and the cashier was pathetic, haven't met a stubborn arrogant prick like him. When asked for pepper flakes he stares back and says he dint have it when requested to check, stares at the ceiling and says \"I checked I don't have any\". Wonder how far that attitude will take him."}
{"text":"Worst attitude of store personnel I've ever seen for a while. First of all even though an employee was available (he asked me if I was picking up) I had to wait several minutes before the employee on the phone finished taking an order. The entire time the pizza order was sitting there under no heat lamps. Just sitting there. Which I questioned, because the order was placed to pick up at 2:30p. And it was just before 2:30p. I was told the pizza was made per the order and there was no note about 2:30p. I asked if the customer was wrong then? Again I was told the pizza was made per the order. So I paid and said I would take my cold pizza. Again the lady argued with me and said the pizza was warm. When I got to my friend's house and they heard I had to pay for the pizza they were a little miffed and called the store again. The lady gave a bunch of excuses including saying that I wasn't very pleasant. Unless you want to be the reason for their poor service I wouldn't recommend getting anywhere near this store."}
{"text":"Dave was very rude to me. I have never been treated like that at any papa johns. I have worked in Pizza fast food before and you don't talk to customers like that. And I've never been charged for a side of banana Peppers before and the way he talked was disrespectful. I will never come to this location ever again!"}
{"text":"They are the absolute worst and they have horrible and I mean horrible customer service. The manger is just as rude as some of the employes. I haven't order from there in a long while and don't plan to until some changes are made."}
{"text":"Last night they delivered a pizza so cold the included garlic sauce had congealed into a solid.  Time before they got the order wrong.  Won't be ordering from here again."}
{"text":"Please do not put flyers on people's cars. Obnoxious, invasive and it leads to littering."}
{"text":"If I could do less than one star I would.   My ordeal with these people started Super Bowl Sunday 2012. Pick the coin flip and win a free pizza. Nothing to lose right? My wife and I chose heads, America chose heads, it was heads in the game, everyone wins a free pizza.   Generally we only order pizza from mom and pop joints as they are better quality, taste and seriously the chains are just terrible, but this price was right.  Move ahead two weeks and we order the free pizza. And then we waited. And waited. And waited. 90 minutes later we get the pizza, nasty and cold.   A week later, in an effort to right their marketing wrong Papa Johns offers us a free pizza, two liter, and free side of our choice. We order and wait. And Wait. And wait. An hour after they were supposed to show they finally get here. Pizza is cold and nasty. And they forget the side. I realize $8 per hour doesn't exactly inspire the best work or get the best employees but when I called in the guy on the phone was rude and extremely unhelpful. No doubt he was used to fielding calls from angry customers.   The bottom line here is that this is terrible pizza, with even worse service and delivery. We didn't pay a dime (except for $2 delivery fee...twice) and we still feel like we got screwed. With so many other places to go to get your pie, save yourself the headache and wait of this dump. They should be out of business and hopefully will be soon."}
{"text":"I used to order all the time from this location and everything was great. Recently the time and order accuracy have gone down greatly. Today I called because the online coupon that they mailed out wasn't working and the \"manager\" not really sure she was, said she couldn't help me and seemed not to even mind that I wasn't happy and was not going to use this store again. If she really was a manager papa johns needs to train better because she is terrible. Our house probably orders from here twice a month and will definetly never order here again"}
{"text":"They did an amazing job on my pizza! Toppings tasted fresh, pizza was hot and cooked in a timely manner. Looovveeedd it! Thanks guys!"}
{"text":"I love going to places that I can order Papa Johns since I don't live close enough for them to deliver to me. Anyway the person that I spoke to on the phone was very polite and confirmed what I had order so I wouldn't get the wrong order. It took a little while to get to me but seeing as it was 8:30 on a Sunday night in Pittsburgh they were very busy. The delivery driver was extremely polite and in a great mood. When I told him to have a Merry Christmas he said he most definitely would. The day before was his 10 year anniversary of getting clean. That is amazing. Then he said if I knew anyone fighting addiction to let them know that there is a light at the end of the tunnel and just keep trying. It took him a few tries and a lot of praying to god but in the end god came trough for him. He was just a wonderful man he has made my night so much better just by meeting him. #ilovepapajohns."}
{"text":"Waited over an hour for my one pizza and they weren't even busy. The employees were bull shittin and never even started my bread sticks and let my pizza sit there and get cold. After I yelled at them they finally started my bread sticks. They all have attitudes and can't properly do an easy minimum wage job. NEVER GO TO THIS LOCATION! Zero stars but it won't let me"}
{"text":"Do not order or dine here. This place is a joke. I ordered one large pizza for delivery to my hotel. I had noticed this location is 2 miles from where I was staying so I specifically asked if they would be able to deliver to me. I was told that they would be able to, however it would be a wait time of an hour and 15 minutes. I gave my room number and my cell number for them to contact.   After approximately an hour and 15 minutes I called and asked how far my order was from being delivered. I was assured by Chris that it was on its way- maybe another 10 or 20 minutes.   30 minutes passes, I called Chris back and he could not find my order at first. I had to reiterate what I had ordered- a simple large pizza. No sides. Not a complicated order. I then was questioned by Chris who asked if I had canceled the order as his delivery person had told the manager that we had canceled- which simply wasn't true. I had now waited 2 hours for a pizza, and called three times total asking where my pizza was.    After getting the so called \"manager\" Deondra on the phone, she told me the only thing she could do would be remake the pizza but she could only give me a discount of half off. Half off a pizza I've waited 2 hours for?! Is that customer service? I was then told that the delivery person was the one that cancelled the order but she didn't specifically know the details as to why my order had been cancelled. Deondra also told me she was not familiar with the hotels in the area. I'm sorry if you're the manager of a pizza place how do you not understand the basic concept of delivering a pizza to a hotel? I could teach this concept to a sixth grader however after speaking with Deondra it's evident the competency just isn't there. As for the delivery person, I'm guessing he was lazy and didn't want to bother delivering to a hotel. Which is why when I had first ordered I specifically had asked if this would be an issue. My phone had no missed calls. The front desk staff said they hadn't seen any pizza delivery personnels.   Absolutely horrible manager (Deondra), horrible customer service and lazy, incompetent delivery. I wouldn't wish this experience on anyone."}
{"text":"I have tried many many times to order and think positive after each order.   They left me on hold on time almost 15 minutes after I placed an order and it took way over an hour.  Another time it took over 2 hours (no joke) to get the order, pizza was super cold!  they didn't care or apologize.  I'm waiting now... it's been an hour and according to the app it was supposed to be 20-30 minutes.  **Got it and it's cold again.    Will not order anymore. Unbelievable. Poor customer service. I have been super nice and have always tipped well. I'm honestly not ordering anymore."}
{"text":"The pizza is always late and the delivery guy is always rude and sounds drunk! If I could rate it less than a star I would."}
{"text":"This location of Papa John's is close to home, right near Mountain's Edge. I've never received delivery, I typically call ahead and pick up my order on the way home from work. I always have to wait even though I time it right, they just can't seem to get the estimated time right. Oh well...NBD cause I'm not cooking so I'm ok with waiting :) Just as long as the pizza is fresh, hot and good, it's worth is. I consider Papa Johns to be the better of the fast food pizza chains.  We've never had a bad pie from this location. I think we paid about $11 out the door for a Large up to 5 toppings. Personally I'd say their large is not really large. If we're hungry the two of us can eat almost the whole thing and then have 1 slice each for breakfast the next day :) mmmmm cold pizza breakfast, yum. Overall, a decent fast food pizza!"}
{"text":"Good pizza, fast delivery and convenient location!  We love Papa Johns, and the new garlic knots are always a hit with the kids too!"}
{"text":"Just called papa johns on a Sunday night, they are open until 11:30, I called in a pick up order at 11:00. The guy said that he won't take any pick up orders and only deliveries were accepted. I then told him I was right across the street. He then sighed dramatically over the phone and said \"I guess I can do that!\" I then told him he was a dick and that I didn't trust him making my food. Never again will papa johns get my biz."}
{"text":"I was desperate. One crying baby and a hungry toddler. I needed someone who delivered food and all I could think was pizza.  I didn't want Pizza Hut. I tried calling Lefty's and the number is no longer in service.  What to do, what to do... All I could come up with was Papa John's.  I ordered a large cheese pie which cost $8. I wish they would have took it back with them.  I guess I'm just not that type of pizza person.  It was really doughy. The sauce wasn't good and the cheese was a congealed mess on top. Ugh...  Other than the gross pizza, service was good.  Delivery was quick. The driver was friendly.  I wish my experience was better but it looks like I'm going to have to research more delivery places for when I'm in a  jam."}
{"text":"Ordered a pizza to be delivered. $13.50. The delivery guy shows up, I give him a $20. The smart ass arrogant jerk asked me if I needed change. He got a .50 cent tip. Will not be ordering from them again. Too many other places where I can get a pizza."}
{"text":"First time ordering from PJ's. Price and delivery time were decent.  Pizza was not sliced all the way, so we had to tear the slices apart.  We also ordered plain wings with Buffalo sauce on the side.  They sent ranch.  Our first time was also our last."}
{"text":"NEVER EVER AGAIN!  Ordered a extra large pizza.  Asked for well done and light sauce.  Neither happened.  Tons of sauce and lightly done.  The cheese has a texture of curdled milk.  Tried to call back for over an hour to complain and phone seemed to be off the hook.  Pizza was soggy and raw."}
{"text":"Oh the  Worst pizza ever! Thin & crispy is what I like, but not theirs! No hot peppers, no garlic sauce & not the toppings I ordered....plus the commercial says 9.99 for 5 toppings but the phone girl REFUSED..charging me an addiotional 2 bucks, plus then I found out the 2.75 delivery charge doesn't go to the delivery person, so tip extra 3 bucks...ironicly the only good thing about the expierence! # what a jip! Don't make the same mistake!"}
{"text":"It makes me feel a little better that I am not the only person who has had a problem with the doughy pizza here. Time after time I have ordered delivery and the pizza is raw in the center, the sauce is watery, and their offer to send out a new pizza has resulted in little improvement. This place has ruined Papa John's for me."}
{"text":"I had a great experience with them at 10pm last night. Order 2 medium pizzas and i was told it'll be 20 minutes but i was just down the road at papa johns that was closer to me but they turned me away cause they said that they dont do online orders nor pick up. Long story short i called this place first to see if they would allow me to come in and they said yes so told them that i was gonna order the 2 medium pizza 50 percent off and that if i still needed to do it online and they told me no that they will just take the order over the phone. So i was happy i didnt need to pull over and do the order online. Anyways i get there and i only waited 10 minutes for my order. Will definitely come back here again."}
{"text":"I love papa johns in general. I always get my favorite here and like the taste of it inline other locations. No five star because the wait time is occasionally super long but this location have dedicated stuff."}
{"text":"These mental midgets managed to forget the buffalo sauce on my buffalo chicken pizza. There is nothing more basic to creating a pizza than putting the sauce on it. Yet, in spite of what the driver described as a \"slow night \", these pea brains managed to screw it up.  Let's be honest, Papa John's has never been known for the highest quality of pizza. It's a great place to get something fast and decent. Well, they just lost \"decent\".  If you live in the East Valley, you can literally go to any other pizza place and get something better. Do yourself a favor and don't order from Papa John's."}
{"text":"Now that they are charging $.75 for 1 ounce for extra dipping sauce I'll be going somewhere else."}
{"text":"Too bad you can't give 0 stars. Literally the worst Papa Johns ever! I've ordered from there twice: first time they didn't include any of the sauces I paid for & I drove all the way back to pick them up. Tonight I ordered delivery and my husband answered the door. Why did the delivery driver pocket the money without asking if we needed change and then just stand there??? So rude! When I came to the kitchen to get food I saw we were missing a box. I called the store and the lady that answered couldn't have cared any less. She said I had two options: wait two more hours for them to bring my missing breadsticks, or get a \"quality assurance credit\". I reluctantly chose the credit & just let it be... until I opened the wings and found they all were TINY. I mean I could barely hold it without biting my finger. Ridiculous! I'm so disappointed. It takes a really terrible experience for me to write a negative review but I just had to share this mess as a warning."}
{"text":"This location is the worst papa john's ever. I liked papa john's in other cities. This one always find some way to mess up the pizza. Order here if you like any of the following: incorrect orders, cold pizza, burnt pizza, 3 hour deliveries, not enough cheese, toppings thrown on unevenly, brown spots on vegetables, 4 inch crust on one side and 1/2 inch crust on the other I mean really how do you even?"}
{"text":"Papa johns on anthem is closed. So surprised. Will be missed. Was only pizza place close to anthem. I can't rate it seeing it gone. Sad now that I have to make my own pizza and nobody likes it. Certain things I can't cook is Chinese and pizza because of the crust. How sad. Hope to see them back."}
{"text":"Whatever you decide, delivery or carry out its slow.  I ordered a large pizza with pepp,mushrooms and xtra cheese and the order taker said \"huh\" I said my order again and she passed the phone to someone else.  Ugh! At least the pizza was good."}
{"text":"My first time at this location was a success.  The store was clean and bright.  The staff was friendly and efficient.  The pizza was hot and the ingredients fresh and tasty.  What puts Papa John's above other takeout pizzas is the slightly sweet sauce they use.  Just like Mama use to make!"}
{"text":"I picked up a pizza from this location for the first time tonight.  The pizza was hot, fresh and delicious.  The ordering and pickup process was professional and efficient.  \"I'll be back!\""}
{"text":"Worst service and worst food. $35 paid for a pizza, a couple sodas, and breadsticks. Don't waste your time. There's better pizza right across the street at QuikTrip hot and ready at any time, and waaaay better pizza at Portofinos also across the street for half the price. If I wasn't feeling under the weather, I would have driven the couple miles to get real pizza. The 'pan' pizza I ordered was similar to Tony's frozen kind I can but for $2.99 and the food was all cold except for the soda. When I called, I got the clueless, millennial, entitled a$$hole who wanted to argue that my food was 'only' a half hour late and made a point to inform me that my house was the last in the driver's route. No wonder my food was cold. I weep for the future."}
{"text":"You can't put mushrooms on top of the cheese. Your joking right. That the manager said you can't,  well i have done it before. People need to answer the phone much better rather than saying uh uh with every word you speak. Pizza was good, but not how i wanted it. Mushroom on top of the cheese is it too much to ask for?!!!!"}
{"text":"So sad to see such negative reviews for this location! I live right around the corner and come here often and my experience has always been great! Everyone has always been super friendly and helpful and the pizzas are amazing!  Definitely try their desserts they by far the best dessert pizzas out of any delivery pizza place!"}
{"text":"We've had much better from PJ's...Not sure what happened on this order.   What happened to canned mushrooms? Or is that only in certain states?    Will try again"}
{"text":"We called this place to order a few pizzas for take out. We didn't know they closed at 9:30 for take out but the lady inside still took our order and when we got there, they said take out is closed and we can't receive our food. Solid waste of time. They were all outsides smoking blunts when we got there."}
{"text":"We get pizza here a lot because my son loves it. Tonight he was in charge and papa johns is for dinner. We usually pick it up but tonight we got delivery. The delivery guy was nice, the pizza got here fast and was hot. My son is enjoying his specialty no sauce pizza and I am eating the dreaded ham and pineapple. I did try the wings and they were terrible I cannot imagine anyone liking them. If they would have been good then I would have given 5 stars."}
{"text":"Worst customer service!!!! Even though their pizza is the best delivery in the area I will no longer be ordering from them. We had ordered from them 3 times and the delivery was always slow And you get placed on forever but the pizza was worth it. Not anymore! We placed an order online they called a few minutes later and said they didn't have one of the ingredients and if we could order something else which we did. Both on the online order and over the phone we confirmed no onions. They put onions. We called back they said we will send you a coupon for free pizza for next time. Three weeks later we hadn't received the coupon so we called to see what was going on. As soon as free pizza was mentioned the guy said hold please, stuck me on hold and never came back to the phone. Ridiculous"}
{"text":"Moved here not too long ago.  Was going to order me up some pizza.  After reading all the bad reviews I've decided NOT to order from this location.  Decided to try Dominos although I prefer PJP, at least I did back where I used to live.  PJP, are you listening."}
{"text":"I have stopped using this location and will not be using Papa Johns again. The pizza product itself has been good but the service has always been mediocre. The manager (John) would not come speak to me about one of his delivery drivers nearly hitting me in the parking lot. This has been a problem with this location for as long as I can remember. I have had to jump out of the way of some of their drivers. This has happened to my wife and others as well. One of their drivers hit my neighbors car."}
{"text":"Waited well over an hour. Cold, I mean congealed pizza! Poor delivery guy blamed it on \"new delivery drivers\". Called twice to find pizza. \"Steve\", the manager extremely condescending. Reluctant to reverse charge!  This after asking driver to keep \"pizza\", placed on hold because person who answered didn't know who manager was and didn't understand \"cancel order, we have already waited over an hour and called twice to verify.\" Even asked to pick it up! Never again Papa, never again! Busy, tied up, new, high or dead! Never, ever again!!!!!!!! Would rather go hungry, again, and be charged, again. Either way, same crappy experience, even for basic \"pizza\" delivery. Experience not worth $18.00. Are you kidding me?"}
{"text":"Worst customer service.   Placed an order around 2pm for delivery at 6pm.  At 6:30 pm tried to reach  the store about my order.  The line was busy.  Called the 16th Street location and that manager told me 19th and Northern was overwhelmed and I should receive my order within 30 minutes. At 7:15 I was able to reach the 19th and Northern location and was told they were running behind and I should get my order in a few minutes.  It is 7:30 pm... no order, no phone call, no apology.  I would have made other arrangements if Papa John's let me know they not yet started my order yet."}
{"text":"I try to not give out 2's and 1's for ratings but I really can't stand Pappa Johns..  Do yourself a favor and pay a few bucks more for some good pizza.  If you insist on greasy chain pizza, Hungry Howies is the only choice.."}
{"text":"Big on-line pro-mo.50%off.Try as I might,I couldn't succeed on the web-sight.Finally gave up.I have no problem with pizza hut."}
{"text":"Worst customer service! Do not call for carry out I can't believe they don't deliver to SUNSET & ARROY GRANDE!"}
{"text":"On March 18, 2018 we ordered a Pizza from this location,  I was told that the wait was 225 min.  I offered to come and pick up the pizza,  I get their pick up the pizza,  I wanted to make sure they took the tip and deliver fee off,  they tell me,  O it is free.  I have yet to received a refund,  Called my bank,  they said they have not issued,  On April 1, 2018 my mother did an order for 30 dollars the wait again is 225 min,  we cancelled the order,  have not received a refund.  I called the store she is telling me they did not see anything in the system and they gave the money back,  she told me she is the store owner and there is not boss above her,  My bank says they have not issued the money.  Do not order wait is too long and pay cash if you do,  they steal your money."}
{"text":"Best customer service I have have in a long time attention to details eve they were BC they took care of us I didn't get the name of the gentleman... Friday around 730 if I can give them 10 stars"}
{"text":"The family and I love some pizza. We had Papa John's last night and it was fantastic. We had to large pizzas...one sausage with bacon bits, mushrooms,  olives, and many other things on it.. Um Um Good... The other pizza was sauage and pepperoni. Um Good. The bacon bit pizza was a bit tastier than just sausage and pepperoni. Thanks Papa John's for great pizza."}
{"text":"People who answer the phone hate their life so much it's almost fun to listen to them. The customer service is the absolute worst. Lady picks up the phone and literally says, \"hello what do you want.\" I wish I was lying. Smh it's so difficult to find good customer service nowadays. People if you hate your job, quit."}
{"text":"Haven't ordered from here in a very long time. I understand why I haven't.  Ordered online at 9pm. After order is placed and my card was ran it says it going to be 85-95 mins. Okay so I tell my family and they said okay see if you can cancel the order. I called at 10:45 asked to cancel my order the guy said no mama it's on it was. Sorry we only had on driver tonight. It will be there shortly.  Well about 15 mins later I hear a knock on the door. Pizza is here.....but it's cold and garlic cheese knots were raw in the middle. Horrible!!! Never again"}
{"text":"Always rude, never on time, even though I showed up 30 minutes before they close I guess they were close for carry out again. The Asian kid with the tank top working in the front had the door open but supposedly they were closed. This on top of two years of at least a dozen bad experiences of the employee smoking right by the front door the place full of kids cussing at each other when I'm in there and a few other things I have decided I will never go back to this place and I just emailed their corporate office."}
{"text":"First time ordering from papa johns and ill have to admit I loved it.  I ordered it online and the process was very easy.   The delivery was quick and the driver very polite.  I really enjoyed the pizza.  Will definitely be ordering again."}
{"text":"First I'll say that it doesn't appear as though they care about making things right as their management doesn't reply on Yelp or to complaints via the website so I'll keep this short. Once you pay, they forget that you exist. Then when they've helped every other customer and you check on the status, they cant even find the order in the system. So, pizza (and me) sitting there for 10 minutes getting cold. They don't even 'present' the pizza to me for approval so its not until I get home that I realize its not to order. What a horrible experience!"}
{"text":"I've been ordering pizza from this location for over 2 years now. So this review is a little late in coming, but after the delivery I just received I felt I needed to write one.  I ordered a LG Works pizza, but when it was delivered, it was a thin crust. I've never ordered a thin crust because I'm not a fan. However I didn't want to wait for another pizza, so we just told the driver thank you (we did tell him of the mix up).  About a half an hour later the driver returned with a fresh pizza and no thin crust. Very unexpected, but very appreciated.  This is why Papa John's is my favorite place and will continue to be!"}
{"text":"First of all this location has great customer service and they always make sure your order is correct. The delivery drivers as well are very well mannered & polite.   I am new to the neighborhood and love this Papa johns location ! My boyfriend loves the hot cookie they have to offer, it's to die for !! We recently ordered a hot cookie for pick up today and received AWESOME service from Chance and Manager,Max.   I always recommend Papa Johns to family and friends ! & it's great for Sunday night foot ball games. Go Panthers !"}
{"text":"I received sub par service. My friend got cut off  and rudely spoken to while we were trying to order. All we wanted was a pizza and we have been put on hold for way too long. Don't know what to do....."}
{"text":"Damn good white cheese pizza.   My favorite memory of this place is when my friend Emily and I ate a full white cheese pizza.  In the car. While driving. On the way to our stupid sorority ritual night.  Wearing all white.    We were pigs."}
{"text":"I would advoid this location I had a bad experience ordering over the phone. Once I picked up the pizza and took it home the crust was burnt and the pizza was ice cold.  Just a terrible experience and I will not use this Papa John location in the future."}
{"text":"I ordered a large pepperoni with tomatoes. Was completely covered in toppings. YUM. Also ordered the garlic parmesan breadsticks.  YUM again. Got a 8 piece plain wings with honey mustard sauce. Another YUM. Then dessert of the cinnamon roll stuff. Can't Remember the name. YUM. I couldn't find anything to complain about.  I ordered at 6:39. They said estimate delivery 6:58 to 7:08.  It was delivered at 7:12. And that's with all the construction right out front. I would say that was excellent."}
{"text":"These people can't answer the phone or handle any type of demand spike.  Please just close down and try something else.  If wait times are going to be excessive, you must make your customers aware."}
{"text":"Tried this location a few times since moving to this side of town. Both times the pizza and order were mediocre. Both family and I felt bloated and fighting for a bathroom trip each time. Used to love Papa John's, but this location obviously has no idea how to make consistent food on time, or that is of quality."}
{"text":"We were made to wait outside at 10.20am as Mr. Papa Jones opens at 10.30. We go in again at 10.30am and wait at the counter for 25mins and nobody attends to us! We call the guys crawling in front but they have audacity not to respond, turn their back to us!   This Johnny by name Jonathan comes at takes the order with a grumpy face.Wear some smile dude, after all we pay to buy our pizza from Pappa!  Wish I had a half star option(half for the pizza) to rate for the service!"}
{"text":"Ordered take out today and it came quickly despite the snow! Driver was nice and most importantly the pizzas were hot although we live quite far from this location.   Bottom line: This is our go to pizza restaurant. Pizza is delicious. The meat and cheese tastes real for lack of better words. Each bite is exquisite and just hits the spot. We love the Papa John's pizza (all meat) and the pan pizza. The garlic sauce is amazing too! 2 large pizzas come to around $40 with tips.  So happy they opened a new location that can deliver to our place. Will order again for sure! 100% recommend!"}
{"text":"Worst pizza and service twice I received my pizza not even cooked shredded cheese was  still cold and the guy looked at me crazy when I said it was unexpectable . Very disappointed  Get it together"}
{"text":"I really enjoyed my experience here. It started off where it could have been rocky, but the manager quickly put me at ease. I ordered a pizza and waited on it to be made and it was missing toppings I paid for. After the manager was notified, she offered to make another pizza and even let me keep the other pizza as well. While waiting she grabbed a plate and let me niece have a slice to hold her over. She was very kind, which you don't get at a lot of places anymore."}
{"text":"I ordered two large pizzas, one with extra cheese. The extra cheese pizza did not have any extra cheese.It had the same amount of cheese as the other pizza. I also ordered bread sticks. They were horrible. They were dry and no sauce was included with the sticks. The large pizza was small compared to other large pizzas. I found the pizza very similar to Dominoes but not as good.. I ordered on line for pick up, and they forgot to send me an e-mail to confirm or tell me when my pizza was done, so not only was it bad pizza but it was bad, cold pizza. I called the store and they said, \"Oh yeah, your pizza is sitting here.\"  Where was my e-mail?  \"Oh sometimes that happens, you don't get an e-mail or phone call with a time to pick up your pizza. Did I hear an \"I'm sorry or even a credit to the order?\" Noooo  Really bad customer service.  Not going back!"}
{"text":"I am and will always be a papa johns hater. I'm writing this review because I happened to see one of their lovely delivery drives lack work ethic. I was hanging out at a local vape shop and they had ordered pizza. Delivery dude literally hung out for like 30 mins asking about different mods and looked at juice. I noticed he had another pizza in his bag thing. I would hate to be the receiver of that other pizza. Well if that customer even got it.  If some younger again kid with long light brown hair delivers your pizza good luck to you friend."}
{"text":"I use the online rewards program. Every $5 is a point, and every 25 points is a free large pizza. However if you order $9, it is one point and the $4 does not roll over. Place order online, do whatever you need to so at home, leave in 15-20 min and they have the pizza ready! It's not the most pleasant place to wait for pizza. Small waiting area and hot.   Overall it's fine. Super convenient for mountains edge residents c:"}
{"text":"They are literally always late. I placed my orders with the \"schedule ahead\" feature online and thus they have hours of notice. Still, it comes no less than 30 minutes late. Annoying!"}
{"text":"Ive had good luck with this pizza joint every time I get pizza here. Which is very often. I always get what I order but i do know that if you call and complain about anything their policy is to give you free stuff. This could be easy to exploit. Ive not exploited it but...."}
{"text":"Got to give a shout out to my favorite pizza delivery place. The pizza is good - cooked the way I order and the delivery people are friendly and fun! I order online from this location at least once a month - Great job guys! Thank you!"}
{"text":"Probably the best pizza delivery I've had. Ordered it online, came in probably around a half hour. Delivery girl was above and beyond friendly, gave me some free magnets."}
{"text":"Took over an hour half for a extra large pizza (30 estimated delivery time) and we live 2 miles away, plus the pizza was COLD. Driver arrives and has no information for management. Called to complain and person on the other line SAYS they will send another pizza right away. 40 min later and still no pizza..."}
{"text":"Chicken Alfredo pizza and the honey chipotle wings are great!"}
{"text":"we have given this location a few tries over the years and they never fail to remind us why we dont eat here. pizza is cold ( we live less than 3 mins away) you pay from dbl toppings and got 7 slices of pepperoni on you pizza. always seem to mess up order in one way or another. thank god we got a new pizza joint in the neighbourhood. will NEVER eat here again."}
{"text":"This Papa Johns is the worst they always seem to mess up my order and have to remake a pizza while I'm there. They pizza have to much sauce and a overload of toppings. I order the thin crust pizza and it was nasty. It actually tasted like oven cheese toast.. Crunchy and burned. I wish they would actually start reading their reviews and fix this place."}
{"text":"Don't even waste time at this location. The franchise is amazing but location fails me every time. Refunds don't make up for being constantly let down from the same location. Thanks for forgetting my root bear & the cold pizza!"}
{"text":"I have always liked Papa John's pizza, over the other chain pizza companies. But this particular store gives the chain a very bad name. On 3 occasions now this store has not completed my delivery order correctly. On the last order I paid for 2 extra garlic sauces, $1.20. And of course they were not delivered. When I called the store, the manager on duty was actually mad that I was complaining and told me it only a $1.20. Really!  It might on be $1.20 but to date their small mistakes have cost me about $5.60. Avoid this store! Or at least until they figure out customer service."}
{"text":"Very unhelpful service and pizzas always arrive 20-30 mins after time given on order. Won't be ordering from this location in the future, I called for the status of my order and was really disappointed with my interaction the employee on the phone."}
{"text":"This place needs to add some common sense to their in-store pickup system.  I always order online and prepay.  Their procedure is to have you sign the receipt and hand you your pizza.  The last two visits required me to wait until the cashier finished taking lengthy phone orders.  There is another register, but no one else is apparently allowed to use it.  My visit on Wednesday, 13 December 2017 was ridiculous.  When I walked in, the young woman cashier was on the phone.  After conversing for a while, she announces to the staff that this customer wants to order a pizza without a crust.  Then, a conversation among the staff transpired, while all I needed them to do is hand me my pizza.  Then a really long conversation ensured with the customer.  I finally shouted, \"Can someone just hand me my pizza\"?  A young man responded that I would have to wait for the cashier.  This amounted to a ridiculous and unacceptable wait for her to finalize a weird pizza order.  Why should I have to wait through this?  When I was finally waited on, she handed me a huge black magic marker to sign the small receipt.  The receipt has just a large black blob on it.  To make matters worse, my pizza was not even heat stored; it was merely sitting on a shelf behind the cashier.  When I arrived home, the pizza was barely warm, and the ingredients were skimpy.  PIZZA HUT is about 2 miles down the road, and they have their act together.  I'll be going there in the future."}
{"text":"I used to really like Papa Johns pizza. This particular location is just ok. Its nothing to brag about.  But if you are craving papa johns then here you go.  The pizza here is hit or miss. I've ordered here a few times and sometimes its good and other times its not.  Customer service is just average.  If you're looking for pizza that will blow your mind then try North End Pizza."}
{"text":"I just had a really great experience with this location and their great manager! I had A late meeting and my hungry teenagers needed pizza. They accidentally ordered carry out and really needed pizza delivered The manager of the location noticed that there was a pizza waiting for me and not getting picked up. The kids realized what happened and re-ordered the pizza and the really awesome manager handled everything perfectly. When I called to follow up he knew exactly what had happened and was so gracious and helpful. I buy a lot of pizza at this location and I am so happy to give them a great review.  Good customer service should not go unnoticed."}
{"text":"Stay far away from this location.  The management has a \"we have enough business \" attitude when they screw up.    I spent way too much time waiting for my pick up order that was never made.  (35 minutes)  When it was finally brought to the manager's attention, he did not offer an apology or even to make it.  I finally told him to cancel it. Without ever looking at me, he said \"ok\" and walked away.    I contacted customer support and reported my experience.  I was told someone would be contacting me to follow up.  This email is their entire idea of \"follow up\":  Dear Thomas,  Thank you for taking the time to provide us with your feedback. I would like to apologize to you for the late service that you have recently received.  At Papa John's, we strive for best in class in everything we do.  One of our core values at Papa John's is constant improvement.    We want to make it right. We do not take these issues lightly and your feedback will be used to improve our ability to serve you in the future.  Sincerely,  store 1686         General Manager Round Rock Restaurant Group  I replied to the email and have never heard from them again.  There is way too much competition out there for this place to stay in business.  Help shut them down and show them that people will not accept such horrendous service.    Tom Murphy"}
{"text":"I had the worst experience in this store. I placed a carry out order and I only noticed that it had wrong ingredients when I reached home. I called the store and explained my problem and asked him to replace it with the correct one and he said it would take 35-40 min for delivery and he told me that my order could not be served in priority as I am getting free Pizza( I never asked for free pizza and I don't need one)  and asked me to pick it up if it is priority for me. I had to visit the store twice for no mistake of me , I agree that mistakes do happen at work and is acceptable sometimes but the saddest part is the way the employee talked to the CUSTOMER while he is explaining his problem. I don't need ANYTHING for Free and I pay for my food. I went to pick up my correct order and returned back the wrong one."}
{"text":"After a tough Friday night I found myself at Papa John's ordering the Meats Pizza special for $14. It was a decent Pizza, much better than Pizza 73. The ingredients tasted better and the quality was better overall. It was an ok meal. Might be my standard choice for takeout.  25/30 Yelp 30 Day Challenge"}
{"text":"For the love of god don't bother with this place.   I ordered a pizza online from here, which showed up after an hour. When I opened the box, I saw that it was the wrong pizza (with someone else's name and address on the box). I called and they said they screwed up and would come and swap the pizzas, which they did. They also said they were going to take the wrong pizza and deliver it to the correct house after it had been sitting in my house for 20 minutes. This is a horrible business practice!   I then realized the pizza that I had originally ordered, which now needed to be microwaved, was in fact wrong in the first place. I called and they said they would re-make and re-deliver a new pizza. When they showed up (for the 3rd time now), the pizza was still wrong! They demanded I give them the original wrong, cold pizza, so who knows what they did with that. I gave up and ate my wrong pizza because they kept hanging up on me when I called to complain."}
{"text":"I ordered around 11pm. at 12:17 I called to check on my order and they lied and said they \"tried calling\" and \"couldnt find my house\" when i called them out on it they back tracked and then said they didn't put the order through and they will start it right then. I was hesitant and asked how long it would take and he said \"uh you can canceled the order if you dont want it\" I said no, how much longer? I've already waited more than an hour.\" and he said no more than 30 minutes. it is now 1:25am and i just got a call from Grubhub saying they canceled my order because they \"had no delivery drivers\" I called papa johns multiple times and they put me on hold until who im assuming is a manager answered and was rude and lied about canceling my order. they have a shit CEO and a shit staff."}
{"text":"Absolutely then worst pizza I've ever eaten. Even gave them a second chance several months later. Just as bad. When I emailed the corporate office, they promised to have someone call me. Never happened."}
{"text":"My daughter and I were excited to order pizza tonight but ended with dissatisfaction originally the pizza arrived in poor condition with cheese missing at the crust edges and piled in the center it also was missing the garlic butter I had ordered we called the store and were told they were sending a replacement after an hour and 10 minutes  later we called because it had not arrived they awnsered the phone by saying pizza hut even though it was clearly papa John's we were then told the pizza had left 10 minutes ago it finally arrived after a total of an hour and 20 minutes and this was my remake it looked much better but by this time it was 5 minutes till 10 next time I order it will not be from here as my child and I are now eating at 10 o clock when my original order was put in at 7:59 very dissatisfied with the service and lack of professionalism"}
{"text":"Terrible service horrible delivery and service takes forever for them to deliever and the pizza is always cold and bread sticks are burns and taste like crap if i could give 0 starts i would"}
{"text":"Excellent Pizza , Better than the usual chains pizza pizza, dominos etc..be sure to check out deals on website. I am glad to finally see a Papa Johns in Mississauga!"}
{"text":"I actually wasn't a Papa John's fan until I started eating from here. They are always fast, the food is hot, fresh, and service is great. No complaints here! And they always have great coupons and discounts!"}
{"text":"For cheap pizza with a myriad of online/email specials and LOTS of extra garlic sauce, there's nothing like PapaJohns.  Now I completely understand that this is the McDonalds of Pizza. And once in a while, I'm ok with that. Why not? Everyday can't be gourmet. If it were, then gourmet would lose it's luster.  So if you want a cheap and fun take-home meal that, at least for me, will satisfy a very particular craving, then look no further than PJ's.  I get the two large 3 topping special for 12 bucks. Mine gets mushroom, pepperoni, and spicy Italian sausage. Always free extra sauce, always crispy bake, always original crust, always square cut, always extra Garlic sauce cups. The other is usually a black olive, mushroom and sausage pie, same instructions.  Sign up and online order and get great deals AND start earning points for a free pie. delicious."}
{"text":"oh my gosh literally i ordered pizza twice from this place only because i love papa johns pizza but it literally take like 1 hr and 40 minutes to get here . this happened all the three times i ordered like whats up. either get more staff (since that was the excuse last times) or stop saying 40-50 minutes of wait time and actually put like 2 hrs. i usually dont complain bout waiting but when the problem is low staff i kinda get mad , cuz theres ppl who want a job"}
{"text":"Terrible terrible service. Didn't not say anything when we arrived even though there weren't any other customers in the store. Made us wait for several minutes to be checked out even though our pizza was ready because the employees were talking to each other. They were on their phones and we had to ask for service. Very disappointing service. The first guy who \"helped us\" threw the pizza down and said someone else would help us in a minute. The girl who \"helped\" us after did not greet us at all and just said our total. Will not return."}
{"text":"Absolutely terrible service! The manager basically called my sister a liar when we were trying to make a complaint on an order. Completely disrespectful."}
{"text":"A friend and I decided to order a pizza that was close enough to pick up, to save the delivery charge.  Starving and excited for pizza, we set out to pick up an order we'd placed online.  The first problem wasn't their fault: they appeared  on the NE side of the intersection on my GPS, rather than SE.  As we drove around hoping to stumble upon PJs, I called the store.  Second problem was that phone call.  After I endured a 4 minute spiel from a recording, the call was finally answered just to ask me to \"hold please\".  He did come back and give me better directions, and within 40 seconds we were pulling up to the right parking lot.  The storefront was TINY, I'd never have noticed it if I wasn't looking so hard.  The interaction inside was just kinda strange.  The guy at the counter seemed confused by us wanting to pick up our order, confused that I was trying to also purchase two soft drinks, and confused by the fact that we would be paying in one transaction.  He was totally baffled by the request for extra parmesan packets, and required us to explain twice before he could give us more pepperoncinis.    After all that, the pizza was fantastic.  It could have had something to do with the fact that we were so hungry, but I have zero complaints about the food.  Maybe if we'd chosen delivery been able to avoid the experience with the man in the store, I'd add another star or two."}
{"text":"This is a four-star Papa John's. Order is always hot, ready on time, and completely accurate. Staff is super friendly and upbeat.  Unfortunately, however, this location closed.  Now my closest PJ fix is in Mesa.  They may have a total DB of an owner (the chain...I have no clue about the franchisee) but damn if they don't have yummy pizza with a 50% off online code (ALWAYS).  RIP. You are missed."}
{"text":"I really enjoy Papa John's pizza but this location is the worst. I always have to make sure to add 15 min to the time they said the pizza would be ready. Sometimes the large pizza is $6 and sometimes it is $11. The crust is burnt half of the time. The pizza is sometimes warm and sometimes they give you garlic sauce with your pizza. Every time I order pizza from this place it's always a guessing game on to what will be wrong with the pizza. The management and employees don't seem to have great communication with each other."}
{"text":"Have ordered from here many times. Never had an issue and the pizza is always fantastic. Not sure why all the bad reviews, but wanted to make sure we shared our positive experiences with this location."}
{"text":"DISGUSTING THIEVES! I would give zero stars if I could. On April 19th at 12:24PM I placed an order with this location for delivery. The order was cheese sticks, popcorn chicken, and a side salad. The delivery time was 30-40 minutes. At 1:07PM I received a call from a driver stating he couldn't find my work place, which has a BIG YELLOW sign out front. At 1:13PM he called AGAIN unable to find me. I sit at the front desk, no one was trying to deliver anything. Finally at 1:36PM he arrived, no sorry, nothing, just dropped my food, had me sign and ran out. 32 minutes late!!! I went to eat my salad first, and looking at, and the label they put on it was EXPIRED! I'm 7 months pregnant and there is no way me or anyone else should have to eat an expired meal they paid for! My cheese sticks and my chicken were both COLD, and did not look appetizing. I called right away, the man I spoke to told me 'What do you want me to do? I can't refund you your money.' I told him I wanted my money back. He said he could put a credit on my account so I agreed to that. Today I tried to place an online order through my account since they emailed me a 50% promotion going on right now with online orders. I called to try to use my credit because it wasn't on my account. The female I spoke to couldn't find any record of it, and that she was the only one working that day. No she wasn't because I spoke to a male and my delivery driver was a male. Then she told me to order through her. I asked if I'd still get the discount because I already had my cart made online. She said no I can't use the online order discount and use my credit. It's MY MONEY! You gave me EXPIRED, LATE, and COLD food. She said I'd have to come in to use it and I can't order online or delivery, when the original order they messed up on BIG TIME was online and delivery. Absolutely absurd and poor management! I will take my business elsewhere since they like to give people expired cold food and steal their money."}
{"text":"Really Papa Johns??? This locale is terrible. Ordered pizza online, super simple order for kids 1 topping meds. Delivery took to 110 W Greenway instead of E Greenway. Driver called from literally 30 secs away a half hour later I called store they said driver googles and address was 30 out. So he took back to store and they didn't have any concern about making the order right. Excuse was they were super busy with the complexity of making and delivering pizzas tonight. TOOLS!"}
{"text":"My Husband and I have ordered here several years....not any more.The employees act like they can not read addresses and the food was ice old.Gotta frostbite touching it!!!!!!!!Tried to connect with Manager,says promo code will get this fixed. Not today or even tomorrow.Promo code didn't work.Got duped...again.The Manager called and said she didn't know why the code didn't work......I know why.It was Never activated!!!!!!!!!! Soooooooooooo long Papa John's!!!!!"}
{"text":"Ordered off of papa John's.com and received a call 20 mins later telling me they were having technical difficulties. (What does that even mean?)they could not tell me what the issue was and they asked if I wanted to submit a complaint. How does submitting a complaint help feed my guests. I was told a supervisor would call me back in 15 mins and I have received no call.  Papa John's lost a customer for life go Pizza Hut!!!"}
{"text":"Papa John's is always a great tasting pie; however, they're still very reserved on the toppings compared to their competitors.  A little more generosity would bring them up to 5 stars, for me."}
{"text":"We order from a pizza from a location in Concord NC 3805 Concord Parkway S  Tonight 1 large meatlovers after celebrating our wedding anniversary  The pizza was not completely done and tasted terrible the worst I ever had . We call this location to complain and request another pizza The manager stated The order  of dough they received in has a known issue of not proofing correctly  And if he sent another pizza it would be the same issue with the pizza So we requested a refund What poor service and I will not order pizza from Papa Johns ever again"}
{"text":"Valentina's Day promotion: heart-shaped pizza.   Valentine's Day pizza picked up: wrong crust, lukewarm. Very NOT heart-shaped.   Think you can romance a lady with a cheesy (HA!) V-Day treat? NOPE.   Thanks for the blue balls, PJ's."}
{"text":"If I could give a zero star review I would because 1 star is too high for the experience we just had with the 13370 W Van Buren location. At around 10:17pm on Thursday, March 8th I ordered a large half cheese half pepperoni pizza from the Papa John's on 13370 West Van Buren location in Goodyear, AZ to be delivered to my hotel. After about 45 minutes, the pizza had not arrived but it said online it was delivered. After calling the store and talking to a man there he said that \"his driver was unable to get into the hotel\" and \"she tried calling the number on our account\" (which never happened as I never received a call) and she drove back with our pizza because she was unable to get in. We asked the lobby if anyone from papa johns was seen there or came through the front as the doors are open to the public and they said no one had come through. The time was only 11:03pm and so I asked the man on the phone what we could do and he said they were closed and he voided our order. I asked if I could come and pick it up as our hotel is only 3 minutes away and he said he's closed, the pizza is cold, and the till was closed so there would be no way to ring it up. He very rudely hung up and when my wife tried to call back to tell him he had horrible customer service and ask for his name and corporates number he hung up on her and said they are closed. She tried calling back again and the same man answered and said we are closed and hung up.  On additional attempts to call he ignored the call altogether. We have been long time Papa John's customers but with this horrible experience we will no longer be ordering from Papa John's again. This is the WORST customer experience we have ever received and this man needs to no longer work for papa johns as he has NO customer service skills."}
{"text":"Neighborhood delivery and takeout great....certainly a step higher than the other chains in this level. They don't biast 30"}
{"text":"I have eaten at multiple papa johns in this area and I would say this is the better one. I went to this location and it was not too busy. The wait was not too long and pizza was flavorful.  I would be back."}
{"text":"The best of all the pizza chains.  I have a confession to make, I just recently started actually getting into pizza. Before I reached 16, the only pizzas I ever ate were from chains, restaurants/buffets that don't specialize in it and frozen.   Although I am seeking to expand my pizza horizons, I still love my Papa John's. I haven't had it in a while though, money is tight, Pizza Hut has that $10 deal and a Little Caesars is practically next door to where I live.(I love pizza regardless, but still...)  The sauce is always bursting with flavor, the toppings are awesome(I love their Italian meat pizzas so much) and they ALWAYS give you garlic sauce. Also, the breadsticks are to die for.  I may become a total pizza snob one day, but I'll never have too sophisticated a palate to enjoy a slice from Papa John's."}
{"text":"They are pretty quick to get your order ready.  I like that I can order online and it's ready when I get there.  They haven't messed a pizza up for me yet.  They have good promo codes almost all the time."}
{"text":"This papa johns is the worst. We have had so many issues with this store from them 'not receiving an order' to them not knowing what extra cheese means - it's such a joke. Go elsewhere for your own sake."}
{"text":"This place sucks ass supposedly the fucking manager is a douchebag he can't deliver pizzas across the street because he doesn't know the address do not order from this place again"}
{"text":"Such bad service. Manager was no help either. Messed up order and delivered late also. Forgot to bring the dipping sauces for breadsticks. Will never order from here again. Sticking with Dominos or PizzaHut instead of PapaJohns"}
{"text":"Amazing customer service!  Picked up our pizza at their location and employees were very polite and professional which goes a long way these days.  And pizza was delish as always! Will come to this location again."}
{"text":"We ordered from this location for the first time, and our pizza was terrible.  We ordered it well done for the first time, and it came super burnt with the crust inedible.  We called and told them about our pizza, and their remark was that's how it's supposed to be.  We explained it wasn't just well done but burnt, and their customer service was terrible- no offer to send a new Pizza.  We will not order again from this location."}
{"text":"Been going to this location for a year or so. I normally order online and go and pick up myself within the 15-25 minute time they ask for. Good pizza at a good price especially when they have the 50% off coupons for the coyotes or the dbacks winning a game"}
{"text":"I've been to better papa john's before. The pizza today had it not been in a papa john's box with the typical pepper and garlic sauce, I would of thought it was a very cheap pizza frozen-prepared. The chicken was not fresh, and the overall taste was not like I've enjoyed from papa john's at other places."}
{"text":"This location is exceptional! We placed an order for take out and picked our pizzas up at the designated time. We didn't have to wait at all and our order was correct. The man at the counter even threw in some Parmesan cheese and red pepper flakes for free which they usually cost. The pizzas were great and we were very satisfied with the location. I definitely will come back for the excellent service!"}
{"text":"Two orders in the last few weeks - Abysmal each time.   March 28th: Placed an online order about four hours in advance, to be delivered that day at 6PM. Pizza wasn't delivered until after 6:30, driver said \"Sorry, your place is hard to find.\" I didn't make anything of it, thought it was a one-off thing.   April 4th: Place an online order 3 hours in advance, again, to be delivered at 6PM. Around 6:30 I called the store to complain and spoke with David (from reading the reviews, might be the manager)? He gave a half-hearted \"Sorry\" and said they experienced a rush and it should be there within the next five minutes. Almost 30 minutes later, as I'm getting ready to call again, the pizza guy shows up and was friendly - a little too friendly considering the pizza was an hour late at this point.   So, 'nuff said - I realize my problem is insignificant in your busy pizza world, but please, if I place an online order three or four hours in advance, why should this be affected by \"the rush?\" Probably going to switch to a rival pizza chain from now on."}
{"text":"Told my order would be ready 16-26 minutes. I show up 30 minutes later to be told that my order was still on the make line and not ready. The employees seem to be more worried with talking to one another than making pizzas or customer service. Love watching the female in a black shirt stop making pizza to text on her cell phone."}
{"text":"Since we are new to Charlotte,  we have heard good things about Fuel and have been disappointed every single time. Finally caved and got the ol standby and was pleased by the speedy delivery, the ability to add a tip ahead of time to the online order and the pizza itself. Not wet!  I hate soggy and this was far from it. Plenty of toppings that were all correct and had a really yummy smoky flavor. Thank you Papa!!"}
{"text":"I always thought customer service was a hallmark of Papa Johns.  Not any more.... I ordered a pepperoni pizza online.  I already had an online account and have ordered from this venue prior.  When I got the pizza home, no pepperoni. I called the store and was put on hold for almost 12 minutes!  No exaggeration, my phone logged 13:24 on the call.  I was then told that placing the order online, something must have happened and the online app failed to put pepperoni on the order and there was nothing they could do.  Sorry... Well, I'm sorry too and hope other people don't make the mistake of ordering from this place!"}
{"text":"Kudos to Valerie and the team. Speedy service, hot pizza, offer of crushed red pepper. All given with a smile and friendly attitude."}

{"text":"It's not an eat~in or drive~thru place, but u can pick~up ur order(s) & of course the Delivery they're known 4. Must admit, MANY years ago we also were 1 of those who placed an online order & went 2 pick it up, only 2 b told there was no order but... they r a Drastically Improved & a Completely Reliable place now!     It makes all the difference when u hire actual 'WORKers' or perhaps it was a combin8ion of such + internet issues on their end BACK Then, being the place was fairly new. Whatever the case WAS, it's like a completely new/different place now that's back in our good graces, having earned back our business (which btw is no small feat/nearly impossible once having lost it) which in & of itself speaks volumes!!     Tend 2 do more Pick~Up than Delivery these days but either way, the front counter & behind the scenes staff & drivers have been courteous, prompt & always have our orders Correct, hot, & freshly made (can always tell). We've been REALLY impressed on more than a few occasions where it defin8ly went beyond the usual Amazing service we have been accustomed 2/come 2 expect.      Their rewards program is an Awesome concept where u gain points every time u purchase (think it's 1 point for every $5 spent) & once u accumul8 25 u get a FREE Large pizza w/ up to 3 toppings, so how kewl is that? Our fave is the Spinach Alfredo Specialty Pizza & they've just come out w/ a new Greek Pizza that we're gonna have 2 try (which we'd customize w/o meats). Pretty Good desserts 2!     Over the passing years we've used them countless Xs & they will continue 2 get our business whenever we need a quick~fix, haven't made it 2 the grocery store/don't feel like cooking when I/they get home from work, or just in the mood (as was the case just lastnight in fact) Hee~hee! Keep up the gr8 work PJ's, U've come a Long Way which Really Shows & it's Gr8ly Appreci8ed..."}
{"text":"Order here a couple of times already pretty good pizza. I mean for a Americanized Italian pizza. No problems like I've seen on the other reviews. Took a pic of half the pizza with the box. And there wasn't extreme grease on it. But other than that Papa Johns is great for a fast to eat pizza especially for game days!"}
{"text":"From this Papa John's I had the chicken and canadian bacon with a regular crust. I thought that the regular crust was pretty thick. I was only able to eat one slice. I think I like the thin crust better than the regular crust. They were fast in making the order. I ordered from home and drove there right away. By the time I got to the restaurant, the order was waiting for me."}
{"text":"We had a thin crust pizza with chicken and pineapple toppings. I thought that was a Hawaiian pizza, but a Hawaiian pizza is canadian bacon and pineapple. The crust was very thin and crispy, but also had a tender layer, just like I like it. Since the pizza was so thin, I was able to eat three slices, when normally I might only eat one slice. The pizza crust was a bit sweet and had a unique flavor to it. The pizza was made very quickly, I was able to order it from home and drive directly to the restaurant. By the time I got there the pizza was almost done."}
{"text":"Courtney Cain is such a hard worker and works the phones great. She is very sweet and a great listener. She asked me how I was doing and was being like a normal everyday person and i appreciate that. Pizza was amazing. Someone give Courtney a raise!!"}
{"text":"We are new to the neighborhood, busy unpacking our new house and not in the mood to cook. We placed our order online, but noticed that since our house was so new the exact location was not correct.   I contacted the store right away to inform them of this. There was some miscommunication at first. We were originally told that if our address was not pulling up that they would not deliver to us. When I asked to speak to the Manger, Terri got on the phone to make things right. She took down the directions and had the pizza out to us in no time.   The Driver/Deliver Gentleman was very professional and apologetic about the original miscommunication.  I would recommend this papa johns location and would order from them again.  Thanks!  12/05 - I ordered online for take out. The guy at the front was very nice and was able to get my coupon to work."}
{"text":"Can you say TERRIBLE CUSTOMER SERVICE? ok all together now 1.2.3!   They place you on hold for over 5 minutes and are very rude! I called to ask them about a order I placed online and apparently it doesn't matter that I click on future order, it still went through and they made it early. When u explained my situation, the lady on he phone was very rude. I would not recommend this location to anyone. They need to hire new people that have customer service skills. Right as it stands their workers suck! Learn some manners!   Although they cancelled my order I'm afraid that they might just leave the pizzas in the oven and when I pick it up in 4 hours it will be the same one they just finished baking now. No thank you!"}
{"text":"Worst manager and worker on May 21st 2016!!   This is a customer service business, and denying customers the chance to order from their first choice is bad business. The door clearly stated the closing time as 12am but when we arrived at 10:30pm, a young worker with brunette hair ran to the door and locked it in our face without saying a word, she then turned and snickered at another employee. We then decided to call thinking they were doing delivery only, (even then she could've said that to us at the door) but we were hung up on when she was taking our order.   The hotel we were staying at has promotions of Papa Johns in the rooms but with enough complaints I'm sure they can change that since no one wants to be affiliated with poor reviews. I understand you have a life outside of your work, but you are on the clock and you are there as the face of Papa Johns.   Bad service and bad business, this definitely could've been handled better by the workers..but then again it's just papa johns..what really irks me is lazy employees, especially when they think they need a raise but don't have the basic skill or ability to run a business.   BTW: We went to Hungry Howies and they had our order ready to go in 20 minutes:)"}
{"text":"i love this papa johns store!! man i love pizza, if anything can make me break my diet then its papa johns!!!! people who complain about the price is because their not signed up for the deals, whenever i get that 50% off promo code you better bet im ordering pizza!!! THANK YOU PAPA JOHNS FOR THE GREAT PIZZA KEEP UP THE HARD WORK!!!!!!!!!!!! LOYAL COSTUMER!!!!!"}
{"text":"I realize this is a pizza chain but that doesn't make up for the substandard service.  I ordered about a week ago for delivery.  The person on the phone wasn't sure what the specials were when I asked.  After getting the specials, I placed an order for a 14\" pepperoni and some hot wings.  When the pizza arrived (after an hour when I was told 35-45 minutes), the driver was less than cordial.  He handed me the pizza and mumbled the price.  After bringing the pizza inside and opening the box, the pizza was cold, as were the wings.  Since I was hungry, I didn't want to call back and have to deal with the phone person again.  I sucked it up and ate 2 pieces of pizza and 4 wings.  The pizza was flavorless and the crust tasted like cardboard.  The wings were slimy and chewy.  Needless to say, I will never go back to Papa John's again.  I'm going to stick with the local pizzeria Danny's Pizza down the street."}
{"text":"Awful service and quality. After ordering a pizza & them promising a 30-40 minute guarantee. The driver shows up an hour & 15 minutes later with a cold pizza. The manager offers to send out a new 1 hot to replace & he doesn't even get the order right and the pizza wasn't even cut!!!"}
{"text":"Remember to check for coupons around the house! Also, for some reason calling in an order for a pepperoni pizza and picking it up is more expensive than ordering it online and picking up... really?"}
{"text":"Do not buy from this location, the pizza is atrocious they are just a bunch of kids and do not take their job seriously.  Order a pizza with light sauce it comes with no sauce or an over abundance of sauce.  No consistency and terrible quality, avoid the sausage if you do buy from this place or take the chance of major stomach issues.   We love Papa Johns pizza when it is made by someone who cares but not from this location.  Looks like we will be buying from Domino's again for pizza delivery."}
{"text":"Everytime I am in the Ranch Circle Plaza- I am fearful of the Papa John's drivers. They are always so reckless, blasting their music while driving, and driving like bats out of hell through the parking lot."}
{"text":"i was ordering delivery online 7/13 at 18:00 on my app in my phone. i'm putting my order in, and when it's time for me to check out i put my promo code:giveme50. it didnt work. prices are still in full price, so i had to redo it again. this time i put the promo first then it opened a window. the pizzas that i wanted to order weren't there. i needed 2 pepperoni,1 veggie and 1 hawaiian, so i have to manually put it in ...customize the pizza and put the toppings one by one. i have to order 4 pizzas so one by one i have to add the promo then customize the pizza. i did the process on all 4 pizzas. then everything is all half price. at last im done. finishing up im ready to place my order..but then the application stopped working. Now I'm frustrated because i have to do it all over again. after doing the process all over again, i placed my order. i needed to call them because i needed the pizza at much later time (20:45) so, when i called, the guy was very nice \"but\" when he said that the place where i wanted them to deliver was not in their delivery area, (im still calm but mad becuse i always call this branch whenever me and my coworkers wants to have pizza) he said i have to call this place (papa john at pecos) because they are the ones who cover our location. i said ok. he gave me the number. he canceled my order on their branch and forwarded it to the other branch. so, i called the branch at pecos and told them everything - that my order has been transferred to them. he asked me the place where they will deliver and they said that it is not in their delivery area. when i heard that i flared up .  i'm being tossed between these 2 branches of papa john's. i told the guy from pecos to let me talk to the manager. i waited.... but the line was cut off. i called back the desert inn branch. the guy answered but he put me on hold. i hung up and called again and asked for the manager. the lady answered and i told her everything. she said that whenever they put the place where i want them to deliver, they said the computer is telling them its not in their delivery area. i told her that this is not the first time i ordered for delivery. its the same place...twice or 3x i ordered and they deliver it with no problem. now im having these issues. she told me they can still put my order but i would have to pick it up there. i told her i cant; i want it delivered. she keeps telling me they really cant deliver it and........she keeps on talking. i got tired of it and told her that this is the last time that im gonna talk to them... no more papa john's"}
{"text":"Umm so we got light sauce or I mean no sauce on our specialty buffalo ranch chicken. There was no sauce....no tomato or ranch just a couple chicken nuggets on a large pizza. My husband called and complained and the 19 year old manager puffed up on him. The kid said he made the pizza and there was sauce. I beg to differ. The manager said I will get a refund. We will see."}
{"text":"I literally called the store because the hours aren't posted on yelp. The guy answers and says \"Thanks for calling, were closed\" and hung up. As if there's not a nicer way to say that or just maybe not answer..."}
{"text":"Placed a large order here to feed some hungry airmen/women and had no complaints. The order was accurate and each pizza had the normal amount of toppings (sometimes you'll get shorted on cheese, sauce, etc when ordering multiple pizzas. Which didn't happen here).  If you're ever on Nellis AFB and want pizza check them out!"}
{"text":"I wish I would of came on here before going to this location. Rude employee definitely will not be back and will even think twice about going to a papa johns after this experience theres lots of other places where they value their customers!"}
{"text":"I like papa Johns pizza,  my choice is the garden fresh thin crust.  The only thing I can say that was a negative  about this location is the phone system at times is not clear enough for the counter person to hear my order.  Its a bit annoying,  but it could be worse I guess."}
{"text":"The first time or two I ordered from this place it seemed decent, but it seems the more I order and the better the deal is the worse the pizza is. Got an email for a free pizza if I ordered online. Ordered it it was 2.35 for delivery tossed the guy 5 bucks as it took over an hour for it to get here and email said 30-40 minutes. Pizza was cold called and complained and they gave me a voucher for a free pizza. Ordered that today. Came in 35minutes actually this time and was hot. Unfortunately had multiple black hairs all over the pizza. I called and explained it was not about free pizzas we just wanted decent food. If they don't want you to get free pizza don't offer it then. It seems like it's done whenever we get the 2 3 topping deal, but you redeem a free pizza or a promo code for one and you get garbage. I am unsubscribing from their email list and deleting my account to no longer be tempted by their deals... Also you can't rate 0 stars so that's why they got a 1 star."}
{"text":"Told me 20 minutes for pick up its been over 35 no pizza then they tell me it'll be done in a few. Only to comeback n say someone else took it. .. didn't  compensate me for my time wasted on their fuck up or anything ... never again complete waste of time which is something I cannot get back"}
{"text":"Negative review. Ordered a pizza over an hour ago when they told me it would be 40 mins. I called twice asking where it was. The second time I spoke to the manager named Barbara who answered the phone saying \"this is the manager\" she had zero customer service. I didn't want anything for free I just wanted to know where our pizza was and why it took an hour to make a pizza and drive 2 blocks. She was so rude, zero personality and probably the worst customer service ever."}
{"text":"I truly love Papa John's pizza but every time there has been a problem with our orders from different locations  I've ordered online every time, so the  first time I ordered  and there was a problem they said  That I put the order in too early and it takes a while for the system to process the orders, and that they hadn't gotten it and that the first thing they do is fill their big orders and then they look at the online orders, I put the order early so I made sure they would deliver it on time since it was for our break time at work. If it wasn't for me calling them right when they opened just to confirm they got my order We would have never gotten it, so I had to give them to my order over the phone again. We received it, but it was late. The following time I did the same thing as last when ordering it, I also put in The special instruction slot how to specifically get to our location,again they said that they had no order in their system, it took them about 15 minutes to find it, Apparently the order was sent to another location and again it was not on time, it came about  1 hour later and the driver was completely lost and I was trying to give him directions on how to get here, poor thing didn't even speak the language, which made it even harder cause I had to explain it over and over again which took another 20 minutes, finally we got our pizzas they were all cold and we lost our  lunch time  break for the day waiting for them so we didn't even get to have the pizza until the next day. I decided to give them one  more try, this time I ordered from home online again I was very specific in my order what I wanted on it and the time I wanted it for and where I wanted delivered to (I ordered it 1 1/2 hours earlier) well I didn't get it at that time so 1/2 hour had passed from time it was supposed to be here so I called and they said there was a mix up and that they had to redo the order but that the driver should be at my home any minute, another 45 passed and no pizza, so my husband called and asked to talk to the manager, explained the situation, manager said that the order in his screen showed it had been completed and delivered already, ( which it hadn't) but he was very nice and apologized, asked if we still wanted the pizza it would be here in 30 minutes, we were hungry so we said yes that was fine, but as much as I love Papa John's pizza, never again will I order from them. It's too much of a hassle I switched to Pizza Hut, and haven't any problems, they are always on time especially when we order from work , it's easy to order and they're pizzas have been hot and fresh every time."}
{"text":"Bomb.com !! answered phone fast told me 20 minutes got there 5 minutes early ready when I walked in all greated me nicely, and had a chat to thank the customer as they walk out the door. Will come to this location more often"}
{"text":"Never wanted to give a single star. Horrible service 2hrs 15 mins, not delivered when i am writing this review."}
{"text":"tasty pizza that gets there fast. I like the meats,and johns favorite."}
{"text":"Ordered 2 pizzas which arrived late the box that the pepperoni and bacon was in when i went to pick up a slice box was soaked in grease . It went down well though i must say so no real complaint on the food .... allow me to rewind i showed up to the door only to be rejected by someone at the register saying \"were closed, doors only open because the delivery truck is here \" i thought to myself at 10pm?!? only to visit my friend who regularly orders from this location and he goes on to tell me that they only do delivery after a certain time . im just wondering why i had to get that from a non employee instead of the individual at the register who just stated they were closed"}
{"text":"Do not order from here. After waiting over an hour and 45 minutes for my order I called the store and asked what was going on. 1. I was told my order was given to a store across town. Then when I asked to speak to the manager he told he changed it to a carry out order. When I asked him why I was not called he got very rude and started getting upset saying it was my fault. I asked for his District managers number and he refused and hung up on me. I did manage to get it, and will also be contacting him as well."}
{"text":"Two stars because it's papa johns and the food is what it is. However this location isn't the best. The pizza is NEVER warm from here. It doesn't matter if it's delivery, carry out, summer, winter. It always needs to be reheated. I've gotten hot pizza from other papa John's locations, so obviously hot food is possible, just not from this location."}
{"text":"Ive been getting pizza from this location periodically for the past 2 years. Both pickup and delivery. I wont tell you its perfect, buts its been solid every time. Wait times are usually shorter than anticipated, the store is clean, service is friendly and succinct (Im not looking for new pals, just get me the goods), and the pizza is tasty and inexpensive. Also, the drivers can find my apt, which is a nice bonus.   Papa Johns gives a pepper, some red pepper packets and a buttery dipping sauce with each pizza. If you are expecting a trendy or posh experience this isnt for you. Papa Johns is for when you want to sit on the couch and watch a movie after a long day of hard work and American pride."}
{"text":"Last few times were ordered online and picked up in person 10-20 minutes later. Quick service. Pizza was hot. Decent amount of toppings. Can't really complain much (esp if most recent one was free due to T-Mobile Tuesdays). Comes with 1 pepper and 1 garlic butter. Garlic butter consistency varies. Had it completely liquid before. Was solidified this time."}
{"text":"I order for Papa Johns all too frequently, and am almost always greeted by friendly delivery staff in less than my quoted time. If you use the PJ app or order online you can earn points towards free pizza. Got to love that!"}
{"text":"$39.00 for two medium pizzas and an order of breadsticks. I'll save that money for a weeks worth of Pizza Hut next time."}
{"text":"Ran out off pepperoni! Placed an online order for carry out. Had to wait 25 minutes after expected pickup time... No kind of discount or compensation for wasting my time. Way to do business!"}
{"text":"Always Good Pizza!  Love their crust and the peppers with the pizza.  Garlic sauce is always good for dipping.  My wife loves the wings."}
{"text":"Never again - should have listened to the yelp reviews. It took 1.5 hours to deliver 2 cheese and one pepperoni pizza at lunch time ordered at 11 arrived at 1230. I called to ask where it was , put on hold for 5min.. called on another line to tell them not to put me on hold again -I hope this place gets shut down"}
{"text":"was very unhappy with the service tonite for the first time. pizza is almost always here within 30-35 min. the confirmation email said 45-55 min so i figured they were busy. it took just about an hour and a half. after an hour and a few min i called. they said that they were very busy and were looking at a 2 hour delivery time! i asked them why the email didnt reflect that and he couldnt give me an answer. 2 hours for a pizza?? if i had known thru the email i would have canceled and gone somewhere else. very disappointed. the email time should at least be close. pizza was great. service was not. i thought too that they would at least give us a coupon for something more but not even that. not even an i'm sorry for the delay."}
{"text":"Kids school lunch on sidewalk wtf are you thinking don't let your kids eat This pizza how could u papa John's employees I'm so disgusted"}
{"text":"WORST PAPA JOHNS EVER. If you order online, don't expect to actually get your pizza. It's happened to me two times now and they still charged my card. It's ridiculous. All they do is make up excuses and never actually deliver your food."}
{"text":"Great service, friendly driver, quick, came as ordered, same quality ingredients I've come to expect from papa johns anywhere else."}
{"text":"My husband and I ordered online a few times. The last 3 times our order was screwed up. First time we got the wrong pizza then the next 2 times we had missing items. I can understand the first time. Second? OK it's fine, but third time, that's a management problem. We called and the manager and she said she would send a coupon for a free pizza. I don't care about the free pizza, it's the fact that they said they would do something and nothing happened. Never going back. We will spend more money on better quality pizza. I recommend Rosati's Pizza."}
{"text":"Honestly still my favorite pizza since college.  Classic, consistent, you can't go wrong!!"}
{"text":"This place doesn't even deserve a star. We called and placed an order at 5:22p. The guy said, \"it would be ready in 30 minutes\". Our pizza didn't leave until 6:01p, & didn't arrive until 6:35p. it took OVER AN HOUR. When we called to complain to the manager, CHANCE, he was super unprofessional and even hung up on us when we asked for the GM's number. It's super sad that their pizza is decent, but they need to train their employees and managers to have better customer service skills. Definitely not placing an order with this location ever again"}
{"text":"Waited over two hours for a pizza when they gave me an estimated delivery time of 30 minutes. The store did not pick up the phone when I called to inquire about my order. I had to call an 800 corporate customer service line to get anything done about a refund. This store is an absolute disgrace."}
{"text":"Not coming back here! Girl on phone was rude, I was overcharged, they forgot my ranch and messed up my order and their wings tasted horrible! Avoid at all costs!"}
{"text":"Fast and efficient.  Picked up in 20 minutes  after order. Pickup took 20 seconds. Great service."}
{"text":"Placing a delivery order over the phone with the employee at this location was like pulling teeth. There was no prompting on their behalf when it came to asking about payment information. It was too difficult for them to take down simple information. Im absolutely astounded they can even run anything."}
{"text":"Very immature manager I can that for sure. Walk in ask to go lite on pepperoni the whole time I waiting here he keeps saying I never heard of somebody order light anything . I was about to say something to his face but it wasn't worth it . That's why you work at a papa johns lol.  won't be coming back to this location anymore . Staff and managers are douchbags ."}
{"text":"First time here and wasn't bad. Got the special $10 pan pizza with thee toppings: pepperoni, spicy italian sausage, and sausage (what can I say, I'm a carnivore!). Also got the cookie thing for $6.  The pizza was good. I'd def eat it again. Just enough for two adults. But not for 3. Not even if the 3rd is a child. It is only enough for 2. The cookie was too sweet, too small, too thin. Never get this. A waste of money completely.  But the pizza, winner!"}
{"text":"Fast? What?   I don't remember ever having to wait over an hour for 2 pizzas in any pizza place. This location needs to get their business together because this was the most ridiculous wait I didn't know I'd be stuck in. If you tell a customer 30 minutes, I don't expect an hour wait. What a waste of my time and money honestly.   It took one of their employees to notice how long I've been sitting there to ask for my name in order to hand me my already cold order. What a shame. At least he noticed.  I don't recommend you to do any kind of carry out order at this location, or even delivery considering how long they took to prepare a small order for me. Inept and incompetent is not my kind of business to support."}
{"text":"Papa johns is normally great!!! But I have found the exception! This location gave me a dry and over cooked pizza, and when my mother approached the person and they said it was up to their spec! Their spec= crap quality!  I will never go to this location against, for being a new location with a 1 star rating, says it all!  Papa Johns,  do yourself a favor and hire new management and redevelop this store, because right now it's crap!!!!! Literally!"}
{"text":"I choose to go to the Middleton location because their staff in the McKee Madison location is terrible. They mixed my order not once or twice but THREE times ( all in one night) and once I finally got my food it was cold. I get it, ok, it happens or it could be simply just a bad night? I'm not sure but The employees were unapologetic and the delivery driver treated me like I was the problem."}
{"text":"This is the worst papa johns establishment you could ever order from. They always have some kind of issue and cant their stuff straight. I even started doing carry out orders because there is always some kind of issue with delivery. If you think this will save you hassle I promise you that all you have is an even bigger headache. more then once when I did carry out they told me it was not ready and would let me know when it was done. seeing pizzas on the shelf I question in my mind if its mine"}
{"text":"My review is the only one you should listen to, everyone else was probably complicated to the employees (if there was a bad review). Let me tell you that they've never messed up any order of mine and the pizzas are always ready ridiculously fast. The pizzas themselves are absolute gas, they're so delicious. The employees are super chill and it's close to my house. They always have great deals so it's a win win situation for everybody. This papa johns is amazing, don't let anyone tell you otherwise."}
{"text":"The store on Alma School and Chandler Heights Rd is a great place to get a pizza. The staff is always friendly and accurate in telling you when your pizza will be ready and the prices are right. The pizza isn't the best, but then I'm unfairly comparing them to an Italian family owned pizza shop on the East Coast.  You'll not get that good of a pizza here in Phoenix despite what people here say but this is as good as you'll get here."}
{"text":"The  pizza was great! The service from Chris the manager was rude. I walk in and he yells pick up or order in a very abrupt way needs some training, in customer service how about hi can I take your order? Or smile and thank you, he also needs some training in how to treat employees they walk in the door don't forget to wear towel corporate is in town! It was 19.00 for a large pizza very pricey! Asked about coupons he said no! I just threw out 5,000 coupons we don't offer them"}
{"text":"Just ordered Papa Johns tonight for dinner had a really good deal Was not worth it. One of the worse Pizza chains I have ever encountered and worse customer service I order the pizza a little before 6:30 and got it around a little before 8:30pm. I had no choice but to call and ask where my pizza was and all, All this is time I start to ask my self while waiting if he should of ever gotten a tip or not.      I would not recommend ordering pizza from this location for delivery unless you pick it up as a carry out."}
{"text":"Terrible customer service, their special on line price is not recognized when you call in for an order. She told me to hang up & order my pizza on line!  She was borderline rude, not readily offering any specials, mumbled the total cost. The best part? The pizzas were burned! Grrrr! Time to return to Pizza Hut. At least they thank you for calling!"}
{"text":"Order a pizza on the phone, it tooked them 1 hour 45 minutes  for delivery. Never again coming back to this store and buy pizza rude lady manager."}
{"text":"We ordered delivery online at 10p. At midnight we attempted to contact Papa Johns to find out what was taking so long. The phone rang unanswered for 3 minutes the first time and then I called back and let it ring for 5 minutes straight, again without answer. The pizza finally arrived at 1210 and it was cold. The delivery driver claimed that the manager/owner sends everyone home at 8 leaving the restaurant understaffed. Completely disappointed and I will never order from here again. If yell have the option for negative stars, this place would get them!"}
{"text":"It's cheap pizza, what can you say. Nothing to write home about. I miss Gheppetos back home. PJ is like dominoes or Pizza Hut. Nothing to great. The bread sticks were pretty good though. Nice and soft."}
{"text":"My  first experience with Papa John's on Olive was a very pleasant one. I ordered from the online menu placed  the order online and it arrived very timely and correctly. The second time I ordered, their website would not work. Finally I had to call them and  place the order by phone. The order arrived and I discovered that the pizza was not what I had ordered so I called them up and told them about the mistake and again repeated to them what I wanted and they brought me back another Pizza... also incorrect.   By this time I am so hungry I ate the pizza  anyway. I called and talked to the manager Marissa and she said there was a miscommunication. I would like to know how do you confuse the word chicken with the word ham. Anyway I took the five stars away and replaced it with 3.  Doubt that I will be ordering from them again."}
{"text":"Yum a licious!!   Freaking good pizza!!! Thin crust extra cheese!! Mmm!  I'm not sure how this place for such bad reviews, the pizza came out perfect!!!!"}
{"text":"I had been ordering pizza there for years.  Service: 2 star (that's because the guys making pizza are nice.) Attitude: 1/2 star  Pizza: 4 star  Store front: 4 Star  I have asked them not to give me the standard garlic sauce. I prefer marinara sauce or even just any other.  If you don't check it you don't get it. The order taker lady also gives kind of attitude as well. I have gotten wrong orders as well from this store and the lady that takes the order will argue with you that you made that order.  What a shame cause they have great tasting pizza but this piazza chain don't know how to train the front line customer service. I wonder if the food chain owner or manager ever read this? Papa John's need to really put together a front end staff customer service training cause it the front line that helps your business to grow."}
{"text":"So confused. Ordered a pizza for delivery. Upon receipt, we asked for some red pepper and Parmesan. The driver said \"We charge for that, so I'm not allowed to carry any.\"  Figuring he just didn't want to accommodate our request, I called the store. My conversation was less than 30 seconds. It started with a confirmation that they DO charge for these little packets (which everyone gives for free when you order a $25 pizza...or a $10 pizza). Then stating they charge  $0.60/packet, then dropped to $0.10/packet...to free on the occasional carry out. Huh???? This isn't even an option for purchase on their iPhone app (nor should it be in my opinion, but that's besides the point). I have struggled to order from from Papa John's for various reasons, but now charging for the little, itty bitty, tiny, can't possibly cost you as a corporation more than a penny, packets is ridiculous!"}
{"text":"I live super close and frequent this location when in the need of a quick carry out pizza. I've never had a bad experience and my order is always prepared quickly and accurately. Delicious!"}
{"text":"I see why they have all the bad reviews now. Pizza took way more than an hour. Arrived with different drinks than what I ordered bc they were out of what I ordered. Then the topper, the pizza was barely cooked. I can see this is a trend for this location after reading the reviews. At least they refunded my money. Doesn't help my hunger though. I'll try the 3rd Ave and Thomas store instead next time."}
{"text":"Ill start by saying that I made a yelp account just to post this review as a warning to anyone who might try to order pizza from this terrible location. I have had many poor experiences at this location, most of them fairly irritating- from showing up for a takeout order only to be told one of the delivery drivers took them with him and I had to wait- and the frequently incorrect orders- but this experience was where I drew the line. I actually tell this story of my experience to friends and family very frequently, because its almost comical how terrible my experience was, for one reason after another. Needless to say, none of them not I have ever returned to this location. I received the worst service from this location that I have ever received in my life. Not just the worst service compared to other papa johns locations, not just compared to any other pizza delivery place, and not even just compared to any restaurant in general of any type.   No, over the course of almost 3 hours, I received the worst customer service PERIOD that I have ever experienced or witnessed from any type of establishment. I called several times to complain about the many things that had gone wrong with my order, which included being blamed for pizzas that were dropped by the delivery driver before he even arrived to my house. And this was not one bad employee, this included multiple employees, including one of the managers, who tried to use the excuse of how busy he was and that they were understaffed as an excuse for the service and that he didnt have time to talk to me because he was doing this or that. That's your job, if you cant handle it, find something else to do. Nothing going on in your establishment is my fault, and I shouldn't have to pay for it.  One of the reasons why it took almost 3 hours, besides the repeated screw ups, was that I wasted almost 45 minutes of my night waiting for that same manager who said he was going to call me back when he got to the bottom of it, but then decided from his own judgement that \"it was taken care of\" when the final corrective order was sent out, so who didn't think there was any need to call me back, even though I was vocally unsatisfied with the service I had been receiving. He didnt even try to claim he was busy that time, he admitted that he didnt feel the need to call me back, despite saying he was going to.  No compensation was ever offered, despite the terrible service and several hour wait time (which ruined the entire night me and my girlfriend had planned), the manager insisted that re-delivering my order that THEY MESSED UP (which took several times before everything made it correctly), he thought that was good enough. After all of this happened, he actually said to me \"well everything is finally there now right? so it is all taken care of\". When he asked if there was anything else I needed, I firmly said YES, and that the issues had absolutely not been resolved, at which point he said he was sorry to hear that, told me to have a nice night, and hung up on me.  These actions were consistent through my entire experience that night. Having worked in the restaurant industry myself, I can say with certainty that this behavior is unacceptable, and would get you immediately terminated from any credible establishments. The problem is that the management itself is to blame as well as the employees. And it wasn't a lapse in judgement, or a \"bad night\"-the level of disrespect, disregard for customer satisfaction, and general lack of customer service skills these employees displayed could only exist to that extent in individuals who are truly and fundamentally unfit for any position requiring customer service.  tl;dr - you take a gamble by ordering from this location. If you do, you might get lucky and have no issues. Anyone who gives it a high rating is in this category. But there is also a very likely chance that the unfit management and careless employees will create a horrible experience for you, then proceed to not care one bit about it and not give you any compensation. In my opinion, the management and many of the employees would have been fired long ago if they were working literally anywhere else. There are plenty of other pizza options all over this area with exceptional service, so avoid this papa johns at any cost."}
{"text":"This location is close to my workplace, so we get pizza here on occasion. I think that it's better quality \"fast food\" pizza.  I always enjoy it and seem to continue coming back!  I always like to check online for specials, but this location seems to be pretty helpful with finding the best specials available.  My newest favorite: Giant Chocolate Chip Cookie!  If possible, put a scoop of ice cream on top for an even better tasting treat!"}
{"text":"I do love Papa John's pizza but this review has to do with the delivery drivers in this area who are coming from this location. I live in the neighborhood nearby and have frequently been tailgated by drivers even though I was driving over the speed limit. I have also witnessed more than once drivers going at over 50 mph in 25-35 mph zone. I get that they are trying to deliver pizzas fast but speeding in a neighborhood where kids are out playing is unacceptable. This has happened multiple times which is why I feel the need to review and post."}
{"text":"I wish I would have read the reviews sooner!  I just spent the last week sick with food poisoning because of their undercooked pizzas.  Three days of severe stomach cramping and missed work, then several more days of unpleasant diarrhea.  I ordered 2 XL pizzas, cheese and pepperoni, not too complicated.  When I opened the pizza box, I noticed that the pizzas looked much lighter in color than they usually do.  I didn't want to make a stink about it, but the kids also noticed that it tasted differently as well.  Long story short, the cheese was melted on the top, but the dough underneath wasn't cooked enough, which can carry strains of E. Coli according to the FDA.  https://www.fda.gov/ForConsumers/ConsumerUpdates/ucm508450.htm"}
{"text":"Papa johns is my go-to place for pizza delivery! This location in particular has always gotten my pizza to me on time and the delivery guys have always been very friendly."}
{"text":"I got 2 pizzas here a couple weeks ago...who gives a review a couple weeks after? That's how awful this pizza was that even in the future it's still on my mind! I got a pepperoni and some Mediterranean pizza... They were both equally awful! So gross I had to throw them away. Listen, I'm not a skinny guy, so for me to toss a pizza into the garbage it is truly awful. Papa Johns has never been high on my list but I've always been okay with it every now and then... But this is like that time you remember that night you did all those tequila shots and can't drink tequila again. Do yourself a favor and just pop a Digorno in the oven...also, I'm shocked that there are no other reviews of this place!"}
{"text":"I wanted to thank the manager Steve. I ordered a pizza with sausage and there was literally one to 2 sausages on the pizza slice...I communicated my frustrations since this isn't the only time it's happened...he heard me out and happily with a smile apologized and offered to make us another pizza freshly made with more sausage. I work for customers service oriented job and I just love how he acted, no I wasn't yelling lol but I'm sick with flu and he could of just said I'm sorry and basically deal with it... long story short Steve was great and very helpful and made everything right! Thank you Steve!!"}
{"text":"I can see why this location only has two stars I would give it a negative -5 if I could.   I walked at about 3pm to get a menu and noticed how dirty the place was. The Prep Station where they make the pizza was filthy all kind of stuff all over the counter.  There were pizza boxes all over the place left right everywhere, the fire department should come in and do an inspection that bad.    The place would be closed if the health department came in. I would never recommend ordering anything from Papa Johns especially seeing the 2 star rating.   Corporate should come in and redo the whole place and train everyone there. ."}
{"text":"Have ordered here more than a few times and each time the pizza has been great! Delivery service is fast and pizza is hot."}
{"text":"Always late and why is there now a $4 delivery charge. In the small print it explains it's not for the driver. So what's it for? might as-well go back to dominos."}
{"text":"Disgusting staff ...... asked to have pizza cut with a clean cutter due to pork restrictions in our diet so they put bacon on the pizza buried under the cheese , no doubt it was deliberate..... lawyer time !"}
{"text":"As pizza chains go, this one was on par.  I ordered online and arrived a few moments before the pizza was ready. I was immediately greeted upon arrival.  My pizza was prepared as requested. The staff persons were all codicil and even came round the counter to hand me my order. I don't live here but I'd order here again if I did."}
{"text":"This is the 2nd time I've received a call from this papa John's claiming that their delivery driver is either home sick or unable to make deliveries this late? I understand life happens, but be responsible enough to hire reliable drivers for your business."}
{"text":"We order from here all the time and have never had issues- however this last time my husband went ahead and ordered a few weeks back and the pizza came doughy undercooked and even the cheese wasn't fully melted. I called to complain -they apologized and were supposed to credit us on our next order- however- I just called to order for a quick meal without having to cook given the Holiday weekend- and NO notes, no credits- no history on our account... as if the order didn't even happen. Annoying to say the least, however the rep was very nice and talked to the manager.... I was charged $10 and change without having seen my receipt yet... so not really sure what was credited maybe 1/2 off- will update... but at this point a little disappointed that they didn't make note of it or go above and beyond to fix it considering how often we order from them..."}
{"text":"Don't waste your money you will have to buy 4 pizzas to equal 2.  So next time you decide you want a good quality pizza for   2 pizzas and pay $40, don't order from Papa Johns. It is THE biggest rip off of your money and you will still be hungry.  The pizzas had small slices and the size of medium ones. When I spoke to the owner about this he said we never ordered any pizza from there, gave him my husbands name, whom the pizza was ordered under and still said he had no order under that name. Then He asked for the # and gave him my husbands # and still said no order was placed there, when we just spent $40 and walked out with 2 pathetic size pizzas. I told him we just came in and picked them up and he miraculously remembered the. I asked how many pieces were on the medium he said 8 then when I explained we ordered large pizzas he said the large has 8 pieces also.   All he could say was sorry I was not satisfied. Amazing customer service!! Go to Rocos or dominos or even dare I say Pizza Hut. At least then you will get a pizza size equal to what you actually order."}
{"text":"Messed up my order.... Ordered pizza with Buffalo Swirl Topping and they forgot it... Lame."}
{"text":"I've been to this Papa Johns location a few times, and each experience has been great! The pizza is always perfect, and the service is always fast and friendly. Will definitely be coming back to this location regularly!"}
{"text":"I don't really like ordering delivery, and tonight reminded me why.  I had family over for movie night. We all gathered around the computer and everybody called out what they wanted on the pizza. We placed the order online, which is actually quite convenient. We orded a Large one-topping pepperoni pizza with bread sticks and a container of garlic sauce. They sent an order confirmation to my email and the estimated wait time was 104 MINUTES! 104 minutes for a meal that we could have easily picked up in 20.   I wasn't too starved, so I went a long with the whole thing. Around 40-50 minutes later, the pizza lady shows up at the door. She was in quite a bad mood and refused to make conversation while we were getting the money. I don't believe she said thank you after we gave her the tip which I dare say was way above what we should have tipped.  I digress... We took the pizza into the kitchen, opened it up, and found that something was totally wrong. The pizza was not pepperoni, it was sausage. We opened the breadstick container and found that they put too many sauces in there. Our order was mixed up with somebody else's. If they would have looked at the tag on the pizza, and then look inside of the box, they would have seen that the tag didn't match the contents of the box.  We didn't make a big fuss about it and we just ate the pizza despite not being big fans of sausage. #Firstworldproblems"}
{"text":"Sometimes your just to maxed out to cook or even talk for that matter.  The solution? Order online from Papa John's.  From the comfort of your own home you can log on, order your pizza to it's exact specifications and chill out and wait.  Order an hour in advance or on the fly.  My experience is that they stick to what ever the estimated time of delivery will be.  My only beef is the $2.50 delivery charge that does not go to the drivers.  But they are tipped accordingly when they deliver to me.  99% of the time they are with smiles when they show up at your door step.  The pizza is always as I ordered it and looks showroom ready for consumption.  Sign up for the Papa's point program.  When you max out you receive a free pizza.  They will also email you weekly specials that are at times so affordable you can't turn them down.  I am normally very suspect of any major franchise as large as Papa John's is.  But I do have to say they talk the talk and walk the walk.  It's a great back-up when your not in the mood to do anything else but eat."}
{"text":"Never on time. If you want a cold pizza that shows up 90 minutes after you order then go ahead and order from them and good luck"}
{"text":"Worst pizza I've ever had. (Not an exaggeration.) We tried the new Grilled Chicken Margarita pizza. There were about 2 piece of tomato per slice and 2-3 pieces of chicken. The \"thin\" crust was tasteless and over cooked. Waste of money. I thought Papa Johns was running a new campaign because they improved their pizza...but they didn't...must just be to try and make sales. Go to Marco's instead...way better."}
{"text":"This is the papa johns that delivers to my location. I just posted an image to show how unappetizing my pizza looked when it arrived. She must've been driving crazy to make the peppers fly all over and the pizza is squished at the bottom. You can see the cheese and toppings are also all smeared and smashed to the side.  One time they delivered the wrong pizza. Another time the pizza wasn't even cut (luckily I have a pizza cutter at home).   I prefer Papa Johns pizza over others, but maybe it is time to try a different services."}
{"text":"Ordered a pizza at night. Didn't let me know they were closed. Checked later they said they'd deliver at 11:00am. They didn't let me cancel. This place blows."}
{"text":"Great pizza as always. Friendly staff and always welcoming. The only bad thing I would have to say is the time it takes for them to make the pizzas at this location. It seems to take longer than most other papa johns I've been to. I've had only the pizza from this location, so I cannot comment on the entire menu, but if you want a good pizza at a fairly competitive price, papa johns is a great choice"}
{"text":"This place is awful!! They never deliver on time and the pizza isn't even good. I ordered from here twice and the order came 2 hours after it was supposed to because it said delivered and it hadn't been delivered. So when I call about it they mysteriously have to remake it"}
{"text":"Really wish I could give zero stars. My food arrived cold and 15 mins past the approximate delivery time. My driver called, which is not unusual because of my campus, and asked me where my building was and he repeated back to me the name of my building and said I'm standing outside of ___ where is your building? I told him I was coming down stairs. When I got to him he forgot a pen so we walked back to his car. After I signed he complained that there was no tip. Funny thing is that I did leave a time, which he read back to me like he was trying to guilt trip me into giving him more! I really wish I hadn't left a tip! Never ordering from papa johns again I'm sticking with Dominos!"}
{"text":"I'm a big fan of Papa John's pizza, but this place has made so many countless mistakes that I just had to write a review. Yes, countless mistakes. The first was when we moved into our new apartment a year ago. We were tired from moving and just wanted pizza. So I picked them up from the store and took them home only to notice they got one of the toppings wrong. It wasn't a big deal or anything major, so I let it slide.   The next mistake was a few months later. We again were craving pizza and my fiancé was at home while I was at work. She ordered pizza online and accidentally put pick up instead of delivery (I had the car and she couldn't go out). When she tried calling to change it they said they couldn't change it once it was in the system. That's one of the most ridiculous things I've ever heard. They wouldn't even let her cancel the order. So I had to take my break and work to pick up the pizza and bring it home. My fiancé  made a complaint online and one of the general manager's responded back and told her they would mail her a voucher for a free pizza in order to rectify the situation. We thought that was pretty nice of them. Things, however, only got worse.  A few weeks later when I wanted to use the voucher the manager or a higher level employee at the location looked at it and said \"How do I know this is authentic?\". Mind you, it had the GM signature on it. My response wasn't a kind one, something along the lines of \"Why the hell would I bring in a fake SIGNED voucher for some pizza?\". He eventually gave me the pizza after asking me 21 questions about where I got it and if it was real. It really pissed me off.  Then a few months later, I was at a client's home. The family had ordered pizza from this location and the delivery driver had the wrong pizzas. The order was completely wrong as the driver asked for a higher price than the one states on the phone. That was that.  I haven't been here since last fall and I'm hoping the place is a lot better. But honestly, this is one of the worse pizza places in terms of customer service. Don't get me wrong, some of the employees there are absolutely pleasant, helpful and nice to talk to while you wait for your food. But there's definitely enough bad apples and mistakes made to take away from what the good employees do for you. Look for another pizza place."}
{"text":"I took advantage of the 50% off deal. We ordered sodas. An pepperoni , works and a spinach Alfredo pizza along with some garlic parm breadsticks.   Papa johns pizza is the only place everyone in the family will agree on eating so I never have to run it by anyone how they want it or what they want and it never disappoints.   I usually don't review pizza delivery but seriously whoever delivered our pizza earlier today was really awesome. It arrived hot and cooked particularly well - maybe the heat outside helps keep it hot too!   I tipped already on our online order but I didn't feel like it was enough so I tried to have my son tip additional cash and he refused it. I know not every driver there is like this but its commendable that he was honest and knew there was already tip on order and wouldn't accept more even though he more than deserved it! My son insisted but he wouldn't take it. I'm recovering from a surgery so I couldn't chase after him but I'm so thankful they really made my day."}
{"text":"I needed 15 pizzas for a party I was having delivered at a specified time.  Everything went smooth,the pizza was amazing and the driver was nice, on time and brought all the cups and plates and drinks and napkins I asked for.  Now that I read other reviews they talk about the fluffiness of the crust and that's definitely a true statement now that I look back on eating it.  I wonder if there is a option for a crispier baking time.  I'll def ask next time.  Far life dipping sauce is something to fight over so order extras.  The pepper in the box adds some nice flare.  I don't live near a Papa Johns so when I get the chance it's the pizza I order and this place delivered on all levels to make my experience just as good as I remembered it to be before.  I would order from here again."}
{"text":"I attempted to order pizza online but it was having issues. No big deal, so I decided to call. I called stating the problem and that I would like to order for carryout. He then asked for all my info which already is in the system since I've ordered plenty of times. I had to explain again I wanted it for carryout. I also asked if I could get the carry out special since online was malfunctioning. All I received was attitude that they can't do that for me. I decided to take my business elsewhere from now on. Not worth the headache."}
{"text":"I order it for my employees occasionally.  The pizza is what you expect, nothing better than OK.  They throw on an extra $1.50 for delivery charge and the drivers tell us that most goes directly to the managers pockets.  That Sucks."}
{"text":"First time ordered from this location.  Waited for about 20 minutes for 2 large pies.  Average wait time.  Wasn't too busy with carry-out, but the drivers were going in and out with the deliveries.  Only come here when coupons are available.  Will try this place out again in the future."}
{"text":"I'm giving this a 2 star review because we usually love the pizza l, but the service from this location is just subpar.  We waiting an hour and a half for a delivery less than 10 minutes away from the store. I do understand that things take time and things can pop up beyond the control of the driver but that was too long. We called to check the order twice and were given no explanations of our order, only confusion. No one seemed to know where our order was or if it had even indeed gone out for delivery.  We had the order cancelled and refunded after wasting a good chuck of our evening before my fiance left for his over night shift. Extremely disappointed. Definitely would not try again for delivery."}
{"text":"Worst pizza ever. Cheese came cold but when I heated up it never did melt. What do they use? Never again"}
{"text":"We love papa johns and order pizza almost weekly. Because this is the only one that delivers to our house, we do go here about once a month. However, we frequent the other local spots too due to the problems at this location: They arent part of the other locations so those discounts dont apply, you have to order online to get through and make sure the order is right, they never seem to add extra cheese no matter how you order (adding 3 cheese or extra cheese as a topping doesnt work), and there is not enough cheese on pan pizza. On the positive side, they deliver quickly and the lady delivery driver is awesome. We will keep ordering as my 5 kids prefer it to the designer pizzas elsewhere, but I wish they would start managing better."}
{"text":"Horrible service and bad attitudes Received my pizza it looked like it had been flipped tossed and turned by the time it got to me. I called the store but got nothing but  attitude and disrespect from Cody and Cal. I won't be  ordering from this place ever again."}
{"text":"Madison, WI Papa John's Pizza - Josh was extremely helpful, patient and compassionate today - I wanted to send a surprise birthday pizza to my brother and it turned out he wasn't home to accept delivery, and Josh helped with the fiasco very professionally!  Thank you so much (:"}
{"text":"My son and I have had Papa John's (Euclid) for years and years.  For both takeout and delivery, we have always been very pleased."}
{"text":"Without a doubt one of the best pizza places I've been too on the east side of Phoenix"}
{"text":"Very slow delivery service. No compensation offered although the pizza was very late. I normally do not order from chain restaurants when I'm out of town because I like to try something different. Unfortunately everything local was closed. I would not order from them again."}
{"text":"FYI- if you have a complaint here's the #- 1-877-547-7273. This place has way too many bad reviews to still be standing in this neighborhood. I wonder if the DM or Franchise Owners are aware of the people that are running their store?? Wish I can give this place a 0- Terry the GM is horrible. Said she couldn't find my order to place a refund and gave me another # to call. Come to find out - she had the order in her system as #2 the entire time (per customer service rep-Allison from the number she gave me) not sure if she just wanted to give me a hard time but it was very unsettling to know that she wasn't doing everything to make sure I got my money back. I called Terry back right after I spoke with Alison just to confirm the order was in fact cancelled and \"WHALLA\" she FOUND it and cancelled it. On the bright side- the number she gave me allowed me to put a complaint straight to the owner & manufacturing Co. To know that she's supposed to be RUNNING the entire store?? It's obvious she thought I was being difficult and in turn decided to make things difficult for me. No thank you. I will NEVER order from here again. God forbid, all I wanted to do was change my order time from 12pm-11am. I hate to give bad reviews but this was nerve wrecking and unsettling to say the least. It felt like they just were not wanting to help or give me me money back."}
{"text":"Why am I giving another pizza chain a 5 star review? Because they have a rewards program then keep earning me free pizzas that actually do taste good. I order online and every time you order papa point accumulate. It only works if you order online for the papa points. Not only do I earn points when I order but they just randomly give me enough points for a free pizza for ordering. Once over super bowl last year I did a coin toss online and guess correct so they gave me a free large 3 topping pizza then too. They also often have a promotion where when you buy a pizza online you get a free pizza on your next order.  I usually always pick up my order because I feel like a lazy ass having them deliver me free food. I still give a tip as a thanks. They always open my pizza and show it to me to make sure it is right. The pizza here is good and the ingredients are fresh. the crust is tasty and goes well with the free garlic butter in each pizza box.  Stay away from the chicken poppers. They are gross and taste like something you got from the cafeteria in grade school. Maybe worse."}
{"text":"1 hour and 50 minutes to receive a cold gelatinous pizza. They think this is acceptable."}
{"text":"Experienced horrible customer service starting with the guy at the front counter who never even looked up, nodded , spoke or acknowledged my existence in any way. Next there was a discrepancy on the bill regarding an additional charge and instead of trying to fix it, the girl at the cash register blew off my concerns and said \" oh well it's still a good deal!\" I then emailed the manager listed on the door (TRutledge) over a week ago and haven't been acknowledged by this person either. Looks like the customer service at this store is learned from the top."}
{"text":"About a month back I prefer delivery from them. It took over an hour and half cause the driver was new . I called and spoke with a manager  Allegedly and was told they would credit my account with a free pizza . I call in a few weeks later and the person I spoke with said there is nothing noted on my account . I explained the situation and was told he couldn't do anything for me cause it was just hear say and he can't go off my word so pretty much called me a liar lol I was like wow great costumer and I would contact their corporate about this to which he replied \" is there anything else I can help u with if not good bye \" and hung up ....I can see why papa Johns sales is down ... amazing"}
{"text":"Both pizzas showed up cold, soggy and two hours late. They knew it was that late and that I was unhappy and did nothing to make up for it or to keep a customer. I'll never order from any Papa Johns again. If I had read the other reviews on Yelp first, I would not have ordered from them in the first place. Lesson learned."}
{"text":"This location is a joke.  Consistently they are saying \"We are backed up.\"  When ordering our pizza online.  I for one do not want to hear that.   This is supposedly a great pizza place with what I would imagine a lot of money to say oh I don't know HIRE MORE DRIVERS.  As a profession they should strive for excellence not  excuses.  At this rate I'd rather go down to Smith's pay for a pizza that can be put into my own oven with no excuses from anyone.  Either get it together Papa John's Pizza on 241 N. Nellis Blvd.  Or you'll be losing me as a customer."}
{"text":"Ordered a pizza recently due to not wanting to cook at home after a long day at work.  Stopped by the store, not busy at all, placed an order, told that it'll be ready in about 15-20 minutes, left to meet few friends that were having dinner at the near-by restaurant.  Stopped by back after about 25 minutes and the pizzas were waiting for me.  Don't even need to tell them what pizzas I ordered, they knew right away.  Friendly staff, won't push you for ordering a larger size.  Good location near Scottsdale Airport.  I shall be back again here."}
{"text":"This location needs to get it togather this is second time I order and my pizza was not only late with the 37 min time frame I was told at check out my pizza was cold and the wings and cheese bread as well and I order early so it would get to me time for my lunch break which it didn't and when it got hear it only left me with 7 min to eat my lunch I mean what is the purpose ordering early if it not going come on time.I mean this is second time this happen to me I mean I love papa John's but the Thomas location is making me hate it because how the service is I mean they need to get right over there. Because truly if I could give a zero I would but I can't so that is,why it gets 1 star"}
{"text":"We go to this Papa John's all the time. Service has always been quick and friendly. The one time they messed up the order, I called and they immediately gave a coupon for a free pizza to make it up.  IMHO Papa John's is the best chain pizza out there - much better than Domino's, Pizza Hut, or Little Caesar's (although any pizza is always good).  The only drawback is that delivery can take up to 45 minutes and since the store is less than 10 minutes from my house, I always do carryout.  But, if you're in the area and craving pizza, I recommend this Papa John's."}
{"text":"I've ordered from here before and this always happens so here I am finally saying something about it! They said 30 mins and it has almost been an hour- why even say 30 mins. Or call me and tell me."}
{"text":"This location used to be really good but lately the delivery and pizza itself are not worth the high prices. Today I placed a delivery order at 11:00 am and it took over an hour to get here and when it did the pizza was cold. I literally live in the neighborhood behind the store so it should not take an hour to get a cold pizza.   The last 3 or 4 times we have ordered from them it's been the same thing. Guess this is the last time ordered from here."}
{"text":"There's about 4 pizza places within 2 mi of our house but chose here because of the garlic sauce and peppercinnis.. Called, ordered,guy on phone said it would be over an hr for our order to be here. Our hearts were set so we agreed. An hr exactly we received a VM from the driver saying he was here (9220) but our address is 9290. Then he proceeded to say he was here, knocked, called, got no answer so the order was canceled. Wtf!? No knock.. And we have a dog who barks at every outside noise!!! So frustrating!! Called the place, girl on the phone sounded annoyed then asked if I wanted to talk to the mngr. he listened to me vent, apologized and said the next driver will deliver it within 15 minutes. We waited 30.. Heard nothing so called back and canceled before calling dominoes. as soon as we hung up with dominoes the door bell rang and papa johns was here we told the young guy we didn't want it and he apologized saying he heard about the confusion and it was on the house. We tipped him $10 after hearing him tell us how horrible a new delivery guy is. Then called dominoes back to cancel. 2 stars only because of the guy who was so annoyed with the new delivery guy"}
{"text":"What can I say this one was extremely horrible, there's nothing good I can say about this, the pizza was somehow overcooked and undercooked at the same time .  It made both of us sick , also the chicken poppers were soggy , fast food nuggets would have been better. Beyond a let down"}
{"text":"I've ordered from this location multiple times, and I have not experienced any challenges. They're quick, friendly, and they accept Panther Funds. Be advised that there is no seating inside, and there is a parking lot located adjacent to the building."}
{"text":"So if you don't know Papa John's Pizza has a deal when the Arizona Diamondbacks win, you get 50% off your pizza. Just type in DBACKS50 for your coupon code (entire order) and get a great deal. They've always been fast - I order online and by the time I drive there (5-10min) they are done and waiting on me. Love their pizza... now if I can just keep people from stealing it from the fridge (AT WORK!)"}
{"text":"It's your average pizza chain. You know what you're going to get. Online ordering makes it easy, and if the Dbacks win the previous night, using code DBACKS50 will get you 50% off original prices. That's the only time I will order from here."}
{"text":"I h Ave ordered from this location on many occasions and every time there has been something wrong in one way or another. The most recent order they completely misplaced the order and then lied to me about it I hope that they get it together I will not be using them again."}
{"text":"Just ordered my umpteenth pizza from this place. I've never had a problem and my pizza is always ready on time for carry-out. I've racked enough points for a free one but I'm just saving it for a rainy day. Place is clean and the staff is always friendly."}
{"text":"Placed an order for delivery.  Was told to expect up to 45 minutes.  No problem.  Pizza arrived an hour and 5 minutes later very cold.  Didn't tip the driver and told him why.  He didn't seem to care what so ever.  I have patronized this pizzeria numerous times over the years with excellent service.  The last few purchases I notice the service has steadily gone down.  Will not patronize any longer."}
{"text":"Delicious pizza!!! Love the app!! Get points and free pizza or other stuff!! Got an upgrade today!!! So, extra large 3 topping pizza and only spent $2.17!!"}
{"text":"We order from this Papa John's every Sunday so we can sit with the family and watch football but unfortunately tonight or pizza came to us looking like this all of the toppings were on the lid of the box I had to scrape the Box the delivery driver was aware of it and he did offer to remake the pizza and send it out however after I looked at what was on the pizza I had the wrong toppings order grilled chicken and got crispy so when I called them the manager told me that they were out of the grilled chicken so just decided to put crispy chicken on the pizza instead without notifying me.."}
{"text":"I am very disappointed with the service from Papa Johns I received last night. When we called to modify our online order an employee said that our order didn't go through so naturally we placed an order over the phone. Both orders ended up arriving which shows poor communication in the workplace. When the second order arrived we had informed the employee on the phone that we needed enough change to break a $100 bill but,  the delivery woman did not have the change we asked for. Also, our pepperoni pizza came as a cheese pizza, our barbecue wings were mild, and our liter of root beer did not arrive even though we payed for it. Overall I'm not mad I'm just disappointed."}
{"text":"Every time I order PJP it is off the internet.  Be it in Hendo and now Vegas, 99.7% of the time there is never an issue.  There are times when one just does not want to unwrap the grill or slave over stove.  Papa's is a solid option when one does not want to have anything to do with meal preparation.  As for the Farm location, Be it Sunday, Friday or a Saturday after placing my order, they are quick to deliver.  Everyone who shows up to deliver has been courteous and friendly.  The ZA arrives hot and as ordered. I order online.  The best is the weekly deals which saves cash and after so many orders, your Papa's points get you a......free pizza!"}
{"text":"So I ordered a large pepperoni and mushroom pizza and the bacon cheese breadsticks online for carry out at this location. I was never sent a confirmation or even a time to pick up my pizza (let's note that Pizza Hut gives you a confirmation before you even leave the site, and Domino's tells you exactly where your pizza is at in the process!). So half an hour later, waiting for this friggin' email, I leave to go pick it up. Of course I get there, and they have to confirm my credit card and all that jazz, I get my order and take it home. When we finally sit down to eat, it's already cold. Fabulous. They seem to be a little stingy with the mushrooms in particular. Also, the breadsticks are pretty lame. I imagine it started out as a small pizza crust, and they put cheese and bacon on top. Nothing like the photographs at all.   All in all, if you're dying to order Papa John's here are some tips:  1. Don't order online. 2. Make sure you remember to ask for cheese and peppers, because they surely won't ask you. 3. Don't order the sides, I imagine all the breadsticks to be as lame and flat as mine. I think or 10 are supposed to come in an order, you get them all, but some pieces end up being half the size of others (round pizza crust).  4. Make sure you order double toppings, because I imagine that to be comparable with other pizza chains."}
{"text":"1.8/5 stars - Only reason to get this pizza is if you are a college student and only have 5 bucks. But let's face it even crappy pizza tastes good."}
{"text":"papa johns is the worst pizza you can get besides frozen crap pizza, and the employees are no better too. i have managed restaurants for years and i make pizzas from scratch. there are no better ingredients at papa johns. your lucky if you get any!!!! ingredients on a pizza. the sauce is horrible. you have no clue mr . papa john. i think i will open my own chain and take all your business away from you. i cant stand your commercials either you look so fake. i would rather eat cardboard with crap on it than your pizza. even dominos is better than yours and i cant stand dominos. but at least they have stepped it up with their deep dish. depending on the location dominos deep dish is good. at least better than your crap. i cant believe you have so much licensing with all these major ball clubs, and everyone else when your pizza is so bad. i bet you dont even eat it mr. papa friggin fraud john. why dont you get some better recipes, and employees, oh i know you have made too much money all ready you dont need too. all you do is keep opening locations and charge huge franchise fees.  at least little ceasars gives you a deal and their pizza is actually decent. garbage mr papa john garbage the only thing good in the box is the garlic butter and the peppercini..."}
{"text":"I ordered a medium pizza with 3 toppings on half and an order of the pull apart bread. I recieved toppings on 2 slices and brownies instead of bread. Friday night at 7pm may be busy for them, considering it took an hour for it to get to me, but this seemed lazy. Back to pizza hut I guess."}
{"text":"The worst Papa John's experience I've ever had! I ordered Pizza for my coworkers and had the Pizza's delivered to my job. Not only did they get one of the Pie toppings incorrect but they just didn't taste good. Was not the Papa Johns quality we were use to...When I called to advise one of our pies were incorrect, the Cashier who answered the phone literally argued with me telling me I was wrong! He stated he was the one that took my order and he knew what he heard! I couldn't believe what I was hearing!!! I asked to speak to the manager and I was then told that they could make another Pizza and have it delivered. The correct pizza came an hour later! Never again will my job be ordering from this location!! Customer service is vital to any establishment and bad service is NOT acceptable!"}
{"text":"Ordered pizza online - he took an hour to deliver at the house like its just 10 mins away  Last month, idk what it is but I went inside to order just one box of pizza and chicken on the side and the lady said it'll be 30 mins wait and I saw like 30 people working in the back"}
{"text":"This place is Rocks!!  Always good service....I've been coming here for years and am never disspointed!!"}
{"text":"Called and ordered a cheese pizza, went to pick it up and did not open the box until I got home.  Pizza was burnt.  I wrote 2 emails to their corporate office and never received a reply.  I've never had to open a box while in any other pizza place.  I will never go back to Papa John's.  Their pizza is burnt and their customer service skills are terrible."}
{"text":"Once again this Papa Johns branch screwed up a large order for my staff. I ordered 7 pizzas the day before we needed them and they verified the order and the time, called again on the day of the delivery and again verified that they had the order correct. When the delivery came it was one pizza short. When I asked the delivery guy he got aggro and told me it's not his problem, when I called the store I got an extremely angry employee that was a complete jerk and denied the order I had verified with him a couple hours previously.  I will never go back to this store, I have had the delivery driver banned from our building, and will be doing everything in my power to raise awareness of this pathetic branch."}
{"text":"Please don't tell me 20 mins on the phone ... and when I show up in  15 min and pay for it, wait more 10 mins .... then you ask me my name again and you tell me- \"we are getting to it\" ( not even in the oven---- because I'm watching it)..... I get angry and want refund and the manager is surprised. ?!??!,  .... the s**t should have been ready! I have a hungry wife and kids at home!!!?? WTF.....so  I ordered down the street ( dominos -  not my favorite, actually I hate both places)---picked it up on the way home, no problems---  they told me 15 mins and it was ready in 15 mins."}
{"text":"The pizza made us sick. We got the chipotle bacon and some cheese sticks. A few hours later, we both immediately became ill. I say stay away...."}
{"text":"Ordered from here twice both times pizzas are cold and doughy. Managers aren't the nicest either."}
{"text":"Took over 1 hour and 20 minutes to deliver.  From online order.  Confirmation said 40-50 minutes...  call they just gave excuses.  No compensation....  driver still took 15 minutes to arrive... more excuses at the door even when i did not say anything to him.   Pizza was cold....  very frustrating for 300 pm on a sunday afternoon.   Very poor customer service"}
{"text":"No thanks - a bunch of children run the shop. Did an online order for a thin pizza for pick up.  I was left standing there for 5 min while they threw a credit card at each other behind the counter while trying to key in someone's order.  After they were done having all their fun, they got around to ask me what I wanted.  So after my wait, I got my now even colder pizza that was sitting around.  The pizza sucked - and it really sucked. Cold and tasteless.  At almost $18 for a 14\" thin curst, I think you could actually do better with frozen pizza from Safeway  There are not many choices but this place gets nothing right - Save yourself the disappointment and frustration and just make the effort to go a elsewhere."}
{"text":"I won a free Papa John's Pizza from the MS Society, as part of the Bike MS ride.  I stopped at this location to use it.  The team was friendly, and made it very quickly while I waited.  I was pleasantly surprised and pleased with the pizza.  I'll keep going back to Papa John's because of the pizza, and their support of the MS Society."}
{"text":"Ordered a pizza online and it still wasn't here after 1 hour fifteen minutes so I called them and asked if my  pizza was on the way as I'd been waiting for almost an hour and twenty minutes at this point. Without even asking what order I was, the lady said all the drivers were out and before I could tell her who I was, she hung up. My roommate called back and asked to speak to the manager to which they informed her that the manager wasn't there. She then said that if the pizza was cold when it arrived that we wouldn't pay for to which the lady rudely replied that their pizzas are made in order and that it's obviously going to be fresh and hot. It arrived after an hour and a half and it was cold but I paid and tipped the driver before bringing it inside and realizing it was ice cold. So good job Papa John's for lying and stealing from starving students. Students eat pizza a lot and you for sure have lost my pizza business. If I could give you 0 stars, I would."}
{"text":"This was our very first experience with this particular Papa Johns and I have to say I was really happy. Baked pizza perfection! I also LOVE that they gave me a choice of how I wanted it cut! We chose squared cut and my picky 8 yr old ate more!! I will definitely be ordering again. Delivery was SUPER fast!!"}
{"text":"It's hard to be consistently disappointed when you're already expecting mild disappointment, but you've managed to do just that Papa John's. Orders jacked up more than once; deliveries running 15 minutes late like it's your job... But tonight was the last straw. Almost an hour late for mediocre (at best), middle-of-road, national chain pizza on a Tuesday (meaning no major pizza consuming televised sporting events) evening - horseshit! I'm done with you. When I want to be disappointed in shitty pizza, I'll use your location on Mesa and Brown."}
{"text":"On the plus side, it was round and vaguely resembled pizza.  On the negative side, I'd have to list every other attribute of this pizza.   At least the flavor went away after I brushed my teeth twice with Colgate.  Icky, icky, icky.  (You can quote me on that).   Salty.   No other flavor but salt.   Super skimpy on the toppings.   And those toppings had no flavor either.  And... what happened to the sauce?  There practically was no sauce.   That actually was a good thing, as it was disgusting.  I absolutely hated this salty, nasty, mushy pizza at any price.   Next time, I'll find a locally-owned place and if they don't deliver, I'll be happy to get in my car to go pick it up.   Even if I have to drive to Tokyo - under water.  That pretty much sums it up."}
{"text":"This place sucks. We ordered from here a few weeks ago and after over an hour the pizza was still not delivered. We were told something about them being very busy. I recently placed an order on a Thursday night at 8:00 PM and the delivery time was 75 minutes even though the location is 3 miles from my house. This place needs to get their act together. This place is absolutely terrible."}
{"text":"I ordered online and used a coupon code so my large pizza was only $10.50 with all the taxes and delivery fee. Even though they say 30-40 minutes my pizza arrived exactly 17 minutes after I placed my order. The delivery driver was super friendly as they always are and my pizza was yummy. Sometimes they can be a bit undercooked but this time it was perfect. They did a great job."}
{"text":"I want to inform you of poor service by your General Manager at this location. I placed a order back on August 25, 2017 for 3 XL Pizzas. When they arrived there was hardly any cheese on them and 1 was suppose to have extra cheese. I called the store they said the manager had to handle it and wasn't in. I asked when he would be back in they said he is off for 3 days. So I filled out the customer feedback on line. I got a email to contact Alex Deutsch. So I tried calling him every time I called he was out. Until today I got a hold of him. You could tell he wasn't thrilled to talk to me. So I explained to him the situation. He told me \"It had to be handled 24 hrs of the time of the order.\" I told him I did call but he was off that day and was off the next 3 days. Sorry he said but can't do anything. I said to him really find that hard to believe when I've been trying to get a hold of you and supposedly you were never in. Well I put up on Trip Advisor and going to Yelp and let everyone know what this guy thinks of his customers. I use to be a manager for a couple of Pizza places and know you can fix it if you want.  Because you lost my family, friends and others cause of this. This was my 1st time trying Papa Johns Pizza and possibly my last."}
{"text":"Not only is this the worst Papa Johns I've ever tasted - they NEVER get your order right!! You order a pepperoni pizza and they somehow deliver a pineapple and sausage pizza COLD  I call to let them know and they put a free pizza on the account.  2 weeks later we give them another chance and they manage to screw it up again this time with no cheese on the pizza  and COLD AGAIN ? so I call to complain again and after 3 tries we give up!!! They just suck or don't care or just plain....  Anyway...we drive to Pizza Hut now to get our pizza since we don't live close enough for them to deliver BUT IT IS SOOOOOO WORTH IT!! Pizza Hut in Waxhaw is VERY GOOD VERY VERY GOOD!!  So needless to say we no longer eat Papa John's Pizza ?"}
{"text":"Will keep ordering because it's the closest place around. But they called me one time and said it would be a two hour delay on my order. So I will get credit for it and the next meal will be free. It wasn't . Then the last time I ordered 30 minutes advance and it was carry out and they still didn't have my shit ready had to wait an extra 30 minutes for my stuff. Now today I look at the app and it says just making it when I ordered it at like 845 and it's gonna take an hour and a half to get delivered. That's ridiculous. I know it's not as good but next time I'm just doing dominos."}
{"text":"I called because I forgot to change what kind of sauce I wanted on my pizza after I ordered online. I wish I could remember his name because the guy who answered the phone was so sweet and good about it. And the delivery guy was also extremely nice and they came in a very timely manner. And then the pizza was delicious! Very happy!!!!"}
{"text":"As far as pizza chains go this is the one in our area we patronize. Good pizza,  frequent specials and coupon offers to make more affordable. Usually do pickup but whenever have had delivered always quick, hot and courteous drivers."}
{"text":"So happy there is finally a Paradise Valley location! None of the other locations would deliver here ..New and clean and making the best pizza - Thanks for coming to the Seville :)"}
{"text":"Horrible customer service the guy that took my order didn't D Have a apt number he knew I lived in a apt but never looked or asked for one so I assumed he has my full address .pizzas never showed up they called a cell number that was not working and never asked at the time of the order for a call back number. I called the store because the pizza never came instead of a sorry we will get it right out..they kid said we can cancel the order.. No I want the order but stated the drive went back to the store a mile away lol. I called the driver his phone didn't work.. Nope never again!  Rude and can't figure out how to take a order"}
{"text":"Papa John's Pizza is AWESOME!!! Great service and fast delivery!!! Patrick is always attentive and you can hear the enthusiasm in his voice. I always choose this location for carry out and best of all, they deliver to my work!!! Thank you Papa John's team!!!"}
{"text":"Although this Papa John's is a little hard to find, it left me full, satisfied and happy on a night when I didn't have the time to cook a decent dinner.  The staff is friendly and they had my pizza ready in perfect time.  The pizza was delicious by the way! It was my first time trying Papa John's Pizza and I LOVE that the crust wasn't greasy at all! It was a dry crust and I enjoyed every last bite.  They also give you dipping sauces with your pizza which truly add the perfect splash of flavour.  I was very happy with the service, the pizza and the overall experience.   I'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"I ordered delivery through the app in the app confirmed my delivery address then I checked the email and it said that it was going to be carry out. So I called the restaurant to change that and they told me they would have to charge my card again and then they turned around and said that they didn't charge it in the first place. I signed on to my bank while talking with the store and there were two charges put through and I asked to speak to a manager because the kid had no idea what he was talking about in the manager yelled at me and claimed he had no idea what was going on with the order and they couldn't control anything with finances being taken out. Then I asked for corporates number and he gave me a bogus number. I'm definitely going to get the right one and report his store."}
{"text":"My order took over 55 minutes to arrive. I had a pizza and some chicken wings, chicken poppers, and a salad. Everything was ice cold and even the garlic sauce was congealed because it wasn't hot or fresh and it it been so long since they had sent it out. The delivery guy tried to give my order to my neighbor because he didn't bother to read which apartment it was going to. The chicken poppers were cold and flavorless, and overall I was completely unsatisfied. I only gave it two stars because everything in the order was correct."}
{"text":"uh oh, I really hate to write a bad review after defending from the bad allegations and again, the issue is not glaring, but nonetheless a big issue that will be terminating my business of ten years if not dealt with.  A few weeks ago, I ordered and a young, somewhat unkempt, but because she thought it was \"cool\" girl was at the register with her emo hair flying wildly out of her hat.  As both a customer and a former employer of teens in food labor, this was very disgusting and off putting for me and I really don't want to eat from someone who just handed me my food with straggly, wild hair everywhere.  I would have preferred the girl have a little more of a clean cut style, but she also wasn't necessarily unclean.  Just personally also disgusting to see people mutating their ears with those plug things.  The issue was just more of a management issue of teaching teens about proper work place hygiene in a kitchen.    As everyone mentioned below, I sent a review through papa john's website to corporate only to get no response and when I went in today had the same exact girl with the same exact issue of \"cool\" scruffed up hair wildly bursting out of her ball cap....this also led me to see that no one was wearing gloves of any kind, nor hair nets.  I have always felt that the kitchen was decently ran and clean, but noticing an unkempt employee makes one glance further and my stomach is a little turned off.    It would be nice if papa john responded to customer relations because they may have just lost a pizza a week customer for the last ten years."}
{"text":"I ordered two pizzas here for the kid's birthday party. We had a coupon but I wanted to ad the \"points\" to my Papa Points. The coupon couldn't be used over the phone for some reason so they told us to make our order as close as possible and then call back with the special instructions (double pineapple and double pepperoni). We did just that and all came out well. They could have easily told us to screw off but didn't. Even when picking the pizzas up they made sure that I knew that they followed the special called-in instructions. Great experience."}
{"text":"I ordered a pizza at 4:49. Got an email that said my pizza would be delivered at 5:18 to5:28. 5:38 still no pizza. Called the store. They said it was out for delivery. I said I knew that it was suppose to be delivered 10 minutes ago. 5:48. Still no pizza. Called the store back. Again, I was told it was out for delivery. 5:48 called the store again. When I was on the phone the pizza came. When it arrived it was COLD."}
{"text":"This is an embarrasment to pizza. The \"large\" pizza was barely 13\" and it took over an hour for delivery. $20 after tip. I'll never be a customer again."}
{"text":"Use to order all the time from Papa Johns in Cali, but never again here. Pizza was not full filling and the cheese/sauce ratio was not good. Wings weren't great either...the only good part of the food was the crust (was soft with crisp edges)... service was 4 stars tho..."}
{"text":"Waited 2 hours for a pizza and nothing. I'm sure it will eventually show up but I have to go to work already late because I was starving and wanted to eat before I go to work and now I'm just hangry.  After over an hour we called to check because we were told 30 min and they said they couldn't find our house??? They've been here plenty of times. They said they tried calling??? Bullshit not 1 call or voicemail. Then they offered to deliver the same old pizza to us??? No thanks I'd like a new one, thinking that should take an additional 10 min tops but nope over an hour later after the first hour later and I'm done waiting off to work with no food in my stomach. I called to ask what happened and the lady that answered was very rude. I asked for the manager and she hit me with the \"I am the manager\". No apology, nothing at all other than being very rudely defensive about why it took 2 hours. I forgot to get her name. She sucks at her job. Never ordering here again."}
{"text":"This is the slowest delivery of any pizza place ever... First time I ordered it took an hour and 40 minutes and everything was cold . I figured I would give them another chance and they said 30 to 40 minutes but once again it took over an hour and of course everything was luke warm at best . called to complain and the customer service is there is pathetic giving attitude to their customers. Short handed all the time? Who doing the schedule there? The manager is obviously driving this business into the ground. Don't waste your time with these guys. Call a different location if you want hot and fast delivery. I'll never order from here ever again."}
{"text":"My first and only visit so far, May 2014. Ordered online 3pm on a Tuesday, delivered at 3:33. I live aprox 6 blocks away.   From a first time customer perspective the web site said I would get an email with delivery time and total cost, it never arrived which left me dangling as to if the order was even received. Half hour later I saw a truck pull up on the security camera. My tip was 20%.   I got a large custom with my choice of toppings, which I felt were a little sparse. I would compare this to Pizza Hut but say the pizza is one step below Pizza Hut, 'acceptable'. You can tell they don't put much effort into using quality ingredients, probably everything arrives frozen or canned in the store, and it shows.   This is like the McDonalds of pizza chains, poor quality but reliable service and results. And remember, on Yelp 3-stars means A-OK.  If you go to the Papa John's web site, then on About Papa John's, then on Ingredients and read the descriptions, I tend to doubt that my pizza was made from any of those ingredients."}
{"text":"Last-minute decision to order and it hit the spot. Friendly girl on the phone, friendly delivery guy, delivered within the said time-frame, and was good!"}
{"text":"Are use them quite often and always leave a tip pizza is always been delivered at a reasonable time the delivery drivers have always been nice as well I like the fact that they're close to my house which is always great because I can save money by picking it up if I need enjoy their wings and will be using them again"}
{"text":"Ugh.  I used to love Papa Johns but this location does not do it justice.    We have ordered the buffalo chicken pizza in the past when it was first introduced here.  The base is ranch sauce with sliced chicken strips, bacon, onion, cheese and topped with a swirl of buffalo sauce.  Our Buffalo chicken pizza arrived with no buffalo drizzle on top.  Wouldn't they know this is probably the main ingredient which makes it a 'Buffalo' chicken pizza?   I called to let them know and the manager apologized.  Decided to give them a second chance.  I told them what happened last time.  Again, received the pizza with no buffalo drizzle on top. Seriously?? Even after a phone call to order instead of my normal online ordering they still managed to make this incorrectly.    Big Fail."}
{"text":"Rude customer service, I called to order my pizza and when he told me the price of the pizza my phone signal got cut off for 2 second so I didn't catch what he said, so when I ask him to repeat it one more time he snaps and raised his voice with obvious attitude as if I didn't listen to him the first time. LOL. If you don't like your job then just quit, don't take it out on the customer please, some of us didn't do anything and just want to order pizza. I probably won't order from here again."}
{"text":"They really need to reconsider this place as a Papa John's Pizza. The only reason I order from here is that my son likes it, but they are far from a legitimate pizza place. Apparently, you have to order Extra Cheese to get any cheese at all on your pizza. I don't mind paying for extra cheese, but when I consistently don't get it, that is worthless. Just ordered my last pie from this place, they skimp on toppings and most of the pizzas are substandard. Good luck in the future. I guess that's why they need to have a guarantee that their pizza is going to be liked. I don't want to have to order another pizza that is correct, I just want to receive the correct pizza I ordered the first time. Lame, stay away from this place unless you don't appreciate a good pie."}
{"text":"I stopped here 12/16 around 7pm to order a few pizzas for dinner.  I placed my order the guy took my payment and walked over to make pizzas.  I didn't see him wash his hands or anything but thought maybe I just didn't see it. ( gave him the benefit of the doubt  after all who would do something so gross. Handle Money and then touch food. ). So then another customer comes in  pays with cash.  the same guy takes the money and then walks right over to a bin of dough and begins to stretch it and shape it.  I work with money all day. Money is filthy it smells like sweat and who knows where it has been.  I then asked to cancel my pizzas and get my money back. He told me he didn't make my pizza yet. Well yay for me. bummer for anyone getting pizza from here on Tuesday night.  I'm going guess that is a common practice at this papa johns that guy appeared to be the manage so if he doesn't care about hygiene then his employees don't either.  So I won't be returning to this papa johns."}
{"text":"Just ordered for delivery and spoke with Shane over the phone. He said he was in training. He did a great job! Very polite! He asked questions when he didn't know. He wanted to get it right. I for one appreciate that! Thank you Shane!"}
{"text":"I go here when I'm around the area not a great place for pizza they don't put any love in making a pizza they just figured we would eat slop or something pizza half cooked it's the same as frozen pizza got to be pretty desperate but I try to eat elsewhere."}
{"text":"HORRIBLE!  Hospital nurses ordered pizzas and the pizzas were BURNT and the others...just had sauce?! What?!  only sauce...is this a joke?  Manager (20 something) redelivered, with pizzas, but ARGUED with staff stating, \"its not burnt\" then continued to take photos of the pizza...RIGHT IN FRONT OF US, and then refused to give us the new pizzas that he brought...to replace the BURNT ONES?  WHAT!?  Please... please don't order from this particular restaurant."}
{"text":"My kids love Papa John's Pizza!  As a bonus they support ending MS and are a partner of Bike MS!"}
{"text":"Messed up my pizza order 2 times and did not allow me to get a refund. Manager said to me it's not his problem that it was mine and was unprofessional with me. Definitely not buying from this location ever again."}
{"text":"I can't remember reviewing a chain pizza place...as they're all hit/miss. But not this location. We've yet to have a bad pie from this Papa John's.  Always in a pinch when we need to order in or take out - this location has never disappointed us. The pizza tastes SO GOOD!  It's never been over/under cooked, they're generous with their toppings, and the delivery staff especially is extremely friendly.  We highly recommend this Papa John's!"}
{"text":"I've always liked Papa John's.  Not the very best out there, but when I'm driving right by them, it serves the purpose.  Today I decided last minute to place an order on my way home from work. I was starving and tired.   I almost hung up when a guy answered the phone. I had to call twice because I got hung up on the first time. I wasn't sure I had the right number because I couldn't understand a single word he said.  When I got the pizza home, it wasn't sliced, at all. Really? What pizza place forgets to slice their pizzas?! The pizza was also kind of soggy/doughy. Not real appetizing.   $14 for a medium, plain cheese pizza. Their medium looks like a small. I can get a large pepperoni at Barro's for $13 and much better quality.  Sourdough Pizza, Oregano's, Barro's; so many other choices. I'll go with one of these better options the next time."}
{"text":"I was super sad with this Papa Johns experience. I got a great coupon (a friend provided a 50% off deal) and i was excited to take advantage. I ordered 3 pizzas online with the discount code at my lunch break around 1pm. I realized that the online order did not let customers choose a pickup time, so i quickly called the location to let them know i would not pickup until 530pm. Brook told me that it was no problem, they would be fresh by 530. I called at 525 &was surprised when the guy told me they had been \"ready for awhile\". I picked up (so jazzed at the 50% off deal) that i was not weirded out by the cashier not showing me each pizza (each was customized). The top pizza was hot, but i noticed the bottom pizza was kinda cool. When my nephew picked his slices, they were cold, the cheese congealed, the thin crust HARD/STALE-NOT CRUNCHY. I was too weirded out to call back for a remake. I just accept that if i call to make sure it will be fresh/ready when i ask IN THE 1ST PLACE, WHY WOULD I THE PLACE TO BE TRUSTWORTHY IF I CALL BACK??! Ruined any trust i had, this location is no good for the Papa Johns' name..."}
{"text":"Great service, food, and accurate timing. These guys mean business. Greeting you when you enter and when you leave. They're a well run business for sure! Will definitely return for business!!!"}
{"text":"I'm staying at a nearby hotel. I didn't get any garlic dipping sauce and the driver had no cheese or peppers to give me. Had a limp pepper in the box and some weird price of pepper... won't order again."}
{"text":"Ordered delivery- the staff was friendly and our order arrived quickly. However, our pizza seemed like it was pre-cooked and had been sitting under a warmer forever. Also ordered the chicken poppers- they too seemed like they had been sitting out awhile and did not come with the sauce we ordered."}
{"text":"Worst customer service ever.  Four hour wait for an order.  After speaking to manager Gary twice he expressed his frustration with his staff and said he was ready to quit.  Finally get our order.  Several days later we order again only to be told our address has been blocked. I asked the young lady her name and she hung up on me.   After calling the corporate office ...again twice ...to get to the bottom of this I finally get a call from Gary who proceeds to tell me that they don't deliver to my apartment complex because of safety issues (it's a nice apartment complex).  When I asked Gary how long this policy had been in place he tells me at least four months.  That is a load of lies since we have ordered at least six separate times in the last two months!  They apparently think they are the only pizza delivery in the city of Charlotte.  I also made it very clear that the objective of my call was NOT to receive free food from their company.  Simply to receive polite service, delivery as advertised and decency from their staff!  Order from anywhere but Papa Johns"}
{"text":"I ordered a pizza online and was given a time of delivery between 30-40! At that time passed, I called and it was going to be an additional 20 mins.  I have my email and phone number, and was not contacted!!!! Poor customer service"}
{"text":"had to wait over an hour for them to deliver a mile down the road. not worth it for the quality of service and pizza received. would not recommend to anyone"}
{"text":"Horrible delivery service. I placed an order at 6:30pm and after several calls to the store checking on the status of my order I finally cancel at 8:40pm. Such a joke and very disappointing."}
{"text":"Horrible service.  Placed my order and called back 1.5 hours and canceled my order. Fifteen minutes after that the driver showed up surprised that I had canceled the order. No communication, no reorders. Well yelp requires me to choose a star so I chose one."}
{"text":"Brand new location. Clean, friendly and fast! Love me some papas pizza. Our order was pretty large, and it came out perfect. They even threw in some free \"extra\" garlic sauces ... You just can't have enough of that stuff around!  You already know you love this pizza, but make sure to add the cheese bread to start it off, and maaaaayyyybe throw in a cinnapie to close out the meal. Make sure you search google before you order, there is almost always online coupon codes out there."}
{"text":"The pizza was underdone, with a doughy crust.  It was the worst I've had in a very long time. However, the service was fast and friendly, which accounts for the 2 star rating. If it weren't for the service, I'd have rated them zero stars."}
{"text":"Not worth it. So many better places to get pizza from. Papa Johns has really gone down the drain. The only reason we ordered from them is that they are one of the few pizza places that have anchovies. What a disappointment! We had one sliver of anchovi on every slice. That's like asking for a pepperoni pizza and getting a single pepperoni on every slice. Not to mention the pizza was lukewarm."}
{"text":"Worst excuse for a Papa Johns ever. Numerous orders with underbaked pizza, completely white and doughy underneath. Started ordering it well done just to get it edible. Tonight decided to try again, ordered online and hit the well done button. All is well, I thought.   I thought wrong. It arrived bland, white and doughy, not well baked. Barely edible. I called the store to discuss it, and got major attitude from Monica, the manager on duty, who informed me that they have not gotten any complaints about it, and that it was my fault for not specifying well baked, although I had. Instead of apologizing, as a good customer service manager would have done, she instructed me to go back and look at my online order via email. I told her I didn't know that people prefer doughy pizza that they have to cook on their griddle at home. Never had a manager be so rude, even when I said that I guess the days of the customer is always right are no more.   If you like rude managers and underdone pizza, this is your place. Otherwise, spend more and get something edible elsewhere."}
{"text":"Thats too bad everyone had such a lousy experience w this paps's. . Ive never had an issues with my pizza's or any delivery issues. If u dont get a special deal, then it id way too expensive. . $12 bucks for 1 medium pizza.. w just ove topping? Eff that!, had my freebie piizza which made my day! Ordered another +cheese and garlic knots. Everything was delicious."}
{"text":"Delivery was nearly 30 minutes later than the estimate given. Guy claimed to have not been given our gate code when I put it right on the online order. He was a nice guy though so an extra star for him.  Garlic butter sauce was spilled ALL over the garlic knot box which leaked through to the pizza box. (See pic. Thats when we first opened it)    Super disappointed."}
{"text":"Ordered a pizza. Was told 20mins. Got called 25mins later stating my order was wrong. 25mins after, pizza guy knocked on my door after stating DO NOT KNOCK CALL. Specified this to the girl on the phone.  Not only was it 30 mins later. (50mins to my door not 20) they screw up again by knocking. No wonder everyone in Henderson goes to papa Murphys.  They cant get an order right Drivers cant read"}
{"text":"They are horrible!!! They don't honor their coupons that they Email their customers and the manager is so unprofessional and rude. He rolled his eyes at me when i showed him the email i got. If you dont want to deal with that do not order pizza from that place"}
{"text":"I've ordered from this location many times with no issue. Of course, the one weekend I'm ordering pizza because I have guests over, my order is messed up. I partially take the blame for not double checking the box before I walked out. I ordered a Pepperoni pizza, The Works pizza & a large cheese stick. My quoted pick-up time was 15-25 minutes, it probably took about 30-35. No big deal. When she handed me my order, I checked the stickers on each box of the contents, and assumed since the stickers were correct, so was the pizza.   When I get home, I open the box labeled 'The Works' only to find the literal exact opposite: A plain cheese pizza. The cheese sticks and pepperoni were both correct. I called the location and the phone operator said \"oh, we were wondering where this extra Works Pizza was supposed to go\". I didn't feel like driving back again, so they gave me a credit for a free large pizza next time I order from there. The phone operator was very nice and apologetic."}
{"text":"The papa has outdone himself this time. I ordered a couple of pizza pies and sodie pops and it came Jimmy John's quick! John, I don't know what to say but I'm flabbergasted at all of these other reviews. If you don't like Papa John's you're just a sick monster with a horrible opinion. Would rate 10 stars outta 5 if I could."}
{"text":"This location is ALWAYS late with delivery. Last time I waited an hour. I received an email fr general manager apologizing forage service and saying they wanted to fix it. I replied to the email, and have nothing since. I'm just going eliminate them from my pizza options all together. So disappointed bc I like the food...but it's sooooo not worth it."}
{"text":"No complaints here! Papa John's is one chain I can agree with. Their pizza in my experience has always been fresh, delicious, and satisfying.   The service at this location was a little slow, probably due to the high volume of orders. It was Customer Appreciation Day after all, which means a large one-topping pizza for 5 bucks! So, the long line was to be expected."}
{"text":"Pizza was undercooked and the staff expected me to tip on carryout. Won't be going back to this location."}
{"text":"Was really pleased when I was called this evening and Jordan the manager was on the line, unfortunately he was calling to let me know an item we ordered was 86'd- totally get it the chicken poppers are yum! He was very nice and offered a solution to this and helped edit my order instead of just arriving with just the pizza. Totally professional and great forward thinking! I'm not even mad that I'm not getting what I originally ordered! Thank you!"}
{"text":"Excellent pizza with unique garlic sauce. Wish they start halal options soon. Quality of pizza is always good. Also their cheesy garlic bread is too good"}
{"text":"VERY POOR SERVICE! staff laughed at me when I asked about their topins it was clear to me that he was frustrated working alone while the other guy deliver..This dude got an serious issues he definitely need more training!"}
{"text":"I've had pizza from this location at Papa Johns twice and it was very disappointing both times, don't bother! The pizza was too doughey and there was not enough of the toppings that we had ordered plus the chicken wings were all skin and fat. They forgot to bring the extra sauces that we had ordered! I would never order from Papa Johns again!"}
{"text":"Worst customer service! After waiting close to 2 hours for one pizza, I waited an additional 10 minutes on hold when calling to find out what was going on with my order. I hang up and then call back. A different person answers and asks to put me on hold...I tell her no. She says there are multiple lines ahead of me and that she is there alone making pizzas. I said \"miss, you're not alone. Another guy answered the phone ten minutes ago.\" She said current wait time was an hour to an hour and a half. I said its been almost two hours to which she replied she was sure my order was on its way. I said check please to which she said she did and that its on its way. And then added they are really busy because of school lunches. I said \"not my problem miss. If you can't handle the volume, don't take it on.\" Pizza is still not here btw...don't use this store!!!"}
{"text":"What i like about papa johns is their dough is always fresh and never frozen. I order from papa johns when i have enough money."}
{"text":"Long windy recorded advertisement but no one answered the phone after listening to it for five minutes.  Should have broadcast a different recorded message If closed or out of business."}
{"text":"Today was my breaking point in the terrible service at this location. I ordered a small pizza at approximately 1:10pm. By 2:30 I had still not seen or heard from them. I called the location to see what the hold up was. I provided my address (which is 3 miles away) and was told there was never and order placed. I was then told estimated delivery time was 1.5 hours \"because of the rain.\" I could walk there and back in that amount of time. I then checked my bank account, (notification from my android) and found that my charge had been reversed. So they were to lazy to drive 3 miles on a Sunday. By the way: there was no rain at the quoted time. There were clouds to the north west, bit roughly 30 miles out."}
{"text":"So no where on their site when I was ordering did it state I couldn't pay with a $50 bill and when the delivery driver showed up he was very rude about the situation and told me \"you should have called and spoke to the manager if you wanted to pay with a large bill so how else will you pay\" and I explained to him that's all the money I had so he just took my food and left. Then upon calling the store they told me that's their policy. I understand it's your policy, but that should be stated. Not to mention, that gives no excuse for the driver being rude about it. I never thought I could feel embarrassed for having TOO MUCH MONEY for something, but I was wrong!!!"}
{"text":"I have been going here for almost a year and the past two deliveries have not gone well. Last week the driver couldn't find my condo. When you first pull in there's a map right there or he could've called. Delivery was over an hour and I live 2 miles away. Tonight though was bad. 45 min wait wasn't too bad but when the driver showed up she didn't have my garlic knots in the order. She said she would go look in her car. 10 minutes later I go out and check and she's gone. So I call and dude answers and tells me that she called it in and he would be bringing them out in 20-30 minutes. Absurd!!! When my garlic knots finally arrive they're cold and a complete mess. I think it might be time to go back to dominoes"}
{"text":"Come on guys!!! 1st off.... App sucks!  After placing my order it advised that my order would be delivered in 40 to 50 minutes... no problem..... Problem was....... I have 2 hungry 8 year old boys bugging me for food and it doesn't arrive until after 90 minutes (How does it take 30 minutes to \"Box\" pizzas?). Not to my surprise, it arrives cold, stale and lacked toppings. $30 for 2 pizzas and a small box of brownies?  Getting real tired of underperforming pizza delivery businesses.... I'm now convinced they ALL suck!"}
{"text":"3460 E Sunset RD; Suite U, Las Vegas, NV 89120. (6-6-16)  FUCKING NASTIEST EMPLOYEE I'VE EVER COME ACROSS & THE WORST EXPERIENCE I HAVE EVER HAD. Our company has ordered from Papa John's EVERY Monday for the past 6 months. Buying AT LEAST $30 worth every time.. UP TO even $70 sometimes! Today (6-6-16 @ 11:30AM) we ordered ONE pizza & wings for delivery. OUR TOTAL WAS BASICALLY $30. ($29.80) I wrote in the \"comments\" to please bring change, as my employer was paying cash & only had a $50 bill today. Someone called me from the store, informed me the drivers are not allowed to carry more than $20 change. Understandable. So, while on the phone I offered to pay with an AMEX. The guy couldn't find the manual entry screen or was having SOME kind of difficulty (& it sure as hell WASN'T because of a busy store) but ended up placing me on hold. FOR 6 minutes!!!!!!!!! I hung up & called back. He answered right away. FRUSTRATED-- but I asked him NICELY to put the order through & instead, I would come in with the $50 bill & CARRY OUT THE ORDER. He thanked me (mercifully) & said he would put the order through. GREAT, AWESOME, NO BIG DEAL. They're right down the road.... SO I gave them 10-15 mins to make the small order & took my own time FROM BEING AT WORK & hopped in my car to get lunch for the office. I show up, walk inside. NO ONE TO BE SEEN. NOT ONE SOUL. Found it odd, but I wait patiently. 3 minutes goes by-- I AM STANDING LIKE AN IDIOT at the front. I am pretty much STARING AT my order, (& THE ONLY ONE) on the rack. NO greeting yet, still. NO \"Hello!\", NO \"Be right there!\", NO \"Just one moment!\" NO ACKNOWLEDGEMENT WHATSOEVER that I had stepped foot into the store... for now, 5 minutes. SO I did a soft whistle. (Doubted it, but MAYBE someone really hadn't seen me??) I hear from the back office \"Hold on, just a sec!\" ????? Didn't really have a choice..... So I waited at the front register for someone to emerge. ANOTHER 3 minutes of silence goes by. SO NOW, I HAVE BEEN SITTING AT THE FRONT FOR ABOUT 10mins (watching our pizza & wings getting cold on the rack) & that I am away from work. A guy pops out from the back office. I would call him a gentleman, but he wasn't. He was dirty. NASTY. GROSS. Hair, nails, uniform, appearance, teeth. Everything about him; DISGUSTING. He says to me \"You have a pick up?\". (Regrettably at this point) I replied \"Yes.\" He sees the $50 I had waiting with me, in my hand. \"Oh we can't-- break that, like.. we're not allowed to break that.\" I STARED AT HIM IN AWE. WHAT. IS. HAPPENING. How hard does this have to BE?! I had just spoke with a male maybe 12 minutes (plus my wait time IN STORE) EARLIER. So, I asked him, \"Are YOU the person I just talked to on the phone?\" He claimed \"No, that was my driver...\". I said \" I JUST TOLD SOMEONE that I would be here in 10-15mins with a $50 bill to carry this out, & he said ok.\" He repeated AGAIN that he wasn't going to/can't break the bill. ALL I COULD DO WAS STARE. I CANNOT GET A GRIP ON THIS. I understand drivers not being able to carry change over $20....  BUT THE FUCKING STORE?!? Papa John's Pizza is worth 600 MILLION dollars. 600. MILLION. DOLLARS. & HE CAN'T BREAK A $50 BILL FOR A $30 ORDER from the register?!??!?!?!??!?!??!?!?! Fucking ridiculous. NEVER AGAIN. NEVER, AGAIN WILL I GIVE OR LET ANYONE ELSE I KNOW GIVE ONE DOLLAR TO PAPA JOHN'S AGAIN. WORD OF MOUTH IS POWERFUL.  If I was a scumbag, I could have easily TAKEN MY ORDER along with some other items by the time he came out from doing WHATEVER he was doing back there. MAKES ME SICK TO THINK THAT GUY WAS MAKING/HANDLING THE PIZZA (OR ANY FOOD FOR THAT MATTER) THAT WE HAVE BEEN CONSUMING FOR THE PAST HALF OF YEAR."}
{"text":"Great pizza and the guys at this location were so polite and nice.  We only ordered a cheese pizza but it was so delicious."}
{"text":"This place is delicious but way over priced. Personal pizza is $8! A personal pizza with soda and bread sticks. .. $8! Seriously?"}
{"text":"Honestly, this is the best papa johns I've had ever. Looking at past reviews must mean either they have new management or new staff. I love this papa johns!!"}
{"text":"After calling Papa Johns on Springfield and them constantly ignoring or not taking our order we called Papa johns on green street and Ashley was able to accomodate us right away. Thank you ASHLEY!! Great customer service!!!! Will not be ordering from papa johns on springfield again... Papa Johns on Green Street all the way!!"}
{"text":"We tried to call and order pizza they would not take our order after talking to the store on Green Street they accommodated us even though we were not in their delivery area. I would not order from this Papa johns again."}
{"text":"Half off my order and the impending game 7 of the NBA finals led me to order from Papa. Pretty surprising results as we went with the Hawaiian BBQ Chicken Pizza, pretty much the standard BBQ chicken with pineapple added. Should have got it well done, but somehow all the ingredients worked. Added on a $3.99 cinnapie and damn this thing was greasy, but good. Loaded with crumbly topping and lots of cinnamon, it was a worthy desert for this sort of place. Pizza here in about 20 minutes and nice delivery dude as well. Register online and then you will get all the deals."}
{"text":"This place gave me food poisoning.  An hour after I ate. My stomach started hurting and then as I suspected. Bathroom time. Smh. The pizza LOOKED soooo good. I can't believe it was contaminated. Please guys WASH your hands and practice better FOOD handling skills!!"}
{"text":"Make sure you zero out the  tip area on your credit card slip when Papa Johns delivers ( used to be camfield corners now relocated to Johnston rd.. )  .... 2 times now... someone between HERE & THERE added a tip to my debit card  purchase after getting a CASH tip too.... I finally think hubby learned a lesson... !!!  Papa Johns offered us a couple free pizzas to rectify the situation.... ummmm NO..... a 5 year customer has been LOST ....and Hungry Howies has gained a NEW customer !"}
{"text":"when it's time for our weekly 'don't want to cook' delivered meal, pizza is an option always ordered via iPhone from our local papa johns..  we're always happy with our order and the great deals that papa john's has to offer.  the deals always please.  we love: bbq chicken hawaiian bbq chicken and the works.. [my personal fav]  everything tastes freshly baked.. it's still nice and hot when it gets to our house..  and the wings are great too.  the crust is the best!  :D"}
{"text":"The unethical behavior is ridiculous. I walked into this location and as I was opening the door the cashier look at me in the face,  laugh and walked away to pretend that he was busy with a pencil.  Seriously?  So this was on our second time visiting this location because when I originally picked up my order they forgot to provide me with everything that i had paid for.  I called and was informed that i could stop by, pick up the purchased product, and to compensate for the inconvenience they would give me a free two litter of soda. So I drove all the way back later and was greeted with the nonsense as other employees were laughing at the cashiers behavior. I picked up my purchased product and didn't even bother with the free soda. If rather drive 10 miles than to continue giving this location ANY of my money.  Sorry franchise owner,  you just lost this customer and any referrals that could have been sent your way.  I wouldn't want my friends or family treated like this."}
{"text":"I thought this Papa Johns had great service and the pizza was excellent."}
{"text":"The best pizza around this area compared to other pizza places, my son only ate at papa john's pizza, it cost a little bit more and one important that he enjoyed it! I try some and it okay for me, but it wasn't my favorite, anyway I gave them five stars because my son love them pizza! Accordingly of my son that he highly recommended!"}
{"text":"My brother and I walked in to order pizza.  We stood patiently for about 7 minutes and not one employee came over to help us or even acknowledge us.  It is fine if they were busy, but professional restaurants should greet their customers as they walk through their front door, or at least acknowledge their customers and let them know that they \"will be right with them.\"  When they are no longer busy, they need to apologize to each customer for the wait.  It was like we were invisible.   One young lady was at the front of the store, but kept on going with her personal conversation on her cell phone even with customers (4 of us total) waiting in the front. We finally lost our patience and exited the restaurant.  They should fire their staff and store manager and start over and make sure to train employees better.  Stay away from this PJ's location, far far away.  I want to give this PJ location a zero star rating as deserved, but too bad it is not available."}
{"text":"Their drivers always speed through the parking lot and take up all the spots near the door.  Use the backdoor!  Today I saw a delivery driver WALK out the door carrying pizzas in both hands parked in the handicapped spot.  He did have a tag so either he's using someone else's tag or its his and he shouldn't have one."}
{"text":"Found hair baked into the pizza, in the cheese. So disgusting!!! When I called in the said they would void the transaction and refund my money which is good. But they didn't apologize and said it was from one of the cooking utensils. Which is impossible was a light brown/blonde hair so I don't see how that could be, but whatever. I definitely won't be ordering from them again, I'm literally sick to my stomach :(."}
{"text":"About a month ago I ordered from the Papa John's app with no issues. This time was an absolute nightmare. I ordered a special for a large pizza with 3 toppings and it came with cinnamon pull apart bread for $14.99. I added a Sierra Mist and an extra garlic sauce. I realized after about 35 minutes I did not receive a confirmation and that's right about when it came through. On the confirmation it showed just the soda and a sauce for roughly 8 bucks after a delivery. I thought this was weird and then the driver showed up a few minutes later with only those things. He tells me that they all thought it was an odd order at the store but no one decided to call us to confirm. We call and get the manager. I don't recall her name. This was roughly 6:30 on Wednesday evening 12/7. She basically said she could discount the pizza to 8.99 but then charge full price for the cinnamon bread and we have to repay the delivery fee. After politely trying to resolve this I became very annoyed at her lack of caring for the inconvenience. She stated it isn't the store's fault and a fault with the app. I told her it was still up to her as a manager to make it right. Not once did she offer to try to find a different promotion and maybe discount that to the original price. She basically stated it was out of her hands and there was nothing she could do. We then called to make a complaint to that store which I informed her I would be doing and she really didn't care about that either. Now we are waiting for a call back from the owner or DM to see about a refund or whatever else. This location is terrible. Order elsewhere."}
{"text":"We've ordered from this location for over five years. Last time we ordered the pizza came extremely doughy and 15 minutes late. I called and spoke with a manager to let them know. I trusted he would work on improving quality. Today we ordered the same order again and the pizza was doughy again...and this time 20 minutes late. Pizzas are coming not just a little doughy but very slimy and raw kind of doughy. Disgusting! We can't even eat it. I just wanted to tell the manager about the problem and he had an attitude and was very rude, he insisted on my information and I simply wanted to give my feedback anonymously. He kept talking over me demanding my info... I asked for the store managers name and he said he refuses to cooperate with me and hung up on me. I'm floored!! I will NEVER order from this store again! Management should no doubt be fired! If the store manager or owner reads this....you want results, start at the TOP! Either the employees aren't being trained properly or just don't care at all. Either way, management should be competent enough to handle the problem. And how he spoke to me...very unprofessional and disgraceful. Done! Lost our business!"}
{"text":"I've ordered from them a few times . When I picked up the food was considerably better . The delivery was awful . The pizza was barely warm and wasn't cooked all the way . It was really gross . I had to cook it in the oven longer for it to be done ! So I was disappointed . The upside is they always have really good coupons available and always have deals . As a college student it's a plus that the pizza is cheap .   The ones in the Chicagoland area trade way better ! So I'm not sure if it's just this location or what but I'm not sure if I will order again from this location ."}
{"text":"I saw all the bad reviews on here so I decided I needed to put my two cents in! I recently moved here to Champaign from Peoria and finding my favorite to-go food places was a bit of a struggle. This is the only Papa Johns that delivers to the apartment complex I live in so one night I decided to try it out.  Ever since then, me and my husband have been ordering from this Papa Johns at least three times a month. They always quote us a delivery time of 30-40 minutes and always show up within 25 minutes EVERY TIME! It's always a pleasant surprise when they come knocking on the door earlier than expected (mind you, we don't live super close to this store, it's about an 8 minute drive with no traffic) and the delivery boys are always so friendly! We have only ever had one issue with this store, our online order didn't go through correctly so we ended up with a pizza that we actually ordered 2 days earlier. The delivery guy called us so I apologized and told him that we weren't home and that there must have been a problem with our order . I then called the store 5 minutes later to make sure they refunded me because I was expecting there to be an issue with the refund (you know how some places can be not so eager to refund something that was a customer's mistake) and when the manager picked up, she had already taken care of the refund. I was so surprised that there was no issue at all! So to sum it all up...this is honestly the best pizza place in the area...at least in our experience!! Every time we order from a different pizza place, we are always disappointed and say \"We should have gotten Papa Johns!\""}
{"text":"Am I really reviewing Papa John's? Yep, looks like Im am.  I am a food nut. Magnified by 100 when it comes to pizza.  Its no secret Im a NY STYLE guy. The best thing about PJ's is unlike most others, they dont claim to be something they are not. Most pizza places, even the large chains, love advertising 'NY STYLE', when they arent remotely close to a NY Pie.  Mainly ordered here last night due to time constraints, as well as the fact the younger kids simply do not appreciate a good NY Pie and were wanting pizza. While they argued (wrong word...Discussed, is what they do) about which pizza to get, one pointed out they had a 50% off deal running.  Ding Ding, we have a winner, and Papa John's was it.  We did Carryout. An Extra Large 'The Works', Original style with extra sauce.  Again, Im a NY Pizza guy so dont expect me to get overly excited in this review.  What I will say, after the 50% off the pie was $10. It weighed alot. Dont think Ive ever gotten carryout pizza that had me wondering if I was going to find rocks inside.  Nope, just pizza. I did get xtra sauce which I normally dont like, bit did so since my experiences with PJ's left me wondering where the sauce was. Amount of sauce going xtra was just right. The flavor of the sauce was ehh...Nothing special...but not too bad...typical pizza sauce.  The pizza itself was good, again, nothing special, but not bad. Was hot when I arrived to pick it up, was hot when we got home to eat it. Didnt have much need to chat with the folks working there. Pizza was ready, so I simply paid and left. Cant say they were overly friendly, but also cant say they were rude. The did their job. Fine by me.  Pizza was cooked just fine. Would like to see more toppings tho. The works comes with 7 toppings. Many pizzas cant handle heavy toppings when it comes with 7. This extra large could easily have handled more each of the 7 toppings.   Doesnt do much good to put 7 toppings on if you only get 1 in each bite. They easily could have added more, but I digress.  Overall, when it comes to the pizza chains, I have to say this was better then most.   I good, filling pie with no issues worth mentioning. Admittedly, the 50% off deal was the kicker as for $10, it was a good pie, filling with no complaints.  only 3 stars because well, its a pizza chain. I have yet to find a true  mega chain, that deserves 4, but it certainly was better then 2, so 3 is the magic number...."}
{"text":"Guy on the phone was not friendly. Condescending and unorganized. Pizza was also not good."}
{"text":"Ordered 5 pizzas for deliver for my daughter's birthday party this last weekend.  On a busy Saturday night with a large order, I expected a wait for the delivery.  It was probably 40 minutes from submission to doorbell.   What I'd love to give a shout out for is the excellent customer service.  On the special comment line of the online line order, I asked for the driver to sing happy birthday to my daughter.  I hoped, but didn't expect they'd do it.  The delivery gal was very sweet and she did it!  my teen was properly embarrassed and loved it.  Thank you so much!"}
{"text":"I called to order a large buffalo chicken pizza with an order of 4 bread sticks and a 2-liter soda. (a special they had advertised) I requested when ordering the pizza, that it be cut in squares, not pie shaped wedges, and was informed this was \"Chicago style\", so clearly the guy understood what I was asking.   When I arrived, I made the huge mistake of not checking the pizza or bread sticks although the amount I was charged should have warned me they screwed up. I got to my office and 1) the pizza was not cut into squares, but was sloppily cut into pie shaped wedges and 2) I had a dozen bread sticks - way more than 4 according to my math. Adding more insult, there was a cobweb in the corner of the box holding my bread sticks and a teeny tiny spider dangling as I lifted the lid. Ewe!  Will I ever order from the Urbana Papa Johns again? Really? You had to ask?   Not only did they clearly NOT listen to or care about a damn thing I said on the phone when placing my order, but spiders in the boxes? I understand workers put the boxes together in their 'slow time' so they have them ready to go when they get busy, but come on.....have you heard of CLEANING?   Shut it down!"}
{"text":"We ordered two pizzas, one cheese and one with pepperoni.  We ended up with two pepperonis.  The kids were all hyped up for some delicious pizza but when we got home with the pizza nobody would eat them.  The crusts were completely black and the top crust was black and burnt.  What a waste of money.   They should have been ashamed to even send the pizza out of the store."}
{"text":"Food is hit and miss.  I know I should stick to thin crust when I order from here.  I ordered a pepperoni normal crust which seemed undercooked as well as cheese sticks that were dried out.  It is getting a three due to the occasional hits and what can you expect from a chain."}
{"text":"Been here dozens of times over the past few years and they always fast friendly and delicious, what more could you want?"}
{"text":"Placed an order over the phone for delivery. They said they'd get here 45 - 60 minutes. Over an hour later, we called to check the status of the order and they said \"We don't deliver that far. We tried to call you.\" They did NOT call us to let us know they cancelled our order. Beware."}
{"text":"Have been ordering from this location for sometime now, and the most recent experience put me over the edge.  Have had a couple issues in the past with online ordering and picking up, problems with credit card verification on their end and incorrect orders etc, ... but nothing to stop me from going.  UNTIL  With my most recent online delivery order I made a pizza half and half, only to notice that something was confusing with their summary.  I called to verify, and they confirmed my order.  However when it showed, half was incorrect.  I called to have another sent and Heather told me that there would be one on the way. Within 5 mins I received a call from the manager (can't remember her name).  I figured it would be to go over things, however without any hesitation she instructed me to have the pizza ready to switch out saying that she would not have the other pizza delivered otherwise.  At first I agreed to this strange request, but then after a seconds thought told her I found it strange that with their mistake I would have to wait an additional 30 mins just to switch it out. She blamed recent issues with people wanting free pizza, and I didn't see how this applied to my situation when it was their mistake. She then said to only put back the half that was incorrect, but at this point I was over it.  After getting off the phone, I decided to call back and tell them to cancel the redo, we ordered Dominos instead."}
{"text":"Awful management and service!  I placed an online order and it was going to take 95 minutes, I called to confirm and they said they had only one delivery driver working!  They did not offer any type of compensation for future order, I will never order again.  Dominoes and Pizza Hut are far better options! Wayne Gorsek"}
{"text":"The pizza really gives Pizza Nova a run for its money. The sauce is not too salty and they load the pie up with pepperoni. The dough is chewy and although the texture isn't entirely of my liking, I did enjoy the taste; especially when using the special garlic dipping sauce. There is a hint of garlic flavour, slightly watered down but leaves a creamy/buttery aftertaste which I thought was excellent. The only con is pizza overall is quite greasy; comparable to Pizza Hut. You might want a thick napkin handy. I highly recommend this place for people who are bored with Canadian pizza chains and just want to try something new.  UPDATE: I still come here regularly but the Customer Service has sharply gone down since my first visit. Staff have a lot of problems multitasking and keeping track of customers. A real hit and miss. Most recently one staff member served someone who ordered before me when I was sat down and patiently waiting in clear sight. Very embarassing and I hope they straighten up their staff. You've been relegated from \"Yay!\" to a borderline \"A-OK.\""}
{"text":"Politics aside, I like Papa John's ok enough. They usually always have some kind of deal, so I certainly can appreciate that. And their buffalo chicken pizza in particular sure is tasty. And their garlic dipping sauce just makes the pizza oh so much better. It's nothing gourmet, but it'll satisfy that too-lazy-to-leave-the-house-but-I-need-some-pizza-now craving. My orders have always arrived within the given timeframe and have always been correct. And the delivery staff have always been friendly. I'm not sure there's much more you can ask of a national pizza chain."}
{"text":"I love Papa Johns and it's yummy garlic sauce.  I am so happy to see you as a partner of Bike MS! Thank you for your dedication to ending MS"}
{"text":"Not very good.  They don't cook the dough all the way.  The staff is not that friendly.  The parking lot is very small and hard to get in and out of."}
{"text":"First off, the parking for this particular location is pretty awful. There's only 3 awkwardly placed spots in the front of this store, and there's a hotel to the right of it.  I had a coupon for a free small cheese pizza (carryout only), so of course I took advantage of it -- I've always been a fan of Papa John's. The person I ordered from said that it was going to take about 15 minutes, but it probably was closer to 10 minutes, so not bad~ The pizza itself was good; I found no faults with it. However, the pepperoncinis that were put inside my pizza box were really dry and inedible. I'd rather they not put it in at all if that was going to be the case."}
{"text":"The other day, I was craving some Papa John's Pizza. There isn't one in Anthem, so I called the closest one, 12 miles away. When I asked if they deliver to Anthem, I didn't get a \"no\".  Instead, the manager asked the owner, Matt, to see if he'd make an exception. He not only said he'd do it, but he let me place a small order, use coupon codes, and delivered it himself.  That is A++ service in my book!"}
{"text":"Took over an hour to get our order asked for plates and napkins never received them asked the driver why we he didn't bring napkins and he said that they ran out of napkins and then we asked about plates and he said \"idk why i didn't bring the plates\" and we let it slide keep in mind this was there second attempt at getting our order correct the first time it took 1 and half hours and the food was room temp and non edible unless we put it in stove we called and asked what the hold up was and he said \"we have a new driver and he just did something very stupid by taking on more deliveries then he could handle\" but the part that kills me was the way they cut our pizza it is almost comical lol we asked for square cut and if you look at the pic i posted you will see what we got lol overall we are pretty disappointed also my wife is 8 months pregnant and was craving good pizza and got a mouth full of disillusioned tasteless room temperature pizza that even or dog turned his nose too on and empty stomach lets just say i wont be ordering again unless im up for a good laugh after ive had a couple drinks. I wouldn't recommend ordering here unless you enjoy lukewarm pizza cut in squares by Stevie wonder...."}
{"text":"I am not a huge Papa John's person. I can say though, the food from this location was not bad at all. The pizza was really good for Papa Johns and we tried the chicken bites and I really enjoyed them.   If you are a Papa John's fan I don't see this location being a let down. On the flip side, I am not a Papa John's fan and this location wasn't a let down. I am sticking with three stars though due to the fact that it was still Papa John's."}
{"text":"The worst pizza i have ever eaten. I must apologize to little caesars I've been telling people for years that little caesars was the worst. If you need a laxative don't go to the drug store just go to papa johns ."}
{"text":"We ordered our large cheese, sausage pizza thin crust went to pick it up ourselves, but got pizza home it was covered in onions stinky stinky stinky puke. Callef them got another Pizza waited another half hour they delivered felt sorry for the delivery boy so we gave him a tip, otherwise the pizza was good too bad the people aren't better trained."}
{"text":"Took over an hour to get this order from this location for just a pizza and breadsticks..over 20 bucks. When the order finally did arrive, it was completely cold and had to reheat in the microwave. The bread sticks were very doughey and looked horrible. There was no bacon on several slices of the pizza even though this was extra bacon/extra pepporoni pizza. I called the store manager to complain and she just said there was nothing she could do for me. She would sumbit my complaint to corporate to handle. There wasn't even an apology offered by her for this invonvenience. I would never order from this store location ever again. Customer service is very poor as is their delivery speed and product. Please go elsewhere."}
{"text":"This is my first and most likely only review I will ever write, but my experience was so upsetting I couldn't not write about it. This is for the girl with the large built, red hair and scar on her face. She did not welcome us, did not help us with our order (there was confusion over whether my boyfriend ordered under his full name or nickname), said there were no eatCU orders (not true), all she did was shrug and it was clear she just wanted us to leave. She kept shrugging and giving us SO MUCH attitude and it was upsetting that she didn't even care to help us. Sure it's a shitty job but you don't have to take it out on others :( Thankfully things were figured out by the manager but I do not ever want to go back if that same girl would give us service again."}
{"text":"Ordered on the app and it was super easy. Did not check the closing time for delivery and ordered at 10:58pm without thinking. I work at a restaurant and I know how crappy it is to be closing and have someone come in or try and order when you're pretty much cleaned up, so on that note, super sorry about that. But thank you so much to the folks at this papa John's because it's 11:33pm and they just delivered my pizza even though they stop deliveries/close at 11. Thank you so so much the pizza was delicious as always."}
{"text":"We always order the Buffalo Chicken Pizza, thin crust with grilled chicken and I think its fair to say that on at least 5 occasions they have screwed it up. Not rocket science...we are done. Call someone else."}
{"text":"I feel really bad for papa John's ... this location should get new staff asap .  Last week - half my order was missing . Wings under cooked . Total time 1 hour and 45 mins   Today it's been over an hour and still not here . Called to asked if they forgot about the order and the girl said it was in its way ... but as everyone knows - pizza places just don't give a fuck and it was clearly obvious by the tone of her voice .  Sad moment for papa John's fans lol   This will be my last order - and hope it eventually gets here !  #lostpizza   *** pizza was delivered - but the wrong pizza . My pizza is still lost :/"}
{"text":"Ordered a pizza online with the Brewers deal. Made a mistake and was able to call and change it after speaking to a very friendly, accommodating staff member. Food was ready on time, retrieved by a friendly staff member, and suited my tastes. Will return."}
{"text":"On 6/3/18, late evening. I tried to order food for delivery.  Only to find out it would take 2 hours to receive food. So i called papa johns to change it to carry out instead if delivery.  When i got there i noticed 2 delivery drivers were there. But was told it would take 2 hours to get my pizza. When i am less than 2 blocks from the pizza place. This was more than ridiculous.  This place has some serious issues."}
{"text":"Cameron is the manager. He is thebomb.com. I had a problem with a pizza a couple times ago. I ordered extra cheese and it looked like normal amount cheese once it arrived. Gave the store a call, he gave me a free pizza for the trouble on my next order.  When I ordered it the next time, it was absolutely perfect because Cam put a note in the computer about it. When I ordered this time, I called after placing the mobile order just to make sure they actually put a legit amount of cheese on it so I could avoid any problems like the first time. Guess who answered? Cameron. Guess who said he remembered my name and already took care of it? Cameron. What. A. Boss.  ! Oh, and their delivery guys are so fast and so nice. We had Keith tonight. Our pizza was here in 25 minutes. Boom! Happy customer alert! And btw, I'm adding a picture of these cheesy goodness so you see what you get when you pay for extra cheese and Cameron is on the job."}
{"text":"Done with Papa Johns. ... Driver got lost.. Opened pizza no garlic sauce or parmesan.. Called store...what? No garlic sauce or peppers with thin crust...only reason we chose them over another delivery was garlic sauce... ????"}
{"text":"This location has constantly messed up my order and forgotten my extra sauces. Last time I ordered 3 extra garlic sauces and they forgot them all. I let it slide because I thought it was just a mistake but this happened the second time and now a third time. I only continue to order from this place because of its location. Sad."}
{"text":"placed my order at 9:01pm. showed up to the store at 9.06pm. food was out at 9:15pm. can't beat that! nice work guys."}
{"text":"Papa John himself would be disappointed in the level of quality in the pizza's (3) that I received on 08/03/2013. I placed an order online from the 1010 E Desert Inn Rd. location for the special that they had for 3 medium/ 3 topping pizza's thinking that I will do something special for my wife, since she didn't eat anything at work. This was my first time I ever ate Papa John's. Everything was great when ordering and the delivery driver calling to let me know that she is 10 minutes away. When she arrive at our hotel at 7:20PM, I gave her a tip and accepted the pizza's without ever looking at them. As soon as I sat down with my wife in our hotel room, we looked at the pizza's and it looked like the pizza's were cold (cheese getting firm as if it were sitting out long). I called the Papa John's location and spoke with the manager around 7:30PM. He had offered to get new ones sent. I called back at 7:42PM asking the manager if we should give the old pizza's back to the driver that is coming to drop of the new pizza's, he then said that we didn't need to. So my wife and I were so hungry and waited for the pizza's to arrive. We had the opportunity to stare at the cold pizza's and realized how skimpy the toppings were and one of the pizza's looked burnt on the bottom. One pizza for example, had anchovies, chicken and onions. We couldn't even see the chicken and onions, so it looked like an anchovy pizza. I had time to take nice pictures of them. I called the Papa John's location again around 8:32PM. I was so upset that we haven't received the pizza's yet. They said that the driver went to the wrong address and should be there shortly and that the pizza's were piping hot out of the oven. I doubt that they were piping hot, especially arriving late. At 8:44PM, the driver called me and said that he was outside the hotel. I told him to send the pizza's back because it was late already, one hour and 14 minutes later from the time that I called at 7:30PM to get the replacement pizza's. I filled out a feedback form online at the Papa John's website the same night. It is already 08/07/13 and I still haven't received a call from who ever it may concern. I am sorry, but the way that Papa John talks about his business is different from what I experienced. The quality presented by his employee's do not match up to what his values are. I can't say that there were better ingredients if there were hardly any topping on the pizza's."}
{"text":"Always good pizza, fast delivery, outstanding quality compared to all others that deliver. Thanks for great service."}
{"text":"I would describe the pizza I had as Pizza Hut meats Pizza Pizza.  The crust is nice and think, fluffy, not hard. I like the added hot peppers on the side for a nice touch."}
{"text":"The pizza is excellent  last time, I was there 3 pizzas for 75 dollars I was like I never so much for pizza.Once a month is ok"}
{"text":"The first time I ordered was 6 months ago and I live in a brand new community so they never showed up!! I called back and they said the address was not valid so they didn't deliver or call! I gave them turn by turn directions and got a cold pizza! I called my bank and canceled the order cause even though they said they wouldn't they charged my card! Fast forward to today I tried to give them a second chance ordered my garlic knots got them with no garlic topping on them, so just plain bread! Lol, but I did get ranch! So I called back they delivered garlic knots with marinara no ranch like I ordered! I only went over the order with the manager Carlos 3 times?!?! How could they get it wrong?? Really!?!"}
{"text":"I'm stretching it, giving this location 2 stars. The pizza is OK, but they DON'T honor Papa Johns special deals that are advertised locally. A real negative."}
{"text":"This location is so awful I deleted the app from my phone because I'll never have a need to order from them again. It takes them at least an hour to deliver a pizza, by the time it gets in my hands it's cold, and paying for extra toppings is useless because they always skimp on them. There are other low level pizza restaurants to order from, and those places at least get orders right and delivered on time."}
{"text":"I ordered a pizza a month ago that took 3 hours to deliver. I was sent a come-back-customer coupon in the mail to get my business back. I ordered another pizza, thinking it was a previous fluke. It has now been an hour and twenty minutes and I have called several times and they keep saying it is on the way. I live less than ten minutes from this restaurant. Seriously, if this store wants to continue business then perhaps they need to fix their delivery system since it is atrocious."}
{"text":"Best papa john's pizza I've ever had!!! Deliver was less then 30 minutes and the pizza was so hot it almost burned my mouth! The driver that delivered my pizza was funny and outgoing and I def recommend ordering from this Papa John's every time"}
{"text":"Ordered a large pizza, staff was nice and very prompt delivery to the inn. Quality was good and had a good taste! I'd eat it again for sure."}
{"text":"They say you get what you pay for this is a prime example. Cheap pizza cheap toppings. Gave them two tries and just taste cheap."}
{"text":"Can't complain. I've ordered online, and over the phone (when website was down). I always get just what I ordered sooner or right on time, as provided by the ETA."}
{"text":"I had a birthday party planned for my daughter's 17th birthday and scheduled a future delivery for the afternoon. Due to some computer glitch the ticket printed and they delivered the pizzas 3 hours early. Made a quick phone call to the store to report the error and they were kind enough to fix everything and deliver fresh pizzas at my originally scheduled time. I've used this location several times and the customer service always had been top notch, and this time was no different. Thank you guys for taking such good care of us."}
{"text":"I ordered a cheese pizza and it was good I also ordered 1 cheese stick but it was 1 box and 8 Cheese sticks."}
{"text":"Dissatisfied customer!!! The workers are completely disrespectful, rude, they seem very unhappy, not welcoming, unclean, unprofessional, and pure distasteful. The little Caucasian girl was rude over the phone and very unprofessional when my boyfriend and I arrived to the business. She was standing near the cash register texting on her phone, didn't greet us or anything, then had the nerves to put her phone in her pocket and began making pizzas with her bare hands. She didn't wash her hands after texting on her phone nor did she use hand sanitizer or gloves. Phones have the worst germs ever!!!! I mentioned it to the manager who happened to be standing right there (Keshanee) and all she said was \" Go wash your hands now\" the girl washed her hands and continued working on the same dirty pizza. I would have been ok if the manager would have made her throw the pizza away, wash her hands, then start a new pizza. I am a registered nurse and I am always washing my hands or using hand sanitizer because I'm worried about the safety of myself and others. This is one of the worst experiences ever. I felt like there was pure animosity in this place... Every employee was walking around with frowns and bad attitudes. I would not recommend this place to no one."}
{"text":"DO NOT ORDER FROM THIS LOCATION!!!! The DM (district manager) doesn't give a crap about customers. Our last 3 orders were missing sides we paid extra for and i vowed to never order from them again. Unfortunately my wife was craving the chicken Alfredo pizza so reluctantly I ordered it NO SHOCKER ORDER WRONG AGAIN! Papa John's your dead to this household well forever stick, from this point on, with us pizza and Lucky's! Good riddance fools pizza was mediocre at best in a pinch now it doesn't even measure up to pizza u get at target, great business plan!"}
{"text":"Never again will I return to Papa Johns - not only was the food horrible but this isn't the first time the food was below good. The pizza we got tasted old, like it was pulled from the frig and placed in the oven. Among other things, my wife placed a order and used her credit it card and I was to pick it up, when I got there the manage asked for the card. Luckily I had it, but the last name on her card hasn't been changed yet. Keep in mind when I called, the call taker said it wouldn't be a problem. Well there was a problem - Vince the store manage was less then nice to me. I should have walked out but instead, used my card for the food. The manage was rude and not understanding and proceeded to tell me if I used the card on line, he wouldn't have needed to see the card - I told him that didn't make sense. Maybe it's this Papa John, I always seem to have issues with this location from my ordering being cancled at one time ( they said I called back and told them never mind) to waiting 2 hours for my pizza to arriave at my house. Never have had problems at the Pizza Hut or Marco's."}
{"text":"Great location, employees have always been super helpful and friendly, my pizza is always cooked perfectly, and delivery is always really fast!"}
{"text":"Not a huge fan of pizza chain restaurant....usuallly they're a last resort.  But for Laveen, this is mostly just chain especially for delivery.  So I like Papa John's the best: you can build it just the way you want on their website and even order ahead  of  time and specifiy a time if early enough.. 2 of 3 drivers have been right on time and very nice, and the order was accurate.  The ingreadients tasted fresh and not dried out.  the crust was tasty. Would use again!"}
{"text":"This evening was my first time ordering with Papa John's and likely my last.  I have a domino's up the street but thought I would try something new.  I ordered a vegetarian pizza, over 60 minutes ago, surpassing the 40-50 minute delivery estimate I received via email.  Furthermore I phoned the store fifteen minutes ago to inquire as to the status of my order and I was told that it was out for delivery and should arrive within 5 minutes.  My time is worth something, and had I known my order would exceed the delivery time of any competitor by at least 20-30 minutes, well, I will vote with my wallet and support elsewhere...because being hangry in not for me."}
{"text":"Of all the national chains I think Papa John's does it the best.  The only time I've ever had an issue with their pies was with a driver who must have carried the box on its side because all the topping had slid off into a ball of mess in the corner of the box.  A quick call, another 40 minute wait, and a new one was brought over with a free order of bread sticks and a 2 liter of Coke."}
{"text":"Horrible customer service! I was home sick with a sick baby & couldnt leave my house. The guy who took my order couldnt find me with my phone number I said are you sure & gave it again...still no  then he asked for my address ...after over an hour with no pizza I called only to be told that he must have entered my address wrong but that he tried to call me...MY PHONE NEVER WRANG ONCE! Lies!!! After telling me they would remake and resend ...I said no ..I asked for a manager (Dylan)he said he was ...then he hung up on me!!!! I called back to find out what was happening ..was I getting my pizza ?...was I being refunded?...why did he hang up on me? and the girl said because I was being unreasonable..I gave the baby a bath & PUT her to bed...then I called Pizza Hut ..What I should have done in the first place..got my pizza in 20 minutes easy peasy..."}
{"text":"Papa Johns Pizza  This was the place to order a cheap pizza while at college.  This place was also constantly being ripped off by students in the following fashion:  Eat half the pizza, send one of our buddies to cut one of his finger nails and bring it back to put in the pizza.  Call up Papa Johns, \"Hey man, there is a finger nail in my pizza, you need to send a new one right away\"...enter the second free pizza.  A funny story with respect to this place.  The location in Warrensville ended up shutting down and some poor unsuspecting bastard got the phone number of the former pizza shop.  So one day we call for a pizza and the guy who answered the phone sounded like he had gotten about 100 calls for pizzas.  \"Hello\" \"Yes, I'd like to order one large pepperoni pizza for delivery\" \"No man, this is now a residence\"...\"In that case how about just an order of cheese sticks\"...\"Damn it man, I says this is a RES-A-DANCE!\"  We were all laughing our asses off."}
{"text":"I placed an online order. When arriving to pick up my order, I was told it would take 5 more minutes and that my order should be right out of the oven. It actually took another 30 minutes! Way too long for a online order and a carry out!"}
{"text":"The WORST CUSTOMER SERVICE EVER. 1.5 Hours after I ordered the pizza, still nothing... Called... \"Oh we don't have the right address\" great, here's the right address,... 20 minutes later, called again... \"The driver came back because he didn't have the right phone number\". Are you kidding me? Is the damn pizza going to be hot? Never again. Don't come here. I could have gone to Papa Murphys and back 16 times and cooked each pizza by the time these guys get their act together. And the Manager I spoke to answered the phone with \" what's the issue\" really?"}
{"text":"This location never gets my order right. I've had to send back drivers because they forgot something important (like a whole pizza or two). Also, they NEVER deliver to my door. I give them a gate code, and they can get inside but never come to the door. Why am I paying for delivery when I have to walk all the way across the complex to meet the driver that can't even meet me halfway? They always forget the extra sides and sauces. This is the worst review I've ever written, but it's well deserved, as this location never delivers on time and they're lazy. So disappointing."}
{"text":"Ordering online is such a bitch!!!! And they do not offer the same specials as in store?! Makes no sense. I do love papa johns tho. The staff is nice. Better experience this last time :) I am happy to say the least!"}
{"text":"Have tried to order from this location 3 times. I have yet to get a pizza delivered! First time... called to pick up. Didn't have my name, order... nothing. 2nd on hold for 15 min. asked me my order 5 times. (Large cheese pizza) not that hard... needed up giving up. Tried again this evening. Took another 15 min to order. ?I just want a pizza... :("}
{"text":"Horrible customer service!  Tried to order 3 pizzas as a gift for a business via credit card and was told that the card holder with ID would have to be present to accept the pizzas.  The business pizzas are being delivered to is across town.  Asked if I could fax or email in the ID and CC info or any alternatives to get this done.  Manager Kaitlin was incredibly rude and offered no help.  Called Domino's and at least they went the extra mile to request approval from corporate for my situation.  Good way to lose business."}
{"text":"Never again and not because of the pizza or the delivery guy, but the poor management of the store.    We ordered on line on Thursday, Aug. 14 for delivery. Got the email stating the pizza would be here in 30-40 minutes. After 55 minutes, we called and were told it is an hour for delivery as they have only 1 driver.  Okay, but shouldn't your confirmation email state that?  I understand you get busy, I can accept that.    Our pizza arrives 15 minutes later. We pay for it and tip the driver in cash because from what we've heard from the store, its not his fault he's the only driver tonight.  Maybe someone called in sick, again not my problem but I understand.   Pizza was cold and the order was incorrect, they gave us black olives for mushrooms. We checked the email and they screwed up, no black olives on our order.  So we called back and spoke to someone who told us the manager was too busy to talk to us now. No give me your contact info and I will have him or her call you back, nothing.    So we contacted their corporate office on line. We got a response back pretty quickly apologizing for our experience and stating the store would be contacting us soon to resolve the issue.  Canned email for sure, but a response none the less.   It's been a week, we have heard nothing from this store. I guess they are still too busy to care.  We will never order from Papa John's again, none of them.  Which sort of sucks because we only have 3 options for pizza delivery where we live."}
{"text":"We order pizza here more than anywhere else nearby.  On our last order we decided to try the wings.  Well, kind of disappointed we did...  They were mostly fat and had a unappetizing mushy texture.  They were not totally sauced either.  Looked like the sauce was splashed on top of the pile leaving many completely dry.  I don't recommend getting these.  Save your money.  Three stars is for the pizza being good and the Manager being receptive of our feedback when I called them to let them know."}
{"text":"This Papa John's left me calling out \"Iyeee Papi!\" The crust was perfect; airy, fluffy and warm. Not too limpy where the toppings just slip off and make you pissed at the world, not too hard either unlike some pizzas where you feel like a wild animal on Plant Earth, capturing your prey after a long cold winter hibernation and tearing the limbs off that little bastard with your jaws, like how some Pizza crusts can be. *cough cough* Little Caesar's after one day. They also give out ample garlic spreads which, let's be honest, is the only reason people order from here. They had super fast prep time too. Thanks Papi Johns. Mama Miles love you long time."}
{"text":"This is the worst Papa Johns ever.  We have ordered twice and both times they messed up.  I would give zero stars if I could.    The last time we ordered we were using the free voucher from the previous order that was messed up.  We were given a delivery time of 1 hour.  2 hours later we were still waiting.  We were making a frozen pizza when it arrived....cold.    We were told that the next time we ordered it would be free....again!  We just tried to order again (I know, we are a gluten for punishment) but we thought it would be early enough that it would be alright.     But NOOOO; we were told we used our free voucher last time (for that cold 1 hour late pizza).  I tried to explain to James the manager; after a few minutes he said he didn't have time for this.  He said that the 1 hour delivery time was an \"estimate \"  AVOID AT ALL COSTS; THEY ARE AWFUL AND DONT TREAT THEIR CUSTOMERS RIGHT!!!!"}
{"text":"I ordered the special: two toppings on two large for twenty + charges. Was amazed at how efficient the \"new guy\" was; Don was his name. Delivery took 45 minutes in the rain, and a smiling representative gratefully accepted a change tip. The manager, Jennifer was a sweetheart, and though she was an obvious perfect fit for customer service, she comped my meal when I called to question the small amount of toppings. I am so impressed with the way they deal with orders from beginning to end.  I will ensure I ask for appropriate topping amounts next time, but there will definitely be a next time. Great food, great prices, just need a tweak on serving size measurements for toppings."}
{"text":"I love Papa John's but just not at this location.  Like the others have said, the \"crust\" is too fluffy and not crispy. I normally look forward to dipping the crust in the garlic sauce, but didn't bother this time. So very disappointed with this place."}
{"text":"Worst pizza place ever! Ordered my pizza about two hours ago,  called at the hour mark to ask where it was at,  they said it just got of the oven and would be delivered soon.  Called 30 minutes later, they said it was already in the car being delivered, another 20 minutes later, they said they tried to call to find us but no one answered (no one ever called)  oh yeah and the refund will take 3-5 business days. Worst customer service ever!"}
{"text":"I'm a huge Papa John's fan but this one is not the best. They're super fast and very nice but the pizza itself isn't as good as some other locations. Doesn't matter because I love it anyway!"}
{"text":"They met expectations.  Order was ready when they said, and tasty pizza.  My son's new favorite."}
{"text":"I loved this pizza! Was good... But, the promo code from my hotel wasn't allowed and I got no napkins! Really.. I'm in a hotel.. Anyways.. Pizza was great!"}
{"text":"I can't give them anything, but 1 star because I couldn't get the online promo code to work. The ad says \"Any Large $12\" and when I create my pizza it comes out with a $19.99 price before the delivery charge which brought the total to $25 something plus I needed to add the tip.  I tried it several times until I finally gave up.  I don't get it."}
{"text":"I ordered my pizza online at 6pm. It said my pizza should arrive 31 to 41 minutes. At 7 we still had no pizza. I called the store and she said a delivery person came to my house and no one answered the door. Thats impossible. We have 3 dogs that alert when anyone walks in the driveway. My husband was home and 3 kids and yet someone came to my door. The lady manager said she would give me preferred delivery to satisfy me. What is preferred delivery my food should be discounted if I waited 2 hours!!! Then she said 50 percent off. My original ordered was 31.00 she then gave me a total of 28.00 how is that 50 percent off!!! I will never order from papa johns ever again after poor leadership including the regional manager she said she called.I am a manager myself and this service was unacceptable!!!!! You have lost a lifelong customer!!!!!"}
{"text":"Are usually don't order my pizza from here but because Pizza Hut couldn't get it together It led me here. Let's just say I was not disappointed. Papa John's gave me exactly what I ordered. My biggest issue with Pizza Hut is that when I order extra sauce I get little to no sauce at all. But Papa John's came through! Thank you so much for this delicious tasting pizza !"}
{"text":"I would have to say the worst papa johns ever. They had messed up my order when they dropped off the pizza and i called stated it wasn't their fault. They did say they will return my money and just hung up on me. By the way never returned the money."}
{"text":"I always order my pizzas from here and it's always great. The staff is friendly and the thin crusts are absolutely delicious!"}
{"text":"First order, never arrives. Why would I order ever again?  No clue! But I tried again, only to receive semi baked, doughy pizza.  This place is a joke!"}
{"text":"This is the absolute worst location! I had placed a \"future\" order for four pizzas around noon, to be picked up at 5. When it got closer to 4 I realized I wouldn't be to the store in time so when I called them to hold off, they told me they ALREADY made my pizzas.......AT FOUR? An hour early? So I had to ask them to remake them since obviously they'd be cold, even if I was to arrive on time. It took awhile for them to decide they would, had to listen to a couple excuses first and was even told to \"place my order again online\" (even though I already paid). After receiving that order RAW, I was told I could get another pizza free of charge at a later date. When I arrived on time for that pizza, I waited about 20mins until I was told they were \"remaking my pizza due to some confusion\" (because apparently a plain cheese + pineapple pizza is confusing). Waited another 30mins and overheard a phone conversation of someone complaining, as well as a customer coming in to complain. WOULD NEVER RECOMMEND OR VISIT THIS LOCATION AGAIN!"}
{"text":"First it was disgusting to see a delivery driver come back from delivery and jump in on the production line without washing hands The pizza was also tasteless I ordered a vegetarian thin crust  I won't order here again based on the fact how unsanitary the making of pizza was"}
{"text":"We have ordered from here about 3 times since moving to this side of town. Pizza has been great and we keep getting coupons for free or discounted pizzas. We will continue to order from here."}
{"text":"I order from here every week.  Great service, very friendly and when an order has a mistake (wrong ingredient, wrong crust) they correct it on the spot and often give me the mistake pizza.   Used to go to another pizza place but this location and it's service makes me come back here."}
{"text":"I found a roach in my pizza box. 2 slices already eaten. I would never patronize Papa Johns again."}
{"text":"TERRIBLE SERVICE! We decided to order pizza for an executive meeting today and our pizza is now over and Hour and Half late!! We have been calling and calling to reach the store and no one answered, we then finally got a hold of someone and the customer service was extremely unprofessional, rude, and disrespectful! The guy said he was too busy this morning and then hung up! It has been completely embarrassing when you have executives that fly in for a meeting and order a quick lunch and the food is THIS late while members are hungry. I plan on calling the manager and would love an explanation."}
{"text":"Placed a future order about 4 hours in advance. Order showed up 1.5 hours late lol. called store and manager told us \"stuff happens, Sometimes they get busy\" i get if i ordered right now. but i ordered 4 hours ahead of time. then the pizza shows up cold. we call back, manager then tells us \" just not true that pizza was cold\" lol. and i use to order from them atleast 1x a week. havent ordered from them for last 3 months since this happened."}
{"text":"Every Tuesday they bring a pizza truck to Mahomet and sell large peperonni for five bucks. The problem is they don't put cheese on them."}
{"text":"Never have gotten a good deal with these guys. Which is sad, I like their thin crust pizzas with all the meats, but this one seems to be way overpriced, so when that happens I search elsewhere, forget they screwed me, end up over in their parking lot and see their sign. My stomach over rides my brain and says 'thin crust' and i place an order (giving them another chance) nope... Screwed again, shame on me as I put my wallet in my pocket and now review this place as I wait. First as a warning for you my friends, but mostly as a reminder for myself that I'm an idiot for trying them again"}
{"text":"some discounts are really worth... had the large veg topping pizza... awesome"}
{"text":"I don't know how they advertise that they use better ingredients.   My pizza was delivered cold and looked like it was microwaved.  It tasted terrible and a 14\" pizza with pepperoni and 6 garlic knots cost me over $30.  I will never eat there again"}
{"text":"I talked to Evan just a few minutes over the phone at Papa Johns after one of his people hung up on me. He handled my call with promptly and fixed the problem. If it was not for Evan at this location I would NEVER order pizza from Papa Johns. He is a good manager"}
{"text":"Tonight I had the double cheeseburger pizza & it was awful.  The pizza was so soggy that the toppings separated when I tried to pick up a piece.  It had a nasty white sauce on it and nothing about it tasted like a cheeseburger.  There was hardly any ground beef.  This pizza's a joke.  If I didn't get the half off deal I would have asked for my money back."}
{"text":"Ordered dinner to be delivered from here last night (19May2017), took over an hour and a half to arrive, which is fine. Even though it was less than 2 miles from their door to ours, it was a Friday night and I understand that a lot of people are ordering pizza, so no biggie.  The reasoning for the one star is as follows: driver shows up and is very apologetic. I tell him that it's cool, I get it and it's a Friday night. He informs me that there was some kind of delivery mix up (did not get into detail) and that I can call the store and they'll either comp this meal or give me a credit towards future meals. I'm all for that, and I love Papa Johns so after I eat, I call.  The management comes on the line after I speak to someone (and after what seems to be a brief period where they probably contacted the driver who told me to call in) and informs me that they do not give compensation due to delivery mix ups or late arrivals and only if there is an issue with the food. He did however offer to give me a pinky promise that next time it will be on time.  However, there won't be a next time. This is America in 2017, I have waaay more options and will not be reaching out to Papa Johns again due to this lack of customer care. Thanks for reading!"}
{"text":"Ordered pizza for store pick up only to arrive & find out it had been sent out for delivery to another. Would've taken 30 min. to make another one. Since we had to drive 30 min with limited time not worth the wait. IMO this was very stupid & we'll not be using them again."}
{"text":"Sorry Papa. My pizza was kinda bland, nothing really special about it. Instead of the Supreme maybe next time (if there is one) I'll try one of those specialty pizzas."}
{"text":"My husband and I ordered pizza from here on a Thursday night and were told that delivery was expected in about 30-40 minutes. At about an hour later, after still not receiving our pizza we called and were told that the driver was out and they couldn't get a hold of him--we remained on hold for almost twenty minutes while they tried to track down the delivery guy. We finally just demanded to speak to the manager who argued and told us that this was his best driver and he must just be at another customer's house. We in turn told him that we expected some sort of compensation for having to wait an hour and a half (so far) for our 1 pizza. He finally comped our order and about ten minutes after hanging up with him, the driver arrived. Our pizza was cold and the driver didn't even apologize for being so late. I WILL NEVER ORDER FROM HERE AGAIN."}
{"text":"So glad they've got a special going on! I've truly missed Papa John's Pizza since moving away from NLV. It's been a sold year since I've had my hands on one. The special they have going on is for an XL sized pizza with three toppings. I ordered carryout for a pepperoni, pineapple and extra cheese XL pizza for $12. Their pizzas come with a garlic sauce and a pepper. I love their garlic sauce! I also ordered a side of ranch for 0.99 cents. I placed an online order to pay with cash and my order was ready between the estimated time they gave me. The guy at the counter was real nice as I paid. He opened the box of pizza at the counter and showed me, to ensure that I received the correct order. I appreciated that, for sure. The pizza was piping hot as I was carrying it to my car. I love around the block from this location, so I was able to enjoy my pizza hot and fresh! The crust was nice and crunchy at the exterior, with a soft interior. There was a perfect amount of sauce, not too much and not too little. The toppings were a good amount, as well. The freshness of Papa John's is what has my family and returning over and over again. Definitely will be ordering from this location in the near future."}
{"text":"This place seems completely unable to get even the simplest orders correct, let alone deliver a hot pizza. Folks, there are way too many other pizza joints that have a much better product and will probably have a better chance of getting your order correct."}
{"text":"The lady who answered the phone was very rude and not helpful at all. Felt like I was a inconvenience and bothering her."}
{"text":"Love me some papa johns, Delivery service is relatively slow but pizza always delivers."}
{"text":"The food was on time but my order was weird? I had a bunch of pepperchinis piled in the corner of the box made the pizza and the box soggy. I like peppers but I didn't order them, and it was just odd. I ordered extra ranch and only got one but I had 4 garlic butter dipping sauce. My pizza was cold and it just wasn't good. I ended up not eating it. Bummer"}
{"text":"We ordered; they delivered when promised; it was hot and delicious. The delivery person was nice, clean, prompt. End of story."}
{"text":"We give our highest recommendations for Nick, Mgr. And the Great STAFF for their Professionalism and Great customer care services provided by the Talented staff of the  Papa John's Pizza family. In ESTRELLA Mountains Community. Highly recommended by Minister MOSES"}
{"text":"Ordered my pizza online and then showed up 20 min later to see if it was ready and was told that it would be another 5 min, so I paid and then sat down to wait. Then a rush of people came in and the phones started ringing off the hook. The 5 min I was told to wait became more like 15 min and my pizza was sitting on the rack and I still had to wait because the cashier at the front was tied up with multiple phone calls and customers at the register.   Apparently this location only has 1 person that's allowed to hand out carryout orders? Can nobody else step in and help when there is a packed room of customers? There were plenty of employees and all of them were either making food, on the phone or standing around while continuously teling the cashier that she had customers waiting.  When I finally got my pizzas everything was made correctly and tasted delicious, especially because we were starving! If you order from here when it's super busy it's definitely faster and less of a hassle to have it delivered."}
{"text":"Ordered pizza at at 11 am for 12:45pm delivery. Took till 2:20pm to deliver. It's a shame such good pizza is delivered by incompetence."}
{"text":"I get carryout from this location pretty often. Pizzas are made with care and typically ready within 10-15 minutes, even if they say it will take longer. As far as I can remember, service has always been friendly, save for this one rude employee a long time ago (whom I haven't seen in years and has probably left)."}
{"text":"Literally just left here and I usually drive to this location which is far from my place but only because I usually receive friendly service and a great pizza. Tonight I was waiting for my pizza and the employees took a little while to care that I was waiting at the register. I witnessed an employee drop the pizza dough on the floor, pick it up and continue making a pizza. Never again will I come to this location."}
{"text":"Shoutout to Robert for assuring quality!   My order took about 2 hours to arrive and when I called he said he'd void the order and give me the same pizzas I had ordered.   Sure the delivery time was long, but the customer service of assisting the customer was spot on."}
{"text":"This Papa John's deserves a zero rating. The manager Eli has no customer service skills and for the second time in a roll I didn't receive my pizza order.  Based on my call a moment ago and speaking to Eli, I'll be reporting to Corporate to  find new staffing or close as this place can't deliver and give Papa Johns a bad name"}
{"text":"A bunch of angry child delinquents work here and have the worst attitudes you can imagine. One worker actually rolled her eyes at me when I ordered an extra soda that wasnt on my original order! Workers that make the pizzas also handle cash at the register and nothing seems sanitary. I will be going to Pizza hut until things change"}
{"text":"Delivery was fast, everything was made correctly. I used the large 5 topping pizza for $12 promo and I find it a great bargain for high quality and the breadsticks I ordered tasted like authentic Italian bread I was very pleased with this order and the price was very reasonable will consider ordering again In the future   Well done Papa John's   -Kenneth"}
{"text":"Excellent especially with the 50% discount specials they always run. We always get a XL combo with a few substitutions which are never a problem here. The sauce is hands down 5X better than all the others to choose from. We order from here several times each month."}
{"text":"It's decent pizza. This is the location I order at when I don't want to go out for pizza and want it delivered. No matter when I order it's about 45min wait that's at 11 am 4pm or 8pm. It's not a bad location they haven't messed up on my order yet."}
{"text":"Only had one delivery driver and pizza took WAY OVER AN HOUR to be delivered. No notice. I had to call the restaurant and was barely offered an apology. Avoid this one, y'all."}
{"text":"Literally just hung up on some asshole who clearly can't operate a telephone. Even Hellen Keller had that position. RIDICULOUS"}
{"text":"Updated 7/8/15: got a great coupon so tried again. Still problems. I don't think they have good management. This time the pizza wasn't cut. Not a single piece. Online ordered and again they don't follow directions like extra sauce. Better delivery person though. Also don't count on delivery times. Order said it would be 40 minutes. Took an hour and 15. Funny thing... I pass by there when I grocery shop at Harris Teeter and Always see the employees out front smoking and even skateboarding. Where's the management?? Sticking with Pizza Hut and praying more aces move into our delivery area.  1st review: I haven't had PJs in a looooooong time but since this one just opened near my home I thought I'd try it. I ordered it online for delivery and asked for extra sauce and cheese (which I paid for). It definitely had neither. It was pineapple and bacon and some pieces didn't have any pineapple. I'll try to post a pic but hopefully you can see what looks like bacon is actually the sauce part (hence not extra cheese). The next negative? The driver was an absolute jerk. Rings the bell. Doesn't say hello back just hands me the slip to sign. I hand it back and he walks away and I gave a pretty decent tip. Note: don't put the tip on your CC ahead of time. Give it in cash on the spot. Had I done that he would've been walking away with a dollar.  The only redemption for 2 stars was the garlic knots. They were incredibly yummy."}
{"text":"Try the spinach Alfredo white sauce it's awesome!!! I can't have the red sauce due to stomach acid ,so try the white sauce"}
{"text":"Our first time ordering here and I will say the wings are some of the best chain pizza wings compared to most, and the cinnamon dessert is delicious, it doesn't have an overwhelming sweetness they had just enough that's only reason why I'm giving them three stars besides that I wouldn't give them more than three stars because of the pizza the pizza and it's self is alright if they added a little bit more sauce and a little bit more pepperoni it would be perfect and it's a great bargain for how much you get.   the delivery time is pretty fast."}
{"text":"This place is obviously under new management by the looks of the old reviews because their customer service is absolutely top notch!!! Twice now I have done pick up from them and both times I've had outstanding service. They told us 45 min to an hour and our pizzas were on time! We will be back!"}
{"text":"We ordered from here last night and as always it was fast and delicious. The delivery drivers are also always friendly. My only complaint is that last night the wings were a little puny."}
{"text":"This particular location has really let me down!!!  I ordered breadsticks and a large pizza. The breadsticks box had grease leaked all over. Both the pizza and the breadsticks are not the quality I used to.  The cheese on the pizza is not melted or maybe it had harden anyways I couldn't eat it after half of the slice. My partner and I are great fan of papa johns pizza but this particular location has the worst pizza/breadsticks and service."}
{"text":"Pizza as usual but absolutely great service. Thanks guys. You rock."}
{"text":"I would not eat here at all such bad service and not a care in the world I just called to place an order and talk about rude the manager picked up the phone like he hates his job I asked him if they were still running carry out and this  man said it's been closed since 10 the way he said sounded like he didn't even want to take business and then had the nerve to hang up on me now I see why such so bad reviews I will never ever ever eat at a Papa again this happens to often"}
{"text":"Ordered the double pepperoni with bacon & add spicy sausage please. Where's the bacon, where's the sausage. Very Dry. Little to no cheese or sauce !!   Not Good !! My first and last pizza from Papa John's & this location."}
{"text":"I tried to order over the phone with a coupon and they WILL ONLY accept coupons if you order online. Asked if I could do carry out they said they still won't accept it. Thanks for making go out of my way!"}
{"text":"For take out pizza it was not bad!! Have so many to choose from have Never tried papa johns before! So took a chance,it was hot and came with extras! Will I order again maybe but am going to try others since I'm new to this area!"}
{"text":"True story: they put me on hold on the phone, so I left my house, went to the store, ordered pizza and I was still on hold on the phone. At the store, the slowest person ever was taking the calls. Everything is slow! They are very slow and when I complained to the manager, he said they are busy. What a joke! Not even 5 orders in there.  The manager was literally the only one working in there: opening pizza, putting toppings, checking the oven... the rest of the staff was useless, like they have never been trained. The one star goes for the manager's effort, nothing else"}
{"text":"Fast service, efficient and nice employees. I typically order online and pick up at the store since I live close-by and my order is always ready by the time I get there. Pricing is reasonable and they typically have mid-week specials to get you to order Mon-Thurs"}
{"text":"We ordered there the other day and we had gotten the two med pizza deal they have and while I was waiting for the delivery the girl Amy texted me saying she would be there in \"9 minutes\" and my door bell did not ring until 20 minutes later!!! I sat down to eat my pizza and it was gross! It was cold and hard to chew! I called the store and spoke with the manager who sounded like he did not want to help me at all he said \"what do you want me to do \" then went on and said that he can credit my account for another day or send new pizzas. Well I wanted the new pizzas. Those got to me fairly quickly but I opened the box to find the new fresh pizzas significantly SMALLER than they should have been and smaller than my first pizzas!!! I'm so disappointed with this location we order from them all the time and it's like they don't even care about their customers or their food quality!"}
{"text":"This papa johns pizza location is absolutely horrible! They double charged my credit card and I have been told the manager would call me by three different people! Nobody has ever contacted me and I really can't afford to pay twice for dinner. It very unfortunate because this was my favorite place to eat before I recently moved closer to this location.They have very poor customer service and the pizza at this location is not worth the price."}
{"text":"Order online through the App. I Always forget the condiments (which used to be free, but I digress). I pay with debit card. I call store to add condiments. Here are my options: charge my card twice and chase a refund 2 days later. Change to cash and pay the entire order with cash upon delivery (basically double charging again, since I already paid on my card) or go without. Because adding condiments is too hard for this group. Cameron who claimed to be the manager there couldn't tell me what was going to happen with my card. And refunding me. Or when. So I just said forget it. We will go without condiments. And never order a papa johns pizza again. It's that simple. Tons of pizza delivery in Vegas. Why choose you? Overcharge. Double charge. And make something as simple as ordering a pizza a problem I have to fix now. What a joke."}
{"text":"Un fortunately this is the best pizza in the area.  Just had it tonight because the dbacks won yesterday so it's 50% off here.  Chicken poppers were good tonight.  Not great food but not terrible food either.  Good for half off"}
{"text":"If you want your Grub on time, Don't order through this store on the Hub.  Needed some Pizza and Chicken delivered to an office meeting I sponsored. I ordered this online through GHub and made the order for a later time.  I gave them over 2 hours to make sure the pizza was delivered no later than 12 Noon.  Many calls went back and forth with the store because the time for lunch was scheduled and could not change it due to a class being taken by my clients.  I was offered a refund if I did not take delivery but that was at 12:40pm and did not leave me enough time to go find food elsewhere.   Bottom line, the pizza and chicken arrived cold and the sauces I chose were not included.  It made me look bad since my clients had to eat during class and it was ice cold.  By the way, the pizza arrived at 1:01PM.  Wow!!!"}
{"text":"Always super fast delivery and everything you can expect from a big chain pizza joint!"}
{"text":"So, you come in, mid-day and there is no one there to help you out. When someone finally does come, no hello or anything! The lady working here today was a grouch!  A small veggie took 10 min to cook so that part was great and thankfully we had somewhere else to go for 10 min!  The pizza was super healthy tasting and filling with multi-grain crust - dry though, I knew I should have asked for more tomato sauce. 2 pieces and you will be full! Zero stars for service at this location as there was not even an attempt from the lady at the counter to aim for customer service in any way! Freaking expensive too - a small is $14. Take out only."}
{"text":"Everyone knows Papa John's, so I won't review the food. I will caution diners about this restaurant though.   I had PJ's about a week ago and got sick. I assumed it was because I ate too much, but I'm thinking it may have been caused by something else.  I went in around 7:00 pm and my pizza was ready. The cashier asked for my name, went around the corner, and without saying anything to me answered the phone, punched in something into the computer, and start folding boxes. She then proceeded to go make a pizza without putting on any gloves or washing her hands. How that is even allowable is beyond me. There were three girls working, and they all looks pretty young and unmanaged. I'm really surprised the Health District hasn't shut them down. Absolutely disgusting!   As I said, I HIGHLY caution all diners before ordering from this joint. It's not that good anyway!"}
{"text":"Ordered the \"special\" today and was told it would be a thirty to forty minute delivery time. The guy who took my order was very polite and accommodated my delivery request but did not confirm my address or phone number and both were wrong. I called once to check in and gave the correct address. One hour and a half after I placed my order I called again and the cashier put my on hold for 5 minutes. When the manager got on the phone all he said to me was \"what's the issue\"? I heard you gave the wrong address and we have the wrong phone number so I sent the driver back here. He is on his way again. When I asked if the food would still be hot and he said it should be fine. That is terrible service. The pizza finally came and no it wasn't even warm. It's pretty sad."}
{"text":"Ordered, had a problem. We are delivered pizzas 20 minutes late, over an hour in. Our Hawaiian was a plain cheese. Call the store. The manager wouldn't talk to us. Tells the kid on the phone we can wait another 45 minutes for the correct pizza or can have a gift card. Really? Maybe try something to appease the customer and apologize? Major miss. Sent the lot back and won't order again. Funny thing is I only like the garlic butter. The pizza is mediocre at best!"}
{"text":"FANTASTIC! Pizza was amazing today and our delivery driver, Andre, which I had some issues with last time was super friendly and prompt! I really was satisfied with today's experience and will order again! Thank you!"}
{"text":"Pro's: Good pizza for a large pizza shop chain,Interesting yummy specialty pizzas.Their online order system is easy to use on a pc. Delivery has always been around 30 minutes, sometimes sooner. Courteous drivers and employees on the phone.  Meh: Small-ish and unoriginal selection of pizza toppings. Their bone-in wings look & taste like pre-cooked baked ones which I'm not a fan of. The mobile version of their online ordering is a pain to navigate. Some coupon codes from their ads in the mail  don't work - but they will honor them if you call."}
{"text":"The 2 stars are purely because the food was great. Aside from that, the service was horrible. I walked in, and for a good 10 minutes, 3 workers quietly argued over who would talk to me. Finally, one of them looked at me and said that someone would help me momentarily. Apparently, not everybody at this location is trained in talking to a customer. One young gentleman walked up 5 minutes later and finally took my order. I was only there to pick up! The order was ready already! This shouldn't have been a nearly 20 minute wait."}
{"text":"I usually order online from the papa johns website. I only came to this yelp page to quickly find the number of the shop so that I could outright cancel my order after the delivery guy brought me the wrong order. That's the only issue I've had with this location and not alone enough to warrant a one -star review. However, it was very unsettling to read about the sanitary issues, knowing I've eaten from here before. I will no longer order from this location."}
{"text":"Apparently this is an outlier review, but we had an awesome experience tonight. The girl that took our order was really sweet, personable and helpful, and the driver was exceptionally courteous and accommodating, delivering to a resort area that they typically won't do because of a pizza place on the grounds (which had closed down and no longer operational, so hopefully this location will have less of a hassle delivering here in the future). We were quoted about 45 minutes for delivery and the pizza arrived around 30 instead, and was still hot and in good shape."}
{"text":"I've been a regular at this Papa John's for more than 8 years, they have different managers every year or so, but they get to know you by name when you order every week.   I love the pizza obviously, especially the crust. It's damn good pizza for the price. I've had pizza from a lot of places and I continue to return to Papa John's, I like it.  The pizza's at usually ready in 15 minutes if you pick up the order (I don't get delivery cause it's so close by). They like to have carry out orders in by 9:38 PM."}
{"text":"The pizza came 15 minutes later than it was supposed to and then it was burned. We were hungry and didn't want to wait for them to pick it up and make another one so we ate the burned one. Very disappointed......."}
{"text":"The pizza was not the best I've had from Papa Johns and they made the price seem like such a great deal but in reality its the same price at dominoes or pizza Hut.  They claimed that the $12 pizza was a student 50% off deal....ummmm, then that would make the regular price of a large  cheese pizza $24. Makes no sense,  but my niece feel for it anyway."}
{"text":"I wish I could leave no stars considering I got no food...   But Im probably better off bc this place just looks like it has roaches. The outside is dirty, walked in they had a full trash can in the waiting area... and not a small office trash can, one of those large \"dump the lawn mower out\" outside trash cans.   I go to pay for my food & they hadn't even started my food despite the fact that I called 15mins before. Im on my lunch...   I canceled the order & went across the street to Chuckie Cheese got my pizza for $5 less & in a timely fashion (although they probably have roaches too lol)"}
{"text":"I'm a LONG-time Papa John's customer. But, regardless the quality of their pizza and delivery, of their online delivery fee ($3.10), none  of it goes to the delivery drivers.  NONE!  I'm appalled that not one-cent is shared with drivers; it's just an add-on to the actual price of the pie.  What greed!  Especially in this day and age, when so many (other than corporate officers) are needy.  I'm looking for another pizza place ASAP until this policy changes and I encourage you to do the same.  Don't forget to tip; look out for your delivery drivers because Papa John's certainly isn't."}
{"text":"I order my pizza online because of the T-mobile deal. When I walked in the cashier was with another customer and I waited in line behind another lady. When he got done with her and cashed her out she was going to order more food but told the cashier to help the next lady who walked in after me. The cashier wore his hat incorrectly and the way he wore it he could barely see and looked very unprofessional. Had he wore it correctly and looked like he cared to be at work he may have be able to see who walked in and helped the next person. But instead he doesn't really look up and appeared to be disarrayed working at the cashier.  I had to pretty much stand right up front to get noticed without being rude. It took all of me not to get rude and say something to him and the woman who was also knew I was waiting in line behind her. Just because you have rude customers in your store it's your job to ensure you don't make the matter worse by other ignorant behaviors. The service to order online was fast but to get the pizza a whole different story. The store was not packed at all."}
{"text":"Very slow even for them. Hour an a half is a long time on a wednesday night... Delivery guy acted all stressed and in a hurry and he still brought me a cold pizza. Stjll tastes better then dominos and pizza hut but I still expect better from papa johns. Definetly gonna pick up my pizza for now on"}
{"text":"I really like Papa John's.  I recently found them because of their service to Bike MS.  That charity work and good food was amazing. Thank you for fighting multiple sclerosis."}
{"text":"I'm going to keep it real short and simple they just delivered me a burnt pizza.  I ordered a pizza I waited about 30 minutes real good timing real nice fella when I open my pizza it was burnt scary because they saw that the pizza was burnt but they still brought it here wow. Yes we ate it because we were starving but I didn't think this should go unchecked and unreported"}
{"text":"I have never had a problem, but after tonight I will never order or get papa johns again. I ordered pizza online. I have a logon ID which I used. Everything went great. I waited for over a hour and ten minutes for the pizza. I called and asked them about the pizza. They said I never ordered it. I told them that it submitted. I called their customer service line. They called when I was on hold. I picked up, and they said we are sorry the order you placed was for carry out only. I never received anything so I had no idea. I would have come and picked it up yet no one called me. The people on the phone were nice. I do not eat anything past nine as a general dieted rule. I called their customer service, and the woman wasn't even empathetic. She said I would get a call back in the next day. I cannot wait to tell their upper management what i think."}
{"text":"Buffalo chicken pizza is back!  Always get fast friendly delivery from this place. Not a huge fan of their regular pizza, but they really have something with this buffalo chicken pizza."}
{"text":"I always order from this location, great pizza and delivery is on time. For my last order, I ordered online for delivery and paid with my card like I always do. When the delivery guy showed up, he wanted cash and I didn't have any. I told him I paid with my card, and he said sometimes that happens and had to call the store and read my card number over the phone. I wasn't too comfortable with that. The pizza box said \"MasterCard\" so I wasn't sure what the problem was. I'm really hoping that was a one time thing."}
{"text":"I guess I'm not picky with my pizza because I really enjoyed Papa John's. I usually pick it up from their location and it's ready in about 10-15 minutes and although the doughy crust isn't for everyone and their \"garlic sauce\" is just an excuse for not saying \"Melted butter\", I also discovered their thin crust pizza is really great. Other pizzerias haven't really impressed me in the area. So I'll continue to go and keep finding a better place that can convince me not to. Hasn't been the case yet."}
{"text":"They have really good pizza, its fast and ive ordered from here more then a dozen time and i've never had a problem."}
{"text":"It's hard to write this review due to the fact that the pizzas were pretty good until one of my employees found a hair baked into the thin crust pizza. I tried to pull it out but the whole slice came with it. So I tossed the rest away which was unfortunate because it was tasty. Yes I could call and complain and probably get reimbursed but this is just as good. Myself being in the medical field and a health food inspector in the past, this is more of a \"Make aware and fix\" review. Will I stop ordering from Papa John's, probably not."}
{"text":"While I don't generally order out for pizza, when I do, I'm usually very satisfied with Papa John's.  Their online ordering is great, and always winds up with a correct order.  They deliver within 30-40 minutes, and since they are close to my house, the pizza is always hot."}
{"text":"Bottom line, I never received my pizza I ordered.   So I ordered a pizza at 11:00PM cause I was working late that night. The online tracker told me it would come on 20-30 minutes, I watched the online tracker as it reached 11:30 then midnight. All the time it said it was \"On the way\" But then it showed that the pizza had been delivered. NO IT HAD NOT. I called the Pizzeria and they said it had just went out, not to worry about the tracker, and should be there in 10 minutes. Nothing, not even a call from the delivery man. I tried calling the pizzeria again but no answer, I think everyone went home. So by 1:30 my building was closing so I went home.   I called them the next day and the guy on the line was apologetic, hopefully my refund will come in soon. I will not recommend ordering pizza from this location unless they get more organized."}
{"text":"You get yelled at if they take your order wrong. There is a shift leader with a bad attitude."}
{"text":"Pizza was delivered in 30 minutes. However when I called to place the order specifically asked about garlic sauce and when we got the pizza there was none in there. Very disappointed"}
{"text":"Looking at these reviews they must had updated they're service. These guys are good here at this location for papa johns delivery service always on time or ahead of time. Kudos to these guys,, let me tell u their pizza's always taste good are fresh cooked and made to perfection. Delivery always on time.  Good job here at this location!"}
{"text":"Over cooked, dry, hard breadsticks.  So disappointed that they felt it was okay to distribute this to a customer.  This was my first time purchasing at the new location on Waddell and it will be my last.  I will continue to go to the Bell or Litchfield locations even though they are further away.  Management this is unacceptable and embarrassing.  My pizza was over cooked as well but edible."}
{"text":"I went there a couple times to pick up the pizza I ordered online, the employee was friendly and the pizza was ready, it is a small store so there weren't any lines. They added extra gralic sauce and Jalapeno on the side, overall it is a nice store"}
{"text":"Just ordered 2 pizza's....one was vegetarian because I don't eat pork or beef (black olives, pepperocini and mushrooms was ordered). They delivered the wrong pizza...the label on the box was correct, but the pizza inside was wrong it had tomato, onion, pepperocini and some type of salami. I called the store immediately after the delivery guy left and when the guy who answered the phone heard me tell him I got the wrong pizza he kept saying \"Oh interesting, interesting\" in a condescending tone as if he didn't believe me. He offered to give me a credit on my next order. I told him I just wanted a refund for this 1 pizza (not my entire order) and he said no they can't do that. I told him he was welcome to have his delivery guy come pick it up since I don't eat meat, but now I'm left paying for something I didn't order. I told him I would have to dispute it with my credit card company then and he said \"Ha, ha, good luck with that.\". Nice customer service there guy... Papa John's Pizza 83rd Ave and Union Hills  I would normally just say whatever no big deal, it's about $7 who cares...but because of how the guy on the phone spoke to me...here it is."}
{"text":"Needed a pizza at the last minute on a Friday night for a bunch of picky kids.delivery was on time and pizza was hot and delicious.no complaints!"}
{"text":"I'm a big fan of Papa Johns and I usually order from a store by my house. Tonight I went over to a friends and ordered online from this location cuz it was right by here and they couldn't even deliver it to the right apartment. And when calling in they said it was our fault. They said we were making a prank call trying to get a free pizza. I'm a grown ass man, I don't need to play pranks to get food to feed me and my friends. They said they could promise another pizza in an hour but seriously?? Worst customer service. Never order from this location."}
{"text":"Rude and expensive....I had a deal/coupon from their website I wanted to use and the CSR/Manager? told me I could only use it through the app. She was rude, not friendly and acted like I was bugging her by trying to order. I don't pay 15-16$ for a large pizza unless I'm at a nice restaurant especially when I can get 1 for 7.99$ (Dominos)"}
{"text":"Ok so let me just start here I have had issues with Papa John's before I have not ordered pizza from them in 2 years but tonight I was watching a commercial and I thought that pizza sure does look good so I'll give them another try. SORRY DOMINOS I should have been faithful. I placed my order and received my confirmation email your pizza will be there in 40-50 minutes. I waited an hour and 15 minutes and thought I'll call and check on it. The first guy I talked to put me on hold for 5 minutes and 43 seconds before the manager got on the phone and said to me the driver rang your doorbell and no one answered so he left. No sir there are 3 people here 2 of us are in the living room 10 feet from the door and windows wide open he didn't come here. Oh yes ma'am he did he's been a driver with us for over 20 years he wouldn't lie. Um NO he wasn't here. Then the manager continued to yell at me and when I got mad back he accused me of being rude. THEN he says oh wait never mind that wasn't you your order was placed online and YOU picked for the order to be picked up. Wait you just accused me for 10 minutes of not answering my door when the guy delivered my pizza then you all of a sudden decide to change to I ordered it wrong??  He did send out my order for free my pizza is really under cooked when picked up it falls apart. Yeah I will not make this mistake again until you get 7032 Brighton Park Drive, Mint Hill, NC 28227 store in order I won't be back. And if you need more proof yelp all 1 star complaints and google as well."}
{"text":"I'm not proud of the fact that in the last three weeks, I've ordered delivery from Papa Johns three times. With that being said, it was really good pizza. I don't care for chain restaurant styled pizza, but the three I ordered from them for myself and my boyfriend were good.   First week - Large pizza with mushroom, chicken on my half, peppers and tomatoes on his half.   Second week - Extra large grilled chicken and mushroom pizza.  Third week - Extra large mushroom and parmesaen cheese pizza. This one was my favorite.  Each time, the order came in about 30 minutes or just under. We ordered online (because we're suckers for 21st century lazines) and were able to include the tip that way (didn't have any cash each time)."}
{"text":":( I just want to apologize to my GF real quick on the two stars because she loves this place and I just can't do it.  Up until a couple of weeks ago I hadn't had Papa Johns in about 10 years. I've never been a fan and always preferred Pizza Hut. The quality of ingredients is better. Anyway, she suckered me into giving it a chance and I can't say I'm impressed. There were so many ingredients but I still felt like it was bland in a way...nothing too special about it. They're also a bit overpriced in my opinion."}
{"text":"Normally  really good. I have a difficult address but I leave the porch light on and they always make it. This last time though... I waited and waited. Far longer than I should have. Called to inquire where my order was they look it up by address. The phone number was wrongs... oops. Instead of \"ma'am don't have the rigjt number. We are sending the pizza now we have the number.\"  It was my fault I didn't  update, my profile, my fault they did not find my address this time, and my fault I was not eating my pizza instead of calling them  to  see where my order was. I wasn't looking for a hand out so I don't think she needed to be combative over the phone. However they took care of the order. Thanks papa. My boyfriend (as cute and clever as he is) paid the delivery driver then asked for the receipt. The receipt showed that the order was taken of for being late.... so after just paying full price. We flagged him to show him. He said he didn't know. Honest mistake. Got our money back left him a tip for his trouble. And THEN got to enjoy our pizza. Our whole one piece non sliced pizza. Needless to say I'll  probably order thru my cell phone app again. Yelp just me a positive outlet to voice my frustrations and opinions. Thank you."}
{"text":"Fast and friendly service here. They are always quick, and they are happy to tell you of ways to save $$ when ordering (I have 5 kids so this is important). I love their BBQ chicken pizza!"}
{"text":"I received 50% off of my pizza here tonight and it was absolutely gross! I hate to say this but even Little Ceasars or the dreaded Dominoes could do better. The pizza reminded me of one of those .99 cent tv dinner pizzas that had gone bad. I don't know what happened to Papa John lately but he has gone wayyyyyyyyyy downhill... almost underground since I was a kid."}
{"text":"The pizza itself is really good but it is also nice that they have other stuff then just pizza"}
{"text":"I always get consistently good pizza and service from this location.  I order once a month or so and really enjoy this convenient treat.    I reccomend a pizza with pepperoni, yellow peppers, and pineapple.  Delicious."}
{"text":"Third time in a row this place won't do what it takes to honor their own coupons. The combination of substandard pizza coupled with shady sales tactics isn't a good business model. ZERO stars is more appropriate.."}
{"text":"First time at this location, I am not happy with the burnt pizza. We are watching the Mayweather fight and eating over cooked pizza."}
{"text":"Terrible service! I ordered 3 pizzas, and the Works one didn't have any meat on it. This was going to be for friends who are helping us move, so I called & talked to the manager. He was curt, rude (\"Well did you eat it already!?\"), and told me that I had to drive back in with the pizza to get a replacement. No refund, no effort to make up for the mistake. They should have at least delivered another for free. Not ordering from here again."}
{"text":"I am very disappointed in Papa Johns. Tonight I ordered a pizza, garlic knots and wings from this location at 753 pm and I did not receive it until 9 pm. I called twice in the meantime only to be told that \"maybe I should tell the delivery guy to be faster next time\"  I've been to this Papa Johns before and it has never been like this. I am very disappointed in their customer service. I chose this location as it is 5 minutes away from my house. It's estimated delivery time was at 830. I'm most likely never going back due to this incident."}
{"text":"If you enjoy raw dough and management that ignores complaints, eat here often. So I dont like RAW DOUGH, but I \"did\" love Papa Johns original crust, this place just refuses to flatten the dough in the center of the pizza, like EVER. I have ordered at least 20 pizzas with raw hunks of dough in the center here. I started ordering the pizzas \"well done,\" but that does not fix the problem because the problem is taking the 30 seconds to flatten the dough in the middle so there are no large hunks of dough.   So I called management and asked them to fix the problem. I swear to god they must mess with people for fun here. The more you call and complain the more hunks of raw dough will be in your pizza. So I wrote corperate and nothing.... no response...wrote a second time, no response... f$!$ Papa Johns, I will never eat here again.   I never realized how good pizza hut crust was, why did I ever eat this crap to begin with?"}
{"text":"SUPERBOWL....If you want cold pizza and rubbery wings!"}
{"text":"Dog food. No idea what has happened to Papa johns pizza but it now is this terrible pan pizza that has no taste. Last time I roll with papa johns"}
{"text":"I am of Wiiiam W.'s review this place needs a big fat 0 !  Long delivery time, cold pizza, and way to doughy yck..."}
{"text":"Ordered from papa johns when staying in Phoenix. The cheese pizza was to be well done and we were supposed to have cheese cups with order. No cheese cups and the pizza was burnt. Took over 1 hour to get the new non-burnt pizza and the cheese cups. At this point, the breadsticks which the cheese cups were for were extremely cold. Very disappointing.   The driver clearly took more orders before getting our fixed pizza out.  Not acceptable."}
{"text":"Tried the chocolate chip pizza.  It was so much smaller than I thought it would be and the taste was just okay.  Won't be ordering that again!"}
{"text":"Been having ongoing issues with this turd of a place and it's terrible customer service. Check out how they think is an acceptable delivery.  https://www.yelp.com/user_photos?select=Vw3mpO3rV0LkIeyUFXFu1A&userid=5KuMgI-6Cf6LamBkW9RIpw"}
{"text":"So I started off ordering my pizza online and about 35 min after called for a time estimate and it was then realized some how the online computer system generated an address that was diff from what I had entered. ( I guess this is somewhat of a reoccurring issue)  I was pretty annoyed because by this time I had already waited awhile... I talked to a guy that was the manager of the incorrect location and he immediately apologized as told me he would be comping free pizzas for me at the location I needed originally. He wAs very nice and apologetic and sent my order to the correct location... The young lady with bright colored hair that delivered my pizza gave such great customer service along with everyone else I delt with... They took a crappy situation and completely turned it around.. The pizza was super yummy as well... Great job! I will deff be a returning customer"}
{"text":"My daughter ordered a pizza the other day while we were out and it was disgusting. She ate a few bites and that was it. The cheese was either bad or fake. The garlic knots were burnt. My husband tried to eat a slice and he threw it away as well thinking she was just being picky. I went to your website and by the time I found your guarantee it was past the 30 minutes. I think that is a great way to attempt to offer customer service but not really. Very disappointed in your product and will not ever order again from you. I will be giving papa johns 1 star and let people know that this store does not use the freshest ingredients and that your \"guarantee\" is a poor attempt at customer service. I'm sure Papa and Payton wouldn't appreciate their names endorsing what my daughter was served."}
{"text":"I had an online order so not much communication as to what I needed/wanted. They didn't mess up the pizza, however; the ONE lady that was prepping pizza and apparently doing everything else was in obvious need of assistance but the gentleman (delivery driver) was no help to her at all. Kind of felt bad for her. Pizza was kind of sloppy & not the best customer service."}
{"text":"2 hr wait for delivery?? Tues at 6? Pizza was cold manager would not get on the phone when I called to voice my concern, instead a girl told me that she was too busy to speak to me,she being the manager... what a joke..."}
{"text":"Carried out a one 2 topping pizza and they forgot one topping! We also had chicken poppers. Total $28.99 when we called to inquire they wanted us to come get a replacement. They wouldn't deliver a new pizza and said they'll give us a new one next time. Sorry, no next time when there are LOTS of other places to go. Dewey's Pizza on Lee, Teresa's on Taylor, Geracies on Warrensville, 2Guys at Coventry,  Pizza Hut, Dominos,  ANYWHERE  but this OVERPRICE SLOPHOLE."}
{"text":"The dumb broad who delivered the pizza to my mom refused to give her the receipt. Come to find out, she gave herself a tip! My mom is on a fixed income! If the idiot didn't give her an attitude she probably would have gotten a legit tip. But no, instead papa jhons hires fraudulent staff. Now I have to drive my mom there to get her debit card credited back. I'm making sure this place gets reported!   DO NOT ORDER HERE!   Come hell or high waters, I will make sure that low life is without a job."}
{"text":"I wish Papa John's had the $10 any large pizza deal all of the time! They were running this special up until the SuperBowl.  After an entire day on a flight, this was a perfect stop to pick up comfort food on the way home. I made a call and within 10-15 minutes, my pizza was ready for me. I've had it delivered before and the service is good, but since this was on the way, I tried the drive-thru for the first time.   Pizza was fresh, hot, and had a good amount of toppings. For a quick and affordable pizza, this hit the spot!"}
{"text":"Just got off of the phone with store manager \"Sandit\" ...he says he's \"been cutting pizzas all morning\" and he \"hasn't seen a burnt one\" ..maybe I'm just delusional from hunger what do you guys think..?"}
{"text":"the pizza was over an hour late it took over 2 hours from order to delivery. the pizza tasted horrible. I understand its delivery and not expected to be as good as roccos or grimaldis, but it was nasty doughy and tastless and the delivery guy wined to me about his entire life story as he appoligized for the latness I could not get rid of this numnut so I just said seeya and slamed the door after finally getting this nasty excuse for pizza"}
{"text":"Worst pizza ever. UF.......this place has changed owners or management. Pizza tasted old and was not fully cooked."}
{"text":"I love Papa John's pizza but this location has serious service issues. Last Sunday I tried to order online but it would not process so I had to call. The phone attendant was incredibly slow and his repeats back to me were mostly incorrect. An hour after I ordered the pizzas they still had not arrived so I called to check on them and was told the order was deleted by mistake. No apologies or anything. I was told the manager would compensate us but when I drove in to pick up the original order to be delivered no one made any mention of their mistake. Tonight I went to order online and the order went through but I never received a confirmation email. About 20 minutes after I placed the order I called to follow up since I did not receive a confirmation and was placed on hold. After 5 minutes I hung up and called back and when Annie - who left me on hold previously - asked if I would hold I said no and she said 'thank' and out me on hold anyway. I hung up and called back and the manager answered and I explained all the issues and all he did was check the order and say it would be here shortly. So of course I related all of the above and he asked what they could do instead of offering apologies or solutions."}
{"text":"No customer service skills for the staff! The one short gal was trying to be nice but the other guy was rude!"}
{"text":"We've tried this store several times in the last 10 years, and they've made a great improvement in the last year or so. Their ingredients have improved, and their red sauce is now tangy like it should be, and no longer has a BBQ taste to it. I would have given them 5 stars, but we have had a few errors in a couple of orders recently. They have always made up for them though, so we continue to use them for our delivery pizza. Keep up the good work guys! Give them a try again if you haven't had them in a while."}
{"text":"Well the last two times we wanted a pizza delivered we went to Papa John's, and they have both times been very fast to deliver what I would call a good pizza. The toppings are good quality, and the hand tossed crust is good. I wish the sauce had a little more tang, and a little less sweet, but it's decent. My wife love the thin crust, and she has been happy with both pizzas. The Chicken Cordon Bleu she had today was excellent.   We even tried out the double chocolate brownies tonight, and they we hot and fresh, with plenty of chocolate."}
{"text":"We have patronized this particular Papa Johns restaurant several time over a year and about 70-75% of the time there has been no problems, but when there has been issues it has been horrid! For the most part the pizza has been on par, but on one occasion they forgot to include an item on the order and when I called to complain I was blamed for it and had to go back and raise a fuss to get a proper resolution. I was upset that the employee did not seem to care about their mixup and my inconvenience.  On the most recent occasion the other day, we ordered online for delivery and when the pizza arrived my wife noticed hair on the pizza! I immediately called and the staff member that answered the phone pretended they couldn't hear me and when I raised my voice the employee became upset and hung up. I was hung up a total of 3 times while trying to get a resolution! I went up to the restaurant and surprise surprise they seemed to have no problem hearing me in person! I only asked for a replacement pizza, but refused! They instead gave me a refund.   The staff in general seem rude, lax and uncaring when it comes to customer service. Good customer service is key to me recommending an establishment and because of the negative runIns with staff I can not recommend the University Heights Papa Johns."}
{"text":"Great service! We love that they support our school! They recently did a fundraiser and donated twenty percent back to our school! Love their pizza and the people who work there!"}
{"text":"Pineapple pizza was goood! delivery driver was a doll and remembered crushed red peppers plus parmesan! Guess ya gotta ask them for it if ya want extras nowadays. They used to just deliver seasonings and parm with the pizza lol"}
{"text":"I ordered my pizza online, showed up at the store when the email said that out would be ready, and nobody was there.  Lights off, doors locked. I called the store later and explained the situation and the employee called me a liar. Stay away from these scumbags"}
{"text":"I love papa johns, just not this one.  Whenever I order pizza from here, it usually tastes great, but the last 3-4 times has me looking elsewhere for pizza. Like I said though, the pizza tastes great, it's just afterwards I feel like I have food poisoning from eating the pizza. I get sick, nauseous, and other tmi stuff that's gross to mention on a food post.   I don't know, maybe it's from something else, but after 4 times in a row feeling like that after consuming the pizza, I feel like it's probably the pizza. Ehh, I will probably go to other papa johns and see how it is, just not here."}
{"text":"Pizza was cold, which of course you can warm up but the pizza was completely burnt. So disappointed in the quality of the pizza   Posted this review and no out reach from management someone contact me"}
{"text":"Avid Papa Johns pizza eater for my family. Finally started to utilize the app and the rewards program. Earned a free pizza 3 weeks ago. Went to retrieve my free pizza and my points were GONE! WTF! the guy at the store said there's nothing he can do, so I'm basically screwed. The incentives were nice seeing as their pizza isn't the cheapest around. Made me lose any interest in returning."}
{"text":"Online ordering is the way to go with Papa John's. With only being a couple blocks from home I can avoid the delivery charge by just picking it up in store.   Hand tossed pizzas are my staple and Papa John's offers one of the best. Usually end up pairing with an affordable side of cheese bread. The food is worth the price, even if the in store service is slow."}
{"text":"Good pizza & friendly staff. Online order and picked up in person. Fast and easy. What more can you ask for from a pizza place?"}
{"text":"The pizza at Papa Johns is great, however the service and reliability of this location is not. Their online ordering system confirms that you will get your pizza before their real location even opens and knows how many orders that they have for the lunch rush. If you call because your pizza is over 45 minutes late, you get attitude--maybe because others have been calling with the same problem. Use another location.  EDIT: The manager, Matthew, did a great job at rectifying the situation."}
{"text":"Awful place. Kids just working here for a paycheck, they don't care one bit about customer statisfaction. Asked the ignorant kid in charge if he could split the order down the middle as me and my buddy got the two pizza deal and he said he \"never heard of anyone doing that\".  Pathetic pizza, absolute garbage. Stay away from this place. I'm calling their corporate number after I finish this review. IT IS THAT BAD."}
{"text":"We ordered this pizza because papa johns sent us a postcard about how there last delivery was not made quickly. This pizza took 1 hour and 15 minutes for an order placed at 8:00pm on a Tuesday. They said it would be 25 minutes. The order said delivered online 25 minutes before we got it. We had to call to see if it was still coming. The pizza arrived stuck to the box and room temperature, at best."}
{"text":"Really good pizza at a good price. The 5-topping $12 pan deal is excellent in my opinion. Sauce is a little too much on then sweet side, for my taste at least. But overall very good pie."}
{"text":"After getting one wrong pizza and one correct one I had to call and request that they send me the right pizza.  While we were waiting we started to eat the other pizza and immediately had to spit it out because it had a horrible chemical taste. I immediately called them back and let them know that I just wanted my money back. I will never order papa johns pizza again. It wasn't good and it is never worth the money."}
{"text":"I ordered a medium pizza with one topping (sausage) and the delivery guy gave us cheese instead. A common mistake which was fine I guess, but what was even more annoying was he had to make a racist comment to my friend.  He kept asking my friend how to say thank you in his language, because he was Asian. My friend responded by, \"Same as how you say it. 'Thank you'.\" and the delivery guy kept asking, \"No but really how do you say thank you from where you guys are from?\" My friend kept ignoring him and politely insisted he was born in America and he spoke English. The delivery guy still wouldn't leave him alone until he spoke mandarin.  By the way...us Asians aren't all from the same place so it made me really angry when the delivery guy insisted we spoke the same language and wouldn't leave us alone until we spoke \"our language\".  As far as taste go, this was my first time eating Papa John's...and it wasn't the greatest for me."}
{"text":"I sometimes wonder why I put myself through the agony of ordering from this Papa Johns - not the first time this was a disappointing experience.  The pizza is pretty standard Papa Johns - you're not getting anything authentic from any of the big chain pizza shops.  It's quick, easy, and there's usually some type of deal that gets you cheesy bread, chicken, or dessert included. I admit it - when I'm home and too lazy to cook I like a deal.   So I know I'm getting a pretty basic pizza - but i always hope to at least get what I order. Well, don't count on it here. The frustration at this store isn't the actual pizza, it is the lack of attention to the order.  They either don't read the tickets or don't care - not sure which but it's consistently a problem here.   Not too long ago I ordered a pizza and checked the box for \"well done.\"  I like a bit of brown, bubbly cheese to top my pizza.  I also have a deep aversion to any of that squishy raw dough under the cheese.  The store delivered my pizza - not well done and not brown. It actually seemed kinda raw throughout. When I called, they told me that the oven was broken so they couldn't do a well done pizza cause it would burn. How does a pizza shop not have a properly working oven??  And why did they assume that I would be ok with getting a pizza they knew it wasn't prepared to my order?!  Ugh...  Yesterday, again, I ordered a well done pizza but I received a pizza with the cheese barely melted. It was white and pasty looking. Yuck.  The center was mushy and doughy - just like I DONT like it.   The deal was to get an order of cheese sticks with the pizza (for less than the pepperoni pizza by itself?). I ordered it with ranch dip. It, of course, arrived with pizza sauce. At first I thought I forgot to change the default sauce choice, then I saw the side of the box - \"Ranch\".  #Fail #FailAgain  So - I guess if you want a PJ Pizza you have two options. 1) accept that your not getting what you order and move on with it or 2) go pick up your own order so that you can check it and make them fix whatever is wrong before you leave.  Or, you can be like me and choose option 3) don't order from this Papa Johns anymore."}
{"text":"I ordered pizza today and - as always - order it well done. I don't like the raw mushy dough under my cheese and like the cheese nice and brown. My online order quoted 31 minutes at 2:10pm. My order arrived, I had time to taste it, and call the store to complain by 2:27pm.   The cheese was white and barely melted, the crust was white, and the dough in the middle raw. I called the store to complain and was of course offered a remade pizza.  Unfortunately - I didn't have time to wait and was really frustrated anyway.   I was told that the \"oven isn't working,\" and that when they put the oven on \"well done\" it comes out burnt so they can't do it. Well, serving raw pizza isn't really exciting either.  Why does a pizza shop - that clearly requires a working oven - not have ovens that work?  And why would they just assume that I would be ok with eating something that's not what I ordered?  If they were put of pepperoni would they just send me a pizza with chicken?   Also - I can't help but wonder if this is true or they're just not paying attention?  How did my online order transmit, they prepared it, cooked it, boxed it, drove it to me, got it upstairs to my third floor apartment, I signed the bill, got inside, grabbed a drink, sat down, opened the pizza, saw the pizza, still tasted it, and called to complain in less than 20 minutes?!?  The clerk who answered told me that he'd put my name in a log for a free pizza next time. Great - I know I'm already looking forward to my next pizza - NOT!  They should have just refunded my money to my credit card. Why would I want to order again from a store where I doubt their truthfulness?  And if they were telling the truth - why are they operating with a broken oven anyway?    Papa Johns is suffering here y'all. Looks like they're following the same path as the once tasty Pizza Hut and Dominos. I guess it happens - they get too big and can't manage the quality anymore. Might be time to look for the next great pizza chain...  or maybe just stick to a local place."}
{"text":"Love Papa John's. It's our go to pizza place. I highly recommend ordering pan style crust as opposed to regular. Much crispier and delicious. Once you go pan, you never go back. Delivery is also quick and pizza is warm. I accidentally tipped the driver $30 one time and they called me back and gave me a credit, since it was obviously an accident. Honorable."}
{"text":"I would give no stars if that was an option. This place is a joke. They tried to double charge us for their buy one get one free pizza. My husband tried to explain that they were charging too much, but the person taking the orders was not very bright. We ended up at Metro Pizza instead, which was delicious! So, I guess thank you for such ridiculous service Papa John's.  Won't ever attempt to order here again."}
{"text":"This Papa John's at 10217 Charleston is the best of all they always show up on time even early, order is accurate and the pizza is just outstanding. Hats off to Cameron and the crew that works there, thank you so much for a wonderful pie. Cannot be beat, of all the Papa John's in the entire world this one is tops"}
{"text":"Used to love the quality of pizza here. But my last two experiences were horrible! I had a pizza arrive over an hour late and lukewarm with the cheese already cold and firm. The driver gave me some excuse about \"training someone new\".  When I complained they gave me a free coupon for a pizza. I had ordered a second time from the before I got the coupon and this time it came in 30ish min but same deal, it was dry and not so fresh looking. I eat pizza as a cheat meal so when I do have one I want it to taste good! So I will not be ordering from here again. Dominos and Marcos also delivers to my house so going to have to go with them next time. Disappointing, used to love Papa Johns!"}
{"text":"Its pizza time done right, I've been using this location for the past 2 years and they have never disappointed me. When you have to provide a lot of food for a lot of people on a low budge papa John's is a home run. Really good quality pizzas cooked up fresh and ready to be devoured. Great for kids birthdays, office parties, family gatherings etc. I know a lot of folks have some complaints about the delivery service, my rating is based on carry out only. This is my favorite pizza chain, they always have good deals, fresh toppings and prompt service."}
{"text":"This location does it. Nothing but positive experiences here. Huge fan!   When I had trouble with an online order, they corrected it with ease. Their punctuality is on point!"}
{"text":"I hadn't had Papa John's for at least a year.  It's one of the better chain pizza places, and unlike the Domino's that moved, it's conveniently on my way home from work.  I got a $10 gift card for $5 from www.saveology.com and they had their large specialty pizzas for $11.  The large is only 14\" which isn't really large, but the Spinach Alfredo pizza is pretty tasty.  I was disappointed they no longer put the butter sauce and pepporncini in the pizza box, but I understand it.  The service was a little slow as they have two registers but only one person working on one of them with a lot of people standing around.  I'd stop here for a pizza on my way home again if the price was right."}
{"text":"My experience with this Papa John's is the complete opposite of the majority. I don't do much pizza but based on a 'Buy one get one pizza free' deal I volunteered pizza to a gathering I was attending... And this store was the one on my way. So I called and a nice young lady answered the phone and was patient while explaining the current deals. Later I came to the store and found the chaos. I would have never thought of the crazy day the store was having based on her calmness on the phone. It seems there was some kind of school event and they were making pizzas for an army. I was not advised over the phone about the delays in order, but this Papa John's store were on their game. Despite the crazy amount of orders my pizza was pretty much on time and on point."}
{"text":"Bloody lackwits. Have messed up every single order I have ever placed through this particular location. Expect a very long wait for your delivery order, or they may botch it entirely and Rekey it as a pickup. Every time I have gone inside to pick up an order, staff are angry at one another, rolling eyes, and the atmosphere is chaotic and occasionally abusive. 1/5 stars, turdfest."}
{"text":"I've been here two times already and the Staff was very friendly and the pizza was good. Super fast delivery. I'm so glad we got a closer location. I would definitely recommend them to anyone."}
{"text":"After I THOUGHT I had ordered a stack of pizzas for a meeting to be delivered at 11:45 am, I called at noon to inquire as to the whereabouts of our lunch to be told I had placed the order for 11:45 PM - ACK!  Panic! SH**!!!!  Whomever the gentleman was who answered the phone put the pizza makers to work immediately and 9 pizzas and an order of wings were delivered within 30 minutes, smoking hot and correct.  5 stars for the excellent customer service that saved me from being drug out back and beaten like a pinata by the hungry mob of nerds... er um... architects.    Our office orders from this Papa John's quite frequently for meetings and late nights that require the delivery of dinner.  They always get the orders correct, the pizza is always delivered hot and they always bring a stack of plates and napkins - which is nice so we don't have to eat off of legal folders and wipe our hands on our pants.  THANK YOU, PAPA JOHN'S!"}
{"text":"Nice clean place, great service.  Since it's a chain store the food is pretty much the same as at other Papa Johns. I've been to the store twice this week and always got good fast service."}
{"text":"We are only a few days into 2017 and here goes my first one star review. First off, I HATE writing and reviewing a business so low, but, I guess when it's warranted .. that is just what needs to happen. The day of the Rose Bowl, we had our hearts and tummies set on pizza, not pizza from a chain to be honest , but our favorite local places were closed. Enter what is usually our favorite chain for delivery : Papa Johns. This would be our first time ordering from this location near our new home. It will now be our last. We ordered online at 1400 , 2 medium pizzas and an order of 8 wings. We got confirmation of a 30-40 min. delivery time. We realize that could vary either way.  At 1500. my husband called to ask where our pizzas were & was told, ' they would be there any minute!' He even asked about the confirmation online and if that was legit. She really didn't give any answer to him but seemed eager to get off the phone. Thirty  minutes more ; Forty five minutes more ... NO pizza! He calls back & surprise ! He was put on hold. Now after about ten minutes of his hold , I smelled a rat and I called Papa Johns from my phone while he continued to remain on hold and low and behold , THEY answered! I figured they had his number from before on caller ID and although I can not prove that, why did they put him on hold for so long and answer me? Of course, I hand off my phone to my husband and he asks yet again where is the pizza he ordered NOW 2 hours ago? This guy has no answers and seemed to care less. All he said is that it was on its way. We would have canceled the order at this point, but our daughters university was playing in the Rose Bowl and we just wanted the freaking pizza we ordered 2+ hours ago and paid for ( including the tip!) , and not to miss anymore of this game for our hunger! haha  How hard is it to get pizza?? Well, apparently it's very hard for this Papa Johns! The pizza showed up about fifteen minutes after that last call.. the delivery guy was put off with the fact he was not getting any more tip. My husband asked him how long the pizza had been in his car & he said about 'twenty minutes' and 'that he was the only delivery driver that was on'. Not shocked , the pizza was not even remotely warm. The wings were barely warm, which made me nervous as they are poultry and should be kept hot to be safe for eating. Besides having to reheat all of the food , it was bland and not good. Lacking any sort of crisp in the crust.. and was stale tasting. To make it worse , they charged our card twice ! This is after the driver had stated we would have a discount .. instead we spent almost an hour on the phone with Papa Johns corporate when the actual store manager stated they could not refund the double charge!!! Are you kidding me?! Nearly $80 had been put on our card for this crappy pizza and service... I can think of several awesome local places that amount of money could have gone for amazing pizza and even sides! The call to Papa Johns corporate was another hold time of 25 minutes; I just fail to believe a manager did not have the power to refund a charge he saw with receipt . I warn you .. pass on this location. Go anywhere else."}
{"text":"Great franchise.  Consistently good quality and lots of specials.  We have some good pizzas available in our area yet regularly opt for Papa John's more often than not.  Do like their national ads, especially during football season.  They keep their brand out there and once you experience their pies you come back.  Advertising does work.  Glad that they are just a golf cart ride away."}
{"text":"Great service  everytime.  The manager runs a good show. Always very polite.  I live down the road and four then on Yelp so I figured with the great service they have provided every time I go there that they deserve 5 stars."}
{"text":"Of the 20 plus pizza's I ordered only 1 was sub-par, 95% we're pick up, and 98% were fantastic! I will go no where else !"}
{"text":"This is the worst place ever!!! The delivery is late, they are rude, and the delivery guy is the most disrespectful person...."}
{"text":"Today we had the vegetable pizza for the lunch and it is really awesome....  And delivery also done  quickly...."}
{"text":"Great customer service. The manager, David was super helpful and attentive. There was an issue with my delivery and David personally took care of my problem and I didn't have to deal with any extra phone calls or people. Thanks David!"}
{"text":"I ordered at 12:22am, they close at 1am and they called me and told me it would be 2.5 hours for my delivery, so I should cancle, dispite having ordered a full 38 minutes before they close. TWO AND A HALF HOURS?!! I COULD DRIVE TO LA IN 2.5HRS AT 1AM. What horrible customer service. I get pizza at LEAST once a week. I have used 150 papa rewards point since it started. I will be switching to Dominos.   Also, the pizzas dough/crust is  routinely raw in the center dispite ordering them \"well done\"  Update 6-28-18: I have not gone back to this Papa Johns once since posting this review. Dominos has REALLY stepped up their game. The crust is actually better then Papa Johns, and you can order through an app, every pizza gets you points towards a free pizza. I'm really glad this particular Papa Johns sucks so badly, or I may have never switched."}
{"text":"Not sure how busy this place can be, but sometimes I do find the delivery times for delivery orders to be a bit ridiculous. As such, I usually resort to the carryout, since you can specify ahead of time when you want the order ready by (much easier, much better, much more predictable). In general, it's an okay & middle-of-the-road Papa John's with your standard list of pizza options (much easier to check the menu on their website). They do both carryout and delivery, although the delivery times can be a bit unreasonable. Food gotten from here is pretty decent either way so I can't complain about the quality. Great option if you're hosting an event with lots of people and need food for many hungry stomachs."}
{"text":"Papa Johns is my pizza of choice when I choose to order pizza. Thier motto is \"better ingredients, better pizza\", and I have to agree. I have ordered pizza to my home address and also to our office and without fail  not only is the pizza excellent, but the delivery guys are also really nice. They are friendly, pleasant and ontime. I dont know what their training program is at Papa Johns, but they must emphasis customer service as it is always excellent.   The pizza toppings are always fresh and delicious and I find the sauce particularly tasty.  They also have dessert pizza, wings, breadsticks, cheesesticks and drinks.  I have to say that they are more expensive than some of thier competitiors but if I am choosing to order in pizza ( rather than having a frozen one at home), its a nice treat."}
{"text":"What can one say?  This is a great franchise, tightly managed for quality and consistency.  Get a pie in Charlotte or Chula Vista, it will be the same.    Cleanliness is also a by-word with Papa John's.  The stores are immaculate.  and the preparation areas are similarly kept up.  When you walk in, you know you are getting a \"clean\" pie.  And where you have delivery, it arrives hot and not with the toppings slid to one side or the other because it was transported on a level surface.  I especially like the insulated bags that can carry it looks like 5 boxes.    The franchise is also community oriented, both nationally with their support of NFL charities, but also locally.  The founder is a serious Catholic, consequently will not allow support of any anti right-for-life organizations or events.  (Did I get that politically correct without the \"A\" word?)  Good pizzas at reasonable prices.  Look for frequent promotions and remember to ask as you buy your pies if there are any discounts, like for seniors or military, let alone advertisements of which you forgot to bring with you. ;-))"}
{"text":"I order Papa John's when it's cheap and convenient, like the day after the Checkers win when online orders are half-price.  I usually go to the Fort Mill one, but this was my first time here.  The pizza for the most part is what you would expect.  It's mediocre franchise pizza \"baked\" on a conveyor belt.   I like sauce, but they put entirely too much sauce on mine, so much that it was coming through the cheese.  They forget the blue cheese for my chicken poppers, and those are just frozen chicken nuggets ran through the conveyor oven - definitely not a better ingredient.  The worst part was the experience.  The store was very busy and chaotic.  I worked for a few different Domino's Pizza franchises so I know what this is like.  The manager was yelling at employees if the phone rang more than one ring and wasn't answered.  I can understand that, but when there are six people in the store and you're yelling at your employees, you're pissing off six customers instead of just the one that is calling.  I'll stick to the Fort Mill location next time.    P.S.  Dough that comes on a truck is not fresh, nor is it a \"better ingredient.\""}
{"text":"Well let start off by saying I along with others have been a papa John,s fan for many years. I have not eaten here in 18 years I now have no regrets after tonight. So we ordered delivery a month ago and the pizza was cold,soggy and not cut Chicago style. We called and got a free order for next time. Tonight we took the opportunity and decided to try again. This amounted to a \"WET\" dough pizza. I took it 8 miles back to business. The young kid working there was on the phone so I waited. When he got off the phone I had the box open so he could see it. He got off the phone and literally stated \" What do you want\" I was beside myself. I stated well what I want is to get mad. He told me he has the right to tell me to leave if I get mad lol. Well all I can do is commit to never eating papa johns again. NYPD, BJ,s Rosatis it will be. Dominos and little Caesar's at least cooks there pizza and has better customer service."}
{"text":"Papa Johns is a great pizza business. I think the fact that they add garlic and sauce dip with your pizza really bought me, I love dipping the crust in something. Their bread sticks are good too if you're looking for a good addition. They're not very expensive when it comes to pizza. If you want cheap poorly made pizza try Pizza Hut. Personally I like Donatos more, but because they are so local I often buy from these guys."}
{"text":"This is the worst pizza place ever... If I could give them a -1 star I certainly would... The customer service is horrible, the pizza took over 2 1/2 hours for delivery abd they are full of excuses and nobody owns up to anything... One gentleman told me he would refund my card after they messed up my order and took so long to deliver, that I would need to wait 3 to 5 business days to see the refund... A week and a half later there is no refund and now I have to be inconvenienced with going to the location to get my refund... In which only one person in the entire store can process... So I have to schedule a time with one specific person..   I willllll neverrrrrrrrrr order from here again and I urge you to stay away!!!!!"}
{"text":"I like Papa John's Pizza. Taste pretty good. toppings are plentiful. sauce is Tangy. I tried to order online this time for the first time ever. I was given a coupon for 50% off, website said not valid. Oh well, thought I'd order it anyway. When I got to the checkout they wanted $6 for delivery. WTF? On top of that they wanted $2.26 for something called door and dash quality assurance or some crap like that. That means my delivery was $8.26? On top of that I'm a decent Tipper. Add 5 bucks to that and we're looking at $13.26 extra for a $15 Pizza. Papa John's can suck a butt. Definitely going elsewhere"}
{"text":"Atrocious. Possible the most expensive mainstream pizza I have ever ordered, next to no cheese or meat. Usually pizza this bad is at least two-for-one, just pay the extra couple bucks and get good pizza from a mom/pop place people.  I honestly think I could have eaten a cardboard box with some spaghetti sauce on it and enjoyed it more than what this outfit produces."}
{"text":"Amazing ownership investment.  The team at my local papa johns makes masterpieces.  I ordered a half pineapple bell pepper and onion and half steak, jalapeño and onion pie last night. The kids got their extra sauce and extra cheese pizza that ignited smiles. Thank Pappa John!"}
{"text":"Omg you guys can't get anything right to save your lives.  Waiting for our free pizza cuz you screwed up our last one.  The driver gave us the wrong one and left.  Now we're waiting for THAT replacement and I'm starving and now we have to tip 2 drivers!!!  Incompetent."}
{"text":"Awfully disappointed. Placed an online order even though I live walking distance away. I called the store to confirm they had my gate code access. In the past, drivers had a hard time getting in. So for their convenience I was looking out for the driver and called to be proactive. The employee who answered the phone asked for my number and said they had the access code and my cell # he said the pizza was just about to leave. An hour goes by still no pizza.... I called the store again and same guy answers saying the driver had a hard time getting in and that he called my cell. I had no missed call and I was standing outside my condo gate so I would of seen the papa john's delivery car. I asked to be connected with the driver so I could assist him with navigating. Again I live 3 minutes away from the store. The poor driver was lost and his phone was navigating him to the hotel across the street.  After an hour and a half... the pizza finally arrives. He was very sweet and I made sure to tip him since it wasn't his fault. I was told I would get refunded which the store guy never processed. I called today and a nice lady answered and assisted me with the refund. Said it was never done but she would be happy to do it. Customer service is key!"}
{"text":"Well, if you are reading a review of a national pizza chain franchise you are probably just concerned about information relating to this SPECIFIC location.  I have never had a problem here.  The food is exactly the same passable pizza as any other Papa John's.  The service is fine as well.  The other reviewers aren't wrong though.  This shop does seem to be run by a bunch of high school kids.  Every time I go in there are maybe two working and the rest are just sitting around.  HOWEVER, I have never had a problem here.  I have no problem recommending it.  Just make sure you order online and USE THEIR COUPONS.  Papa John's retail prices are ridiculous."}
{"text":"Good pizza, sometimes the service stinks, but I suppose they make it up with fresh ingredients."}
{"text":"Puts the pepperoni completely underneath the cheese which I have never experienced before. I always assumed it went sauce, cheese, then pepperoni but not at this place. It's a petty complaint but I look forward to crispy pepperoni and instead it's soggy and hidden under a ton of cheese. It's just disappointing..."}
{"text":"I am really annoyed and gave just ended my love affair with Papa Johns. I had a \"credit\" due to a mishap w/a bad delivery. I finally called to collect and just got a nasty phone call from someone saying the driver had been to my place and why didn't I answer the door in a very foul tone. To which I responded, why didn't the driver ring the bell or call him/herself???? Seriously, so much drama for mediocre pizza. And the driver just said he knocked a few times. Ring the bell or call of no one responds!!!! Maybe I didn't hear it??? I'm done w/you Papa Johns and thank you."}
{"text":"Avoid this Papa John's at all cost! The manager there Jody sent me a pizza burnt on the bottom, I mean black and then gave me an attitude when I sent him pictures of it. This particular location gives Papa John's a bad name, by looking at the other reviews it seems there are a lot of unhappy customers."}
{"text":"I should have known better. I told myself I was not coming back here but I did. I ordered 5 pizzas and they told me to arrive within 30 minutes. Ok cool, arrive in 40 minutes and my pizzas weren't ready. I pre-paid the pizzas and tipped them as well. Waited another 15 minutes. The guy was unprofessional and didn't really care about service. The pizzas looked liked no one cared about their job. I'm ver disappointed and will never come back to this place.  Don't, just don't come to this location.."}
{"text":"This is the third or fourth time we have ordered from this location .  In Colorado papas was my favorite pizza.  I paid 27.00 dollars for a large veggie.  It arrived Luke warm at best.  Crust was like cardboard, sauce was tasteless, and toppings were scant.  Even after we warmed it up and I added my own spices, we couldn't eat it and threw it away.  Ended up going to papa Murphys.  Very disappointed .  The only positive was our delivery person was very nice and polite.  We will not be ordering from this store again."}
{"text":"Hey great service out of this location. From the guy who took my order and was very good at it, to the driver who called me 15mins in advance 2 give me a heads up and called again when he got to my hotel at the nobu. I am a former papa johns GM and i must say Bacon cheese burger pizza was a solid 9.5 on the pizza grade scale.  Great job guys. Very impressed. Keep it up."}
{"text":"Worst Papa John's in Las Vegas I ordered for delivery.  The price was ridiculous $30 for a K are one topping and 16 wings but whatever we were hungry. Ordered half bbq wings and half buffalo easy right. Okay after an hour the driver gets to the house all the wings are buffalo. Okay no big deal maybe they will give me a discount oh no that was to much to ask for mind you my 6 old son can't have buffalo but who cares. The manager called me a liar and said I never in formed her and only the distract manager could discount.  Really geez I guess we were born yesterday.  I've worked for a pizza place don't give me that then she told me to give the food back to the driver. Or pay full price since I didn't want a credit. Can I say customer service.  Needless to say will never order from this location."}
{"text":"This is one of the best papa john's that I ever had I deal with. One thing that impresses me is the delivery time. My last pizza arrived in less than 25 minutes when I was quoted 45 minutes to an hour.   The pizza was so hot I had to let it sit so I could actually bite it."}
{"text":"Well where do I begin.  Not a single person knew of the specials  that were listed online.  It took 3 calls to get them to take the order.   That should have been the sign to go somewhere else.   We place the order for pickup since the delivery time was a hour.   I arrived at the store to pick order about 20 minutes later and my order was complete.   I waited and waited to be checked out come to find that not a single person could ring on the registrer since the General Manager had left to do a delivery and was signed on the registrer.    I had to wait till he returned over 20 minutes to pay.   Not a single apology.    After all that my food was cold and honesty the Worst pizza I have ever had.    We will not ever return"}
{"text":"Last minute addition: So I just found out that there's a UNCC football game tonight and I arrived 10min before half-time. I'll give them the benefit of the doubt with an extra star, but they should be used to this and staff up better.   ---  They're having a rough night...  This is an extremely busy location and unfortunately being right across the street from the college they don't very aparently don't have much dedicated talent to pick staff from.  Came in 20 minutes after ordering Take-out, estimated time was 15. I'm up to 30 and while sitting at the waiting bench I watch 4 delivery drivers walk in and step over a dozen to-go menus that one of them knocked over; no one cares to pick up the trip hazard.  Another customer comes in with boxes and says her order is wrong and just wants a refund, I'm assuming she's been through this before. No one seems to want to give it to her. Glad I paid with an AMEX, if I had the same issue I wouldn't argue one bit for a refused refund, just take it up with my card issuer.  Took another 10 minutes to write this review, 40 minutes so far and every so often a different person will ask what I'm waiting on then dissappear. I guess when you have the largest university campus in the Charlotte-metro next door you don't have to give any form of service ; your customer base will all be brand new in the fall anyway! Too bad I'm a long term local wanting a decent pizza place for my family. I'll look elsewhere."}
{"text":"It really stinks that this place has such terrible service from start to finish bc I like the pizza. Once 2 years ago I ordered a pie on site and it took 45 minutes they probably forgot about it until I asked 30 minutes into the ordeal; I had 2 hungry kids waiting with me. Awful I tried to forgive it and tried it again today. No greeting, no receipt, it would be 15 minutes they said for a pie that was half mushroom half sausage. Why no receipt? Is that so I can't complain about terrible service? It was 25 minutes and the toppings were mixed so the person who doesn't eat meat had possibly 2 pieces that weren't sausage topped. I said \"that's definately not half and half. They offered to re-make it, but I didn't feel the time investment was worth it. How hard was it to make it right the first time really? Two strikes you're out."}
{"text":"Nice young lady took order. She was new. The problem is the loud mouth who kept talking while I was trying to give my order. Shut up. Let me speak then train. Also screwed Order up. No thin crust on small. Shame on you. 14.00 two small. Really. I want to apologize to yelp for not checking the reviews prior to spending my hard earned money here. Lesson learned!"}
{"text":"Have tried to like this store, but last order was horrendous. A special XL pizza. I'm thinking, ok one more try.  As Usual I was disappointed. The typical Papa John's way to save money - half crust with very little toppings. Pizza was not hot, ok , but it looked like it had been thrown around back seat.  Very disappointing.  Only positive is drivers are usually nice.  Done with these guys."}
{"text":"We placed an order for delivery last night online and not even 20 min later our doorbell was ringing. The pizza was piping hot, exactly how we ordered and very tasty!  Kudos!!"}
{"text":"Fast delivery, great service, hot pizza! Better than pizza hut and dominos for sure."}
{"text":"This will be the last time I order pizza here. This is the second time we get sick by ordering here. I walked in after ordering online and still had to wait about 10 min for me to get the pizza. The customer in front of me was having  a very difficult time placing order with the staff. I came home with The Works pizza and the pizza was soggy. After about 15-20 min our stomach starting to hurt. Bad very bad experience. Placed my concern on their website and never heard from them. DO NOT ORDER from this location."}
{"text":"I have ordered here a few times ONLY because it's the only place that will deliver to my home, the pizza is not bad although it's not one of my favorites. I tried twice to order for delivery on line and was never given a option to have it delivered only for carry out. So I assumed the deals I was trying to get weren't offered for delivery and just decided to call in at 6:55 I made the call, after a long painful call with someone who claimed to be new I got my order made (same order I tried to place on line) double the on line price. When I brought up the problem I was having trying to make a on line order delivery I was given a 1-800# for costumer service ( that was given to people with the same issues). I didn't want to call at this point I just want my pizza. I'm told the price and it will be 1 hr. Also annoying but I said ok. After 1 hour and a half I call to see were my pizza is. They girl that answers say oh your driver is in route and should be there in 15 min. I said ok but they said 1 hr at this point it will be 1hr 45 min. She said hold on.. After being on hold for 3 min I'm told actually your order was never made. Wait! what!!!!! You just told me it was in route!!!! Sooooo I made the order 1 more time and was told I would get 1 pizza for free. But I have to wait 45 min. For it to get here. I hope it makes it.  You suck. I would never use you ever again if other places would deliver to me. Note to self never run out of frozen pizzas again."}
{"text":"Papa John's serves up hot, fresh, and delicious pizzas for cheap.  Get in on the online special offers action if you have computer access.  You'll have an almost 100% guarantee that your order will be come out right the first time!  The staff at this location are super friendly and parking is a breeze.  You'll be in and out in no time at all!  The Tuscan Six Cheese & Italian Herb Cheesesticks are my personal favorite."}
{"text":"Waiting for my pizza right now, 2 stars because I haven't even try the pizza. I decided to try this place,  the lady that helped me not very friendly. After I ordered I realized there is a deal and I can save about $5, which she didn't offer I ask if I could change it and she wasn't happy about it. Just because I'm already here and my family is hungry I'm waiting. But I'm not coming back again."}
{"text":"I ordered 4 pizzas and boneless chicken wings I got chicken nuggets btw the pizza was nasty I spent 57$ and threw more than half in the trash I thought I was getting better quality by going to papa john but I'm disappointed and out my money should have went to dominoes instead"}
{"text":"We tried this restaurant out due to an ad on Instagram, and our deep dish pizza was delicious.   I would highly recommend this place to anyone."}
{"text":"Ordered a small pepperoni and sausage pizza with onions and olives. Tastes delicious and the pizza delivery guy came in 15 minutes!!!"}
{"text":"Always extremely fast delivery and with their app you can usually get by with 50% off. Love their pizza!"}
{"text":"Always fresh just like the commercial says. Just delivery is slow and I'm right down the street so I always pick it up"}
{"text":"Very friendly staff and very fast delivery!! If you just want to relax at home and not cook ... Give them a call they will rush some great pizza and sides right to you."}
{"text":"Got a pizza few weeks ago. .went to get new one. .still doughy. .phone guy wasn't really nice. .I won't go back."}
{"text":"Got food poisoning (really sick at least ) from a chicken mushroom pizza and when I've tried to call other nights sometimes no one picks up   Not a good location to get food"}
{"text":"I've ordered delivery twice for papa John's.  both times my pizza was delivered at room temperature. The second pizza was even free courtesy of the manager because of it. and both times I was told that it would take 45-60mns and took close to 2hrs. I was accommodated for my dissatisfaction, so the reason for me writing this is not to come down on the staff, but there needs to be a change. Maybe they need to hire more people or whatever unless they want to keep giving away free pizzas."}
{"text":"Not a fan of this location. Their service is ridiculously slow. Example: I ordered online today and received my confirmation at 8:53. It is currently 9:00. Still no pizza. *door bell rings* cancel that, 9:00 on the nose. One hour and 7 minutes since order. So much for a 30-40 minute promise time."}
{"text":"What the hell happened to Papa John's? I used to eat pizza from these guys all the time when I was living over in Southern California. Now that I have been in Vegas about 4 years, this is the first I have had it since then.  For starters, the dough has changed. I dont know exactly what it is but, for some reason it did not taste the same like I was used to back in Cali. The dough seemed bland and a bit dry. The toppings werent as plentiful and as fresh as it used to be.  Maybe its because I ordered 3 large pizzas for delivery about half an hour before they closed? Maybe they were just getting ready to close soon and really did not worry too much about my order? Sad to think it but yeah, maybe I was getting whatever dough that was left since the morning. I also think that I am spoiled from going to Old School Pizzeria, Metro Pizza, Napoli's and Grimaldi's.  The only thing that has not changed are the little Garlic Butter thingies that you can dip your pizza bread into and the peppercini's (sp?).   What I ordered was 2 large pepperonis and 1 large Ham and Pineapple. I also orderd cheesy breadsticks as a side. I hate to say it, but the hot n ready pepperoni pizza at Little Caesars I had last weekend was better. The cheesy breadsticks were ok.  Customer service and delivery were decent. They showed up as promised by the eta that was given.   Overall, not sure if I want have Papa John's again. Maybe I just caught them at a bad time. Everybody has their moments I guess. If I order from these guys again and it is better or heaven forbid worse, then an update is necessary.  Yelp 2014 365 Review Challenge #111"}
{"text":"Avoid this location. The employees are unprofessional and the service is lacking. Let's be real, if you're eating Papa John's, your expectations aren't that high so when it's exceptionally bad, it warrants a review. I ordered a Hawaiian BBQ pizza through grub hub and it was delivered quicker than the estimated time. Yay! After I plopped down to dig in, I found that I had received a mere original BBQ chicken pizza. Checked both receipts and saw that it was wrong on Papa John's side so I called and spoke with the manager, Courtney. He/she was very unpleasant and our conversation was somewhat comical. Me: blah,blah, sad face no pineapple. Mgr: then why did you eat any of it? Me: because there is fresh pizza in my face and I was getting hangry. The mgr was very argumentative and still didn't offer any customer service after he/she said that he/she entered the order and did so incorrectly. My quest for greasy pizza beer soak was approaching an unhappy ending. That is...until I contacted grubhub. Hooray! They called the location and I was issued a credit for my anti-Hawaiian pizza."}
{"text":"I called this location 3 times and was put on hold for 10 min each time. Poorly staffed, and poor customer service. I understand it was 9:30 and night but 30 min hold is excessive!"}
{"text":"I was surprised at the pizza tracker and its accuracy with my order. My kids and I were watching the process from start to finish. We were pleasantly surprised when we arrived to pick up our order, of the quick service and courteous employees. One gentlemen working there opened the door for me and the other stopped what he was doing to greet me and get my order.   And the pizza was fresh, hot and delicious"}
{"text":"I am a regular customer here and always order Chicken and Jalapeno Pizza. Never had any issues.  I used a promo code NOWPJ as I received at my home and ordered a Chicken and Veggie Pizza on 6th Jan 2016 around 1 pm.  I came home and ate few slices. After eating few slices, rightaway I started getting sharp pain in my stomach, right after eating the pizza but then went away in 45 mins.  I called the store and they informed me that this has never happened to them. I explained it to them that I can bring the Pizza back and you guys can test it. Also I did bought the pizza back  After work in the evening I got another pizza which Najiba cooked and it was great no complaints. My wife and myself loved it.   Regarding the complaint, Papa johns downtown 17 ave location SW said that someone will get back to you on Sunday. I called the store as no one called me back and they informed me go ahead and complaint to papa johns headoffice and we cannot give you money back. I do not need money back. I just need to get a good pizza what i paid for and I did return my pizza to them to do further testing. There was no owner or manager who got back to me. There was a philipino gentlemen mentioned that you should provide doctor certificate and we can take some action. Are you serious...  Horrible customer service, who does not beleive in serving customers and tell us to go ahead and make an official complaint and thats what i am doing."}
{"text":"Ordered 2 pizzas at 6:30 with an estimated time to arrive of 40 ish minutes.....called at 7:30 and was told they were on the way. It's now 8:00 and nothing has shown up...I live 1.5 miles away...very disappointed since all the other places I have live the Papa Johns has been excellent....guess I'll call again and see about a refund. Get your pizza elsewhere.  **Called the business and was told the drivers car breaks down all the time. Though the driver that finally got her at 8:10 said another delivery employee got lost and went to Osborn and not to my street (near Indian School Rd).  They put two free pizza into the system for my next order but I think I will just go get them and be done with this location.  The pizzas were kind of warm but I am to busy at the moment to deal with this anymore.   Just wanted to warn you!"}
{"text":"This is my first time ordering from papa johns I customized my pizza to pan and well done I don't like doughy tasting pizza I like it crisp when it was delivered it was NOT well done by any means and the pizza was not even cut! We had to cut it into slices ourselves!"}
{"text":"On Sunday, March 5, at 5:33 pm I placed an order, 495583114. The email stated I could expect delivery within 27 to 37 minutes. The pizza should have been delivered by 6:10 pm.  I checked the status of the order at approximately 6:20 pm. The status showed as complete. The driver finally showed up on the property at 6:30 pm. He placed calls to my cell at 6:29, 6:30 and 6:37. He called the security cell phone at 6:38 pm and stated that he had been waiting in the parking lot for 30 minutes trying to deliver the pizza. I am tired of receiving cold pizza. I am tired of not being able to receive the pizza hot, and during the time when it is promised. I have no way to properly reheat a pizza. This would have been the third pizza I received, that would have been cold. Just refund the $14.95 that was charged to my account.  ALL I CAN SAY IS DO NOT ORDER USING THE APP, THERE IS NO REFUND EVEN WITH NO DELIVERY. Order, IF YOU MUST, and pay in cash only. I am still waiting for a refund. I have sent two emails and they sent me an email response, from a Lavelle Gonzalez, offering a refund. Four days ago. Still waiting for a refund or an email."}
{"text":"I would put a zero but it doesn't let me. Worst place ever. Stay away. Go to another one but not this one. Paid $22 for a large two topping and the special was for $10. The manager supposedly put the difference as store credit for next time I ordered. I call now and the credit wasn't there and the manager who answered was very rude. He didn't even attempt to help. Rude store."}
{"text":"This location used to be the best....ordered a thin crust pepperoni and mushroom which was always a pleaser! Not last night...I'm writing because it's not a one off and hear is why...they changed the cheese and put way too much on so grease runs off the slices. The sauce is sweeter and they used to automatically square cut in which slices are small and east to handle! I had a few bites of one slice and threw the rest away!"}
{"text":"Very disappointed in this location. Not only have they messed up our order the past 5 times, but they have also delivered us other people's orders as well. As expensive as their food is for a chain store they should focus on getting their orders right the first time."}
{"text":"The vegetarian pizza is fantastic. I would love it if they added artichoke hearts though. Pizza was delivered hot and fast. Great quality. I like the app."}
{"text":"Papa Johns @ EMR. Great place to pick up pizza when you're in a hurry.  Papa johns app makes it easier to order.  Be sure to order online they have better specials than if you call.  Enjoy the pizza!"}
{"text":"The pizza is good, not spectacular, but better than average. What makes it a four is that they put a lot of toppings on the walk in pizza deal and the pizza comes with free garlic sauce which is definitely a plus! The garlic sauce is really garlicky, more watery than creamy, yet the garlic taste was quite concentrated, it was great! The customer service is also nice, friendly and speedy.  The crust is all right, but I prefer pizza hut's crust.  I didn't see any free toppings such as garlic, which is a con. To add spices such as crushed peppers or Italian seasoning costs extra, unlike other pizza places.  They also don't have quick pizza slices to take on the go. I wanted a slice but since they didn't have any, I took the large walk in pizza special."}
{"text":"I'm going to give you one fucking star! One measly little star! That's right faggots!"}
{"text":"EWWW!! WARNING: So the crust is gross and its so expensive for one pizza!!!! Do not come here.. You will regret it"}
{"text":"This location has great tasting Pizza. It always is consistant and fresh.  The only issue is the have the worst customer service over the phone. I call often for carry out and some times just want to hang up; however when you walk into the Pizza Shop everyone is always so friendly. This location always makes my Pizza just right. So I bypass the one negative thing. They offer a $4.99 carry-out special for a Medium Pizza. You can not beat that it is cheaper than the frozen Pizza's at the grocery store.   I can give them a pat on the back. I have been eating at this location for years and it is always VERY clean."}
{"text":"When I walked inside to get my order no one greeted me or rang me out for several minutes , the guy manager with the long hair was extremely rude and looked very dirty"}
{"text":"Placed my order pizza was over cooked and made wrong. Asked for lite sauce and extra cheese there was a ton of sauce on it and seemed not to have extra cheese. Staff inside were not friendly at all. Could hear someone causing in the back. That about the way people are driving today. (Must of been a delivery driver.)  I had my Daughter with me and she could hear him. Not happy at all."}
{"text":"Crushed to learn that the $7 one topping carryout special has gone the way of the dinosaurs.  It was what separated PJ's from the other cheap pizza chains.  I'm crying real tears, here."}
{"text":"Basic fast food Pizza service. Nothing that great about their parmesian garlic breadsticks or pizza. The breadsticks were slightly overcooked and the parmesian and garlic didn't really stick with the breadsticks; it slid off and collected at the bottom of the box. The pizza was alright I actually like Dominoes or Little Cesar's believe it or not. However I do like the Papa John's Pizza sauce better. Also they were a bit more costly at $28 for a side of okay to mediocre dry flavorless breadsticks and a pizza which wasn't even a large. Eh...."}
{"text":"Make sure you check online for the specials they offer. I drove in and asked the kid behind the counter if they had any large pizza specials. He said no very confidently.  I ordered a large one topping for 17.03 after tax for carryout. I go online and look at the specials for this specific papa John's and there's a 1 large, 2 topping pizza for 7.99. I show the manager and she said I was supposed to order it online but it said on the website it was a carryout special not an online special so that was bullshit. These people don't seem to care."}
{"text":"Every time we order, it's great. It's our favorite fast food pizza. The thin crust is crispy and perfect.  Yum-o!"}
{"text":"This was the first pizza place in Las Vegas that we ended up actually liking. Ordered take out twice... never messed up our food and never disappoints. Will def be eating there again in the near future! thumbs up!"}
{"text":"Despite the poor reviews we had to try this place....they're open on Christmas. That's already a really tough thing for the employee's but Christmas Eve left overs were not happening tonight. I placed my order online for carry out because I figured it would be quicker....good thing I don't get paid for figuring stuff :-/ . The guy at the register was as nice as he could considering the fact that he was working the front counter,  answering phones,  and making dough between assisting customers.  The wait was probably longer then usual because so many people had the same bright idea that I had to order Za on Christmas.  Either way the grub is always good so they are a solid 3 star's for me."}
{"text":"I absolutely LOVE Papa John's Pizza - and it is my \"go to\" choice! So why am I giving it only 1 star? Because of the way they handle promotions. See, I'm not complaining about the quality of their pizza - because I didn't have any? Why didn't I have any pizza but I am still giving them a bad rating? Because I was driving home and wanted to pick up a yummy Papa John's Pizza, but the promotion is only available if I order online. When I said \"I don't want to go home to order it and then go back out\", I was told \"sorry\". So, on principle alone, I ordered Pizza Hut because they give me the same promotion whether I go online, use their app, phone them or walk-up. And the pizza was delicious at Pizza Hut!! So I'll be giving them my business. Papa John's: please give your customers the promotion regardless of how it's ordered - do you want my business or not? It's pizza, not anything that special. And although I'm told that ordering online improves accuracy, it doesn't (your app is horrible). What it does is save you on having to hire someone to answer the phone. Fix this!"}
{"text":"Ordered my pizza 6 cheese with sausage and pepperoni, garlic knots, brownie and cherry pepsi.  Those garlic knots are super good.  I dare not share those.  The pizza was very good too."}
{"text":"PAPA PASSES THE BUCK Never again will I buy Papa Johns pizza. Everything that could go wrong, went wrong, and I only live a few blocks away. The pizza, when it arrived, I could have used it as a throwing disc. It was overcooked, hard, and overpriced for the size of a large. Thank GOD there is Rocco's Pizza, never had any problems there, they just don't deliver. I would starve first before ever eating another Papa Johns Pizza. That is it"}
{"text":"Its Papa Johns so they are pretty standard taste wise across the board.  I ordered online from this location on Saturday night and the prices were reasonable to feed 3 adults and 2 kids.  They said it would take 30-40 minutes to arrive, but honestly it felt like 15 minutes has passed and the doorbell was ringing, definitely a plus.  Its super convenient to my sisters house so I am sure we will order from them again when we don't feel like wrangling her kids up and taking them out to eat!"}
{"text":"I ordered a veggie pizza with cinnamon knots. When I went to get my pizza they gave me the wrong pizza with all the meet toppings in it, I didnt notice it until I took a bite out of the first slice while I was going to start my car. I have been vegetarian all my life and I am really angry at their carelessness. I was starting to like papa johns but after this incident, no more. And the veggie pizza they gave me after the mistake was all soggy and bland. I hope they hire people who are good at what they are supposed to be doing.  That pizza had beef in it and has caused me lot of mental anguish. I might forgive them but not forget. This has never happened to me in any of the pizza chains I have been to. Please avoid this place."}
{"text":"I live in Brunswick and this is a great place! They do a good job at making sure it's done right and fast, I think the staff is decent and works hard when they put their mind to it."}
{"text":"How can you go wrong with a fast food pizza place that is just an assembly line of orders?  After a long weekend I didn't want to cook and it was too late to go get some food so I ordered a pizza.  I figured, it's 10:30pm and I just wanted to eat something so I ordered from Papa Johns.  When I received the confirmation e-mail it said that it was going to arrive in 30 minutes!  Needless to say I just wanted a slice since I was super hungry.  It was getting so late on a Saturday night that I almost fell asleep.  This pizza didn't show up until 12:15am!!!  Seriously? An 1:45 minutes for a pizza that is less than one mile from my place. I was so hungry at this point I almost didn't care that it took so long.  But nobody called to say it was going to be late and the pizza showed up ice cold! There is no way I was going to reheat a pizza that just showed up at my door.  It was obviously cooked right when I ordered it and just sat there for over an hour before it was delivered.  This is the last time I will ever put a tip on my order when I place it online! Terrible service and an ice cold pizza!  No explination.  No sorry for the long wait.  Never again!  Does anyone have the number for Pizza Hut?"}
{"text":"I would give it a zero if there was an option .. Waited 2 hours for a delivery and called them wheres our pizza OHHhh its been delivered are you kidding me.... we cancelled the orders and NEVER AGAIN BEFORE YOU DELIVER CHECK THE CORRECT ADDRESS....."}
{"text":"I ordered a Spinach pizza, garlic cheese knots, and a 2-liter from this store on Easter Sunday, (which I felt guilty about, being a service industry person myself... We know it sucks to work on holidays), but was so glad with the experience.  My driver was quick, on top of knowing what I ordered and so friendly and sweet.  He made me smile, and seemed to care very much about doing a great job, (which he did). I ordered online, and was able to track my food via their website before it arrived as well.  It was in perfect condition when it came and my son and I had a wonderful pizza night together. Nice work, Papas!"}
{"text":"So I figured I'd give them a chance again. It's been at least six months.   Now I remember why.   I ordered pizza, cheese sticks and one of the cookie pizzas. I opened the breadsticks and was greeted with flat dough with some cheese. So I decided to try the pizza.   Too much cheese and too much sauce. (Not to mention the sauce was yucky). So I scrape all the toppings off the pizza and decide to eat the dough and the garlic dip. It was edible, but not necessarily enjoyable.   Didn't try the cookie pizza, but they can't possibly screw that up right????   So for $32 (food, delivery charge + tip) I was not satisfied!"}
{"text":"Ordered from this location several times and it always takes 15-30  minutes longer than they say and food arrives cold."}
{"text":"If I could give this store 0 starts I would. It started when me and my husband ordered 2 pizzas online and stated they would be ready in 20 minutes. We headed over to the store and waited another 20 minutes for them to finish the pizzas, only to find out that one of the pizzas we ordered were sent out for delivery in error. They then proceeded to ask us if we wanted to stay another 20 minutes to wait for another pizza. We declined and they offered us a raincheck for a pizza we had already paid for, rather then refunding us. They told us we had to call in customer service to get some sort of credit, we called customer service and talked to a dispatcher who said she would call us back within 24 hours to resolve our problem and never heard back. Do not order at this location."}
{"text":"Went to pick up pizzas one night and walked in to an employee shoving cheese into his mouth...with his bare hands. It was disgusting and he knew he was caught. Contacted corporate and the manager and no response. Terrible service and disgusting atmosphere. Go else where."}
{"text":"If your lookin for a good price, and not so much quality, then yea. This is definitely the place for you. Unless you are drunk, then I'm sure it tastes awesome.  I've never had a good pizza from here, the toppings fall off before you can even pick to your slice.  We usually pick up our own pizza since its on the way, but the pizza seems like its been sitting out longer than the allotted 25 min.  Also, the chicken *poppers* are more like chicken nuggets, and not tasty at all."}
{"text":"Wow! Probably a good thing I didn't see the reviews before stopping by here earlier today! I never would have gone!  All in all, it wasn't nearly that bad for us. We just picked up a chicken pizza and the service was okay. There was a guy answering the phones that didn't acknowledge me, but than the manager stepped in to help me. Good recovery.  The pizza was pretty good and the price was right at 9 bucks. Nothing to write home to Mom about, but it got the job done.  In the future, I think I will just pick up the pizza instead of taking a chance on the delivery lol  so, not that bad...not all that great....so...  3 stars"}
{"text":"very bad service..... not friendly....  both STORE and ONLINE.... very bad service....  update 7.10.16 called to place an order.... take 10 rings to answer then hold another 2 mins.... hopefully this will be my last order... just trying to use up the giftcard....  bye bye papa john...."}
{"text":"I had ordered for delivery after one hour the driver called said he got the wrong address and it will be another 30 mins. I had called and talked to Chris the manager and all he got for a reply was \"what do you want me to do about it? \" . By far the worst customer service. Very disappointed for a company this big to hire such an incompetent employee as a manager."}
{"text":"Pizza got here completely destroyed and not edible. 20 bucks after delivery and tip. Really disappointed. Pizza was cold also!"}
{"text":"I just double fisted two slices of pizza...THAT'S how good it was.   Prior to today, I have never tried Papa Johns pizza. We've been ordering from Pizza Hut for years, but decided to go with Papa Johns today after hearing about their $11 promo for any large pizza, up to 7 toppings or any specialty. We thought the Pizza Hut $10 large 1 topping was a deal, so our minds practically exploded when we started making our $11 pizza on the Papa Johns website.   We ended up getting the Spinach Alfredo specialty pizza, but also added chicken, bacon, and mushrooms on top. The order came out to $14.59 because of the tax and delivery fee and was delivered with 2 minutes to spare!  We opened up the box and took in the mouth watering aroma of mushrooms, bacon, cheese, and chicken. Then we practically ripped it apart like savages (after I took pics of course). The cheese was just perfect, as Roxi V. described below \"slightly browned and melted.\" The toppings were spread out evenly and, surprisingly, they even gave us a small container of garlic dip. Many other pizza joints will charge you for any dipping sauces.   As for the taste, it was almost like having spinach artichoke dip on a pizza. I was pretty amazed at how they were able to make every single topping stand out in its own way; nothing stood out more than another.The crust was perfectly soft on the inside and browned on the outside.  I don't see how I could go back to Pizza Hut after Papa John's has won my heart."}
{"text":"Waited for over an hour on my delivery which was a small pizza, estimated time was 30 minutes.  When I called the man that answered the phone was very rude, he said I've gotten the same call every two minutes.  Obviously the store is understaffed. He said my pizza was there waiting for the next delivery driver to get back.  When I asked to steak to a manager he hung up on me. Horrible service!"}
{"text":"The manager of this store also owns a towing company and has a history of towing poor college student's scooters for parking out front even when they are picking up pizza there.  Seems like the manager just works there to generate revenue for her towing company not Papa Johns.  Shameful tactic to make money"}
{"text":"This is really great pizza. It's very flavorful and enjoyed by my kids. The price is also right and the service great. I've gotten a few free pizzas through their points system. The chicken wings are also great."}
{"text":"Ordered our pizzas online. And I ordered my fav double pepperoni and some places that I've ordered from when you say double pepperoni they only put regular pepperoni. But this papa John's Made my pizza freaking perfect with tons of pepperoni how I love it. Best pizza ever thankyou so much whoever created my pizza. Your a pizza God!!"}
{"text":"Congratulations!  You've just set the record for serving the absolute smallest amount of ingredients on a pizza ever! Thanks for charging me for a four topping pizza and essentially delivering a cheese pizza for the same price.  Awesome and never calling you again."}
{"text":"Papa is my favorite pizza place that's like fast food pizza. They are down the street so I always get my food quick and I love that I can order online and get points to a free pizza, makes it worth while to me. :)"}
{"text":"Ordered and paid for product.. when I got the pizza it was missing the mushrooms. Called the store and the kid tried to say he had the wrong phone number... too bad it's correct on my recipt... poor customer service. Pizza was under cooked. Will not be using them again.."}
{"text":"If the picture doesn't speak for itself.... I always come to this location, but this time around the delivery driver couldn't find my house so the pizza got to me burned, cold, and late. Brandon gave me a comp. when I called and complained, so I thank him for that, but his computer wouldn't allow him to put my comp. in the system. I just hope when I call for my comp. I don't run into a situation where it is no where to be found on the receipt he left it on. We shall see...."}
{"text":"So had some issues off and on with this location. Now it is every time.  After the manager's lackadaisical approach to satisfying my concerns even going so far as to say \"what do you expect me to do about it\" prompted a call to the corporate 800 number which is answered by a call center. The operator took my complaint and apologized several times letting me know I would be contacted by district manager or higher. I then received an email the following day from the director of customer service accompanied by an apologize and a code for a free 5 topping pizza. Tonight we used our free pizza only to be disappointed by the order getting screwed up again. The driver forgot part of our order. After a call to the store and asking to speak with a manager, I finally just said cancel.my order and credit my credit card the amount that was charged...funny thing, same lackadaisical manager again tonight, who by the way refused to identify himself as the manager. Won't be using Papa John's again."}
{"text":"I normally order online using their phone app, as when you sign-up for rewards you get some really great deals.  I rarely pay more than $8 for a large pizza and one time I paid $11 for an XL.  They always have my pizza ready on arrival and show me the pie for handing it to me.  I normally only come here if the price is cheaper than Pizza Hut though."}
{"text":"A really good chain pizza place, mainly because of the garlic dipping sauce.  I keep on the lookout for coupons and I'm proud of my streak of never paying more than $8 for a large!  This isn't the greatest pizza place in the world, but it's perfect for a move night in at home!"}
{"text":"Love this place. Nice customer service. I ordered a pizza and was heading to pick up. My kids just fall in sleep and I asked Austin a favor and he was delivery pizza to my car!! It was a big help!!! And love their pizza!!!"}
{"text":"Bad customer service.   We were told that Papa John's policy is to not offer any of their specials to customers of not mentioned."}
{"text":"I get the level of sauce on a pizza is subjective, but I have ordered twice now with light sauce and it oozing out everywhere. I fear what they would deem to be a normal amount. But let's face it, after reading other comments about this location, they are most likely being careless in the preparation."}
{"text":"I had a craving for Papa Johns and it's been years since I've had it. They don't deliver to Ohio City, unfortunately, but it's worth the drive when you've got a hankering. Papa Johns is far from the best pizza, but it is remarkably consistent. A large Supreme was 10 bucks for take out. What a deal."}
{"text":"Decided to try a thin crust pizza from Papa Johns last night, delivery.  When it arrived, it looked like it had been made yesterday and barely warm.  The crust was so dry, I think the cardboard box would have tasted better.  Worst pizza I've had in years."}
{"text":"The Staff At This Location Are Very Nice. Pizza Is Not Good. The Sauce Is Too Sweet And The Crust Is Too Chewy. Nothing Special. They Deliver Or You Can Pick Up. Not A Dine In Spot. They Have Specials Often. I Like There Garlic Bread Sticks."}
{"text":"Very clean friendly and good food . My order is always on time and fresh . I love the rewards program and special offers ."}
{"text":"Well last week I order on line I place my order before 3 pm my pizza should be delivered around 3 :20 pm  The delivery pizza show up at 4 pm the pizza was cold I have to microwave to eat it hot call back the pizza place the will give me a credit for that well today I call and place an order again no satisfaction at all the forgot the beef I can t even see any cheese at all well no order it anything from there anymore done papajhons !!"}
{"text":"The delivery is horrible and I used the app to order for pick up and when I arrived after about 20 minutes they told me it would be at least another 30 minutes. There must have been like 12 people working in the back and only 1 person working in front. Line was out the door and no one bothered to help. Very unhappy that I had to wait over an hour for an order I place through the app. Avoid this place. If I could give it negative stars I would."}
{"text":"Have had good service from here. Ordered the brownies this time. My god are they good. Also the unseasoned wings. Good too. Like the works pizza."}
{"text":"Papa Johns always has  great discounts and deals. I just got a FREE pizza today for being a TMOBILE customer."}
{"text":"Got good pizza here a couple of times and then something happened.  Last 2 times I ordered it took forever.  80 min. today instead of the 30-40.  Even got a medium pizza instead of a large, cold and undercooked.  They said they will credit me but I am still upset about having such an awful meal."}
{"text":"This place is good last minute pizza something you can get quick but good. Also its local so its a quick and easy solution."}
{"text":"Call Papa Johns at 9:50 to use my 50 percent off promo code that expires today February 15th the customer service representative to answer the phone Nathan place my order for 2 large pizzas that was on special for $20 so my total should be $10 and he tells me then my total is $24.50 how is that when I have a 50% off promo code he told me I couldn't use both discount? He never explained I had to pay regular price in order to us the promo code just over all very poor customer service need less to say I cancelled my order and went else where."}
{"text":"I'm still a fan of this location for all my delivery needs.  However, twice now I've ordered extra cheese and received no such level of cheese.  If you are a cheese addict like me, you can share in the deep pain when you expect a fix, you pay for this fix, and....UGH, utter disappointment.  I had to write this update for my fellow cheese lovers. When I call now, I remind them that the last two pizzas were scantily clad ;)  My most recent one last night was perfecto!"}
{"text":"Typical chain pizza. Very slow and the young lady behind the register just seemed confused. Had 3 people order after me that got their orders before me. Apparently they forgot to make one of my pizzas. No apology whatsoever. Too busy rocking out to the music in the kitchen that everyone was trying to yell over to be heard."}
{"text":"Better pizza than Little Caesar's, less greasy than Pizza Hut, and about the same quality as Dominoe's pizza. It is close to my home and they throw a cute little pepper and some garlic dipping sauce in the box with the pizza. So, if we decide to go with a chain pizza place, it is frequently this Papa John's.  Parking is easy and right at the front door for pick up. We have never used the delivery service, so not sure about that. They usually get the order right if you call it in (as opposed to ordering online), but did have to call us back once because they weren't sure that the guy taking the order had written it down right (he hadn't)."}
{"text":"We order from this location online all the time. They deliver on time and are very friendly. Pizza is always good. Cheers to the staff for always delivering good pizza to a mom that hates to cook. :)"}
{"text":"I've never understood the hype about the pizza: better ingredients better pizza blah blah blah. Pizza is subpar IMO. Not bad. Just mediocre.  I ordered ahead to pick up (they don't deliver to CLEVELAND HEIGHTS, go to Guys or Little Caesars) I waited 10 minutes for someone to ask if they could help me. Even though there were about 11 guys working. It took 10 minutes! The order was wrong. Not sure how they screwed that up, although the online ordering system does not permit you to order one pizza with three customized toppings and the second pizza a different way. I ordered two simple large pizzas over the phone and they still screwed it up. After my ten minute wait the pizza was .................cold.  fail..........Fail..........FAIL! I recommend Theresa, Guys or Jets."}
{"text":"The pizza delivery drivers are reckless and irresponsible.  I do not order papa johns since I do not care for their pizza. I've called papa John's in the past with my concerns regarding the reckless speeding through my community and I'm assuming nothing was done since they still drive like idiots."}
{"text":"5/28/2018.  I bought 3xl pizza's and they came back smashed to the side....I called they told me we will send you  2 out.. I said ok  what so I do with these pizzas the girl said go ahead and keep them....I said ok.....so they called me and said we need the pizza back I said you just told me to keep it so they ate it.. .they said I figured, I'll go ahead and send him anyways. I said ok... the delivery guy comes at me all rude like where's the pizza....I said  they ate it because the girl said I could keep it and he said no I have to take the pizza back. I told him the girl just told me over the phone she was going  to send you anyways to give me the pizza.. The delivery guy rolled his eyes saying I'll call them...all rude And he drove off and now they said they ain't giving me the pizza...  RUDE COSTUMER SERVICE.... I ORDERED HERE ALL TIME TILL TODAY.....PLZ SAVE YOUR MONEY AND GO SOMEWHERE ELSE. Nice way to end this Memorial day smh"}
{"text":"Ordered online and waited the 50 minutes of the 40-50 minutes that the email said before I called. I was told my pizza was on its way and should be there in 10-15 minutes. 20 minutes later I called again to find out my pizza went out for delivery an hour earlier, had to be remade and should be to my house within 10 minutes. 15 minutes later I called to cancel the order as my doorbell rang. The freezing cold pizza that was delivered to me was sent back. I recommend you skip the pain and go to Little Caesars, I did."}
{"text":"Ordered online and picked up the pizza. Busy but was able to pick up my pizza pretty quickly. Cheese sticks are very good, pizza was ok. The green papers were pretty large chunks, not a fan. Feel like the overall quality of papa johns has gone down over the past couple years."}
{"text":"Hawaiian BBQ Chicken was 10/10 spot on guys. Keep up the good work! As far as pizza goes, this place did phenomenal for pick up/ ready to eat! They even gave us a deal of $12 for a large pizza. Cheers."}
{"text":"Worst pizza experience ever.  Called in an order at 5:00 pm for delivery at 7:00 pm. No pizza at 7:15 pm-called and they said it was on the way. Still no pizza at 8:00 pm. Drove over to the shop and told them I wanted our pizza and we weren't going to pay for a pizza ordered 3 hours ago that was an hour late. They processed our credit card refund but refused to give me the pizza. Threatened to call the police when I tried to pick up the pizza and leave -which I did after giving them my feedback on their business. Aside from the horrible customer service. Not too surprising since the company is notorious for paying employees dirt while their CEO lives in a castle in Kentucky.  Stay away for this place."}
{"text":"Lots of issues with ordering from this location tonight. Won't be ordering from here again BUT the delivery man was very kind and apologetic. I know nothing about our order issues was his fault, but he was the only one to apologize to us. That's after we called twice and spoke to two other people working there who just gave us vague run-around answers as to where our pizza was. -_-"}
{"text":"Are you kidding me? This has got to be the greatest Papa John's anywhere near me. Not going to comment on the food more than it's great for Papa John's. The service, however, is incredible. I've ordered delivery a handful of times and every time I get a great deal (without asking), they never seem rushed or in a hurry, and I always hang up thinking about the service after.  As far as delivery, I live a mile away so I've never had a problem. Tonight especially, I worked 10 hours and then drove home in the rain with horrible Phoenix drivers who don't understand how to adapt to a drizzle, and so I made the kinda crappy move of ordering pizza delivery. However, the driver was super nice, didn't mind the rain at all, and commented on how nice the weather is.  I wish I could have afforded a $100 tip to hopefully make someone's night as they made mine."}
{"text":"Thin crust like cardboard. Unable to eat. Overdone & skimpy with the toppings."}
{"text":"I haven't actually eaten my pizza yet but I'm giving this place a 1 start because it is utterly disgusting that when I pull up there are 4 employees standing directly outside the door smoking, with their apron and uniforms on. The owner of this franchise should be embarrassed....."}
{"text":"Once again, I was disappointed by the service from this place. I think from now on, I am going to just do a pick up from other locations.  The other night we ordered in pizza - 1 Lg 3 topping pizza, and had a freebie from the chain in general. The Lg, 3 topping pizza was supposed to be mushroom, pepper, and sausage (reg. sausage on 1 half and italian sausage on the other). And our free pizza was a Lg. pepperoni. Order was placed, and delivery was on time, buuuut - we got the wrong pizza.  Seriously? How can a place deliver the wrong pizza on a very casual night, when the order is placed at 5pm? Oh and to add insult to inury - they of course give us a flier with coupons on it - yeah - umm that's great you want to give customers $5 off your next order, but hello the coupon expiration date is HALLOWEEN!!! (i.e. 10/31/12) (FYI: we are in November now, not Oct.)  SO that's the experience this week from this location."}
{"text":"This review is not for the establishment, it's for the individual who represented the establishment at the time, Jose.  I've always had a wonderful experience whenever I call this place.  We've been ordering our pizza over the phone at this location for months now at least once a week.  We never spend under 30 dollars.  But today I spoke to Jose using the same phone I always use, but Jose asked me to repeat myself every 2nd word.  Now I don't mind repeating myself, it's the way he asked and his tone of voice from when he picked up to when he hung up.  He sounded like he didn't want to be there and he also didn't really care if he got my order right, which is why I asked him to repeat it.  He also sounded irritated because he couldn't hear me.  I've always had a great experience when I order here, I think some of the staff even know me by my voice an my favorite line \"extra cheese, don't be shy.\"  But Jose today was just rude and not listening to what I said at all.  I think a customer service and phone etiquette training from one of the other employees would really help out so people who are new to this establishment aren't frustrated with an employee who lacks the simple fundamentals of customer service.  Just some feedback!  Most of you guys are great :)"}
{"text":"My neighborhood fast food pizza joint - I definitely encourage all to use their online rewards program.  You will get bombarded with texts and emails but if you will get 1/2 off's, discounted pizzas, and I was able to lock up a free pizza after 2 orders.  On one occasion I selected carry out online and somehow selected BBQ sauce which i strongly advise against since it's so sweet (unless you like it).   I didn't notice until i got home but then drove back to see if they could make it.  The bbq sauce was so horrible i was willing to just pay for a new pizza.  The lady was nice enough and made a new pizza on the spot.  i tipped her a few bucks out of appreciation but i really appreciate their customer service which was more than likely my fault when ordering."}
{"text":"What the hell did I just eat. Sure wasn't papa johns... This was so grossness ! There was no garlic sauce first of all, second of all this was a thin flaky crust which it never said it would be. I ordered papa johns for the pizza I was used to and this was nasty. Advertise and deliver correctly . Wtf"}
{"text":"Picked up a extra large pepperoni and Canadian bacon.  Had it at the park 5 minutes later.  It was really awful.  Very skimpy on both toppings, could hardly see them.  $3.00 frozen Tombstone tastes better, honestly.  Maybe they do that to coupon users.  Going to Vinnys next time.  Workers were nice and helpful."}
{"text":"Sounds like this Papa Johns is under new management and is heading in a positive direction!"}
{"text":"I would not even give this store one star but this site makes me do it. We ordered pizza at 7 pm it arrived at 748pm . The driver explained he bought our pop at Fry's because the store was out. KUDOS TO HIM!!!! HOWEVER the girl Elaina, not sure if thats her name she doesnt speak clearly... took our order 4 times. And still didnt get it right. She is a liar. And I will further elaborate but I wanted to express we are surprised the driver made it. We repeated the address 5 times and the phone number 6 times. She was short with me on the phone. We expressed the only reason we order from your store is for the cheese sauce. Which should be in the notes next to my name. THIS LIAR SAID SHE EVEN WROTE IT ON THE BOX AND BLAMED HER MISTAKE ON THE DRIVER ..... THE ONLY THING ON THE BOX IS A SMILIE FACE. AND IF I COULD INSTAGRAM THAT ON THIS SITE I WOULD TO FURTHER EMBARRASSE HER AND THE STORE. The driver did his job. She failed him by not doing her job. She exercised very poor communication skills. She spoke like we were some dam kid on the phone her only response was \"I dont know; Ugh I. Just don't. Know\".... I. Know how bout you place us on hold and find out! WE know it was a waste of our time but we called back to find out where the cheese sauce was and we knew after she gave us the run around the drive would have NO CLUE we're suppose to get some. So she needs fired or retrained if you think she is worth the investment. It is now 909pm and still no cheese sauce. Thats awful!"}
{"text":"Let's face it, sometimes on a Sunday afternoon, I don't feel like going to pick up my own food. I've ordered delivery from this location 4 or 5 times and I've never been disappointed. Today was no exception. I placed my order at 11:45 and at 12:15 my pizza was already on a plate in my living room. I've had other places take over an hour for delivery so I will continue to order from these guys when I'm too hung over to get my own grub."}
{"text":"I decided last minute to grab a couple pizzas for dinner, so instead of calling them in I was already in the area so I dropped in.  I was in and out in a matter of 15 minutes with 2 hot pizzas.  While I was waiting though the staff was fun, personable and one could tell they were having fun while they worked.  Peter was a great guy to talk to.  Thanks Peter and crew!"}
{"text":"And in spite of the promises made Ali failed to credit my credit card, just as the store failed at delivering on time, a warm or even properly prepared pizza."}
{"text":"I won't be going back anytime soon.  We have ordered from Papa John's numerous times in the past and they generally do an OK job. However, my last few visits to Papa John's the customer service has been poor and the pizza has been cold,soggy, and inedible.  On this particular occasion I placed a phone order to be picked up at 4pm. I thought 50% off, can't go wrong with that. So I ordered pizza for everyone.   1 large thin crust pepperoni, sausage, and bacon.  2  medium original crust pepperoni pizzas.    I Arrived at the store at 403.  The store was empty but the empoyees were busy. I waited by the front counter even tho several employees looked at me not one acknowledged I was there for 5 minutes.  Finally,  a employee came up to the counter and assisted me.   As a I paid for my order and grabbed my pizzas I noticed that the top boxes were hot but the bottom box was cold.  I asked the cashier if the pizza was sitting out very long and she replied \" I'm not sure but I don't think so\". I opened the cold box of pizza and the pizza looked unappetizing and old.  The employee offered to make a pizza replacement.   So I was left with the decision to wait 15 minutes for one new pizza and allow the two other pizzas to get cold.  So I  made the decission and waited. Once my pizza was ready I headed home.  The large pizza was good the two pepperoni pizza were absolutely terrible.  The pizza were now cold, soggy , and once again unappetizing.  No one ate the pizza and they went straight to the trash.    There are a variety of pizza restaurants in my neighborhood and even though they do not offer 50 percent off. I still consider them a better option. I won't be going back to Papa Johns anytime soon."}
{"text":"I will give this the A-OK seal of approval purely based on their walk-in promotion of 2 pepperoni or cheese slices for $3. The slices aren't huge and the pizza is pretty run of the mill, but the $3 walk in special has saved me a couple of times in a moment of hunger."}
{"text":"What can i say, I love me some Papa John's.  I appreicate that this pizza chain is consistent, no matter what state I am in.  Prompt delivery of still hot and tasty pizza = good enough in my book.  Other reviewers rave about ordering online.  Personally, I find it much easier to pick up the phone and call vs trying to figure out how to switch out a red sauce cup for an extra cheese cup for my breadsticks...but that's just my way."}
{"text":"Zero star rating.  This place is awful. Our delivery pizza was 1.5 hour late, when it arrived it was the complete wrong order."}
{"text":"Papa johns is always a good pizza place when you want one of the pizza chains. This is probably my favorite chain pizza place. It also isn't overpriced and the delivery is pretty reliable from my experience. I'll be ordering again on the Netflix and chill nights."}
{"text":"most terrible service i have experienced from any kind of establishment. paul the manager was very rude. initially i was supposed to wait for an order that was supposed to take most 50 minutes. i did not get it until 2 hours and 30 minutes. when i called for a refund he was unwilling to giv"}
{"text":"Boo. I picked up my pepperoni pizza and this Papa John's was out of Parmesan cheese. How can you be out of Parmesan cheese on a Wednesday evening? The pizza was OK, nothing to write home about."}
{"text":"As for the service itself, I usually order take out and never had a problem with them but it's their pizza that I have a problem with. I don't know what they do differently but for whatever reason, their pizzas are super oily. Just oily and soggy to the point where you cant even pick up a slice without everything just falling off and you being left with just a piece of soggy crust. Even though I'm lactose intolerant, I can eat a few slices of pretty much any other pizza without suffering any consequences but if I eat just two slices of Papa John's, I'll be bedridden for the next 12 hours. Within' this block, there's literally 5 other places to get pizza and this is definitely on the bottom of my list."}
{"text":"Do not order from this location on Christmas. It looks like the driver sat on the pizza before delivering to us. What a shame. I even gave a 30% tip up front."}
{"text":"They must have improved this location. I pre-ordered online and they delivered at the exact time they said they would. My delivery girl had a red face from walking around in the cold to find my apartment, still she kept friendly."}
{"text":"I love these guys!  When I moved to my new neighborhood, the nearest Dominos location (my usual go-to company for delivery pizza) was having troubles with their connectivity to the online ordering system, and I HATE ordering by phone, because I prefer to look over the 'coupons' and order something that way, rather than spending $20 or so per pizza. So, I was looking for a substitute, and after being thoroughly disappointed with Pizza 73, I decided to give these guys a shot.  Their prices were about comparable with the other big chains, for pizza that is MUCH better than 73 (I'm torn whether I like theirs or Domino's better). What really sold me though was the service. The online system estimated 45-50 minutes which seemed like a lot for me (in my old neighborhood it was usually more like 25-30), but was the same as any of the other places... however, my delivery guy was there 20 minutes earlier than projected, and still APOLOGIZED for taking so long, and came equipped with paper plates, napkins, and a free fridge magnet (none of which I've ever seen from anywhere else) in addition to the customary menu/coupon card. He also asked if I'd ordered from them before (I think they must have some kind of record of new customers) and when I mentioned I hadn't, he gave me an extra little business card good for a free side dish with my next order. Every single time I've ordered from them I've had a friendly, smiling delivery guy (who could actually speak english, which is a big plus in my books!), always gotten the plates, napkins and magnets (even though I now have far more of the latter than I'd ever need) and have never ONCE had any issues with my order.  All in all, I flip between these guys and Dominos when I order now, but if you haven't tried these guys out, I would definitely suggest it. This location especially is run great and has never let me down."}
{"text":"I ordered a pizza at 10:25, just one pepperoni pizza, nothing fancy, and I did not get the pizza until 11:50. They sent me an email confirmation saying it would be 30-40 minutes, which obviously wasn't the case. When I called to inquire after an hour they simply said it was on it's way, no offer for a coupon or a comp pizza or anything. After taking one bite I'm less than satisfied. It's cold and completely unimpressive. To top it off when I had to sign my credit card receipt the delivery person asked me if thy could have my pen bc they left there's at home. I will never order from them again. There are far too many BETTER pizza places to indulge in."}
{"text":"They screwed my delivery order about a week ago acting manager at the time promised a free medium next order as long as we gave our phone number. Today placed an order with John, (acting manager today) along with trying to get the pizza promised. Now all of sudden there is no info on the free pizza promised because of they're error from previous visit. They just lost a lifelong customer. Moral of the story if they promise something make them honor it cause there's no way to tell if there are just telling you that, to satisfy you for the moment. I was told owners name is Keva and there's no corporate to complain to no contact number for them either."}
{"text":"Very convenient location, seems pretty slow which is good because we've been there three times and our order has always been hot & ready.   Downside: very limited parking in the back and pickup is in the front thru a small window. No waiting benches or anything. Think Pete's Fish & Chip building, just a lot smaller. Either way, worth it for now."}
{"text":"I really don't eat papa johns all like that but I had a cool deal from my bank to get some cash back on my purchase so that's how I ended up here. The online ordering is pretty efficient and the time that they disclosed my order would be ready it was actually ready! I was impressed because sometimes even with other pizza places never have it ready! I might be a fan now since they have a rewards program of some sort. Super cool!"}
{"text":"Employees were very friendly. Service was good and fast. I came in to order and left with my pizza. I was really surprised with how clean their kitchen was. Fun to watch them make my food. Overall, good experience."}
{"text":"Used it a few times, the pizza seemed to get worse each time. Tried another place close by an have settled on it as a better option, Papa John better get 'his' act together as the product is not conducive for a repeat performance. Really disappointed in the product. Ted S"}
{"text":"Please stay AWAY from this location!!! I love Papa Johns so much I keep coming back, but it never fails I get the worse customer service. If I could give it NO STARS I would considering 2/3 of the times I order pizza I NEVER receive it whether it's ordered online or over the phone. Then when I call them back they act like I never placed an order."}
{"text":"Papa John's was a rolling stone They have a franchise right near your home And when I've tried it All it's left me was with stomach pains  A different location in Cleveland made me and my friends sick as dogs for days a few years back. At least this pizza didn't do that. One of my sexy female friends (married) lives in Willoughby, and we ordered from here because it's what her kids like (and one of them is obsessed with Peyton Manning, isn't he like 67 now?).  The pizza is as bland and awful as always. It's not delivery, it's DiGiorno's. Well this is almost as bad as a DiGiorno's. Maybe as bad. Maybe worse. Especially because they order that Hawaiian sh** and who even does that. But the delivery was prompt and it made the kids very happy so there's that."}
{"text":"Just ordered and holy smokes I've never seen the delivery time like this one, 65 to 75 minutes. wow they need to step their game because this is becoming not worth the wait at all not to mention it's a hit or miss if the pizzas cooked good or not disappointed"}
{"text":"Their online ordering system is extremely frustrating when using your mobile device, however, if you use a PC or desktop it becomes much easier to use.  Got a really good deal from here being order a large pizza and get a medium 12 inch for free so where it was regularly $50 it was just $20.  Papa John's pizza is also my favourite because it is so delicious."}
{"text":"I was skeptical to order at due to the other reviews. I was impressed with the delivery speed and accuracy. The driver was very friendly. The pizza was very hot and tasty. Overall, a very good experience. I will definitely be ordering from this papa johns again. Maybe they are turning things around?"}
{"text":"The person answering the phone was great, friendly , knew her stuff! I placed the order which  was around $30. I informed her that I was paying in cash and with a 100 dollar bill. At this point I was placed on hold and then instructed that unless I was paying by card my order was not honored. I did not have a credit card on me and she said she would see what she could do. \" Manager says credit only, will not except $100 bill.\"  \"sorry, it is his call, not mine. He makes the rules\" FINE, my new rule is to order from DOMINO'S . PAPA JOHNS JUST LOST A CUSTOMER FOR LIFE. BTW, I am in the food and beverage industry. I always find a way to keep customers happy. PAPA it was a good run, will not see you again!"}
{"text":"I enjoy this location.  They are super busy, but always make great pizzas and they are friendly with great customer service.  I like the thin crust all veggie pizza with chicken and jalapenos. It rewards itself when being a member and ordering online to obtain membership points. Once you reach 25 points, you get a free one topping large pizza. Pretty good when you obtain the points quickly since you get several points at a time per order. :)   Awesome thin crust they have!"}
{"text":"It is rare for me to pen a bad review on any restaurant, however this one needs to know how horrible their service is.    After ordering online, I decided to pick up (or carry out) the pizza since I was relatively close by.    When I entered the store I was immediately greeted by the staff member behind the cash register.  He asked if I was \"carrying out\" an order and I said \"yes\" and gave him my name.  He looked puzzled while scanning the screen and asked my name a second time. Again i gave him my name to which he responded with somebody else's name.  I said no and a third time gave him my name.  He then said \"ohhhhh, there you are man....sorry.\"  He told me the price and I gave him cash.  He then gave me the change and closed the cash register. At the same time, another customer entered the store behind me.  The staff member immediately greeted the second customer and asked for his name to look up an an order. I interrupted him and said \"may I have my pizza now please?\"  And he said \"in a second, I want to help this customer first.\" Puzzled, I said, \"excuse me? I just paid you and my pizza is behind you on the rack.\" And he said, \"yes, but let me take this guy's order first...\"  I stopped him short and said, \"wouldn't it be best to complete service with the first customer (me) before you begin on a second customer?\"  He responded, \"um, oh yea man....I see.  Here's your pizza.\"  I took the pizza from his hands and looked at the second customer behind me who shrugged his shoulders as I walked out the door.  To top everything off, the box was cold and so was the pizza inside.  This bad personal customer experience now tells me I will never order from here again.  Sad, and I really liked their pizza...when it's warm at least."}
{"text":"This is truly a delivery nightmare. Possibly pick up is okay but delivery is a continuing disaster.  When my pizza had not arrived 30 minutes after the latest stated delivery time I called and got Karen. She argued with me and said delivery time doesn't account for stop signs. I said I am only 2.5 miles away. I said I wanted to cancel and she told me I couldn't because it was out for delivery. I wanted to speak to the manager and was told that she was the manager.  I cancelled the order and placed another order for pickup from the Papa John's on Boulder Hwy and picked up an excellent pizza."}
{"text":"terrible consistency in product quality & terrible service overall. with such a big name in the industry for pizza, you would think papa john's cares more about their image? this location does not because they take zero pride in product quality and customer service.   every time we pick up pizza or have our pizza delivered from this location, the upcharges we pay for extra cheese or additional ingredients are always missing after. we pay for all these additions and tip, but the service is consistently terrible. this will be the last time i go to papa john's after giving it 3 attempts to get it right.   there has been zero compensatory actions to make us feel better about the terrible product quality and honestly, the only upside of this location is that they are right around the corner from home. avoid this place if you want a quality pizza and good service for your buck.   the delivery service needs to change and the management needs to show more concern in the future for lacking customer service overall."}
{"text":"Always fast and easy online ordering and even quicker staff. Good dependable pizza!"}
{"text":"It is what it is. It is a chain pizza shop. That being said I have never had an issue with this store. Always has deals online and a rewards program so easy to get free pizza. I order online and it always ready when they said it is ready. The pizza is always delicious. The manager is personable. I have been a regular customer for about 3 years  (1 to 2 times a month) and she recognizes me when I walk in. No complaints here!"}
{"text":"They charge too much. Plus ordered a large and when I got it home looked like a small. To bad they closed NYPD off Union Hills."}
{"text":"An ok Pizza place that tends to be a little expensive considering the quality. But the upside of Papa Johns Pizza is that you know exactly what you are getting."}
{"text":"Horrible costumer service.  The manager Tamera was extremely rude to me. Never ordering from this pizza place again."}
{"text":"The pizza was cold when it arrived and the dough was undercooked.  The wings were not good."}
{"text":"I've kind of always been a Papa John's. As far as the bigger chain style pizza places, they've always been the best, in my opinion. I've been vegan for several years now so my ordering habits have obviously changed quite a bit. Turns out many places use whey, milk, or butter on their crusts and/or in their sauce. Thankfully, Papa John's does not! I like ordering the Garden Fresh pizza with no cheese. It's fully vegan and totally delicious. I've even got several people from my work ordering the same thing these days - and they are not vegan, or even vegetarian. It's just a darn good pizza!   This review is actually less about the pizza though and more about my last experience with PJ's... particularly in comparison to my experience with NYPD Pizza. A while back I tried venturing off from my usual ordering and trying NYPD. I was excited to learn that they actually do a fully vegan pizza, complete with vegan cheese. That's great, but I'm not actually a fan of vegan cheese, so I went cheese-less anyways. I ordered 2 pizzas with some veggies on them. The total came out to nearly $50... for some bread with veggies and sauce. Well, after 90 min and the order wasn't here, I called to just cancel. While I was on the phone, the driver actually showed up... so I decided to just take the pizza. I paid, including tip, and went inside. Both pizzas were cold... not the biggest problem... one of them, my wife's, was loaded with jalapeno peppers instead of green peppers and she's hyper sensitive to spice and could not eat it. I called the store to let them know and the manager was apathetic at best and just said they would make another pizza and send it out, but it would be about 30min +.... fine.  Eventally, almost 2.5 hours after ordering, we were able to eat our cold pizzas. No comps from the store or anything. I left a review on Yelp and they finally decided to reach out and offer a gift certificate to come back and try it again. They specifically said that their pizza doesn't do well in delivery and recommended coming into the store to try it. Why can it not transport? Papa John's has no trouble transporting hot pizza?!  Which brings me back to my love for Papa John's. About a week ago I ordered my usual Garden Fresh with no cheese. My delivery time in email was 30-40 min as usual. After about 50 min with no pizza, I gave the store a call to see what was up. It wasn't a huge deal, but my wife and I had an appointment coming up and wanted to eat quick before we headed out. The manager let me know that they were down 1 driver and just running a little behind. That was no big deal and I understood. The driver showed up within 5 min anyways. Pizza was still hot and delicious as always.   Then I get a coupon in the mail this week for a free medium pizza because the order was a late. I didn't have to complain. It wasn't even an issue for me. But they just went above and beyond to make sure that their customer was taken care of. This is why I come back. Thanks Papa John's! My apologies for thinking I could try something else and be happy. Keep up the good work."}
{"text":"Great pizza and specials. Love the fact that they deliver late. Last time I ordered the driver was pretty lazy and made me meet him in the parking lot of my condo complex. I order delivery so i DON'T have to leave my condo... Sigh... Other than that the food is pretty good."}
{"text":"I love papa johns BUT apparently this location being a tad shady isn't for me. As I sat there, innocently grabbing my little one a small pizza...a little weed deal transpired right in front of me. Man from the \"street\" walked in, signaled a papa johns employee...then out front they went - cloud of weed smoke left behind. For those of us still believing in a life without drugs...it wasn't a selling point for papa johns. Pizza smells good and the woman working my order was pleasant."}
{"text":"A friend of mine was stranded because of the CLT airport fire, and while this location had on the web that they stopped delivering at 11 PM (and a nearby Pizza Hut refused to provide service, though they were listed as delivering until midnight), they said they could do it, took the order, let me pay for it (so my friend wouldn't have to), and were very accommodating. We'll see if the order comes through, but I can't fault the customer service! UPDATE: The order arrived promptly and was hot. Excellent work, PJ!"}
{"text":"I reecently went here about 1 month ago. The thing is my pizza was cold. I just put it in the oven and said I will let that one pass. Today comeback the pizza is totally wrong Again. I think this will be the last time I go to this location. The pizza was hot but wrong toppings and half cook"}
{"text":"Okay, I love Papa John's pizzas, but this location can't seem to get it right. I live about 1/2 mile from the business. I've ordered from them, via phone and online, several times over the past 6 years or so, but they always seem to forget something or to be late.  A month or so ago, the order took over an hour for no apparent reason, then showed up with a charge twice what was listed online. Last week, they decided to omit the extra sauces I asked for, but add (and charge for) anchovies, which I really don't care for. A couple of hours ago, I placed an order for three pizzas (two on special and one free!), waited an hour and a half, and, after calling, was told by the manager that the driver had tried calling a number I had had 12 years and dozens of orders ago, got no answer, and had left. He refunded one pizza off - *the free one*. When she showed up again, 45 minutes later and with the same pizzas minus one (apparently refunding a pizza equals deleting it from the order but still deducting the \"Papa Rewards\" thingy), they were barely warm. So I ended up paying full price for three hot pizzas and getting two lukewarm ones - waaay late . $21.75 apiece. My friends: hungry. Me: upset and probably not going to order from the convenient pizza place again."}
{"text":"This place suck I order my pizza around 2 and at 4 my pizza still isn't here yet seem like they have no driver"}
{"text":"The people working at this store are thieves. Everyone who has ever eaten a Papa Johns Pizza knows there is one Garlic sauce already in the box with the pizza. I like extra and so when I went there to pick up my pizza, I paid for the extra garlic sauce and when she did not give me what i had paid for, I was told is it not in the box ???  I mean are you charging me for something that is already in the box anyways.. or how else do  ypu think there are two Garlic sauces in the box  which is clearly not the norm and I did not order with the pizza..  Absolutely Pathetic service and Pizza was bland and this store skimps on the toppings big time."}
{"text":"Yesterday my sister placed an order to be delivered and we were waiting for over a hour and half for it. We started to wonder why it was taking so long so we went to check the time on the email reciept and she noticed that it was made for carryout and not delivery. We called the store to let them know of the mistake and without even asking, they offered to scratch the previous order and make a fresh batch of pizzas. At first when we found out of OUR error, we were going to be bummed our food was going to be cold. But they were very kind to give us a fresh hot order and they delivered it to us very quickly. They deserve a review of the great customer service they gave us, when it was our mistake."}
{"text":"They did great.  Ordered a large pie, two topping special.  Asked if I needed plates or napkins.  Delivered outside my inn.   Ordered at 5:30, received before 6:00.  Driver apologized for the wait.  Pie was PaPa standard.  Fine execution front to back."}
{"text":"Good pizza,  they've never got my order wrong. Sometimes arrives so hot the cheese is still stringy other times arrives a bit cold. Delivery are courteous.  I only order online so I can't speak to how the people who take orders are."}
{"text":"Management here is a joke. Straight up lied to me when I called asking where my order was. When pizza finally showed up it was room temperature - cheese all congealed and wings cold. Please go somewhere else. In general I love Papa John's but this location sucks."}
{"text":"We ordered a pizza at 12:15pm on Sunday 6/19. We got a call from the driver a12:58pm asking where we lived as he couldn't find us. We gave directions but his phone died or he cut us off. We called back at 1:15 and then re-ordered at 1:28pm. At 2:30pm we called back and was told they hadn't even made our pizza as they were waiting for another driver. This is totally unacceptable. Customer service is less than poor and we've ended up having to go to another pizza provider."}
{"text":"This location SUCKS!!!!!    Every time i order from here they Are slow, and rude.   Don't even try going in the store, they have 10 employees standing around, 1 on the phone and no one at the register.   If I could give them a 0, I would.   The only reason I order here is because they are convenient for my house, but yet every time, I am frustrated.  This is one of the easiest things ever, pizza.  Seriously mr manager, are you that poor at managing your employees?????   Last time I was there, the manager was standing there, while all the employees were standing around.   I literally had 6 different employees walk past me and not one asked if I needed help.  I was the first one in line and stood there for 10 Minutes before anyone even acknowledged me to ask about my order.  Then they found that someone processed my order wrong in their system and they had to ring it up again, and to top it off, they had only one register open, so they couldn't ring me up till they struggled thru placing a phone order.    The. There is the phone...while in there I kept hearing them tell the person on the phone that they can't hear them, and it wasn't even loud in the room.   So then my next time, I had to call them and they too told me over and over that they can't hear me.   Seriously... Get a phone that works, get an amplifier if you need to.  Your business depends only it.   Guaranteed, if you fixed this, you would make that money back in less than 1 week by saving the time you would have normally been asking clients to Repeat themselves.   Papa johns corporate, you should be ashamed of this location."}
{"text":"Anytime I have ordered from this location there is always an issue. Forgotten items or they are out of the item and only inform me upon delivering, after they have processed the charge on my card. Upon receiving my incomplete order today, John the delivery driver attempted to resolve the issue with his manager Dana who did not have the knowledge on how to fix the issue and wanted to press giving me a credit. Not wanting a credit as I will never be ordering from this store again, Dana asked if I would repeat my credit card number over the phone and I stated no. I ended up cancelling my order and went else where."}
{"text":"I've ordered from this location twice before and each time there was an issue. Tonight, I made an attempt to make a delivery order and I will no longer be ordering from this location again. Woman on the phone didn't seem like she knew what she was doing, which was confirmed when another gentleman came on the phone and said, \"I'm sorry your order is being taken from someone new,\" which was fine, I get it. But the gentleman who proceeded to go over my order was very rude. I work in customer service and would not speak to a guest the way he did. I love Papa John's, but this location could use some better customer service."}
{"text":"Order 2 pizzas on a Friday for pickup one was made correctly the second one which I ordered was suppose to be the works end up being chicken & veggies. Called & spoke to someone who stated they would do a replacement with the right one, well when I called to order replacement I spoke to a girl who \"didn't\" see order,asked to speak with manager & she just changed her voice (craziness)...called back & asked to speak with a manager & he got it fixed & funny he found order smh..I'll stick to Barros"}
{"text":"Best tasting chain pizza, by far.  Love the garlic sauce for crust dipping.  But price is high..... and don't try to use their current online specials, none of them work.  After ordering from them, I got a $5 off coupon in the mail, for my local store.  Perfect! Unfortunately, the online Papa John's Pizza site, AND the PJ local store would NOT take the coupon they sent me.  The local store on Cimmeron had me call corporate.  Corporate could do nothing, but record a complaint.  Told me I'd hear back in 2-3 day.... Right!!! Two weeks later, and nada.  I ended up ordering from Pizza Hut and got a great price on an advertised special, that they honored!  And it was decent pizza.  Too bad Papa John's has to come with a time consuming hassle, and a refusal to honor advertised offers.  Papa John's Pizza, I won't order from you again... on principle.   If I'm going to pay full price, I'll order from a local Italian pizzeria with AMAZING taste.  Not paying those prices for chain pizza.  Ya'll are too big for your chain pizza britches!  And it's especially disappointing that you post and send out awesome deals.... but WON'T honor them.  Not very honest."}
{"text":"Ok so I always like to give second chances but 3rd time you mess up Im kinda over it. I have had plenty of problems with this location, from messing up my order to over charging me to delivery problems. I had a driver say he couldn't come up to the 3rd floor to bring me my pizza that I had to go down to him and get it, if thats the case I should have just picked up the order myself. Then another one had nerve to forget my drinks and wanted to still charge me for them and expected a tip. Obviously customer service is not their priority!"}
{"text":"I'll never order from Papa Johns again. I placed an order online for 8 pizzas a day in advance. Originally I scheduled the order for 6:45 but realized that that was the dinner rush and the likelihood of my pies being ready in time was slim so I called in to move it to 8:30 to make it easier and more likely to be ready as this was a time sensitive event. I go and pick up the pizza at 8:15 and I'm assuming this person who was the manager looks at me dumbfounded and states that the pizza was just delivered.   I inform her that it was a carry out order. She just stares at me so I ask again...\"Soooo,  are we going to call them back..because it was for carry out?\" She then starts to blame me saying \"Well you put it in as delivery..\" I proceed to show her the confirmation for carry out then she shifts the blame from me to \"the internet company who puts in the orders\" all the while taking no ownership of the fact that it is now 8:30 pm and I still have no pizzas. Nice.  The delivery driver finally gets back and I'm beyond irritated but I just want to get out of this joke of a place. The manager takes even longer to ring me up because she initially tried to charge me a delivery fee for the pizza   Again, I was PICKING UP.  I was so annoyed I didn't even bother checking if they got the toppings right and  When all is said and done, I'm leaving with a bad taste on my mouth, 8 nukewarm pizzas pulled from the delivery drivers bag, and I'm now 30 mins late to my own party. This was way unacceptable and the lack of ownership in this place was sickening. I'll stick with Pizza Hut."}
{"text":"The product here is pretty standard, the one and major draw back here is....... the service!!!!! This is officially the last time I come here due to the fact 90% time you place an order it takes 45min or more to get ready. Even on non game day times. Then on the 10% where they actually complete the order in a reasonable time when you get your pizza home it's already cold bc they made the order in 4 minutes lol. Not a good medium here for getting a standard franchise pie. Also they don't deliver to my corner of seven hills which is literally 4 minutes from the store. Sigh... I'm sure it's foe the best anyway. Just foe the love of God owners and managers. Get your crew together!!!!"}
{"text":"I just called to place an order and got the best customer service. Such friendly employees! And it's 10pm on a Friday, that says a lot about what type of employees they are hiring!"}
{"text":"Don't go here!!! They rip you off by not giving you the extra sauces you Pay for and then refuse to refund the money. The pizza is also not very good."}
{"text":"I have always been a fan of Papa John's Pizza, especially more than the other large pizza delivery chains. The quality of the pizza and prices were good and found it hard to complain. My opinion has started to change and I can say for a fact that I will never order pizza from the Papa John's at 231 W Thomas Rd, Phoenix, AZ 85013.  I generally order a thin crust pizza and more often than not and like today, the pizza comes cold and has the consistency of wet cardboard and what you would assume would be crispy is about as far from it as you can get. The past few orders have been messed up in one way or another. I've received plain wings instead of the flavor I ordered and I can't count the amount of times the driver has forgot and promised to bring back a 2 liter of soda but never come back to bring it.  There are too many great pizza places around me to bother ordering this consistently bad pizza, even for convince sake and I would suggest you do the same."}
{"text":"I'm staying at a hotel in Vegas that had a flyer in the room with a pizza special from this Papa John's so i called. I asked about the special and Guadalupe told me I had to order online to get it. Pretty bad customer service as I had her on the phone and it would have been easier just to order from her but whatever. I order online and after an hour I call to fine out what happened to my pizza. Guadalupe smugly says, \"I'm waiting for the delivery guy to come back to give him your order.\" So, I asked, \"What does that mean?\" and she unapologetically said, \"Probably another half an hour\". I told her that an hour and a half was a long time for 1 pizza and she was like, \"yup\". Guadalupe is in the WRONG business and should not be dealing with the public."}
{"text":"I'm pretty easy to please when it comes to home delivery, fast food pizza. As long as it's cheesy and bready I am usually OK. We discovered last night that Papa John's actually delivered to our place, even though they are over on Ft Apache, so I thought we would give them a try.  I should point out here that up until last night I had never sampled a Papa John's pizza, however I have often heard them compared favourably to Pizza Hut or Dominoes.  I ordered a Ham and Pineapple pizza and a serve of wings with ranch dip and garlic dip. The pizza arrived more promptly than the 65 minute estimate and the driver was friendly enough.  When I opened my pizza box I was greeted with the sight of something that looked like it had come straight out from under a heat lamp at a food court. Upon eating a slice it turned out to be fresher than it looked, but it was a bit greasy and the sauce was overly sweet and unusual on a pizza outside of the frozen section at a supermarket. The pineapple on my pizza really didn't work well with the already very sweet sauce. I ate a couple of slices and consigned the rest to the fridge for more desperate times. I found myself eating for the sake of eating.  Next I moved on to my wings. I think they were honey chipotle or something very similar. They tasted pretty decent but were extremely gloopy and difficult to eat. They could have done with about 70% less sauce. The garlic dip in particular was a bizarre concoction. It looked like clear, melted butter and tasted weird. Probably not meant for wings, but I'm not sure what it would go with.  Sadly, I think Papa John's is going to have to be given the big miss in future. Of the low-end pizza chains I would have to say that it is easily my least favourite."}
{"text":"Way to step up your game! I got two desserts both of them were hot, fresh and delicious! Delivery time was quick and they were good  from the first bite tothe last bite! I mistakenly left your good review at another Papa Johns location. Delicious,  soft, gooey hot cinna- pie and chocolate chip pie! DELICIOUS!"}
{"text":"Way to step up guys !quick delivery and the food is awesome and fresh! This bread is so soft and so warm and so covered with icing I just can't believe it"}
{"text":"Ordered my pizza online at 10:33pm for a maximum delivery at 11:23pm. At 11:16 I get a phone call from the shop telling me that my pizza is undeliverable due to the block's electricity shutting down. I understand things happen out of our control such as this case, but when I told him I placed my order at 10:33, he said that my pizza was \"literally half way done in the oven\". It takes 7-10 minutes to cook a pizza. Why did mine go in the oven 30 minutes after my order, 8mins before my max delivery time?!   He told me his GM was calling on the other line and he would give me a call right back to see what he's able to do with my order. It's now 11:50, I'm very hungry, and everything is closing. Still waiting for my phone call which I know I will not be receiving!!"}
{"text":"Ordered 8 pizzas for my son's party at LaserQuest.  They work with Papa John's so it was very easy.  However, one of our pizzas had a long strand of hair embedded in the cheese.  When I talked to the Papa John's they apologized and said they would apply credit to the Papa John's by my house.    I just called and before I ordered I verified whether they had my credit.  The lady said no and transferred me to the manager.    The manager could've nicely said that the other restaurant wasn't authorized to give me a credit but he was a total a$$hole.    Sorry Papa John!!!  Plenty of pizza joints within a one-mile radius of me."}
{"text":"On 05/26/2018 at about 7:45pm, I placed an order for delivery. I ordered a large Works pizza and a medium pepperoni. The Works pizza looked great, the pepperoni pizza looked rather questionable and not appetizing. The top of the crust was partially sliced but not the pizza. As I cut into it to make slices I noticed...the sauce didn't look right and the cheese looked disturbing. So, I called in and told the manager. I told him I wanted to be refunded for the pepperoni pizza. He told me I had to bring it in so he can see it in order to refund me. I asked if he could send the delivery guy back to pick it up and he said \"once the pizza is in someone's house they can't pick it up.\" I told him if I had to bring the pizza back I wanted to be refunded back for my delivery charge and tip I paid the driver. He said \"Okay.\" Less than 10 minutes later he called me back and said I had to bring back both pizzas for a refund. I asked why did I have to bring in both if I wanted to keep one of them. He said \"You have to bring them both in for a refund.\" I again reiterated that I wanted to keep the one pizza and only had concerns about the one. He once again said\"You have to bring them both in for a refund.\" I did share a few choice words with him out of frustration and knowing he was only trying to make things complicated for me. I called back and asked for his name and I then asked for his boss name. I advised I would be contacting her and the BBB and whomever else to report this issue. So, I drove up there with both pizza's and he credited my account and said it should fall back onto my account after a couple of days. Now he did NOT open up the pizza boxes when I was inside of the store after he told me over the phone he needed to see the pizza. Once, I got into my vehicle I noticed he opened up a pizza box.  At this point I'm pulling out of the parking lot of Papa Johns.  That manager needs training in management, critical thinking, and customer service skills. There was no reason for me to return a pizza I wanted to keep. All he had to do was refund me for the original order once I made it to the store with the pizza I wanted to return and charge me for the one I wanted to keep.  He went out of his way to inconvenience me and I hope he doesn't do this to another customer.  At this point I don't plan on ever ordering from Papa Johns.  Also, the delivery guy banged on my door like a maniac as soon as he stepped on my porch. I was sitting right by the door and opened it immediately and told him that the door bell works. This location is in dire need of better training."}
{"text":"Pizza delivery was very fast. I ordered online, sat down for 10 minutes or so and there it was. Good quality pizza with crushed red peppers in the box.  Highly recommend for delivery."}
{"text":"If there is a no star option, I would give it a NO Star!  So I have ordered twice at this place from to be delivered at my job so, we can enjoy Papa John's. At first I thought the pricing was a little bit much with a 30% Off Large Specialty Pizza. I get there is a delivery charge and paid almost $25 with tips included.  I called to ask for a prize and it was way less than the one I ordered that had supposedly the 30% Off.  I spoke to the \"General Manager, Tim\" and asked why would they send fliers of discounts if there are really no discount.  I wanted to speak to someone who is in charge of this location and he said that they are in the east coast. I ask if there is someone who is in charge in their region and said no one is in charge of their region...BOLOGNA! Needless to say, I am never ordering here ever AGAIN or possibly not even eat Papa Johns EVER as well!"}
{"text":"Screwed us over once again! Almost no toppings and when I commented the guy making the pies just grunted. Better ingredients is great but you can't count on them letting you taste an ingredient.  Glad there is a round table"}
{"text":"I use to always like papa johns...however, this location has made me think otherwise. Poor quality and the new deep dish is not even close to as advertised. Poor make quality and for paying extra for it, would've been way better off going elsewhere...will not be back"}
{"text":"The pizzas are good, but ordering sides usually takes a phone call and a long wait while they send another driver with whatever they forgot."}
{"text":"Took my in laws' kids there. Food was great. Pizza came faster thank i thought. Great spirits w staff. They were very kid friendly and tried helping with paper napkins and accommodated all the way. The helped with kids pictures as well as made sure to bring the kids moods up by being funny and goofy. Great for birthdays. The children loved it and a few days later they were asking to see if we could celebrate the next Birthday there. As an uncle w no kids i can tell this place caters to kids the right way."}
{"text":"This location is the worst ever!!! I ordered a large 3 topping pizza with extra cheese as one of the toppings and when I got to the store to pick it up the cheese didn't even cover the dough in the center of the pizza, how is that extra cheese.  I asked them to add more cheese so they remade the whole pizza and again I could see dough in the center of the pizza.  I sooooo would not recommend this location. A few days prior I ordered from the one on Sunset and Pecos and my pizza was ooozing with cheese at least a 1/2\" thick so obviously I expected consistency as this is a chain.  The employees at the Nellis location barely spoke English and are definitely not about good customer service or customer satisfaction, I will never go back there again."}
{"text":"I have to leave a review for this location because of Anthony, the general manager. I had a company meeting and at the last minute, everyone wanted pizza. I called and spoke to him about all the things I can and can't have on the pizza, plus not being able to make up my mind on whether we should have regular soda or diet soda. Anyway, he sat on the phone patiently and took the order... which felt like a full 30 minutes of me debating with myself.  THEN, I call him back frantic because I didn't have cups for the meeting... and he went to the Walgreens next door and picked me up a bag of cups (at no extra charge). I couldn't believe he went above and beyond that way. The pizza got there at the scheduled time I asked for, along with my cups, and everyone loved their pizza.   We'll be ordering from this location a lot now... thank you Anthony!"}
{"text":"I always order from here but the last couple of times the pizza and wings have been horrible. Looked like someone threw cheese on raw veggies and sent it out for delivery."}
{"text":"Wonderful pizza!!!! Fast delivery time. Extra cheesy and really good!!!! Will definetly order from here again..."}
{"text":"I've eaten food from this Papa John's twice now and both experiences have been incredibly amazing. First time I have a cheese pizza and some breadsticks and both were cooked to perfection. They were still nice and warm when I ate them back home.   Second time was at the store and I was not disappointed with the food. The environment of the store is quite nice and calm. There's a Tv in the background that goes on and there's also a nearby bathroom which is very convenient. The pizza tasted amazing and it was nice and soft. It wasn't burning hot; it had a pleasing warmth to it that didn't make me burn my tongue. Their cheese sticks honestly looked like a mini cheese pizza cut into sticks, but without the sauce. Regardless, it tasted amazing. Their chocolate brownie was very soft and nice, though it was personally too rich for me (I don't have much of a sweet tooth but my boyfriend loved it!).   I look forward to coming here some more in the future."}
{"text":"Won't go here ever again. Was there waiting for an online order and was watching an employee who was making a pizza wipe his noise and face and keep working. That's disgusting"}
{"text":"I have ordered pizza delivery from here several times and have gotten great pizza and great service. My only concern is they are a bit pricy but then, the reason I use them instead of other pizza places is the quality. I guess you get what you pay for and if we are going to splurge on \"junk food\" we want high quality ingredients!"}
{"text":"It's Papa Johns... standard as you can get.  Delivery is fast, people are friendly, food is hot. That's all that matters, right?"}
{"text":"I would love to know what my $35 order of pizza tasted like but the driver was rude about the fact that he didn't have enough change. He spent 15 minutes arguing with me to discuss what policy was on the bill that I had instead of calling back to papa johns like I asked him at least 4 times, then he asked for the pizza back without handing me my money."}
{"text":"Pizza never came, even after I called twice and they said it was on it's way.  Never came, as in, never, and never was told that it would not be coming, so literally waited hours for it.  I also waited in the lobby for over a half hour during the deliver window to make the delivery driver's life easier and was frustrated to say the least.  We ordered for 15 people and needless to say it was pretty annoying that the pizza never came and they lied twice about it being on it's way.  Please do not place an order from this terrible establishment."}
{"text":"Coupon over the phone! Order \"well done\" so that crust is not too doughy. Friendly service -- I can hear their smiles over the phone. Went to pick up pizza since I didn't know where the heck I was-- that's vegas for you... Messes with your memory... And the Cashier person showed me my order- opened each box to make sure! Love that! The friendly who took my order also said hello again! All smiles and bubbles! Will order again I'm sure! In plaza next to Denny's."}
{"text":"I ordered an extra-large pepperoni pizza for delivery for lunch today. They took quite a long time to deliver, but the pizza being practically cold, is not my biggest gripe.   The pizza literally had NO CHEESE!!! I seriously couldn't even believe it. How can a worker forget to put cheese on a pizza??? It was pepperoni on top of bread because, oh, it barely had sauce either.   This clearly shows the type of employees this location has working for them. Employees that couldn't care less about their jobs, much less about their customers. It is seriously a sad state. Plus, with delivery, I paid $23 for this garbage.   Papa John's was one of the better pizza places, at least it used to be. This experience shows how low they've dropped the bar."}
{"text":"Would give no stars, because I just got sick eating this pizza the other day.  I ordered a large 5 topping pizza and found every topping was scattered incorrect and the bacon was burnt to a crisp and I picked out some fat pieces of bacon as well. Not good.  Later I just felt sick to my stomach and ran into the restroom.   Could it just been me, or was it eating one disgusting pizza which left a bad taste in my mouth? I didn't even finish it, I threw it in the garbage.  I've ordered only twice from this spot and now, with this experience, I will NEVER order again.  Be careful ordering this week."}
{"text":"I am so super grossed out right now.  I love papa John's pizza it's my all time favorite. But I will never eat here again.  While ideas in there waiting for my food. I watched a young man (Dylan) wipe the sweat from his forehead and scratched at a pimple, then went back to preparing  the dough for the pizza.. He did not wash his hands at all..  when u work with food it is so important to wash ur hands.  And on top of that his hair wasn't even pulled back in a pony tail.  He has long enough hair. Everyone else's hair was pulled up and had a hay on...  not happy and very grossed out"}
{"text":"The dough was under cooked and so were the wings. It was a year since I ordered Papa Johns. Never Again!!!!"}
{"text":"It's pizza.  Even when it's bad...How does that saying go?  Well, even when it's bad it's not all that bad.  But I have had better and it's gotten so bad I will go somewhere else.    Papa John's used to not be so bad - pretty damn good, actually!  6 months or so ago it was very good.  I think (I dont know this for a fact so dont quote me on this) that it's not so good anymore because they are having so many sales for the football games, etc., that they had to go to a different crust.  Was very good...now not so good.  And I'm trying to lose weight so when I get a pizza, I want to expend my fat and calories on something GOOD, that is worth it!    I would come every once in a great while because of the great sales, but I wouldnt make this my neighborhood go-to place for pizza.  Back to Marco's!"}
{"text":"I usually never have problems with Papa John's. However,At least y'all received  y'all Pizza I paid for mines and didn't even get it. Smh  I guess a worker took it home."}
{"text":"Not worth spending your money here your better off ordering from Pizza Hut or Dominos. The delivery service is terrible."}
{"text":"Not happy with this place. First, when asked about specials they only said there was one, but it showed 3 different ones online. Pizza got here quick, which seemed great at the time. That is until I took a bite and got a mouthful of raw dough! Called and they said they would send out a new one within a half hour. 55 minutes later, no pizza. Called again and apparently the girl who I talked to sent our pizza to the wrong house so now we get to wait another half hour. NEVER AGAIN"}
{"text":"Online orders are a cinch and delivery is only $1.99 plus a tip.    They give killer deals, especially when the Cardinals score touchdowns and win.  On the backs of the hard-working football players, I got two large pizzas with 6 (!) toppings each for only $8.99 each.  And, of course Papa John's makes the best pizza that is absolutely delicious.  Nom-Nom-Nom, dip pizza in garlic-butter sauce, soak for 3 seconds then enjoy a big bite and worry about working it off later!  :)"}
{"text":"Placed a huge order online... Was sent e-mail confirmation, told 40-50 minutes for delivery... Arrived 75 minutes later, an all the food was COLD! Spend your money somewhere else."}
{"text":"I have gotten sick 2 out of the three times I have ordered here. One time, the pizza crust was noticeably undercooked and doughy. The wings are not even remotely good. They are slimey and very fatty. Hate to leave bad reviews but as this is the only place that can deliver on base, I am gravely dissatisfied with the quality."}
{"text":"Pizza  that is made right, except when you click on the wrong thing...and even then they fixed it. Tonight I didn't select delivery but I thought I did. We waited, then called. They are bringing it now. I can be an idiot, but this place helps me get over it."}
{"text":"The customer service is great!!! Recommend this location. All the staff went above and beyond. This is the first time having Papa Johns and we like it. Pizza and garlic knots are good."}
{"text":"I love pizza, but this was the worst I have ever had.  I ordered a pepperoni and mushroom and never tasted an ingredient other than cardboard crust... did I tell you I love pizza?  Not a hint of pepperoni let alone mushroom.  I also ordered eight medium wings, vinegar is all I can say about the taste.  Falling off the bone, but vinegar.  Delivery was satisfactory+.  Bottom line, I don't see how this chain makes it?  I prefer Peter Piper with extra sauce all day long on a $14.00 budget pizza."}
{"text":"Of the top pizza delivery chains, Papa John's takes it. I have worked as a delivery driver for a Papa Johns in the past, and though I hated the one I worked at. They really do have the freshest ingredients and their dough is fresh and is not frozen like pizza hut (also worked there). They are usually on the longer side when it comes to delivery times but its worth the extra weight for its freshness. They also use heated delivery pouches so the pizza is always super hot when it is delivered."}
{"text":"Decent but not consistently good. On weekends the pizza seems much better. Sometimes boring and just barely cooked, sometimes has more flavor and include some interesting dipping sauces on the side."}
{"text":"Pizza is decent. Papa John's is probably my favorite out of all the big pizza chains. Thick crust, comes with a garlicky dipping sauce, lots of toppings, good sauce, and plenty of coupons available. Got our order correct, it was fast and employees are friendly.  Best pizza I ever had? No, but decent take out pizza and maybe the best option in town."}
{"text":"I order from here very often, if I pick up the employees are always so friendly but I usually opt for delivery later at night when my children are sleeping. They ALWAYS pay attention to my order... I don't like a lot of pizza sauce on my pizza so I put light sauce and it's always perfect, I also put in the notes to please not ring my doorbell and they never do! Nothing is overlooked with these guys! Plus they are fast and the drivers are always super friendly!"}
{"text":"With spending over $65 before tip, you'd think your pizza would arrive NOT crushed, but it was. I am very disappointed in this since we ordered very early, before opening even. You'd think one of the first orders of the day you'd want to be correct and edible. Our pizzas were made but not as we ordered. This is quite sad. 3 pizzas, 3 other items. One crushed pizza, one pizza with incorrect toppings and the extra sauce that was paid for and on the receipt wasn't there. Go, papa John's Pizza! You win the screw up award for today."}
{"text":"From the other reviews I wasn't expecting to enjoy my pizza but I was pleasantly surprised. It's definitely not the best chain pizza out there but it was good. I had walk in large pizza, 3 toppings and 4 pop for  $20. The pizza is pretty heavy so it filled me and my wife up easily.  Just because there's quite a few better pizza joints out there for a similar price I probably won't eat here again but I don't regret trying Papa John's"}
{"text":"Pizza was okay but the driver wanted to call the cops after because she heard us yelling at our grandma because she couldn't hear. If your in an argument and papa johns shows up they'll call the cops! Lol"}
{"text":"This is probably the best of the national chains.   Food arrived within quoted time and was hot and made correctly. Pizza is very good, but the locals have them beat by a mile.   Garlic-parmesan breadsticks were great. \"Pan\" pizza was not. Who do they think they are fooling with this offering? It was thinner than that abomination at Donato's. Yes, we are in a regional test market, so hopefully the feedback they get forces them to change or abandon this idea. Overall though it was a good pizza."}
{"text":"I just have to say, I haven't eaten at Papa Johns in a long time because of a bad experience there. But this most recent experience with Filipe I believe was his name on the register was great.  I ordered my pizza at around 9:20 pm after heading home from Craig park. Came right over to pay for it and I forgot to add a Rootbeer to the order. Put it on no problem, no attitude or anything. He was so friendly and so kind it really changed how I felt about the place.  So I paid for the pizza, nugget bits, and cheesy bread. A little pricy from what I am used to paying but honestly, it was so worth it!  I was waiting in the car for the pizza and Filipe even brought it out to us!! What?!?  I don't know but his customer service and just how nice and friendly he was, was such a great way to end the night.  And not to leave out the pizza but damn was it good!!!  We will most definitely be back because Filipe really made this experience great and such a lasting impression. Thank you Filipe for the pizza last night, it was awesome!!!"}
{"text":"Since relocating further to the NW, I've used PJ's multiple times for both carry out and delivery. The location is, hands down, much better than my previous PJ's experiences. I have just recently downloaded the phone app and have been impressed. I can order quickly from anywhere and have it delivered or pick it up on the way to the homestead. The double cheeseburger pizza was surprisingly tasty. The pepperoni is average and the chicken wings are as good or better than similar joints. This past time I was told fifteen to twenty-five minutes for my pies and wings and It was actually closer to thirty-five. Even hall-of-famers fall short seven out of ten times, right? I will be back, as I visit frequently when it is my night to cook."}
{"text":"I called to order a pizza for pick up at 9:40. The teenage girl who answered the phone didn't even answer properly and I had to ask to make sure i called papa Johns. She then proceeded to make sure that I knew that they closed and locked their doors in 20 minutes and that I needed to be there before they closed. The girl was very rude and unprofessional. Customer service was below poor from the moment I called to going and picking up the pizza."}
{"text":"Called in to make an order. Guadalupe answered and I immediately asked if they had any other specials besides the one she just mentioned when answering the phone. She then asked if I could be put on hold because she had to \"save something.\" I was on hold for over 4 minutes when I decided to hang up and call in again. Guadalupe picked up and immediately said her greeting but also said \"Can you hold please\" and put me on hold, I didn't even get a chance to say anything. So I'm waiting again, and was already contemplating to find a different pizza place. After a couple minutes she came back and asked if we wanted the special. Continued to place the order and she had an attitude when I would ask questions such as how many pieces wings they had and if they could do one plain no sauce but buffalo sauce on the side and she made a comment like why would you get plain and then ask for the sauce on the side.. so I mentioned we had children that eat wings and cannot have spicy. After making the order, I asked how long the wait was for delivery and she said 1.5 hrs. It was I believe a quarter till 11pm when we called on a Sunday night.. I don't know how bust they could be at that time but ok. We asked if we could just pick it up. She said carry out was already closed. I again mentioned we had kids and didn't want them waiting to long so I said I would call back, if we didn't find another other place that could do it sooner. We called Marcos Pizza and placed an order with them. We asked about delivery time and also if we could pick up. They mentioned they close in 10min. I asked how soon can they get the pizza ready if we pick up, they said 10-15min, so I said we're on our way since we were already in the car. We got there shortly after 11pm and went in to pay. It wasn't quite ready so we went and waiting in the car. A few minutes later they walk it out to us.   Papa Johns's has always been my favorite cause they have the best wings. But my experience last night made me find a different pizza place, a new one that I haven't eaten from before. Not only were they able to accommodate our hungry children at closing, their customer service was awesome and food tasted awesome. Wings were my favorite! I have now found my newest favorite pizza place."}
{"text":"If you read any of my experiences they are going to be negative. That's what someone that is a professional customer service person will do when they recieve extremely poor service. You may find a good one. But I believe in thhat sharing poor service is most important to shed light on the rapidly growing problem. This place can't even answer the phone right and they hang up on you and its just idiotic. Done with Papa Johns for good"}
{"text":"I order online most of the time, good timing. Friendly drivers, good taste. I usually ask for well done on my pizza. Love the wings"}
{"text":"Spoke with Randy the manager this evening. We had a large and complicated order and he ever so nicely in the most personable professional way worked everything out PERFECTLY! 100% guest satisfaction! I just moved to wax haw so I hope there will be more EXCELLENT encounters with Randy and the crew he's running!"}
{"text":"As far as \"pizza chains\" go, I must say, this branch does a nice job with staffing. The service is always fast, and the workers are always friendly. You can order online, and generally they have a special or two going. When I pickup carry-out pizza, I normally place the pizza into a couple pizza-warmer sleeves I bought at Trader Joe's a couple years ago (they work well). My last visit, the girl even took my sleeves and placed the pizzas in them for me. It was a small gesture, but nice. As far as the pizza goes, I find the thin crust pizza to be pretty good; however, I am not a fan of the regular pizza (too much doughy crust for me). My kids really like the cheesy bread."}
{"text":"Shen is phenomenal! Quality pizza in a timely manner. His drivers go the extra mile to ensure great service."}
{"text":"So every once in a while, you just want a pizza night, especially when it's raining And might snow. And having a Papa John's at my college years ago, I still get occasional cravings for their cheese bread. It's simply my favorite cheese bread.   I received a 50 percent code via text so ordered a The Works, Cheese bread and Cinnamon bites via phone on my way home. I take the bus so no distracted driving here. When I got there, it was super busy. The worker at the front was on the phone taking an order. Others were frantically making pizzas. Finally someone asked if he could help anyone who had already paid. Since I paid online, I was able to pickup pretty quickly. I highly recommend ordering online and I like customizing my pizza since the husband doesn't like olives.   When I got home, the Cheese bread was missing the dipping sauce. I love the crust on the pizza and it tasted fine. The cinnamon bites were pull apart pieces which was convenient since I only wanted a little bit. It was warm and had a good bit of the melted icing which was a perfect marriage with cinnamon and dough.   Convenient online ordering, good pizza, but customer service in the store could be better and some more quality checks to make sure things aren't missing."}
{"text":"Papa John's Pizza is good, not great.  I do like the pepperccinis they include with each pizza.  I will say I was pleasantly surprised by how good the wings are and order those pretty often.  The best part about Papa Johns though is the app.  It has all local specials listed and you earn points for ordering which add up to a free pizza.  There are a lot of really cheap specials, particularly tied to Indians or Browns games, so I find it to be a good value.  Plus you can track your pizza as its being made and know when it's on the way for delivery."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I have been going to this location a couple months now...and I gotta say the service and quality has gotten worse and worse. We ordered square cut and they did not do that. Next time, we got a pizza with absolutely NO SAUCE- we did get a free pizza after that but it was not square cut we did not bother going back a third time. Also, we ordered a square cut pizza again tonight and they didn't bother to do it again. Not only that, when we went to go pick up our pizza tonight the three guys there seemed super careless about everything. Three times in a row they messed up our order, we aren't going to come back again, very disappointed."}
{"text":"Only wish I could have given them 0 stars. I ordered my food over an hour and a half ago and it still isn't here. Called the store twice and they keep saying the driver will be here shortly. I totally regret ordering from them."}
{"text":"Love having Papa John's closer to us.  Delivery was very fast and they even brought paper plates and napkins.  I don't think any Papa John's has done that before.  Pizza was cooked just right!"}
{"text":"This is by far the worst papa johns I've ever placed an order with!! I ordered a pizza with easy instructions and they still failed to send the right pizza... They forgot something on my pizza but because they had ran out! No one bothered to call and tell me, they sent the pizza as it was. Anyways I called them and a worker supposably wrote me down in a book and give me credit for one free pizza... He said he talked to his manager!! I called to place an order a few days later and there's no sign of that anywhere... Horrible service. Be good to loyal customers!"}
{"text":"I ordered 1 pizza, I live 8 minutes away. The Manager Tim told me 35-45 minutes. 90 minutes later I call back & ask when it would be there. He said in 10 minutes. 30 minutes later I call back & cancel the order. Another 30 minutes passes & the pizza boy calls me & says he's here. At this point it had been over 2 hours & I was already eating Canes (Tempe location is amazing btw).   1.) The Manager hungup On me 2) he never refunded my money (but did take the pizza back)   Then days later I call in again to get my money refunded my another Male Manager. 5 days later my money never came back!  This place is trash. I don't normally write reviews as I'm a busy person, but 25 dollars to starve for two hours is bull. 2 seconds away from showing up."}
{"text":"Very poor. Ordered 1 pizza at 18:20, email received indicating that the pizza would be delivered in 30 - 40 minutes.  At 45 minutes, telephoned the store and was told sorry, internet timing was incorrect, actual wait time would be 45 - 60 mins.  Told it's the next pizza to be delivered, should be 5 - 10 mins.  At least 15 - 20 mins. later, pizza finally arrived.  No apology, nothing.  So, from being 30 - 40 mins., pizza actually arrived in 60 - 70 mins.  Apparently you're required to award 1 star... which in this case is 1 star too many."}
{"text":"We order pizza candad bacon and peperion and there was no peperion in the pizza at all we call and complain they said there were gonna replace with another pizza and cinnmon aparts and it been 1 hour and nothing came yet so we can they lied us too. Next thing in da morning we gonna called the corpated and complain to them bout .we talk to the manger in training amd she promise us a.free pizza and cinnamon aparts she lied they never come. First ia call corapte make sure some people lose there jobs . And the pizza were so sloppy . No start for you. Plus the pizza was uncooked and to doughy"}
{"text":"Better ingredients Doubt it... Had a spicy Italian pizza, mind you the last time, I had PJ's pizza  like kid you not-14 years ago!!! The sausage is garbage,fake and not real Italian sausage obviously and the Pizza sauce is so bland as can be.... See you in another 14 years Pappa Johns and your gay Camaro, Thx for the one pepperchini- it was the Best way to wash down the terrible flavors...."}
{"text":"OMG!!!!! Well fool me once shame on you, fool me twice shame on me! Should have taken the coupon for the free pizza from last week's incident although in all fairness with the exception of getting the name wrong and last minute making the pizza to meet the time frame all was well that ended well! Fast forward a week and clearly my very easy name ANA becomes a longer version of Hannah not the big deal except once I'm there they are looking for Ana and can't find it. So I ordered an XL the works same thing every time and this week They get the name wrong and the order wrong. Asked for the mgr \"Ashley\" she wasn't having my attitude and disdain opinion of their lack luster performance and even less me saying for them to get their \"shit\" together because she felt I was cursing. She proceeded to tell me that she had been transferred to that store to \"get it together\" and I clearly see why now. She stated it would take longer than a week I'm sure I could give her months and the same staff will mess your order up every time or the next sucker anyways. Her response was to refund me as if I'm going to be happy with that. Nope not in need of a free meal just the one I order and pay for. She ends up walking away and closing the drive thru window because she didn't want to hear me point out the obvious and the opinion about the lack luster performance of her staff! Coming from Cali where they have never been a disappointment I thought I could trust the brand, quality and customer service but not here at this location. Don't expect it from them at least anytime soon. Good luck to those who will try! Maybe they'll get their shit together by then. Sooner than later is good!"}
{"text":"The location on Main St is now closed and moved to 63 N. Greenfield Rd. Ste 101 MESA, AZ 85205.  It is what it is - cheap pizza delivered.  It's one of the few places that delivers to my address and for that they get the 3rd star and a 4th star because they are always quick and friendly.  I'm not comparing the pizza to \"good\" pizza, but when I have a taste for greasy and salty pizza, Papa John's fills the need cheap and quick.  What more could I ask?"}
{"text":"Worst customer service, worst quality, Papa Johns - that's what Papa Johns should change their slogan to."}
{"text":"This is a great location as far as Papa John's go. Orders are always perfect and pizza isn't undercooked like some locations. Friendly staff too"}
{"text":"Called in after my pizza was never delivered, the manager (Dylan) said my order had already been delivered, after speaking with him for about 10 mins his story changes to they \"never received my order\". They could not find my order, those pizzas were never made and they couldn't verify my account based off my phone number. He gave me a phone number to call to see what I could do about getting a refund since my account had already been charged. While on the phone with him, a delivery driver arrives with the pizzas we ordered. Dylan then stated that this sometimes happens and they are just too busy.   Maybe Dylan and the rest of the Papa John's team should learn how to do their job.   Will not be ordering from Papa John's again."}
{"text":"Delivery from this location are uselessly on time .The quality of pizza is what is expected for Papa Johns John's. but be careful using online ordering. They will mess your order up, any extras will not come, toppins will be different from what you ordered, its guaranteed every time."}
{"text":"I ordered a couple of pies from this location for pick up. I was a little reluctant after reading the customer service reviews... But soon as I walked in I felt welcome.   They had all the employees in the back shouting out welcome, and wishing me farewell when I was departing. Service was prompt and the gentleman helping me was very nice and polite. You can tell that they have probably read these reviews and are trying to up their game.  Oh, and of course the pizza was delicious! Thanks, papa johns crew on Cimarron! Keep up the good work!"}
{"text":"I ordered off of PapaJohns.com (worldwide). I ordered cheesy bread and wings. It all arrived in 30 minutes. The bread was decent; not as good as Sardella's though. The Honey Chipotle wings were hot, slightly crispy, and pretty much what I expected from wings. I made sure I gave the driver a big tip.   https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=1ElpE-THkRE  Papa bless."}
{"text":"I have tasted a lot of pizza places believe me and Papa John's is the best so far!  Others are close....  The owner seems pretty nice even though have not met them.  Just because a location messes up your order doesnt mean that the pizza isnt the best.  They just have the right ingredients.  I wish they brought their pan pizza back becasue it s better than PHs This pizza is way better than PP  which a lot of my friends like including my son.  Papa john is right when he says better ingredients.  I just wish they wouldnt charge for delivery and I will make sure I get the 50% discount every time. Ha!"}
{"text":"I would say poor service. But I have gotten NO service. They close late, yet they do not allow people in too take my order. I definitely will not take my money here and spend it. It would have been understanding if it was explained but all I got was a head movement saying that they were closed.  Thank you for the heads up not too come back."}
{"text":"Absolutely terrible, terrible service.  I got hung up on and had to call back over 5 times because the person answering phone was ill-equipped to help me and when asking for a manager, they kept refusing by not saying anything or simply hanging up.  Very disappointing as I love Papa Johns."}
{"text":"I ordered on line and it said 30-40 minutes well that was wrong took an hour. Then the pizzas are wrong and I double check my confirmation email and I was right the pizzas are wrong. I called them and they argued that I was wrong. I read my confirmation email and they said I don't know what to tell you that's not what it's says here. Go elsewhere it's not worth the hassle."}
{"text":"I did nastygram via email the Corporate office. A few das later I recieved the generic response from corporate i kinda thought that was lame. a few weeks after that The Ft. Apache manager called and she hooked me up with a credit. It took a minute but i got a refund and that's cool."}
{"text":"I ordered a extra large pizza from this store.  We paid for delivery.  The order was placed at 530pm.  The order did not arrive until 650 pm.  I literally live not even 3 minutes from the store location.  I called at an hour to find out where the pizza was and was told it was on the way.  At 1 hour and 20 minutes I called the store location again and spoke with a manager named Trinity.  She stated that the pizza was on the way as well.  The pizza arrived approximately 2 minutes after the call to the manager Trinity.  I spoke with the driver and asked why it took so long and he stated that they only had 3 drivers and the approximate wait time was 1 hour and 20 minute.  I paid the driver and when I got the pizza inside it was not even warm anymore."}
{"text":"This particular location is the closest to me so of course this is where we usually order from. Decent wait time but I recommend placing your order online so you get the best deals. The food is always fresh and hot. The service is great as well. We have only had one issue in the past with an order/staff but it was taken care of promptly, and politely."}
{"text":"The pizza at Papa is not really good. That has nothing to do with the location, this is just not a italien pizza for me. At least if you spend time in Italy you know this is not italien. I buy it because the hubby and kids want pizza, but tonight I had to experience something that nobody that works in the customer service business should do to their customers. I wanted to pay for my pizzas, I had 2 Gift Cards still at home that I wanted to get rid of. One had $0.80 and the other $16.36. I'm just wanted to use them and all I hear is stupid comments about my Gift Cards. What is it your business how much are on them or how many I use. As long as I pay my bill. I felt disrespected and picked on as a customer. Do your job and let me pay and leave. I had to remind them like always, that I paid for 2 extra garlic, that were nowhere to see in my pizza boxes.  2 weeks ago I was in there, the one who was making the pizza was dealing with money with a driver. He walks back to make pizza and all I scream behind him, can't you wash your hands, you just touched money. Really!"}
{"text":"This location doesn't even deserve a star. Literally the WORST customer service I've ever experienced. Made a delivery order. Called an hour and 15 mins later asking where my order was. Employee on the phone says i never made an order. Didn't even try to remedy the situation after I explained that we made an order and that whom ever took it messed up. Never ordering from any Papa Johns again. Order at your own risk."}
{"text":"Don't bother ordering anything but a regular pizza. No matter what you order, they deliver regular crust. If you order thin crust, they deliver regular. If you order a pan pizza, they deliver regular. Never fails. They don't give a f* what you want, you're getting a regular."}
{"text":"The worst delivered pizza every half of it was missing cheese and the slices weren't  even cut properly! Never again"}
{"text":"Id say it was about a month ago that I ate here. I was super skeptical about eating here because of the other reviews given. But I got the dipper pizza. I picked it up, it was ready when I arrived. Omg! I stuffed my face! Great pizza, no complaints. The staff was nice."}
{"text":"I'm sad. I usually really like Papa John's. This was my first time ordering at this location. I put an order in online and prepaid with my cc. An hour passes and still no pizza. (fyi it's Wednesday night and I live one mile away) I give them a call and ask about my order. The guy puts me on hold and comes back after a minute or two saying that his driver is leaving now.. I should have canceled my order because when the pizza arrived it was COLD and cardboard box hard. Ahh I'm so irritated. I had to put it in the microwave to make it consumable :(  3 bites and I'm done. Wasted my money and time. I will never order or recommend this location."}
{"text":"Papa John pizza itself is mediocre at best. I've never went out of the way to order them and when I have ordered them I always wished for a better pizza.  The pizza is pretty bland and isn't much better than a cafeteria pizza. The more pizza you try the more you will dislike this place. Out of the major chains this is one place I can't order anymore. Find a local place or go with another pizza place."}
{"text":"Have tried 2,3 times this year with the baseball deals. Good value for those deals and I think they also have special promos every so often.  I like the pizza, and I like there is another option in the area.  Will definitely return, and maybe try some other items in the future."}
{"text":"We order pizza from this location on a regular basis.  The pizza is always hot, and consistent every time.  Its the usual Papa John's pizza which I always enjoy.  The staff at this location are pretty good, and the food is always ready when you go to pickup after ordering.  This is a pickup only location.  The shop is pretty clean though some of the staff may look a little questionable."}
{"text":"I love Pj Pizza but my order was wrong. Oh well it happens. I called and spoke to Anna (assist mgr) she fixed it all up in a jiffy. No arguments, no fuss and all taken care of. Nice to feel like your business matters. Especially in a competitive biz like pizza. :)"}
{"text":"I used to grab a pie from this 'za joint at least once a week. I stopped for a short period of time giving myself a tolerance break from this delicious pizza addiction. Last night, however, I was feeling a bit frisky. I splurged a whole 9$ on a large pepperoni and 3-cheese blend pie with normal bake and normal sauce. I was overjoyed when I walked to grab my carry-out pizza. 5 minutes later my joy and happiness turned to disgust and regret. As I opened the cardboard vessel, I was greeted with the single largest pool of pizza grease I've ever witnessed. I lived in New York for several years, worked at several different pizza places and and consumed tons of pizza. I have never seen a pizza so grossly swimming in a literal pool of grease. As you can imagine, I soaked several paper towels in grease while blotting up this disgusting mess.   Thanks for ruining my dinner and taking my money. Buyer beware.   With respect and sauce,  -Tyler"}
{"text":"I no longer feel that Papa John's is worth having.  Despite having a promo code that works (literally always) for 50% off of my order, the food is just too bleh.  I choose Domino's if I'm looking for fast food pizza, and Jet's Pizza in Huntersville if I'm looking for premium pizza."}
{"text":"Don't waste your time here, honestly, Domino's is 2 minutes down the road and has great customer service and better pizza.    I have had a few disappointments at this particular Papa John's (Statesville Rd., N. Charlotte.)    The one time I ordered delivery from this location, it took about 90 minutes.  This is somewhat extraordinary considering this location is approximately 3 miles away on a set of wide open highways.  I used the papajohns.com website to lodge a complaint about my order being wrong one time.  The toppings were wrong on a pizza and they gave me 10\" cheesesticks instead of the 12\" that I paid for.  The manager of this location did promptly email me and offer apologies, which I appreciate.  He also offered to \"make it right\" if I came back in, so I presume he was offering a free or discounted dinner.  I replied and declined the offer, but asked that he just manage his store better.  There was another occasion that I carried out from this location and employees were bickering with each other.  One employe was berated another employee (appeared to be a newer employee) for not answering the phone.  They proceeded to have a snarky exchange right in front of me.. 5 feet away literally.  Completely no shame about the unprofessionalism, laugh.  Speaking of unprofessional.. the employees here are generally uncivilized.  With every trip that I have made to this location (approx 6-8) except for one time, the employees (with Papa John's delivery signs affixed to vehicles) are unabashed about parking in the handicap and \"carry-out only\" spots.  The last two visits, the same black female parked her car (with a handicapped parking placard no less, heh she was very \"mobile\" to me) right at the entrance/exit to the store.  It was literally blocking traffic.  She didn't care at all.  She parked the car and walked in to grab her next order for delivery.  I watched her to this twice in one week.  (I had a gift card that took two trips to exhaust.)    I am posting pictures of her parking job and the fact that there were open spots 15 feet away from the entrance.  In summary, this Papa John's is wholly pathetic and I would avoid it."}
{"text":"Horrible place. Mixup my order delivered wrong pizza. Called manager then after an hour passed still no correction."}
{"text":"Worst papa johns experience ever, ordered a pizza at 7:20 online. Chilled at the house because they told me it would take about 15-20 minutes to be ready. Decided to pick up some drinks and arrived at the papa johns around 7:40 or so, paid for the pizza and they said it would be right out. Ended up waiting another 30 minutes in the store for my pizza. Better ingredients, better pizza, longer wait... papa johns!!   Pizza was good and the deal was nice since we used the Charlotte Hornets promo code and the entire order was half off. So maybe the employees gave us half effort preparing my pizza as well."}
{"text":"This place has really gone done hill and they make no apologies. I have ordered many a pizzas from here and service has been like a plane crashing. Last few order have taken over 45 min to pick up from the time I ordered them. One time it took and hour and 11 min. No apologies and every time I asked about my order it was the same response just 5 minutes. It was five minutes 20 minutes ago.  Come on.  You guys didn't make my pizza yet. I've just moved on."}
{"text":"I ordered online delivery. The pizza arrived safely and the driver was polite. My complaint is the taste. The pizza was very bland and lacking flavor. Next time I want a pizza delivered I'll stick with Dominos."}
{"text":"For nights I want a cheap and quick pie, Papa John's is my go-to.   This review is based on many orders for pickup. I live nearby, so I have not experienced delivery service. I have never had any issues with this location. This is your standard papa johns, everything I have ordered is on par with other locations. My order is always correct and ready when I arrive. The brief interaction with the staff here has been pleasant."}
{"text":"Beyond excellent service.  Aaron is a super nice guy. Was beyond super patient as I struggle with my order on my phone app.  Seriously he was extremely patient especially during a busy time.  I some how screwed up my order on my phone.  Thanks for your kindness.    Great pizza too. Very generous with their toppings."}
{"text":"THE RUDEST PEOPLE I HAVE EVER MET. ordered a pizza almost two hours ago. have yet to receive. then i call the store back to see what happened (reminding you i'm a loyal customer with an account) and the lady tells me she will call him to see what happened. the delivery driver calls me and he says i gave him the wrong phone number. when i explained to him that it was a store credit and they looked up my account to give me the pizza he called me a liar ! so i told him nevermind l. just called the manager back to complain. he just says ok. and hangs up just lost a loyal customer ."}
{"text":"This location has finally lost my business. Even when I select \"well done\" on the crust they seem to always deliver pizzas that aren't even cooked through and im left with a pizza that cannot be eaten. So long Papa!"}
{"text":"This pizza place is okay. The pizza is not the best but it's exceptional. The best thing there I think is the chicken Alfredo. It's the best with parmesan cheese and red crushed peppers. That's what I love at papa johns"}
{"text":"Such horrible customer service. Called the place to ask for deals and got out on hold for a few minutes. Once they answered it was a whole different person and kept giving attitude while I was asking info. Went in personally to view deals and the girl was giving attitude again. Another guy \"I'm assuming the manager\" came to help and was also very rude. When paying, I gave him my card and he snatched it and threw it to the counter after while I had my hand sticking out to grab it. never again will I come back to this place. Oh and to mention, once the girl got done helping us she went back to making pizzas without washing her hands."}
{"text":"I ordered a pizza for carryout at 532 pm, I arrived at about 630 pm. They said that my order still wasn't ready. I waited until 720 pm after checking with them a couple times. I then had to have them give me a refund. They wasted 50 minutes of my time in the store and didn't even apologize. I would never go back to this store."}
{"text":"Our foreign exchange student, Zeno, was duly impressed with the fact that he could get TWO large pizzaa for UNDER $20. He was not so impressed however with the idea of spinach on his pie...  What else can I say-- it's close, cheap, consistant, and realtively good."}
{"text":"I've ordered pizzas from this Papa John's location for over 4 years. My pizzas are always fresh and I've never been dissatisfied. Whenever I pick up my pizzas, the staff is always incredibly friendly and efficient. Online orders go through, what seems to be instantaneous. I really do appreciate their quality pizzas and helpful staff."}
{"text":"If I could give zero stars, I would! I called to check if my address was good for delivery, the employee who answered said my address was good to go and we could place our delivery. I told him I would have to call him back so I can check with my co-workers what exactly we were going to order (He was actually very nice in tone, I do not remember his name) I checked with everyone what exactly we were going to order and I called right back (in a matter of 5 minutes) this time Ashley (GM) answered the phone, when she asked for my address she said \"We do not deliver to that area, it's a dead zone\" she was really rude and not helpful at all. I mentioned to her that I had just called 5 minutes ago. She did not care or even apologized for the inconvenience. Smh to the General Manager."}
{"text":"Ok, so we've been ordering from this location for about a year and half sense we moved into our apartment  that is   5 mins away, at first things were great but the last 3times we ordered from them were totally gross and cold. How hard is it to get a extra extra cheese and pepperoni pizza right? We got barley any cheese and who ever cut the pizza needs to go back to pizza cutting school how hard is it to cut a pizza into 8  almost even  slices. I mean it's not rocket science! And like I said we live not even 5 mins away so no reason it should have been cold, our estmated wait time was 26-36 mins and after an hour we decided to take our dogs out and to our surprise there's the delivery driver sitting in her car on her phone texting for an addtional 15 mins and we just sat there and watched her and my husband recorded it. I mean come on this is ridiculous . I don't think we will be ordering from this papa johns again unless things change!!!!!"}
{"text":"We were staying at a local hotel and used online ordering to feed our crew.  The ordering went smoothly and the pleasant surprise was the food arrived early and warm.  We ordered two of their usual pizzas and one of our custom orders.  Could have had a few more toppings on one of them, but overall nice value and timely service with warm food.  We looked for the specials on-line and save a few dollars.  Worth the time to do so.  Would order again."}
{"text":"Much better than Pizza Pizza, Dominos or Pizza Hut. Prices are comparable. I love this location. Delivery area is very small."}
{"text":"Just so disappointed!!!  Nothing worse than cold pizza that doesn't have the toppings that your ordered.  Wednesday night early....... whats the problem..  I'm going to go back to Rosatti's"}
{"text":"Nice kids working in the pizza shop. Pizza is consistently good. Always tastes fresh. Decent amount of toppings. Maybe could use a little more on top but not bad. Fair prices. Not sure what else people are looking for in a pizza joint. I keep coming back."}
{"text":"Messed up our pizza called to complain offered to replace it they never did they are one f***** up Papa John's wish I could put no damn Stars"}
{"text":"Just ordered delivery. 2 large pizzas, bread sticks, 1 small gluten free cheese pizza. We've ordered gluten free from there often, but never received a completely burnt pizza. Even the cheese was burnt! See pics. When we called and asked to speak to the manager, he was extremely rude and dismissive. His attitude was basically tough - that's what they look like. As frequent customers, we know differently. We will no longer order from this location.    Update - we went to the front office of our business location about an hour later. Laying on the front counter was a new pizza. Apparently the delivery person walked in, slammed it down without a word and walked out. It wasn't as burnt, but since we didn't even know to watch for it, it was cold by the time we knew it was there."}
{"text":"Glen \"the manager\" was extremely rude !! Not only did he talk to me rudely but also hung up in my face when I was asking him questions about when the money will be put back in my account after being charged wrongly . Never will I order from this location !!"}
{"text":"The worst customer service I have ever seen. The clerks had the attention span of a five year old. The call taker was rude and unprofessional. I don't recommend this place to anyone."}
{"text":"I normally do not write bad reviews, but here we go. The setup of this call ahead & drive thru only when I went there was NOT appealing to me. Also I am not normally a papa John's kinda guy. I Prefer Barros Pizza. But hey we just moved that day & was NOT in the mood to cook, no dishes unpacked, no food in the frig, well you get the idea. But I was Hangry haha & so we went. The service was ok but everyone appeared new, I would ask a question, then they would look over there shoulder & ask someone else, that person would then look around and ask someone else, it was kinda crazy. The pizza was umm ok, I feel other choices are available in close proximity that offer a better deal, better service & better pizza. I personally would NOT eat here again, that in combination with the owner blaming NFL players for for sales being down, com on now. Over all I am disappointed in this company & my family will NOT support ANY longer."}
{"text":"I wish Yelp did half and quarter stars. This Papa John's would be a 2.75 star. Papa John's in general would be a 4 star.   The reason this store gets a lower rating is because of the following e-mai I sent to there corporate office and the response I received. here is the e-mail I sent: Monday 11/29/2011 I placed my order on-line at 9:30pm. At 10:20pm I still had not received my order. I called the store and after waiting on hold for several minutes someone picked up and said sorry we're closed. I told them I placed an on-line order almost an hour ago and still have not received it. He asked my last name and after I gave it to him and he said to hold a minute he said \"it left awhile ago and should be there soon\" and then hung up. Not even giving me the chance to ask or say anything else! The driver showed up at 10:28pm and gave me my pizza and asked for payment. That's it not a sorry we were late or anything. He actually seemed annoyed and even though the pizza was late and service was bad I gave him a $3 tip. The pizza was below normal standards and the service/delivery time was awful! The way the pizza tasted and the way I was treated and with the delivery time it seemed like I was the last order of the night and they were pissed off to have to deal with it. If you don't\"t want to serve your customers good food in a timely manner then don't except the order if it's later then you want. I order a minimum of once a month from pappa johns, sometime more. This is the worst experience ever. If I would have received a \"hey sorry were late\" or something, I would not be writing you. However the pizza took close to an hour to get to my door and it was not the normal supper hot great tasting pizza. Very disappointed and will not be ordering for a long while. Thank you for your time.  To there credit I did get a phone call from the store manager, I think. He left me a voice mail asking to call him back so I can give him details. I didn't save the message so I didn't have the number to call him back. I'm a little surprised they didn't try a second time or contact me via e-mail or snail mail. I'm a chef at corporate run restaurant and when we have an upset guest we bend over backwards to contact them and make them happy. One voice-mail was all I got!   I love Papa Johns and if the website would let me pick a different store I would start ordering again. But for now I've sworn them off for the foreseeable future."}
{"text":"This review is for the store on Sharon Rd. West.  Haven't been down there in a while so not sure if it is still on SRW.  This place was right next door to our apt complex so I began delivering for them pt.  Easy to bring home a hundred bucks for a four/five hour shift.  Once delivered to George Shinn's home. (one time owner of the Hornets)  I heard that we were the fourth busiest store in the company at the time.  I believe it.  I have left there with eight deliveries in my car at one time.  Better ingredients,  better pizza,  awesome drivers."}
{"text":"This is my husbands' favorite pizza place, I mean Papa Johns, not this location. I do not like the pizza here and he does not Due Amici Pizza, which I think it is the best pizza ever. We switch back and forth between the 2 and sometimes try another. The last 3 times we have ordered from this Papa Johns the order has been wrong. the last time I emailed to complain and I was sent a code for a discount on my next order. I was not happy with that, to begin with, because the wrong toppings on the pizza made it uneatable for me and my husband does not eat leftovers, so half the pizza went into the trash. I went to order online with the discount code and it saved me a whopping 50 cents! I was not happy and had wasted even more of my time and then ordered from elsewhere. I emailed again and the reply was to offer a free pizza next time I ordered. I will update when I receive this and find out if I can actually get a correct eatable pizza. This place needs some new management and a training program."}
{"text":"Ordered a pizza and a salad for the second time I got only a cold pizza.  The pizza was so undercooked the cheese was still in chunks. Had to call the phone number three times to get an answer and she was not at all helpful.  She let me know it would be 45 minutes to an hour before he could redeliver the salad."}
{"text":"Use this location often, love the online ordering, never had a bad experience.."}
{"text":"Co-workers and I ordered pizza as we were working thru lunch.  Ordered at 10:22am for a 11:30am delivery.  Called at 11:50am to find out where our pizza was.  Was told it was in transit.  Pizza arrived at 12:00pm.  Pizza was barely warm.  Usually have no issues."}
{"text":"These guys basically make up their own prices!  They don't recognize coupons when they already told what the price would be.  These people would rather have you pay full price if they convinced you to add on ., rather than have a good customer base and give them a deal they can't beat.  These people are greedy -don't go here!"}
{"text":"So I ordered online last night because dinner plans fell through. I've never ordered at this location before so I figured I'd give it a shot. We are in between 2 Papa John's: this one and the one on 43rd and Bell, and spoiler alert, the one on 43rd and Bell is way better.  I finished placing my order at 8.02PM. The email said it'd be 30-40 mins, which is normal so whatever. 8:50ish rolls around...hey, where's my pizza? I called the store, forget the name of the dude, but I asked where my pizza was. He took and look and said and I quote \"he should be coming up right now\". Sweet. I can forgive 10 mins. So I wait. And then wait. Where's the dude? I don't bother to call cause I can almost guarantee they'd say the driver is coming... so now I'm going to see how late they are.  9.05pm...still nothing.  9.10pm...still nothing.  Around 9:20ish, knock on the door! HOORAY! So I answer and the dude didn't say a thing. He had an expressionless look on his face like he knew he'd done bad. I'm like whatever, I was just happy to have my food, cause yeah, my son and I were hungry. I say thanks and he leaves...looking like a lost puppy.  So we sit and start chowing down... hey guess what? Pizza's cooled. Not even the good cool. It was pretty much tasting like it was left out. Oh you want a kicker? Effin' ham was crunchy... no, not the good, slightly burnt crunchy, it was kind of like undercooked crunchy... like it was still partly frozen crunchy... that was nasty stuff.  After we finish I start thinking, no way in hell it takes that long to make pizza and get to my place. Especially on a damn Tuesday night with no events going on. I check the bill and it says they didn't leave the store until 9.02pm... like really? Did you not think I'd check the receipt? Your receipted ratted your ass out that after my pizza was made, it was left on the counter and you didn't make your damn delivery until 9.02 pm. Exactly 1 hour after I had ordered. But wait, didn't you say the driver was about to roll up when I called you at 8.50pm?  This is a crap location and should be ashamed to bear the name 'Papa Johns'. No other Papa John's ever had been this late and made pizza this crap. And has never lied about the driver being on his way. Just wow. Get outta here."}
{"text":"It was a Monday night, went to a super bowl party night before, never put any thought into Monday, my daughter texts me and says hey we want pizza, and I think well that solves my dinner issue for sure!  I have been ordering pizza from this Papa Johns for a couple years now, even ordered them when I hosted the Super Bowl Party last year,  I have never had an issue with them, I even order online, it's so easy breezy, and if you sign up for Papa John emails, you will see 50% off codes all the time and you even earn points for ordering pizza, in fact I think my next order of pizza is free, which is great for me!  When the house is in the mood for pizza, Papa Johns is the one for us!"}
{"text":"Recently tried Papa John's pizza from the location at Eglinton and Markham road. Was pretty good, had it several times over the months and quality was consistent and pizza (and ingredients) were fine.  Unfortunately, that location is presently closed (a month now - due to a breakin?) so tried this location on Kingston Road east of Morningside. Day and night.  Second time now, and again very disappointed, same complaints. Quality of pizza assembly was very low - got a pair (combo deal), one was over cooked, one equally undercooked. In both cases, dough ranged in thickness from a couple of mm to 10+mm randomly over the pizza. Thinnest dough was cooked, thicker was raw, and the dough was tough overall - prepared and stored way too far in advance. Sauce was randomly globbed on, one slice had none, the other dripped when picked up. Toppings were sparse, maybe half of the pepperoni that photos show, but onions (cheap) were piled on.  Franchisee needs to pay attention to quality of assembly and cooking, maybe some supervision would help? I assume they are not a restauranteur, just an entrepreneur.  Avoid this location! Try another and see if Papa John's is for you. When well done, it's OK pizza. When done badly, it's *really* bad. This location has the latter well in hand."}
{"text":"Ordered for carry out and asked about the current special which is 2 large two topping pizzas at $8 each.  Employee stated that special was currently online online and not instore.  Went with their other special instead.  Upon arriving in store, there was a sign outside and on their menu stating that the special was active.  Employee had terrible knowledge of the specials that were currently available. 1 of 2 pizzas ordered were also unavailable which extended my wait time.  Ended up having to order something else."}
{"text":"We had another UFC party at the house, so I ordered pizza from Papa John's this time.  The pizza arrived on time, HOT, and good.    We got 4 pizzas: The Works The Meat Papa John's Special Three Cheeses  Everyone inhaled all the pizza!"}
{"text":"There needs to be an option for a half a star. Or no star. Called on my way home from work to order a pizza to pick up. Got to the front counter before anyone had answered the phone yet (it was on automated pick up for 4 minutes) when I got there the phone was ringing so I hung up my phone so it would stop ringing. The lady working came up to the counter and I told her I've been waiting for someone to pick up the phone for 4 minutes. She told me the phone never rang. REALLY? And as I'm sitting in the waiting area waiting for my pizza I for some reason decided to still order, the guy making the pizzas is cussing up a storm. What a great experience!"}
{"text":"Was better than I expected, I bought the pizza for my grandkids and ate a slice, it was tasty."}
{"text":"I have been to this location a few times before, since I live right around the corner.  The service is never spectacular, but the pizza is always a good deal, especially since I have a coupon through my apartment complex.  Although the last time I went I was told that they do not accept those coupons and that I had to pay the full price for my pizza!  I spoke to the manager who was totally unsympathetic and sounded exhausted when i asked him why I was not able to use it.  I drove all the way there to get my pizza the least they could have done since they new that the coupon was out there is honor it and let me know that in the future they would not be able to honor it.  Very disappointed with the leave of service provided at this location.  Will be going to another location from now on."}
{"text":"Tonight I ordered delivery pizza from this Papa John's store. When we opened the boxes, there was obviously such rough handling that the special garlic sauce cups were actually bent and had leaked all over the pizza, saturating it and making it soggy. It also arrived barely warm, which I don't understand as the store is no more than 10 minutes from my home. Never ever again will I order pizza from Papa John's. I also ordered light sauce and the sauce was spread on so thick it was all I could taste. So disappointing, especially after an extremely exhausting day. They get 2 stars because the cheese sticks were actually done right."}
{"text":"My review is simple ordered two pizzas one pulled pork and one pep and olives had a hastle to even pay by card was hung up on and called back to pay yet again was told \" driver will take info and pay on delivery \" when driver got to house said i was to pay in cash and asked to use my cell phone to call in my debt card for payment  Horrible horrible service never ate papa johns first time and never will again pizza hut service better than papa johns otherwise sammys pizza way togo"}
{"text":"omg Becky, look at the white flour on that pizza... okay not only is this pizza NOT very good, but every time I order on line they mess up my order.  I am so done with you Papa John's.  When I moved I thought well this is the only pizza joint nearby that delivers but I have since found a few others to try.  I only went to you out of inertia. Do NOT, Do NOT try to trick me with the free pizza award for my latest complaint that you gave me extra sauce when I ordered light sauce.  Because i will THROW it away.  I hope I will be giving some other delivery pizza joint a good review soon."}
{"text":"Last night, January 6th, my fiancee and ordered a large pizza and a liter of soda for delivery around 11pm. We understand that it was pretty late, but we were assured that it would be okay. So we placed our order, and 40 minutes later our pizza arrived. We stood outside and we noticed a car that kept driving up and down the street, going pretty fast, then realized it was the delivery driver. So we walked up to help him locate our home. The driver pulled up, rolled down his window, and handed us the pizza and liter of soda through his window. Then he said, and I quote, \"I won't bother you to sign your receipt, but if you were to tip me, how much do you want to give me?\" I wanted to not tip him all together, but my fiancee decided to tip him $6, which he clearly did not deserve.I understand it was late and we were probably the last delivery of the night, but come on. That was just lazy and so incredibly unprofessional. The pizza itself was delicious, hence the two starts, but I would rather order from a different location to assure I don't have to deal with that particular driver again."}
{"text":"Like many others I wish there was a way to give this particular location zero stars. We moved in Scottsdale a bit over a year ago, we're long time Papa John's lovers, well ... not anymore, this location just about did everything that can ever go wrong, from uncooked ingredients over pure raw dough, to never cutting pizza Chicago style to delivery an hour later NOT because of the driver but because supposedly the system and the manager refuses to fix the problem that supposedly cuts our apt # of the delivery information. Thank you papa johns for the long time relationship but unfortunately even if we got a year long supply of free pizza from this location it just won't do it anymore!!!"}
{"text":"I have always ordered from this papa johns location, recently though I have not been happy with the pizza. The dough and cheese does not seem cooked enough, very greasy now. This last pizza I ordered actually made me sick the next day. It seems they don't check the quality of the pizza before they box it up. Cmon papa johns.."}
{"text":"I order here a lot. Pizza is always on point. Love the new pan. In my opinion, it is better than dominos' pan. Keep up the good work - Tony Mozzarella"}
{"text":"This really is the worst location you could ever order from! I've finally stopped giving them a chance after tonight. They've never delivered our order within the time frame they've stayed in email or over the phone. It should not take an hour and a half to receive a single pizza! Not only does it take forever and a day to receive the order, but it also arrives at room temperature. Never again."}
{"text":"Pizza crust was so burnt that we couldn't even eat it. I know that its not supposed to be great pizza but come on. I posted photos so I hope the management team can see what a bad experience it was for my daughter and I."}
{"text":"I give this location zero stars, for the total lack of convenience! My husband ordered and paid for our pizza online. Now, tell me why, when I went to pick it up, the dippity-do-da idiot wouldn't let me pick it up? My husband had to show them the credit card and license. What if he was invalid and couldn't get out of bed, what then? Never going there again!"}
{"text":"Delivered wrong pizza. On complaining they tell me that they have added a free pizza on my account. I call hem the next day to claim the free pizza and they tell me there is no free pizza on my account! Will never recommend this place. Dominos near the university provides way better service."}
{"text":"First time ordering from this location and very disappointed. When I placed the order online, I was quoted 30-40 minutes, order showed up 5 mins shy of an hour. By the time it was delivered, pizza and cheese sticks were cold. I won't be ordering from here again."}
{"text":"My family has ordered pizza from this location for almost 5 years. We do a lot of carry-out and not much delivery. I've ordered over the phone and thru the App. We have had very few and minor mistakes by this location."}
{"text":"YIKES!  I just read the other reviews for this place and they sound terrifying!!!!  I fortunatly have not had those issues.  The pizza it okay.  It's nothing spectacular and I would say it's a step above frozen pizza.  Since I'm a student at CSN, I get 50% off.  I've been here twice and done take out both times and I haven't had any issues."}
{"text":"Quick with delivery and never mess up my order - great deals if you use the app"}
{"text":"This is not the first time (but it's certainly the last) that I ordered two 14\" pizzas! Clearly they are NOT 14\" pizzas!!! Last time they said, \"Oh will send you coupons for a free pizza...\" ya, never got anything. Rip off!!!"}
{"text":"HIGH DELIVERY FEE = $3.50  Pizza - always good.  Service - always good.   But I just won't be ordering any longer due to the HIGH DELIVERY FEE = $3.50!  Order a pizza for $12.00 and then pay almost 30% for a delivery fee which is nothing more than additional revenue for the store - it does not go to the driver (as noted on the site).  If I'm not mistaken, this fee was $2.75 just a month ago which was still outrageous (Domino's is still $2.75).  I know all pizza delivery company's charge a delivery fee but not sure they are as high as Papa John's.  So you order a $12.00 pizza and it winds up costing you around $19.50 after the $3.50 delivery fee, $1.00 in tax and a tip to the driver of $3.00.  Instead of raising prices on the pizza, the 'trick' of even having and then increasing the delivery fee is used.  PJ should be the leader and eliminate the delivery fee at all locations!"}
{"text":"Fantastic! I ordered 2 pizzas from them tonight, on a friday, they gave me an eta of 30 min. I called at 30 min and they said they didn't have any record of my order. They said give them 25 min max and it would be there fresh. I said ok. As soon as I hung up the phone, there was a knock at my door. It was the delivery guy with my pizza. I quickly called papa johns back and they said thank you for letting us know. The pizza was delicious as always. After we finished eating there was another knock at my door. It was the pizza guy with my order again. I told him the situation. He said he was aware and that this round was on the house. I graciously accepted and thanked him again. In summery, best chain pizza place with customer service bar none. Definitely recommended!!!"}
{"text":"Ordered a philly cheese steak pizza from here 3 days ago. That night I woke up having to go. I had gotten bad diarrhea. Ever  since I ate that pizza i have been waking up every, night dry heaving and feeling horribly sick. I have no appetite whatsoever and feel really weak. And when I think of the pizza I start feeling worse. What did you guys feed me? Rotten beef?? Stay away if you don't want food poisoning."}
{"text":"Thought I would give Papa Johns another chance, since last time was so bad. If you want a good pizza or plan to order for  a superbowl party. This is not the place to order. Crust is always chewy, toppings are non existent as well as sauce. They need to spend more money on making good pizzas instead paying for top athletes in their commercials. I won't waste my money or palette on this pizza. Terrible pizza!!"}
{"text":"The auto-generated email saying that the owner would contact me was a complete lie. No call. No email. No anything. Well, it's cool... There are other choices out there."}
{"text":"Very rarely get my order messed up, has happened before but as long as you check your pizzas before you leave you'll have no issues.  Whether ordering online or by phone the service is usually friendly and nice. I don't order delivery normally so I can't review that side of the business but I always see a lot of delivery vehicles."}
{"text":"Got a one of their new brownies and there was hair baked all in the brownies didn't notice it until after midnight and they had already closed. Called them back today only to be told there was nothing they would do about it....."}
{"text":"Staff is extremely rude and pizza was extremely greasy. Returned my food for a refund. Will never come back to this location."}
{"text":"My last delivery order was not good and I was told by the manager that he would put 2 X-Large pizzas on my account. I spoke w/ Randy ( different manager) tonight and his professionalism, courtesy and genuine kindness really made an impression on me. Thank you, Randy!"}
{"text":"Horrible customer service.  $6.99 large pizza deal was going on and they were visibly overwhelmed.  Someone making the pizzas was cursing and yelling at other employees. Don't waste your time here."}
{"text":"I ordered on a Friday evening around 7:30ish.  I was prepared to wait.  I used the app and selected a saved location that puts this store as the delivery store.   Apparently whoever got the order at this store must have read the billing address and not the delivery address, because they transferred the order to a store near my house.  When I got the call from the new store I figured the original store must have been slammed.  And I was ok with this. I order from the store at 91st and olive all the time and have never had an issue.  Also, the distance isn't all that different so I figured the areas may overlap a bit, especially in busy situations.  About 20 mins after the new store called me, someone from my house calls me asking if I ordered pizza.  They delivered it to my house and not my current location!  And yes I know what all you instant problem solvers are thinking, my location on my phone was ON, and I doubled checked the delivery address.  I even have the confirmation email.  Luckily,  the team at the 91st Ave and olive store has their shit together and was able to bring my order to me."}
{"text":"I order here all the time. The wait time they email you, between 30-40 mins is the time they arrive. The delivery guys are nice. I usual just order pizza, did have the brownie once, it was a little burnt. ....the pic with raw dough was on March 6, 2018...I didn't notice till the next that the dough was raw underneath the toppings. Out of all the times I had a delivery, only once I had uncooked dough."}
{"text":"I was really disappointed with what I received today. Paid a $3.50 delivery fee + tip and got a horrible cold pizza! Wish I had the option of removing delicery fee and tip! No no no!"}
{"text":"After working a monster shift the last thing I wanted to do was cook on a hot and humid night. So I figured I would order pizza, leave to pick up my son at summer camp and be back in time to get my hot and fresh pizza.  First off health score was 91.0  Second the girls who were \"working\" were too busy adjusting their QT icee orders to even greet me.   Third when I asked what the specials were I was told I could get 2 large pizzas for $20. Looks, my son and I don't even need a large pizza to share, let alone two. For $20 I could take him out to eat and still have money left over. Besides $10 for a large cheese pizza (all my 7 yr old likes) is too much. Ugh!  So I left the hot and humid icky building.   There are waaaaay too many pizza chains in Sun Valley to be treated this way."}
{"text":"Never had a bad experience here. The other night 8/9/14 we ordered from them, my daughter really likes their specialty cheese pizza, and we tried the limited time special pulled pork pizza with pepper jack cheese and bbq sauce, it was all really good. Oh and we ordered one of the cookies also, the kids thought the giant cookie pie was amazing!  I like being able to order online. It makes the whole experience smoother, there are no misunderstandings as to what may have been said and no hold times.   They are the only place in my area that delivers to my house, so I can appreciate that but they are also always nice when you go in to pick up as well!  Just a cool location all around."}
{"text":"Tried to get a pizza delivered to my aunt, but they wouldn't process the order even though I wanted to pay the tip before hand. They were extremely rude and not accommodating at all. Even refused to put the pepperoni in the shape of a heart. Called pizza hut instead. They were nice."}

{"text":"I represent a local youth group.  A few weeks ago manager Tyler agreed to donate 4 pizza for one of our events. This last weekend I called back the day before to make the order, as Tyler had instructed.  General Manager Chris stated that Tyler should not have made this offer to us and refused to honor our agreement.  I recommend you spend your money at a business that communicates better amongst its management team about the support they offer to the local community.  We were fortunate enough that Mr Jim's Pizza (702-727-8388) was able to step in and give us outstanding support!"}
{"text":"Better as a pizza option rather than dominos pizza hut and others alike. Love the touch of fresh jalapeño with every pizza"}
{"text":"We generally like Papa John's pizza but this location is terrible. The customer service is poor, incompetent delivery drivers and they are so very slow.  With Donatos and some other more reliable options in the area - I recommend ordering from there until this place gets new management or their act turned around."}
{"text":"Good, cheap Pizza. To me, way better than Dominos.  If you make a online profile, you get promotions every week, and  they are all great promotions ($5 for a two toppings medium pizza, $10 for a large specialty or five topping... things like that), such that paying the regular price sounds almost a dumb thing to do (to be honest, if I had to pay the regular price, I probably wouldn't eat here).  I live right next to their store, so I always order to pickup, and my orders were never late (they say between 15 and 25 minutes, I always go by the 15th minute and the Pizza is always ready).  The best pizza I've had in Champaign is Papa Dels, by far, but to the everyday-pizza, Papa Johns is my personal favorite, no complaints whatsoever."}
{"text":"Terrible pizza. It was as hard as a piece of cardboard. Just terrible. I specifically asked for well done chicken wings, they were raw and gross. They dumped bar be que sauce on top. Messy.  Gooey.  Raw.  This restaurant has done nothing but gone downhill. We all hated it.  I am positive the wing request was totally ignored, double cook please ! The over done pizza was inedible. Avoid this place."}
{"text":"We have been ordering from our local Papa John's, every Friday, for just about 4 yrs straight. It has been nothing but amazing service.  The orders are almost always perfect (\"sometimes\" there appears to be less sauce, but that's my opinion...lol), and any issues we have, they correct within a few min. The drivers take there time to go back and bring anything that may have been missed, even after hours. This local store is the best (especially the drivers)."}
{"text":"Ordered pick up from this location and arrived about 10 minutes later, they had not even started to make order yet they told me on phone it would take 15 minutes to be ready.    Liars, blamed a rush even though there was 5 people joking around in store. Avoid this location.   What a joke"}
{"text":"The pizza is good. The two previous times I have ordered from this location I bought an extra garlic sauce. And neither time was it included, even though the delivery lady said - your extra garlic sauce is in the box. I called after the 2nd time and the manager apologized and said next time I ordered to call the store and they will send a few garlic sauces free of charge. Awesome! I'm ok with that, your pizzas good I don't want to write a bad review, it's a win win.. I called today and explained the situation and they said they would send 4 cups. The pizza arrived, and there was one cup in each box. Is it petty to be done with this location over 1.00? Yes. But I'm paying for food I want, and you aren't delivering. Even after I gave you a 2nd chance."}
{"text":"If I could give 0 stars I would. Worst experience I've ever had with any pizza company! Online website doesn't work. You call the store they say they can't help you with online order.  You then call the 800 number and they fix one issue only to have another problem pop up on the next page even though they said they fixed all of the issues. I will never order from this company ever again. Worst customer service!!"}
{"text":"Barely any toppings on my pizza not worth my money. I do love papa john's but this particular location is well I don't want to say not good but it's just ok acceptable"}
{"text":"I normally order my pizza but today I decided to pickup myself.  I will never order pizza from this place again!  Place is dirty and flies everywhere , must have a fly hive inside papa johns. The guy at the register was horrible. My pizza sat there for 15min before he realized it was mine and doing nothing but complaining about how busy they are. I wanted to walk out but unfortunately I had already paid. Then he showed me the pizza , that thing was so greasy it looked more like Mexican pizza. What happen to fresh ingredients.  I didn't even care anymore, just wanted to get somewhere safe."}
{"text":"The first and last time I order pizza from these clowns again!!! Order took 40 mins more than stated and when the illegal alien showed up,it looked as if someone sat on the box of pizza. Needless to say it was all  F'd up!! Smashed!! Wtf?? I had to scrape toppings off the box!  I can't express this enough! DO NOT ORDER PIZZA FROM THIS PLACE!!  You've been warned."}
{"text":"This place is a joke. Called was put on hold no one came back called again asking for the buy one get one deal that's advertised as the first special on their website and they have never heard of it and neither has their manager. All the lady could say is sorry we don't know what your talking about and not even try to see what I'm seeing on their website ended up saying forget it and she happily said ok lol waste of business space."}
{"text":"My favorite pizza place. Always delicious, always quick! I go so often I know most the staff. The app is great and has the best benefits, if you make 25 purchases your 26th is free!"}
{"text":"Manager told me he was \"Seeing a pattern\" in my ordering pizzas because they have forgotten cheese sauce when delivering pizzas. Once because I ordered a thin crust and they don't sent sauces with thin crust and again when I ordered pizza for myself and three others and they heard me ask for one garlic sauce and two cheese sauces.  I worked for papa johns. This is the GENERAL MANAGER talking me a former employee and customer like this! Never ordering from this store again. I will drive to Val Vista and elliot to pick up my pizzas. I highly suggest others do the same."}
{"text":"Please keep the cheeseburger pizza this time.  I hate it when you keep getting rid of the pizza i love most.  Be nice, please, and keep it on the menu this time. The commercials never say, limited time only, so we get very upset when we cant get what we want."}
{"text":"Today we moved into our new house and it took us all day since we were moving with friends and children. So I called Papa Johns to order pizza. And so the drama begins...Jake the manager at this location is as arrogant and unapologetic as they come!  We ordered our food online, and received the email confirmation at 9:18pm. Jake calls us back less than 5 minutes later and says they are \"out of cinnamon pull aparts\" so he offered a cookie or brownie. We chose the cookie!  Jake calls back at 9:42pm to tell me that we are out of their delivery range! What?! I tell him that's not possible the app would not choose the wrong store would it? So he proceeds to tell me I have to call another store to place my order. He tells me I'm closer to Chandler Heights and Alma School and I tell him he is wrong. I thought to myself I'm going to look at the map sure enough Jake is incorrect. I call back and the person that answered the phone takes my phone # and immediately says I'm out of their delivery range without asking to confirm my address. I asked to speak to the manager- guess who it is - Jake. He gives me the # to the other location and says nothing he can do I'm a real snotty way! I call the other location, Nick answers and he is sooo helpful. I explained the situation and my disdain for the other papa Johns location and he says let me check the map. He comes back and guess what he says - u guessed it - I need to call the other location. So I ask to speak to a manager.  By now it's after 10pm! Hungry kids and people! Now, Nick gets on and I explain once again and he apologizes, says he will call the other location and figure out what is going on.  10 min later, guess who called - u guessed it Jake! (With egg on his face and still arrogant) He proceeds to tell me that I entered the wrong address and that's why he kept telling me to call the other store! Wrong answer! Why would the app send me to his store if I had input the wrong address??! I stated to him again that I have given him my address 3x and he is not listening. He then asked for my address again! He then says \"we are going to get this to you free of charge and it should 35 min.\"  He never apologized for getting things wrong or the time we had to wait thru his incompetence and arrogance! Needless to say I have never experienced this from any other Papa Johns and I hope he gets reprimanded even though he is a so called \"manager!\" Btw my food was delivered at 10:54pm. I sincerely I hope I have no more brushes with Jake and that he humbles himself."}
{"text":"This place is worst. I have ordered delivery twice and no one showed. Good pizza most likely with horrible service."}
{"text":"Let me start by saying if I could give them negative stars I would. Anytime I come to Vegas I order from papa Johns and I always mess up by giving into my love of pjs and ordering from this location. The first time I waited for about 3 hours and they said it would be 45 min. They were \"short staffed\". The second time I waited an hour and called to see where my pizza was and they said it was sent out. Waited another hour canceled my order had to pull teeth to get them to refund my credit card. And the guy i spoke to was probably the biggest jerk I have ever spoken to. He actually hung up on me and I called back. I then went out to eat then came home and relaxed only to find my pizza has arrived 4 hours from when I called and  2 hours after I canceled. And today they messed up my whole order but got the Pepsi right and were on time. Haha. Don't order from here. The staff sucks. Call the other location. Usually they will deliver if you explain how terrible this location is."}
{"text":"On 1/5/17, I ordered two pizzas to be delivered to my place of work. My order was placed at 6:55 pm and I was given a 30-40 minute wait time. Our driver showed up within the 30-40 minutes, shoved the pizzas into one of my employee's hands while she was with one of our own customers, and walked out the door. She described the driver (who I believe is named Rod or Rob) as \"completely rude\". Not only did we receive terrible service, but the pizzas were cold, dry, and inedible (very chewy/rubbery and gross).  This employee called the restaurant to complain on our behalf and spoke to a manager named Kim, who was equally as rude. She was told two new pizzas would be sent out to replace the original ones we ordered. This is now at about 7:40-50ish pm. At about 8:20-30ish pm I called the restaurant once again, voicing concern that our place of business closes at 9:00 pm and we were still waiting on our pizzas to be redelivered. I also spoke to Kim and can confirm that she was utterly rude. She barely let me finish a sentence, talking over me the whole time, and told me that \"your pizzas are still coming, you're at the end of the queuing line for re-delivery\". So we have dealt with two rude employees, one a manager, were served disgusting food, and are then told that we're last in line to be taken care of. As someone who works in customer service, I can't begin to explain how wrong that is. At the end of the conversation she told me our pizzas were leaving the building at that point (8:20-30ish pm) and they didn't get redelivered until AFTER WE CLOSED (and they tasted no better). Getting two pizzas delivered was a 2+ hour fiasco!  Not only was the service and food shockingly terrible, but my employees and I didn't get to eat, which was obviously the entire point of ordering the pizza to begin with. I make minimum wage. I can't necessarily \"afford\" to spend $20+ to feed my staff, but this was a special occasion and I wanted to treat them. I don't feel that what we received was worth any amount of money, let alone $20 (plus, I pre-tipped the driver... lesson learned there). I've been a customer of Papa John's for years and ordering it is always a treat, and I don't recall any other time ever receiving customer service/food like this. However, this has altered my view of the company and I will definitely be using a different company in the future, especially for work functions."}
{"text":"Adriana the manager is hella dope. Honored the credit i was given over the driver getting into an car accident in fron of my complex and my order not getting placed. She is really dope in my book and deserves a couple days of PTO. Lol"}
{"text":"Ordered my usual today.  9/10 times I pay and tip w cash for the sake of the driver. I obviously order often from here because of the pizza, price and garlic sauce! I've noticed the drivers are always kind people. I'm not quite sure the hiring process. But my dad was a pizza delivery guy believe it or not. He was much more of a \"shmoozer\" for extra tips.  Today I wanted to write a great review for each of the delivery drivers I got to meet since I've been a customer. Steve, the standout delivery driver from earlier this afternoon, made me want to post a review for all the delivery drivers at Papa John's in my area. They are all worth a minute of our time! Thank you, Steve!!"}
{"text":"Ok, I knew I wasn't going for an authentic Italian pizza that would rate 5 stars, but I have to say, I was unpleasantly surprised what I got... the pizza was ready on time, it was hot, the person at the counter at pickup was friendly, but the pizza was truly tasteless.  Perhaps it was my toppings, extra cheese, and beef or meatballs or whatever it's called.  From the first slice, I really didn't want to finish it, it was a chore that I finally just gave up on...will not be ordering from PJ again."}
{"text":"The worst Papa Johns of all. Employees are total airheads. Will not answer your call to place an order and if they do answer you are put on hold. I held for 20 minutes and never got to place an order. Never again"}
{"text":"It's Papa John's...what can I say.  It's not great, but not bad for fast pizza.  Even though it's not great, at least you know what you're getting every time."}
{"text":"Ordered on Grubhub. Pizza never even came. I've for 2 hours when the expected time was 45 minutes. Do not go to this location."}
{"text":"I found a screw baked into my pizza!! Yes, you read that right... a screw. When I called they refunded me my money but it sounded like a \"chore\" for them to help me. I immediately checked my account and I saw not one but TWO debits out of my account for the same amount and only one credit. Of course I called back again and instead of resolving the issue for me they told me to call back in a few days when the refund settles. I cannot understand why I would have two charges for the same amount or an f-ing screw in my pizza I almost chipped my tooth on. WTF!!!!!"}
{"text":"Darren's a dootiehead again. I found nothing wrong with their pizza or wings."}
{"text":"Ordered online for delivery this weekend and it was great! The cheese sticks and pan crust custom veggie pizza was yummilicious! I could track my order easily online, and delivery was prompt. I asked for Italian seasoning as a special delivery instructions, and it was delivered. I've stayed at different cities in the USA and ordered from multiple stores. This is one of the best food and service I've got at Papa Johns!"}
{"text":"I had a very pleasant experience at this Papa John's! I made an online order for carry out. Our order was made quickly. I drove home for 15 minutes and the crust was still crispy. The sauce was perfect and best of all, the pizza was not greasy. The employees there were very kind as well!"}
{"text":"While I usually have no issues with the quality of the food I get when ordering, and super fast delivery, the prices have skyrocketed in the past few months.  Delivery fee has gone up 1.50, sides and wings have also gone up by 2$.  I find it difficult to keep ordering from Papa Johns as they are much more expensive than any other pizza delivery joint in the area.  While the quality is a bit better, I can almost go out to Oregenos for the same price now."}

Unfortunately I find that whether I do carry out OR delivery, I end up having to reach deep into that reserve of patience that most keep around for times such as these.   This is a fairly new store & maybe they have an all new crew & just need to find their grove, I don't know. I'm gonna give them the benefit of the doubt for a while longer :)"}
{"text":"I would have given a zero star if I could. Ordered an xl 5 topping pizza online. Two of the toppings were grilled chicken and the others are pineapple, onion n bell pepper. What we got was like a round piece of pizza crust decorated here and there with pineapple and bell peppers. Hardly saw pieces of chicken in a double chicken topped pizza. This is our second experience. Never ever going to order a pizza from papa johns again."}
{"text":"The first time I ordered, there were no real problems, other than an extended wait, 30-40 minute delivery time was the estimate and it took about 50 minutes.  Not the end of the world.  Second time didn't go too well at all.  Ordered a pizza at 12:00 p.m. and was given an estimated wait of 30-40 minutes again.  At 1:08 I called because the pizza had still not arrived.  I was told that the delivery guy was walking out the door and there was an included coupon for a free large pizza next time.  Compensation made me feel better. About 1:30 p.m. delivery guy comes with pizza.    Third time around - taking down to 2 stars from 3.  Promised delivery time of 11:45.  Pizza delivered at 1:10 p.m. - COLD.  Had to call to find out where pizza deliver was at 12:15 and was told that they had 1 driver and a lot of orders so my order would be at least another 30 minutes, but they would refund my pizza charge.  Another 55 minutes later my pizza arrives, but is completely cold.  I think it was made at the promised time but not delivered for another hour and 25 minutes.   Overall: C- One decent order, two bad orders - hopefully I'll be able to give an updated review as we use them more!"}
{"text":"I originally stayed away from this Papa Johns because of the reviews. This time I just wasn't in the mood to drive 15 min to go get pizza and 15 min back and eat it cold again so we tried it. The customer service was excellent and the food was really good too. I don't know maybe I was just really hungry but it was the best  Papa John's I have ever had! The ceiling was pretty cool too lol just to add that in... sometimes it's the small details that count haha but we will definitely be using this location again!"}
{"text":"This was one of the worst experiences I've had with a Papa John's delivery driver. All of my orders were also made incorrectly. They have decent coupons, but why bother using them when the service is going to be a nightmare? Not returning."}
{"text":"We have been regular customers at this location for over 8 years. The pizza is ok, the service isn't the best, but we don't expect a lot from a chain, BUT this last experience was UNACCEPTABLE! So, bought pizza Sunday via online, the girl helping us clearly had no idea what she was doing. It took her several minutes to even just spot our pizza that she looked right at several times. We sign our receipt for $11.91 & go on our way. Well, fast forward today, I was checking our online banking & notice they charged us $15. I call the store. John tries telling me my total was $15. I explain I have my emailed receipt that states $11.91. He then takes a few minutes & says \"your total was $11.91 but you left a $3.09 tip\". I then reply \"I did NOT leave a $3.09 or any tip at all for a pizza that I picked up!\" They have an employee or employees that are changing receipts & OVERCHARGING CUSTOMERS! We're so disgusted & WILL NOT go to this store EVER AGAIN! BUYERS BEWARE"}

However, the Pizza is good only about 60% of the time.  3 out of the 5 orders we've placed were decent.  The other 2 times the Pizza wasn't as fresh.  Another time they forgot our dipping sauces.

I've done it before 100's of times....but it has been several years since the last time I ordered from PJ's online.  I ordered a large Sausage & Pepperoni Pizza.  The Pizza was delivered in a timely manner....however, after the guy left and I opened the box in the kitchen, I saw that it was only a CHEESE Pizza!

NO.....how about a replacement Pizza?  NO....what the hell?  I was starving, so I begrudgingly ate the Cheese Pizza....and you know, it tasted \"bitter\".....

{"text":"When I was in the states I tried Papa Johns and was immediately impressed. Upon returning to the motherland here in Canada I was disappointed to discover Papa was only hanging around America, and there were none here. That all changed a few years back when the franchise started making moves into Toronto, and no one was more stoked about this than I (After all, Peyton Manning wouldn't be the spokesperson for just ANY pizza joint!)  After all of this though, I'll have to admit, the first time I had Papa Johns here in Toronto I was....underwhelmed a bit. It was good, but not great. Felt like the type of pizza that immediately out of the oven would be great but cooled quickly. My feelings towards the pizza did too.  The second time it was better, and I enjoyed the pizza although the flavoring in their sausage has this very rosemary'ish tinge which I'm not so sure I'm that crazy about. I was neutral on them still.   But the third time (these orders were a fair amount of time apart as due to expanding waistlines I try not to order pizza for deli every too often) it was freaking AMAZING!!! I think there must be a secret Papa Johns pizza oven hiding somewhere in my hallway that I was unaware of, because this pizza couldn't have been out of the oven for more than 30 seconds when I got it. Piping hot and lots of gooey cheese, this was the way that Papa intended things to be!!!  At this point, they're batting .333, which is hall of fame worthy. For that reason and the extreme cheesiness of this last order, I'd say it's worth the trip!"}

She finally got it and said I was going to receive my soda .. so I waited and 30 min passed my pizza was cold at this time then I called the manager answered the phone and she was like I'm sorry no one put this order for you I was pissed off by this time don't get me wrong she was good but everyone else was bad.then she was like I'm so sorry but she didn't have a driver available to bring my soda so I drove there oh and the African American chick said that she didn't have cherry Pepsi but when. I got there I had got my cherry pepsi. I am very upset since 1. My pizza got cold and 2 we ended up eating cold pizza with water since we didn't have our soda. 3 the attitudes that were given to me 4 the false info    The black girl never mentioned anything to anyone about my account so not good.it will be a while before I even come to your store again..."}
{"text":"So, I know I'm supposed to love Z Pizza, but I really don't. It is pricey, and just not that great. The other day I was craving a solid veggie slice. My vegan friend had recently told me a story about how she can easily eat at Papa John's because the crust & garlic sauce are standard vegan. I popped on to the website and there seems to be a Monday deal for any of the speciality pizzas. I decided to take the plunge.  When I arrived, unfortunately my called in order didn't appear to be the system. The cashier was kind about it, and said that it'd be 10 minutes to make my pizza. It wasn't an ideal situation, but, what is 10 minutes in the scheme of things?  It was out in 10 minutes and one of the guys inside was kind enough to bring it to me while I was in my car (being one of those obnoxious people stuck to their smartphone). And, you know, for the cost, it was pretty tasty. That garlic sauce is da bomb (and mildly addictive). If I'm craving a cheap, quick pie, I will definitely call up Papa John's."}
{"text":"Papa John's pizza, haven't had it in years, since they skiddaddled out of Lorain. It's a really good pizza. One thing is for sure, Papa John's is consistent. It's just as good as we had it, 10 yrs ago!  The employees at this location are extremely nice! Hope Papa John's corporation gives these people what they're worth. All it takes is one unkind employee to turn a customer around & go elsewhere. This goes for ANY place of business! Kudos to employees at this Papa John's location.  #satisfiedcustomer"}
{"text":"I always have a good experience here. Staff is super friendly. Had an experience with Shannon today. He went out of his way to assist me. I'm a bit crippled and he didn't have to do that."}
{"text":"This store has plummeted in customer service in the last 8 months. Never had problems before. Now consistently I have issues with food not ready, waiting 1/2 hour longer than what time I was quoted or wrong size from what I ordered and paid for. Other customers around me being told their orders are lost. Store is complete chaos!"}

{"text":"I ordered my pizza for the first time using Papa John's app from my iPhone 4. I picked out a pizza from their current deal and added all the toppings I wanted. I clicked order now and I was done in no time :)   I got an email conformation saying it will be ready in fifteen minutes. So I drove to the location since it's only couple of minutes away. I walked right in to pick up my pizza once I was done with the payment.   I picked out the extra red pepper and cheese pouches from the corner than I was back home enjoying delicious PJ Pizza in few mins."}
{"text":"As far as pizza goes this is the most underwhelming I've had in a long time. I ordered online which was ok, it arrived fairly quickly but that was the only redeeming quality. The pizza itself was very bland. Wishing we had gone with one of the local places that might take a bit longer or with another major chain that would have had more flavor than Papas did."}
{"text":"DO NOT GO TO THIS PJ's!!! They are crooks!  The fool (Herbert) that took my call is just something else. I spell my name, say my phone number... And he still manages to get it wrong.   The CROOK part is that I ordered a large Pepperoni pizza and the total game out to $17.03... I look at their board and I see I can get a specialty pizza with multiple toppings for cheaper. I was in a rush so I just paid and was going to figure it out when I get home.   Now I'm looking at the labels on the box... THEY CHARGED ME EXTRA PEPPERONI AND EXTRA GARLIC!   Pizza quality: terrible. The slices are uneven, the toppings are uneven (some areas are thicker with cheese than others) and omg the crust ughhhh   Never coming back here nor will I ever recommend this place  P.S. It is true that when you call, all they do is put you on hold and make you wait."}
{"text":"I called to place an order for a pepperoni & sausage pizza. I was told \"we don't have that.\"  I asked how that is possible & I was told they only have that kind of pizza if ordered on-line & not over the phone. Seriously? Like a sucker I went on-line & ordered the pizza. When it arrived, the crust was quite doughy & extremely soggy & undercooked! Yuck, yuck & yuck! I will not be returning. Save your money!"}
{"text":"Awesome and quick delivery. Used them for years and cant recall EVER having any issues.  Traffic may suck for pickup because its right across from glendale community college and next door to a overcrowded and run down circle k. Opt for the delivery if u can. Worth it n quick!"}
{"text":"Maybe someone sees this but I doubt it. We specifically ask for pizzas a certain way every time that is ordered from the app. The mistake occurs when the ticket is not read, time in and time out. Once the pizza comes to my house incorrectly, I have to call and ask them to remake it and then get put last in line for delivery. Mistakes should be taken care of right away. Please read the tickets before it is made. Again, please read the tickets before the pizza is made."}
{"text":"My pizza is always delicious small or large, cheap or free.  I usually order by app and it's ready upon arrival.  I wish it was at a better location due to construction on independence makes it an annoyance to get over there without traffic or going down to idle wild to make U-turn."}
{"text":"I have been meaning to stop by Domino's to buy some pizza for quite some time now and instead always end up here at the numerologically significant address of 4444 W. Craig Road.   It must be the generally more customer-friendly pricing and the many specials and offers that Papa John's has available throughout the year that make this my personal favorite place for a quick pizza fix. I'll take a large pizza with the works most any time.  Join  Papa John's email list online and you will on a weekly basis start receiving a steady stream of two-for-one and 50% off offers in your inbox to satisfy the pizza monster that lurks within."}
{"text":"This was my first time here and Will not be ordering from papa John's again, I ordered a pizza at 1230 I'm still waiting don't order from here.."}
{"text":"They don't even deserve a star. They don't do any discounts for large orders and if your looking for order to be wrong and they having to wait an 1 hour for them to fix it, then this is the place for you. The phone staff is extremely rude and unhelpful. We will NEVER order them again."}
{"text":"I wish I'd checked the reviews before deciding to order. Holy cow, was this awful! I ordered 2 medium pizzas, one pepperoni and half pineapple with light cheese and extra sauce, the other pepperoni and sausage with extra sauce. There was some sauce but not even to a degree I would consider \"normal\" let alone extra. Pizza wasn't cold but it wasn't hot. Received in about 45 minutes, which is twice as long as Domino's usually takes. They also called to ask my gate code, which i had provided online when I ordered (but appears they didn't print on the receipt for their driver). Guess I'll be sticking with Dominos - at least they seem like they give a damn."}
{"text":"I've had Papa John's before and this location wasn't that great and I ordered it with extra cheese.... and it didn't seem like it had hardly any extra cheese.  The Pizza wasn't cooked enough making it soggy flabby pizza.  The also need to cut their pieces better because I ordered it small cuts and it was a mess.  The only thing that tasted good was the crust and pepperoni.  Sadly I'm glad My pizza was free from the super bowl....otherwise I'd never order from Papa John's.  Their sauce is also not very good....  For 10 or 11 bucks I'd expect more..... if I had to pay for what I got."}
{"text":"The employees here are super nice and super understanding but the bald GM dude or whoever he was needs a serious attitude check. He seriously thought it was okay to back talk and give sass. Keep your snarky little comments to yourself dude! Next time I'll be calling your district manager or the HQ"}
{"text":"like this place because they always hook it up even when Domino's doesn't. Papa Johns staff is nice and smart to everyone!"}
{"text":"One star for the driver.  She is competent and friendly.  XL Pizza?  NOT!!  A few ingredients.  Nothing like what is shown on the commercial and what they brag about on the commercial.The taste of sauce was the only thing that came across.  Never again."}
{"text":"After being a customer here a few years I am compelled to stop and warn others. If like me you get pizza delivery when you have too many things going on for time to cook and you want quality pizza that looks like the advertisements, this location is not for you! Semi-burnt greasy flat pizza crusts are one thing. But the never ever putting a nacho cheese sauce in the boxes when requested is just too much. I'm paying for it. Its included in the cost right? I've seen the cheese sauce order printed on the receipt but never in the boxes. And when I call to ask if they can swing those by on the next run or credit me, I get a \"STFU\" type attitude. That was the prior time. Tonight, still no sauce. So after some years of this, I'm ending my relationship with this location, and I advise you to pick another place."}
{"text":"this place is terrible. Their food is decent but their service is the absolute worst. I always order a large pizza, extra garlic sauce, and garlic parmesan cheese breadsticks. I recently purchased a high school discount card from a football player.  It gives a papa johns code for pick up and also carryout.  I called to try and use it.  The girl on the phone...I believe her name to be Laurna  or something to that extent was extremely rude.  She completely dismissed it.  I told her I was holding it in my hand and she said I'd have to come in to use it.. ok I'm down the street... oh...but we're closed right now... I can order over the phone and have it delivered... but they wouldn't accept my coupon...because they were closed... uh ok... so after she hung up on me and then hung up on my brother in law.. we ordered pizza hut.  So tonight we decide we're going to try this valid coupon again...it doesn't expire until JUNE 2017... they were rude on the phone yet again and wouldn't let us over... I'm over this place.  never will eat at this location again."}
{"text":"In addition to the wildly inaccurate and inconsistent estimated delivery times that I mentioned in my original review, on our last two orders, there were no sauces included. Not a single one! Lack of garlic dipping sauce (especially when I made sure to mention it specifically) makes for a sad Katie and coworkers when all we wanted was to split some cheesesticks. Fortunately some of our other coworkers took pity and let us trade some bland cheesesticks for some of their pizza, but that is no redemption for this Papa John's franchise.  Don't know if it's just lack of care by the people running this operation or something more sinister, but this Papa John's has moved from 'avoid if possible' status to 'absolutely do not patronize'."}
{"text":"Usually order from Pizza Hut but had a coupon. It was pretty dang good! I was surprised and impressed!!!!"}
{"text":"Bad service.   I have no intentions of critiquing the shitty food -- it is the same everywhere -- but, this location consistently has poor service, and thus, my review.   I complete my online order at 8:44PM and it is not until 9:55PM when my doorbell is rung. A ready time of thirty minutes my ass.   No, this is not during a holiday, or the Big Game (AFL Super Bowl), or Ramadan. And, I do not live in a cabin high up on Mount Snow.   I think if they are charging 15% delivery fee, on top of the tip I am going to inevitably hand the driver, they should make the food and deliver it in a timely fucking manner. But, maybe I am asking for too much.   Papa John: get your shit together, hoss."}
{"text":"Trust me when I say that I will NEVER, EVER order anything from Papa John's again. If I wanted garbage \"food\" I would have gone over to the closest trash dumpster and picked thru the bones and the cock roaches for something edible. Not only is this the worst \"pizza\" I've ever had but easily the worst meal I've ever seen. How badly someone can screw up an order like this is beyond me. Maybe if you morons would use real ovens instead of that blast furnace conveyor belt, and hired people who can do the job, you MIGHT have a shot at making something decent. You make me sick. I want to hurl right now."}
{"text":"I want to start off saying pizza is so yummy. When I call on the phone. Very attentive! But I went to pick up the pizza. I didn't feel a warm welcome. And I even tip.i will try to go again. Because pizza was delicious. But I dont feel that warm welcome. I will not go back"}
{"text":"Also found out that the day I ordered my pizza ( Tuesday ) they have buy one get one free pizza if you buy a large or Xlarge...but because I did not specifically ask for it, they did not offer it. This is bad business folks..another reason I will not order from them again :("}
{"text":"Saw a guy smoking in the car while delivering pizza in my neighborhood. Called and spoke to a manager, who says this is ok and that ALL delivery drivers are allowed to smoke.   I respect the fact that people have the right to smoke, just not in a car while delivering food..GROSS!!"}
{"text":"If I could give this place a negative 2, I would.  I ordered on line because we were starving one night and it was one of the only places open.  First, their idea of a large pizza is small compared to normal pizza places.   We ordered one pie and garlic knots, it came out to be around $30,  with delivery,  wtf?  Finally the pizza gets delivered and we open it and it was more like a medium sized pizza and Luke warm.  It looked like microwaved pizza and it tasted terrible, cardboard like.   I don't get how they use better ingredients and it tastes terrible.   How hard is it to make good pizza?  You need good dough, quality cheese and good sauce, obviously not being of good quality in this place,  never again."}
{"text":"This has to be the worst pizza place we have ever eaten at.  They have never once been on time.  Their delivery almost always takes 45 minutes, if not longer.  That means after the site says \"boxing\" or \"on its way\".  It doesn't matter if it's Tuesday or Friday, the pizza is always cold and their excuse is always that they're under staffed.  As I'm writing this, we're just being delivered the pizza 1 minute to an hour which is apparently acceptable to the driver, who also \"lost\" our receipt, which I guess was his way to buy enough time to run away due to our pizza having 5% of it with cheese on it and being ice cold.  The few times they get the second attempt right, it's very tasty.  Papa John's use to be my favorite pizza place.  The fact I can only get delivery from this specific store because of location has made me never ever want to eat here again.  This is going on my Yelp and I will do everything to make sure not a single event I ever host or family and friends night I have will ever have Papa John's at it again.  You have permanently lost a very loyal customer.  3 months of every order being wrong is too much.  If you order from here, I hope you don't care what toppings you get or don't get, if there is hair on your food, or if you don't get your pizza for 1-2 hours."}
{"text":"Do Not order delivery here! Takes FOREVER & the pizza got here not fully cooked! Sloppy doughy in the center. Pile of grease. Never again"}
{"text":"First off this review is concerning the Delivery man of the pizza and not the restaurant. The pizza was good but the delivery service provided was on par with some of the worst I've ever seen. It was clear that he was disgruntled and annoyed with the delivery that night. \"Hey, can you turn some light on out here so we can so business\" said the dilivery man with an attitude. Then I asked how much was the total, handed him the money and to my disbelief he yanked the money right out of my hand. Literally YANKED. All hell broke lose after that. F words being thrown around. Rudest delivery man ever."}
{"text":"Order was right exactly what I asked for and did all online! I was surprised at the late hours on base normally food establishment close at 8. Only down side on line wouldn't allow me to make my order delivery. Had to drive to pick up! They also don't offer as much in there special offers as other stores in the city do."}
{"text":"DO NOT GO HERE!!!!!!  Called in an order. They said it would be about 45 minutes. About 5 minutes after we had originally called we called back to let them know we'd like to pick-up the order rather than have it delivered (decided to run errands rather than be lazy pizza eating fattys). \"No problem\", they said,\"45 minutes!\". 45 minutes pass and we go to pick up the pizza. When I entered no \"hello\", no \"just a minute\", I just stood there for a good 5 minutes before I had to flag someone down and let them know I was there to pick up an order. They said my pizza wasn't ready and it was being made right now. \"Come back in 10 minutes\". I went to my car to wait and about 5 minutes later went back in and waited patiently......for about 15 minutes. I then had to flag someone down and let them know I was waiting for my pizza. They disappeared for 10 minutes and came back only to tell me I had to wait another 10 minutes.   I would also like to note there was a woman who had been waiting there long before I even showed up and was getting the same run around like I was.  So once again, after waiting 10 minutes, I go back inside. And once again, there was no one there to greet me or give me an update. Everyone was running around like a chickens with their heads cut off. After standing there for another 10 minutes a crowd of maybe 8 people had formed in the lobby. Not a single one had been greeted or acknowledged. I was able to flag someone down, who once again wandered off and came back only to tell me my pizza had left for delivery. WHAT! It was then I asked for my money back and then, ONCE AGAIN, the person I had been talking to scampered off. I, AGAIN!!! had to flag someone down where I explained to them what happened and that I wanted my money back. It was at that point the woman, who informed me that my pizza had been sent to delivery, came up to me and VERY rudely said, \"Ummmmm...I'm trying to get a hold of the driver...ok?\". NO. NOT OK. I demanded my money and went to hit a drive-thru.   *I have worked in a pizza shop before and even when you're busy there's a right way to handle things."}
{"text":"This Papa Johns is  beyond disappointing. Ordered a pizza about 2 months ago and the quality of the ingredients was sub par and the crust was bland, wet, and soggy. Of course everyone can have a bad day, so decided to give it another try. Ordered a pizza tonight and unfortunately, the quality was the same...sub par ingredients and a bland, wet, soggy crust. I love olives and must say I've never tasted a bland, tasteless olive even out of a jar from a discount store.   Ordered pizzas here a few years ago and they were good, but I think Papa John's is on a losing streak. Two strikes and I'm out."}
{"text":"No stars, warning...extremely rude manager. Guadalupe or something. Just moved over to this side of town and thought we'd give it a try. Wrong choice. Stick to Marco's where they treat you with respect, get your order right and are happy that you're their customer. I should of read the reviews."}
{"text":"Seems like people either love or hate PJs. I love it and have it a few times a month which isn't a lot by college standards. Favorite is the Spinach Alfredo and Hawaiian BBQ Chicken - both regular crust."}
{"text":"Yes, it's a chain. I support local when I can but damn, Papa John's is some good pie.   Ordering a pizza is a 2-person job in our house- one to get the pizza, the other to hold the dog. The drivers are always friendly, though- our regular guy even knows the dog by name and talks to him when he drops by. Delivery is always on time, hot, fresh, and delicious. Both the roommate and I are regulars. (Can I say frequent pie-ers? Is that cheesy?)  I love the online ordering and the daily specials. You also receive points for online ordering. I almost saw Jesus a few months ago when I came home from a 10-hour shift and found out I had enough points for a free pizza. You can also pre-tip when you order, saving me the trouble of having to scrounge up cash."}
{"text":"Poor customer service  2 hours  to get our pizzas is B.S . Plus the pizza was cold and tastes like crap."}
{"text":"Ridiculous service at Papa John's Store #3399 13749 N Litchfield Road Surprise,AZ 85379 (623)930-7272 I order 2 pizzas for delivery at 601pm (expected delivery within 30-40 mins) I call the location at 704 speak to a man who says oh the driver is on his way. Now 735 still no pizza OR PHONE CALL I call back the woman who answers says oh ur order has been voided! Wth??? So she checks the situation out and says your address isn't coming up in the system (mind you they have delivered to us many times) they claim the driver called which he didn't. The girl then states that my pizzas have been sitting on the rack. So as someone who works in customer service my first instinct would be to see how the problem can be fixed but no all she wanted to tell me is why I don't have pizzas at my house after 1 and a half hrs! I will not order from papa johns again! Thank you barros for always being my go to who never fail us!"}
{"text":"I'm sorry Pizza Hut but Papa John's is definitely without a doubt my favourite pizza now!   The fact that this is close to my house is very dangerous, but I'm so happy it's super convenient!   My usual orders and you gotta try: John's favourite thin crust well done and pepperoni pizza regular doneness and regular crust. Omg! Heaven!   The pepperoni pizza is one of the most satisfying pepperoni Za's ever! The cheese is hot and stringy, the pepperoni are crunchy around the edges, the crust is soft, chewy and pillowy. Not oily like some other pizza joints.  The John's favourite, is one of my all time favourite pizza topping! You really can't go wrong with pepperoni, sausage and a 6 cheese blend! I've tried it on regular crust and it's great but thin crust- well done is a new discovery that I just can't get enough of! It's like a flaky tasty biscuity crust without falling apart. Eat it while is piping hot!   Oh Papa John's you've converted me!"}
{"text":"Meat lovers, cheesesticks and soda th e dinner of champions! I have been craving pizza and Papa Johns delivered and didnt dissappoint! Thank you!"}
{"text":"****UPDATE****  It has been almost 2.5 hours since I spoke to the manager \"TJ\" about my order and him promising to send out the missing/incorrect items. Now if you read the review below I was suppose to receive the items within 50 minutes per \"TJ\". Order has still not been received, guess his word as a \"manager\" isn't worth much. Suggestion to owners - sounds like someone should have some much needed training on customer service.   I ordered online at 4pm to have pizzas and sides delivered at 5:30 pm. 1st of all, delivery was a little late (not a huge deal), driver did not bring plates as requested (again not a huge deal - he apologized for not having them). Then when the pizzas and sides were all opened to start eating, I noticed that we were shorted on the garlic knots AND the cheese cups that were ordered at $0.75 each. So I called and spoke to TJ at this location who told me he was the \"manager\", which I find it a little hard to believe since he basically called me a liar. After a lengthy conversation with him he agreed to send out the garlic knots again and the cheese cups. Delivery time to be 50 minutes. Unacceptable especially considering that the order was placed a good 1.5 hours prior to requested delivery time and it was not my fault that I was shorted on the knots and cheese cups.   The manager informed me that not all of his employees had common sense and couldn't perform their jobs accurately at which point I told him that if he was the manager then it was HIS job to make sure that all of the orders went out accurately. Of course at this point he told me that he was being kind enough to replace the items that were missing from my order so what else did I expect him to do.   Now if I were the manager of a store like this, first thing I would have done was apologize to the customer, but instead he told me that the driver forgot the cheese cups as this happens all the time and that he knew for a fact that there were 8 garlic knots in the order when he put them into the oven. So he called me a liar and then blamed everything else on the driver. WOW!  I would think that whoever owns this location would get a handle on things in his/her store. Bad managers = orders being placed at a different pizza place.  If I were in the Papa John's \"family\", I would be ashamed of this \"relative\"."}
{"text":"This is very frustrating. I saw the new garlic cheddar knots so I decided to try them. They look nothing like the picture. They look boring not appetizing at all."}
{"text":"It's always over an hour to get our pizza and it's always cold when we get it it tastes like they left it sitting out for awhile I live .03 miles from this location and it takes over an hour for delivery ???????????????? This is crazy ! It's always 31 dollars or more which is a lot if they are not giving good food ! Thought we'd try them again BUT this is the last time cause not okay ! They are also not helpful at this location either  Too many pizza places to go here ever again"}
{"text":"The last two times we have ordered delivery they went to wrong house twice and it took 2 hours to get our pizza this last time. We will not order from this location again. There are too many pizza places in the area to have such terrible delivery service!"}
{"text":"I was given an estimate of my pizza to arrive 23-33 minutes via email and I waited for over an hour to recive my pizza . I called the store and they told me that it would be up to two hours for my delivery , the person on the phone indicated he will have the driver call me there was no call . Pizza finally arrived undercooked :-( . There is an extreme breakdown of communication and service with Papa Johns setting wrong excpetations. I am displeased with my services and in the future will take my business elsewhere."}
{"text":"I order online which is so convenient, the app is very easy to use.  But when you walk in to pick up your order they take your money and decide there and then when you get your items.  If you tip, you get it almost right away or when it's ready.  If you don't tip, then they go back to what they're doing and make you wait.    Also, what's up with the delivery drivers parking in the handicap parking spots.  I'm watching people who legitimately have the right to park there to go either Big Lots, the dry cleaners, or Papa Johns, and they have to park across the parking lot and walk through traffic to get to where they need to be.    When ordering I like to use the app, it's easy to use even when customizing your order.  But be kind to your community."}
{"text":"I would give zero if I could..... I order online.   Stated delivery would be 25 minutes.     I called after 45 minutes and was told it was out for delivery and the driver \"took a triple\" guy said he doesn't know if we are 1st or last.    Should be 15 minutes more. At this call he confirmed my phone number. I called at an hour and a half, they tried to say driver knocked on the door and called.    We are sitting right by the door, we would have heard a knock.    And I have no missed calls on my phone.  I was placed on hold then told my address and phone number were entered incorrectly online. Kinda weird since the last phone call he had the right number, and I checked online and it had the correct address.  Pizza guy said \"o well, we can re deliver\" yeah like I want a pizza that's an hour and a half old!    I told him no thanks, the pizza would be gross by now just cancel my order. Pizza guy \" uh ok I'll cancel it\".  No apology!    I will never,use this papa johns again.    I could have accepted the error, but not the horrible customer service not just once but twice."}
{"text":"We ordered from them mid day during the week for delivery.  It took 2 hours and our pizza was cold.  We were told by the manager that they would give us a free pizza.  We called back a few days later to order and there was no record of the incident.  We will never return."}
{"text":"Dear, anyone ordering delivery pizza with extra garlic sauce pods from this location...don't count on it! We have ordered from here many times because we love PJ pizza. Unfortunately, every time we ask for / pay for extra garlic sauce pods with our delivery order, the extra sauce NEVER comes!!! It is so frustrating and disappointing!! And if you call to alert them of their mistake, they say there is nothing they can do about it unless you want to come to their location to pick it up. Why do you think we ordered delivery!!?? The pizza seems to always turn out fine but if you have any extra requests for your order, you can almost count on that your pizza wishes will not come true."}
{"text":"Unfortunately the manager on duty is a combination of stupid and arrogant leading to a hilariously annoying conversation. He was rude upon immediately answering the phone. I placed my order, and then politely asked if the 25% coupon was applied to both pizzas I'd ordered. He responded in such a condescending way that he absolutely was NOT applying 25% to both pizzas but only to the whole order. I said, oh ok, that's sort of the same thing isn't it? Nope. He gets even more rude as he explains that 25% off each pizza would actually be 50% off the entire order.  I'm not sure where he learned that way of doing math, but it's so wrong it's comical. If this is what you'd like to deal with when placing orders, by all means. Luckily, the delivery drivers are always pleasant."}
{"text":"I'm giving 4 stars because, my pizza was not as I ordered it on line but when my son called and explained that we have someone with an allergy to certain ingredients the manager Tony sent out a new one right away. People make mistakes, but they made it right. I will continue to order from this location. Great customer service! And I think it's awsome you can request special instructions for delivery. I have a Doberman that gets agitated by the doorbell and you can request that you are called when your pizza arrives"}
{"text":"Pizza wasn't cut manager was extremely rude wouldn't ever come back, tastes like cardboard"}
{"text":"Wow. The young lady who answered the phone did not have a clue.  Did jot know specials and ended up with the wrong order and address after repeating it three times. The driver called from a number I did not recognize so the call went in answered. Over all just horrible cold product but who do you blame it on.. Not the driver he was following directions from the person who should not have been on the phone or the person who did not train the associates correctly?"}
{"text":"The general manager is very rude at this location. Zero people skills and it shows. Walked in to the store and was told \"we're not open yet\" in a very curt and rude manner. Why the doors were open if you're actually closed is my question? Why can't you offer to take my order and let me know you'll begin making it when you are 'actually open'?  Guy is an old, wrinkly jerk and I wouldn't buy pizza from him if he was selling it for a quarter. Hopefully ownership takes note."}
{"text":"LOL at the thought of customer service coming from this location!!  One of the main reasons I will come to papa johns is because of the garlic dipping sauce, well now they can keep that because I will not be coming back to this place. Let me explain my experience.. I always voluntarily give out my email address because I love getting great deals/offers. I attempted twice (cell phone & desktop) to place an order using a promo code, it would not go through. I called the store and explained my issue, and asked if I could hold, then was hung up on. I called again a woman picked up, explained again, before I could finish she said there was nothing she could to do to honor the online coupon then stated its not her fault my computer or phone wasn't working (try your website)  I asked for a manger, and was hung up on...   Really your pizza isn't  worth it!"}
{"text":"Online Order would not work... Called in Order... New Employee, gave order 3X Arrived Wrong!!!! Pizza under done, No side of marianara as ordered.  Why bother Order from a cpizza hain if they cant do anything right? Ruined the whole reason for ordering a pie For 30 bucks I can grill steaks  That is what I will do in the future Papa Johns SUCKS!!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"This place is a joke. Ordered pizza on the day I was too sick to cook for my son. THEY FORGOT TO DELIVER MY FOOD! It was an hour after I ordered it that they called to tell me and told me it would take another hour. I asked for a refund. I noticed that they also charged me twice. I'd better get refunded for both!"}
{"text":"I've been trying to use a promo code I got in the mail and it just doesn't seem to work, it says it's expired when it clearly says it doesn't expire until 4/30/16. I called customer service and they won't let me use it either, they say it's expired and kept saying \"I'm sorry ma'm it expires 1/31/16\" when I was holding the coupon right in front of my face. I was getting so annoyed, I just hung up. Anyway Papa johns ya'll needa update them coupons!!!!!!"}
{"text":"I love Papa John's pizza.   Not being from New York or Chicago, aside from mom and pop places, the franchise places are all we have.   Out of em all, I am partial to Papa John's.  This particular one, leaves a bad taste whenever I go.   I would say I was a regular until the problems started.  I'll list two.  Knowing how long orders take, I call before leaving work to this location to place my take out/pick up order.  I arrive about five minutes after my given estimate time and let the staff know about my order.  They say I never called.  I show them my phone and my call duration with their specified store phone number yet still.. No order for me.  So I leave, of course.. Upset..  Incident number two.  I try my luck a couple weeks later to see if I get better service.  I call before leaving work again for a take out.  They answer, \"thank you for choosing Papa John's, would you like to try our special of any large any topig pizza for 11.00?\"  I say yes and ask for a meat lovers and an order of wings.  The order turns out to be 28.00.  I find it weird that my wings would cost over $15 bucks, so I call back to confirm my order.  Speak to the same person who took my order and told him my dilemma.  With a sigh he asks if I have a coupon for the special and reply how the special was offered upon ordering.  Given another sigh from the person I'm granted the special price.  I drive to the place to pick up and plastered on their window and a huge billboard is the special with no mention of coupon.  Needless to say, this place gets a one from me."}
{"text":"Not sure I will go back. The value experience in the US is so much better. As they get more buying power here in Canada, prices will drop. Pizza is a very competitive market..time will tell."}
{"text":"I shared the story with a PJ Manager to remain nameless and he told me that the franchise owner would rather owe a free pizza then pay extra or correct amount of drivers to be ready. Has anyone else experienced long delivery times? My last two orders where 1.5 hours and 3 hours. and yes they did offer a free pizza code and a standard form apology both times."}
{"text":"I will never order from Papa John's again!! The worst customer service I have ever experienced. I have called and spoke to the manager about my complaint and he has blown me off every time. I ordered 20 pizzas for an event at my work, on the company credit card and these people cant even provide me with a receipt! I have been asking for one for 4 weeks now, and still nothing... I finally had to declare the receipt lost (as per company policy) but damn Papa John's... GET IT TOGETHER!!"}
{"text":"We like to go here to pick up a pizza as we are out and about.  If you call ahead it's easy to pick up.  We like to get a 4 topping L pizza: Canadian bacon Bacon Pineapple Jalapeño  It's really yummy and add dipping sauce for even more flavor!"}
{"text":"I've had three bad experiences at this location.  The pizza's not that great.   Prices not that great.  Every time I try to get a discount they have an attitude.  I will never purchase another pizza from this location again.  Once they messed up the order.  Another time I ordered online for delivery and it never showed up.  They told me not to use the corporate site to order pizza online.  I say then why have a website at all?   I mean what's the point.  As far as the pizza goes, the crust is decent.  Good texture. Good taste.  They skimp on the toppings.  The cheese is not that great.  Sauce was sort of sweet like it has a lot of sugar in it, I sort of liked it.    The Philly Cheese Steak pizza however is sort of gross.  It tastes like it has miracle whip on it - nasty.  I expected it to taste like a real cheese steak.  It certainly didn't have enough or the right kind of cheese for a cheese steak pizza.  It had some sort of weird sauce on it that I didn't care for at all.  If you call it a cheese steak, it should taste like a real cheese steak sandwich - it's as simple as that.  Two thumbs down on this.  On the other hand the cinnamon dessert pizza was pretty good.  In all I give this place about a 5/10 mark on the food.  This location I give a 1/10 for attitude.  For quickness they are pretty quick 8/10 on speed."}
{"text":"Papa John's advertising team does a good job. After seeing the commercial for the large pizza for $10 with 3 free toppings multiple times last night, we decided to have pizza for dinner.  I placed our order online, love businesses that offer that option. We got 2 pizzas, one original and one thin crust. We also got a salad. Total damage after tax and delivery fee but before tip was $28.   Our pizza arrived about 40 minutes after the order was placed, which was what my confirmation email said. Everything tasted fine. Not exceptionally tasty but good pizza at a good price. I still prefer both Villa and Rosati's pizza, even at the higher price, but something a little change of pace is nice."}
{"text":"Disappointed. We have ordered from this location for delivery for years and typically a decent experience. A few weeks ago we ordered two pizzas, some sides and dessert. The pizzas were incorrect. So called to let the store know. They were very apologetic and offered to send a new order out immediately or give us a credit. Being that it was late already, I opted for the credit. They said in order to honor the credit I would have to call the order in instead of utilizing the app. So tonight, a few weeks later, I tried to redeem the credit.  After Long pauses on their end they came back to the phone and said \"only for pick up\". The pizza that  was delivered wrong was delivery....seems to me they should honor their mistake and offer. Frustrating."}
{"text":"This is a long overdue review but I promised the franchisee I would give him a review if I liked the pizza...and I did! I ordered two pizzas, cheesy garlic bread/pizza, wings and the pull apart cinnamon desert. The dough/crust was really tasty. Pies were well garnished and cooked well. Same for the cheesy garlic pizza. Wings weren't really the way I like them. They were still a little flabby but well sauced and my family liked them anyway. The cinnamon desert was delicious! We're a family of 5 and there was plenty to go around. For someone who has always wanted to try this pizza chain, I was quite happy :)  It was a bit pricey but still reasonable!"}
{"text":"Very bad servis they never answer the phone  They deliver the wrong order done with another location More then 1:50 after the first call  There are many other pizza companies that deserve your business much more than this one"}
{"text":"They don't know how to take an order.  Deliver the wrong order after 2 hr   They promise to send another one with the right order 3 hr and still no pizza  Why chain like that keeping this location and distorted their mane"}
{"text":"Only giving one star because zero wasn't an option.  We were 2 miles from the store took over half an hour for it to be delivered. The delivery driver didn't have anything marking his car as delivery, as we were staying in a hotel this would have been helpful. Got our pizza and the order was wrong, they forgot to put the pepperoni and sausage on the pizza. The lady I spoke to was rude."}
{"text":"A couple weeks ago (during the first Badger game), we ordered a pizza for delivery.. apparently so did everyone else, because it took awhile to get our pizza. Actually, we didn't really notice or think that it took too long.. but when the driver arrived with our pizza, he apologized profusely. No big deal! It's a busy day, totally understandable! Well, a week or so later, we received a coupon for a FREE large pizza in our mailbox, apologizing again for the wait that day. Not even a buy one, get one free... totally free, no strings attached. THAT is good customer service! We didn't complain at all about the pizza taking a little longer.. but Papa John's values its customers enough to recognize a situation that wasn't up to their standards, and they fixed it. Very cool."}
{"text":"I received email confirmation of my order at 2:12 pm which estimated delivery in 30-40 minutes.  After a 2 hour wait and 2 phone calls to the store we finally received the order.     The first call was at about 1 hour after placing the order, and the female employee assured me I would have my order \"within minutes\".  The second call was about an hour and 30 minutes after placing my order and after 9 minutes total hold time I was told by a male employee my order had left the store and was enroute.  So, the employee I spoke with on the first call clearly just told me what she felt like she needed to in order to get me off the phone.    Our order finally arrived almost exactly 2 hours after being placed.  Driver stated at that time that he had possession of my order for about 20 minutes before arriving at my home, however the pizzas were already room temperature by the time they arrived and had to be put in the oven before being eaten.   Further, they were both somewhat bland.  My guess is that they were made and then sat at the restaurant for quite some time before going out for delivery.    Papa John's was a big pizza fail today."}
{"text":"I had to order LOTS of pizza for delivery at a hotel for a team dinner.  As an out-of-towner I was worried that something would go wrong and I'd have a mob of hungry teens on my hands.  I shouldn't have worried. The delivery gentleman was prompt and courteous and thanked me for the order even though it extended his work day.  Everything was great, the only reason I am not giving 5 stars is...well...it's just pizza."}
{"text":"Had several pizzas delivered to my work not my choice at all but anyway they were 25 minutes late and of course the pizza was already cold and taste like crap, don't know why people think that this or dominios pizza is any good , my grandson could make a better tasting pizza,"}
{"text":"Wow... what a difference a couple of months makes. Either I caught them on a good day last time or a bad day this time.... WHAT HAPPENED?  For starters the order was off. No biggy, this old soldier knows how to adapt and overcome, especially when it comes to pizza warfare behind enemy lines. But it just didn't taste great. It didn't taste bad per se, it just sort of didn't taste. The wings were good, but then how hard is it nuke frozen wings and slather them in sauce... they were fine. But the pizza just lacked in every sense of the word, or word of the sense (of taste) for that matter. It just served to fill my gut and add another couple of pounds to my voluptuous figure. I accept that price, but the food has to taste good, and this didn't.   Look, I don't need to be off-the-chart inspired by pizza, but it needs to taste good. This time it was just kind of blah and pointless. It didn't \"suck.\" But it was heading in that general direction.  It gives me no pleasure but I'm afraid I'm forced to place PaPa John's in the \"Suspended and under future review\" file. It wasn't a crime against the sanctity of the holy pizza realm.... but it wasn't good pizza. There's just too many good pizza joints out there to waste my waist and cash on this place. Sorry PaPa's, you're not fired yet, but certainly on probation with me. I'll give you another shot in the future, maybe, but for now it's bah-by."}
{"text":"I use this Papa John's for delivery and never have had a problem with this location.  The pizza always shows up before the estimated time of arival, it comes hot and they have never messed up an order.  Last night I had the nicest delivery person ever.  She told me my puppy was cute, commented on the movie I was watching, went over my order to make sure it was correct and thanked me repeatedly for my tip.  I hate Domino's and I can't rely on Pizza Hut to show up but I love my Papa John's."}
{"text":"I was never a real pizza loyalest but I have to say that PAPA Johns has been my go to place for pizza. I can't believe I'm admitting this but I have  a P/J account and order online !  (at least I haven't gone full app yet)   Ordering on line is fast and easy ...oh, and its idiot proof since you see a picture of your pizza ...so if you don't know how to spell pepperoni, you can at least see them rain down onto you digital pizza !!  I do love ordering on line avoiding the yelling back and forth over the cooking hood fan and other noisy distractions that plague take out places.  I was miffed about the automatic opening of the pizza box but it seems I wasn't alone because now its \"optional\"   and the counter person asks if you if you want to see your pizza. While I do appreciate the personal pride they have in showing off their hot new pride and joy, I prefer the heat stay in the box until  after I make the long ride home.  (I've had no error pies yet)  The personnel have always been friendly and pleasant although the front smoking is tacky and are we washing our hands when finished before handling food?  (you should be)    Over all I love P/J pizza and its far less salty than that Hut  next door and you have to appreciate a guy who loves his car !!"}
{"text":"I have been going here for almost a year now.  And they have always been fast and friendly.  The online ordering is a little sketchy at times but its very convenient and has better prices than the standing in-store prices.  Annie is the best!"}
{"text":"Papa Johns pizza is OK, we skip around the big chains when we don't feel like sitting down at a real pizza joint. The pizza itself is OK since we usually pick it up from this location due to their crappy delivery service. The in-store service is just crappy as well, probably the worst of any pizza place we have been. It's not even one particular thing, it really is just an all around bad experience, and has been like this for a couple of years. It's too bad, I like the garlic sauce that comes with the pizza!"}
{"text":"Such a delightful manager. We ordered pizza and we're not satisfied with what came to our home. So I called the store and expressed my feelings. The manager remedied the situation and I had a new pizza within half an"}
{"text":"Ordered online and delivered earlier that the estimated time. Delivery guy was so polite and wish I would have gotten his name. Thanks pizza is yummy!!!"}
{"text":"I'll keep this simple and sweet.  Without fail, it takes three to four phone calls to actually get through to someone to place an order. Then most of the time I get thrown on hold for over 15mins or even hung up on. I live in a two mile radius of this store and delivery takes a good hour to an hour and half.  Not sure what the deal is here but this store never seems to have a line up out front, so I'm a little confused as to why they struggle.  When we get the pizza it's actually not so bad.  Tried it a few times and won't order again. There are too many other good pizza joints close by"}
{"text":"Thus was overall a horrible experience. I wish 0 stars was an option. They originally told me 30-35 min for delivery and when I called after an hour  they lied and told me they have been telling customers 1 hour and thirty min. The pizza was cold undercooked and below average and they put minimal toppings on the pizza. The wings were slimy and disgusting. I will never order from here again."}
{"text":"Had a fabulous pizza experience at the Papa John's in Hilton Head, SC and wanted a replay of that.  I ordered a pan pepperoni and sausage pizza to go. I returned to my hotel and dug in. The best thing I can say about it was that it was still nice and warm. I expected spicy cheesy goodness but the sweetish pizza sauce was the loudest note. They applied too much of it and not enough cheese. I couldn't even find the sausage. The meat toppings were all saturated with that sauce and it dulled whatever flavor they might've had. Two stars for this place. One for customer service and the second for the temperature of the order."}
{"text":"Delivery took 2 hr, and I live just few block away from a store. Pizza was cold and pretty much waist of money."}
{"text":"i got slammed at papa john's tonight.  ordered pineapple, onion and pepperoni and got olives and pepperoni.  i had dreamt all day about my pizza.  got little satisfaction and no customer service by the night crew that botched the order.  don't go to the 27315 detroit store if you want a pizza that you ordered.  frustrated and never to return customer.  no customer service like this would be satisfactory to corporate.  they have a long ways to go to be big league.  off to domino's.  kdg"}
{"text":"Always great delivery service here. However, whenever I ask for \"Chicago Cu\"t (in squares) they simply ignore it about 50% of the time. I usually have to call after I place the order online to make sure they cut it right. How hard can following simple order instructions be? ARGG!"}
{"text":"Hello. My experience today ordering a pizza for delivery was terrible. The pizza was an 2hours and half late. had  be remade. the manager of the facility of Papa John's was very rude. They said they couldn't find my address and that I gave them the wrong address to deliver to my home. When I called to find out where my pizza was they had the pizza driver call me. I gave him the address again he still cannot find my address because he was looking for the wrong address once again. This location of Papa John's must be ran by children. They cannot find one persons address this is ridiculous. I did pay for the pizza I should've got for free. I would never order Papa John's Pizza again  at this location or any other location. Once again the manager at this location acted as a child hung up the phone after he told me the pizza was being sent out again of course in a angry childish voice. This incident took place on  October 10th between 6:30 p.m. 9 p.m. And to the management of Papa John's Pizza. Whoever was the manager on this night please give him back his Legos and send him on his way this person cannot handle a simple phone call without getting angry I can't imagine how he treats his employees. Again I will never order from this pizza place Papa John's again anywhere."}
{"text":"I am in the middle of moving and after taking my 1000000 trip ;) I was NOT GOING TO COOK!  Pizza please, close place and staff seemed good on phone.  I do however have 2 complaints following now...  This spot is great, looking for a nearby spot from our move PLEASE FEED ME!  So hungry and so tired after the move just wanted some food...  We decide Pappas I am an ever so slight a newb so I look online for a menu.   First complaint I cannot find a menu online unless I put in a password and a whole bunch of crap.  I LOVE  pizza but do not order it enough to put all my info in just to see if I even want your pizza.  So my comment to you is why make me do that?  If someone told me to order your Pizza Im gonna give it a try but give me the option and be people friendly.  So any ways I had to call the Pizza shop just to ask if they had a sausage and lots of veggie kinda Za and a price.  To my happy  and knowing surprise (who doesn't have this kinda pizza) the guy on the phone was cool was not annoyed at all the I was a semi virgin.  I told him what I wanted and he made it happen, not a hard task but we were happy, also SUPPER happy that is was on sale. I walk in to the shop and tell them my name and the guy at the counter says \" I think i'm the one who talked to you on the phone\"  Kinda cool and personable they also yelled out in the back, HIHIHIHI kinda weird but cool as well (felt like I was suddenly transported to starbucks).  My second complaint is I am kinda annoyed by having to pay for garlic butter sauce.  It is only 49 cents but when I asked and he told me I realized there were already 2 in the box then he charged me for 2 more.  I don't need 4 just tell me \"hey I threw a few in the box\"  I'll tip you but charge me when you already gave me some?  Ugghh...  The Za was fresh crust in-between thick/thin the veggies were ok not super fresh but good, I have had better sauce it was sparse a good ZA is one that can combine it all This is not combined that is why you need to pay the extra 49 cents for garlic butter to make it better ;) good but not great..."}
{"text":"Unfortunately this place has gone downhill since this changed to a franchise rather than a corporate owned location. Only half off pizza rather than whole menu. Every time I go pick up a pizza the place is a mess. Counters and floor have flour everywhere. Nothing looks wiped down and pizzas were upside down because they fell out of the baker because someone forgot they were in there. Also the roof was leaking in multiple spots after a monsoon and it was chaos in the store. It looked like an auto shop rather than a pizza shop it was so dirty.   Came in the other day and there was one gal kneading dough and after she had me sign my receipt with flour all over the pen she went back to work without washing hands after handling office material filled with bacteria. I've almost had to go to hospital because of food poisoning in the past. If I was a health inspector this place might have been shut down.   I have gone to this location the last three years and it doesn't seem to be getting any better. Very sad. Might have to take my business to some other sub par pizza joint."}
{"text":"Papa Johns driver near my house ran a red light and almost hit a car.. At least their customers are getting their pizza on time!"}
{"text":"Worst service ever. Pizzq was 45 min. Late and cold. Driver was unconcerned even though I gave him a 10$ tip because it wasnt his fault. The manager is a bumbling moron and said he didnt knlw what to tell me and have a good day, to which I reminded him it was 8pm. I told him I was going to talk to the corporate office and he laughed. Either corporate doesnt give a damn, or he doesnt give a damn or both. Will never go there again and will tell everyone."}
{"text":"The 2011 super bowl - I placed a simple order for a large pizza and bread stick just before kickoff.  The phone conversation I had with them was epic.  \"We ran out of this... we ran out of that...\".  Oh and delivery will be 2 hours!!!  I understand that you are going to be busy on the day.  But the store manager should have been prepared and made sure to stock up and staff accordingly.  The pizza was not good.  Complete waste of time.  I tried contacting the Papa John's about this store and how badly it was run but there is no way to do that.  I guess they are okay with bad service and low quality food."}
{"text":"Good pizza but breadsticks get under cooked often. Always ask for things to be well done! Good location and easy online ordering. I tend to call though as there is no well done option I can find. Small parking area too."}
{"text":"Been ordering take out and occasional delivery from this location for about 5 years.  We aren't frequent pizza eaters,  but have been ordering more often now that Papa John's added gluten free pizza - granted it is not completely free of gluten exposure but nice option for those gluten sensitive or choosing to limit it in their diet.  The app is nice and the location good for pickup on the way home in the summerlin area. Have always used the app, and have never had an order messed up.  You do have to figure out the app and maybe takes longer than a phone call, but no waiting on hold and No order mistakes.  We love the healthier, less greasy pizza style of Papa John's and chicken and fresh veggie options too.  Using the app points and deals always available make the price reasonable.  Full menu prices are a bit steep for pizzas that are smaller than competitors.  They do tend to go light on the use of sauce, but there is a an option for heavier sauce as well as light or heavy cheese when ordering on the app.  We light hand tossed crust with heavier sauce no matter what toppings were ordering.. also the premium 4 blend cheese alternative is tasty and we put that on most everything as well.  Enjoy!!"}
{"text":"Consistently on time and they always get the order right."}
{"text":"worst PJ's ever!  I've ordered from this particular PJ's three times and each time there's been something bad. First time they forgot to make one of the three pizzas we ordered. Second time was a delivery that was supposed to be delivered within 30 minutes but arrived an hour later. Third time they were extremely rude when we went to pick up the order. They assumed I was someone else when I had walked in the door and barked \"5 minutes\" at me. 5 minutes what? The F you talking about? He thought I was someone who had called in earlier... what a douche.  All three times they never had peppers or cheese. I will never again return back to this PJ's."}
{"text":"You can have fresh ingredients but if you put them on cardboard crust......it does NOT make a better pizza. The slogan is untrue. Worst pizza crust ever. Never again."}
{"text":"The only reason that this Papa John's location is getting 3 stars is because the food is pretty good. However it should be when it is standardized. I'm giving this location a poor rating in regards to service. I ordered delivery and the delivery guy couldn't figure out how to buzz himself into my apartment building. Also, I ordered an extra order of the pepperoncini peppers. I literally received 2 peppers instead of the normal one and the one pepper was cut through where the pepper juices soaked the cardboard box. I'm really disappointed with the lack of care given to my order and will be going elsewhere from now on."}
{"text":"Tim was very nice to us and gave us great customer service!! That's much appreciated. Also pizza is good."}
{"text":"Ughh!! I am done ordering from this Papa John's only because I have received pizza twice that was not cooked fully. The pizza was mushy like you were basically eating dough!! Lol!!"}
{"text":"FAST delivery always. Super impressed cause we're probably on the outskirts of their delivery area. Keep it up!"}
{"text":"Pizza is always great.  But waiting 20/30 minutes for my order when I'm the only one in the restaurant?  Three people working?  A customer came in, tried to get staffs attention.   Nothing.  After seven minutes, I opened the door to the back, flagged down a staff member, and had to let them know a customer was waiting.  We literally could have went behind the counter, help ourselves to sofas and staff would have not know The difference!"}
{"text":"Listen, if you are looking for great pizza delivery and taste at a low cost, this Papa John's is a great option.  I usually order Spinato's, but every once in awhile I crave Papa John's sauce and enjoy pizza half of what Spinato's charges."}
{"text":"Unbelievable !! I just called to order a pizza , and the kid who answered the phone shouted out a special , I didn't get what he was saying , so I asked him again .i had to ask him 3 time to repeat him self .he didn't want to repeat it because he keep say what do o want .. He was very RUDE !! By yelling at me again ..the special , and then said NOw how can I help you ..Rude !' I know there busy but I'm a paying customer I've order pizza from them before the employees need some training on customer service and how to talk to someone in a more pleasant toon of voice . Shame on yall .. It's okay I can't order my food from someone that's nasty in the phone . I hung up and called Pizza Hut and I spent $56., Sorry papa John's you're losing money"}
{"text":"Picked up a pizza and breadsticks tonight. Great food, and friendly service. Great visit."}
{"text":"Ok, \" not Ok \" We ordered ahead meat lovers for pickup it was ready ok   Asked for lite sauce they did not lesson  This pizza was the worst looking and did not taste good. Recommend not to order for this papa johns"}
{"text":"Pretty good. The pizza is just ready when I arrived to pick. It is hot, with crispy crust. I like it."}
{"text":"Love their pizza. They used to have a great takeout special on Monday's, not sure if they are still doing it. Something like $6 for a large!"}
{"text":"This place is full of scam artists.   A few weeks ago I ordered pizza from this location. I did it on accident, thinking it was the location closest to my house. When I got the order back to my house, I realize they forgot all of my sauces, but they were all listed on my receipt.   I called the store and talked to the manager, who said that because it was an online order, he couldn't do anything to help me this time, but told me he'd notate my account and would credit me for next time.   Well, I just called in and talked to the same manager who told me that he didn't see any credits on my account and refused to help me out at all. So I paid in full for a bunch of sauces and then got duped out of a refund for my missing sauces. Not good customer service. Not the Papa way."}
{"text":"Always great service and either on time or early for their quoted delivery times. They always have competitive specials and the food is always hot!"}
{"text":"Well I was very disappointed with the service here today . It was a game day so I understood. But I did a call ahead at 4:45 for my pizza to be ready for pick up at 6pm . I get there at 6:05 and the young lady at the register said it wasn't ready yet . Which I didn't understand . I asked why it was ready if I called ahead she went to check and she said it was JUST placed in the oven . What ? If you offer call ahead that makes NO SENSE. Then another lady came to speak to me which wasn't a manager just another cashier . To explain the call ahead she said that it gets printed 30 minutes before pick up time my receipt says print at 5:45 that's 15 minutes before pick up on a foot ball game . We all know that it wouldn't be ready by 6. Then I asked to speak to a manager and she went to get him or her and came back and told me that he would be a couple minutes . 6:25 I leave with my pizza not have spoken to a manager . when the girl handed me the pizza she asked did u want to still speak to a manager and I said no because he obviously doesn't give a shit. Then she offered a free drink . When I'm mad and complaining I don't want free shit I want an explanation . Get your shit together management . I will never refer or order here again"}
{"text":"My pizzas were cold upon arrival.  Having read all the other awful reviews about this location, I'm shocked the manager hasn't gone to the means required to repair his shop's reputation.  I'll stick with Barro's.  Papa John's pizza isn't what it used to be."}
{"text":"There was only one driver and one worker tonight and the worker was just about the rudest worker I've ever encountered. I asked about a military discount because I am in the U.S. Army and he was very rude saying, \"no different manager, different rules\" I will never order from this store again."}
{"text":"I have never had any problems with the place. Until today. I ordered 1 pizza at 8:02 pm online. It is now 10:03 and it has not arrived.  I called the store almost an hour ago and was told it would be here in 5 to 10 minutes. It is past my bed time as I work in the morning and on an empty stomach. Thanks guys I really wish I would have payed a few extra bucks and got sardellas."}
{"text":"This will be the first and last time I order pizza from Papa Johns... We just moved to our new home and this is the location that is closest to us... Ordered pizza at 8:21 pm online, and even called location for delivery confirmation... Said our pizza would be delivered in 45 mins or less... An hour and a half later, I called and spoke to their manager (Malcom) Answered the phone very rudely... Rudely told me that my pizza has been sitting there for over an hour, Rudely told me that he could make us another pizza, Then rudely told me that they only have one driver... VERY UNACCEPTABLE!!! No customer service WHATSOEVER!!! If I could give them no stars I would... Corporate office notified... WILL NEVER ORDER HERE AGAIN!!!"}
{"text":"I ordered my pizza at 8:42 pm I got it at 9:49pm it was cold. I called to check on it at 9:37 pm because their app said it she delivered between 9:21 pm to 9:29 pm. The guy claimed that he had just left the store then said no he was missed informed the driver left 10 minutes ago. The guy on the phone said they are about to close so that's why it was taking longer. I'm an understanding person I just wanted my pizza hot but it wasn't. If they were still that busy on a Thursday night then maybe they should keep their drivers longer an hour for pizza that wasn't even good nor hot isn't good business."}
{"text":"ok pizza place might has bugs and rats BUT OK PIZZA AND CHEEP TOO"}
{"text":"The pizza is very dry. We brought a large pizza $19.45 and got one free. We got thin crust and is was crusty and dry. I called spoke with manager Ashley and her response was that's the way the crust comes off the truck. In my opinion papa johns should eliminate the thin crust even the staff talks bad about it. Been a customer for a while but I think I am going to switch to dominos or pizza hut. Bad business papa."}
{"text":"Man, I've really gotta say that Papa Johns has gone downhill. My once favorite pizza place has hit rock bottom. Ordered a couple of pizzas the other day only to get home and find that my pizza hardly had any sauce and barely any cheese. It was basically bread pizza. What a pathetic excuse for pizza. Sad times.   Won't return."}
{"text":"Just ordered a pizza... I felt bad for the celery driver because apparently his apartment was broken into, but I was given a pizza that was obviously dropped."}
{"text":"It took them about 90 minutes to get my 2 medium size pizzas delivered to the house. I live literally 15 minutes away from the store, and baking pizza should not take 75 minutes. However,  I gave one more star, because they apologized for the late delivery when I called them to ask about the status on my order, and also their pizza is actually better than the other locations. They made sure to put enough toppings, which made it worth the wait when I was eating them. Maybe, I will just pick them up next time."}
{"text":"I always order online and it is always reliable.  There are always really good deals online.  I know, not the greatest pizza, but for under ten bucks a pie, it beats the alternatives, i.e. little Ceasars, etc.  Close, convenient and cheap.  Triple C's"}
{"text":"This is without a doubt the worst pizza place in town. I am amazed that they still operate under the Papa Johns name. They are always late and over 1/2 the time the order is incorrect."}
{"text":"Actually I forgot to pick up my scheduled order on time. They called me and informed me that since I didnt pick up on time, they donated it to charity. They didnt even charge me or accept my money."}
{"text":"Perfectly made pizzas every time. I've ordered from them for years and they are very consistent. They are also consistent in forgetting the extra dipping sauce that I pay for. If you're carrying out, make sure you check the box before you leave."}
{"text":"Surprised by recent reviews. I ordered my pizza using the Papa John's app. It was easy and convenient. As peppers are a deal breaker, I also called to ensure no peppers and ask for some plates. Operator was courteous and order came as ordered. The 25% discount from the app made it that much better."}
{"text":"Papa John's, always a good choice.  Papa John's makes a good pizza, but as mentioned before, pizza was just warm when it arrived. Delivery time was good and driver was friendly. As far as rude staff, I would have no idea. I ordered online, it was a breeze and pizza came as ordered."}
{"text":"Horribly slow, even if you order 12 hours in advance. Extremely arrogant on the phone. Avoid if you can!"}
{"text":"Of the three big corporate delivery chains, Papa John's has treated us the best in price, quality and delivery time. A few of the independent shops have better pizza, but here you can order online with credit card and consistently receive it in under an hour, usually with little to no drama."}
{"text":"Eat here about once a month. Never know what to expect as far as correct toppings/sauce go, but usually a good eat regardless."}
{"text":"The delivery was fast and the pizza was perfect!  I love to get a lot of sauce on my pizza and Papa John's made my perfect pie.  Delivery was fast and the driver was polite."}
{"text":"Used credit card online to pay for pizza. When the pizza arrived the driver wants to etch my credit card Info on his paperwork. I said no way! He calls manager who said that is there policy and to bring the pizza back! I checked with credit card company and they said under no circumstances should they ever do that! I then called Papa Johns corporate they informed absolutely not to ever give the card to the driver!  Its not a corporate policy just the shady pizza joint down on the corner."}
{"text":"I became a regular, I love pizza from the place. I order online, safe 25% or more and pizza is always ready within 15 minutes. My favorite one is Hawaii BBQ chicken. Enjoy."}
{"text":"Very poor service. I travel for a living and usually like there pizza. They forgot what room in the Motel I was. Lost my name even though they ran my credit card. After a 3 hour wait my pizza finally arrived no discount or receipt for my expenses"}
{"text":"Beginning of football season. Asked wife to order pizza online. 10 minutes later I wondered why my wife had not sent me to pickup the pies. Went into the room and she was nearly in tears. I guess she had ordered online and the website went whacky. She called the location to make sure that the order had actually been submitted. The customer service guy was giving her such grief, like she was trying to steal something. He was talking to the General Manager the same time that he was talking to my wife. This conversation went back and forth for 5 or 6 minutes with my wife at one point telling the guy,. \"I'm sorry bout your website but it sounds like you don't want to take my order.\" I went to pickup the order and spoke to the General Manager. I showed him physically the pic of the website where we had ordered the pizza.  He acted like nothing had transpired and noticing that I was getting pretty agitated, ask me what he could do to make it right. I told him that first he should have the crew member call my wife and apologize. (this still has not happened)  and secondly, straighten the crew member out about customer service. Once again. I've purchased pizza from here on numerous occasions. Sadly, I will never purchase from here again. All I wanted was a stupid pizza and now I have to watch my wife be upset for the rest of the night."}
{"text":"I always order papa john's i think is pretty decent and has good flavors, its very convenient thats its only 200 feet from my house.  Overall i like it alot"}
{"text":"Very efficient workers who were able to stabilize themselves and the whole store while it was so busy tonight."}
{"text":"Papa John's is one of those pizza chains that, at least during a prior point in my life, I remember being good. I mean, it had to have been good, right? I ate it regularly in college for breakfast, lunch, and dinner. And even just a few years ago, when they were the only chain that would deliver to my area, it was still semi-decent, right?  Eh, not quite. In fact, I'd compare Papa John's to a movie that you loved as a child, only to watch it in adulthood and see it for the monstrosity that it truly is.  Every once in awhile, I get a pizza craving. I want it, but don't want to go out of my way to obtain it - so I end up relying on Papa John's to satisfy that craving. And every time, without fail, I ask myself:  Why did I eat this rubbish?  They can market their \"better ingredients\" all they want, but the fact is, their pizza tastes as if it's void of the \"love\" they claim goes into its preparation. Crust has always been incredibly doughy, while their sauce takes on this annoyingly sweet and tangy flavor that's nothing short of distracting. No amount of garlic dipping sauce can help offset just how dull their pizza's flavor truly is. And the fact that they have the audacity to charge a premium for it in comparison to their competitors shows that they at least have a sense of humor. The joke is on us, apparently.  I remember picking up breadsticks here on one occasion. The grease was so sickeningly heavy, that it seeped through the bottom of the cardboard box and managed to stain my girlfriend's jeans in no less than ten minutes, making it look as if she peed herself! How is this even possible?  Okay. So their pick-up location is clean and the workers are polite, so I'll at least give them some credit there. Their delivery time is usually quick given the distance from the store to my home. But if this is your go-to spot for pizza in present-day food culture, I sincerely weep for you and your family."}
{"text":"Terrible customer service by the manager at this location. I was accused of lying and told there was nothing they could do to fix the situation except send me another Pizza at MY cost! I've never encountered such awful customer service in my life, especially from management ."}
{"text":"Pizza pizza pizza!   So Papa Johns isnt orgasmic or anything but I do love the specials they run! I normally get the 2 med 2 tops for 11$ Thats seriously a steal! We usually end up getting one with ham and extra cheese and the other is usually pretty random. Chicken with jalapenos on half and Hawaiian on the other. The toppings are always super yummy and not scarce. I love how they load on the cheese!  Its usually a 15-25min wait depending on how busy they are. What I love about this PJs is the customer service. The greeter lady is seriously super kind, she acknowledges you by your first name if she knows it and is super pleasant. The workers here are also very nice and say hello upon entering. I usually always order from their app or the website on my phone. For the super bowl if you were a club member they sent you a coupon for a free large 1 top and a 2 liter! UM YES!! Its promos like that that win my heart : ) If youre a member of the pizza club you can also earn points towards free pizza! AWESOME!  I'm not saying the pizza is amazing, but the deals and customer service are most def amazing! Good job guys!"}
{"text":"should have purchased a jar of RAGO and poured it on the box the pizza came in!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"Always speedy delivery, nice snack when you have the midnight munchies. It satisfies your demands."}
{"text":"Don't trust this place / driver just took advantage of my son by taking a $7 tip on a $13 pizza - took his $20 and left ... and the pizza tastes like cardboard"}
{"text":"Today I ordered from them for the first time to carry out a large bbq chicken pizza. Wen I got home I noticed that it had onions.  Wen I called them to ask to exchange it I was denied.  So much for customer service.  I May have lost 12 $ for the purchase but they lost a customer for ever.  Thank you tim for providing a horrible experience. I can see why everyone else gives them a bad review."}
{"text":"Called to order pizza. It was late, so I get that they didn't want to make any more pizza. But when making pizza is your job, you do your job, right?  With 20 minutes to close, we called to order, and the dude clearly did not want to make any more pizza. He asked if we wanted pick up or delivery, then, when we said pick up, he revealed that they were only doing delivery at that hour. Okay, so why ask? Just fishing for excuses to refuse our order?  So we opted for delivery, but he refused to deliver to a business address because they said it's a \"safety issue.\" Okay, so it's somehow safer to deliver to a private residence, completely away from the public, than to a public business?  Also refused do deliver to the parking lot in front of their own building. We offered to still pay tip and delivery fee, but no, he said. It was a \"safety issue.\" Apparently it is too dangerous for the driver to step outside the building, where his car is parked, even though he does that for literally every order he has to deliver."}
{"text":"Had to wait 20 minutes for them to count the drawer before I could pay. The pizza was cold when I picked it up so I had to put it in the oven when I got home so it was hot. The employees were lazy trailer trash and black folk. The pizza was really terrible too. It had hardly and cheese and toppings basically was just bread. All employees had no customer service skills at all and Little Caesars has better quality pizza than this and that is kinda sad. And actually just threw it away after heating it up because it was inedible."}
{"text":"We order pizza from work. It was suppose to be delivered at 11:45am. We called at 12, and they just started making the pizza. I guess we will have pizza for dinner!  The first and last time we do this!"}
{"text":"My family loves Papa Johns, so naturally for a 12 year olds birthday party at Gravady we ordered pizza.  I called three days prior to when I needed the order delivered and called the day before to verify it would be there at 11:30am.  At 11:45am I called to see where my order was and was told that it has not dropped down on the screen yet. Of course I was irate because I have called numerous times and now have 30 very hungry kids.  Was told it would be 7 min to make the pizza and 7 min in the oven. Then would make it out on the next driver.  So I would definitely call again that morning if you're expecting a big order at a specific time.  On the plus side, which is why I'm giving two stars, is because they did discount 50% off of my order due to the issue."}
{"text":"Yucko! Suckered me in with a coupon. I am a fan of thin crust NY style pizza. Their thin crust pizza has a saltine like crust, weird. Their original crust is thick, doughy and undercooked. Barros thin crust is SO much better. I and kids wouldn't order again if it was free."}
{"text":"Love this location. Their delivery is always on time. Our orders are always what we ask for. When I call they always try to find coupons for our order and they're generous with toppings. We never order from anywhere else!!"}
{"text":"Overall: 3 stars...barely  Service: 3 stars.  They seemed nice enough, but I can't stand when they charge for crushed red peppers and parmesan cheese.  Food: 2 stars.  It's OK, but I would prefer pretty much any other pizza."}
{"text":"They charge for a packet of parmesan cheese or crushed red pepper.  I've never been to a pizza place that charges for those; they usually just throw a handful in.  They are going to lose more customers that way than they will make up in their $0.10 charge.  The pizza is barely edible too."}
{"text":"People seem to hate this Papa John's; I don't though.  Not sure if it's because it is in the area or because I really just like it.  The service here is fast and the pizza is nice and hot!  I have never had issues with quality of pizza here.  Also, this place has some really great deals online!"}
{"text":"It's not better ingredient it's not better pizza. I live a mile away from this place. I'm busy moving stuff into boxes to move out. I ordered it and it's been 70 minutes and no pizza. I called them and the employee said he had 2 people in the store and 1 driver. That sounds like you have 2 drivers and 1 person in the store am I right? Why can't this place get it together. Charging  $30 for bread and cheese let's go. Come on man"}
{"text":"Friendly staff, usually only go here when craving pizza or when I'm feeling lazy. Not really a fresh looking place, could definitely use a facelift, not as appealing to the customer when you first walk in."}
{"text":"I'm not a huge fan of Papa John's but when I want something delivered, they're my choice.  However, the last pizza I had delivered will be my last, period, with Papa John's.  I became very sick after about 30-45 minutes from eating it.  I sent friends home and spent the night vomiting."}
{"text":"So they be OK if they wouldn't take so long and bring the pizza cold..with really sucks when you just get off work an hungry. I got into with the people one time they told me when I try to explain I pay for it just please bring it..the woman been here there not coming bk I'm like wtf...I'm starving this a joke u got to be kidding..then I just wanted a free pizza ...I was so shocked on how professional they were I didn't mind paying  but not wanting business cause you don't feel like it ...is another"}
{"text":"Not sure what everyone's problem is. I always order delivery from this location and even picked up for the first time today. Never had a problem whatsoever. Today I was going to get a small pepperoni and the lady let me know that they have a large special for a dollar less than the small. Cool! Love Papa Johns. Oh and they're garlic butter sauce stuff  LOVE."}
{"text":"Can we do negative stars????  I just went to order 50 large Pizza's from this location and the Assistant Manager got mouthy with me!!!  I hung up on him."}
{"text":"I had never actually tried papa johns until now because I was so accustomed to ordering Pizza Hut or dominos. Now I'm thinking I should have tried it sooner! I actually really like how they will cut the pizza into square pieces instead of triangles. Also, the garlic breadsticks are amazing!"}
{"text":"Never thought about writing a review for Papa Johns, but Benham our delivery guy deserves this 5 star! He was a super nice guy and delivered our pizza fast. I've had some pretty sketchy people come to our door in the past, but Benham was professional, kind, and I wish he could deliver every time!"}
{"text":"i dont think i have to say much about papa johns..its always pretty good"}
{"text":"This location doesn't seem capable of delivering pizza on time. We've ordered from them several times for work functions that start at a specific time and not once have they delivered our pizza when we've asked for it. Once it was as much as 1.25 hours late. They seem to care very little for other people's schedules. The pizza's good but this was the last time I'll be ordering from them. If only we could trust this company to deliver on what they promise.  UPDATE: They didn't deliver our pizza at all. They called a half an hour after our pizza was supposed to be delivered and said their driver never showed up, so we've got a boardroom full of people and no food. DO NOT ORDER FROM HERE."}
{"text":"Probably one of the worse customer service experiences my boyfriend & I had to deal with.  So me & my bf got one of those free pizza coupons, & we called papa johns to see if we just bring the coupon in or if we have to enable it online, just reassurance on how the coupon works. The kid we spoke to said to order it online & then bring the coupon in and show them & they'll give us the pizza there.  Anyways we call this location around 9:45pm, told them we'll be there soon, and they said ok we'll see you in a little bit.  We ended up having trouble ordering the pizza online so we called and asked what to do next, & that we were almost there, (we were driving from 20 minutes away), & the \"manager\" MIKE, says \"oh well our take out actually closes at 10 so we can't make that pizza for you anymore\" We were like, we just spoke to someone about 15 minutes ago, they should've told us your takeout stops at 10pm, instead of driving all the way out here, & the manager was like \"well there's nothing I can do\" \"soooo is there anything else I can help you with?\" - I was shocked on how a \"manager\" can handle a situation that way.  My bf & I understood that yeah places close, & nobody wants to stay later at work.  Our ONLY issue was that the employees didn't tell us when carry out ended, we thought papa johns just closed at 11pm like the website said. & also how the manager handled it, more like a lazy ass kid if you ask me. I know managers aren't suppose to act that way, very unprofessional.  Hope his review helps! Maybe go to a different papa johns :)"}
{"text":"Great pizza fast service, everyone was super friendly and helpful with my order will come back again in the future!"}
{"text":"thank you for delivering my pizza on time not thank you for delivering it to a wrong address... a great customer service is calling customer's if they received there orders... waited two hours..."}
{"text":"I had to call 4 different times to order a pizza because \"Brandon\" the MANAGER kept hanging up on me. I thought it was the reception of my cell phone or something until Terry kindly answered the phone the 4th time and took my order. The manager \"Brandon\" is rude and lied to me saying the wait is 2 hours for delivery. Besides that he hangs up on customers so they can't order a pizza... he talks with such a slow pace it took him 3 minutes just to say the special. I get that might be a disability but hanging up on people is not!"}
{"text":"I rarely order from Papa John's but thought I would give it a shot. I used their app to order, which could use an overhaul. The app isn't very user friendly. It took about 1 hour & 15 minutes from the time I ordered until the time it got to me. I paid with a card & included a tip.   The driver didn't know what he was doing. He stopped by my place, then left, then came back a few minutes later. He left his truck running in the middle of the street, came towards my door, turned around & went back to his truck. He then knocked on my door. He gave me the food. I turned to put it down & he walked away. He didn't give me a receipt copy nor asked me to sign anything, & never said anything to me.  Once I opened the boxes the pizza looked alright but was like warm in temperature. One of the pepperoni in the boxes looked liked it was bitten into. The bottom part was missing. Overall I was extraordinarily disappointed in how poor the food was & what awful service I got from the delivery driver. I will never order from this place again."}
{"text":"Wish they would hire employees with reading skills....ordered online ...arrived to pick up only to find out they made breadsticks instead of the ordered cheesesticks...looked around the filthy prep area and decided I am better off to get my money back and run....."}
{"text":"Calling in to place our order, I'm immediately put on hold.. waiting 2+ minutes nobody gets back to me while holding. Calling back, again I'm immediately put on hold.. calling back but at that time I'm already arriving at the PAPA JOHNS location. I enter the store and see only one employee working which explains the hassle while trying to phone in with our order.. I'm told that yes he is the only employee and that he is the manager.  Okey.  I am placing the order finally for pizza and a chocolate chip cookie. The manager is unable to view our previous orders ( that has never happened to us before)  He then goes and prepares our pizza, I'm noticing he is not using sanitary gloves when handling food.  The phone rings, he quickly goes and answers it, puts it on hold.. returns to the table and continues to make the pizza, not washing hands in between.   I'm very disappointed in what I have experienced today.   I paid for the order and left. ( Did not eat any of it)   But I will not return to this location of Papa Johns.   HYGIENE and CUSTOMER SERVICE should be your main priority!"}
{"text":"Unfortunately gave the store another chance. I had to place the order ahead of time and it was to be delivered by 12:15. This gave the store well over an hour to make and deliver one large thin crust cheese pizza and a new type of cheese stick option that is available. Very simple. I called the store at 12:25 and was immediately placed on hold. I was told the driver was absolutely on his way. Pizza showed up twenty minutes late. To be honest, I think the driver was sent when I called. The pizza and sticks were not even warm. No apology, no offer to fix anything. Apparently nothing has changed."}
{"text":"Fast service, and polite. My works pizza, and BBQ chicken. Pizza made it here quick and hot. The employee that answered the phone was polite and extremely helpful."}
{"text":"We used to order from here weekly and now it's maybe once or twice every a couple months.  Tonight's order just confirmed why we stop ordering.  The staff was rude and had zero customer service skills.  The food was mediocre and ended up in the trash instead of leftovers like pizza should be.  They need to step up their game with all the new places opening up.  My only question is \"how do you make pizza bad?\"  Pizza is always a go to dinner item"}
{"text":"Sorry Papa John's, but my experiences here have left me really, really disappointed..   My first experience with them was about a year ago- I had a coupon for a free small cheese pizza. Okay, it's a free pizza, so I didn't expect much. Except when I got home and opened the box, there was a SLICE missing... I call them up and they had me come back & upgraded me to a large cheese pizza.   Alright, so I decided to give them another try yesterday, since there was a Memorial Day deal. Ordered a large pizza with 16 wings for carry-out. Said it'd take 15-25 minutes to finish. I arrived there a little over 20 minutes after I placed the order and as I walked in, I get a call from an employee there telling me they did not have any wings and that they had been waiting for over an hour for them to be delivered. Thanks for letting me know earlier! It wasn't until I paid for my pizza that they actually even put it in the oven.   As I waited for my pizza, I saw a huge COCKROACH the size of my thumb near the drink cooler. But hey, at least it was dead.  They sincerely apologized many times and the manager (I believe) gave me a free order for next time. After seeing the cockroach though.. I don't know if a free meal is worth it.  So 1 star for making up for mistakes, but they shouldn't have to be giving me upgrades and free orders in the first place."}
{"text":"This is my favorite Papa John's location in Phoenix! Fast, friendly, and ALWAYS yummy!"}
{"text":"They have that crazy Monday deal which is I think $8 large pizza with any topping. I called and put like 3 different toppings on my pizza and was told that it was be ready in 10 min, when I got there is was ready. Super friendly staff."}
{"text":"The worst service ever! Can't even cook a decent pan pizza without it burning. I will never ever eat at Papa John Pizza ever again!!!!!!"}
{"text":"It was not good service! I basically waited 15mins for my pizza that I order on the phone in advance and all I got offered for the wait was a 20 ounce drink. Terrible I will never come here again! Smh"}
{"text":"Yikes, this location has really bad reviews. I guess I have gotten lucky the more than dozen times I've ordered from here? My experiences have always been good.   I have an account online so I order that way. Even during peak times it has never taken more than 45-60 minutes to have my order at my door. At my most recent delivery the delivery driver reviewed our order at the door and everything was correct, including all of the extra garlic sauces I ordered. I've also ordered takeout (usually before checking out at Smith's in the same parking lot) and it's usually ready in 10-15 minutes. The best part is that I can usually Google \"Papa John's promo code\" and find an offer for 25%-50% off my order.   Some of our local pizza places are awesome, but I really do enjoy a pepperoni pizza from here. Especially with the garlic sauce for dipping. I tried the new Pepperoni Rolls and thought those were a tasty side as well."}
{"text":"I read the reviews before ordering. Well I didn't listen to them, and I'm glad!   I ordered online, it was estimated to be delivered in 21-31 minutes and it was! I ordered the 2 LG pizzas w/3 toppings deal and garlic knots. My order arrived piping hot and on time. The only issue I had was I ordered an extra garlic sauce, and a side of anchovies. I didn't get either, but since the pizzas come with the sauce I didn't mind, the anchovies however I called about. The lady I spoke to was super apologetic and helpful, sending the driver back with them. (I called as he pulled away, hoping he just forgot them in his car and could turn around.) The kid showed up about ten minutes later with 2 garlic sauces and my anchovies, and was also very apologetic!  I will re-order from here, and update my review as needed. For now, this place deserves more credit then what the stars are giving!"}
{"text":"I don't know why they have such minimal stars. I placed my order online for pickup this evening.  I walked in a few minutes prior to when the order was supposed to be completed, and as I walked in a young woman happily greeted me and my husband. She asked if I had placed an order for pickup, to which I confirmed. She smiled and asked for my name. Once she had the info she immediately went to check on my order, which was 3 med pizzas and wings. They were finished, she handed me my order while apologizing that they didn't have a bag for me. Easiest transaction I could have asked for!  I will return!   This was a happy place to visit, terrible parking area, but not their fault. If you have read the terrible reviews, look for the positive ones that provide key feedback! Order for pickup, double check your order, there is no reason I can see this establishment should have such low ratings."}
{"text":"The only consistently good pizza delivery in our area. Delivery times are much better than their competitors and the pizza is always fresher."}
{"text":"I just Called to Place the Most Simple pick up Order which is a Special that the Guy asked me if I would liked and he Messed that up an Then Took 6mins just to take the order to Repeat it Wrong Again."}
{"text":"Just make sure that they don't try to deceive you after at least two-three or even several different people take your order because apparently \"you\" as a customer should retain information more than the person who changes the order from the computer monitor."}

Get 2 orders you won't regret it:)  BEST thing is you"}
{"text":"Worst papa johns ever !!!! Ordered twice here and got my order wrong twice. Didn't even apologize and just told me \"dude, we can make another one in 10min!\""}
{"text":"Ordered my pizza using the app at 2pm. The estimated time for my pizza to be delivered is 35-45 minutes. I understand it could be busy but damn. When my pizza finally arrived it was 3:30pm. The guy who delivered my pizza gave me a half ass apology, only after I asked him if they were busy today. His response was that someone called in sick. My pizza wasn't even hot anymore!! It was just warm, as if my pizza had been sitting out waiting to get delivered."}
{"text":"Great Place and always Great Specials.... Hot food, friendly drivers . Always call in and ask about $9.99 specials"}
{"text":"Just ordered from here around 10pm, and spent $27 on an Extra Large pizza, garlic bread, and a 2-Liter. Come to find out the pizza in the box is NOT an Extra Large, but the Large size (16\"). Having been previously employed by Papa John's I can tell the difference in sizes and what happened. Either they ran out of the Extra Large dough and didn't feel like calling about it, or they didn't want to have to pull the dough for the 18\" since those are not prepared ahead of time. My husband and I have brushed off most of the little things that this location has messed up on our orders, but this hit the last nail in the coffin. If this is your Papa John's location, don't bother; you'd be better off ordering from Domino's or Pizza Hut."}
{"text":"This is the worst Papa John's location in the Valley. I used to Papa John's, but my order gets butchered so much that I'm done. Reading the order screen to make pizza is not rocket science (Used to work for large pizza chain). Don't even bother with this location and go somewhere else. You will save time and money."}
{"text":"I cant believe the experience i just had trying to order some pizza. On HOLD for 15min.. on and off. \"Charles\" would connect back with me then\" one second please\" for 15 min ...... i didnt even get a full address or order before he would place me on hold again. Smh... had to repeat my card 6 times ... ?? Wow. Never again"}
{"text":"This is the second time I've called Papa Johns for a delivery order since I've moved to the area and Both times I've been put on hold longer than 10 minutes and just ended up hanging up. How sad, we used to love Papa John's."}
{"text":"A night and day difference from the 5060 boulder location. After being yelled at a special just because I couldn't understand what the guy was saying, I hung up and called 241 N. Nellis. The guy working the phone at 4pm on 2/12 had great service! He answered the phone and offered a special and said it nice and slow and I heard him perfectly the first time :)  He was extra nice even when I asked him to repeat my address just so I can confirm the correct delivery because I was not getting delivered to the address on file. Thank you for being nice and making it seem like you enjoy customer service!!!  I especially appreciate you calling me back before the delivery guy left just to triple check the address where the pizza was going! Loyal customer to 241 N. Nellis from now on!"}
{"text":"Although I'm always scared to order because of all the bad reviews, my order has never taken more than 30 minutes to get to my house. The pizza is good too. I do always order online so I can't speak for the service over the phone. Online is cheaper too so I recommend doing it that way."}
{"text":"Everything tastes good and delivery was just about 10 minutes late which is understandable at this hour. However, first time they came, the guy forgot all of the extra sauces which we paid for. I called to have them bring those over (the guy I spoke to on the phone was super nice about it) and also the red pepper packets that they'd also forgotten. The guy came back about 25 minutes later with the sauces, but still forgot the red pepper packets. If I would've known he was going to forget those, I could have eaten this pizza when it was hot."}
{"text":"Ridiculously poor, compared to the Taste of Chicago and Rocco's."}
{"text":"So I used to be an avid Papa John's pizza order-er [especially fresh out of college], but my pizza ordering has died down a little.  It could be due to the fact that no body comes over to watch tv, games, etc - all part of getting older....  Their online ordering tool makes it super easy to get you what you want without any confusion and craziness.  I was pleasantly surprised to see the pizza would not come from the normal Matthews Papa John's location, but one of the newer locations in downtown Mint Hill.  I am not sure how long this location has been opened, but it still is about equidistant, but good to know that there is more than one option to serve the area (and would probably reduce the wait time on your pie if there is a slew of orders that one location can't handle alone).  I will have to try to pick up from this place, but delivery is the way to go.  The driver was very prompt (even sooner delivery than what the confirmation email had predicted).  And I was enjoying my 3 topping, large pizza... which technically had 6 toppings (I usually split the pizza with half toppings for a little variety).  Now don't get me wrong... I would love to visit a local, mom and pop place for pizza, but PJ's is definitely my go to for delivery.  I have yet to try delivery with any other local pizza shop just because it is so easy to order online versus trying to call in.. someone mis-interpretting your call or whatnot and pizza distasters ensue."}
{"text":"I haven't had the pleasure of taking out an order from this location, but all my home delivery orders come from this location and it never fails.  The pizza is always piping hot and made well.  The delivery drivers are always nice - I guess it's nice to have a profession in which you bring joy and good food to people (unless you are running late and the people will be ravenously hungry and irate at you).  Ordering online has also been a god-send since you don't have to fumble through asking about specials, etc.  Just click away - the hardest part:  getting everyone to agree on toppings.  It does help a lot that you can half pizza toppings to appease everyone.  Great for feeding a lot of people fast - and easy too... it's pizza... no need to break out silverware!"}
{"text":"The pizza was great and the kids had a blast. Pizza was perfect temperature. The pizza came out on a timely fashion. Staff taking order was very friendly"}
{"text":"Good pizza and good customer service@good price. I Like this Papa John's. I Recommend"}
{"text":"As great as any Papa John's! Thanks for sponsoring our Teacher Appreciation Week."}
{"text":"I order from here a lot because its across the street. But also because they have Always provided me the Best pizza. Its Always fresh and tasty, when I go in to pay I'll ask for crushed peppers and Parmesan. The cashier never gives me attitude like most pizza places. I am a loyal customer to this location."}
{"text":"This is the only place I order pizza from now while at home. It's fairly close and it's good. When you ask for extra sauce you get it unlike other places I've delt with. Love it, my review is overdue. Thanks guys."}
{"text":"Horrible service and pizza  Delivery shows up with no Parmesan,  no plates,  no napkins and without the drinks I ordered  Horrible"}
{"text":"Finally tried Papa Johns tonight and I really, really wish there was more I could say. We ordered a large pepperoni, large spicy Italian and their buffalo wings. Pizza took about 35 minutes to deliver which is pretty average time. The delivery driver was friendly. The pizza was a bit dry for my liking, not enough sauce. I did like the crust which is not too soggy, but more on the doughy side and pretty good flavor. The wings were good and just the right amount of spicy, but very, very over sauced. So not enough sauce on the pizza but too much on the wings. My kids enjoyed the pizza, but there was a lot more leftover than normal. Not the worst pizza we've had, but not on my top five. I'll give this place another try eventually and update it then."}
{"text":"Yikes! Cold pizza when I called in the guy on the phone just acted totally confused & as if he was not responsible in the slightest. $50 of gross! Not ordering from this location ever again. Staff is clueless!"}
{"text":"With the exception of Papa Del's in Champaign, my central Illinois pizza adventures stink. The best part of my medium cheese pizza was the crust with the garlic dipping sauce as the star!  This is not middle school where I thought Papa John's was gourmet pizza. Sure, we ordered our pizza, Papa's Fingers (they're gone now...hahaha), and cheese breadsticks, but I also thought soda was a quality beverage back then.  If I need delivery pizza, I would call again. I don't want to put myself through pizza mediocrity again...."}
{"text":"I come here all the time for carryout as this location is too far from my home for delivery. Good service every time. I has a special order due to allergies and it is perfect almost every time. When it is wrong, they fix the mistake right away and without problems. I highly recommend this location!"}
{"text":"By far the best pizza in town!! Drove an hr just to get a pizza from here!! And let me tell u it's worth it! It's literally better ingredients better pizza!"}
{"text":"Terrible management to create terrible pizzas and experience. Pizzas look like dog food, one manager yelled at me on the phone because I called late. Other nights no one would answer an hour before they close. Employees seem incompetent, I have not seen any of the few good employees they had recently. This place has moved down from alright to complete garbage. Do not waste your money or time."}
{"text":"Horrible pizza. They only give you 1 little pack of  parmesan cheese and hot peppers.  How cheap is that.  Pizza is dry as a bone too.  Very cheap."}
{"text":"Absolute worst customer service EVER!! High school brats that run the place with little or no supervision! When ordering pizza it is supposed to come with garlic sauce.... It says so on the box !! But you are never given this sauce and even when they tell you it's not free and you pay for it they still refuse to give it to you! When you point out where it is printed on the box that it comes with the pizza they will argue with the customer ! Really?!?!? The box clearly states it comes with garlic dipping sauce but their dumbass employees still refuse to provide it! Complaints to corporate office remain unanswered! Time for a call to 8 on your side!! Don't order from this location! They SUCK!!! And pizza is usually COLD!!"}
{"text":"I have never ordered any Papa Johns Pizza period and this would be my first and it didn't disappoint me.  I ordered a x-large pizza with Canadian bacon and pineapples with side orders of Ceasar salad.  Both are delicious and according to the confirmation information I received from them after ordering it online it will take about 15-25 minutes to be prepared, boy it didn't lie.  I normally share stuff to people but this time there were no exceptions because I was hungry. I ate the whole thing to myself.  So if anyone wants something different other than Pizza Hut, Dominos or Little Ceasars, check out Popa Johns  Pizza."}
{"text":"Cold pizza. Delivery driver with a very bad attitude. Delivery from time of order was about an hour when eta was 15-20 minutes."}
{"text":"The chicken cordon bleu pizza is it! I was impressed, fresh toppings including the mushrooms. Good flavors. I hope to relive this experience soon!"}
{"text":"Papa Jons does not care about customers. For example the fact that they had a three topping special but forced me to pick three different toppings instead on three of the same toping even though the ad did not specify the three topings had to be the same. When you start nitpicking with customers with stupid rules like you can have mushrooms, olives, and pineapple but you cannot have mushrooms, mushrooms and pineapple then you are just being jerks.  Needless to say I never went back to Papa Jons ivervthis fiasco despite being a frequent customer until then.  The \"nazi\" attitude sucked and hurt my feelings deeply. It does not surprise me the company is now having racism problems according to the news."}
{"text":"I ordered my pizza, just two mediums, at 6:09pm. I called them at 7:10pm and they said it was already out for delivery and had been for awhile so should just be a few more minutes. As I am typing this review, at 7:30pm, I still do not have my pizza. Papa John's has always taken longer, but this location is my first time at, and it's ridiculous waiting an hour and a half and still no pizza?!  UPDATE:  It is now 8:06pm, they refunded the money(good!). Sending new pizzas out(great!) But had to call me to tell me we were wrong, they did come to our house and called but no answer. Somehow, they didn't alarm any of our 3 dogs, nor me or my husband. Even if it was the case, very unprofessional to calll just to say they were right? Honestly, I don't see why that matters due to the fact that after we called a SECOND time, they marked the pizza as delivered and were confused why we didn't have our pizza. Unbelievable."}
{"text":"Was here today for a free pizza thanks to t mobile Tuesday they had great customer service definitely recommend this place to anyone in Laveen !!!!"}
{"text":"Staff at this location is always friendly and prompt. With all the great local pizza, we rarely order from chains, but Papa John's does make a fresh tasting veggie pizza."}
{"text":"How could it possibly take an hour to get a medium, one topping pizza... on a Sunday night? The store is a 4 minute drive away.."}
{"text":"If you pull up to the store you will never have a spot right in front because those will always be full of delicery drivers cars...employees are condescending, they overcooked my pizza, i asked them to remake it and it was solid burnt. They offered me to come behind the pizza making area in my flip flops with my hair all out to look at their signs on how dark the crust is supposed to be...yay health code violation. Just don't bother...pretty much anywhere is better!"}
{"text":"Great service, super friendly staff, and the pizza was great! Thanks for taking such great care of the teachers of PCA!"}
{"text":"We ordered a pizza and requested the driver to call at the gate as our neighboorhood is new and can be confusing. They did not call. After about an hour we called the store and they said they would have the driver call us. About 20 minutes later we still never got a call so we called the store again, the person that answered said that the driver just decided to leave. How awesome! If you aren't hungry and have a lot of patience order from this Papa John's."}
{"text":"I wish I could give 0 stars. We ordered online around 8 PM and it said 85-95 minute wait so we immediately called after to cancel our order and the person on the phone said it went out the door... HOW?!? we literally just clicked order. Clearly, integrity means nothing. You lied. Not even sure if they ever came because at 10 PM we were in bed."}
{"text":"Way better than the nearby Pizza Hut. Pizza is always good and hot and the wings are always on point. We'll never go to PH again."}
{"text":"Ordered online, got a call a minute later that delivery would be an hour and half and there's only so much they could do since there was only one driver. Saturday night in Vegas with one driver, yikes... Thanks for reminding me why I never order from here."}
{"text":"I like Papa John's pizza but every single time we order from this location it is always late. This time we ordered on a Wednesday night. Email said 30-40 minutes but it took over an hour to be delivered."}
{"text":"We normally order online from our local Papa Johns. While out of town with family we decided to order in and I ended up just calling since it is less than a block away from the condo.   About an hour and 20 minutes after placing the order my Dad was like \"where the heck is the pizza?!. So I call in and come to find out that the driver had another delivery before ours and got in an accident on the way, so another driver went to go get our pizza to then bring to us.   I mean, that is unfortunate, I don't want to harp on an accident. BUT when the pizza did arrive it was both barely warm and was schmooshed into the side of the box. It became a pseudo calzone. It did look like it had been in an accident, which was interesting.  What I would have hoped for is a new pizza to have been maybe walked across the street. We are literally across the street and a few buildings down."}
{"text":"Usually like to order from Papa John's, love the pizza.  But the last 2 times I've ordered online, they have screwed up.  I order extra garlic sauce and get charged, but don't receive it.  And the last order, the driver brought the wrong order, then took it back and waited almost a hour and called them and truerhey said it was on the way.  Well, got the order finally, it was lukewarm!   Called to complain they said next time we would get the same order, free just ask for quality control issues.   Well that seems to be bull!!  Called tonight to take up that, and it's only the pizza, not the cheese sticks and poppers too!!!   Plus they forgot the extra garlic sauce and I  mentioned that and was told they would have to charge me to get extra this time.  Screw that!  U screwed over the wrong people!  Won't be ordering from them again!!  They don't seem to care about u as a customer! !  Do Not order from the McKee Rd Papa John's! !  The manager name was Josh that I talked to.  Luv the pizza but not the service!!!!   Need better customer serivce!!!"}
{"text":"Stay far away from this location.  They will deliver it cold.  Or incorrect.  Or both.  Go to pick it up and they won't even have it cooking.  It's absolutely horrid.  And I've been going there for 3 years but the last 3 months, it's a disgrace to a business. And the review below from \"Trisha\", she is an employee."}
{"text":"After a long day of moving I decided to order pizza from Papa Johns, delivery was great until I opened up the box and saw a dead fly on my pizza.  I was so disappointed.  I hope they fix this."}
{"text":"The pizza is fair, but heres what happened. I ordered online and ordered a chicago cut, I picked up my pizza and when i opened it , it was regular cut. I chuckled shook my head and went to my car, before I could leave the young man from behind the counter came out and told me sir i noticed you ordered a chicago cut and that was cut regular, i will notate your account the next ones on us. So last night I called in to redeem said free pizza and asked for a specific pick up time no problem. When i arrive I get my pizza open the box and there again its a regular cut, I really didnt care but the manager on duty insisted that they make it right, he then gave me that pizza, the right pizza, a brownie and a 2 liter of soda for free. Customer service above and beyond I told him all that wasnt neccessary but he insisted and I wasnt going to argue. I am a food service worker and I appreciated this customer service so much I invited them to my restaraunt."}
{"text":"Oooookay so im currently on hold and about to hang up and take my business elsewhere, its been 11 min.....foward...so i waited and i just got home with my pizzas and cinnamon pull aparts which are cold. Also i now realize why i was on hold for so long. When i picked up my pizzas i noticed that the workers obviously are just there to socialize. While there i saw the young lady put someone on hold only to keep me waiting and continue to converse with her coworkers about nonsense. Never coming again."}
{"text":"It's been a while since I've ordered Papa Johns. It used to be my \"Go To\" pizza place. Then I discovered Barro's Pizza and fell in love. My wife is a teacher and got a Papa Johns promo code for Arizona Teachers for $6.99 1-topping Large pizzas. That's a pretty amazing price, so we had to try it. We got 2 large pizzas - one mushroom and one green pepper. Here's what we discovered (or suspect) about Papa Johns and why we probably won't go back unless we get another awesome promo code.  Before we get started, let's be clear that Papa Johns pizza DOES taste really good. In fact, it's the same great taste that I remember. No complaint with the ingredients - they really are \"better\". The disappointing part is what has changed with Papa Johns.   First - Is it just me or have the Large pizzas gotten smaller? The Large used to be 14 inches and these Larges measured at 12 inches. I noticed the difference as soon as I picked up the box, they seemed smaller. Now I could be totally wrong because I'm used to Barro's huge pizzas, but it sure felt like it.  Second - I believe Papa Johns puts less toppings on than they used to. We always get a mushroom pizza and I remember at least 5-6 mushrooms on each slice, which for smaller mushrooms, is the minimum you need for each slice. This pizza had 2-3 mushrooms on each slice. The green pepper pizza was the same way - 2-3 little slices of green pepper on each slice. Again, I may be wrong because I'm used to Barro's literally heaping toppings on their pizzas, but I suspect Papa Johns has made a conscious decision to use less toppings.  Third - Where did the awesome garlic sauce little tubs go? That used to be unique to Papa Johns and honestly one of the big reasons we loved the pizza. Papa John's crust has never been spectacular, but when dipped in that garlic sauce, it was a unique pleasure you couldn't get anywhere else.   Now - I assume that these issues are Papa Johns-wide and not specific to this location. And if these truly were company-wide decisions to cut costs, then I can accept that. Companies have to do what they have to do. I'm just not happy about it.  But - the one thing I feared is I was possibly getting a lower-quality pizza specifically because I used a 1/2 off promo code. I know some restaurants do this when customers don't pay full price. And if that's what happened, then that's not cool. But even worse, if they did that to school teachers, then shame on Papa Johns.  Regardless, I feel like I should be giving this more stars, especially because the online ordering was simple, and the service was friendly and fast. I'm rating simply on the pizza. And perhaps that's not fair either, judging it based on Papa Johns of the past. But I honestly would never pay the full price of $15+ for a 1-topping Large (or so they say) pizza from Papa Johns. It was a great value at $6.99 but any more than that, I just can't justify it.  Bottom line is I just can't get over how Papa Johns has changed for the worse."}
{"text":"So their supervisor call me and she was nice she gave us  well 3 free pizzas we had trouble ordering on line so we called and let me say Manny and the Manger Eric need more a lot more training to learn what they can and can't do (Manny) and Eric needs to go to manger training he laugh at me several times and called me man he must be a high school kid well like the other guy said in a review. 3 strikes and your out POOR SERVICE AT POOR PRICES That seems like a better slogan for them"}
{"text":"Wasn't well done like I asked, but oh well that's what they make ovens for!!! But if I pay for & ask for it, it should be done the way I asked!! Right on Papa J!!"}
{"text":"Better Ingredients. Better Pizza. Papa John's!  Enough said..."}
{"text":"Used to frequent a lot until Barrows arrived. Gave it another chance and found hair baked into the pizza. They voided my transaction. I will not return, there workers only wear hats with no nets so hair just hangs out the back from female employees."}
{"text":"I have ordered from this location about a dozen times over the past year and a half. I have always had a top notch experience with either pick up or delivery. I have even ordered a head using the papa johns app (apple) and the order is right on time and still very warm and fresh. Every delivery driver has been extremely friendly and very professional."}
{"text":"Apparently under new management. Regardless, still quality pizza at a good price. No complaints."}
{"text":"Better Ingredients. Better pizza. The Papa John's motto...  I think they largely succeed in building a pretty good national standard for pizza pie at low prices ($9 and large on mondays). I ordered online and 15 minutes later when I arrived at the store, it was waiting, nice and hot. The only knock is standard baking (I think there was an option to change this with online ordering) of the original crust is still pretty floppy. I like my pizza crust a little crispy personally.  The other thing that irritates me is that online and in store promotions are often different. This location offer (with a sign outside) $10 any large with up to 3 toppings often (maybe always in the months I have been driving by) which is generally better than online ordering (you have to call it in to get that price or order instore). Of course today I received a national email promotion for any large (unlimited toppings) for $9 on mondays for a limited time which is better than the in store deal.  I love the garlic butter dipping sauce that they include in the box. It makes Papa John's the only pizza where I eat the edge crust. The pepper is a nice touch too."}
{"text":"Great! The only pizza place I order from. I usually pick up but when I'm at work, ill get delivery and they're so fast and friendly!! And not to mention the pizza is delicious!"}
{"text":"We order from this pizza place more than any other- they are pretty consistent and we have never had our order messed up. Delivery drivers have been super nice and efficient- way better than other chains in my opinion."}
{"text":"Awesome Papa John's location.   This is the best John's I've ever been to and the manager is here is absolutely top-notch. I will continue to go to this store for as long as I live in Phoenix and I will continue to choose Papa John's over any other pizza chain solely because of my experience with not only their product, but the people who run their stores (specifically this one).   You cannot go wrong with this location! Great product every time and a great staff / manager to back it up!"}
{"text":"4 stars because the pizza wasn't ready when they said it would be and I was 5 minutes late. That being said the gave me some deal for $6 for carry out so that was cool. To the dude handing out 1 star reviews....you can't review a business when they didn't serve you. People like you shouldn't Yelp. Go to urbanapoon bruh."}
{"text":"Surprised at the low ratings on this particular Papa John's. Everytime I pass by, it looks really clean and well run. Anyways, this review is for the delivery experience.  We ordered 2 Large Meat lovers pizzas, and on half we added black olives, on the other half diced tomatoes.   The guy who took our order was fine. He said it would be 30 min. It came fast, and fresh. Usually I don't like Meat lovers that much, but this one was really really good. The dough was exceptionally good. Super fresh! I will definitely order again."}
{"text":"This location always gets the order correct. I work nights, so I generally order in the morning before I go to sleep and it's always on time 8 hours later. There pizza is always hot and fresh. I love the text deals every day. Papa John's has become my go to for pizza delivery."}
{"text":"Great tasting pizza right around the corner. Just remember to use one of the thousands of coupons out there."}
{"text":"Ordered pizza on a Saturday night around 6:30pm. The pizza was average at best. A decent amount of pepperoni but not especially pretty to look at. We ordered wings too. The wings are supposed to come with ranch, but they forgot to give it to us with our order. The wings were disgusting. One of them may not have been a wing...or even chicken for that matter. Those are some of the smallest wings I have ever seen. I have approximately 20 pizza places within 2 square miles around my house. I won't be ordering from Papa John's again."}
{"text":"Great work on a busy days as Panthers were in the Super Bowl. Kept their cool as orders flowed out the door fast."}
{"text":"I consider Papa John's to be toward the upper end of the pizza chain level of pizzeria. I've ordered from this location 2 or 3 times and the pizza has been great each time. It's definitely convenient for me since it's right outside my neighborhood."}
{"text":"Horrific under cooked pizza!!!!  Called to complain and nothing was done about it.  I guess I'll be taking my business somewhere else. Don't eat at this location because they're slow slow slow!!!!"}
{"text":"2 words: Garlic Dip!   My galpal and I were set to enjoy a cup of coffee at Holly's Cuppa right across but for some reason, open mic night was blocking the entrance and we got too hungry waiting so what better thing to do than grab some pizza to fill the time. She ordered a small cheese pizza ($7.99) with additional toppings of ham and pineapple (you pay extra but I forgot how much that is) that came with a random piece of chili and GARLIC DIP. I couldn't get enough of that garlic dip. It was thaaat good.   Why I chose to give this branch a 3 stars though, is because there weren't any proper seating for a dine-in There was a water fountain, a bathroom and a couple of chairs for people to wait at while their orders were being prepared but if I could sum it up, this branch was solely for take-outs. Because of this, my galpal and I ended up crossing back over to Holly's Cuppa and took advantage of their outdoor seating to munch on our pizzas, not that we're complaining.   Oh and did I mention that their garlic dip was the bomb?"}
{"text":"This is not a review about Papa Johns in general.  I love their pizza.  This is a review of their store.  Terrible!  Terrible and incredibly rude staff, terrible service, terrible manager, and the worst part, terrible pizza.  The last time I ordered from them, the pizza wasn't even edible and the cardboard broke when the driver handed it to me because the grease had leaked completely through during delivery.    Twice they've gotten my order wrong and they don't do anything to make up for it, I've had an employee hang up on me before even telling me the total for my order or asking if it was delivery/pick-up, and they don't honor the coupons online at papajohns.com.  Go to Domino's if this is your Papa Johns for your area.  I don't even like Domino's and order there now because this place disgusted me so much."}
{"text":"My sister & I just went here & spent 20 extra minutes because from the time we walked in the door the guy told us somebody helped us before him & that he just walked in the door. Continued looking around & not able to help us any. Order was over $30 & could not break our $100. I've been in customer service for 3 years & that just wasn't acceptable. No name tag, sweater was zipped up over his uniform. Just very unprofessional. Made us go to the bank to break it & have no compensation for the time wasted. Won't be back for a while. & not to mention it's hailing outside."}
{"text":"Worst Papa Johns ever. Not once but a few times, I've ordered pizza from this location, and it's either been cold, or uncooked every single time. Done giving chances. If you want pizza delivered, order from anywhere but here. You're better off going to 711"}
{"text":"Very rude and poor service. Attempted to order pizza for delivery and they told me it was going to take 2 hours!! 2 hours? Are you serious? & when I called to ask why it was going to be taking so long they were rude and said \"cause we're busy\". I totally understand that you can be busy but it should NOT take 2 hours for pizza. This is unacceptable. Consider hiring more drivers then!"}
{"text":"This pizza place is near my place, good for late night bites. The crust is genuinely tasty and comes with a free dip that comes in handy. I got 'The Works' with sausage, bacon, green peppers, onions, pepperoni and cheese which was overall pretty good, they could have added more cheese though. The wings were tasty but absolutely drenched in BBQ sauce. Overall would recommend checking it out if you live nearby."}
{"text":"I love papa johns...but this location is pretty bad. We placed an order for carry out for a special that was online only! Pizza was ready in 20 minutes but was very Luke warm. They must make pizza in 5 minutes. One of the pizzas was wrong so I had to drive back to get the right one. No apologies made. Almost a contempt for me returning the pizza. This is the 3rd time in a row with poor attitudes in general with papa johns. I recommend any place else. Go with quality over speed. Sorry Papa John, but u need a new business model other than garlic butter"}
{"text":"***ATTN FOOD RESTRICTIONS AND ALLERGIES*** Very disappointed with this Papa Johns location so much that if I could rate zero stars I would. I just ordered two pizzas with a 50% off coupon. One pepperoni and one vegetarian Alfredo pizza. I ordered the pizza and once I arrived to pick up the pizzas they were cold leaving the store but I decided I jut wanted to get home and eat.  When I got home the pizza was not cut properly (couldn't even pull he slices apart). The pepperoni wasn't to bad other than having to microwave it before it was able to eat when we just picked it up from the store!  But to start the actual rant the vegetarian pizza, keep in mind VEGETARIAN, had little pieces of ham throughout the pizza. My daughter who has been a vegetarian for eight years and my grandson who has been vegetarian his whole life for two years now and never eaten meat got ham on their pizza.  When I called the store to inform them of the cross contamination issue they accused me of lying and tried to say I cut my own ham and put it on the pizza because the pizza boy knows he didn't put any ham on the pizza. This just tells you how filthy the work station is for there to be cross contamination and the worst part is they didn't show any sympathy for this could make other my daughter and grandson very sick.   If you have any allergies or food restrictions I highly recommend that you choose a different pizza joint."}
{"text":"I have had bad experience after bad experience at this location. It is a a disgrace to the entire Papa Johns chain. I love papa johns pizza. I have been a loyal,  die hard papa johns customer for over 18 years and this location has COMPLETELY turned me off papa johns as a customer. I have left multiple complaints on this site about poor service and clearly no one cares about the crappy service this store consistently provides. Zero improvments in service over the course of 2 years. Slow delivery, under cooked pizza and even with a pick up order, when the app says my pizza is ready for pick up, they tell me \"5 more minutes\" when i try to pick it up.  If this is Papa Johns \"quality\" it sucks. No more chances. I work too hard for my money to be wasting it at a crappy restaurant like this. This would be negative if i could."}
{"text":"2nd time ordering online and both times late late late.....  they say 30-40 min.....  what a joke....  cold pizza and waiting way too long!  More like cold pizza an hour or more later.  Gave them a 2nd chance and what a joke...  maybe the prepaid tip wasn't good enough even though more than 25% each time!  Maybe no prepaid tip would make them faster!  Ha!  maybe not.  Whatever!  10 minutes in the oven to make the pizza edible... chicken wings luke warm too...  :(    Take n bake here I come!"}
{"text":"Less than one mile from my house. I like papa john's thin pizza. It's crispy and fresh."}
{"text":"I put in my order over 35 min ago when it said it would be ready in 15 min. The associates were very rude and told me they would hurry but did not any they didn't even give me a discount or anything. They didn't even say sorry. Never going here again."}
{"text":"New manager is on top of it now. Fewer mistakes and always accommodating. The staff seems friendlier and well trained. It is always clean. Watching the people toss the dough is fun for the kids. Great pizza every time."}
{"text":"We tried to order a pizza 15 minutes before they closed and they would not deliver or take pick up. An owner of a restaurant (a chain or not) would most likely want to take the business of a customer. Especially if they stopped ordering from us because of the situation. If the customer paid monthly about $20 a month for 12 months is $240 annually x 5 customers is $1200 a year. I worked at daves comic subs for 6 years, we had customers order before close and we complained but we still served them. This place is pathetic."}
{"text":"Rude and very bad customer service. I went in to order a pizza with a coupon that I bought off line from Allstate rewards and the man that worked tonight ( black shirt dark hair) was very rude and disrespectful. I've never met so many people who work with the public and has no skills, in doing so. Very sad!!!! I can't wait to move so I don't have to come here when my children wants pizza."}
{"text":"Never had a problem with their pizza or delivery service. It's their own brand and recipe, so I guess you either like it or you don't!"}
{"text":"This experience was probably the worse one by far. I call to place my order. I speak to Jaliviah who no only ask me to repeat my number three times. Doesn't remember my order the first time I give it to her or even the fact that I asked for it to be delivered. So after having to repeat myself at least 5 times to her I'm annoyed. At the end of talking in slow motion for her. I ask her to repeat my order to which she messes up . We hang up and I call back just to verify she got it right, and hopefully talk to someone a bit more competent. Afer that annoying holding recording. Someone picks up and doesn't say a word, they hang up. I call back ( The photo below) and Guess who answers? Jaliviah. I ask to speak to the manager and she places me on hold again. After waiting on hold for 15 min. I decided to just drive down there. After waiting to be acknowledge after 5min. I finally ask for the manager Eric. He doesn't bother to come speak to me. Another young lady does, she ask if anyone's helped me and I explain I'm waiting for the manager. She takes ownership of the situation and ask what's wrong. I tell her at this point I just want my money back...All the while. My on hold phone call is RINGING. I'm in the store and I'm on HOLD and it's RINGING and no one even looks towards the phone. The manager never comes to speak to me. No one ever picks up the phone. Below is how long I was on hold before just saying for get it. You don't mess with peoples food, time and money. They clearly have a lack of customer service. I'm surprised they are still running."}
{"text":"Nothing special to note about this location of the Papa John's chain.  They generally perform reasonably well, and most times you will notice that they are staffed well enough to handle things - but you will also typically notice that the staff ends up using this to their disadvantage.  The last time we were there to pick up a pizza (which was paid for online, so they just needed to look at it and pull it off the rack), three people took several minutes looking at another order - for a customer who was not standing there waiting for their order."}
{"text":"I decided to give this papa Johns a try. John would be embarrassed by how awful this location is. I'm not sure if they own pizza cutters here because both of my large pizzas weren't even cut. I had to use my chainsaw to cut my pizza. Got all over the walls :( also had to wait an hour for my pizzas to be ready. I also had to go get my lawnmower to blow off all the grease on my pizza. What a shame, really wanted to like this place. Oh well, at least there's still Dominos :)"}
{"text":"Dear Papa Johns: Thank you so much for raising your prices, for taking the double cut option off your online ordering, and for being out of spices when I pick up my pizza. With that extra buck per pizza you're now charging, is it too much to ask to have basic \"Papa Johns Special Seasoning\" in stock? Surely your managers or whomever does the online ordering can click the little onscreen box in order to ship some of the seasoning packets to the store.    As for taking double cut off the options, sure I can still ask for it at the store, but why can't I just click the box and make it clear what it is that I want?  But as for the price increase? I can't thank you enough. Settebello charges $12 for their basic masterpieces. Your price increase, drop in quality, and lack of having basic spices means Settebello and other pizza places are now in play for our business. I can steer my family towards higher quality local choices!    Tack on a we don't give a dang attitude at the store last night and you get a dropped 2 stars boot to the keister with the follow up review.   Oh and the 2 year old spit out your cheese sticks. That is an EPIC FAIL!"}
{"text":"If I could I give NO stars I would. Ordered online, took 1 hour and 4 minutes to get my cold pizza! I'm so hungry I've been willing to use the microwave! That's obsurd! The garlic knots are burned, and garlic oil leaked all over both boxes. My kitchen is a mess! NEVER AGAIN!!"}
{"text":"One star because I can't tell you if the pizza is any good because every time I call they put me on hold.  First time 10min so figured they forgot I was on hold. So Hung up &  called back when they asked if they could put me on hold I said no &  they put me on hold anyway."}
{"text":"Called on a monday at 11:08 am to order 1 small pizza. It literally took til 11:13 for me to place my order. That is crazy to be on the phone that long to order one small pizza!! After he told me my order, he told me it was gonna be 45 minutes to an hour til the pizza is ready. Keep in mind this is for a PICK UP order and not delivery. That is so crazy considering it's a monday morning! I asked him if he was serious and he said in a real sly tone \"Yeah, we busy.\"  No way are they that busy that early in the mornings. I know some Papa John's pizza are busy that mornings to prep to sell some pizzas to their local schools for lunch but schools were closed this day. Ridiculous."}
{"text":"I was running errands and stumbled across this location. It's a newer location and I LOVE that they have drive thru! I ordered online a large pizza. I made it to this location in about 10 minutes and went to the drive thru. I was greeted immediately by the sweetest girl! I don't know what her name was but this was this past Wednesday night. She told me it would be a few minutes. I waited a while. I noticed another car was waiting behind me. I wasn't sure what to do so I asked a guy that walked by the window if i should move my car since there is another car behind me and he said no. I waited a few more minutes and got my pizza. The girl handed it to me with a huge smile on her face. This is a very friendly location and I will keep it in mind when I'm on the go."}
{"text":"I would give them a zero if I could!!! Do yourself a favor...just stop at the Harris teeter on your way home and grab a frozen pizza! Per their app my pizza was in \"boxing\"  for over 45 minutes!"}
{"text":"The staff may need some More guidance from management. I came to the store in person to place my order. One pizza, one side of cheese sticks. I sat at the little bench next to the counter to wait until my order was done. 25 minutes went by and no one said anything. So I ask if my order is ready and it takes 2 people to find my order. Then they realize they didn't make the cheese sticks....i just don't get it. It's pretty simple and I was literally in the store the entire time. YIKES."}
{"text":"I wanted a menu here, So just dropped in, but unfortunately they gave me a menu insolently. And unpleasant look that the staff of the old woman seemed to get angry. It was disregard even if I said thank you. I was made feel very unpleasant by her. It was just an imperious manner. I thought did I do something wrong with them?! Unfortunately, I definitely won't order a pizza here."}
{"text":"Last night was my first time in 32-years having Papa John's pizza.  I never knew much about them until this season watching the NFL and last night I broke down and had to go pick one up.  I'm glad I did.  I ordered 8 of the buffalo chicken wings and a large pepperoni and black olive pizza....it was good!  I say \"delish\" but I HATE THAT word...but I just used it...agh!  Anyways, it was great pizza.  The chicken wings were not the greatest I've ever had but they weren't bad.  I would never go their just for the wings but I will definitely go back for pizza.  It was fun waiting for it in the lobby because everyone seemed to be having fun and laughing.  Customer service was great!"}
{"text":"Not good for business delivery. Put in a delivery on the internet for a business location for a working lunch. They don't include plates, forks, napkins, etc. that would be needed if you are not at home. They are RUDE on the phone and don't want to correct it when called on it. Their salads look like they were bought off a grocery store shelf and contained flimsy forks that broke. Prices too high for the quality for sure."}
{"text":"Get delivery from this place. We were in a church running some dance show and not only did he get here early, when my phone wasn't getting the texts he walked around for ten minutes asking for me until a friend texted me he was here. Big tip game. Big delivery game. Kudos baby"}
{"text":"We had a Birthday party for my niece across the street and ordered $60 worth of pizza. We had to pay with multiple cards and the GM running the store was so accommodating. As for the food, come on guys it's Papa Johns. It was hot and tasted like Papa Johns should always taste, so I was happy. I would go back to this location because of the service received."}
{"text":"Went with friends for carry out orders. Was my first time trying PJ, it was actually delish. The guy in store was nice too. Will be back."}
{"text":"I'm not the biggest fan of Papa johns pizza. I prefer Pizza Hut if we are going the pizza route. However the great thing about papa johns is that they offer great deals ALL THE TIME! They always offer specials. The location is very close to Lawson and Cureton subdivisions so if you live in one of those places, you will most likely find this one of the most convenient pizza shops."}
{"text":"i dont understand why all the bad reviews? i had an ez time online order and carry out was good!"}
{"text":"Last time going to this place ! There large looks like a medium :/ very disappointed !! Definitely sticking to Pizza Hut."}
{"text":"This is the absolute worst papa johns to order from. Expect your food to be jacked up! Its closer to my house but its the most inconvenience ever. Team members are rude and my pizza is always wrong or thrown together. Last night i ordered breadsticks with my pizza and they were all different sizes and just not presentable. The time before that i ordered all veggies and had sausage on some pieces and im vegetarian. Im never ordering from here again. They are horrible."}
{"text":"We ordered a pizza and wings for the FIRST and LAST time from this store.  We had a very busy day and decided to try a pizza from Papa Johns on 35th Ave. and Northern.  We ordered on line (rather than from our 'regular' pizza place).  I ran to the grocery store and then stopped to pick up our delicious hot 'freshly' made pizza.  The two men at the front stated that we had not ordered a pizza from them and \"checked\" other stores in case I made a mistake.  Sorry fellas...got back home and guess the freak what.....;.I did order from that location, we checked online under our \"account\" and yep....our pizza and wings were oredered from them......I was made to feel like an idiot !  We will NEVER again order from this store.   We order pizzas about once per week....but not from Papa Johns......"}
{"text":"You know the expression 3 strikes and you're out, after 3 times of bad orders, delivery problems and non-existent customer service when you complain this chain (not only the location) are off my list for a very long time!  Ordered on multiple occasions, each time there is an issue, after a while of issues you eventually have to give up and go elsewhere and that was the case tonight, another order, another mistake, another driver that can't be bothered to do anything, a girl on the phone that doesn't care about how she gets her paycheck because her idea of customer service is putting you on hold until you give up and based on my last call to the daytime manager, that will go nowhere!   For a company that needs money to buy those high dollar sporting event ads, apparently this franchise isn't going to be paying in to corporate as much as they should because under-performance will eventually kill their numbers.   Maybe corporate will read this and secret shop this location HINT HINT HINT!!!"}
{"text":"Quick, clean, and efficient. Placed an order online for pickup and it was ready and made exactly to order. Nice to get what you expect, no?"}
{"text":"Have to say they always get my order right, on time and very tasty. Unfortunately they charge $4.00 now for delivery which I think is too much. Seems greedy. I'll continue to use this location but I don't agree with the delivery charge."}
{"text":"Ordered a large vegetable pizza, an 8 piece of buffalo wings and an 8 piece of bbq wings. Cost $34 and the pizza was 50%.... so over priced when each wing is about $1. The worst part? The sauce didn't stick to the wings at all and a good 1/3 of them didn't have meat on the whole bone Including 2 that we're just a bone... I have never been so unimpressed by pizza in my life. I would recommend Sardellas pizza."}
{"text":"Pizza sauce is sweet.On time with orders.Trying online, carry-out.Will have food4 the week w/$8.99 Large Specialty deals or build your own."}
{"text":"1 star only because I like pizza. My girlfriend ordered late night and asked politely, \"can you hold on for 30 seconds?\" The person on the phone responded \"we close in one minute. If you don't order now we won't put your order in.\" I get it - it was a last minute order and your employees wanted to get out of there. But customer service is not about \"getting out of there.\" it's about getting customers what they need and pay for. Being rude is fine, I can handle that. But when we got our pizza and bread sticks, the pizza was very undercooked and wet, and the bread sticks tasted like domino's before they revamped their image. Nevermind the fact that the person on the phone said order now or never, we ordered a medium 2 topping pizza and bread sticks from $20. The only reason my girlfriend said wait 30 seconds is because I was checking online for a deal. I could have gotten twice as much for the same price.   I sincerely hope management reads this review, simply for the purposes of teaching employees their MANORS. this happened right before close on Sunday, April 23, 2016. Good day, and good luck. (at least the delivery driver was nice)  EDIT:  Got a very nice letter in the mail from a managing partner at Papa John's.  Was very courteous and I appreciated it very much.  He gave a generous gift card and apologized for the service.  I applaud your management team! (increased stars)."}
{"text":"Another 5 stars to Gwen and her team at Papa John's Pizza on Buffalo and Alta!!! Spoke to Gwen about my previous order and I found out one of the mistakes was my own mistake when ordering online. (FYI make sure the sizes you select for the BOGO are correct before sending your order.   They have been so awesome that I done forgot what my issue was in the first place!!  Thanks again to our drive,  Jennifer for coming back to see us again!!"}
{"text":"If I could give negative stars I would!  It seems like every single order from this location is messed up in one way or another!  I don't want free food.  I want my order to arrive when promised and be warm and correct.  Even the remade orders are wrong.  After being a VERY long time Papa Johns lover (20 years +) I'm going to have to sadly part ways.  You've let me down and I've given you SO many chances!"}
{"text":"Great location with excellent service and food. Pizza always is super-tasty at this location. Try the wings.   Everything delicious."}
{"text":"If you provide a time frame with expectations of when to expect delivery of your service then as a customer I expect the service to be provided. My food was delivered late and I just don't feel the company should give time frames they can't keep! False advertising and I get cold food"}
{"text":"So I am not sure why but twice now we have gotten undercooked pizza. Both times I got sick. If you order the thin crust it's fine. But both times it was bad it was an XL regular crust with extra cheese. The same employee was working both times so maybe he just undercooks. I am so done with this location."}
{"text":"WOW, I was reading all the bad reviews on line and they are pretty disturbing and I don't blame customers for being upset!  I to had a few bad experiences with rudeness and one of the times my pizza being cold. That being said, my 5 star review is based mostly on 1 employee, Kevin!   We moved to Nevada almost 2 months ago, coming from a small town that had only one choice for pizza, Domino's.  Although Domino's ok, it, in my opinion, is not as good as Pappa Johns!  So we were thrilled when we moved in the neighborhood by Pappa Johns.  3x the entire first week we were here, we ordered Pappa Johns while we unpacked! U would hav thought we just discovered pizza, LOL.  Each time I called I was lucky enough to get a young man by the name of Kevin.  I told him we just moved and he actually welcomed me to the neighborhood and thanked me for ordering from them.  He was pleasant, professional and did in fact tell me that delivery was running 45 minutes.  He gave me the option of picking it up if that was better.  I asked if I wait 45, will the pizza be cold?  He said \"No\" and would personely oversee the order and if for some reason it was, he would send another or compensate me.  Call me Silly, but how much more can u ask for than that!  Well, the pizza's were there in 38 minutes, piping hot and delicious!  The next 2 times, the same and Kevin actually remembered me and asked how the house was coming! Unfortunately, the next few times I called, I did not get Kevin!  These particular employees were just not friendly and seemed to not want to be there.  On one of my calls, I could hear a female in the background talking firmly and literally putting down another employee!  I asked the call taker if that was his supervisor in the background and he was VERY hesitant to answer, so I immediately dropped it.  If that was the supervisor, no wonder they don't want to be there!  On top of that, my order was wrong one time and cold the next!  However, tonight, I called and specifically asked for Kevin, Way good for me he was there!!  I thanked him profusely for his GREAT customer service and told him about my last 2 experiences.  He apologized, thanked me for still placing orders and compensated me for the 2 pizza's!!  I got the pizza's in 40 minutes, they were hot and the BEST!!  Thank you Kevin and I hate to do this to U, but I am going to tell all my neighbors to ask for you!!"}
{"text":"Papa John's is always so much better than Dominos or Pizza Hut. If you're vegan it's easy to still get a great tasting pizza. Regular crust,  no cheese,  extra sauce and whatever vegetables you like."}
{"text":"Ordered online off the app at 10pm Saturday night. The pizza came quick it was hot and fresh and the damn XL was only 9.99 I'll be backkkkkkk"}
{"text":"I stopped ordering from this place. Had to send back cold pizza after driver took 90 mins to deliver. Horrible service! So many better options than papa johns."}
{"text":"This particular Papa Johns is disgusting and made me sick! I ordered bbq wings and a spinach Alfredo pizza at 6:30. Delivery est. 7:06pm. Delivery tracker displayed delivered and completed by 7:10 but there was never a delivery. I called store and they said tracker was incorrect but delivery driver would be leaving store with order soon. It arrived around 7:35. The pizza was super cold and wings did not taste like bbq, tasted like a made up honey buffalo sauce. I called back and requested a replacement order. They delivered that around 8:40. The pizza was cold again  (not as cold but not warm) and the wings sauce was terrible again. I've gotten bbq sauce wings from different papa John's and this was the ONLY location I've received this terrible made up sauce. Idk if it was spoiled or what but I ended my night throwing up and wasting my money because I couldn't even eat the food. Terrible!"}
{"text":"Tasteless cheap pizza. There are so many options in central phoenix so why go with a company that uses its sub par pizza chain as a political tool. Maybe if the pizza was decent the CEO would have some credibility in criticizing obamacare?  but the pizza sucks."}
{"text":"If I could give this location a zero I would, the last 3 orders I placed with this store they all were wrong. The last two times I ordered and the order was wrong the employee told me I could place the order again and they will give me a discount, not replace the order for free which they should've because they fucked up the order in the first place. Very disappointing because I actually like papa john pizza. I just ordered again tonight for them to get the order wrong once again and ASHLEY (the manager) told me she doesn't even see my order in the system which is complete bulshit. Finally she told me she was going to send another order (the correct order) but I never received anything. I had to call corporate because the employees are beyond ridiculous. HORRIBLE CUSTOMER SERVICE, don't ever order from this location again and ASHLEY needs to be FIRED......."}
{"text":"This is the closest to me and this is the location that sends my delivery orders. I like that I can ask for special treatment. I like my crust crispy and it comes that way without being burned  The veggies are fresh and evenly spread on the pizza They always are honest and accurate with the delivery times I've only had a bad pizza once and they quickly remade it and delivered it Personal preference and customer happiness is alive here"}
{"text":"Didn't disappoint! After a long day it hit the spot. The cashier was kind of rude though. I also ordered an extra garlic butter they forgot to give me so check your box."}
{"text":"After a long day I decided to order pizza. I ordered my regular which is a John's favorite pizza and an order of garlic breadsticks. As always, the breadsticks were amazing. They were hot and fresh and full of flavor. The pizza on the other had was extremely bland and the crust almost seemed like it wasn't cooked all the way. The sauce on the pizza had no flavor and sausage was either old or just not seasoned properly. I ended up eating one piece and throwing away the rest. Definitely an upsetting way to end a long day. Thankfully I had breadsticks to eat. Hopefully this was just a one time thing but makes me hesitant to order from this location again. I hope papa johns isn't trying to cut corners and buy cheaper products. If they are it definitely shows and they will begin to lose customers. Papa Johns is known for quality and consistency and this order definitely fell short. Don't change what's not broken!!"}
{"text":"Good pizza. The delivery time was a little long but overall thumbs up. I have used them before and im sure i will again soon. Thanks guys"}
{"text":"What can I say? I'm a sucker for any place that has an app or website order option so I don't have to talk to an actual person on the phone.  This has been my Papa John's location for over a year now. I've never had any issues with delivery. My order is always correct. Tonight, I got caught in the monsoon as I was leaving the nail salon next door, so I decided to go get a pizza. Everyone inside was so nice, including all the delivery drivers who had to go back and forth in the rain.  When it comes to a pizza chain option, this is my usual for delivery. Make sure to check the website for specials. They also have deals when the Hornets score a certain number of points. Papa John's also does reward points, so make sure to create an account online."}
{"text":"the manager named Aiden is a real fuck he says he'l remake the pizzas he askes what's my number and name and then tells me it wiI be 20 minutes and I call and tell him my brother is coming there and  He says about that he doesn't see my order and doesn't wanna replace my order The manager named Aiden is a confusing fuck shit for brains"}
{"text":"2nd ---Patricia has to be the worst manager on the Earth  besides having my pizza wrong I called they said they would make it 35 minutes later I went back there and brought them the pizzas that were wrong   then they didn't have the new ones made that I wanted  so I asked her to just give me my money back  she said she will do it later write the number down    I have no pizza Papa John's has my money absolutely ridiculous unprofessional I will never ever come here again 1st   ----First time trying this place I know what to expect as far as the taste of the pizza but I didn't expect that both pizzas were going to be made WRONG! Really ? Drive all the way there...then home...BOO WRONG! double check your pizza before you leave this place not a good first impression at all"}
{"text":"Even though they had a full team they were running way behind. I ordered for carry out took a nap and still had to wait inside for over 30 minutes. I'm writing this review as I'm still waiting. The employees are trying to speed up orders of customers that are waiting inside but it's a shame to have to wait for so long. Not sure of the pizza quality or taste yet but the time issue is the reason they are getting only 2 stars."}
{"text":"I just called into this location to order 1 large pizza with pepperoni and mushroom and they said it was $17.00 for a pizza!  Are you kidding me, it's a fast food pizza!  No thanks papa johns, your competitors down the street are just fine!  Ridiculous!"}
{"text":"Kevin makes the pizza perfect every single time for us. Thank You for taking care of us every single time we come in."}
{"text":"I used to love Papa John's pizza a lot. This is our neighborhood store and for the past several years we have ordered both take out and delivery from them. The pizza has been okay - not the best. The other night we had to be somewhere at 7:30 (on a Tuesday) and ordered delivery from them at 6:00. An email said the pizza would be here in 20-30 minutes. At 6:45 we called to ask where the pizza was and at 7:15 it still wasn't here so we cancelled it since we had to leave and were already late. At 7:25 the guy showed up with the pizza. We told the guy we cancelled it and he left. If you are on a time schedule and want pizza from this Papa John's order early."}
{"text":"I arrived as the only customer in the restaurant.  I was ignored by everyone working- I was standing right in front of the register. It wasn't until two other customers walked in about 5 minutes after me that somebody finally acknowledged me. I had placed my order 25 minutes prior and was told it would be ready in 15 to 25 minutes. I gave them my name, they walked over and my pizza was sitting there but they told me it would be another 10 minutes until my bread sticks were ready. No only was my order was not ready when they said it would be, when I finally did receive it I got a cold pizza and warm bread sticks. This was 8 p.m. on a Friday night, and there were 7 people working  minue the delivery drivers that were coming and going. While I was waiting apparently a shift change happened and then no communication was made that I was still waiting for my order!!!"}
{"text":"It's probably the worst Papa John's I've ever been to. Every time we order something, they have forgotten to give us part of it, messed up the order, or they forget to place our order and when I arrive there it's not ready. I've been there at least four times and given them multiple opportunities to fix these problems, but they never do. You're better off ordering from a different restaurant. I love Papa John's, but this one franchise is subpar and has poorly trained staff."}
{"text":"This team is fantastic!  I had trouble with the new Papa Johns app on my iPhone and the manager personally fixed it. Great people, great fun, great pizza."}
{"text":"One of the favorite spots. They make our vegetable n cheese pizza according to the demand with lot of jalapeño n extra cheese on top. Right on time and excellent customer service. Nice n friendly staff."}
{"text":"I ordered a side of garlic knots with my pizza order. When I received my order my garlic knots were burnt. I promptly called the store and advised them of the situation and they promised to send another order out shortly. This was close to 11pm and not long before them closing however they promised my order. I realized that after about 30 minutes the replacement order never arrived. But they were now closed. No one bothered to call or show up with my replacement order. I called today to replace the order and they had no explanation why the service was so bad and why my order was not sent as promised. I did get my replacement order but nothing more was offered to help rectify the error ... not even an apology. I will never order from this location again"}
{"text":"This place gets an automatic 3 starts for not being a Pizza 73.   Having avowed never to willingly consume the cardboard monstrosities being passed off as pizzas from that oddly numbered establishment ever again, I opted for a \"John's Favorite\" from good ol' PJ's.  Delivery time was adequate. Pizza arrived hot. So far, so good.  It was pretty good - much better crust - the added bonus of a little packet of garlic butter for me to toss in my gullet and a jalapeno that I always eat directly in front of any women present so they know just how manly and no-care ever I really am.  Papa John's isn't the best pizza out there, but as far as delivery goes it's a pretty safe bet. Way above pizza hut, miles above Pizza 73 - but its no Atlas or Coco Brooks.  3.5 stars."}
{"text":"If I could give it a zero I would! First -I placed n online order and didn't click the necessary pick up time -so I called the location directly and asked if they could just wait an hour to make the pizza! I was told that they didn't have the capability to do this and that I would have to start over with the online process! REALLY -we have advanced so far in technology that you can't pull and order manually and place it in the que for 45 minutes later? REALLY-I have to start over? Then I redid the order and put the new time in for 6pm! When I arrived at papa johns the receipt showed that the pizza was placed up on the heater at 530-so it was cold!  Now I have to wait for my first order, which was cancelled to be refunded and they already have my money from the 2nd order!"}
{"text":"If you want cold pizza that takes an hour to deliver with rude customer service then this is your place. Pizza wasn't made the right way, took forever (long enough to warrant two phone calls), and was cold. Had to reheat in my oven since I have no faith they would remake the order. Beyond disappointed and will never order from this location again."}
{"text":"If there were a rating lower than one star they would get it. Worst experience with papa johns EVER. Received my pizza LOADED with mushrooms, asked for them to help me out with a new and the dude was a complete douchebag with absolutely no customer service. Any other place would've gladly made me a new one. I even offered to pick the new one up. Lucky I don't slap him with this pizza."}
{"text":"This is NOT a review of the employees but for the awful working conditions of the employees!   I went to pick up an online order and it was 98 degrees INSIDE the store. We asked how long the AC had been broken and the nice employee said AROUND A WEEK! It's been OVER 100 degrees every day.   FOR SHAME on management.  I wrote to corporate.    Awesome employees however."}
{"text":"I live close by and am very cheap. That's why I love this place. When any local professional team wins you get half off your pizza if you order online and use the code they give you. That works out to about $7 for an XL specialty pizza. Or you can get a one topping pizza on crust that tastes like cardboard at Little Caesars down the street. The choice is obvious to me.   The staff has gone out of their way twice to help me. Once they were getting slammed and my order was delayed by 10 minutes. They let me know and doubled the amount of chicken I ordered as a side. They also have me all my dipping sauces for free. I wasn't expecting that and was impressed.  Another time I had leftover pizza from ordering papa johns at work the day before. I stopped to get some of their awesome garlic sauce to go with it. I guess they weren't open yet but the lady that was out front asked what I needed. When I told her just sauce she just went in and got some and gave to me. I appreciated that a lot as it made my lunch that day much better.   They always have good deals and they have Pepsi products. This location has great customer service to boot. What's not to love?"}
{"text":"Like so many others on here, I have to give 1 star to leave a review. After the last couple of orders of garlic knots I've ordered being over cooked (burnt), I guess I figured that if I asked specifically for them to be cooked for a less amount of time, that they would get the hint that I did not want them burnt again. Nope. Still burnt. Still totally frustrated that even having to wait 10 min in their store that they would actually do them right. When I expressed my disappointment in the outcome, I immediately got attitude about it. Another 15 min they wanted to re make the knots. Forget it, I'll just give them to a homeless person. Will not spend anymore time and money at this location. Hopefully after enough negative reviews, corporate will get wind of the crappy products coming out of this location and fix something."}
{"text":"ALWAYS a wonderful pizza experience.  Fast Delivery. Speedy Pick-Up. Friendly Staff. All around great Papa Johns"}
{"text":"this place is a joke!!!! worst service ever, pizza was so burned the sauce wasn't ever red it was almost brown && you couldn't tell what the toppings were (pepperoni, sausage & mushrooms) ....  when we called them the alex gave ever excuse under the sun, lorna then got on the phone with more excuses ( she claimed to be the manager) but then the nick gets on the phone and says hes the manager and says its a pan pizza thats how its supposed to look man!! we told him the crust was so hard it nearly cracked my moms dentures he said he didn't know why??!! even the underside if the pizza was black not brown but burned to a crisp!!!!!  they all lie, make excuses, and rudely blame the customer for thier mistakes!!! save yourself a headache and grab a take & bake!!!! undercover boss needs to pop in on them!!!!!"}
{"text":"Reading all the reviews below, I feel confused.  I've used this PJ's for delivery for a few years and have never had an issue.  I guess you can't get attitude from the manager when you order online, but I've never had an excessive wait and no mistaken orders.  I guess I must be lucky.  Also, PJ's is the ONLY chain that actually puts extra sauce on a pizza if you request it.  Overall, this place is fine."}
{"text":"This place is a mess.  Called on Saturday evening 6:20 PM.  10 minutes on hold, hung up.  Called back and ordered 2 pizzas.  At 8:00 no pizza so a I called back, manager tells me they see that I ordered, but whoever took the order didn't hit the send button.  Uhhh, ok.  Puts me on hold, after 10 minutes I hang up.  I call back, no apology, but took the order again and said they'd rush it out in 25 minutes.  An hour later no pizza, I call back.  They have no record of my order.  Manager doesn't know who I am.  I tell him what happened and that I had talked to the manager, he tells me they have different manager.  He asks if I want to reorder, I can tell that this is actually the manager and he does apologize.  No pizza that night.  I've ordered from this place dozens of times over the years and never had a problem, but something has changed."}
{"text":"Tonight one of there drivers came flying down our street full of kids. My husband called the manager who didn't seem to care that he could've killed children playing In a culdasac."}
{"text":"I read the other reviews first, but reviews are opinions so I thought I'd find out myself.  I ordered online which was simple, I watched an animated process (in between news) and it was delivered very timely, exactly as ordered. The driver was a nice clean cut young man who handed off a delicious pizza and brownies...and root beer of course. I have ordered Domino's since I bought a place here, and I'm switching to Papa John's.  I did not experience the negative doo-doo the other reviewer's have...I own my own business which causes me to have to order out occasionally, and this was perfect for me. I recommend this store."}
{"text":"I've had pizza from here a few times now, and its pretty good.  I've ordered online twice and carried out once, and two of the three times, the pizza was really good.  The one time I carried out the pizza tasted a bit undercooked. It just didn't taste right at all.  The staff here is friendly, and the delivery times are fairly quick.  In regards to the competition, I have to say, Papa John's ranks a bit higher then the others.  It's not the worst pizza I've , but I actually kind of like it.    I will probably order from them again, and their food isn't half bad."}
{"text":"I wish I could give this place zero stars. My friends and I ordered pizza at 10:23pm, it is now 12:43am and they still have not shown. Called them at 11:30  and they said their driver called but we did not answer. Called again at 12:30, once again they said they had called. It's a nice night so we have been sitting outside the entire time and no one has shown up in front of the building we are at. WE ARE STILL WAITING ON ONE LARGE PIZZA TO ARRIVE HERE. The person that we talked to on the phone said that they would call their driver to find out what is going on. At this point we are all starving and ready to kill a man. This place will never get business from me again."}
{"text":"was good they had a special on medium pies so i went here because it was the closest staff was pretty cool i would go their again"}
{"text":"Zero stars. Worst manager ive rver tried to deal with. Never got my order. Called to speak with manager he cowarded behind his crew giving me the run around. Never again"}
{"text":"Ya I agree with most the reviews. I give this place yep 0 but won't let you post unless I put one stars. I have been in mountains edge for 9 years and the place is the same. The owner does not care if managers lie cuss and scream at their customers then when you call the corporate Papa John's office they fill you with more lies. Never ever order from this place."}
{"text":"Nevermind papa johns sucks. there's no consistency. Jennifer is great but the rest of the staff are the worst. who trains theses people??? they don't listen, they don't help, they don't do shit. they don't even make good pizza.  Sean is a prime example of trash management that give papa johns a horrible name."}
{"text":"After my last order was incorrect, (who orders BBQ sauce on a supreme?) I wasn't gonna order from them again, but with that failed order, I found out I had a free pizza with my points!  So I order my free three topping pizza online...  10 min later my phone rings and they inform me they have no Mushrooms, Ok, I can deal with that. 75 min later, not 30-40 like the email said, the pizza girl shows up...  says its 11$ and change...  I paid online with my credit card, due to only having 14$ cash on me!  she says I didn't!  so I go back and empty my wallet...  5$ was gonna be her tip, but she got 3$ and change...  I look at my emails...  I did pay with credit card! call them up, the 13yo on the phone says I did pay with my credit card, and that it will take 48-72 hrs for it to show back up on my card!  No Sorry, No, let me run you some bread sticks in the next hr! I double paid for a free pizza!    I used to order from here all the time! but in the last 3-6 months this place went downhill faster than a hooker on Nellis!  Someone has turned this Papa's into a steaming pile of red sauce.... with no Mushroom! that you double pay for! With no reach around! or lube!"}
{"text":"Pizza was great. What I didn't really like is the service... the location I went to seemed dirty and people looked lazy. The girl who was making the dough kept playing on her phone then going back to the pizza. It's disgusting!!! Do you know how much germs are on your cellphone. Once I paid for the pizza I also saw her grab the money and then as I was walking out she went back to the pizza!!!"}
{"text":"Was not satisfied with the buffalo chicken pizza I ordered from here. It was mostly a thick layer of cheese some chicken and a swirl of barbecue sauce that was on top.  It was like a candy cane. With a peppermint striped running through it. In this case, it was the sauce. This ment that much of the Pizza had no bbq flavoring.  The Pizza itself did not look all that appetizing. As it look like the chicken on it was little bits and pieces of something you would find in the trash cans located in the back of a Planned Parenthood. So not exactly visually appetizing.  I had to melt the garlic sauce,  as it came in a jelly-like congealed state.   Adding to my experiences I had ordered on line. And some how, half my order was erased. So That ment no bread sticks.  And they wanted me to include the tip during the order process. Made me think. What if my tip was not large enough?  Would I find that very special secret sauce added to my order?  Good thing was that the pizza was delivered fast and the driver seemed like a nice hard working man.  Other then that. I was not happy with them."}
{"text":"Ordered a x-large half Pepperoni half sausage.   Worst pizza I ever had.   Hardly any meat,very little cheese and dry..   can't remember a pizza this bad.  Prob will not go back there.  They need a new cook."}
{"text":"Ordered a pizza said it would be delievered at 1130 its midnight so I call to ask if they are open she says no then I ask why my pizza is 15 mins late and she says idk and checks she says sorry your pizza is on its way and will be another 20 30 mins .... so they are givng me a pizza at 1230 in morning after it showed my pizza was done at 1130 ... I have now got a Luke warm pizza at best so limp when I picked up a slice everything slid of but the sauce and its cold ... I'm happy she says she will credit me two free pizza but let's see if she really did and it better be fresh and warm this time. I don't even wanna eat this pizza they sent to me ... over an hour late and sat in a warmer the hole time :/"}
{"text":"These guys always do a great job! We usually order carry out because they're right down the street and it saves us a couple bucks. Everyone I've dealt with at this location is friendly and professional. You're doing a great job guys! Keep it up!"}
{"text":"Worst. Service. Ever. We ordered 4 pizzas and one was wrong. It was supposed to be vegetarian and it came with chicken. When we called back it took over 30 minutes of arguing on the phone to get a new pizza sent over. We got hung up on TWICE after being told repeatedly that we were wrong, and that we received the right order! We had the online order confirmation right in front of us! They even had the audacity to ask us to email it to them as \"proof\"!!! Seriously no exaggeration here. All this over a cheap medium pizza! The customer service level was zero, I've honestly never had worse. Don't order from here!!"}
{"text":"I wouldn't write a review on a franchise unless it pissed me off. I prefer Papa John's pizza to Dominos or Pizza Hut (by far), but there are some major service issues that have made my five ordering experiences pretty irritating.  They can't find my house. It's not hard to find, I swear. It's a piece of cake, and a stone's throw from a major crossroad. They had once taken two hours to deliver a pizza, saying they tried to call me (they didn't), only to return to the store and bring it back once I called. Naturally, I was delivered a lukewarm pizza, but in the nicest way possible was told that it was *my* mistake.  Unacceptable, in the age of online ordering and GPS systems in our phones, there is no excuse for getting lost in what is essentially a three mile drive in a straight line.   Without complaining, I had received a coupon for a free large pizza. Apology accepted. Upon visiting the store, I got to keep the card *after* ordering because they gave me the wrong toppings. Suckers.  Also, they always take longer than the ETA, even in the middle of a weekday. Even now, I am waiting 70 minutes for a 30-40 minute order, and when I had called 15 minutes ago, was told it was on its way, but that construction was holding it up. Yes, there is construction, but you have taken this long in the past without it. Also, construction would not explain why it takes nearly an hour to produce one large pizza. I even tip nicely.  I enjoy Papa John's pizza, but unless my complaints are addressed, I will never order from this location again. I will encourage my friends to follow suit. RAWR."}
{"text":"Delivery was VERY fast and the delivery guy was really friendly. The thin crust was pretty good, but the original crust was extremely chewy and the toppings didn't taste very fresh. I usually order the same thing in Chicago and I've never had that kind of chewiness in a pizza crust from papa johns before."}
{"text":"I seriously wish I would have read the reviews before even considering this place. Obviously this location has major issues! Last night I ordered pizza at 8:51pm and called at 9:35pm because my order still had not been delivered. The guy that answered needs to improve his phone etiquette, he sounded like a complete idiot. When I called he said it would be on the way in 10 more minutes and that they had a 90 minute wait time! He even went ahead to tell me that it stated it online, & when I checked the wait time said 65-75 min not 90 minutes! Regardless of how long it would take, both of those wait times are ABSOLUTELY RIDICULOUS. I called back and canceled my order. I ended up calling Domino's and within 10 min they were already on their way to deliver my pizza. I will never order pizza from this location again."}
{"text":"Always great pizza and on time i really dont know why the reviews are so low maybe people complain too much for their own good"}
{"text":"Awful service!!!  The person couldn't get the information right.  Was told it would be 30 minutes for a small pizza and wings.  Showed up an hour later.  Rejected the order.  No stars and no more business from us!!"}
{"text":"Placed an online order for delivery  but an hour later, we decided to call to check the status of our order to only find out they never received it.  They said they would get right on it and have it delivered in 45 minutes... Screw that we said, we will pick it up (we would have canceled if it wasn't prepaid)  The employee said that would be fine, it will be ready in 30 minutes.....    Starving and upset, we decided to drive to Papa Johns early to give them intimidating, grumpy looks so perhaps we can get our pizza and bread sticks quicker.  Imagine our surprise though when we showed up 10 minutes later and our order was sitting done at the bottom of a pile of other finished orders.  We took it home and it was almost ice cold....   It probably had been sitting there for the last hour and a half...  Most laughable though was our breadsticks.  They were literally balls of bread, and not even two were consistent in shape.  Small were tiny meatball sized, while others were like long sausages, and over there was another that was square in shape.  They also had literally no seasoning, were burnt, and just dough that had been baked pourly in a pizza oven.  I have had Papa John's breadsticks before, and this was a joke...  I will not be going here again.  Pizza is average at best anyways when the service actually manages to be good."}
{"text":"Theeeee worst pizza I have ever had in my life!  First time trying Papa Johns and the last!  The pizza I picked up was not the one I ordered on the phone ! The mgr made me another one with the right toppings and burned the crust.. He gave me the \" mistake \" pizza and a free litter of soda.  So,  I got two pizzas and soda for 10 bucks... Not bad right?!  Nope... The pizza was so disgusting I threw them both away.. Having to go thru a drive thru for dinner after all that... To the owner you really need to re train ur employees and improve ur store ...should just be shut down"}
{"text":"I generally like Papa John's Pizza a lot... but not this place.   Pros: Its papa John's.  Cons: Late delivery (takes an hour to 1.5 hrs... although they promise less than an hour). Even carry out takes more than 30 minutes. Pizza usually are not warm enough. Rude behind the counter staff"}
{"text":"Awesome fast and friendly service. Great delivery person. Delivery was from the Watson buckeye location.  Great flavor and fresh ingredients."}
{"text":"This is the most terrible pizza I have ordered in a long time. The pizza showed up 20 min late, the delivery driver was rude and the pizza was so undercooked that it was pathetic. It looked as though it hadn't even been cooked. Upon calling the manager \"Cheyenne\" she told us she could send a new pizza OR give us our money back....not both. Lmao I found this hilarious. You mean to tell me you messed up a pizza and not only are you not giving me my money back but you are also going to make me wait an hour for another pizza? Pathetic. Poor excuse for a papa johns. I have been a lifetime customer of papa johns....this experience has made me never want to order from them again SPECIFICALLY this location and this manager (Cheyenne). Would never recommend to anyone. Do not go here!!!!!"}
{"text":"Ordered a pizza said it would be 45 min to an hour. Asked them to call when they pulled up out front and I would come out and get the pizza. An hour and 15 min later, no pizza. Called them and they said they wrote the number down wrong and wouldn't come back unless we re ordered and they said it would take another hour.  Never ordering from them again. They better refund the $!"}
{"text":"I really like the Pizza and Delivery from this store.  They have gone out of there way to take care of things I really appreciate that.  The Delivery Guy was so nice."}
{"text":"I understand why this has such horrible reviews they deserve them all ordered chicken with extra chicken couldn't find any chicken at all and cheese was not spread evenly and looked like crud"}
{"text":"Why am I reviewing this place?  Because upon arriving in Phoenix after a six hour drive and having a whole moving truck to unload, this place was a welcomed source of food for me and the entourage helping us to haul stuff into the new apartment.  The pizza itself was nothing really all that special.  In my opinion, Domino's actually tastes better, but the service was good, my wife likes the dipping sauce, and we all got perfectly serviceable food exactly when we needed it.  Thanks.  We'll get pizza here on occasion.  At least you can easily order here on an iPhone."}
{"text":"Tried them again and what do you know, it took over an hour to get the pizza and it came cold AGAIN this time the manager couldn't care less when I called to complain.       I would give them 1 star but Mike that talked to me on the phone was very understanding and help full. I ordered a  pizza tonight at 9:45pm. After my pizza  taking awhile I called at 10:43pm to see where it was and they told me they were very backed up and my pizza had just left for delivery. At 11:34 I called again to see because it had been 45 minutes and I only live 10 minutes away. Right after I called the pizza showed up cold and hard. I called to talk to them and they had informed me that it was cold because the delivery driver took 4 deliveries out at the same time and mine was the last to be delivered even though I was the first person to order."}
{"text":"I was extremely disappointed on my last visit here. I ordered a pizza well done and it wasn't. Plus, the wings were cold. I really have nothing else to say. Specific instructions are provided in the online order. I have no idea how an employee can screw that up.  Well done means well done which means the cheese is golden brown with a crunchy crust. It was the furthest thing from it. White cheese and soggy crust! I won't be coming back here again. The MWEs (Minimum Wage Earners) really need to step up their game! Many of them need to have a sense of urgency before they run their own jobs out of business."}
{"text":"Went to Vegas recently for a childhood friend's twenty-first birthday shindig. Our first night there the girls wanted to have ample time to get ready. The Venetian gave us the number of this Papa John's as a place that would deliver to the hotel lobby.   The person that took my order was courteous and patient. He reiterated what hotel guest service had already told us: they'll deliver it to the hotel lobby, but not your hotel room. It was a forty minute wait for two large pizzas, which was perfectly fine because my girlfriends wound up taking over two hours to get ready. Chomping away at delicious pizza kept me from bitching at them to hurry up.   I'll definitely have them deliver again during my next stay in Sin City."}
{"text":"If you're looking for low budget pizza meal, this is the way to go! Love their original crust, and fresh veggies. Phone order was quick and easy. Delivery was prompt."}
{"text":"The Pizza here is awful.  I have ordered individual slices occasionally and a medium pizza just once. They both had \"cardboard-like\" crust and I'm not a fan of the sweet tomato sauce. The pizza just isn't good tasting. Also, the delivery cars are an annoyance because there are so many of them and they take up a lot of space in the parking lot. (The previous pizza store location didn't have this problem)  Don't go here.....there are plenty alternatives in the area."}
{"text":"The pizza is always good.  The service is exceptional.  A delivery driver mistakenly took our carryout order and for our trouble the manager refunded our entire 2 pizzas price!  Love this store's staff!  Been there a lot and will continue to!!"}
{"text":"Papa John's pizza is definitely a change from the normal Pizza Hut or Domino's. But it's also not the best pizza I've ever had.  I always get delivery, which has been spot on. Even at times better than Pizza Hut.  But I have had hit and miss with this place. My last order I didn't even get what I ordered.  The best thing about Papa John's is that they are open late at night past midnight."}
{"text":"We always order from this Papa Johns instead of the one by our house because the service is so much better! The guys are always so nice, accommodating and they are just the best PAPA JOHNS over here in North Las Vegas!"}
{"text":"Pizza is terrible.... Point blank period. Too much cheese where is the pepperoni and bacon? Papa johns is usually better than this."}
{"text":"If I could have given 0 stars this would have been a better representation of how bad this service was. On Thanksgiving day I went onto the papa john's website to order pizza for my co-workers. At the top of the screen it said \"taking online orders\" but after my order was charged it notified me that the place was closed. Eh i'll take part of that blame I guess but I wish I had only known that it was going to get more frustrating than expected. I called the store and to verify that my order was still in their system. The guy on the phone was so confused and said that there was no order, but my online bank statement said differently. After calling two other Papa John's the same idiot called at 11:10a and asked If I still wanted the order that was made online yesterday. Well I guess I've waited this long why the heck not at this point. My lunch was at 1p so I requested they bring it around that time, the guy said \"yeah sure\". After calling two more times to verify if the pizza was out for delivery I finally received it at 1:40p (Goodbye 3/4 of my lunch time I didn't want you anyways). If my card hadn't had been already charged for a tip... well there simply wouldn't have been one. So I sit down, open the box and grab a luke warm slice out of the box to finish up my lunch that was finally here. I would have mentioned the partially burnt knots but eh enough people have pics posted to validate that already so no need. Best advice: If you have a choice between Papa Johns and a Tony's pizza just go with Tony's (Your welcome in advance)."}
{"text":"Wow,I placed an order here last night and the pizza was to my door in 15 minutes!  I got a pepperoni pizza with a chocolate chip cookie and the cookie's are to die for. Also if you order online there are a lot of good deals going on."}
{"text":"I have to admit that I was skeptical with all of the previous reviews but they were one of the few pizza establishments that deliver to our area near the hospital.  I knew it was Sunday night so there might not be many places open to deliver late on Sunday but then I realized football games are on and it's the weekend of Black Friday.  In fact I found their 50% off Black Friday deal through the weekend and it worked!!  I was so happy and they delivered to our building, I met them at the front (they even called me), around 10:25pm at night!  I was impressed!  I had put the order in around 9:40pm and it was 4 pizza's and two 2 liters for $40!  A nice deal when you think about it because this was for 8 people, including myself, working late on Sunday night.   The food was exactly what I have come to expect from Papa John's when I crave pizza and this was FRESH pizza as it was still hot.  Plus, the two liters made it all the better. Overall, I am SO glad that Papa John's is close to where I work because I work nights and it just makes all the difference to know that I can either pick up or have delivered (before midnight) pizza from Papa John's. Thank you Papa John's, we will be ordering from you again if you keep bringing the special deals and good pizza for all of us here."}
{"text":"The way any company SHOULD treat a customer!  I found a cheaper coupon on the window and they gave it to me!  I saved over $2.00!!  Thank you Papa John's for being good to your customers!        I have always thought Papa John's was one of the BETTER pizza chains and I still feel that way.  I ordered a 5 topping, large thin crust and 6 no sauce roasted wings. Originally, it was supposed to be over $18 but as I went inside the place I saw a cheaper pizza coupon, pointed it out and the wonderful employee there honored that!  $15.99 total!  Not too bad actually!  I will DEFINITELY be back!  The only reason I am giving 4 out 5 stars is because I did NOT receive a complimentary garlic sauce.  Thin crust or not, EVERY pizza should have a small tub of garlic sauce.  Maybe next time."}
{"text":"There was a hooked deal available on a Saturday night that was $6.99 for a large, 1-topping pizza from Papa John's. I decided to count up some change and make the [very cold] trek to Papa John's, since the fine print of the Hooked deal said pick up only.  I did call ahead and stated that I would be using the Hooked deal for a large, thin crust with spicy Italian sausage for pick up. The girl on the phone strangely asked me for my address, and quickly said the total was $9.90. I thought both of these statements were odd, but didn't think anything of it. This is where things went south....  I got to the store 30 minutes later and they couldn't find my pizza. After 5 minutes of looking and asking, they discovered it was out for delivery. I also received a phone call while this was going on, from a number I didn't recognize, which was the delivery driver.  The girl behind the counter said it was being delivered, and I politely said that it was supposed to be a pick-up order, because I was using a Hooked deal and it specifically stated pick-up only. I waited about 10 minutes before my pizza was re-delivered to the store, and I was able to pay for it and walk home.  By the time I got home the pizza was cold not only from me walking outside, but from having been made and hauled around by mistake for an extra 20 minutes or so before I even paid for it. After warming it up myself, I was at least a little happy that (1) I did get to eat and (2) the pizza was what I ordered.   Pizza tends to be my kryptonite and I'm usually pretty sympathetic with my ratings, even in the case of cheap, not-so-great pizza like Papa John's. However, this was not a good experience and mistakes were made by someone who wasn't me. I explicitly stated over the phone I would be picking up the pizza, using a Hooked deal, and paying with cash in the store."}
{"text":"Super disappointed in the online ordering system.  I ordered at 8:15 pm and it said approx delivery time is 24-34 minutes.  It's 9:14 pm and the pizza just arrived.  What is exceptionally disappointing was the lack of customer service I received from \"Travis.\" He basically said the delivery estimated time is incorrect, which is a problem someone should look into.  I let him know I would warn others about this poor system as well to save someone a headache in the future.  As always, I \"deliver\" on time."}
{"text":"Whoever Alaina is should be fired. No beating around the bush here, I tell it like it is. She sucks at her job and has no customer service skills.  If you dont know an answer, put the phone on hold and go get one honey. I will never order from here again because of her.  Ordered the pizza over 2 and a half hours ago and still no cheese sauce has been delivered because she forgot to tell the driver we ordered it. Good Job Alaina! You just lost your employer business.  Hopefully the owner actually reads and follows up on these because we are the ones who pay your bills. Dont forget that."}
{"text":"Ugh, I hate to write bad reviews but this pizza was over an hour and a half late, and gave me some serious food poisoning the other night.  Didn't want to drive so I got delivery and after an hour, I called to check on the status. The owner was gruff and said it was down the street. Nope. A half hour later it gets here still warm, so I had two slices. A few hours later I was hugging the toilet. The next day, I called just to let em know what happened. They said they'd get right back to me, so I waited a day before calling corporate. The customer service is terrible there. I'm still waiting to hear back."}
{"text":"I went here this evening to pick up my online order and could not believe the behavior of the manager! He was yelling at customers, employees, slamming stuff around and really inappropriate. If my teenager worked here I would make them quit because of how badly he talked to the kids working for him tonight! Hope the owner reads this and helps the staff and customers."}
{"text":"This is Order # 0077 Web/Delivery 04/13/2015 Ordered at 08:33 PM  Out time was 8:47 PM Reference # 96891 Batch Id : 512  better ingredients Better pizza :)  these people delivered much ahead of the delivery time. The guy who came in the rain was so super nice. Very polite,   courteous. Highly nice behavior. he is really caring and he said No one has given the amount of tips. They could adjust in the Order for Veggie Pizza without Mushroom and add jalapenos- they did a great Job.  Normally i go to PIzza Hut:) whereas my family likes Papa Johns:) Amazing both of them are good:) Total was 35.86 for one person. Wanted to send long back for these people. Forgot to take the person who helped me on the phone nor the delivery- we have   to find a way to recognize them."}
{"text":"Terrible service, the worst we've EVER had!!!  We lived in Cleveland for years and Papa John's was the best pizza around.  After we moved to Streetsboro, we were forced to find other places.  (Blasiole's is best) Recently, Papa John's opened a location in Streetsboro.  I ordered 4 orders of peppers and received 4 peppers the first time.  I called and they added a credit for 4 orders for the next time.  I called the next time and low and behold they forgot the peppers!  The manager sent them out, but were already done eating by the time they arrived.  I just ordered again and called to make sure we would receive 4 orders.  The person I spoke with said \"Don't worry, the pros are here tonight.  Those other guys were new\".  Go figure... our order arrived missing a pizza and all of the peppers!!!  When I called, the manager John said \"It's here, we were out of boxes so everyone got confused. We'll send it out right away\".  The driver arrived 20 minutes later with a cold pizza (for the kids) and tinfoil pan full of peppers.  John offered a free pizza the next time we ordered, but I guarantee it won't be ANYTIME SOON!!!  Unbelievable.  Just unbelievable.  Oh and another time, we received a pizza with red peppers instead of green.  No problem for some, but my fiance is allergic to tomatoes so I thought we were going to have to rush him to the hospital.  After almost having a panic attack, the store was able to assure me that their green peppers came in red.  Would have been nice to get a call as he said \"I wasn't even sure we were allowed to serve that\". #EPICFAIL"}
{"text":"I've ordered from them a few times since opening and it hasn't gotten better. They take usually 70-80 minutes for delivery. The kicker is that I live about 3 miles away.  I went inside once to pick it up and the staff was less than cordial. They weren't rude, just unpleasant.  The drivers are decent, just the entire operation is slow. When I was zoned to receive delivery from the one on sunset and pecos, which is about  6 miles away, I always received it in about 40 minutes or less. My other issue is in the quality. It doesn't taste the same as other John's around town. They also are scrimpy with their sauce, even if you ask for extra. I now will purposely order and pick up from other locations simply to avoid this one."}
{"text":"Pizza arrived in under 45 minutes,  but was dried out. I  ordered 2 garlic sauce (@$1.90) and received one. The cheesy sticks...well, also dry. Wondering I f  these sat in a delivery car for awhile. Not at all what I  expected. Woke up during the night violently ill. SAD."}
{"text":"I ordered delivery due to the cold. I have a special needs sister and I did not want to take her out in below freezing weather to avoid her taking ill.    The ordering experience was fine. The delivery person was very polite. Especially considering the cold working conditions.   When the pizzas arrived they were undercooked and sauce was so watery the toppings were nearly floating. The cinnamon pull apart wasn't fresh at all. It was lukewarm and drowned in icing and hard in some spots.   When I called, I only requested the worst pizza be replaced because I had a bogo and used points for the pull apart. (Figured this was maybe why they were giving away stuff because the quality was subpar) I was placed on hold without explanation. After a few minutes, I was still on hold. I wasn't sure if the call was disconnected.  I called back and the person told me she did not remember the call and that I was never placed on hold. (It was a 5-minute hold...seriously? At least pretend to care about customer grievances)  I walked her back through our conversation and then asked what the resolution would be since I had to actually come pick it up whereas I ordered delivery initially. I explained that it would be an inconvenience and why. I was placed on hold abruptly...again! The team member said that the manager could only offer one or the other. I opted for the refund and then had to ask what next steps (i.e. did I need to come in person, when would it be done, etc.) would be. (This is standard information that should be offered whenever a refund is issued.)  Needless to say the experience was less than pleasurable. I feel that management didn't take adequate ownership of the issue.   This caliber of experience is something you warn others about to prevent them from encountering similar disappointment. So you've been warned."}
{"text":"My husband and I ordered pizza from this Papa John's for delivery. His pizza was on regular crust and was fine, but mine was on gluten free crust and was burned. I called to request a replacement and was told by the manager \"this is the way it's always going to come out.\" I've had Papa John's pizza on gluten free crust at another location and it wasn't burned or the equivalent of eating rocks. If you have to follow a gluten free diet don't waste your time with this Papa John's location."}
{"text":"Our first time ordering in years and they can't get an online pizza order right , on top of trying to tell me what my email order states . This is why I haven't ordered takeout during football season always a disappointment ."}
{"text":"If you always want something to be wrong with your order, order from this location. I love the pizza and garlic sauce, so I keep coming back... and every time there is a mistake. Sometimes it's a small mistake like forgetting the extra garlic sauce that I paid extra for, sometimes it's a large mistake like giving my pizza to someone else so when I arrive my food isn't there. EVERYTIME they are reluctant to admit wrong doing or fix it."}
{"text":"I am so disappointed with this locations I went here was gonna put in my order for pick up with my t mobile Tuesday free pizza and guy tells me I have to do it online. No big deal I can do that real quick. Then he tells me oh well it's 9:50 we can't do online carry out orders after 9:40 pm. Umm why you don't close till 11 so that makes no damn sense. Then tells me and I can't put the order in manually and walks away. Well thanks for making me waste my free pizza. Horrible customer service! What happened to doing something to make the customer happy. Worst part is I constantly order from this location. No more now!"}
{"text":"I've ordered countless amounts of pizza from Papa John's,  so the pricing is pretty much embedded in my brain.   Beginning about a month ago,  there has been a nearly 30% price increase in pizzas,  almost a dollar additional delivery charge,  and 10 to 15% increase on side orders.   Even with a half off coupon code,  after delivery and tip,  you're still spending nearly $20 for a 2 liter and a large specialty.   That's crazy talk."}
{"text":"Ordered delivery.. It was delivered on time but the pizza was cold. Not warm, but cold. Garlic knots were not cooked thoroughly. They were completely doughy. So gross."}
{"text":"Not sure why Papa John's ratings is only 1.5 stars. This is one of the best pizza's I've ever tasted. We asked for a large pizza with ham, pineapple, extra cheese and onion and it was a perfect balance of each item. The staff was friendly during ordering and delivery. If you're ever in Las Vegas, and have a craving for pizza and not sure where to order from, I would highly recommend Papa John's. Way to go Papa John. I'm very picky about my pizza and you knocked this one right out of the park."}
{"text":"I have never liked Papa Johns, but I just moved here and pizza delivery options are low here for a decent price so I hesitantly ordered. Pizza was fast and hot! I was amazed at the taste. I do not know if they use a different sauce or crust here, but damn that pizza was epic!!!! I was sad to leave kids with it while we went out to eat. I was stuck thinking of this pizza it tasted so dang good!!!"}
{"text":"I'm not impressed at all by this store, or the parent company for that matter.  I recently tried to order online,and both times this store said they \"didn't have the order.\"  The managers didn't care, and acted like it was my fault.  Both times I called corporate; the first time, corporate \"found\" my order and rectified the matter.  The second time their customer service agent said the local store would call me, but they never did, but she did admit the website wasn't crystal clear.  I don't have time for their buggy website to improve!"}
{"text":"This papa John's use to be really good on time with great pizza but Lately they have been slacking horribly. I don't usually write bad reviews unless i have a really bad experience.... unfortunately, after waiting an hour on a 30 min projected wait time I called the store who then told me my pizza was done but it would be another hour because they are waiting on a driver. Ended up going up to the store to pick up my pizza. Another time i waited almost 2 hours for our pizza and I received a burnt pizza the entire pizza was dark brown and hard. I couldn't believe they let a pizza like that make it into a box and leave the store. When I called to complain I was told there is nothing they can do besides make another pizza and wait at least another hour for them to deliver it. no discount or refund. Horrible customer service and if you are given a \"projected delivery time\" add at least 20min to an hour to that time and you MAY receive your pizza.....but it may be messed up when you finally to get it."}
{"text":"I ordered pizza & a cookie last night.  I edit a \"The Works\" and order it my way which I think might be an easy way to get a good pizza.  The cookie with caramel was delish!  Thanks Papa John's!  We will be back!"}
{"text":"I order the online special advertised with a big C....2 large pizza and a large Diet Pepsi 2  Inter it said 2 large pizzas $13.00 plus topping.. I had it delivered to Kindred Care 1575 Brainard Roa, Lyndhurst, Ohio. 44124 room 102 Directly across the street from Papa John Lyndhurst.  I am in a wheelchair I was going to pay the 2.50 delivery charge..$13.00 for two large pizzas plus the topping I got banana peppers and mushroom....the delivery came it was 1 ..one large pizza and 1 Diet Pepsi....I said the advert on the website said 2 for 1300.... I was told this store in Lyndhurst does not control or go by the website that I had to pay $13.00 for the one pizza. I ordered on line and they told me but now I called in , yes to check they got my order online obviously they did because they knew the topping and address to deliver BUT they said 1 pizza $13.00 I said NO the website said 2 pizza $13.00.... I was told too bad and they took the pizza back from me and upset me terrribly!!!  This is SO wrong I am going to contact the corporate office they told me too bad they are a franchise and do not care!!!!  I am shaking because of this and going to contact better business bureau and the news stations on how a senior center customer was treated and that this Lyndhurst store would NOT honor the posted advert on the Papa Johns website July 2017..... I was a long time customer in Lyndhurst and think that the whole team needs to be fired they just laughed at me over the phone the one man stuttered and had no idea how to handle customer relations....I will take this to the media as I will not be treated like this by Papa John bullies.... cindyselvaggio@yahoo.com"}
{"text":"Comon  guys,  it's Papa Johns...they aren't known for gourmet pizza. When you drink a little too much, they will deliver you edible pizza, although it does take a little while. If you want to shove pizza in your suck hols, Papa Johns is just fine."}
{"text":"NO STARS!!  \"I guess \"Tony the store manager at this location, took my order and told me I had to order online, after me telling him I couldn't. He continues to tell me the large online carry out which is 9.99 is the same as a medium three topping which was also a special option(his words)!! I normally order one large with pepperoni and extra sauce (regularly). He also includes it's the same price delivery or pick up .. I ask my spouse do you want it delivered, he proceeds and says it will be ready in 15 mins for pick up . My spouse goes to pick it up it's 16$ for a medium picked up pizza  I should've ordered Pizza Hut or Dominoes... and the rude Manager Tony couldn't even be somewhat helpful!! Wanted to charge 10 cents for extra peppers after giving two packets..  over all horrible experience and I haven't known Papa Johns for that !"}
{"text":"I just moved to this side of town and needed a new pie shop... gave them a try and I have only had great service and good pie...  Thanks for standing behind your product"}
{"text":"Delivery Hours: 11:00 am - 01:00 am Carryout Hours: 11:00 am - 11:30 pm  We had been having problems with delivery. Finally wrote them feedback on their web site. After about 2 weeks they actually called. Since then we've been getting good service.  Our apartment is hard to find the entrance is not where the street numbers should be. We always give the order taker the directions, but it wasn't getting to the driver. Hopefully they have fixed that.   We really prefer Papa John's over the others."}
{"text":"Fast food, by that I mean you get it very quickly after ordering it if you are living in the shadyside/CMU area. If you live really close you can order online and pick up by yourself. Like their new cheesesteak pizza. Overall not special, but can be so satisfying for after-midnight treats."}
{"text":"I am beyond upset . Called in for some pizza on a Sunday night . First customer service rep. Answered delightfully and couldn't hear one word . Very busy location ! Maybe management can help out and hire more personnel! Hung up ad called again maybe a connection problem . The snot nose nasty attitude of the girl who answered was the utmost nastiest rudest I've ever felt with . I drove to the store and made them aware of what was going on . I will drive the 4 miles out of my way just to avoid this particular papa John's . Very disappointed but I'll not let it ruin my night . Hope my review helps !"}
{"text":"Jennifer and her crew never fail to provide excellent and speedy service! The pizza quality is undoubtedly superior to other pizza chains in the area. Working for an apartment community, I've called them up for several times for our community events, and they're very reliable to get stuff done on time and for a fantastic price! Thank you Jennifer and the rest of the team for always doing great work!"}

However ----stars  Go to PIZZA HUT Or at corner for $5 at cicis' Or even $5$ at 7-11 at other corner. Don't hate its GOOOOOOOD"}
{"text":"Ordered a pizza and bread for delivery they put in as a pick up.  After waiting a half hour they assured me it was on the way.  Another 20 minutes and I called again.  Now I'm told the driver is checking out and it will be here in 15 minutes.  Unacceptable service. I will take my business elsewhere!"}
{"text":"I wish I would have looked at the reviews of this location before I placed an order. For superbowl Sunday I ordered 3 pizza's for my friends and I to be delivered at our hotel. When we went downstairs to pickup the pizzas we could not find the delivery person. We called him to learn that our pizzas were given to someone else. To be completely honest, I can understand this type of mistake. HOWEVER, when I called the manager to explain the mix up, I was turned over to the delivery person who YELLED, was DISRESPECTFUL AND ACCUSED ME OF LYING TO HIM. It was extremely uncalled for and unprofessional. I have already put a phone call and email to the business but I want to advise other costumers to not visit this location. I will no longer be a costumer of any Papa John location until I hear back from the business or corporate with an appropriate apology."}
{"text":"Decent pizza, even better when it's only $5 for a large.  Even with Dominos new recipe, I'd still say Papa John's wins hands down.  The slightly sweet crust and garlic butter dipping sauce is amazing.    They've been running the $5 large one-topping pizza deal for the last few years at this location, which is perfect.  You generally have to go through eatcu.com for it, but I've also just walked in and asked for it and they've given me the deal."}
{"text":"This is my go to Papa John's location because it's close by me. Located right off of Blue Diamond on Cimarron. I always order for pick up online. Workers are fast and very friendly. Orders are usually ready in about 15 minutes so by the time I get there it's always hot and ready."}
{"text":"If I could give negative stars I would! We come here A LOT, I have four boys and they love their pizza. Lately they've been uncooked or burnt with cheese stuck to the boxes. Ordered from them a couple nights ago and my order was totally wrong and they said that they put it on our account that the next time I came in I would get the same order credited because they messed it up and all I had to do was order with the same phone number and they would see the credit. I went tonight and ordered like they told me to and they told me they knew nothing of this deal and shrugged their shoulders. The pizza was again uncooked yet burnt the crust, imagine that. So my order was not credited and burnt yet uncooked. Never again will I spend another dime in this place. Definitely need new management or something.  Won't be coming again."}
{"text":"I was a loyal Papa John's customer for quite a while. I would order pizza for delivery from this location on a regular basis. Good/decent pizza at a great price. Of course, I would never tout Papa John's as the best pizza in town or anything, but hey, it is/was cheap and pretty good.  Not anymore.  The pizza got worse and worse as time went on. It gradually declined from a great pizza at a great price to a \"What the cuss happened to this pizza\"? Finally, after the last pizza I had delivered, which was undercooked and looked like someone literally threw skimpy toppings in clumps, I had enough. So, I sent a complaint to customer service, which, they say, is World Class Customer Service. Not sure which world that is, because after almost a month, I've heard nothing from them.  Papa John's is a dead beat dad. They obviously don't care about the customer, nor the quality of the product. Who's your daddy? It's definitely not Papa John's."}
{"text":"Wow!  I have ordered 3 pizzas recently from this location and they all were very poorly made.  I have lived in other areas around the country and PJs was awesome, but here, no.  These people seem very lazy and mismanaged.  I have decided to leave Papa now because this shop is WEAK!!!!  I would expect at least sauce and cheese to the crust but the last pizza (Cheeseburger) was almost burnt and they didn't even make an effort to fill in the entire pizza with ingredients.  You guys are half-assed at best!  Bye bye..."}
{"text":"If I could give no stars, I would. We have given this Papa John's location too many chances.  Every time we ordered over the phone, it took forever and honestly felt like they were incompetent. Yes, every single time.  I started ordering online and that relieved that aspect.  However, my pizza would be cold every time it was delivered. I love Papa John's pizza but lord I do like hot pizza and can't take it any longer.  The other day I ordered my pizza at 4:10 (said it would arrive in 30 to 40 minutes) the guy finally got to my house at 5:16 and the pizza was cold again.  I called the manager after an hour and asked where it was, Laurie explained well they are taking an hour now.  Didn't apologize for the inconvenience or anything until the 2nd time I called and cancelled.  We are not ordering from this Papa John's any longer!   They are constantly later than estimated, cold pizza every time, and idiots taking orders..  just say no!!!    The only good thing is the drivers seem nice."}
{"text":"We decided spur of the moment to order some late night pizzas. We were pleasantly surprised at how good they were. The pizza was still hot when it arrived and the order was 100%."}
{"text":"I have had a terrible expericence with this particular location. If your willing to wait upwards of 30 minutes to place an order with these guys then you'll be happy, otherwise the mentality of the so called shift supervisor is; \"I'll get to you when I get to you\". I have never experienced such a lack of consideration in a place dealing with customers and potential issues. I personally will NEVER call this location again, or refer anyone else to do so."}
{"text":"3stars only for being apologetic !!! I ordered take out was told 30 min so I was there!!! Pulse sat there 15 min only one guy working in the inside!!!! Can't believe it on a Saturday night!!!!"}
{"text":"The management at this location sucks. After multiple issues with either undercooked or burned pizza I gave up on this location and on Papa John's Pizza."}
{"text":"When ever we feel like changing our pizza up we come here. I love the fact that they have the free pizza offers and that you get points with your order that can me redeemed for a free pizza.  Plus in my book. If I can save some money and feed the family I'm happy.   This visit we ordered online and picked it up. Did the usual 2 pizzas...gotta have leftovers :). We got a large cheese pizza...easy peasy. It was good. The 2nd was the works with green peppers. I was told it was good as well. No complaints about the pizza. I decided I wanted a salad, they offered papa John salad for $4 or 2 for $5.50 so I opted for the 2. When I went and picked it up I saw the salad was the kind you buy at the grocery store. No biggie, I took it. When I ate it (didnt even eat half of it) the lettuce was limp and gross...just didn't taste fresh. What can I expect from a packaged salad. I def. won't be getting it again."}
{"text":"When in Vegas and wanting to spend more money on experiences and less on food, (plus I had a free pizza to eat thanks to Papa Johns Rewards) we went for it!  Our large pepperoni and sausage pizza was just as we expected it to be and my honey chipotle wings were as tasty as hoped! Everything was presented at the level we expect at any Papa Johns in our home town or in Vegas while on vacation!  I'll keep this location in my vacation file!"}
{"text":"The best papa johns delivery I have experienced. Order was quick and correct. The ingredients looked fresher than most papa johns and the driver was so friendly."}
{"text":"We have been having great experiences with them until recently. One of the main problems is that I always ask for extra garlic sauce and the past 4x the pizza has been delivered with no garlic sauce. It's seriously my favorite part of eating papa John's pizza. Also my order has been wrong with different toppings a few times and the delivery driver didn't care. Im starting to think I don't want to order from here anymore which is a shame because we usually order a pizza once a week."}
{"text":"I ordered from here a few days ago and because of that experience, I will NEVER order from Papa John's again. I ordered from my phone (like I always do) and paid with my credit card (like I always do-which they charged immediately) and had my bf go pick up the pizza on his way to my place (like he always does). They would not give him the pizza because apparently they have a new policy that the person paying has to be present. Ok, I get it, you guys implement a new policy. Business's are completely allowed to do things like that. No problem. However, it would be nice for the customer that when they are placing the order, there is some kind of notice that states this policy so I could have made my decision based on that.  So I called and spoke to a girl there (Jennifer or Jessica?). She was rude from the moment she started talking. Telling me how that's just their policy and there's nothing that can be done about it. I then told her that I think that is wrong of them since it never said anything about needing to be present online when I placed the order. She then proceeded to ARGUE with me saying that it does say it on there as well as in the confirmation email. I told them to refund my card since they refused to release my order, which they did. I then went back to the email (and read EVERY LAST WORD. It NEVER mentioned this policy. I also went back to the mobile order screen and it also DOES NOT STATE THE POLICY! So there was no way to know of this policy before ordering.   I immediately wrote to customer service and told them of my experience and even offered to send proof that the policy was not stated anywhere! I received the automatic reply that my email was received but have yet to have any real response. I wouldn't be surprised if they sent my complaint to the store directly so of course they won't respond. What a joke!"}
{"text":"Placed a delivery order using the app. Everything came as ordered and driver was very friendly. Pizza delicious and breadsticks were yummy too."}
{"text":"This is the 3rd time I've ordered pizza from this location & this is the 3rd time- I don't get my sauces that I've ordered   I ordered extra cheese sauce ( and paid for it) and never got it & this has happened more than once ...  also- the way the garlic  breadsticks looked when we got them was also poor delivery.   Just not satisfied"}
{"text":"I ordered a pizza from this papa johns. Gave my address and waited for the pizza to be delivered. 20 minutes later I received a phone call saying they don't deliver to my address. (3 miles away) when I complained about not being told that when I ordered the manager hung up on me. Horrible customer service."}
{"text":"Phone guy was RUDE!  Should probably consider providing better service when you have epic Papa Dels to compete with."}
{"text":"So this is an update to my previous review based on my interaction with management.   I've never had an owner/manager address me so thoroughly and respectfully as the owner/partner of this particular franchise. After seeing my review he explained to me of the staffing problems they were facing in the restaurant at the time that my original review occurred. It all made perfect sense in hindsight and to hear such concern and honesty from an owner was refreshing to say the least.  I was reimbursed for the Pizza and I look forward to more \"pizza and movie nights\" with the roommates.  Bottom line, I probably shouldn't of been so harsh on a short staffed locally owned pizza franchise because of cold food. I guess it's kinda funny but I will definitely be ordering again!"}
{"text":"Good Evening,  This is not an email that I would like to take the time to write this evening to you at Papa John's as I have historically been a very happy customer. In fact I would much rather be writing to you to tell you how wonderful my experience was vs. how embarrassing, and inappropriate it has been.  The order you see below in the attached email was one that I placed for my family while I am traveling in Arizona on business. I wanted to treat them to a favorite of theirs, which as you can see by our order history on our account we are consistent and happy customers ordering pizza every month, more or so.  This order below however may change who I choose to do business with for several reasons.  Being away from my family I thought I would provide them with a treat and order them pizza to be delivered to our home in Las Vegas. I had no problem as usual placing the order online (I even used my iPhone) with the \"local\" location (Store #2820). My family were quite excited about this and I felt good being able to treat them since I was not home. All went smoothly, the delivery person was allowed through our security gate after a call TO ME to confirm that they were allowed access. What transpired next is absurd and causes me to question my continuation of business with Papa John's. The delivery person requested from my wife my credit card so that they could take an imprint of it on the receipt. Of course my wife did not have the card as this pizza was a gift and I am not at home. They explained to her that they require my card and signature in order to allow my wife to take the pizza or they would be unable to hand it over to her. This caused her embarrassment, and grief, as she knew this was supposed to be a gift from me and not something she was going to have to pay for herself. However our children were hungry, and my wife being 7.5 months pregnant also was hungry having waited the requisite time for the delivery and so provided her payment to the individual.  At no time was I contacted by the delivery driver about the need for my card to be present. At no time in the past has a driver instructed me to provide my exact payment card. Nowhere I could find on your website does it say you must provide the same card for an imprint.  I have ordered pizza from Papa Johns before, for business luncheons as I at times must provide lunch for training meetings of up to 13-15 large pizza's, multiple 2 liter bottles of soda etc... I am now questioning if this is something that I want to do with a company that is going to behave this way. I shudder to think if this were a gesture towards a customer as opposed to my family where I wanted to send lunch to reward them and the delivery driver demanded payment from them because I was not present.  This is simply unacceptable. I recognize that perhaps they are looking out for fraudulent behavior... however I would suspect that a company that tracks its customers order through a reward system and even offers to HOLD my credit card information \"for me\" would be able to identify when fraudulent behavior was afoot and address it then. All the store/delivery driver had to do was look at our account history, look at the names on the credit cards and see that they all match up to recognize that this was not anything other than a gift to my family.   Nowhere on your site does it say that you must present the card utilized for the order. In fact you confirm all of the information on the website during the order process INCLUDING the 3 digit check-sum code on the backside of the card.  Your website states the following:   \"PapaJohns.com makes it easy to get your favorite Papa John's food fast. When you register to create an account, you can save Faves and the website will remember your delivery store and past orders. All of your personal information is safely stored in your profile, so it's a snap to update personal information, add new credit cards and more.  To order online, just add items to your cart, customize them just the way you like them, then use our easy checkout process. We'll send you a confirmation email that includes all the details of your order.  Ordering while away from home? Finding a Papa John's store in a new location is easy - just enter the ZIP code to find the stores nearest you, including a delivery location. \"   I expect a reply and remediation of this ex post haste. In addition I would like the charges to my wife's credit card be reversed (I included a $5.00 tip even to the driver) and that the charges be placed properly on my business expense credit card, which I utilized for the order."}
{"text":"i tried calling in an order here a week ago. However, nobody bothers to answer the phone regardless how many times i called. I keep thinking, its too this place to be closed.  So i decided to drive down there and see why they dont answer the phone since its only 2 mins away from me.  Let me say that there were 5 aholes working at that time. I tried calling again while watching them. & in my disbelieve one of the ahole just looked at the phone and let it rang.  Hahhaa... this place is a disgrace!!!!  If i could give this zero out of five stars. I would!!!!"}
{"text":"I usually get carryout from this location whenever I do eat it.  The service has always been good, never an issue.  The wait time is pretty quick and I've never had to wait long at all.    Delivery takes awhile, but that's from anywhere in Charlotte.  The pizza and breadsticks are always good.  I have never had any types of bad food or problem."}
{"text":"We got a large pizza with 2 toppings for just like $12.  It's a walk in place. You can't sit and eat. I think there's just one chair in the whole spot.  I like the pizza. The dough was soft and kind of chewy but in a good way.  Id return."}
{"text":"The manager at this store has some serious issues and should definitely not be dealing with customers.  I have been a loyal customer but today I was talked to so rudely by the manager, \"Joe,\" that I am changing my ways.  We were nice enough and called about a problem with delivery, but the manager was very condescending and called me \"rude\" and \"nasty.\"  I expressed my discontent with the issue and asked why but really didn't expect to be talked to like that.  How is this guy a manager?  That's not how you talk to a customer.  I treated him with respect and wasn't yelling or swearing or doing anything to be talked to like that.  Terrible.  We'll go to other locations from now on, but I really hope corporate does something about this guy who has really bad people skills apparently.  When he started getting an attitude I put the phone on speakerphone...had he known there was a room full of former Papa John's pizza lovers, maybe he would have thought twice about his tone and words?  Also, check out their Google Reviews on this location...obviously we're not the only customers upset with the manager."}
{"text":"We ordered pizza from this location for a party we hosted this weekend. We live in Gilbert, on the border of Gilbert and Chandler. The delivery driver brought the pizza to our same address but in Chandler. After calling us to figure out where we were, he refused to deliver the pizza to us, even though we're only 7 minutes down the road. He insisted that we re-order from the Gilbert location. The Gilbert location was more than accommodating, and we will continue to order from them in the future."}
{"text":"Last time I ordered online from this store I ended up with another customer's pizza. One of my guests had already started eating it before we realized it so I didn't bother calling. Today I ordered a one pizza for the family that had mixed meat and veggie toppings, which was perfect. However, I also ordered a vegetarian style with mushrooms, peppers, and onions. I received a cheese pizza with two slices that had pepperoni and peppers on it. My order was correct on the box. It was correct on my email receipt. The employee that answered the phone, however told me I ordered a sausage pizza? Vegetarians don't order sausage. She was very adamant that is what the computer said. The manager took the phone and said the same thing about sausage. However, like I said, the order was correct on the box and correct on my email receipt. They sent out a replacement and it was badly burned. I will never order from this store again. Order at your own risk."}
{"text":"Will never use this place again. Ordered a buffalo chicken pizza online to be picked up in store. I picked up the pizza and got him home only to realize they forgot to put the buffalo sauce on my buffalo chicken pizza, so I was stuck with a cheese and chicken pizza. I called the store explaining what happened and they apologized and said they would have their driver bring buffalo sauce within 20 minutes. An hour and a half later, still no buffalo sauce. I called the store again, only to be told they would send a new pizza but I would have to pay the delivery fee. I explained I wasn't paying the delivery fee for a mistake they made. The employee then said I could talk to the manager so I spoke to Dillon the manager, who explained that in would have to pay the delivery fee and he couldn't seem to understand why I didn't want to pay for their mistake. I then just told him to refund me my money and forget about the pizza, I asked for a confirmation email to be sent that then refund had gone through. Dillon stated that wasn't possible that he could print out the receipt and I could pick it up. Absolutely ridiculous service with no customer service skills. Like I said before, we will never go here again!"}
{"text":"I normally order pizza from this location on a regular basis. I would carry out but this was my 1st time having it delivered...I completed my order at 7:00 it was confirmed on the delivery tracking that the order would be delivered at 7:37 well I did not get my order until 8:15. Almost 40 mins after the tracker staled that I would have my food. The pizza was cold and my wings were under cooked. I called the establishment and was told I could get a free pizza :( the manager stated that she would used this as a coaching opportunity for her drivers. Honestly that is not my issue. It will be a while before I return here."}
{"text":"Wtf..cant even explain how horrible the quality is now. Its been a while since my last bad experience and now itll prob be the last from here."}
{"text":"After arguing with Kay over which business to have food delivered from, Kay got her way and caused me to spend around 40 smackers (including tip) on a pizza that had the consistency and flavor of a flat, sopping wet sponge with catsup and mucuous-like cheese on it. This was a \"meat lover's\" also, meaning it was piled high with ham, pepperoni, and bacon, all of which were of Steakumms-level delectability.   The wings were rubbery and fat like tool handles.   The CinnaApple Pie for dessert was about a notch above Entenmanns. Sugary icing, canned pie filling, and that pathetically pliant crust satisfied a sweet craving and barely.  Delivery took over an hour despite being minutes away.   Papa John's ain't got it goin' on. Let this review remind you the reader to support your indie pizza parlors."}
{"text":"Last time I ordered they messed up my pizza order, so I called back and the manager told me that next time I ordered I would get a pizza for free. Sounded like a good idea at the time until I tried to redeem that free pizza and it magically vanished. Nowhere to be found. It was my mistake to trust that they would actually hold up their end. If they offer you a \"free\" pizza after they mess up your order, it's probably just to shut you up. Take the immediate redelivery instead."}
{"text":"Great service at this location. I usually get delivery and it is delivered accurately to their ETA or even earlier at times, and when I do go to pick it up they are very consistent about checking for id. Good for them and good for their customers. Pizza is consistently delicious and their cheese sticks rock. I always use coupons or promo codes instead of paying full price, and with those prices it becomes a very good deal for delicious pizza that does not have skimpy toppings.  There was once where I ordered an extra cheese pizza and the amount of cheese did not even qualify as a regular amount. I was offset since we always had good service and quality food here, so I sent them a comment about this and in return we received a comped pizza, and I should mention this did not take long... maybe a week or so. That kept me an extremely satisfied customer and I've had absolutely no other complaints."}
{"text":"Ghetto disrespectful and bullshit if you ask me. I asked for extra cheese didn't get I got my pizza delivered when I open the box my ranch sauce was literally in my pizza my wings look like someone was eating off of them. I'll never go back there again terrible costumer service. They have foul language and I don't trust them making my food I'm cool."}
{"text":"Pizza is the worst I have ever had. Ordered an extra large and got a large. When I called them to tell them all they said was \"sorry\".  They also charged me $5 more for the pizza then the online price. First time ever having Pappas John's, and it will be my last."}
{"text":"Update: Just ordered delivery for the second time, with another 5 star experience. The quoted wait was 80-90 minutes (blah). However, it was here in 54, with an apology from the driver for the wait. I was concerned the food wouldn't be as great as last time because of the long wait (perhaps sitting in the warmer, or drivers car), but I was wrong, it was perfect again!   Original review: I've been eating Papa John's for the last 20 years. I've ordered it in dozens of cities from dozens of different franchises. This location officially baked the best original papa johns breadsticks I have ever eaten. As much as I love them, I will say they are usually a bit hard for my preference, but this time they were baked to sweet perfection. The pizza was good too. Delivery was timely especially for a Friday night (34 minutes to be exact). This review is based off of one order, so I can't speak to the consistency, but so far, 5 stars."}
{"text":"We order from this location ALL the time where I work.  We always place our order online so I cannot speak to the call in experience.  Our orders always arrive on time and as expected.  On a couple of occasions, the staff has called to let us know if there is a delay from what the website indicated due to the quantity that we have ordered.  We generally order pretty large numbers of pizza, so we are never surprised by this. We really appreicate the heads up though.   The team members that I have spoken to on the phone are always nice and courteous.   On multiple occasions when we have ordered really large quantities, the delivery drivers even help us carry the pizza upstairs to our events room.  I have never experienced a driver that has been anything less than respectful and friendly.  We will definitely continue to do business with this location."}
{"text":"My son was craving pizza so we stopped in. Andrew was very friendly, patient, and helpful in assisting us with our order. He is truly a nice guy who seemed to be enjoying doing his job! Extremely rare to find these days and we had such a great experience we'll travel the extra distance to come to this location in the future.. We'll be having pizza a little more often as well..  Thanks for being so kind!"}
{"text":"Tried this location 3 times.  The last time we ordered it at 4:35, definitely not peak time.  After 45 minutes I tried calling the store and no one picked up.  Listed to a recording for 3-4 minutes and gave up.  The pizza did arrive, right at 1 hour late.  I turned him away.  Tried calling the store again and still no one would answer the phone.  Maybe better employees as well as better ingredients papa."}
{"text":"We ordered delivery and when the driver got to our house, he gave us a total that was $2 higher than what we were told on the phone. We asked why the total was different and he proceeded to explain that it was an additional delivery fee. My husband suspiciously paid him and gave him tip on top of that. Then we checked the pizza box and realized we were right and he completely overcharged us by making up an additional delivery fee. We called the store manager, he told us the driver \"read the total wrong\"and sent the driver back to our house to give us the overpaid cash back. WTF??? Why would you put a customer who just got intentionally ripped off by your employee into such an awkward position??? When we told the manager we didn't want the driver to come back and would rather just keep the credit on our account, he said he didn't have a way of getting in touch with the driver and he was already coming. Ha! Are you kidding??? Is the manager in on this scam? The driver came back and yep - it was pretty awkward. Worst pizza delivery ever!!! Buyer beware!!! Don't pay extra \"delivery\" fees!!"}
{"text":"You know what you're getting when you order pizza from Papa Johns.  It'll never beat the better neopolitan/rustica kind of pizza at a real restaurant but it's quick, cheap, and sometimes you just want fast food pizza right??    I've had a couple of pies delivered from here and every time they come out really fresh.  Breadsticks were also hot out of the oven.  Not something you can say about every Papa Johns, so this one gets my vote of full confidence!"}
{"text":"I wish i would have looked at the reviews before ordering at this location. My pizza was cold, soggy and not cooked all the way. This has been the worse pizza I have had. Should have just ordered from dominos."}
{"text":"Every time we order papa john's pizza on this location there's always a problem. Last time we order to this location they don't have what we order so they call us to replace it. That's fine but when they deliver the 2 large pizza we order both of them are burn and even the delivery driver told us that she give them a heads up that the pizza was burnt before she left the store and she said they said that's fine. So we called the store and the manager said he will give us 2 large credit pizza for next time and still send us 2 new pizza on top of it but it still burn. So after 2 weeks we claimed the credit pizza that the manager give us and now he was saying we only get one credit coz that's what he wrote on the list. My wife make her own notes so she don't forget what they talk about and told the manager about it. And after some good argument the manager gave us the 2 large pizza. But the thing is they marking it sounds like we're begging for that 2 credit pizza. And this is not the first time it happen. They don't respect the customers too. Coz after we spoke with the manager the person that taking the order don't have any customer service and just asking my wife what else do you want? Exact word she say. Papa John's got good pizza but the company need to replace there employee even the manager to have a better customer service."}
{"text":"Food is good to start off and the employee's are great. But I always order for delivery but something in my order is always wrong or missing :/ The garlic sauces are missing, my toppings are wrong, my wing orders are missing/ wrong, and when ordering a drink or dessert it always ends up being forgotten."}
{"text":"Papa Johns is always a pizza go to for me. There online deals are great and the food has always been good. Love there pan pizza. Got to use a promo code today for free 10 pts = cheese sticks. There cheese sticks are truly great especially when made fresh like these were. Totally hit the spot and it was free :)"}
{"text":"Better ingredients?  Better pizza?  You could have fooled me.  The good news is that I didn't have to pay for the pizza.  It was brought in as part of a \"party\" at work.  I always enjoy a free lunch.   For better ingredients, I beg to differ.  I had the sausage & mushroom, which was servicable.  The italian sausage was nondescript - it may have well not been on the pizza.  That was disappointing.  The mushrooms had a good flavor, and that saved it from being a total loss.  The sauce and cheese were run-of-the-mill large-chain quality.  Nothing to write home about.  Thankfully the pizzas came with some garlic dipping sauce, which I used on the entire slice, not just the crust.  So, better pizza?  Hardly.  I went web surfing to see what these pies go for and almost fell over when I saw they charge $14 for a large sausage pie.  Are you kidding me?  A $5 Little Caesars deal is on the same plane of quality as these things.  For less, I can get a safe Pizza Hut pie that I know I will be fine with.  And, for the money, you can get a fantastic representation from a better establishment like Rosatti's or Picasso's.    Sorry Papa John.  You may thing that repeatedly telling us \"better ingredients, better pizza\" will make us believe you.  Heck, you can get Peyton Manning to tell us to.  It might get someone to buy it once, but after that, we'll be on to you.  I wouldn't pay for this out of my own pocket for half the price.  Two stars because it was \"okay\" and didn't make me ill..."}
{"text":"Ordered from here years ago. The pizza arrived with a half-eaten pepper on it. That was the end of that. Don't like the taste, either."}
{"text":"Who is making this pizza? Clearly a bum. Who knew a large pepperoni pizza meant 10 pepperonis total? I could've fit 30 on there no problem without them touching eachother. Hey maybe the delivery guy hogged them down on his way here (was told 45 minutes yet it took an hour) hey though, crust was nice and crispy so what would've been 0 stars turned into three because it was very good."}
{"text":"Until yesterday, I'd never had a bad experience with this location.  I've been sick, and in a LOT of pain for the last 3 days.  Yesterday, I decided that ordering a pizza would be comforting, and help me fall asleep after I ate.  So, I ordered online, like always, and was quoted a 30-40 minute wait time.   55 minutes later, I called to find out where my food was. The kid who answered the phone said \"Oh, its been sitting here ready, but I only have one driver, so I'm waiting for him to get back.\" Me: \"So...my pizza has been sitting there for an hour, and its going to get here cold.\" Him: \"Well, no.  Its been sitting for 30 minutes.\"  WELL EXCUSE ME.  Its still going to be cold when it gets here, you idiot.  What gets me, is that I didn't even get an APOLOGY.     I told him to cancel the order, AND I submitted a complaint on the PJ's website.  Ordered online from Pizza Hut and had my food within 20 minutes or so.    Never again, not if I can help it."}
{"text":"Soo.. the manager finally called me! He was pretty rude and unapologetic and said all he could do was give me a free pizza and cheesesticks next time I phoned in. I said ok, I'll give you guys another try, but will it be easy to redeem this \"offer\". He says just call, there's a note on my account.   I call 3 days later to redeem my free pizza, but the guy on the phone said \"I don't know what you're talking about\" and basically gave me a lot of hassle about redeeming the offer. Then he said \"well the delivery time is 2 hours anyways\". TWO HOURS! Seriously people, on a tuesday. I have better things to do than waste 2 more seconds on these people. I guess they won't be getting their second chance after all..."}
{"text":"Awful! Took way too long and arrived dried out and black! If you like dry, burnt pizza this is your place!"}
{"text":"HORRIBLE!! Our order, 2 pizzas, only took 1 hour and 2 minutes to make after they said it would be ready in 20 minutes, and dont get me started on their so called \"general manager\". Saphire is a real piece of work. How she got that position is more of a mystery than Waldo's location. Apparently she must of been sick the day they taught CUSTOMER SERVICE in her general manager's training. I can also state that the customer before us and one that came in after werent satisfied with their service..."}
{"text":"Ordered a double-pep. w/pineapple.  When I picked-up pizza, opened box and it certainly didn't look like a double-pep. and certainly not like the picture....not even close.  This pizza was barely a single-pep. and when I ask if was a single or double, the guy said it was a single pep.  Reminded him I ordered a double and then he said, oh guess it is a double-pep!.....but it wasn't.  Pretty tasteless and paid for something that wasn't right.  Will not be going back."}
{"text":"The pizza never came... when I called the lady told me the delivery driver did not want to come into the apartment building and come up to the apartment. HORRIBLE service. Will no longer order from here."}
{"text":"I order online from here. The pizza building website thingy is awesome. You can tailor your pizza by the 1/2! Tonight I went with the Fiesta! Beef, sausage, jalapenos and a couple other things. Was pretty tasty on a thin crust! $9.99  You gotta click the link for specials - there's always a bunch of deals going on, so you can save some $. The downside to that is not all the deals are well-described. (e.g., You can get an AZ Cardinals deal, but you only know the price...not what it consists of until you click into it)...that's kinda lame...  Anyway, the toppings are fresh, the guys at the shop will open your box and show you it matches your order. Good for special requests like \"well done crust\".  I usually pick it up ( It's in the Fry's market/Hobby Lobby shopping center), but sometimes we have it delivered. No problems there either. They always offer cheese/red pepper packets either way. The garlic sauce and pepperoncinis are 75cents ea extra, but ya gotta have 'em! Don't forget to add those onto your order!"}
{"text":"They got it right! In Phoenix for business, late dinner and usually don't do \"fast food\" pizza anymore but I'm glad this was the Papa Johns that was close to my hotel. Friendly staff, delivered when promised but more importantly, they made it EXACTLY how I ordered (lite sauce, lite cheese....I know, it's pizza-I have \"dietary restrictions\" lol) and it was good! Crust was perfect, good topping portions and I also got wings that were very good for a retail pizza chain. All and all, I would definitely order from here again. THANKS PAPA JOHNS! :)"}
{"text":"I called an hour before they closed and was told an hour and a half to deliver,  carry out closed.  Really? ? Just say you don't want to take any more orders,  pizza was not good either, crust was thrown together and over cooked."}
{"text":"This place is terribly understaffed. I ordered online an hour and a half prior to picking up.  When I arrived, it took 10 minutes for someone to even speak to me,  then my order had not even been done yet. I had already paid or I would have left.  You need to be much more prepared for day after Christmas. 3 people does not cut it to make the pizza, answer phone and talk to people here.  And I'm not the only one here that is pissed and waiting..."}
{"text":"Customer service is bad. Ordered online at 5:10pm. Got at papa johns at 5:40pm my pizza is still not done. Waited till 6pm still not done. Thank you for making my first time experience great"}
{"text":"Worst papa Johns I've ever dealt with ever : the girl dealing with the phones/register wouldn't even answer the phone she just kept putting it on hold without saying hello. My pizza generally is never cooked so i always have to put cook extra with extra sauce so it had enough and is actually cooked and even then most of the time it still isn't .  I went in this time to cancel my order Bc the girl kept putting me on hold and not actually answering the phone ... and she got an attitude with me and just kept rolling her eyes . Amazing customer service ! I just went to the grocery store and got a frozen pizza instead . I won't ever try this papa johns again ! I hate living in Belmont . I miss NODA!!!"}
{"text":"I love their pizza but half the pizza dough is undercooked. =( I decided to switch back to Domino Pizza, I like thin Brooklyn style dough better."}
{"text":"Where do I begin . .    I ordered a pizza and breadsticks and the man on the phone said it would be delivered around 30-45 minutes later . .   So after an hour I called to see if maybe the delivery guy got lost or couldn't find my home and the same guy answered the phone and had no idea what I was talking about he then said \"oh uhh yea we uh just got the pizza so he'll leave now and be there soon \" I had no idea what he meant by that but I took it as he hadn't even left yet    After another 40 minutes I called again and the same guy answered and said \"he left like 45 minutes ago he'll be there soon\" and then said \"I told you it would be an hour and 45 minutes wait\"  . . umm no he did not or I would have just gone to pick it up myself  . .   When the delivery guy finally arrived it had been two hours since I had placed the order and the Pizza and breadsticks were cold and the pizza and breadsticks both tasted terrible not at all how they usually taste  . . bland and just very bad in general (everyone agreed)   and on top of everything else the delivery guy was extremely rude . .   I always order through papa johns and I have for years but this was the 1st and the last time I will ever order from that location"}
{"text":"My boyfriend forwarded me an email advertising their new garlic knots, so we ended up ordering Papa John's for dinner. I selected a deal for a Large 2-topping for $10, with pepperoni and half bacon/half beef. There was an option to \"Papa Size\" to an X-Large for $2, so I went for it. Also got an order of the 8-piece garlic knots and a chocolate chip cookie. My confirmation email said 30-40 minutes for delivery. The delivery guy rang the doorbell right at the 40-minute mark. Just made it! He was polite and friendly. I enjoyed the pizza, but have to say I was disappointed with the garlic knots. They just tasted like pizza crust with very little garlic on them. =\ But good pizza and cookie."}
{"text":"Ordered pizza for delivery on New Year's Eve. Two mediums: one pepperoni and one with half cheese, half beef & cheddar. The pizza arrived a few minutes earlier than the scheduled time and was definitely a hit at NYE game night. Yum yum!"}
{"text":"Extremely disappointed!!! I normally don't go with the big pizza chains, but I saw a commercial and got a craving.  Well, I really wish I would've done that. I ordered an all meats pizza that tasted fine, but after eating three pieces I paid for this for the next 36 hours. I got food poisoning and was in bad shape. The following day I called and shared this with a Papa Johns manager who told me that they \"try to check the meats and vegetables everyday and that she wasn't sure what could've happened.\" She did tell me that she would pass the info along to her general manager. I have never received a call back from anyone regarding this event.  I learned my lesson! No more pizza from this place and very disappointed with the customer service."}
{"text":"The guy on the phone was probably new, asked the right questions and ended up finding me the pizza of my dreams. Well played, Papa."}
{"text":"This has been my \"go to\" pizza for 12 years.  Was always dependable and fast.   However in the last year they have started making mistakes. So be careful and inspect your order before you leave or let the driver leave."}
{"text":"Haven't ordered from papa johns in years because I think if got pretty sloppy. But they had a 50% coupon online and I'm cheap so I gave it a shot.   Took 20 mins for delivery. Awesome. Pizza looked great, not sloppy or oily. It was really good!! Very happy!! Thanks Kyle B for my pizza experience. :)"}
{"text":"I am now a loyal customer of papa johns thanks to pizza hut. Papa Johns is always consistent and friendly and has flavorful pizza.  Read my review for pizza hut on val vista/warner  I'm a fan of pizza but this place has some serious quality control issues. Last Saturday I ordered a supreme pizza for pick up. I went to the restaurant and stood at the counter for 10 minutes without being helped. Finally I asked the delivery driver on his way out the door if someone could help. He doesn't say anything to me turns around and sends someone out to help me. The cashier doesn't greet me or apologize for the wait just asks for my name. I get my pizza and go home open the box and take a slice out and notice its completely doughy, stretchy and not even close to being cooked. I am so pissed now. I call pizza hut and ask to speak to a manager,  I'm then told to hold then the phone call is disconnected. I call back and get the manager Josh this time and tell him the situation. Josh did apologize, I told him there's no way I'm coming back for another pizza or having one delivered covered in spit, I told him I wanted a refund. The manager did refund my money.  I ended up calling Papa John's to order a pizza, the team member was friendly and polite and my pizza arrived in 30 minutes and fully cooked and fresh. Papa John's delivery driver was also very polite and thanked me for my business. I will not being ordering from the Pizza Hut on Val Vista and Warner. Papa John's now has a new loyal customer!"}
{"text":"TERRIBLE service. Not only did they have me on hold for FIFTEEN MINS straight prior to placing my order, but they told me my food would be here in 30 mins. Not only did it take 2 hours, but it was COLD. I will not be ordering from them again."}
{"text":"Tried them again and they gave me the wrong pizza. Worse....the night manager said I would have to buy another pizza! Don't go here!"}
{"text":"Pretty good pizza with a decent staff. They usually don't dissapoint. Great thing about this place too is that there are always coupons going on."}
{"text":"This Papa Johns is awesome the customer service is outstanding. The team that works there goes above and beyond to make your Pizza the best way you want it and if you want extras they have no problem giving you whatever you want. They truly believe that the customer is always right, and they always do right by the customer. They even give great recommendations if your not sure about anything. Example...I was weary about the pepperoni pizza rolls and I asked them about it and they said they were delicious I took their word and lo and behold they were amazing!"}
{"text":"3/11/18 6-8p  Fantastic from A to Z! Ordered online and when I went to pick the young woman with braces was courteous. Which seems to be so hard at a pizza place. Inside was clean and the pizza was delicious! They once messed up my order, toppings, and offered a free pizza"}
{"text":"I think among the pizza chains, Papa John's is the best by far.  The CEO says, \"Better ingredients, better pizza\" and I couldn't agree more.  Those fresh ingredients make all the difference and you don't need a microscope to see them.  Papa John's pizza crust texture is a stark contrast to Pizza Hut's greasy cardboard crust.  I do have to compliment Pizza Hut on making their crust actually taste like cardboard!  Is it the box?  How do they do that?  Unfortunately, my wife love's Pizza Hut, so I am forced to eat cardboard once in a while.  But when I'm in the mood for delivery, I always order Papa John's."}
{"text":"Pizza is okay, not the greatest.  The drivers need to slow down in our community.  I witnessed a delivery driver in a smaller silver car blow through a red light as well as a stop sign. I will be writing the franchise owner about this and how there drivers need to slow down in our neighborhood."}
{"text":"Ordered online, wanted the 2lg for $7.77 special... It rang up $5.24, so I wanted to call and make sure both pizzas were on the order. I waited on hold 20 MINUTES!!! I swear when I finally gave up holding on the phone the delivery guy was at my door 5min later... So, they are fast, both pizzas were there, and pizza was good (hence the 3 stars)but honestly I think they field phone orders hoping people will just hang up. Hopefully the manager of this store is aware.... With keeping people 20min on hold you're definitely losing $$."}
{"text":"Love this location. They always have the order ready in a decent amount of time. The delivery drivers are great as well. Pizza is always fresh. There are always deals on the website/app or online coupons you can find easy via google. I just learned papa johns now has the pizza tracker too...a link is included in your confirmation email when you place an order online or through the app. Love!"}
{"text":"We order all the time. One of the few places both my kids LOVE!!!!!! My youngest and I can't have cheese and always get extra sauce- no cheese. I appreciate when they call to make sure we don't want any cheese- I order online and they always double check- just in case. The husband and I got 2 different kinds of wings tonight- the best wings at any pizza joint."}
{"text":"We all know and love Papa Johns slogan: \"Better Pizza. Better Ingredients. PAPA JOHNS\" :) I couldn't agree more so here is my review.   I haven't physically being inside this location but I ordered delivery tonight through the Yelp App (which utilizes Eat24 to place the order).  On this cold and rainy night, I placed my order at 7:38pm and it was delivered at 8:18pm which is quick. The pizza arrived fresh and hot. Using the Yelp App to place my order was so smooth and efficient. I ordered a medium pepperoni pizza and it tasted delicious. It cost about $11 then add in the delivery fee and the total price came just under $15.  Don't forget your tip for the delivery driver.   I have no complaints. I'll most likely be back here again.  YUMMY!!!"}
{"text":"So i was very impressed by Antonio's superior customer service at this location. I went by to pick up my pepperoni pizza i ordered, but as I arrived, I decided to add wings to my order. I asked how long would it take, and he said 10min at first which I was willing to wait, but as I placed the order, he rushed my order and got it to me in 2mins. I was impressed with his urgency in wanting to fulfill my order. Thank you because I know you had other orders!"}
{"text":"You know what you're going to get: delivery/take-out pizza. I'm not expecting gourmet anything and I'm not disappointed.  They're fast, efficient and consistent. I usually order online and pick it up -- the people behind the counter are always pretty friendly."}
{"text":"Here's a recap of our insane experience with a delivery driver last night:  We ordered our pizza online around 9:30pm. Around 10:40 we called the store to check on our pizza and we were told that she should have already been here. About 5 minutes later she arrives with our pizzas knowing we were paying in cash and says she doesn't have change when we handed her money, she thought we'd have exact change (I'm sorry, what???? Who assumes that?) our total was $28 and all we had were two 20's. We tell her she's not getting a $12 tip but she can go to the gas station that is less than half a mile from our house to get change. She says we are being too difficult and she can't do that because they're closed. I looked that gas station up on my phone to show her she has about 10 minutes to get there before they close. (We live here. We go to that gas station nearly every day. We knew it wasn't closed). So she said \"well if you're making me go get change I'm taking the pizzas with me\" so we called the store and told the manager what was going on and even he said that was ridiculous and she shouldn't have asked for the pizza back and she should have had change - he also said she should take the $20 we gave her and to go break it then come back. After 5 minutes of her yelling and banging on our door she finally left to go get change and came back for the rest of her payment. Our pizzas were also cold and we ordered the salted Carmel brownies with chocolate chips but just got regular brownies instead. No Carmel or anything.   My husband used to deliver pizza for Papa John's. We weren't being unreasonable in asking for our change, but we almost felt the need to call the police the way she was banging on our door for so long. We will never be ordering from Papa John's again and we were quickly reminded why we stopped ordering from here so long ago. This was by far the worst experience I've ever had with any company in my entire life."}
{"text":"Oh Papa John's. I enjoy your pizza, I love your half off specials when our sports teams win, your mouth watering, crack like garlic sauce, and I love your mobile app. But whyyyyyyyyy do you not carry salads? There have been many times in the past where I have wanted to order Papa John's but chose another pizza place because as far as I recall they have not in the past and are not planning on bringing salads to the menu. Also, your chocolate chip cookie desert is amazing. It melts in my mouth, adds extra pounds to my tummy, and I am ok with that."}
{"text":"Was an avid Pizza Hut customer for a while but started getting disappointed with the service. So I decided to try Papa Johns and I must say I'm happy with the price and quality of the pizza. If I could give it 3 stars and a half I would. They definitely earned my business and I'll continue to order when the family wants pizza."}
{"text":"I am giving you 1 star not based on your pizza but rather your staff. As one of your drivers was driving recklessly nearly hitting me and a few others when calling your facility your staff did not even seem to care. What ever happened to having a little pride where you work?"}
{"text":"I don't get Papa John's very often because I'm not a fan of their prices, but I really do enjoy their white Pizza. I did carry out...just seemed like it had been sitting for a long time, wasn't very hot. Had to wait for quite some time before anyone greeted me, when they finally did greet me they were friendly."}
{"text":"It's 2:45 on Sunday.. The online app doesn't work. I order from store for a delivery and \"he\" says 2 hour wait. WHY would you ever tell a customer its a \"2-hour wait\"??? CLEARLY Papa John isn't a good business man. Won't be ordering from there ever again! #NoExcuse"}
{"text":"This is a great store.  Answered quickly, took my order, and exactly what I wanted.  Pizza and wings waiting foe me when i walked in 15 min later!"}
{"text":"I ordered online from them and went to pick up my pizza. I ordered in the afternoon so it wouldn't be a rushed order either. I picked up my pizza, which was actually a simple and friendly process, and went home. I ate two slices and was working on my 3rd when I pulled out some type of branch-looking apparatus. I looked over the rest of the pizza and kept pulling out more of these items. I was apalled! I took it back and showed the cashier girl. She got the manager who then came out and said \"Oh that must have been packaged in with the mushrooms.\" I don't care if it was packaged in with the cheese! It's not supposed to be on my pizza that I'm going to put in my mouth! He was very hesitant to offer me another pizza. I figured I was being simple and easy going considering I could have asked for my money back, another pizza, and raised a huge stink about the whole thing. Anyway, this is all I need to be shown to say I'm never coming back here."}
{"text":"This review totally bums me out!!!  My order was supposed to take 30-40 minutes and showed up an hour late, cold, was missing my extra pizza sauce that I ordered and the delivery guy was your saving grace!  He didn't have my Mt. Dew either and actually went to a convenience store to pick it up!!!  He apologized over and over about something he had no control over.  It wasn't his fault and he was a great representative of your company in a HORRIBLE situation.  If this order ends up being billed please expect a phone call from me because this is not at all what I was expecting.  Especially from Scottsdale!"}
{"text":"If I didn't have to give it to start I wouldn't . Ordered a pizza online and received a call from someone from the shop and they said they didn't have the brownie cookie. So I was like that's fine and the guy HUNG up On me. An hour past I call and asked the guy where our food was. He said the guy was on his way. Waited 20 more mins and called back. The guy on the phone was like I can't get ahold Of my driver. Was super rude and abrasive cancelled my order and went to dominos."}
{"text":"Called to order delivery to a store 1.5 mls away... got redirected to another store who redirected me back to original store.. told them they wouldn't take my order so they directed me to another store, called them & got redirected back to the original store again (4 calls to 3 different stores).. when I told the original order taker, politely, that the other stores said pebble creek should deliver to me he was silent for a couple seconds, confirmed my address, and then asked to take my order in an irritated tone.. I wanted a special for 2 toppings.. all pepperoni, half olive, half sausage.. was told no that half n half was considered 3 toppings and was extra charge. Said forget it. Pizza Hut doesn't play these games haha but seriously this is about the 3rd out of 3 annoying experience w pebble creek so I'm done."}
{"text":"Papa Johns Pizza says it all. I was in the mood for fast pizza and gave this place and their pizza a shot.  I have had Pap Johns in the past but nothing in recent memory as I like to try other local joints than big chains most of the time.  So, overall it was what I remembered, OK, nothing special and it met the need for fast pizza."}
{"text":"Was quoted 22-32 minutes for delivery, after an hour called the store and was told driver was on our delivery. After 30 more minutes called again and was told driver was involved in accident, and they'd remake and send out order again.   After waiting that long we cancelled the order. It's too bad the delivery person got into an accident, obviously hope everyone is ok.  Maybe call the pending deliveries ASAP to let them know?"}
{"text":"LOL at this place for thinking it's okay to belittle someone who is sick over the phone. I placed an order for delivery and due to a raspy voice the cashier didn't get my correct number (not a big deal) till he got snappy with me because I needed to repeat my card number. I repeated with no problems and then he told me my address I requested didn't exist? Okay keep in mind this is a business as well. So I told the guy to just cancel my order since it was turning into a hassle when this should have been cancelled and he made a huge deal about it bringing up that my card was declined so I wouldn't get a refund. Hands down the worst customer service!"}
{"text":"Food is always late and somehow always manages to mess up my order!  Last order was 30 minutes late!  My last order I preordered for 1100, store opens at 1000, food gets here at 1130.  And...it's wrong!  Shocker!  DO NOT ORDER FROM HERE!!"}
{"text":"I haven't had delivery from here, but pick up service is good. Their pizza isn't great. Their service is good. They gave me a 50% discount just for asking. I've had better pizza for sure but I'll go back."}
{"text":"Well the pizza here is good. It is always fresh and hot. Best fast food pizza around. But the service was terrible!!! Took almost 2 hours to get my delivery and let me tell you I was not happy about that. They need more delivery drivers and maybe a better management team. I mean it's just pizza people."}
{"text":"What can I say and where can I start, hmmmm if I could give Nellis Papa Johns a -10 stars you bet your ass I would! ordered a pizza tonight for my husband and I 30 minutes BEFORE 11 PM even though online google has posted they close at 12 AM. 15 minutes late I get an email saying they cancelled my order because they couldnt reach me! WTF! Tried to call 10 minutes before 11 PM still, I called 10 times! No one answered. Fuck all you too! Will NEVER order from these bastards again!"}
{"text":"I order from this location every time we order pizza. After last night that will change. I have had a previous bad experience with them however it was fixed after two calls. This time the chicken came cold. It was just dumped in the little box and the pizza toppings seemed to all be on one side. Thinking its time to look for a new pizza joint."}
{"text":"First time ordering at this location and it was excellent, the female who answered the phone spoke loud and clear, was very descriptive about my order. Offered some of their deals, & the delivery was faster than expected! Got my order not even 20 minutes after I called. Excellent!"}
{"text":"OMG!!!! The only thing I can say is I found a fly BAKED IN MY PIZZA!!!! I will never ever order here again or even eat pizza again ugh!!!"}
{"text":"I love papa johns pizza; however, I refuse to order from this place again! I walk in to get my pick up order and the guy touch with his bare hands all over the pizza dough meets me at the register. After handling my money he goes right back to touching all the fresh pizza dough! He should have wash his hands, so unsanitary and disgusting!! Hopefully he had the decency to remember after he went to the bathroom!"}
{"text":"Worst pizza ever!. Bought 2 lg. threw one out. Hardly could eat one piece.  Even the raccoons wouldn't eat it.   Sorry papa john. I'd rather have Gino's pizza rolls and those aren't that good either.  Upsetting spent that kind of money and couldn't eat it. Should have listen to comments from Pinterest.  Sorry Pinterest for not listening."}
{"text":"Looking at the reviews would have deterred me from getting delivery if I read them before ordering. Luckily, my experience was not bad. Continuing with the nerdy theme of this month, my friends and I got together for a rousing game of Axis and Allies. Nothing induces hunger more than an epic recreation of World War II, so we called the closest place to deliver.   Placing an order online is the easiest method with little chances of mess up. Papa John's has a deal right now for one large specialty or up to seven topping pizza for $11. We ordered \"The Works\" which most places call a supreme. We also customized one with chicken, beef, sausage, onions, peppers, and jalapenos. With a delivery fee, taxes, and tip, it came out to $30.   They quoted a 40-50 minute delivery time and came a little early. The pizza was hot, crispy, and the taste was alright. The sauce is on the runny side, but the toppings were good quality. It was nothing spectacular, but good enough for a day with the guys."}
{"text":"They lost my order, and I had to wait an extra twenty minutes for them to remake the order. Won't be going back."}
{"text":"I ordered online with email confirmation at 5:47pm saying my pizza would arrive 27-37min. It's now 6:58pm.. over ONE HOUR later and still NO pizza?! When I call store say it's on way but who knows this isn't first time this has happened and the exact reason why I stopped ordering from Papa John's bc never arrives when stated making me late for work ruining my plans and just being an overall disappointment as usual. Very upset!!!!! Finally just cancelled when reached 7:05 pm"}
{"text":"It's \"fast food\" pizza, so I know what to expect. I really like their new Buffalo Chicken Pizza, hope it stays on the menu. This location has great customer service and never had a problem with my pizza. It's just not my favorite pizza in Vegas, that spot is reserved for Grimaldi's. But it's quick and decent pizza, good prices too especially if you have a coupon."}
{"text":"Worst service ever! Apparently their online service was down? An hour later their pizza did not arrive, no phone call, no pizza ... Nothing. . .  And a charged credit card. Horrible. Called the closest store to find out they cannot deliver. And my card will still be charged. NEVER AGAIN will I order from papa johns... I suggest you don't either"}
{"text":"Jenn is the manager. Poor thing had to pick up slack for the other stores in the area that apparently have no communication. If you want papa johns pizza, order. And pick up here..... This store is reliable unlike the others in a 10 mile radius..."}
{"text":"Ordered delivery. It was excellent. On time,  as ordered,  very hot & fresh. I'd have given 5 stars if we'd had as much extra sauce as we prefer but as long as hubby is happy I'm happy."}
{"text":"Come here so frequently that they know my order just by looking at me. Always friendly customer service, especially from the Manager. My go to place for pizza!"}
{"text":"the pizzas so yummy!!, but this store is really disgusting! the dirtiest place I've seen in my life, in another part the lousy service, they treat you as if they did not want to sell, I'm a manager in a restaurant and I would never let this kind of thing bypass, I hope my comment helps the owners to be on the lookout"}
{"text":"If I could I would give zero stars ..I order for delivery I usually order really late because of work I know they are about to close and I feel bad that's y I always top 10 bucks on a 15$ order .i have asked every time not to ring door bell but every time they still do and get this I ordered two pizza and there not cut rally ?"}
{"text":"I wanted an XL pizza and was told to go online and order. So I did, but there was no option for an XL pizza. So I call back and let her know there is no option and she said \"You want our technical support number?\" I was like \"Do I really need do that just for a pizza? Your manager can over ride it on your guys end\" which I knew they could. She put me on hold and told me talked to my manager and said it was fine. She did not have good customer service skills what so ever. She also was talking very low and was talking to me like I was her friend?"}
{"text":"Came in for some pizzas , everything was very good , was a busy day with national donut day (donuts were free) staff was very friendly and helpful especially Anna"}
{"text":"No stars. Terrible. Horrible service. Pizza always arrives cold. This time cold and burnt. I have complained get a promise of a coupon for next time. I received one with and invalid code. Called corporate still waiting. Papa johns really needs to manage their franchises"}
{"text":"I have ordered delivery from this place a few times and Ive never had a problem. I always order online but I called them today for the first time to order from this coupon we received in my email. when i told the employee on the phone that it was a coupon he said it was valid only for carry out orders, we placed the order any ways and he said it would be ready in 30 minutes. Not even a minute after hanging up I tried to call them to add one more topping on a pizza and they put me on hold before i could even say anything and i waited for about 15 minutes before i just hung up. I didnt bother trying again since i figured by now my pizza was probabbly cooking. When we went to go get the order it had been about 40 minutes since we called, the first thing I see is an employee smoking right next to the front door! Gross! When my husband goes inside to pick up our order they tell him our pizza was accidentally delivered to another house. But we could wait about 25 minutes for them to make our order again . Umm what!?!? So my husband came in the car and told me what happened as we drove off. I called them to complain about what had happened and again when they answer they try and put me on hold right away. so i asked him how long it would take because the last time i called i waited about 20 minutes and i had to hang up and all he said was oh ill be right w you and put me on a brief hold. He answers right away and i complain and ask to speak to the manager and Joey said he was the manager and he was sorry but he could make our pizza in 20 minutes we just had to pick it up. i asked if he could deliver it for the inconvenience, he said he couldnt do that for us and that we would have to go pick it up if we wanted. I got a little upset and asked why if he just messed up my order and i didnt want to go back again for my food and go through the same thing. He then told me he really couldnt deliver it but  he would give me my order for free as long as i picked it up... How in the world would you offer to give me my order for free instead of just give me delivery ? When im telling u my problem was not wanting to drive back there and wait... Lmao"}
{"text":"Don't order from this location for delivery. They take over an hour to deliver regardless of what the web site says. Lady who answers phone is rude and hung up on me. If they run their shop this way I'm sure it also isn't clean and wouldn't trust their food either."}
{"text":"I had been very pleased with this location until I received an unsatisfactory pie. I tried to reach the store, which I understand they are very busy so I emailed. I was surprised how fast mr. Ferdenzi  the area supervisor responded. He was very apologetic and offered me another which was above and beyond. I received the replacement and ate a couple of pieces and noticed  what I thought was cheese in the center of the pie was sticky. It turns out the dough was raw. So again I contacted Mr ferdenzi via email. I have tried two additional times to reach him to no avail. Needless to say I will no longer do business with them."}
{"text":"Highly disappointed with service and quality. Pizza was cold, smashed and with incorrect toppings. It also arrived late. I won't be returning."}
{"text":"One hard working red head all by herself on game night was extremely helpful.  She quickly made our pizza and wings. While keeping a smile on her face she busted her butt to complete orders left and right. I was in and out quicker than expected. This girl deserves a kudos."}
{"text":"Called in a delivery order from this location and it was late. I called them to see what was going on and they said they would get to me soon. I told them if the pizza was cold when it arrived I'll send it back. The manager said \"OK\" and hung up the phone. I ordered Pizza Hut the next time I wanted pizza."}
{"text":"Consistently good food and good service.  Love the online ordering."}
{"text":"$40. $40!!   One large pizza with two toppings, a small cheese. and eight of the smallest wings I have ever seen in my life. Seriously, neighborhood lizards are missing their arms. That's WAAAAAAAY too much to charge.  The large pizza was cut all funky so we ended up with four huge slices and four baby slices. The cheese placement was jacked up too... half of the pizza had a 2\" crust and the other side had a 1\" crust. It was weird.  We will not be ordering from them again. What a waste of money!!!"}
{"text":"Ordered online.....it's been an hour and a half and I just called and they said it's on the way. My email confirmation said 30 minutes. Good thing I already tipped them online for crappy service."}
{"text":"I called to order a pizza from this place and the guy who answers the phone hangs up on me after I ask him if he delivers to my address doesn't even let me say my address. And I'm not going to be disrespected from a worker at a place where the pizza isn't even that good it's so greasy that when you try and get the grease off it takes seven paper towels. This guy just said we don't deliver to your address right now didn't let me get in another word without even saying sorry he just hung up didn't seem to mention that the Papa John's that does deliver to my address was in University Heights thanks. never ordering from this place again."}
{"text":"This location is good at the only thing that matters; making pizzas. This location does not skimp on the ingredients like some others."}
{"text":"For first time I ordered from this location, first I called in to give my order, the guy put me on hold forever then I did online and went to pickup, the guy was rude, I ask for garlic sauce he gave me free, then I ask for another and I offered to pay, he charged me for both then. What about the free one? Or just don't offer a free then. Pizza was okay. It's says rated # 1 customer satisfaction, highly doubtful. Pizza dude you read this, I don't know what hardship you go thru, I ain't or any customer needs your rudeness, least pretend to be nice at work or get a suitable work."}
{"text":"Just received my ice cold pizza took an hour and a half no apologies from the driver told me it just came out of the oven 10 minutes ago I showed him my phone why made the call at 2:41 and he arrived at 4:15 and how the pizza was ice cold still no apologies do yourself a favor don't order from here"}
{"text":"This is definitely our preferred PJP when it comes to proximity. Although this one is slightly further than our closest one, on Ft. Apache, the service and quality of the food is remarkably better! We have consistently had very polite and friendly employees greet and take care of us at this location. The pizza has always been fresh and although it is your typical PJP they do a good job of it. Use this code today or tomorrow and a Large 2 topping is only $7 CODE: eblstlg"}
{"text":"Prior to my 1st review this PJP had very erratic service and quality of food on several different occasions, prior to Yelping. With that in mind we tried them again and were left with an OK impression. However, we did carry out there this evening and were worse than disappointed. I waited at the counter for 5 minutes with several employees walking by without so much as a word. When I finally got someone's attention the guy was half ass in his attempt to act like he even cared. After paying for the wings & pizza we ordered he tossed the wings on the counter and walked away. I had to flag him down and tell him we ordered a pizza as well. We got our food home to find the pizza miserably cold and the wings to be incredibly over sauced. I will NEVER go to this PJP again!!! If you want a great PJP experience I suggest the one on Blue Diamond, we've always had great customer service and quality of food at that location."}
{"text":"Delivery time over an hour. I ordered during the game, but it was still an excessive wait. The pizza, however...still delicious."}
{"text":"Ordered pizza here, it was decent. However, the employees were all young kids who failed to impress me when I entered the store to pick up my order. One employee was stuffing his face with pizza behind the counter, while another was smoking a vaporizer. I waited at least 5 minutes before the girl up front greeted me or even acknowledged me. This was for a big family dinner and non of us will ever be returning to papa johns due to this. Hopefully management will do something about this and get some kind of manager to keep the store clean and make sure the employees are sanitary. Better ingredients, better pizza, papa johns......not so much."}
{"text":"Never eat here. For me the girl that took our order was rude, ditsy and kept interrupting. On top of the pizza being nothing special (little Caesars 5$ pizza is way better) the large 1 topping was 20$. We asked for a few ranches and a bunch of crushed peppers. We received 1 ranch and 1 little tiny packet of peppers for a whole pizza. Ridiculous. I'll never return to this location. Called the manager to complain and he didn't give a damn. This place sucks and has crappy pizza and customer service. The delivery driver was cool"}
{"text":"Recently moved to the area and decided to grab some pizza on the way home. First time ordering from here and ordered two thin crust pizzas. The pizza was good and when I picked up my order I had my toddler with me who was a little fussy and the lady was very nice and told me to go ahead and get my daughter in the car while she put my order together and then brought it out to me. Great customer service!"}
{"text":"OK. So apparently some yelpers think reviewing chain or fast food restaurants is gauche. Well, bully for them. To each is own right. Me? Sometimes after a 12 hour day at work my empty stomach gets home to an empty fridge. Papa John's is open til 1AM. Hey, for Phoenix, that's pretty damn good. And while Domino's crust is similar to the cardboard disc that a frozen Tombstone sits on and Pizza Hut dough has more yeast than a yeast infection. Papa John's drives it home. Literally. Tangy, sweeter tomato sauce with crumbled, non grizzled Italian sausage and a perfect amount of cheese on a thin crust. My tummy was happy. I ordered it on line at work and when I got home I waited about 10 minutes before Papa showed. But I have my own name for him. I call him Daddy John. Oh yea. Thanks Daddy!"}
{"text":"Bummer... Wanted a Pizza on Friday night and trying to find the Sausage & Canadian Bacon on our Large Pizza! Thin crust was good!"}
{"text":"i called to order pizza, they were very polite. but when we got the pizza it tasted terrible and the wings are so small and taste lousy.. the thin crusttaste like crackers. the pizza was greasy and tastless. im giving it one star due to the awful tasting pizza and wings. sorry papa going to stay with barros...."}
{"text":"This store really knows how to make a customer feel appreciated.  After having a negative experience with a morning order, Levell (spelling?) the general manager took the time to personally call me, apologize for the mishap, and even offered me a free pizza on my next visit.  I appreciate that they recognized the problem and worked to find a solution.  Well handled!"}
{"text":"I LOVE their garlic butter dipping sauce.  The pizza is really good too, but if I could dip everything in their garlic butter I would. YUM!"}
{"text":"We called in an order for the first time here a short time ago. The guy on the phone was thorough and reviewed the order to make sure it was correct at the end of the call.   We were told it would be 30-40 minutes but it arrived in under 30.   The pizza was warm and delicious and the correct order."}
{"text":"I could have just bought a frozen pizza and cooked it in the hour long time it took for the pizza to get here and it would have tasted a million times better. The pizza showed up and all 3 very hungry people did not eat it because it tasted like cardboard and was already cold by time it got to our door. Last time I ever order papa johns even with a coupon not worth my time or money or disappointment at the end of the day"}
{"text":"Im giving this location 4 stars over customer service i received from Andrew. I often order from the app but this time the app messed up my order and did not show some of my order that was paid for when submitted.  I called the customer service line that was completely useless.  Andrew not only went over and beyond to fix the issue , he also made sure that it was all there."}
{"text":"I called in an order for pickup. 1 large 2 topping pizza. The total was 16 dollars and some change.. I thought ok, their large must be pretty big. Nope.. tiny ass pizza, like 14\". Am I crazy here or is 16 bones for a 14\" round piece of bread and cheese fucking insane? Never again-"}
{"text":"The employees are not aware of the outside world. When ordering, they constantly put you on hold. They are not aware of any deal Papa Johns is offering. They also hung up on me numerous times.   Also, they're credit card machine is always broken."}
{"text":"Once again, you cant beat Papa Johns pizza, especially when they are on sale. Quick online ordering & quick (usually) delivery. Pizza always arrives hot, as I ordered it, and tasty."}
{"text":"Maybe they use fresh ingredients but their crust sucks. It's too fluffy as pizza crust. I only get their pizza when I receive coupon code."}
{"text":"You want some pizza but you don't want the super cheap stuff or the really expensive stuff so there's the middle of the road. That's what Papa John's is to me.  This particular location is on the smaller side but as most people order for delivery I was the only one who came to order and wait for the pizza. The staff are friendly and efficient. I ordered a pineapple pizza. They told me it would be around 15-30 minutes. They had it done at 15 though which I liked.  I'm not a big fan of pineapple but I will eat it and my friends wanted it so that is what I got. There was plenty of pineapple spread on there so I didn't find the need to add extra pineapple though if you like extra then by all means go ahead. The original crust is what I went for and was cooked nicely.  I give Papa John's Pizza 3 stars for good staff and good food."}
{"text":"I signed up for the emails and rewards years ago so I could take advantage of specials and earn free pizzas and such. For as long as I've been ordering online, there has never been and still isn't anywhere to put a \"please prepare well-done\" option for their wings. I have called and asked how exactly I put this \"special request\" in with my online order, and was told to place the order and then call in. So, I always place the order online, then call and request well-done wings. Always. Every time. Mildly inconvenient, but the online specials and deals save you more money than calling in with an order. So, it is what it is. I placed my online order today and then called to request the wings well-done as always and was told by the man on the phone that he couldn't do that without canceling my order and starting over. And yes, I'd lose my discounts that way. I said I had been to the store before. It's rather small. Can't he just yell \"well-done\" to whoever is preparing the wings? As anyone would do in any other restaurant? He laughed and said they are extremely busy. I was a little surprised doing exactly what I had been told to do now suddenly doesn't work. I should have cancelled the whole order, but of course my kids would have been bummed. Instead I said I guess I'll cook the wings more when they are delivered. I was half expecting him to change his tune and tell me he doesn't want me to have to do that. Instead he said okay and hung up. Lousy to say the least. After all these years of loyalty, I guess I'm breaking up with Papa Johns tonight. Pitiful customer service. I will not be back."}
{"text":"Meh....meh, minus 1 star = 1 star!   My buddy and his family were in town, and we were planning on going to Grimaldis (He has never been).  Unfortunately, his daughter came down with some illness and was not about to leave the house.  Grimaldis was cancelled :-(  We were still in the mood for pizza though, and decided to hit up Papa John's.  It had been years since I have had any Papa John's, and there aren't a whole lot of great pizza options in Surprise.  Papa John's had a special running for a large, up to 5 topping pizza for $9.99.  Not a bad price at all.  I decided to place my order online.  About that.............  I went on their website and and was playing around with different topping combos etc.  I had 2 pizzas in \"my cart\" but wanted to change them.  I clicked on \"edit\" and then made the changes I wanted to them and thought everything was good.  I placed my order, drove down, walked in and grabbed my pizzas.  While there, the guy read off what my pizzas were, and they sounded a bit off.  I'm not one to complain unless something is super fucked up, and these orders were not.  What had happened though, is that when I went in to \"edit\" my pizzas online, what it really did was add those changes ON TOP of what I already had on the pizzas.  So my intent was one plain pepperoni pizza, and one with pepperoni, sausage, onions and mushrooms.  What I got was a double pepperoni, onion, mushroom pizza and a pepperoni, sausage, onion, green pepper and mushroom pizza.  I like all those toppings, so I didn't bitch.  Took the pizzas home and dug in.  Here is how they were.........  Pizzas-  Meh.  First of all, they looked kind of sad.  The dough was incredibly thick and pretty white.  The pizza looked like it could have been cooked a few minutes longer to brown up the cheese, and crisp up the crust.  I took a bite in and was disappointed.  While I mostly agree with the saying, \"There is no bad pizza.\", this pizza was just not good.  It was probably the worst pizza I have had in AZ.  The crust was so thick and plain and dry, it was nasty.  The cheese and ingredients weren't tasty either.  I ate 3 slices (I was starving, too) and could not eat any more.  Nobody else really liked it either.  We even saved 5 or 6 slices from the pizzas, and they are STILL sitting in my fridge.  Yeah...that bad.  Pizza never makes it past a day in our house, but this is going on 3 days now.  Meh!  The employee at the pickup counter was friendly.  That is about the only good thing I can say about this dinner.  $20.00 for 2 pizzas is not bad at all, but the quality and taste was so bad, I would rather chow down on some Little Caesars!  Yeah....that bad!  I'm never coming back."}
{"text":"if you are looking for a pizza better then Pizza hut or Little caesers then this is your place...not much of a compliment but the pizza here is pretty ho-hum..."}
{"text":"Delivered the totally wrong pizza to me again. I must be an idiot to order from these guys. Young Woo's pizza is sitting on my counter cold, lol.  My pizza is on his??????  Forget the national advertising these local guys can't run a business."}
{"text":"Papa John's is my favorite pizza delivery place.  I've never had an order messed up, and my pizza has never gotten to my house cold, or late.  The service quality is very consistent, and the flavor is leaps, and bounds better than Pizza Hut, and Domino's.  There are always tons of promotions, so the prices are very fair.  Lately, they've been having the $10 for any large pizza (including specialty pizzas) promotion.  I hope they make it a regular thing, because that's an awesome deal."}
{"text":"If there was a zero star option I would choose it. I've had two horrible experiences at this location one involving the GM of the location verbally threatening her me. I spoke with the Regional manager who stated the GM was \"on vacation and being transferred to a different location\". Horrible customer service. Horrible employees."}
{"text":"This is the best papa johns I've ordered from. I order from this location at least twice a month and its always delicious and on time. The delivery drivers are  always very friendly and I've had several different ones. I wish all papa johns were like this one."}
{"text":"I'm simply basing this on the pizza, I wasn't actually in the store... they have pretty darn good pizza. We ordered a bunch of it for our youth group event at Airworx next door.... nice, hot, and tasty pizza... what more do you expect?"}
{"text":"I seldom eat pizza, but when I do it's almost always Papa Johns! It's like Goldilocks would say... it's just right! Their crust is better tasting than Domino's, it's thicker  than a thin crust, but not greasy like Pizza Hut's.   What do I like most about this place? For starters, their prices! I can usually get a large pizza for around $10. Yesterday I snagged a deal for tax week - $10.40 for a large 3 topping pizza and an order of bread sticks.  They have a rewards program, which is always a bonus for me. You get 1 point for every $5 you spend, and 25 points earns you a free large pizza with up to 3 toppings.  I love their website, it's super easy to use and as a person who loves to order 1/2 and 1/2 pizzas it's a breeze to enter which toppings on which side. I regularly order the same thing and it lets me save my order for future orders which makes it even easier.  The staff is friendly and the drivers are courteous. I've never had to wait more than about 40 -45 minutes for an order to be delivered.  As a tip: You can get $5 off a future online order of $14 or more by simply taking a photo of your pizza and e-mailing it to them at papaspizzalv@gmail.com"}
{"text":"As far as Pizza places go, not including the private mom & pop places I would prefer to frequent, this is certainly the better of the chain establishments.  A Pizza Place would not normally be an establishment I would rate but their service demands it, so here we go.   After signing up for their web alerts and getting coupons, specials and some pretty amazing deals, I am sold on their ability and desire to keep the customers happy and returning regularly.    Last week, I received an alert that I had won a pizza in their weekly give away so I decided to use the awarded points immediately and get a pizza and some wings.  Ordering on line is simple and a confirmation email is always sent.  Their site is user friendly and seems to offer everything needed to have a complete meal.    Getting there was fast and the most impressive thing was that when I arrived, the complete order was ready, no waiting and I was out in under 30 seconds.  Back at the office, it was re checked and nothing was missing.  Perfect.    That day we chose a Chicken and Pineapple pie, extra sauce, square cut, and normal bake time. A side of 10 wings was also added along with two dipping sauces.  All of it was great.  The perfect lunch that left me wanting to tell the world of the experience.    My recommendations are this:  Go to their website and sign up.   It costs nothing, coupons are constantly sent and its easy to use.  The other thing is you receive point-credits for each pizza ordered.  They add up and you get free pizza's for it.  Who could ask for anything better?  4 out of 5 stars as its no gourmet place, just inexpensive, hot, fast and delicious chain store pizza.  Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Today, Papa's was offering a large cheese pizza (with up to 8 additional toppings for free) to acknowledge the Arizona Cardinals 4 touch downs and win in yesterdays game.  What a great deal!!    We placed an order on-line several hours ahead of time for a 5:30 pick up at this store.    I arrive to get the pie and it did look wonderful as they always do, however my request for a square cut was not done.  The cashier graciously asked if I wanted to have another pizza pie made but I declined as there was not enough time in my evening schedule.    When it arrived a the house, it was still hot and everyone enjoyed it as always.  They really do make one of the better pizza's, two very enthusiastic thumbs-up for the taste and value ratings.    My overall rating for this store is only 3 stars as their on-line system has made mistakes in the past and this was no exception.  It has already been addressed with the corporate offices and I am certain it will be addressed and corrected.   Bottom line:  Great Pizza...great price, locations everywhere.  Take advantage of their specials as they cannot be beat!! Be cautious of the on-line ordering. ENJOY!!"}
{"text":"We ordered a pepperoni pan pizza and stuffed cheese bread for delivery.  We requested the pizza well done. We received a pizza that was undercooked, doughy and flimsy.  The pizza sauce is also very sweet.  The cheese bread was fair, nothing to get too excited about.  The delivery driver was on time and friendly. We also did receive all the items we ordered.  I was greatly disappointed in the taste and quality of food. We probably will not be ordering from here again."}
{"text":"Let me first start by saying that the online ordering was super easy. I was able to order during a conference and it was delivered right on time for lunch. The pizza tasted amazing although it looked like it was cut by Helen Keller. 5 stars for pizza taste. Where it was not so good was the preparedness of the delivery driver. When you deliver to a hotel, bring plates and napkins! You're killing me, smalls! 1 star for delivery. I still gave you a good tip because I knew that I was gonna blast you on here. You know who you are! Get your stuff together."}
{"text":"General manager Tony is a complete dick. I placed an order online 10 min before closing (my mistake for not paying attention to the time frame). I called and let them know that if it was too late they could cancel the order but he said they can still push it through and it would be 20 to 30 mins which was fine, after I said OK, he straight hung up in my face. I called back to inform him I wasn't done with my order - I was supposed to be put on a list by Randy for an order of garlic knots because the ones I received from my previous order were burnt af. Tony said I wasn't on any list, but probably didn't even bother to really check because it was closing. I really wanted those damn garlic knots. Screw your Tony"}
{"text":"As mentioned in my tip, definitely confirm the price before paying in store especially if you used a promo code or ordered online. The price discrepancy was almost doubled what I was expecting to pay.   Initially, I ordered a large 3-topping pizza combo with wings using a promo code through the online website. During checkout, it prompted that for $2 more, I can upgrade it to an XL (extra large) pizza.  Opting to pay in person upon pickup, I was shocked when the cashier noted a new price. Showing him the promo code, he initially said the promo code wasn't valid because I ordered an XL pizza as opposed to a large even though it was Papa Johns website that clearly stated the increase in price is $2, not $12! After some more back and forth, the cashier eventually enters the promo code.  Needless to say, the pizza and wings itself was of mediocre quality. The taste is sub-par to other pizza around the area, not worth even the promo pricing. Skip this Papa Johns and try elsewhere."}
{"text":"I love papa Johns. I have always had great customer service with the exception of this location. Got my order wrong, delivery girl basically threw the food at us and ran so we didn't realize until she was gone. When I called the girl who answered the phone was rude and put me on hold only to pick up and say she \"couldn't like do anything\" put me on hold for the manager who also didn't know what to do (perhaps have the driver turn around?! Or even apologize perhaps?) .   Hopefully we will be able to order from a different store in the future or corporate will get a handle on this location. Pizza is really good and vegan friendly so I would hate to not order from papa Johns anymore."}
{"text":"I do not recommend ordering delivery from this location. The last 3 consecutive times (and multiple times before those) my order came to me without any of the condiments I ordered and paid for. The manager will offer you a free pizza, to be redeemed in the future if you call and complain, however that doesn't help me when I don't have any of my dipping sauces to eat my food. I won't be ordering from this store again."}
{"text":"I love papa johns and it never fails me but this time it really annoyed me. I made a order with my points on my app but I forgot to change my adress so it was going to be delivered to my friends house.  I called and asked to please chnage the adress they said they couldn't but they  would cancel the order and for me to just place a new order so then I did, obviously with out a discount because I couldn't get my pints back which is fine but I placed my order again with the new adress but then I get a phone call from my friend saying they delivered the pizza to her house of course she sent it back but they still charged. Then I finally get my new pizza and it looks like it fell and  no one cared to check so it literally looked like somone shook the pizza and on top of that the pepperoni was on the bottom of the cheese and the cheese was just sliding completely off my pizza it was a mess. And I'm extremely disappointed."}
{"text":"Felt like trying out papa johns since we live right next to Pizza Hut and that's usually the convenient place to order from. Plus all the football games playing and the .50 promotion I gave it a shot until I found these long stands of hair in the pizza. So I called and spoke to Karen the supervisor that was unapologetic and truthfully could careless. Her concerned seemed more focus on answering the phones. She did what most people would and offered me a refund and credit or new pizza. I'll never order from that place again."}
{"text":"Pittsburgh's got so many great locally owned Pizza joints, why would you order this awful, I can't even call it Pizza, pizza.   Sickening sweet sauce. The only thing worth ordering off the menu is the bread sticks. Seriously order from a Mom & pop pizza parlor. Do you a favor."}
{"text":"Horrible service and experience. They don't know how to tell time everything is five minutes. Can't think outside of the box."}
{"text":"This location messes up orders with ridiculous consistency. Order garlic parm breadsticks and get dry breadsticks. Order a thin crust square cut pizza and get a regular crust half square half triangle cut pizza. Order chicken and get no chicken. I'm done. Supporting local pizza places (who care about having repeat customers) from now on."}
{"text":"*BUYER BEWARE*  Worst experience ever! Customer service here is the worst! My credit card was charged 3 times for $17 I ended up paying over $50 for one pizza! To top it all off when the driver arrived she had the completely wrong order! She tried to lay a pizza on me with no cheese! But I called the manager immediately and was told my order was never processed and I was SOL. Somehow my order was never \"ordered\" but they delivered it to me!? Makes no sense. Austin the supposed to be manager was rude and pretty much said there's nothing he can do! Don't worry I called corporate and got my refund and 4 free pizzas! Lucky for the homeless guy on the corner he got my free pizzas because I will never go back!"}
{"text":"We usually do delivery but decided to pick it up while we were out tonight. It's like a mad house in here. First, the young man who took my order did not have the best manners...\"what?\" and \"yeah\" responses. Augh! Then when I come in, I find what looks like a frat party! The cashier was gracious and made conversation. He was also apologetic for the extended wait. Then I look around and see employees' drink bottles in the food area! Yikes! Then another teen is on his phone texting in the cooking area. Too many red flags but I love PJ pizza...  We got home and started enjoying our pizza. On his next-to-last slice, my older son pulls out a piece of hair that could clearly not be any of ours (totally different texture and length). We were disgusted.   I called the manager. She was gracious and offered us a free pizza on our next order. I doubt that I would ever be able to make my husband order again. She was kind enough to refund our money. I am appreciative of the customer service. Just wish I had listened to my gut and let all of the warning signs turn me away before a hair made it to our table."}
{"text":"Omg! Gross! We ordered pizza and chicken wings, we noticed that one of the workers who turns out to be the manager is wearing a bandage wrapped around her hand (Rita). We continued watching her go from the register to prepping Pizza.  I asked her why she was prepping food without a glove. She said \"well I have a bandage it's better than the open wound\".  She claimed that she had been watching her hands all day long. However her bandage looked filthy on the bottom.  It was a Coban wrap.. by the way it looked, there was no way she had even washed her hands with that wrap.   We asked her why she wouldn't wear a glove and she said she didn't think it was mandatory.  I hope no one gets sick from eating there. We got our money back and couldn't get out of there fast enough! Gross gross gross!"}
{"text":"Their tag line, \" better ingredients, better pizza, Papa John's\", should be changed to \" better pizza, horrible service where the manager hangs up on you, Papa John's\"! I was sent an email with a special discount. I followed the link and ordered a pizza for delivery. Like I've done a dozen times before. I'm sure they drivers remember me, I tip well. The promised time of 19-29 minutes seemed great. Ordered at 7:23pm. At 8:20 pm I called to ask about my food. I was placed on hold immediately. 4-5 minutes. The girl finally picked up and I asked about my dinner, gave my name and address.. she seemed confused. She said the address they had for my order was next door to them and they cancelled it. I asked \"why didn't you call me? you have my number.\" She couldn't answer, but said she would get a manager. The manager, no name offered, came to the phone after a solid 4 minutes. (This call is now 10 minutes long). In a nut shell he said they thought it was a prank call and cancelled it.  I gave him my address, name and even offered my customer number from the web order. He didn't care. He was equally silent when I asked why didn't he call me to confirm the address? He responded with blaming me for the mix up and HANGING UP ON ME! No apologies,no offer to correct the error. He just hung up. This is not the first time I've had issues with this store. It will be the last. There are 3 other pizza places in the immediate area, they now get my business and money. Good bye Papa."}
{"text":"I don't know what all the bad press is about this papa johns.  We have been ordering there every weekend and the pizza is always fresh and the staff is always kind and friendly.  As I expect that from a restaurant I never felt the need to actually review them.  I can't help it my standards are high :).  This past weekend was my first less than stellar experience.  I called when I was shorted a couple of wings and not only did they refund me but they offered to remake it on my next visit.   Now that is what I call going above and beyond.   To the manager William I thank you for providing excellent customer service and appreciate you and the staff.   Also if you haven't try the Honey Chipotle wings.   They are OUTSTANDING!"}
{"text":"We experienced excellent service at its very best.      Most often real customer service happens where we experience a problem.   I ordered pizza for carry out.  When I arrived at the store they informed me that my order was misplaced.  Without hesitation the manager. ( Blond as making pizza) quickly offered to enter a new order and provide the food for no charge.   I happily waited as they made fresh pizzas.     I will be back for years to come"}
{"text":"I ordered online at 9:20 pm on Wednesday night 9/21/2011. An hour and a half later (with no pizza) I called to see how much longer it would be.  The employee informed me \"any minute now\" the delivery guy already left. At midnight (over 2 1/2 hours later) I called them back upset to cancel my order. The employee was rude and short and gave no explanation or apology. Seriously?"}
{"text":"Just like most other Papa Johns.  Nothing to really brag about, but I don't have any complaints either.  Friendly and quick."}
{"text":"Love Papa Johns Pizza but kinda sucks when the delivery time is over an hour and half. But it's cool, I'll just go pick up the pizza, right?? NOPE! Can't pick up the pizza, delivery only... It's 10:40pm by the way. Ridiculous. Dominoes it is! Not cool Papa. Lost my business."}
{"text":"Gave us a coupon to use based on incorrect order. Tried to use coupon just a few weeks later and said this store does not accept that specific coupon. So why did you give it to us? Won't deliver to us even though we're only 1.4 miles away. Not worth the hassle just go to NYPD. At least the second time the pizza was made correctly."}
{"text":"Ordered a large pizza with extra cheese for take out last night.  The pizza was smaller than most large sized pizzas. The crust was like cardboard and there was very little cheese. $15.00 for a very lousy pizza."}
{"text":"Today was my first time ordering delivery from this location and my pizza was never delivered.  Checked my phone, and saw there was a missed a call from the delivery guy. Literally within 5 minutes from the missed call, I called back twice. The delivery guy never answered. There was never a knock on the door nor was the door bell rung. Very disappointed long time customer."}
{"text":"I ordered wings for delivery tonight and the order was 20 minutes late (it's a Wednesday night so I doubt they were busy) and they gave me barbecue when i ordered hot wings."}
{"text":"Love their thin crust pizza. Definitely tastier than the ones from Domino's.  It's recently changed management."}
{"text":"I ordered the Heart shaped pizza and it was probably the worst pizza I've ever received from papa Johns (And I love your pizza). Not only did I order a pepperoni and received a cheese - when I called to ask for the pizza I ordered, I proceeded to tell them the pizza was burnt and cold. I also did not get the garlic sauce I paid for and asked for the one I paid for. The store told me I had to return the pizza they delivered and I would have to pay half price for a second pizza. I could even hear the manager in the background telling the girl I was speaking to what to say. Why would he not want to please the costumer when his store got my order wrong? I said never mind and will never order from this location again. Poor customer service."}
{"text":"We're definitely fans of Papa Johns. This is the closest location to our home, so we get our carry-out from this location the most.   I would highly recommend signing up for their Papa Rewards program. I order pizzas frequently for clients online or on the iPhone app -- and pretty much get a lot of free pizzas with their rewards program.   Anyhoo - - this location has always been friendly, and the pizza's tend to be 5-10 min faster than the quoted time.   The Hawaiian Chicken pizza is good!! Love their cheesy breadsticks... mmm!"}
{"text":"The pizza here is always consistent. I never get anything I don't expect, which I think is a good thing. They make it really quickly and are always right on time about when it will be ready so that I can pick it up when it's just out of the oven! Everyone here is very friendly also."}
{"text":"Based on delivery driver in a beat up maroon ford.  Saw him speeding in a school zone and cutting off drivers turning right while he was takin g a left at the intersection. Unsafe and should be fired!"}
{"text":"Worst experience from Papa Johns. Pizza is over an hour and a half late. The response from the store is \"its going to be another 30 minutes.\" Family is visiting and hungry, what a let down from Papa Johns. This is totally unacceptable from this franchise. Get your store and employees in line and fix this problem. I guess Peyton Manning and Papa missed out on visiting this store. This will be the last time I give business to this store. You have not won me over with the way this was handled."}
{"text":"Love the cheese sauce. This location has great staff--we had a problem with our order and it was handled immediately, and we were even given a free pizza! Service went above and beyond."}
{"text":"Ordered some takeout pizza, 1 med. mushroom, and 1 med. meat lovers with my significant other about a month ago. Pizza was initially good, but left a salty aftertaste. Had some of the mushroom pizza. It was pretty tasty, so ate until I was full. The next day, I had a huge migraine along with nausea and vomiting, probably from the pizza. I rarely get migraines like that by the way, so I was surprised. My guy didn't have any side effects, thank goodness. I'm very suspicious that they use tons of MSG in their pizza, which makes some people sick. If anyone doesn't know what MSG is, they should google it. I'd stay away from ingredients like that. I will think twice before having any of their pizza again. \"Better ingredients better pizza\" isn't a good slogan, if they keep adding artificial preservatives and flavor enhancers that make you sick. Thankfully, the service was good, but will not want to have that horrible experience ever again."}
{"text":"The staff here is probably the nicest I've ever encountered in a pizza place while picking up my pies! They all welcome you and thank you on your way out as well! The pizzas are always well made and exactly what you expect from Papa John's franchises. Thanks for another great dinner save guys! You make being a single, working parent so much easier on nights like this!"}
{"text":"Ordered from here , my order was wrong and came an hour late. When I called in the manager Rick said he would just credit it to my account. Cool , when I called next to take advantage of it I spoke to Rick again who denied what happened, he confirmed that I ordered and he was working that day but refused to honor what he previously told me. Whatever, I was still going to order, until he proceeded to tell me how that couldn't have happened because he always takes notes, remembers everything and never makes mistakes! Wow! I don't like that type of arrogance nor such a poor customer service approach of not admitting wrong, loving up to responsibility, and trying to claim perfection. Decided to order somewhere else and will continue to do so as long as I live with in this locations delivery zone. The Papa makes some fresh pizza but this locations manager has a rotten attitude"}
{"text":"I like this papa johns idk why there's bad reviews. They always come fast. They messed up my order once but they fixed it on my next order thank you Faith and management you really know how to take care of us! We will continue to order from them."}
{"text":"I ordered a large cheese pizza, and an order of their delicious garlic parm breadsticks tonight. The delivery was incredibly fast and the driver was extremely nice; but the pizza wasn't exactly what I ordered with the app. With every pizza Papa Johns makes they give a small container of pizza sauce for dipping. Using the app I exchanged the small pizza dipping sauce for ranch dipping sauce, but instead they exchanged all the sauce on the pizza for ranch sauce."}
{"text":"We always use papa johns for our pizza night at our house but I think they have gone as far as they can go with us. This last time that I called to place an order for delivery. I was placed on hold for about 20 minutes. Ridiculous! We're done Pappa! Se la vi  Nobody should ever wait this long on hold for pizza!    Get it together pappa!   Who's doing the hiring here?"}
{"text":"This location was very disappointing. My pizza took 50 minutes(was quoted 30-40) and when it arrived it was cold and appeared to have been sitting for at least 30 minutes. What was the delivery guy doing? I can understand being last on a route but not sacrifice that much quality. I live 2 miles away from the location FYI. Never again."}
{"text":"Quite disappointed with my experience with this Papa johns, ordered a buffalo chicken pizza and it arrived without the buffalo sauce so it had to be sent back. I was also made aware that it was a new employee that had screwed up on the pizza. Even more frustratingly when it arrived the second time and I opened the box, the chicken appeared to be very lacking. In past times I've ordered this, I would estimate there was at least 2-3x the amount of chicken and overall the pizza appeared to be majorly lacking toppings. Several of the slices only contained one measly piece of jalepeno. It seems like the new employee did not know how to properly prepare the pizza and I wish it had been double checked before it was sent out. And when the pizza arrived the second time around it was already starting to get gold. Would not recommend this location"}
{"text":"I placed an order online for two large pizzas. 1- BBQ bacon and chicken with NO onions and 1- plain cheese. I was delivered a BBQ bacon and chicken pizza with onions as well as chopped ham. This is the 5th time in the past 3 months this has occurred. I call the store location and state my pizza was wrong. The gentleman answering the phone puts me on hold to speak with a Mgr. He comes back stating the assistant mgr made the pizza and does not recall if he put onions on it or not. So they offer me a credit towards a future purchase rather than correct the mistake or apologize. Upon which I say no thank you- because this happens each time I order and I will not use them in the future. He then proceeded to hang up on me mid-sentence. The customer service at this location is severely lacking and the incorrect orders keep taking place.  There is no ownership for their mistakes. I'm very disappointed with the service, professionalism and people that work at this location."}
{"text":"Ordered Medium Crust Spinach Alfredo Pizza with Chicken & Onions AND Chicken Poppers. Food was delicious and thank goodness it was because it's my first time. My delivery guy was very kind as well. Overall good experience."}
{"text":"What to try?  Their specialty pizzas.   Every pizza restaurant makes their pizzas slightly different and this goes the same with this pizza joint too.   I like their specialty pizza here but this time I was really excited to get my pizza for free. If you sign up for their points, you collect points every time you order pizza but from time to time, papa johns also offer points for free. Like a scratch and save event! This time they were giving up to 25 points for free. And when I provided the code I was provided, I was awarded 25 points, enough for a free pizza! I was thrilled!! Everyone gets different amount of points though so it's random.   I took an adventurous option of the pizza so when I was offered what I wanted as the base sauce for the pizza, I opted for the barbecue sauce. I thought the pizza was tasty except for the sauce. I thought the barbecue sauce was too sweet though so it makes the pizza taste like a dessert pizza. Keeping the tomato sauce option might be better for next time.   I also ordered the garlic Parmesan sticks, it's pretty thick dough sticks but the garlic Parmesan spread on top wasn't enough though. It's because the sticks are so thick so they need to add enough sauce to make it tastier.   LAST TIP?  Remember to sign up for their loyalty program so you can take advantage of the point system and sometimes Papa John does send you emails for free points...enough for a free pizza!"}
{"text":"I normally order on line. Pizza is good and delivered quickly however each time I ask the driver for crushed pepper and parmesan the driver looks at me like I'm crazy/weird!?!!  I was told I need to specifically ask for it when I place my order.  So the next time I ordered online I call and ask them.. nope the driver was not aware. The next time I put it under special instructions .. and again nothing  This is the last time!"}
{"text":"The only reason I continue to order here is because it's the only one that will deliver to my house. Every single time I have ordered from here my pizza has been 20+ minutes late. Talking to the managers (once you finally get to one after listening to the whole staff laughing/arguing with you about something), yes you're going to get a free pizza BUT it's also gonna be 20+ minutes. The ONLY reason to give this place one star is because their delivery drivers 80% of the time are very nice people and worth tipping. Tonight I ordered a pizza two hours ahead to be delivered at 8:45pm. Got here at 9:10pm finally."}
{"text":"I seem to always forget that this place is here.  We always seem to be ordering from another pizza place nearby, and I am almost always disappointed in the pizza.  On a recent Saturday, we decided that we would order from Papa John's.  I love being able to place my order online - the process was easy and hassle free, and I could even choose to pay by cash.  We ordered the large \"the works\" pizza and an order of cheese bread.  I received a confirmation e-mail saying that it would be 30-40 minutes until delivery.  I was busy watching football, but it seemed to arrive quicker than that, which is always great.  The delivery guy was very nice.  The pizza was delicious and the cheese bread was REALLY good. My Mom doesn't really like pizza (she's crazy), but she was raving about this.  It was a little bit more than other nearby pizza places, but it was worth it. I agree that I think the delivery charge is a rip off - you are making enough money off the pizza, why are you charging me for this? Greedy.  Overall, great experience and I look forward to ordering from them again!"}
{"text":"Great price and friendly staff, but why are all toppings on one side of the pie? Ordered one large with the works and a large sausage pizza. The sausage pizza turn out fine, however the combination pizza was jacked up with all the toppings on one side. Laziness? An oversight? Not sure but it's a simple task."}
{"text":"Pizza is fine, I just hate seeing Papa John's creepy ass and his weird sexual tension with Peyton Manning.   Overall: C"}
{"text":"Ordered online at 12:29pm for a carry-out, but we didn't get our pizza until 1:25pm. Apparently, they had to remake ours becolive screwed up the order - a simple olive and banana pepper pizza. On asking if there was anything they could do about our extended wait, they were unapologetic, and didn't offer anything to compensate. They seemed pretty understaffed on a college football game day.   Not worth the wait. We'll go elsewhere for pizza in the future."}
{"text":"I ordered my pizza at 9:30pm. I had to call the location because the website didn't work to place order. They said it would take 40-60 mins. When I order my food the person on the other line seemed distracted and very unhelpful. When I was done telling him what I wanted in my pizza , he told me the total and said okay we will be there. 1. I wasn't done ordering 2. You didn't ask me the form of payment. I felt like I was pulling teeth! Then I waited and the delivery guy in the mustang was handsome and nice ! the only reason why the location got two stars was because of him ! Focus on your customers and their needs ! Overall I won't order from here again! It was amazing"}
{"text":"Cashier was very rude. Will not return to this location again. Stay away!"}
{"text":"This place serves great pizza, but the service is slow and the employees are rude.  We recently ordered a pizza and it arrived incorrectly. We called and they gave us a hard time even though we didn't eat any of it. All we asked for was a new pizza and they didn't want to give it to us. Very disappointed."}
{"text":"Where do I start.  I ordered a pie for delivery about a month ago, and it got here late.  I didn't worry about it, but the driver did apologize.  Today, I received a coupon for a free large pie due to the last late delivery, so I thought I would use it.  To make a long story short, I should have just placed the order for pick up over the phone.  Apparently, phone orders trump walk in business at this location.  Even though I was the only customer for nearly 30 minutes, my order was placed dead last behind any phone order that was called in.  Dominos...Pizza Hut...Papa John's...it's all the same.  At least Dominos is hot and fresh to your door in 30 minutes.  We're in an Economic Depression.  I don't need to spend money at a place that has no customer service...and no comprehension of process.  Hasta, Papa.  You blow."}
{"text":"If you order delivery don't expect to get it... Spoke to driver gave explicit directions, they went to wrong place, called and told us to pick up our order.. cancelled order won't be back!"}
{"text":"Unfortunately the credit card dispute process took forever, but I did finally get a provisional credit back for the $23.34 I paid for the order I cancelled and never received last time. They were no help when I called the location to try to get a refund. I also sent an email to Papa John's customer service through their website about three weeks ago, and I have yet to get a response, much less an autoresponse to acknowledge they received my email. I just hope they don't dispute my dispute of the chargeback, and my provisional credit becomes final.  Let's just say I am pretty disappointed in what used to be good service. Now that Domino's got rid of their breadsticks (that I loved) and Pizza Hut changed their buffalo sauce for their wings, none of the chain pizza delivery services in my area are an option anymore."}
{"text":"Had an issue with the service and food here.  However, manager resolved it and I gave the place another try, and it was fresh and good.  So, if you like Papa John's then give this location a try!"}
{"text":"Ordered the valentines pizza special it was gross. It was the heart shaped pizza deal. Pizza was flat burnt, hard and cold upon delivery. First and last time ordering here. Not to mention the online ordering was so confusing just to utilize the coupon was crazy."}
{"text":"Best Pizza ever! Try the buffalo chicken pizza! Really great service and awesome delivery time! Driver sure earned his tip!!"}
{"text":"After a full day of fighting crowds and traffic, who really wants to cook? Not me. We ordered a pizza online. Papa John's had it delivered in 32 minutes, still hot and still fresh. Good flavor, good coverage of toppings. I'd order from this location again.  Tip: Check the specials before you pick your pizza. It's possible that you can get a deal for the same price or less."}
{"text":"The guy at the register is rude and doesn't know how to treat customers or count. Says he doesn't take 50$ on a 25$ order are you serious. And the delivery drivers take it all the time. Other places take it. Other people in there take it but him. Dumb"}
{"text":"30 minute wait for fast food?? I already paid so I'll have to wait it out! This place sucks!"}
{"text":"Ordered online and they still messed up order and didn't get extra cheese which i order because i dislike sauce spots. Pizza was not as full filling as pizza hut a couple of weeks ago  which tasted way better."}
{"text":"We ordered our pizza to be delivered to GCUs college of education. An hour after the order was made and hadn't been delivered I called to ask what was up. I was told the order was still sitting there waiting to be delivered. I said sorry since we won't be here after the next 15 minutes, I guess cancel the order. An hour later, the delivery driver calls me to ask where to deliver the pizza!   2 hours after we ordered they want to know where to take the pizza."}
{"text":"i just placed an order from out of state for a friends birthday just now. but my card was a temp card and didnt go through. but guy on the phone was really nice and patient and super understanding. kudos to you! even though no pizza this time but 5 stars for excellent people and services. i miss the old days when i always used to order from this papa johns. never disappoints~"}
{"text":"Same old papa johns to me!! They all taste the same so not much of a review I can give... The garlic sauce is the bomb !"}
{"text":"No stars. They answered the phone and put me on hold for over 35 minutes when I finally hung up. Using another phone, I called back and was told he couldn't hear me. I got in the truck and drove there. I was told the person answering the phone \"was deaf\". WTF, why is he answering phones if he is \"deaf\". This is not the first bad experience I've had at this store. The employees are running the store into the ground."}
{"text":"I've ordered from this place plenty of times and just experienced this. So After nearly throwing up I decided to call and inform them of what happened. Spoke to two supposedly managers one sounded like he was twelve and didn't know what to say the other supposedly manager said all three cooks there were males and don't have long hair. I mentioned to him that I took photos and this was in the dough and not on top of the pizza. So he continued to argue with me until I asked where is the dough made and he then mentioned that it was shipped in from a distribution center which makes sense why the hair was so long. The manager started yelling on the phone at me and said my manager hasn't been here for two days and I don't know what to do. WOULD NEVER ORDER PAPA JOHNS AGAIN!!!! DISGUSTING FOOD AND SERVICE."}
{"text":"I am conflicted about writing a review on a well-known chain but I was really impressed by their online ordering service. I needed to order pizza for my team at work and was able to submit my order online a day in advance. You can select the date and time you need the pizza by. This location opens at 11am on Fridays and need at least 30 minutes to complete the order. As a result, I specified 11:30am and I got a phone call at 11:25am, Friday, letting me know they were at my company's security gate. I was very happy that they were early. I don't know that I have EVER gotten pizza delivery early. The website is designed very well to allow you to customize your pizzas for half/half toppings, crust cooked a certain way, and lists all of the specials they have. And they had alot of specials! I loved that I could order however much of their garlic sauce that I wanted. Papa John's isn't the best pizza I have ever had but it was pretty good, priced reasonably and the order process/customer service was excellent. This location had it down pat. I highly recommend it."}
{"text":"The worst place to order pizza they will hang up on you like 3 times before you get your order in."}
{"text":"Papa John's Pizza is like your 3rd degree cousin. You know him, but sincerely don't care. You invite him at your wedding not because you want to, but because your mom forces you to. Same thing with this pizza. You may want something else, but it's right there so it's convenient."}
{"text":"Usually fast and delicious. I almost always order take out and use online coupons and deals that make it reasonably priced. I don't love how much they charge for extra sauce and how few cheese and pepper packets they give you. I ordered 3 pizzas, I might need a little more..."}
{"text":"Not bad. I mean it's a national chain so it's pretty baisc stuff. But compared to other pizza nearby, I get my pizza here."}
{"text":"I decided to order from here a second time after a delivery issue previously about a month ago or so and I will not be ordering from here ever again. Placed my order and I didn't receive it for an hour and 15 minutes. I called to see where my pizza was and was told the guy had left 15-20 minutes before the time of me calling (Which was an hour and 4minutes). I only live about 10 minutes away from this papa johns and there's no reason even if he did leave 15-20 minutes before me calling that it should've taken an hour and 15 minutes to get to my house. I bought it so my daughter and I could eat before I left for work but it didn't get to us in time because it came so late! Then on top of that when the pizza finally did get to my house her pizza was a sausage pizza instead of pepperoni but there was nothing I could do because I was already on my way to work, so then we were stuck with a pizza neither of us like. I would've returned the pizza and asked for a refund because at that point I was beyond done with this place. One time of extreme lateness can be forgiven but after I give you guys a second chance and you royally mess up again and don't even apologize for my waiting is a sign that I shouldn't order from here ever again."}
{"text":"Terrible staff n service!!! At least for tonight. The gentleman did not wash his hands after handling my cash before touching raw chicken and then cutting pizza after that."}
{"text":"I wish i could give 0 Stars. Tried their Pizza at least 5 Times before writing this review. Im a big fan of Papa Johns Pizza, but Not the One from this location!!! U can guess how recklessly they make pizza just by looking at it. They dump a can of Marinara Sauce which gives me a feeling of Swimming in a pool of tomato Sauce than eating some pizza. Pizza is under cooked at times.  Overall not even a average experience. Now i drive 3 Miles more to go to a better Papa Johns Location."}
{"text":"Ordered a pizza online tonight while watching the UFC fights.  My first Papa Johns order. Guess I wasn't paying much attention while ordering online and selected carry out. After an hour and twenty minutes I called and said hey where's my pizza.  Well they were SUPER nice, voided my online order and redid it for me.  Again this was my fault.  I love that high level of service and will definitely make this my chain pizza delivery place."}
{"text":"This is by far the WORST Papa Johns in Vegas. The management sucks as well as the staff. Completely clueless and braindead. They don't know what debit cards are, I asked them if they found a lost one (because I lost mine) and they were like uhhh uh uh? I don't know? I said can you check? Uh yeah I think? Plain stupid. I also ordered pizza one time online and accidentally selected pickup instead of delivery, I waited 2 hours for my pizza, then called and was told that I selected pickup and that they would not make me a new pizza or deliver it. My only option was to pick up the cold pizza that had been sitting there for 2 hours!! I said Okay fine I'll just go to a different one. Worst service ever experienced! I went to the Papa Johns off N Jones and they were fantastic. I will be contacting higher management in regards to the other Papa Johns. I'm making it my personal mission to have every last one of them fired. I wish I could give them NO STARS!!"}
{"text":"Best service! Staff is so kind and down to earth. Not to mention the pizza is amazing! So much better than the one on 4444 craig crossing (which I will never be going to again). Excellent service, thank you so much!"}
{"text":"Big plus: Easy online order. Ready in 20 minutes. Everything else was mediocre. We got a spinach alfredo, tomato and chicken pizza, which had a decent flavor, but juices from the tomato and spinach caused the pizza to become soggy and runny. Our other bacon and green pepper pizza was fine. Interestingly, 3 of us had no probem eating 2 large pizzas from here, whereas 4 of us couldn't finish the same size Garcia's pizza. It just seemed like the Papa J's pizzas were thin and light (not as in healthy, but as in lacking cheese and weight).  Overall, standard franchise pizza. Nothing memorable."}
{"text":"They screwed my order when I called them back they said I never placed an order. The guy on the phone told me to look at the box and make sure I was calling the right store. Kind of funny the order I placed is no longer in my history."}
{"text":"If I could rate this a zero I would.  I don't know what happened but this place is now taking over an hour to fulfill a pick up order of just two pizzas.   If you are in a rush DO NOT COME HERE."}
{"text":"Gets one star since I have to give one.  Horrible customer service.  Pizza delayed over 1.5 hours after a 30-45min quote.  Called twice and response was \"We got a rush.\"  Thursday night."}
{"text":"Called to place an order for deliver 26 minutes ago. After 12 minutes, someone picked up and asked for my number and address and said they needed to verify they could deliver here (2.6 miles from my house).  Waited an additional 15 minutes for them to tell me that they were confused about the address and they stated that is what took them so long with plenty of attitude. Asked to speak with the manager (Jessica) to ask what the deal was and she was shocked stating that they weren't even busy at all and that she didn't know this was occurring.  Bottom line, looks like the staff are a bunch of kids who just don't care about their jobs enough to perform them even half ass. Obviously will not be sending them any business just on principle alone,"}
{"text":"Pizza was a bit better than what it used to be. I ordered 2 pizzas, a thin 2 topping and regular crust 2 topping; I enjoyed the thin best. Had kids go in and get pizza; was missing one of the garlic sauces for one pizza."}
{"text":"ordered pizza at 9:01, at 10:28 they called and said they couldn't find our apartment... as I chuckled I asked them to confirm the address... yup they had it right and guess what, it is not an apartment.. the home is 30 years old  They asked me to wait outside for them.. at that point I cancelled the order. Waiting an hour and half, I wasn't about to have cold pizza too   Do yourself a favor and order from a location that provides good service."}
{"text":"I would give this location zero stars, if it was indeed an option. I order my pizza via telephone, and was told the total. My family arrived and was told they are not accepting $100 dollar bills unless the order total was within $20 of the change due. This is not posted ANYWHERE in the restaurant and was told there was nothing they would do to help me..  The professionalism is at the bottom of the bucket, not one employee is wearing a name badge. The male employee making the pizza dough at the front of the restaurant has long hair that isn't in a hair net or tied up.. Employees are ordered around by the manager in a disrespectful fashion, with little regard to customers being in the restaurant.  I will be making a formal complaint with the local health district and Papa Johns Corporations.  We will discontinue patronizing this business."}
{"text":"I love Papa Johns pizza.  Still, delivery is slow here and for the super bowl we waited 3 hours for our pizza and didn't get any sort of apology.  The staff was pretty rude on the phone.  But I will keep ordering because I think the pizza is worth it."}
{"text":"Our pizza has always been right and on time. I guess that's the way it should be but I never thought to yelp a delivery business."}
{"text":"Wanted pizza, thought we would give delivery another shot. I don't know why they even give out an expected delivery time. -1 star I would rate the food but it isn't even here yet estimated 30-40 minutes going on 70 minutes + now.  Update: called and they couldn't find my order, advised I have a confirmation number in my email  Couldn't use that - asked what location I ordered from Advised I ordered online it should pull up the closest one and asked if that was correct Was \"not aware of the online process\" Why not? Do you not work there? Is there a reason why you shouldn't be educated on how orders come in?  my order was at the 83rd and camelback location.  Called that location Wait 5 minutes on hold to be told they do not have an order for me Advised that I have a confirmation email with a order number They apparently can't search by order numbers Wait 5 more minutes on hold to talk to a manager. They did have my order, couldn't make it through the gate because I didn't leave a code which does not have an option to online.  Well why didn't you call me? Apparently I entered the wrong number which I'm 99% sure I did not. By the off chance I did the email states if there's an issue they would try to call if can't reach by phone would reach out by email.  Told them to forget about it. - the other star. Went to little Cesar's and got a hot and ready."}
{"text":"Restaurant review Often it is hard to review chain restaurants because they are a cookie cutter model which is similar across the board, however certain experiences can add or subtract from the experience. Don't get me wrong, I get pizza here for the garlic butter sauce. They continue to have deals on pizza such as 6.99 large 1 topping on the first Tuesday of the month or 9.99 any large pizza. Overall the quality is on par with any other papa john's. They don't skimp on the toppings and it is not made poorly. The main thing that subtracts from this experience was the cleanliness one time. I came home and opened the pizza box and found a gnat crawling around inside the box. I understand there are bugs in Central IL, but that is always concerning to find something like that crawling around. The other thing is sometimes the pizza's are done early and sit on the shelf without a heat lamp. This is a bit disappointing. Overall when if you like the dipping sauces and variety of papa john has then this is the place to go, however don't expect a spectacular pizza by any means.  Pros: Inexpensive pizza with coupon codes, fast, order through the app  Cons: Cleanliness, order and pick up in 15 min or it maybe colder than you would like  Hidden deals: Google online for coupon code.. My favorite is the 999EWM code for 9.99 pizza on monday-wednesday.

{"text":"Always super fast. Great pizza every time. You can order ahead and it will be there right when you need it. This is our go to pizza place. If you order online you get points for free pizzas, and who doesn't like free pizza!"}
{"text":"Love their quick, friendly service and that orders are always right! Have never had a long wait that wouldn't be expected.  Really love the ease of ordering online and signing up for rewards.  So great! All delivery drivers I've met have been good. Thanks!"}
{"text":"The website took my credit card number and order with a promise of text & email.  Here I am four days later & have still heard nothing.  I called twice to check the status of my order only to be put on hold twice.  Finally about an hour later I drove over only to find a cold pizza with everything clumped in the center.  There was nothing all around 2 to 3 inches from the outside edges.  They had already charged me so all I could do was tell them it was a terrible experience & not a good looking pizza.  (No offer of refund, they already had my money).  Avoid Papa John on-line & at least this location.  Never again for me.  I only gave them one star because there was nothing lower."}
{"text":"i just moved here and tried ordering a pizza. it was an odyssey and i wound up calling corporate. i got a call from regional manager and he fixed it. i called in another time and the staff was aware of the situation and took excellent care of me and my order. everything came out correctly. we have ordered twice more from them and it has been perfect each time. a small hiccup lead to several great orders. they really cared to fix it. TY!"}
{"text":"PJ's was the fifth pizza place I called to get delivery to my home in North Scottsdale. They delivered when the others would not. Great pizza too!"}
{"text":"Fantastic. These guys are one of the only places that deliver out in the country in kannapolis. Have placed multiple delivery orders through app with no issues. Pizza is always on time and quality of the food is 5 stars. Sign up for the rewards program you get a free pizza faster than you know, those points add up quick."}
{"text":"Boy if you don't have a coupon or a special out advertised. I think a medium pizza with mushroom and cheese pizza for $14.99 is expensive. that is like a gourmet pizza price."}
{"text":"Guys are dropping the ball, quotes 20-32 min from ordering to when I would have my pizza. It took and hour and 20 minutes and my pizza was cold when it got here."}
{"text":"Very disappointed ,ordered large and the tried giving me medium . Made them do them again  . while they where making them we seen the guy making our pizza reach for his phone  hope the manager puts the on check  once again very disappointed."}
{"text":"$19.73 for one medium 2 topping pie, but $18.12 for two 2 topping pies? Get dafuq outta here with that nonsense.  And, 65 minutes to deliver when the store is literally less than a block away on a Wednesday afternoon.  Shitshow. Total shitshow."}
{"text":"Three months after receiving the homophobic email from Christina Carter telling me that gays should take their business elsewhere and I still have not received an apology or acknowledgement that the way I was treated was not only wrong but reprehensible from anyone.  Meanwhile, Papa John's was in the news because Iggy Azalea ordered from them and her contact info was passed around to several other people who ended up harassing her.  Within 24 hours Papa John's offered an apology and said the offending employee was disciplined.  So I suppose if Papa John's abuses you as a customer, you can only expect an apology if you're a Grammy nominee.  (The fact that she was a STRAIGHT Grammy nominee probably helped too - would they have apologized to Sam Smith if the same thing happened to him?)  But still, it just goes to show that this is a company that makes a practice of abusing its confidential customer information using it in ways they shouldn't whether it be someone's phone number being given out to several people or an upper manager using your email address to send you a harassing bullying antigay email.  Clearly the lowest of the low and a place that if not outright boycotted, should be avoided all together."}
{"text":"My order was simple: two large pepperoni pizzas and a two-liter of coke. An hour and a half later, the driver showed up reaking of some herbal substance or other and forgot my coke. No biggie, but I called back to complain and I got hung up on. What's up with that?"}
{"text":"I love eating at papajohns because there is always a coupon or promotion that makes their pizza inexpensive, especially for the quality and amount you get.  Papajohns is one of the better large pizza chains (pizza hut, little Caesars).  However, it's never better than the small chains, like Spinatos or Nellos.  I have ordered from this location over 20 times.  I always buy my pizza on the internet so I can get pizza points.  When you get 25 points, you get a free pizza 1 topping pizza.  You can also always find coupon deals on slickdeals or on their website that helps you save more money.    As for this location, my pizza is always done correctly and quickly.  By the time order my pizza online, I am able to pick it up within 20 minutes and it's done.  The customer service is always good here too. They are always happy to give me plenty of plates or utensils.  As for the waiting area, there is only one bench to sit on, so plan not to wait there as there is not many places to sit.  This place only delivers and does carry out."}
{"text":"I have been ordering from this Papas johns for over a year, I say this just to give back ground.  I called in tonight a lady answered got my info...same phone number and address for this entire year.  She told me they do not deliver to my address.  I started to say you have been delivering to my address she hung up on me.  I called back got a gentleman, he asked my phone number, normally after I give my number they say is this ( then say my name) he asked how to spell my name, apartment number after several attempts of him not understanding I asked for a manager.  A woman got in the phone I ordered what I always do.  I always make sure to  specify no pepperoncinis in the box, the \"manager\" repeated the order.  The pizza came with you guess it Propagandhi in the box touching the pizza."}
{"text":"We went there on Christmas Day. They were extremely busy and yet they still got our massive order 100% accurate in less than 30 minutes. We picked it up and they were friendly and accommodating, even with the phones going crazy and the line."}
{"text":"Worst service!! Lady on the phone was so rude! Told me at 1015 it would be 25 mins and it's now 1116 and still no food! Called them to see what is going on and all they said was there closed and the pizza should be here 10 mins well when we got it it was all cold and they didn't even give me the right food but they said it was to late n we'd have to talk to the manager ass holes"}
{"text":"Always the best service and great, the inside is nice and clean everytime i get a delivery they are very curteous"}
{"text":"First, I waited over 1 hour for them to deliver the pizza but tipped them anyway since it was a hot day. Then, as I bit into the pepperoncini that was included, I found (to my horror) what looked like a dead caterpillar or maggot inside! (and yes, I took a lot of pictures for anyone who would like to identify what type of bug it truly is) I quickly called them to tell them to get rid of the whole batch so other customers wouldn't experience the same problem.  They apologized and offered me a free pizza, but I highly doubt I would ever return to even consider their offer."}
{"text":"It's been a long time since I've had papa johns. Been sticking with Pizza Hut mostly but decided to try something different. One of the worst pizzas I've ever had. Weird dried out cheese had no flavor at all reminded me of eating cardboard. Arrived cold from delivery driver. Two bites right in the trash never again"}
{"text":"I placed an order online for a pizza to be delivered to my school as a reward for some of my students. The order was supposed to be delivered within 26-36 minutes. After 45 minutes I called the store. There was no answer. I waited five minutes and called back again. It rang like 8 times before someone answered it. The girl that answered it was actually rather indifferent that the pizza was late, told me that they were waiting for a driver to come back and pick it up and that it would be at my school in five minutes. I knew that the five minutes was a totally bogus promise if the driver was not even at the store at the moment. Whatever...   I waited another half hour and the pizza had still not been delivered. I called the store back talked to the same girl. She told me the pizza should have been there already and that she would call the driver.   The pizza finally arrived an hour and half after I ordered it, after three phone calls, and totally cold.   Not only was it terrible service, and sub-par product, but there was not once an apology or an offer to make the mistake right. I will never order from this location again."}
{"text":"I don't know what's wrong with the person posting in march probably a domino's exec. Anyway, this Papa John's is really good. I've ordered here a dozen times and only a couple times has it been less than average. Anyway, I think the customer service here is good enough that if it's not satisfying, I'd just call the store and they'd correct the problem. These guys deserve props."}
{"text":"I just have a couple of pizzas carryout very good pies .  friendliest staff  I I had an online special two pizzas for 5 bucks each i there was a good amount of toppings nice and crispy the only thing the paper chinis is was too small  but who eats those things anyways I do I should ask for more I didn't realize to deliver fee was $3 now .. But I guess everybody's charging the same.. In general very good deal today good service thank you guys oh yeah danien the mgr was nice."}
{"text":"First of all, service was not friendly at all. Secondly, waiting forever. Thirdly, pizza totally burnt and did not want to be refired by Papa John. Really! Yes, really never come back after few years become repeater."}
{"text":"Placed an order over the phone. The most painful thing I've done in a long time. The man just wasn't listening to anything that was being  said to him.It took 10 minutes to order 2 pizzas and chicken poppers. Pizza was hot and poppers were ok. Pizza was worth the $9.00 paid for each with a coupon.  But not $18.00 each without a coupon."}
{"text":"Papa John's . . . \"Better Ingredients...Better Pizza\".      We know enough not to believe all tag lines.  They stuck their pizza peel---and their neck---way out on this one.    Ordered \"The Works\".   I'd call the one we got \"The Worst\".    Crust, sauce, cheese, and the few very small pieces of Italian sausage were just okay, but nothing else on it tasted fresh or flavorful.  Dry, paper-thin pepperoni (maybe just 10-12 on the entire large pizza), black olives (too intense---not a good pizza addition), minimal sprinkling of Canadian Bacon that didn't taste at all like Canadian Bacon but something totally unrecognizable, a dash here and there of very small pieces---in very meager amounts---of onion, green pepper, and mushrooms.     Never had a deluxe style pizza with so few toppings.  No more than \"after-thoughts\".  In quantity, maybe less than a half cup total and nearly as flat as a pancake.   A joke.   Papa John's has to find some way to pay for those expensive TV commercials, so short-changing on toppings might be the direction some franchise owners are being forced to take.   They're at the mercy of corporate---and those contracts they signed---so must contribute to advertising costs even if not too keen on it.    I'd be pretty scared right now, if I had one."}
{"text":"My main man grew up in the midwest, so the chubby little boy inside of him lit up when he realized we were in a Papa John's delivery zone. Personally, I'd never had it before recently, and it isn't my favourite pizza. It doesn't hold up well in the fridge (sup cardboard). But their wings are decent and their dipping sauce is flipping melted garlic butter, so yeah. They're A OK by me."}
{"text":"i ordered a pizza from these idiots and after waiting 45 min for the delivery i called them. they told me they should be able to have it there in another 10 min.  wtf!!!!! who wants a pizza thats been sitting on the rack for over 30 min.  do not go to this place !!!!!! spend your money at barrows and get real pizza."}
{"text":"Just had the district manager respond to my email.  Ordered delivery the other day, a small Tuscan 6 cheese pizza and wings.  The pizza delivered was the regular cheese pizza.  It was hot and very good. The next morning I realized it was supposed to be the Tuscan 6 cheese pizza.  There is a $4.00 difference so I wanted to let the company know I was sent the wrong pizza.  I wrote a quick email explaining that I received the wrong pizza.  The next day, I received  a call from the district manager.  He apologized and gave me a credit for a large pizza.  Great customer service and quick response.  Wasn't expecting anything free just wanted the few dollars credited back to me from the wrong pizza delivered, however, Papa John's management went above and beyond!  Will definitely patronize this establishment in the future!"}
{"text":"i was deliverd a piping hot pizza by a hot chick! wow!"}
{"text":"Never had issues with pickup. However delivery has been an issue. Ordered via the app with a comment saying that I was at a public place and that they would need to call when they arrived. So what do they do? Send a driver who does not have a cell phone in an unmarked vehicle and then try telling me he tried coming and it was my fault for not receiving my order."}
{"text":"Papa John's used to be my favorite pizza place until I got it from this location. It didn't taste good and it looked sloppy. But that's not what upset me. LIKE OTHERS HAVE EXPERIENCED,  I ordered a pizza and they delivered one with the WRONG TOPPINGS. I called to complain about my issue and they offered to send me a FREE PIZZA on the house...well first the pizza wasn't free I had to pay $3 plus tip AGAIN, and they didn't even tell me that over the phone. They even almost had my address wrong! Well I got the pizza eventually, and when I open the pizza box MY ORDER WAS WRONG AGAIN! I will never use my hard earned money to buy pizza from this place again! Can't believe I'm saying this about Papa John's but here in Charlotte it is the most confused pizza place I've ever experienced. You can have back ALL your Papa Rewards, Mr. John!"}
{"text":"Papa Johns is the only one of the big 3 chains that I will support.  Their pizza is by far the better of the 3, even with Domino's recent reinvention.  The sauce tastes better, the cheese is better and so are the toppings.    I always order online so I never deal with anyone on the phone anymore.  The delivery for this location is usually faster than expected and they the delivery person is usually friendly."}
{"text":"We ordered delivery from this location, they brought us a completely messed up order that couldn't even be eaten thanks to allergies. When we didn't have an hour to wait for them to remake and deliver a replacement they said they'd put a credit for a free pizza under my phone number. We called tonight to redeem that and guess what isn't there. They stole our money and lied to us, offering only the same deal that is available to the entire public. Skip this location there are tons of other pizza places nearby."}
{"text":"My daughter Loves this pizza she said her favorite part is the sauce. The staff always offers discounts and coupons."}
{"text":"Is there a difference between Pizza Hut & Papa John's?  Lucinda & I were going to grab a pie from Pizza Hut on Sahara & Ft. Apache, but the store was CLOSED!  It was nearly 11 a.m.  The shop supposedly opens at 10:30.  A guy was in there.  Maybe his watch stopped.  We stopped by this Papa John's, located in a dingy disgusting strip mall. The young woman who served us acted bored & listless.  I've had Papa John's before.  Our pie was \"The Meats.\"  It should have been better.  In a move to boost profits they have evidently reduced meat portions and downgraded the quality of meat & cheese.  The crust was kinda spongy.  It was not a horrible pizza, just not very good.  I wonder if this shop has changed ownership.  This marks the 2nd major fast food disappointment in as many weeks.  Last week it was In N Out.  If I don't give up on fast food altogether I'll try Pizza Hut next time."}
{"text":"Ordered delivery, got here only 15 minutes later and was great and totally fresh. The delivery guy whose name I didn't get was also great and made it a positive short experience instead of a very lifeless handing over of boxes. Only negative is on my part as I forgot I used some of my cash earlier in the day - leaving me with only a few bucks to tip with when he definitely deserved at least a couple more than I was able to give him, sorry!  Definitely will be getting delivery from this location again."}
{"text":"Great pizza at a decent price; we've never been disappointed in their food or service! We ordered late evening during a slight rush and still had food delivered in under 30 minutes. Very impressed with presentation and toppings were well distributed and  fairly proportioned. Will be ordering again :)"}
{"text":"Sucks to get two Small Pizzas when you ordered 2 Mediums. And to add fuel to the fire, it was overloaded with sauce barely drizzled with cheese. I will drive farther out next time. This location isn't worth it."}
{"text":"I like Papa John's Pizza so it is easy to give them 3 stars. But I would consider this a strong 2, weak 3.  The large pizzas seem like they have gotten smaller. But the choice of specialty pizzas they offer more up for it. If you can catch a special deal like I did - Any large pizza for $11.00 with up to 5 toppings or any specialty pizza - it can almost make up for the lack of size. Almost.  I had originally called to place my order for delivery for 16 pizzas but when they told me it would be an hour and half, I said forget it. I will pick it up. They told  me they would be ready in 45 minutes to 1 hour. I was there in probably 40 minutes and they were all ready, waiting for me.   My only gripe is I tipped them $10. I know this is not much on a $190 order but I was picking it up and they didn't have to do anything but their job. So when I asked for some extra paper plates, bags, and condiments - to me it should not have been a big deal. And then if their customer service was up to par, one of the associates should have asked me if I needed help carrying out 16 pizzas to my vehicle. But nope, not one soul did. They just watched me come in and out, over and over again.   So, if I wasn't a big fan of the quality of the pizza, yes this would be a two star review. They need better management in this place to enforce better customer service."}
{"text":"Ordered online, email confirmation said 31-41 minutes, delivery arrived just shy of 30 minutes later. AWESOME! We ordered their special Bacon Cheeseburger pizza & Double Chocolate Brownie. Really good!  I was concerned about ordering from this location based on the Yelp reviews, but I'm glad to have a good experience to pass along."}
{"text":"I called to place an order over the phone and picked up in store... I had no problems at all! I was a tad bit nervous because all the recent reviews were negative but the pizza was delicious, it was ready upon arrival, and the service from friendly and adequate."}
{"text":"I wish I could give this place negative stars. I ordered pizza on a Saturday afternoon, and it was over half hour late. Manager Kristen made excuses, told me I had an attitude and hung up on me. When I called back for her manager, she gave me a fake phone number. Unacceptable"}
{"text":"I didn't feel like cooking dinner today, so I stopped by Pappa Johns to pick up a pizza. I walked in the door and noted a sanitation rating of A(93.5). The establishment was clean and bright. I was greeted by 2 friendly guys upon my arrival. I did not know what I wanted, so Cody suggested the Two Large Special with 2 toppings for $20 or the Two Medium Special with 1 topping for $14. I ordered the medium pizzas. One with pepperoni and the other with  polish sausage. After taking my order, Cody went straight to the sink and washed his hands! ( I was so geeked) I've had to ask employees to wash their hands before, which I didn't mind because you are not going to prepare my food with those stripper dollars, debit/credit cards hands. It took approximately 15 mins and I was on my way home. The Pizzas were cooked to perfection! I love the garlic butter and hot peppers. I will be back, but not for awhile, because I start the green smoothie cleanse tomorrow."}
{"text":"Now Open Under New Ownership! Call or Order Online for Carry-Out & Delivery! Open Late! Serving Carefree, Cave Creek and N Phoenix & Scottsdale communities!"}
{"text":"So, this is my first time ordering from this location. After repeating my order 3 times with the worker it still came wrong. I ordered a Small original crust buffalo chicken, that came right... Then I ordered John's Favorite in a thin crust, ended up coming as an original crust... Also ordered 3 sides of ranch, only 1 ranch came along with 2 garlic sauces. Only plus was the delivery was super fast, but at the cost of my order being delivered incorrectly..."}
{"text":"I've ordered from this location for a couple years now, they never disappoint. The one time they made a mistake, they went out of their way to fix it for me! Drivers are quick and polite!"}
{"text":"Veggie Mediterranean Lite pizza. Too much cheese, not enough salt, low taste quality."}
{"text":"Normally I love there food however I tried the new Spicy Chicken Pizza this thing is disgusting my stomach is turning. The sauce is a mae ploy sauce witch I love but not on a pizza makes the pizza sweet, the cheese is ok, The raw onions is hard to eat on it, if they where sauted or caramelized it might be better there was little chicken. This was one of the worse pizza's I have had threw the store I had about 2 slices with this one thats it . Its maddening cause I wanted to like it with all promotion going into this pizza. However thankfully I got breadsticks to eat for dinner :(   DISCONTINUE THIS PIZZA"}
{"text":"Great location. This location is where we always order our papa johns from. Other locations may have more dessert options, but this has always been a friendly and high quality location."}
{"text":"Usually enjoy Pappa Johns. Unfortunately this is the closest location to my home. Last three orders took over an hour each. Pizzas were always cold and sometimes burnt. Couldn't beleive they could be so bad so we gave them 3 chances. We order from Dominos now. No problems."}
{"text":"I only go here because it is so close to home , I get great deals in my email box and most importantly my daughter likes them  I prefer Pizza Hut shhhhhh lol."}
{"text":"Normally we love Papa John's, but they don't deliver to our place.  We really wanted pizza so ordered carryout from what we thought was the Middleton store.  Our mistake we ordered from here.  That's ok.  It was our mistake.  However, this store is insanely hard to find and get to and there is zero parking outside for carryout.  We ordered online from another store and the order stated it would be ready in 45 minutes.  It gave us a time.  It actually took longer than 45 minutes to weave through the square and finally park illegally in an alley behind the store while the husband went to get said pizzas.  They were just putting them in the oven.  So we had to wait another twenty minutes and staff wasn't apologetic, just rude stating that the pick up time is an estimate.  The pizza was fine.  It was fresh and stayed warm on an eighty degree day until we were home to eat it.  But....it's not worth the trip and while I gave no real issues with it taking an hour plus to be ready for carryout during a busy time of day  that should be acknowledged ahead of time."}
{"text":"After my last review I was contact by the new owner who said they were working on improving their customer service and asked to give them another chance. I can appreciate wanting to improve things, so I did. I can now report that they were able to make the pizza correctly and get it to me while it was still HOT! Nice work on turning things around."}
{"text":"Michelle, one of the managers, at this location is extremely unfriendly, full of attitude, and very unwilling to go out of her way to help her customers.  Michelle definitely makes this location look bad!"}
{"text":"We ordered delivery and it took less than hour to get delivered. Pretty typical with other pizza places. However, our pizza and bread was cold. We had to heat it up in the oven. Our delivery driver was nice."}
{"text":"Never had such a poor experience. Took nearly 2 hours for a delivery order. After being quoted 35-45 minutes called in an hour later to find out the pizza was ready and should be on its way. Called back 30 minutes later to find out there was an entry error and it was never sent out. Due to the pizza inedible from being so cold the manager had to have the pizza remade. Now almost two hours later hoping our pizza will arrive soon....   Can't say we will be ordering from Papa John's again."}
{"text":"Things I like about this papa john's:  1) Online ordering 2) Drivers that always find my impossible to find house without having to call me.  It's the only pizza place I order from because its the only one I've found so far that has both 1 and 2.  There was something off about the bbq sauce in my bbq chicken pizza last night though... not enough water mixed in with the bbq sauce concentrate?  Bbq sauce being prepared by pizza maker who was smoking?  Not sure, but I think I'm going to stick to red sauce for a while."}
{"text":"Hi all, just tried order pizza from here and it was quite the experience. I actually spoke with the manager Shawn who took my order. After repeating my credit card info 3 times she told me my card was invalid. Then I repeated it for the fourth time and had her read it back to me and it was processed correctly. I checked on my credit card statement after the phone call and was charged 3 times for this transaction... now I have to dispute the charges with my bank.  I concluded the conversation with a \"thank you\" and she hung up immediately. I felt really concerned that my interaction would cause my order to be confused based on the experience I had while trying to pay for my food. I called up and explained my concern and Shawn was quick to say \"no problem we will cancel your order and you can contest the charge on your card\".   Terrible customer service. No matter how much this franchise advertises with customer service like this they are going to go down fast.  The employees clearly don't care about the people who order from here. They just want there paycheck and could care less what you say or do because the money does not come out of there pocket."}
{"text":"Bad customer service. Terrible communication and my order has gotten messed up three time in a row!!!! Save your time and money by not ordering from here. Their \"management\" has a terrible attitude so I will never order here again."}
{"text":"Horrible customer service. It took 15min just to be able to pick up my order. Never again will I order papa johns."}
{"text":"Ordered for 4:30 delivery on a Wednesday an hour in advance, showed up at 4:45. Was there a mad rush? Doubtful. Have only ordered twice from this location but there doesn't seem to be consistency and the delivery charge bothers me as they also expect me to tip the driver.  What is the location doing for the $3.50? Not much, the driver is doing all the work.  Going to have to pass on this place and go back to my old favorites. Also, they gave me one tiny pepperoncini for a large pizza, why bother??!!."}
{"text":"Inefficient and lazy.  It's one thing to not deliver on time but it's another thing to not deliver at all.  This place is awful don't trust them."}
{"text":"Pizza arrived an hour after I ordered. I was told it would arrive 30 minutes or sooner.  Wasn't hot at all. My first time ordering from this location and probably my last. Very disappointed"}
