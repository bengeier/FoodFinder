{"text":"Wonderful little cafe! Found it on Yelp, was not disappointed. I've had Cuban sandwiches all over the country, this one was the best. Great, friendly service, good prices, great value! Do yourself a favor, SAVE ROOM FOR DESSERT! All delicious."}
{"text":"OH HAPPY DAY!   The new Betty's Rooste has opened!  Same great food and DESSERTS!  Liz is there along with her friendly staff.  Come in and see for yourself.
Now there are two Betty's to choose from."}
{"text":"This place is far better than you can imagine. 
You will enjoy every bite. Best food in Sun City."}
{"text":"We went for breakfast. Normal breakfast fare at reasonable prices. Service was good, and food came hot and fresh. Will probably give lunch a try at some point."}
{"text":"Very good spot for a sandwich. I wouldn't come here with a large group as seating is limited. My mom and I both had a sandwich and chips also with a drink. Tip and bill total under $20. I will definitely return if I'm in the area."}
{"text":"We found this place on Yelp since I was meeting some folks right in the building were Betty's is located.  Despite the great reviews, we didn't know what to expect.  It looks like a luncheonette in the first floor lobby of a medical office building.  Not an auspicious first impression.  Our opinion changed as soon as we walked in the front!  Everybody was super friendly.  The owner waited on us and made some suggestions as to what we should order.  I had a breakfast platter and my wife had one of the daily specials.  Everything, including the baked goods, are made fresh.  They source the bread for their toast from a special local bakery.  These are just little touches you don't expect in such a modest location.  When we asked for the check, I had to look twice to make sure everything was included, it was that inexpensive for what we got.

Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"I wish I had taken photos of my food before I ate it!  I had the Reuben & an extra side of pasta salad. Both were amazing.  The deserts are fresh baked. I couldn't decide between the 5 choices...  the pies looked amazing.  The service was quick and friendly. I thought the prices for a good lunch were low.  I am stuffed and I will be back again!!"}
{"text":"Food is in the mediocre to good range, nothing crazy special. They have a nice variety. It gets the 4 star bump for dessert. You know what is badder than a bangle tiger? The peanut butter tiger cookie from here!"}
{"text":"The best secret for breakfast or lunch in Sun City Az. Check out the pictures, now multiple the flavor of the food 10 times. Fantastic place to eat. Also Betty and staff are so nice!"}
{"text":"Great little restaurant near the hospital. Seems to cater to the elderly, which makes sense due to its location in Sun City. Limited menus but good selection is salads, sandwiches; both cold and hot. Nice proportions and great service."}
{"text":"Came to Betty's Rooste because of the good reviews.  If you are a regular or a senior....this is the place for you.  I, on the other hand, am not and had a less than good experience.  Service was not good and food was ok.  I was overlooked more than once."}
{"text":"Mom and i went here tuesday morning.  Since we had never been there, we ordered a small breakfast.  The french toast was the best i ever had.  The bacon was cooked perfectly.
The staff is fantastic and the place is super clean.
We will definitely be going back.  The prices were really good too.  Low prices for fixed incomes is fantastic.
I cant wait to eat there again, and i will."}
{"text":"PRO: The food is GREAT! Salsa was the only thing that was gross out of the food. The server was the owner and she was really nice and made some great suggestions when it came to the food. CONS: No high chairs when we asked for one she said they only ever have older people come in (we are in our late 20s early 30s) so that was a little off putting, also I ordered a tea and my husband ordered a lemonade I am picky when it comes to my tea and was not a fan of the tea so I asked for a lemonade in stead yet she charged me for 3 drinks when technically we only had two drink orders. Because of this we will probably never come back. :/ which is a shame because the food was good, but I'm not about getting nickeled and dimmed."}
{"text":"Cute decor in this bright attractive little restaurant. It is located at the front of a medical building facing Thunderbird Avenue and directly across the street from a bowling alley This restaurant is a great find! Quality food in a convenient location. 

Friendly service here, they actually remember their customers. I liked my breakfast of bacon, eggs, home fries plus great coffee! For lunch I drop by for my favorite sandwich, the BLT, that uses great applewood cured bacon. Daily specials encourage trying new dishes. Like the chili with delicious cornbread.

Lemon cheesecake is definitely a winner! Just the right consistency with fresh lemon flavor. Can't wait until the owner/chef prepares it again!"}
{"text":"Thanks. We enjoyed everything a Great place to eat. Steak and blue salad the bomb , the Cuban sandwich delicious, the shrimp salad great. Clam chowder we love. Italian cake mmm good. We ll be back . Chow XO Petunia"}
{"text":"The first time I came here I had a cup of New England clam chowder. The soup was the best clam chowder I've ever had. Creamy,savory,clammy,hot. This soup was neither bland or grainy. So go on Friday. I like this little place. Very clean and neat. And everybody is very friendly, smiling and seem to enjoy their jobs. The second time I had a California chicken club. That was tasty. The French fries are the wedge kind and beware they are served piping hot. So don't burn your tongue. Thanks Betty, see you on Friday!"}
{"text":"The food here is really really good! I had the Cuban sandwich with the fries. The pork shoulder in the sandwich was melting in my mouth with every bite. The bread was toasted perfectly and had great crunch to it. The fries there have this amazing seasoning and are very flavorful. For dessert, I ended up with the strawberry bar and it was really tasty. Great texture, and just the right amount of sweet. Highly recommend this place!"}
{"text":"My wife and I ate breakfast at this restaurant located in the front of a medical building. It was quite busy and we looked at the menu prices and decided to give it a try. We weren't disappointed. My wife ordered a dish with carnitas and eggs and loved it while I ordered Betty's special scramble with ham, spinach and other delights. Delicious!  The fact portions are on the small side which is ok with me and we received our meals only 5 minutes after ordering even though the restaurant was packed. Very reasonable pricing. We will be back to try lunch."}
