{"text":"This cafe is only good for Instagram pictures. The server staff is rude. My friend asked about a component of the dish and was greeted with a scoff.  I also dislike waiting 30 min after being seated just for someone to offer water for the table. And no, it was not busy. There were several servers free. The food is mediocre at best. This is place acting like a top end resturant but with nothing to show for. I am so disappointed and would not recommend.  Lastly, yes it is pretty, but a metal kettle for tea is not a great idea. Also if you're okay with your honey mixed with water... well yeah."}
{"text":"Beautiful cafe and store, over all it's a big wow factor. However I felt the staff was not very friendly, still a lot of work to do in order to get things running smoothly. Not sure if the staff have been professionally trained. The hostess(es) weren't very friendly, I have been working in the hospitality industry for over 15 years, and this place needs a lot of work and proper hospitality staff.   The food on the other hand was so so, my husband and I tried the lobster roll, I ordered mine with a salad on the side and my husband had fries. The salad was very french and light, which was nice. The sandwich itself, you can taste that the lobster was frozen and wilted, lots of water coming out of it, so whatever flavor the chef/cook used, you couldn't taste it.  I might go back to try something else, but until this place has properly trained staff and running smoothly, I feel it would be a disappointment if I went anytime soon again."}
{"text":"Come here on a Sunday morning with another couple and our kids.  The hostess staff aren't very organized. They don't take names at open, so everyone just stands around. When it gets close to opening, then the hostess staff ask you to form two lines - one to get into the store and one for food. Why not just line up from when people start showing up and the hostess is there anyway.  When the lines started forming everyone just rushes and obviously people don't get in line according to who was first.  Anyway, we waited our turn cause many couples budded us. When it was our turn the hostess told us there would be a 10 min wait to be seated and asked for our phone number (this is when only about 4-5 tables were seated) I asked the hostess why we had to wait when there were tons of staff and lots of tables available. The hostess told me they didn't want to overload the kitchen with orders. I asked the server if we could just sit down because we have two young children and it would be great just to sit - but the hostess said no. I even said we wouldn't order until they were ready and she still said no. So I got pissed off and asked for a manager. Another more senior hostess come over and asked what the problem is. I said I simply just want to sit - there doesn't seem to be a shortage of staff or tables. We won't order anything . Finally this hostess said it's not a problem.  Amy was our server and she was great, but the hostess staff need to learn to run a restaurant. Who asks people to wait when you have staff to wait on tables and tons of tables.  Worst service ever"}
{"text":"One of my fave spots because of the upscale, extraordinary, classy atmosphere. Very polite staff and great food. I'm so happy when I come here, it's an experience. I had the chicken and my friend had the burger; and both were just really great dishes. I recommend trying their hot chocolate in the winter times. It's a great spot for couples to go to. I will be returning as much as I can :3"}
{"text":"The RH cafe is truly awesome! From the ambience to the food. I had the grilled cheese,  truffle fries, sprinkle wine. yum yum!  if it's your bday or just meeting a girlfriend this is the place to come for brunch/lunch, or even dinner."}
{"text":"Brave the chaotic parking, show your infinite patience and you too may dine at the cafe that is showering everyone's insta stories - Welcome to the RH cafe. I was curious to check out this place and surprised to find that on a Thursday afternoon I still had to wait 30 min. Once seated in a comfy couch we dined on scrambled eggs and the beef dip sandwich.  The food was above average, but a bit steep considering the price.  But hey, you're not there to get Michelin star food, you're there for the decor (which is excellent) and the social media attention.  Would I go again? Probably, if there wasn't a line (but what are the odds?).   My final HLIW (how long I'd wait) score: 20 min."}
{"text":"I met up with some Friends to have surprise a birthday.  I Ordered the truffle grilled cheese with the garlic fries in the aisle he was absolutely delicious. My friend ordered the simple fish well done and it was very well seasoned and perfectly cooked we also ordered a cappuccino that came out so beautifully presented. The service was very good, the ambiance was absolutely magnificent and Parisian."}
{"text":"What a beautiful cafe! My mother and I came here to enjoy lunch on a Tuesday afternoon. There was a half an hour wait, but they sent us a text when the table was ready. We were seated in these beautiful, tall grey chairs, in what felt like a European garden. The chandeliers and greenery were absolutely stunning, and I forgot I was in Yorkdale. I will say this place is on the pricier side, so not necessarily something that can be enjoyed on the regular, unless your wallet allows it! I had the Bellini, which was Prosecco with peach puree. It wasn't overly sweet, which I loved. We ordered the burrata to start, and this was creamy goodness. It was served with grape tomatoes with basil and olive oil, and sourdough toasts. It was so fresh, and the sweetness of the tomatoes complimented the cheese so well. This was very filling with the toasts, but so worth it. For our mains, I had the grilled cheese with fries, and my mom had a lobster roll. My grilled cheese was total perfection. The gooey cheese and yummy bread, plus the amazing hand cut fries with the garlic mayo hit the spot. I couldn't finish it all, but they kindly packed it to go. For our dessert, we got the homemade cookies and ice cream, which was just ok. I wasn't really wowed by this, and could have done without. We saw some beautiful donuts upon leaving, but wasn't offered to us. The bill came to over 100, before tip, which was rather steep. However, it was a great experience, and I'd return."}
{"text":"Yes it's beautiful and Instagrammable! We had to do some repairing of our iPhone which was being done for 4 hours so we had plenty of time to kill so we thought to spend some time in RH Cafe and as seen in various reviews that the waiting time is about 1 hour so obviously we had time for that \"waiting\" as well! But turns out we got our seats right away and I was not ready to have a coffee because I was felling warm by running here and there in the mall!!  Anyways we ordered a Latte and a vanilla ice cream(which was yum!) but the only issue is that if they could increase few items in the menu. We are vegetarians and there was very few items for vegetarians. The options which they have is not like I would love to eat.  If they could increase few items according to vegetarians or for non vegetarians then it would be the best place for weekend brunching!!  The atmosphere is lovely and of course everything is beautiful!!"}
{"text":"I really enjoyed my experience at the RH cafe. Though I did have to do some advance planning for Sunday brunch with friends. They open at 11am so we got there around 10:30 to put our names on the list. The reservation system is fairly typical of downtown Toronto restaurants where you have to put your name on the list in-person. I imagine this irks some people who aren't used to it but I wasn't upset about it.    While waiting for our table we got to hang out in the 'patio' area right in front of the entrance of the store. The cafe itself is visually stunning, feels like you're sitting in a Grecian courtyard (see pictures). My description honestly doesn't do it any justice.   We were seated at 11am as soon as they opened and service was impeccable from start to finish.  Servers were attentive, knowledgeable, our beverages were replenished before we could even ask. Honestly, couldn't ask for more.   Okay, now the food. They have a really simple menu and their breakfast options even more so limited. We all opted for the scrambled eggs with creme fraiche, served with avocado and two slices of Texas toast. Simple, underrated, delicious and filling. The eggs are prepared a tad runny so if that's not your style, you can ask them to cook it a bit more. The bread is the real star of the show - two slices of thick cut toast that just oozes with buttery goodness.  They also have freshly baked pastries so I ordered an almond croissant and the old-fashioned sour cream glazed donut. Both delicious!  The donut is quite sweet so it's perfect for sharing over a cup of coffee.   Price point wise, I'd say they're a little pricey - the scrambled eggs were $14 (I know!), but after eating it, it seemed to be less of an issue. Could have been all that butter going straight to my head (and arteries).   After our leisurely brunch we took the opportunity to go inside the store and walk around a little bit. They sell coffee and pastries inside the store as well which is nice.   I would definitely recommend this spot for a meal but don't walk in expecting a very big menu and be prepared to wait for a table."}
{"text":"My husband took me here for my birthday brunch. We arrived early (10:30 am) to the mall as we were told that they don't take any reservations. The cafe is at the extension end of Yorkdale so we had to walk a bit from the underground parking side. As we stepped closer to restaurant, we felt like we were at an exclusive destination! The size of this building amazed me. It was 4-storey high! The receptionist marked our phone number down and told us that the wait would be about 45 minutes. Thankfully though, we arrived early and could easily kill time off in the mall.  About 30 minutes later, we got a text message (yes, a text message!) from the Restoration Hardware telling us that our table was ready and that we had 5 minutes to claim it before they give it away. Despite their odd policy, the cafe was stunning! Huge, sparkly chandeliers hung throughout the ceiling. Riser chairs, comfy nooks, plushy cushions, marble tables and massive artificial grass walls. Restoration Hardware didn't hold back on their decor, which of course shouldn't be a surprise to anyone.  Now onto the food, which almost sounded like it was secondary at this cafe. The menu here was limited. If you're here for brunch classics like the eggs benny then I'm sorry you'll be disappointed. But they do offer pastries, scramble eggs, granola and toasts to start your mornings. Will and I ordered the Shaved Prime Rib French Dip and the Lobster Roll with a cup of coffee.  I wasn't sure which one I liked more between the two. They were both delicious! My lobster roll had generous amount of fresh, meaty lobsters stuffed between the soft white bun. The roll could be a handful to eat as the meat kept falling off. The Prime Rib French Dip was also tasty! Tender and juicy beef sandwiched with slices of melted Swiss cheese. We paired it with a side of crispy sweet potato fries. YUM!  Towards the end of the meal, our hostess surprised me with a freshly baked cookie topped with ice cream for my birthday! What a lovely way to end our dining experience."}
{"text":"This is def my new favorite cafe in toronto. From the ambiance (which was spectacular) to the food and all the fine details, it doesn't get classier than this. The feeling is as if you're in Paris or somewhere in Europe just enjoying a quick bite.   We ended up having chai lattes (actually really delicious) with the grilled cheese and fries - one of the best grilled cheese sandwiches I've ever had.   The decor was top notch with marble tables, gold accents and amazing lighting.  I'd recommend going here whenever you want to dress up and have a little date or even to celebrate something special.  The only downfall is that the menu isn't big, so if you're expecting a huge dish for a cheap price - u won't get that here.   Can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"If you are looking for a beautiful place to dine this is your spot!   Everything from the table setting to the beautiful decor is modern and classic at the same time.   You instantly feel like you are dining in SOHO New York or Paris.   It is simply romantic. My friend and I shared a truffle grilled cheese sandwich and an RH burger.   We both agreed that we had the best grilled cheese in the world here.  It was so buttery and cheesy and you could taste the truffle oil.    The burger was also very good.  We liked how sweet the bun was.   Overall the experience and service of the RH Cafe is great!  This would be a beautiful place for a date with your significant other.   We also saw a lot of girls nights happening!  They also had a great selection of wine and cocktails.   Thank you RH cafe!"}
{"text":"All stars go to the decor and atmosphere of this cafe! Makes you feel like your a princess! Would def come here at least once even if it's just for a cup of coffee for the ambience of this cafe. So high end & luxurious feel eating in this setting. Food wise of course is overpriced on the basis of the decor. Nothing special in regards to the food."}
{"text":"Came here for Saturday brunch. I gotta say - the decor and design was beautiful. It was so cute and chic. They didn't take reservations so we waited for about 45 minutes before getting a table. I ordered the truffle grilled cheese ($18) and it was probably the best grilled cheese I've ever had. It came with a colourful side salad which also tasted pretty good. I had a mimosa as well but unfortunately tasted more orange juice than champagne. Overall, cute vibe, would return if I happen to be in the mall and was feeling for brunch."}
{"text":"When you need to take a break from the heat of the prices in Restoration Hardware, step into their stunning courtyard cafe. The banana split was a steep $18 but it's basically a meal. The cold press coffee was delicious for $4. The grilled cheese was good too, as per my friend but I'll have to take his word since I ate the sundae as my meal since it was massive!"}
{"text":"Excellent Restaurant!  We have eaten at this restaurant 3 times and each time the food was delicious! It is a beautiful restaurant and you feel like you're eating outside. The servers are professional and the ambiance is outstanding! Give it a try because there aren't many other restaurants like RH Café Yorkdale. We have also eaten at the RH Café in West Palm Beach which is also excellent! Try it, you'll be glad you did!"}
{"text":"Spectacular ambiance. Today was a rainy, gloomy Monday. I didn't realize this was opened 4 days ago, I saw the chandelier from far and it just pulled me right to it as I thought it was a brand new high end hotel opening as the name \"RH\" it actually stands for \"Restoration Hardware\". I've ordered the on the board smoked salmon. The Texas toast were really good, but the smoked salmon were nothing to write home about.   The restaurant component is in partnership with celebrated restaurateur Brendan Sodikoff that offers a seasonal, ingredient-driven menu set within sheltered gardens with towering heritage olive trees, trickling fountains and glimmering chandeliers. In addition, a pantry will serve craft espresso, a curated selection of artisanal wines and craft beers, and fresh house-made doughnuts and pastries from Sodikoff's famed Doughnut Vault in Chicago.   They don't take reservations, but it's very relaxing ambiance, it feels like being back in Asia Or Miami. Excellent ambiance and a great place for first date!"}
{"text":"Came here for late lunch on Boxing Day. The wait time was two hours but you don't have to lineup outside the restaurant like Cheesecake Factory. They take your phone number and will message you when the table is ready, which is nice.   The place is very cozy. The food was surprisingly better than I expected. The portion was decent. The trout was seasoned perfectly. The prime rib sandwich was delicious. The tomatoes came with the burrata were sweet. Note that they char the bread, which I don't like. So next time if I go again I will ask them not to do so.  The service was excellent. The staff was friendly. Overall I enjoyed the meal and the experience very much."}
{"text":"Decided to come check out the furniture and see what he hype was about. Absolutely lovely courtyard design. Makes you feel like you're outdoors. The wait is long (1h-1h 30m) on a weekend but you can leave your number down and they'll text you when your table is ready.  The menu is very limited and expensive for what you're getting but it's Yorkdale so it's kind of expected. I got the eggs/toast/avocado and my friend got the granola. Both were amazing. The toast they use is thick toast and it's SO good. They also give you a strawberry jam to put on the toast which is made in house.  Service was ok. In the end, they forgot our drinks that we kept on asking for on three separate occasions so that was a 30 minute wait just for hot water. Other than that, no complaints and I'll definitely come back to try their burger and lobster roll!"}
{"text":"The menu is on the small side for drinks and food, hope they would expand on that.  The atmosphere is beautiful! They make it look like an outdoor patio, and those chandeliers are mesmerizing, and after you are full from food you can walk around the huge furniture store and Yorkdale mall, awesome location!!   Beautiful beautiful place!"}
{"text":"Came here on my birthday with my family/boyfriend/boyfriends family and all enjoyed ourselves. No complaints, server was nice and the food came out quickly. I got the burrata and it was very delicious !  The decor was absolutely beautiful and it felt like we were eating in a courtyard cafe somewhere in Manhattan. Only downside was the wait time but luckily for us we came early because we read the other reviews stating that it would be busy on weekends. We did not mind the wait too much because it was what we were expecting. The server also informed us that the weekends are the busiest and the wait is normally 1hr45 mins-2 hrs, and they don't take reservations.  The overall experience was spectacular and I would definitely be returning :)"}
{"text":"This place is BEAUTIFUL! And the restaurant is just perfect. I went for brunch on Saturday - there was a 1.5hr wait. I didn't mind because it's connected to the mall so you could shop in the mean time.   We ordered the RH scramble, RH granola, artisanal prosciutto and a side of bacon. We also had mimosas to drink with chai lattes and cappuccinos with freshly baked cookies on the side. It was all so delicious and the restaurant was so pretty.   I definitely recommend this place, especially if you're going to Yorkdale to shop!"}
{"text":"Food quality i would give 3.5/5, my friend and I ordered a burger with fries and prime rib sandwich with salad respectively.  The burger and prime sandwich  were good and we very enjoy it  however the fries is too salty and dry like potato chip.  Decoration gave me a wow factor therefore I rate environment as 3/5 the main reason I minus two point due to while we were eating there was gentleman was doing video taping the dinning room this make me feel uncomfortable and distracted also that's one the reason I rate service as 1/5. The service is very unprofessional. Food was take more 30 min and the coffee and tea more than a hour to arrive because the server forgot to place the order.  While we were waiting the food and drink the server is not even check it out for us not even bring us any water instead looking at the tablet until 15 min I need to ask another server to bring us water. After we finish our food the drink still not yet arrive I ask the server where is our coffee and tea. The server finally figure out she didnt place the order and try blame someone else by asking us did we order from other server.   Overall I am very upset the quality of the service. It is very ridiculous and unprofessional. Good food, good decoration but extremely unprofessional service. I am strongly recommend go somewhere else even a food court can provide way better service"}
{"text":"Beautiful setting! The nicest place I've been to so far in Toronto. It only gets 4 stars because the menu doesn't really have a lot of options. But settings are more important to me than the food, but that's just me."}
{"text":"Finally got to try this Cafe inside one of the latest additions in Yorkdale, Restoration Hardware.  Restoration Hardware is a furniture store from Chicago and they target high-end audiences.  What really impressed me is how nice the decor is in this place, they really made sure the furniture used in this Cafe matches what they are selling.  Yes the decor looks very upscale and the prices on their menu aren't high at all.  Only complain I have is the limited choices on their menu.  My friend and I ordered the RH Burger and Shaved Prime Rib Dip, both looked gorgeous and my guest and I really enjoyed taking pictures of them!  Taste waste, both the Burger and Sandwich were decent, but they were on the saltier side.  If you get the Prime Rib Dip, you can skip pouring the sauce on the side as it's flavourful enough already.  Both meals also come with a side salad or fries and we both got fries and they were paired with Ketchup and Garlic Aioli Mayo.  The Mayo was DELICIOUS and I really enjoy dipping my fries into that!  Overall, I would say this place is great to bring a date, food could be better to match the upscale decor, but for the prices you pay, I would say food is good already.  I will come back for sure another time to try other dishes!!"}
{"text":"Nice decor, tasty food, very good coffee and cappuccino. Service was a bit slow and we had to wait even though the cafe area was empty. Nonetheless, worth a try!"}
{"text":"loved the decor and ambiance for sure, everything is very esthetically pleasing and you thoroughly enjoy sitting/dining here. i came here for a quick snack on a busy Saturday - love that we're able. to out our names down and returned when they text you! we explored RH and before we knew it, they were ready to seat us. it was probably 10 minutes after their first text before we returned to the hostess stand.  since this was just a snack and more so a rest for us, we didn't try much. my mom had a croissant, they were out of the almond .. so she got some regular butter crossaint. it was good nothing extraordinary, baked fresh that day. my sister and i shared the prime rib French dip sandwich $24, served with au jus and fries with garlic aoli. we were glad we shared it, as it was a decent portion! it was good, but i felt the cheese was too overpowering, not very complimenting. the fries were great.   i would come back, probably for a coffee and for the atmosphere, but i don't think it's worth the price, you're paying for the aesthetic more so than the food, in my opinion. if cheesecake didn't have such an outrageous line, we would've gone there."}
{"text":"This is a furniture shop where you can eat and drink (other than Ikea)! The courtyard cafe is set in a beautiful outdoor like space with chandeliers and greenery. There are even fake windows and balconies to make it feel like a real courtyard! The design is super cute and a reservation is recommended.  The menu isn't very expansive. They have the basics such as sandwiches, salads and a few main dishes. I tried their rainbow trout with lemon butter. It was very simply made, but quite delicious. Price wise, I would say I was paying more for the environment rather than the food itself. But it was a worthy splurge after a day of shopping in Yorkdale!"}
{"text":"From the ambiance to the service and food quality, this place deserves my 5 stars! Coffee was good, the brunch options even better. My boyfriend ordered the beef dip sandwich and kept saying how good it was. I loved the scrambled eggs with truffle, it was creamy and paired well with the texas toast. The avocado with lemon and olive oil adds an interesting touch of freshness. I would definitely be back"}
{"text":"I'll admit it. When I heard that the Restoration Hardware in Yorkdale had a restaurant, my expectations of it were set pretty high. I based this level of judgement on how I've come to associate the store itself: a level of quality, customer service, and user experience that surpasses anything else I've seen like it or remotely like it. So I visited the restaurant one afternoon with a friend. I decided to put my expectations to the test. And to say the very least, my prior judgements were correct: the restaurant was absolutely delightful. From the moment we approached the host, we were instantly treated like family. The inside decor was even more stunning from the outside. We knew we were in for a treat. The only thing better than the service we received and the ambiance of the atmosphere we were immersed in was the food. I ordered the hamburger and my friend opted for the shaved prime rib dip. Both are delicious, savoury, and highly recommended. If you haven't visited the restaurant yet, I suggest you do because no trip to Restoration Hardware is complete without it!"}
{"text":"Let me be clear first, this  review is bese on their menu, I believed the menu selection was very poor. I ordered the RH Burger, they didn't ask me how I wanted the meet to be cook and and up been a bit to over cook and dry for my taste. This place is like a driving a Lamborghini with a Honda Civic engine, their Decor is extremely beautiful for what they offer. Amazing place if you are looking to have a nice and quite conversation in the middle of the chaotic Mall."}
{"text":"Salad is okay and I like the sofa it's so comfortable!!!  But it need to wait for half an hour at least!!"}
{"text":"My fiancé and I checked this spot out after seeing the numerous posts on social media. When we arrived, the host informed us that they were just cleaning some tables and we would be seated shortly. 10 mins or so passed and we were still waiting on the couches so my fiancé asked the host and he had completely forgotten. Not off to a great start considering we were the only ones waiting on the couch.   We decided to go for an afternoon pick me up, so we shared an order of truffle grilled cheese and opted for their tea service - I had peppermint leaves and she had the jasmine silver tip. The truffle grilled cheese was good and the fries that it came with were crispy but for $19, not worth it. The tea was very good and it came with small individual sealed jars of honey but at $6.50 each also very pricey.   The cafe itself is gorgeous and you're definitely paying for the ambiance and the social media pictures. Overall, it's nice to visit once but I don't know if I'll be back."}
{"text":"Wait was 1.5 hours to get table, then another 30 minutes for food to arrive.  Food was alright as one can't go wrong with hamburgers.  Atmosphere was amazing.  Price is high for the quality of the food but it's the atmosphere that you are paying for.  It's a one-time experience to say \"Yes, we've been there!\" and nothing more."}
{"text":"I've been meaning to go since it opened, but only now found the time. It's located inside the Restoration Hardware store and immediately upon entering I felt transported to cafes/restaurants in Europe. Like if I was blind-folded going in, I wouldn't have known I came through the mall.  The selection of food enough to cater to most everyone. My friend chose the truffle grilled cheese and the RH scramble (eggs and toast) and I decided on the lobster roll.   Truffle grilled cheese - simple, but elevated RH scramble - fluffy Lobster roll - small portion, but each chunk of lobster was juicy   Overall the service was good. Food was delicious!"}
{"text":"Decor is nice. But that's about it. Food was below average. Most of the things that came out on our board was so hard, it was not even edible. The grapes were mushy asf. Came here because it was so pretty but this was our first and last visit."}
{"text":"The interior decor was DIVINE! That alone was the reason I wanted to come here. To my surprise the green tea latte with oat milk instead of cow milk was also great. You could really taste the strong matcha flavour. The salads were also great. It is a bit over priced but the portions are large. The staff was quickly, professional and friendly.  I was seated in 10 minutes (I went on a Friday afternoon) despite being afraid I'd have to wait hours. Highly recommend and will be trying the grilled cheese next."}
{"text":"Gorgeous interior and sophisticated vibes!! Everything about RH cafe is perfect.   We came here pretty early, probably within an hour of the opening time on a weekend. We were seated at a huge table with soft comfy sofas.   The food didnt take long to come and the portion was surprisingly big! We could barely finish both dishes. The smoked salmon was delicious and the eggs were so yummy!! Our server refilled our coffee and water frequently, never leaving us with no caffeine in the cup.   It was definitely an experience to brunch at a sophisticated, nicely decorated open area concept restaurant."}
{"text":"Came back again for their grilled cheese but this time had the lobster add-on. It was delicious but be aware that it's an extra $21 (more than the actual grilled cheese). Also upgraded the side to the Kale Salad for an extra $4 which was worth it! The portion was actually quite large and the flavours of the ingredients complemented each other.   We came for dinner on a weekday and was seated righ away. Our server Eden that night was great! She was funny and quite attentive to us (followed up on one of our orders when she saw us waiting, even without us prompting her). Overall, another great dining experience here!"}
{"text":"Excellent atmosphere if you're looking for a place to have some drinks and chat. My fiance and I were seated after an hour wait, once we were seated we were not greeted or approached by a server for roughly 15 minutes. After patiently waiting understanding that it's Saturday night and it was busy I eventually let the host know we were still waiting to order. The manager approached us promptly, he was very professional, apologized and offered drinks on the house. Although it was not necessary at all - it was a very nice gesture. Excellent but limited wine list, local beers from Toronto were a nice touch. We had the smoked salmon board, in my opinion - toast was too thick to pair with fresh smoked salmon. The salmon itself was nice - it was served with capers, onions and fresh parsley. Would have enjoyed it more if it was served with thin sliced baked baguette. Overall the experience was great, menu needs a little work. Perhaps options like, foie gras, oysters, caprese salads, fig salads, and to finish a fruit plate would have been appreciated and suited the atmosphere more. Definitely will be back, but only for the atmosphere and the beautiful decor. The manager's customer service skills were recognized and appreciated."}
{"text":"This cafe is absolutely GORGEOUS and MESMERIZING with crystal chandeliers, dim lights, and white marble tables. Yes, it is a bit pretentious but once in a while, it is nice to be pretentious for a day lol. Most people know that RH stands for Restoration Hardware but little do people know that there is an actual cafe on the main floor at this 4 stories Yorkdale location.  Foodie tip #1: Do not come 45 minutes before the cafe closes, they will not serve you. They follow the same hours as the mall.  Foodie tip #2: There are no reservations but if you put down your name and number with the hostess, they will text you when your table is ready; hence, you see the \"Reserved\" table sign.  Foodie tip #3: Beware of bread overload LOL. I order 5 items to share and they all came in some form of bread #mindblown (Ex. Cheese platter, Smoked salmon platter, Truffled grilled cheese, Lobster roll, and even Burrata... holy, just look at that stack in my photo!). But nonetheless, they are all tasty but you have been warned lol.  Foodie tip #4: Go for the Delice de Bourgogne Cheese Platter if you love cheese! That cheese melts like a spread on the warm baguette. When you add the strawberry preserves, and candied pecans, it takes you to a whole new level ;)"}
{"text":"Great service! We were a party of 4, with 4 kids (stroller ages), but still they were able to accommodate us! The hostess was very nice, she even offered to take a picture of all of us together. Our waitress was nice as well! The next table over also had two babies so this cafe is very accommodating for kids! The high chairs were very lux, leather and comfy! If anybody cares there was a seat belt but only a 2 point harness.   However still a 30-40 min wait for a table for a weekday lunch! There's a nice waiting area with couches \"like a courtyard\" at least.   Didn't order much since we all had kids and their eating always comes first! Truffle grilled cheese ($19) and lobster roll ($31). Their iced tea ($3) was nice, unsweetened but I can taste the black tea flavour! Each main came with a side like a salad or fries. The fries were kind of dry and unseasoned. The salad was good, simple spring mix with a citrus vinegarette. The lobster roll was small but the entire \"bun\" was filled with chunks of lobster! So lots of lobster meat. It was okay. The lobster was over cooked. The grilled cheese was good for a grilled cheese. Thick bread, nice and crispy, buttery, ooey cheese inside, but where was the truffle? Maybe a hint of the smell, was it truffle oil? Kind of disappointing, especially since a grilled cheese should never cost more than $12 in my opinion. The food came out in a timely fashion. Paying was super easy with their iPad.   Overall, a nice cafe. Don't expect much from the food but the decor is very nice! Plus the service was top notch. Not all restaurants would've been happy serving 4 moms and babies!"}
{"text":"Very very nice ambiance and good service. If you need a break from shopping this is a nice place for a drink. As a vegetarian I was not tempted by anything on the menu. I don't eat dairy and all the vegetarian options relied too heavily on cheese. Great selection of local beers.  My review is for the drinks and atmosphere only."}
{"text":"Let's be honest, everyone's here for the photo ops. The atmosphere of this cafe is incredible, but the food is just okay. I can't say I didn't expect this though...  Chopped vegetable salad - best dish we ordered, loved the candied pecans  RH burger - meh  Grilled chicken - cooked well but nothing special  Charcuterie - meh"}
{"text":"Beautiful decor. Ridiculous wait times.  You've heard and seen the courtyard photos with beautiful chandeliers all over the place. But you probably havent heard about the ridiculous wait times. Also, the cafe does not take reservations (at least not when this review was written).  RH is a high end furniture store based in Chicago, but they are also known for their courtyard cafes that are adorned with crystal chandeliers and glass ceilings with pops of greenery here and there, as if you were really having tea in a garden. Once you get to the door, you'll have to give them your name and # and they will text you when your table is ready. One of the employees said the average wait time is 2-3 hrs (weekend). Mine was about an hour and a half because we got there just before peak time. They do have a pretty nice furniture selection on the upper levels plus you got the mall, so an hour doesnt feel that bad. Anything above that though is just too much.  Onto their food. Their menu isnt huge so dont expect full on meals here. Youre really coming for the aesthetics (charge your phones/cameras) and their chairs. People do spend a bit of time here, especially when theyve been waiting for so long. It is a pretty nice and comfy place to sit and chat though. First off, their RH burger was actually pretty good. It was a good portion and the meat wasnt dry at all. Plus, the sauces gave extra flavour to it. Presentation was also nice and neat. The chicken and fish were also ok... but nothing to make me order it again. The grilled cheese is another good one so if youre a grilled cheese fan, do give it a try.  Prices arent as bad as one might expect. But, they are a bit on the higher side for some dishes.  I would return for the beautiful atmosphere.. but probably not on the weekend. The wait times just seriously makes me laugh."}
{"text":"3.5   You've seen it on Instagram, but have you ventured inside? Was at Yorkdale on a weekday evening and there was no wait for a table, so I decided to try out the RH Courtyard Cafe for dinner (they don't accept reservations as of a few weeks ago).  It is as pretty as it looks online - lovely fake trees, marble tables, ambient lighting - it's amazing. The servers are also quite helpful and friendly.   After being seated I looked at the menu....yikes this place was expensive. Still I wanted to see if it was worth all the hype.   I ordered a truffle grilled cheese which came with your choice of salad or fries. Decided on fries because why not. The meal was prepared quite fast which is a plus.   Ok - the grilled cheese was huge - very large portion - plus the fries - I was not able to finish my meal in its entirety. The flavours were nice, the truffle oil was a refined touch - I felt like maybe it was almost too heavy? My friend got a burger and said it was pretty good too.   I've heard the scrambled eggs are good - I'm willing to try that again next time. They also have cold pressed juices, pastries, coffees etc. everything is priced from $5 (lattes), to $25 (meals).   Would I go often? Probably not because it's too pricey. This is a once in a while type of thing. It does meet the hype expectations though so if you've been waiting to try it out then go for it!"}
{"text":"RH Scrambled eggs ($14) scrambled farm eggs served with half an avocado and toast. The toast was thick, and the bread itself was sweet which was tasty. The eggs were super runny, probably because it was made with a lot of cream and butter. Doesn't look like a lot, probably made with just 2 eggs but with the avocado and 4 slices of toast it was really filling.   Shaved Prime Rib french dip ($24) This was surprisingly really good! There was a lot of beef in this sandwich. The sandwich alone was flavorful enough, after dipping it gets quite salty but how french dips are supposed to be. Comes with a fresh spinach salad on the side.  Latte ($5) - the latte was really good!  Fabulous decor, it creates a really nice atmosphere. I was impressed by the number of chandeliers, there was probably 1 above every 2 tables. The cafe looks really classy! The food was good, more on the pricier end but guess that's Yorkdale pricing. Only thing I didn't like was we were seated at a small round table in front of the kitchen. They were busy and tables weren't available so it was fine, but it got a little annoying as servers kept walking back and forth our table on both sides. It's like sitting in the aisle."}
{"text":"Bad service, bad food. One star for interior design.   Ordered the burger, which looked good but taste/flavor was not there -- definitely not worth for $19.   Our server had an attitude, and was extremely unprofessional/had no sense of urgency. If the servers don't care for quality service then I can only imagine what management is like.   No hospitality. Unprofessional and unfriendly, the food wasn't even good to makeup for the bad service."}
{"text":"Everything here is absolutely gorgeous! I would hang out here all day if I could! It's tucked away inside of Yorkdale and also doubles as a furniture store. We walked in on a weekday afternoon and waited 30 minutes to be seated. During the wait, I ordered a matcha latte, and it was delicious! it was sweet but also had a very strong matcha flavor without the excessive bitterness. I would much rather come here to grab a latte the equivalent at Starbucks.  For a place that sells furniture, I expected the food to be only mediocre but boy was I wrong! The food was amazing and totally worth it! We ordered the slow roasted chicken, RH burger, and the lobster roll. I could never image a chicken breast melting in your mouth but melt it did! It was juicy all on its own without the sauce, but that sauce just puts it over the top! Lastly, whenever I now crave a burger, the RH burger is all I can think about. The double patties are cooked to perfection oozing with juices. It would be perfect if it was topped with bacon. I'm salivating just typing this review. Will definitely be coming back for that burger!"}
{"text":"My best friend and I came here to see what the hype is about. As we got closer to the restaurant, I was actually pretty surprised at how nice it look. It was in isolation from all the other stores with an open concept that allowed you to see all four floors of the building with the cafe at the very front. We got to Yorkdale at around 1 and because they don't take reservations they told us to come back in an hour. Since the cafe is in Yorkdale we decided to walk around until we got a text. After 30 minutes or so we received a text and made our way back to RH ready to dine. The seats were so spacious and not to mention they were actually super comfortable. I especially loved their marble tables. The entire cafe was just very aesthetically pleasing.   Their menu was limited so we ended up just ordering a kale salad with a salmon plate since we weren't that hungry anyways. The kale salad was actually a Caesar salad mixed with kale and it was delicious. The salmon salad came with toast cheese and other things you could eat along with it and it was filling. The two dishes we got were perfect for sharing and surprisingly filling.   Overall, good service and food. The price is on the costly side but the aesthetics of the cafe and the entire building itself is worth it. Don't forget to go in and take a look at their furnitures too, cause they got some pretty stuff (take the elevator because they have a little bench you can sit on LOL)"}
{"text":"So I have been seeing this place mostly on instagram and I had to come and check it out.  If you want really good Instagram photos then this is a great place to have them.  Aesthetics at this place are on point.  Other than that the food isn't worth it.  It's pretty overpriced and nothing special.  I mean i ordered veggies and dip and that alone was $15 and it's something you can make at home.  Plus I almost had a heart attack when I saw that their banana split was $18.  I cannot pull out that much money for a banana split it's insane.    Great place for pictures but food wise there is better for cheaper!"}
{"text":"Got the lobster roll with salad for $31. Not as good as I expect, strong butter taste. but I was actually surprised that the scrambled eggs with toast is pretty good. Would recommend that one! The environment is nice, prob would come back and try the burger and smoked salmon later!"}
{"text":"Decor is picturesque and ambience is lovely. Was seated quickly at 5pm on a Wednesday evening but this is supposedly very rare. I've heard people say that the wait is usually an hour. Food is a bit pricey but very good. Had the artisanal prosciutto board and the portion size was good.   Would probably not come back often bc of the prices but I would come back once in a blue moon to treat myself."}
{"text":"This was how it went.  Walked up to the hostess to give her my name and number. She said a text message will be sent to me once a table is ready for us. Received the text and informed the hostess. She told us to have a seat at the couch. While waiting, we saw couples after couples check in with their text and they were brought in immediately. 15 minutes later, I went up to the hostess and she rudely said, \"in the future, you need to inform us when you receive the text message.\" I said I already did, and have been waiting here for 15 minutes.  She clearly forgot about us and wasn't even apologetic about it.    Food was mediocre. Despite the decor, our experience was ruined by their unprofessionalism, poor hospitality and lack of organization."}
{"text":"Beautiful dining environment. Food was not spectacular and pricey to match the great decor. Not a place for regular meals but definitively instagram worthy for those who love it."}
{"text":"Located at Yorkdale Mall, the Restoration Hardware Courtyard Cafe is a beautifully decorated restaurant outside of Restoration Hardware. The interior of the cafe is filled with natural lighting, greenery, grand chandeliers, and beautiful marble tables. The place is truly a place worth Instagraming.   My friend and I decided to dine at RH Courtyard Cafe on a Saturday around 10am. The place was pretty quiet this early in the morning. We also noticed that the menu catered more towards lunch and dinner with only a few options for breakfasts and brunch. We both ordered the RH Scramble (farm eggs, creme fraiche, avocado, chives, and texas toast) and I also got an Americano. Coffee was good. The RH Scramble portion looked small to begin with but the eggs definitely were super fluffy and buttery. The toast and avocado also made the whole dish heavy. As a result, we both were pretty full after finishing the meal.  Service was super attentive and friendly. The waiters did not rush us and always refilled our waters.  Overall, good service and food. The price is on the costly side but the interior is beautiful and worth checking out if you are at Yorkdale."}
