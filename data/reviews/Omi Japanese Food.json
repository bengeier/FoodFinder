{"text":"I had a craving that turned into a stomach rumble and that grew into instant hunger. The only cure was Vietnamese.  I needed something I could go grab and bring back to the office and I remembered seeing Omi as I used the +15 one day and told myself I was going to try it.  Well I did and I am very happy about it! I got here at 11:40 and there was already a 8-9 person line but it went fast.   I ordered the special which was lemon grass chicken or pork on vermicelli/veggies with a spring roll. I choose chicken. Which I have to say was well spiced and every chunk of meat was tender and savory. The spring tasted like it was made fresh that day, I was impressed.   The special was just under $8 and I was pleased with how much was packed in - overall good value and great flavor! Lunch time Vietnamese cravings will be silenced by Omi again soon!"}
{"text":"There's a reason why this place has the longest line-up at lunch in the Suncor food court.  Actually, a few reasons.  Fast, efficient, tasty, friendly and cheap.  You can get ready-made food like teriyaki and fried meats with your rice and veggies, or get pho or vermicelli bowls made to order.  I asked for no rice and extra veggies with my teriyaki chicken and they generously filled my box to the brim - there must've been at least a pound of food in it! Taste wise, it was pretty good.  Not too salty and just enough seasoning, though the aftertaste of msg is lingering in my throat a bit.  One item combo was only $7.55 + tax which is pretty cheap! Staff are very friendly.  Happy to have them as a choice for Asian food!"}
{"text":"I have heard so much hype about this place on how good their satay beef noodle soup was. I decided to pay this place a visit today on my day off and boy was I ever disappointed. The soup was salty and the beef was way less then what I anticipated. I know they used MSG as it made me super thirsty after eating it. For $9 I would say I could find much better somewhere else. For people who enjoy super salty food with MSG this is the place for you. I think I will pass."}
{"text":"I've walked by Omi so many times and have never tried it.  Having a bad cold and only wanting noodle soup, I finally decided to try it.  The food wasn't terrible, but the service was lacking.  I pretty much had to scream my order - not fun when you can barely talk to begin with.  Otherwise the line moved quickly.  I might try it again, but to be honest there are other places I tend to go for soup or vermicelli."}
{"text":"This is my favourite food court noodle soup. Beef Pho - Spicy is the best! Not for the medium spice lovers as it usually packs a punch! There is Satay that you can get on the side that increases the intense spiciness. I am a sucker for a good spicy noodle soup. A food court gem, my friend had their chicken sub (only available before 11:30 and after 12:30) and said it was awesome. It's usually pretty busy but they are very efficient!"}
{"text":"My sister insists this place had really good food and I decided to give it a try.  There's always a decent line here whenever I walk by so I figured it must be good.  We got the satay beef noodle soup.  The soup was under $10.  The satay they have by the plastic utensils is very tasty so you should grab some after you get your soup.  I was very impressed.  The beef noodle soup was probably the best one I've gotten out of a food court. I will definitely be coming here again. I also can't wait to try the other food. I'm told the other vietnamese and chinese food is also delicious.  This place is a food court hidden gem."}
{"text":"This place is probably the most flavorful place in the Suncor building. Always a line up because of their good food and good portions.  Their daily specials aren't much of a special as its only 50 cents or so off of regular price."}
