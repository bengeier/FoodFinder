{"text":"A local hidden gem that's not so secret anymore. Originally a butcher shop that sold porchetta sandwiches with a couple of picnic tables outside. It morphed into a larger space which is half food/butcher shop and half sandwich shop. In addition to porchetta, they now have veal, meatball, steak and grilled veggie sandwiches for sale. Recently noted that they also have some salads and pastries to round out your meal.

I've had the porchetta sandwich but prefer the steak. Tasty, thinly sliced steak with toppings of your choice - cheese, caramelized onions, mushrooms, roasted peppers....  Just don't ask for horseradish! This place is very Italian. The line up can be a bit long during the regular lunch hours but I noticed that they have online ordering and a pick up counter. Something to try in future. Eating area is bright and cheerful. 

Last week, I stopped in after work to pick up 5lbs of porchetta, buns, roasted peppers (hot and sweet) and caramelized onions for an impromptu dinner for 10. I hit it out of the ballpark with this dinner. Everyone loved it and we had leftovers for lunch the next day. 

One of my all-time Vaughan favourites."}
{"text":"This gem is tucked away in an industrial area that no one would think that you will find a good sandwich.  This is the second time I'm here and I ordered a veal sandwich on a round pancetta, with mushroom and rapini for toppings.  The sandwich is certainly one of the best I have, the veal is tender and go very well with the pancetta.  Best part of the sandwich is the sauce in it, all the other California sandwich places their sauce is always overdo and quite watery. The sauce they use is a little chunkier and has a nicer texture, there is more substance on this aside compare to the others.

I was here last year and I had a pochetta sandwich.  I did not get it this time because it is a little dry, my friend had it today and he said the pochetta is excellent today, he was with me last time and had a pochetta sandwich, he also remember it was dry.

I already know my next order.  Pochetta sandwich with rapini.  I'm sure it will be wonderful.."}
{"text":"The steak sandwich was AMAZING!  Very hard to find a great steak sandwich for such a great price, around $7.00.  However, be prepared for a lineup, this place gets packed during the lunch hour.  Well worth the wait."}
{"text":"Tried the porchetta, steak, and veal. The porchetta and veal were okay, I've had better porchetta once in Toronto and better veal once as well. They're a close second. The steak though takes the prize, and is the real 4 stars. Worth trying first."}
{"text":"This place is more grocery store than cafe, but the sandwiches are delicious. I came for the porchetta sandwich, but I think maybe it would have been a better choice to get a whole porchetta for a party than just 1 sandwich. Just the one sandwich seemed not as fresh, and not as flavourful without a bunch of added toppings. I liked it, I didn't LOVE it."}
{"text":"Love the fact that you can do your meat groceries for the week and then end your shopping by having a fresh porchetta sandwich. Very simple menu - sandwiches , salad and drinks that's it that's all! 

If your looking for a quick meal fix and are on lunch in the Vaughan area this is great. Place gets rammed from 12 to 2. 

Go check it out!"}
{"text":"Best porchetta and steak sandwich around, and the best bang for your buck. Really nice local, you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Awesome steak sandwich made to order. Veal chicken parm all fantastic . 
Will certainly be back. 
They valid carry a wide range of frozen meats and full dinners for larger groups."}
{"text":"We called in our order on our way to this place. It still took a long time for us to get our order. They do appear to be crazy busy at lunch so come early and try to order online first. There's a special online order pick-up line. 

My steak sandwich with hot peppers was good, but not spectacular. First of all, they charge you fifty cents for every topping - even a tomato slice. That's ridiculous. Secondly, they cook they steak to well done. Well done steak is a waste of steak, in my opinion. Third, they don't trim the steak well so there's a lot of fat and gristle. This does make the sandwich a bit hard to eat because the hard gristle doesn't bite cleanly so you end up yanking large pieces of steak out of your sandwich when you try to take a bite.

Not sure I would come back here of my own initiative, but if my cohorts wanted to come here, I'd probably try the grilled chicken sandwich or something else."}
{"text":"Superb meat shop and panino bar. The best steak sandwich plus so much more. A must try!"}
{"text":"The veal sandwiches are just amazing! Great value, great service and great lunch! Quite amusing to see how many people line up during lunch time."}
{"text":"very authentic and fresh. 
Gets quite busy but worth the wait. Porchetta on a bun is the best here ."}
{"text":"A lot of reviews here so I'll keep it short and sweet.

1. Porchetta is fantastic, buy a chunk and bring it home for dinner.

2. Steak sandwich is better than the porchetta sandwich, it's sliced steak charbroiled just right with smokiness. Excellent.

3. Sandwich toppings are pricey. You'll want them all but will be forced to pick and choose unless you don't mind a top dollar sandwich.

4. Has a dining area. Perfect.

5. Frozen artisan cakes in the fridge are tastey!

6. It can get busy here so come a bit earlier than you think you need to."}
{"text":"Best steak sandwich!  The porchetta is also fantastic.  Wish prices were back to $5.50 like afew years back,  but whatever!"}
{"text":"The porchetta sandwich is huge (more than enough for 1 person), with plenty of meat. The sandwich itself is priced well, but the toppings do seem too expensive (50c each for each topping, including \"basic\" things like onions). 

Its quite tasty, although I have to say that I prefer Porchetta & Co in downtown (although that is quite a bit more pricey, especially when you factor in its smaller size). One of the big differences between the two is that this place doesn't include the skin, which is one of the best parts. 

I'll come here again though if I'm in the area. Maybe next time I'll just get a chunk of porchetta, instead of the sandwich."}
{"text":"I got a new job in the area a few months ago and have been looking for lunch options on the days that I don't bring my own food.

Vicentina's came as a recommendation from my wife who used to work in the same area and I have to say that it's a pretty good option.

They get very busy at lunch so I STRONGLY suggest that you order online before heading over to pick up your sandwich. They have a +$3.99 optoin for double meat and I have to say that the one time I chose this option, I was overwhelmed! That is saying a lot because I'm a big eater!

I've been slowly making my way through the menu of options and I have to say that the Porchetta has been the best so far. The veal is completely underwhelming and while the steak is good, the slices are large and chewy to a point that you are pulling two or three mouthfuls of meat with each bite and having to manage it on your plate afterward. Also, I ordered medium rare meat and got well-done meat, not even a hint of pink at all.

Still, very good sandwiches in general though so I would recommend it if you work in the area or even somehow find yourself here too."}
{"text":"Best grilled steak sandwich in the city. Thinly sliced meat seasoned perfectly with cheese and mushrooms on a soft bun. Just amazing!!!"}
{"text":"The porchetta is probably the best choice here, the steak sandwich is much better if you order it at cataldi. I take issue with the veal, which they call it a veal parmiggiano, how can you call it that if it doesn't come with cheese? I called them out on that, the lady got all sensitive and defensive, lol, wow, grow up. Much better veal you could get at California sandwiches, just calling a spade a spade."}
{"text":"Nice little butcher / grocery / sandwich joint.  They always have this beautiful porchetta on display and you can order one of different sizes which is great for parties.

I went to the sandwich corner and got a porchetta sandwich.  Fresh bun, tender pork and roasted veggies.  Yum.

The butcher section had limited meat on display, so you need to order from the guy and it's pretty pricey meat."}
{"text":"Best steak sandwich in Vaughan period.

Long wait though, but all good things require time.

Well worth the wait"}

    Good Porchetta Sandwiches

    Depending on which Cafeteria Lady is on-hand. It can be pretty unbeatable.
    That's if you happen to be served by staff that seasons the Meat well. {3.5'd}
    It's a hotspot Lunch joint for nearby working-class now, which speaks volumes.

    Beautiful space, cafeteria, butcher shop, grocer. Wish they had more Parking."}
{"text":"No lineups Sunday mid afternoon.  Got porchetta sandwich for $6.99 plus another 50 cents for grilled veggies.  Very big sandwich with lots of meat - big enough to share.

Like that you can also buy porchetta for home.  Got a very generous sample from the man at the front counter.

Nice assortment of pasta and sauces.  Only wish was they had a fresh selection of cheese instead of pre-packaged ones.

Nice place for a quick snack close to Vaughn Mills mall."}
{"text":"Best porchetta I ever ate, I'm from New York and usually drive to Philadelphia for some good porchetta this place is in my must have before you leave this earth."}
{"text":"Place was really nice but the veal sandwich was cold. I wanted a hot veal. What's a man got to do to get a hot sandwich? I would maybe try again if I wanted to buy some meat from their fresh meat section."}
{"text":"This is a meat lovers paradise!

Try the steak sandwich, if you love beef, you will not be sorry. The bae got a giant sandwich with hot peppers, mushrooms, and cheese and a side of red sauce to dip, it was delicious. The meat was very juicy and flavourful, on a super soft, freshly baked ciabatta bun. I ordered the Italian garden salad with grilled chicken on the side and it was very fresh and tasty! I look forward to trying the porchetta when we return ;)

They have a butchery section where you can purchase the same meats they grill for the sandwiches along with fresh grilled veggies. Great selection of various cured meats and cheeses. Would be a perfect place to stop for unique Italian groceries for a house party or for a hostess gift.

Loved the sections of prepared foods, condiments, olives, and dried pastas around the store. Picked up a few unique stocking stuffers for some family, including Nutella stuffed Italian wafer cookies, a delicious looking hot sauce cream, and a cute pack of sesame honey cookies. YUM!

We finished our lunch at Vicentina with an espresso, cappuccino, chocolate lobster tail pastry, and vanilla cannoli. Very delicious and satisfying way to spend a Sunday afternoon."}
{"text":"Very nice store with lots of quality meat, cheese etc. Got their steak cheese with cheese and mushroom (50 cents per topping). They freshly grill meat to order. Love the smokiness from the meat. It is a simple sandwich yet so satisfying. Huge portion size. I don't think I can finish one by myself unless I am starving. Heard their porchetta sandwich is also good. Many tables available but good luck during rush hours (lunch time during weekdays). This place gets packed every single day for lunch."}
{"text":"I came here on a colleague's recommendation and I'm glad I did.  It's tasty.  I ordered a veal sandwich, which was quite good but next time I'm trying the porchetta.  It's a super good idea to order in advance then you kind of bud to the front of the line and pay.  Often your order is made a little bit in advance but it's still delicious.  There's space to eat here but I took my sandwich and salad to go.  I love that you can select all your toppings.  The sandwich was warm even though I took it to go and they were generous with toppings.  I was really really happy.  Finding parking here is extremely messy.  Get here early!  It's hard to advise you to park in the lot because the customers are extremely aggressive and park wherever there is an available spot.  So it might be hard to get your car out once you've gotten it in!  Even still it's worth visiting."}
{"text":"Was craving porchetta after being at a buddies party on the weekend where they had a whole pig from Eddystone in North York, so me and the Mrs made the trip out here today to give their version of porchetta a shot.

We were really excited especially after seeing the beautiful roasts sitting there, but alas, it was quite disappointing when we actually ate the sandwich and realized there isn't a single piece of crispy skin (cracklings) in the sandwich at all.  They just take the meat out of the crispy skin and don't include ANY of it at all.  What the hell is the reason for this?  They are omitting the best part of the porchetta!

For this reason, I have to dock them 2 stars.  I'd put both Eddystone's porchetta above Vicentina and Porchetta & Co's in Toronto above them as well.  I just don't understand their reasoning for discarding the skin and not including any in the sandwich at all..

Maybe if we're lucky somebody who works here will read this and change their ways..  But I doubt it."}
{"text":"I came here with my husband for a quick bite to take home ready to eat. I tried the veal sandwich and my husband had the steak sandwich. Honestly, I didn't enjoy the veal that much. I found the veal should of been tenderized more as I found it a bit tough. It really could of used some salt and more sauce. I have had many veal sandwiches from many different places and I thought this would top all of my previous ones, but I was disappointed. It was okay. 

My husband had the steak sandwich, which he really liked. Lots of meat on it. You could taste the seasoning on it, it was hot and fresh. He said he wouldn't get the cheese added on but he would add the onion and peppers to it next time. 

If I came here again I would probably try the porchetta, it looked great. Try it out!"}
{"text":"You've never had a steak sandwich until you try this one!!

I crave this steak sandwich and anytime I get the chance in Vaughan, I scoop one.

You wont regret it."}
{"text":"I've never eaten at their food counter, or ordered a sandwich to go, this review is based strictly on their meat selections. A tad more expensive than other stores, the quality is good and the frozen food section quite large.
I've never been disappointed with anything I've purchased here, it's just that if you watch flyers, you can get the same quality meats for a cheaper price.
Staff have always been über friendly and the store is laid out well."}
{"text":"This review is strictly for the Steak Sandwich on a long panini with cheese, mushrooms and onions. That sandwich is definitely 5 star worth! As for the rest of their offerings, this is one serious meat retailer with a variety of fresh and frozen cuts of meats and seafood. They have a great selection of Italian antipasto foods along with what is supposed to be the best porketta pulled sandwiches anywhere.

The interior is about 25% cafe, 25% meat counters, 25% general groceries and 25% retail. I got there around noon on a Thursday and it was hard to find street parking. If you're parked around the store, even in perhaps a questionable spot, this seems to be one happy crowd of lunch people both eating in and taking out. No one seems to mind.

They have a selection of veal, chicken and steak sandwiches. I read some complaints about the veal sandwich however i wouldn't know that. It seemed as though the orders in the very long line (which does move quickly) were split between veal and steak.

As for the steal sandwich, I can still taste it and will probably jump in my car to make the 30 minute trek to have one. It's that good!"}
{"text":"This place has the best deli sandwiches!!! There's nothing like a round bread with steak, cheese, and mushrooms or if u don't like those toppings there's much more to choose from. Best place for a nice filling lunch. If wasn't in Vaughan would go much more often. It's too bad :("}
{"text":"Stopped at Vicentina meats to pick up a box of lamb speducci's.. Since it was Lunch time I thought why not Indulge in a veal sandwich. I placed my order ...veal sandwich on a whole wheat bun, hot peppers and mushrooms.  I stood waiting for twenty minutes while they slowly made sandwich after sandwich.  When they called my number I grabbed it and ran. By this time I was salivating in anticipation of that first bite. As I unwrapped my sandwich, first thing I noticed it was a white bun, I opened the bun to find the veal barely covered in sauce 8 slices of mushrooms (costing  50 cents extra) and a large hot pepper put in the middle. Should I continue to tell you how tasteless it was. It was like eating sawdust it was dry and chewy. I was so upset as I gave up eating my usual Lunch time salads for that special treat only to be disappointed. Unfortunately I was back at work and unable to return it.
I guess I am spoiled because this veal sandwich was a far cry from The California Sandwich which I am used to.
I am giving a 5 star for the Speducci's but only 1 star for the veal sandwich."}
{"text":"I'm a big plan of this place! To be quite honest I cant visit Vaughan Mills mall and not take the two minute drive to Vincentina meats.

A trip here will make you question why you EVER even tried a place like Subway, Mr. Sub, or Quiznos.

Know for the porchetta what keeps me coming back is the steak sandwich.
This sandwich is $5.79 and toppings about $0.50 each. Grilled hot and made to order this really cant be beat.

To be honest, when I go here I always get a second steak to go....it's that good.

I've tried the veal and the meatball, both good, but not as good as the steak.
The porchetta is also good and you can get some to go for $10 lb.

This place is great. OH - try the lamb speducci's at your next BBQ! These are always a big hit !

EDIT - Went to Vicentina meats Saturday Dec 14th around 2pm.
Got 5 sandwiches, two steak, 1 veal, 1 meatball, and 1  porchetta.
1 steak and the meatball were to go, the others for dine in.
I dont know if it was a bad day, but I was a lil upset.
Unlike the steak which as mentioned is cooked to order right infront of you other items are premade. The veal I got was good, but was cold. This really killed the whole experience for me. My mother had the pork and it was dry....really dry.
Sadly she did not mention this until she had eaten 1/2 .
I'll chalk this up to it simply being a bad day.........I wont write the place off!
But I was a lil upset."}
{"text":"Very good sandwiches (think veal, meat balls, etc) combined with a small grocery/butcher. Quick service even when they're busy, good for picking up lunch for an office amount of people.  I've been here twice recently."}
{"text":"Ordered a steak sandwich since it was their signature along with the porchetta. It was super flavourful, large pieces of steak - they give you a good amount of meat too. No complaints except the toppings are $1 each. Which adds up if you want cheese, onions, mushrooms, etc. The sandwich was decent sized (I think people are exaggerating when they say they cant eat it all in one sitting). Will likely return."}
{"text":"Food was very tasty!!  I only had the porchetta twice, both times the meat was soft, tender and flavourful!!!  I would like to try the steak panino next time.

Edited:
At the 3rd visit, I decided to try the steak one.  OMG! The steak was much better than the porchetta....I think I will stick with steak from now on!!!!"}
{"text":"This place needs more than 5 stars to accurately rate the food and service!!

By far the best Lamb Spadinni in the City!
Roasted red peppers, Bakery, Cold Cuts...baked treats they've got it all. Not a huge fan of their porchetta but it's fresh. 

It's a long drive from Scarborough but well worth it"}
{"text":"When you have a debilitating meat craving and are stuck in Vaughan's industrial wasteland , the sight of two cows atop a building may seem like a strange mirage.  

Vincentia is a panino & espresso bar, butcher and imported Italian food store all in one. Their delli section boasts a decent range of artisanal cured meats and cured sausages made in house. The panino selection is more modest. All the toppings have an additional $0.50 surcharge. As good as their steak panino was, I should have probably gone with the porchetta seeing as it is their signature sandwich. 
I will seriously consider their 10 lb porchetta roast for $100 when I'm expecting 20 people or so.  

All in all, a busy day of running errands quickly turned into enjoying a great lunch and watching the Napoli v. Milan game with a group of retired Italians yelling at the tv nonstop."}
