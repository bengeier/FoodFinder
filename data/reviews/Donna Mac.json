{"text":"This is what happens when a mixologist, great chef, and the best restaurant General Manager in the business decide to get together. This is a truly small plate restaurant that allows you to order 3-4 dishes, a couple of drinks, and not leave hungry or broke. The space is a wide open concept that is both beautiful and clean. The music is loud enough to feel the beat without drowning your conversation. The service is welcoming, attentive but not over the top hovering over you. Have been there twice. Great location to meet friends or a pre-post theatre destination. The duck was executed perfectly and the whole fish is succulent."}
{"text":"Was in today for brunch/lunch.  First the positives.  Great atmosphere  and service.  Love the space.  We tried 3 different desserts, the one bite smore (really tasty but if you don't like rosemary, skip it), the fennel cake (very nice subtle anise flavour and lovely lemon sauce, but the texture of the cake was very grainy), and finally the chocolate pudding dish (yummy!).    

Now the not so good.  I had the Cuban sandwich which was incredibly disappointing.  The pork was some grey almost pressed textured meat.  It's been 4 hours and I am still burping it.  There was no crispiness to the bread, rather it was quite soggy and greasy.  The kale salad as a side was the best part of the dish.  My friend had the veggie sandwich and liked it.  Someone else had the mushroom tourtiere and gave it a mixed review.  The filling was very tasty but the crust was tasteless and dry.  It looked like it had been reheated one too many times.  

We won't be back.  The space and service can't make up for the below average food.  :("}
{"text":"Great place to go with friends and share food. There was six of us, and we got about 9 plates. Really fun and social. Look forwards to going back. Also, just picked up a fresh sourdough bread from them this week. I recommend that."}
{"text":"Pretty interior and great ambience! Everything we had was delicious, and they have some interesting cocktails available. Excellent homemade sourdough and I'd recommend the cauliflower bites!"}
{"text":"Given the proximity of this place to where I live, I have watched this place go up over the last year in anticipation to see what was in store. When it finally opened I was excited to try it out and see if there was another local joint i could frequent. 

Walking by, I've often gazed in, seeing a relaxed, upscale atmosphere with large windows and casual, bistro style table arrangements. When I finally visited I found the ambiance to meet these expectations, though I did find that the lighting for the tables themselves was a bit dim, such that I wasn't really able to inspect my food to see what it looked like. The candles are also fake battery ones, which took more away from the upscale casual mood that I expected it would.... real tea lights are not difficult - that would be an easy fix. 

Service was on par with what I would expect from a restaurant at this price point - they were friendly and helpful. 

The Tapas sharing style is popular these days, and I was interested to see how Donna Mac would execute it. The menu is a brief one pager, which is good - don't want to get too complicated, I'd rather have them focus on a handful of things at a time. For two, it was suggested that two \"appetizer sized and two entree sized plates\" would be filling. We opted for the Eggplant and tomatoes (with sourdough) and the scallop tartare for appie sized dishes, and the duck breast and tagliatelle for our two entree plates. 

Overall, I found the quality and taste of the food to be quite mediocre, for a comparatively high price point - this left a lot to be desired. The scallop tartare was an extremely small portion size, though the flavour profile was great - realistically a double portion of that is a more practical split for two people to have a taste. The sourdough with eggplant and tomatoes was disappointing. The sourdough was on the charred end of grilled in an unpleasant way, and the tomatoes and eggplant \"bruschetta\" style was too salty and tart.

I had a similar response to the pasta. I was told it was \"home made\", but I found it to be both a little undercooked as well as a little too dense, which resulted it it being tougher to eat, which was not impressive. The flavour profile of the pasta was also very boring - the \"pork ragu\" consisted of a few chunks of shredded pork. 

Finally, the duck breast. The breast itself was cooked nicely and not overdone, but it relied on the other components of the dish for flavour. The main profile was a vinaigrette, which was fine, but I found that the balance of the flavour profile with the texture and choice of vegetables  in addition to the natural flavour and texture of the duck to be off - as if the combination was a valiant effort to be creative but fell short on having the flavours and textures come together hamoniously. 

Overall, I found that the suggested quantity was not enough to be full, tho we didn't leave ravenously hungry. at this price point ($70 incl tip, excl drinks), I am expecting better... I will give this another shot when they change up the menu to see if they can change my mind."}
{"text":"Lunch with Z and my gf at this very trendy and bright corner resto. It wasn't very busy so we were seated quickly. Our waiter was fantastic and answered our questions with knowledge and enthusiasm. 

We settled on a vegan Mac burger served with fries and I had the pork salad. Our food was out in about 15min and looked deelish!  I tried a bite of Z's burger which was amazing. My pork salad had a unique mix of greens- arugula, sliced jalape√±os, cilantro, pear, thinly sliced pork with a savoury vinaigrette. I could have eaten two bowls! I was torn between this item and the shredded duck with lentils. 

I like that this resto focuses on fresh ingredients and healthy eating without compromising flavour. Next we had dessert- pie of the day which had a flaky bottom crust, Saskatoon berries and a light crumble topped with Chantilly cream. It was not too sweet or tart and a perfect finish to my salad.  Z had the birthday cake with a scoop of bubblegum vodka flavoured ice cream. He was blown away by ice cream that tasted like hubba bubba, LOL!!! 

I think I will book my a dinner here. They also offer brunch."}
{"text":"Was excited to try Donna Mac after hearing great things. Unfortunately it left a lot to be desired and will not be going back. I appreciate the simplicity of a menu but as a non pork eater there was only one entree option that was neither vegetarian or pork. Our server suggested 6 dishes to split between 4 of us so we ordered a few appetizers, a pasta, risotto and short rib. The first dish was the scallop tartare and I laughed when it came out because it literally looked like 1 scallop. The short rib was 7 ultra thin slices (for $32 mind you). While the taste and service was pretty good, portion sizes are a joke. They did have a good cocktail and wine selection. 

Needless to say I went home after a night out with friends to cook a meal. Save your money, there are plenty of other great restaurants in the city."}
{"text":"The staff is friendly and the food is amazing. It's definitely worth a stop by. The storefront itself is very clean and well decorated."}
{"text":"I was excited to try this beautiful place and had heard good things. I arrived at 6pm and it was dead (minor moment of panic) but fortunately filled up quickly. Very pretty ambiance. I had the vegan pasta with mushroom, arugula, and almond cream and it tasted great, but was a little heavy on the sauce. Lemon bars were delicious. Service was a bit awkward. I think they need to decide if they want to be upscale or family style, right now they're trying to be both."}
