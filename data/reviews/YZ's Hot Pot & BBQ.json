{"text":"This place is not open on sundays. We drove there before their posted hours, on Yelp it showed they were open until midnight on Sundays n were closed at around o:30pm."}
{"text":"I never give 1 star before. But this time... We wait here for over 30 minutes to get our hot pot. When we finally got it so disappointing. The hot pot is really really has no flavor, it tastes like nothing even we order a spicy flavor! So does the BBQ.   And it wait so long! We just decided move to another restaurant."}
{"text":"This place is great. The food is really quite good. It has something for everyone. For the not so adventurous eaters you can go with the yakitori or beef, and for the very adventurous there are lots of options.   The hot pots are quite good. We split a spicy beef and got items off the BBQ menu. Our favorite was the cabbage, SO good. Also the beef, yakitori and jalepenos were awesome with a sweet delicious sauce.   I definitely recommend trying this place out."}
{"text":"This restaurant used to be good but unfortunately the quality has been slowly declining. The food and services aren't as good as they used to be."}
{"text":"Really excited that a hot pot restaurant is now nearby. Decided to give it a try and it was very satisfying! Cool ambiance, welcoming staff, great food! Must try the octopus appetizer!   Ordered a hot pot and split it between two of us. Enough to share, even without the add-ons.  Will come back!   Oh and free ice cream with every hot pot?! Score!   There are chef specials that we will come back to try!"}
{"text":"Worst service ever!! Went here for a family dinner and waited more than 30 minutes for our food which didn't come all at once. We were told that rice came with our entrees, but the rice never came. After 10 more minutes, I asked about the rice, and they said they had to cook more. At this point everyone in the whole restaurant (small place) had been eating for 20 minutes with no new orders. It was apparent that they forgot to make more (hard to imagine in an asian restaurant). I did ask how this was possible and was told they gave it to the carryout order that just happened (we were here first). I have now been waiting for an hour as I decided to type this review for an awful dinner. The candle in our hot pot has already burned out while waiting! Unbelievable!!!"}
{"text":"Ambiance was nice but service was really slow. No sushi though. Ordered fried rice, grilled eggplant, and two skewers. Fried rice came out 30 minutes after ordering and we waited another 10 for the remainder of our food, until we finally asked the waitress.  She reported that it was still coming and the guy working the grill had a lot of orders. Waited another 20 minutes and no more food. It was getting late and we had to leave. They comp'd our rice dish and apologized. We left and had to look for dinner elsewhere."}
{"text":"Great place for hot pot but the rest of the menu was somewhat lacking. The hot pot was good but the second time I went and ordered menu items the food didn't have much flavor and the proportions were small."}
{"text":"I can't speak for flavor as my companion opted to take us elsewhere. However I can say that this restaurant is immaculate and very eye pleasing. However, the decision to leave was prompted by some of the....non-traditional menu items that come to mind when thinking of Asian cuisine here stateside. This is an experience for the familiar and the bold who look to expand their gastronomic horizons. If you are looking for panda, don't turn right on Broadway. I will be back to eat and review again...alone."}
{"text":"after a long day of driving we yelp this place with excitement to find it was closed when it clearly states opened til 12midnight"}
{"text":"I had been here twice with friends. Very disappointed. Food is alright, but the price is more impressive. Would never come back."}
{"text":"really cant go wrong with hot pot. the service needs a bit of work. Takes too long to get orders, food, check etc. However, casual trendly and good for late night food and dates.   The meat is frozen. not a huge fan of this. but all in all would definitely go again."}
{"text":"Been there for like 40 minutes and they told me that they were cooking for the delivery orders so they can't be able to serve me shortly. Guess what, I am the only customer in the store at least that time. I end up just left the store without having any food because the boss is too afraid to apologize in front of me. Never ever go to there again because your food will never come."}
{"text":"Went last Sat night pulled up around 8:30 the parking lot was empty it looked dark inside & I thought they were closed, now I wish they were! We walked in to see 2 people at a table & 4 VERY LOUD people at the bar so pretty much dead, someone mopping the floor told us to sit anywhere so we headed across the sticky floor to sit at a sticky table. As it turns out the person mopping the floor was are server tho we did not know that for 10 min till he brought are menus. We ordered a few beers and he disappeared after another 10 min of listening to the blaring Hip-Hop music only to be out noised buy the 4 VERY LOUD people at the bar and while trying not to have a seizure from the ridiculous green strobe light flashing I was ready to walk out! But my wife wanted to stay as she heard the food was that good? So as my wife went to hunt down are beers I went outside for a smoke only to find the 4 from the bar doing the same. After listening to them loudly talk about all the different drugs they have tried I went back in to see are beers & apps on the table & are waiter mopping the floors again. Now it just the 2 of us inside and the food still took forever. Once it finally came out we went to the condiment station for are dipping sauces & toppings all empty WTF no scallion no cilantro everything gone! we looked around but no one was to be found so we scraped what little we could from the bottom of the pans walked back across the still sticky floor and sat at are sticky table. By this point I was done with this place!!! Now my wife is telling me she has a headache from the loud music I was so pissed I never ate, after someone finally came out from the back I asked for it to go. Once we got home the food was good so there is that... But NEVER AGAIN not me I don't care how good the food is that type of experience is uncalled for in any restaurant!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"This place is the best late night Asian bar I ever tried! They have hot pot and charcoal grill bbq here! 6 dollars sake bomb can't beat that! Must try!"}
{"text":"This is the saddest place to go. Waited 20 min to order. Like everyone else be prepared to wait 1 hour before ordering your first drink . I do not recommend this restaurant to anyone . Please close this place down."}
{"text":"Went here one night on a friend's hunger whim for hotpot. It feels more like a bar....a Japanese bar. They have BBQ grilling that they do right at the bar. We ordered a few kind of yakitori's, and from the taste of them, they ALL had the exact same seasoning powder that they sprinkle on. So they all tasted pretty much the same flavor except the protein that you chose. As for the actual hotpot, it was pretty good. The flavor of the broth was there, very yummy. Their \"pots\" are very shallow, i would about 2 inches deep meant for one person meal. And then the price goes up as you add extra ingredients such as lamb slices, egg noodles, glass noodles....and so on. This can get expensive really quick. Its a cool hangout actually, with K-pop on the TV's and a pretty cool decor!"}
{"text":"I'd been meaning to go to this place for a while. I really like that they are open late until 2am! The hot pot was awesome, and priced pretty reasonable. We ordered two hot pots and shared them both to try the different flavors. Both pots we ordered had great, unique broths and tasted wonderful.   The reason for the 1 star off is for the service. There was very few customers (2 other small tables) in the restaurant and the two girls working started off great, but then towards the end of our dinner they kinda forgot about us (meaning sitting on their phones, eating and flirting with a friend that came in). We waited forever for our check and eventually had to make awkward eye contact to flag her down, lol.   So, overall the food & price is awesome despite the okay-ish service. I'm sure I'll end up going back, mainly because the food is worth it for me and I just love hot pot that much! :D"}
{"text":"Im happy to found this place last night. We r total 5ppl and ordered spicy beef soup first and it was delicious but the quantity is soooo small :(   so we had to order sth big. I do not remember the name of second order soup. It was about $17 and huge. It was also delicious and quite impressive. Also the servers and owner r so kind to us. Im definitely going back to this place soon. Sooooooo nice place to drink."}
{"text":"One of the greatest service I've had. Very hard working worker! Delicious food and short wait time. Thank you!"}
{"text":"a lovely little place south of ASU.  tried their individual hot pot, which is very popular in east Asia but rare in Arizona.  the pot comes with 6 base options and you can add extra add on. overall, very happy about the experience."}
{"text":"This place is amazing. The hot pots are huge - definitely big enough for 2 - and they are spicy (if you ask for it), full of lots of different delicious things like kimchi, mushrooms, steak, clams, fish, etc, etc, etc. We're here for our third time in 3 weeks."}
{"text":"Powerfully bland food. And the front house staff was so bad. Only one of them really worked and was doing everything. She spent most of her time telling customers she was sorry. I wanted to like that place, but now I won't consider it an option at all."}
{"text":"I was soo damn excited to try this place, being really close by, and being raised on authentic Chinese/Hong Kong hot pot in LA and HI. I read all the reviews, got excited, and went. :( I hate to give low scores, but this is based off of my total experince. They get one less star because of lack of correct business information posted here as far as business hours, and BBQ hours. They also seriously need a website. This is an aweful business practice, and they could be making some serious improvements. Businesses need to be on top of these basic and fundamental things!! Wth?  Well, fist off, on yelp, it says they are open at 11am. Nope. When I arrived excitedly, sign says 5-2am. Ok. No prob. Ill come back!  Next day I go back, yayyy! Upon entering, I am bombarded by loud and obnoxious techno that keeps reapeating itself. Other than that, the decor was cute, and as everyone described here. The techno music put me on edge lol. I could not relax to enjoy my experience. With a few tables filled, did the music need to be so loud?  On to the menu and service...  We had originally come to try this famous rice ball everyones been talking about, and possibly get some little vegetarian BBQ sides, similar to yakitori. When I mentioned the word \"yakitori\", the waitress dressed in Japanese garb was like \"what u say?\"... ok right, this is Chinese owned Chinese/Hong Kong restaurant... she was nice. She priceeds to tell me that the BBQ menu is only avail Thurs - Sat. What!? You guys seriously need to update your yelp info!! I already missed eating here once cause your hours are posted wrong, and now I sat there unable to try what I came here for?! :(  In my observation service was not very efficient or quick. Service was slow as I observed in general. It was not busy, so I couldint understand why our server was not more attendant.  We had ordered a sake bomb to share, and no second cup was brought out... had to ask.  The food itself was great. I always order vegetarian things, so I was happy there were an item here and there was. I had a terrific eggplant dish that itself deserves 5 stars. We also shared the tomato vegetarian hot pot. Lighter in flavor than others I've had in my life, it was still yummy. It said there was supposed to be lotus root in there. When I told my server there was none, she was like \"oh really? Sorry.\" Nothing to correct the situation. We shared it. Its made for one. And it comes with a choice of two dipping sauces... they sucked. See in LA, you get all these sauces at the table for FREE and they are authentic and damn good. I could tell they Americanized the dipping sauces here. :(  Over all, slightly dissaponted. And just wish AZ had a really bomb and authentic hot pot experience. Hong Kong hot pot that im used to feeds four cause the pots so damn huge, and its like $15-$20. For one pot here its $10 +. :(  We were finished with our meal for a good 10 min, and began to gather our things before she noticed to give us our check. Where did our free ice cream go that everyone was raving about? We did not get any. :(  I see where everyones been confused about this place. Its Japanese decored, but Hong Kong style food. Maybe they should consider changing the theme to stop the confusion lol.  I will give it a try again, just to get my asian food fix nearby. But I hope for better dining experiences."}
{"text":"Great food period!  Great variety on the menu and after I ordered numerous little things, i have to go back for more!"}
{"text":"We tried two hot pots. Obviously, this place tries to copy \"boiling point\" but it is absolutely a failure. The seafood pot has no flavors. It is a long wait for the food to come and then for the pot to boil with such a small fire.  Besides, it is too expensive for so little food. I will never go back."}
{"text":"First time here, the service was great! They were very quick and friendly. The food was delicious , atmosphere was cute! You can smell the yummy food from outside ^.^ I'm definitely coming back with my boyfriend for a date. Me and my friend ordered Unagi buns and hot pot it was soooo good. The broth was packed with flavor. I want to try everything on the menu."}
{"text":"My buddy suggested this place.  He said that his friend came here a couple of weeks ago and really liked it, especially the fried octopus.  Well at lunch fried octopus is on the menu.  When you drive up the windows are so darkly tinted it looks closed, but that won't stop my friend and I and I am pretty happy we did.    The music is way to loud, to the point where we were almost yelling at each other to have a conversation.  Luckily no one else was I the restraunt.   We ordered the spicy beef hot pot; then added quail eggs, slices of beef, slices of lamb, tofu, fried tofu, cabbage.  Each add-on cost extra, but our total bill was only $25.00.  I have only eaten hot pot at my parents house, so I have no clue if that is expensive or not.  It also came with a bowl of rice (my friend added one more bowl for $1).  Again this was unusual to me because I've never had rice with hot pot.  The flavors of everything was really good.  I hit pot had imitation krab meat and corn in the soup. This just seemed very different for me.  Though I do love my parent's hot pot, so I know that I am super biased.   My friend ended up going there again the next night and said they have a different menu at night and it had the fried octopus, which he said was very good.  He felt the side dishes at night had more pieces of beef, six compared to the four slices we got at lunch.  I think I might try this place again.  Maybe."}
{"text":"Pretty disappointing right before a race for them to forget about our food. The fried rice came and it was okay, but everything else we ordered wasn't coming. We asked and they said they were short staffed. 45 minutes later we asked for the bill. They were apologetic and said they forgot to put the order in."}
{"text":"Food is yummy, hot pots are affordable. Only complaint is the long wait for service and food, but the food is good enough to keep me coming back!"}
{"text":"Hot pots here are full of rubber bath toys that will burn ur tongue. Usually i love the broth, but this had zero flavor. Im hungry still.. I had a really good hot pot in LA once. This was a pretty sad comparison. Im surprised it had so many asians in it, ASU explains it i guess. Damnit! Id totally go to chipotle right now if my tongue wasn't fried. I JUST NEEDED FOOD N ALL I GOT WAS TOYS!!"}
{"text":"Best fried rice I've ever had, very authentic. All my friends loved their food. Awesome music too, they were playing CL from 2ne1."}
{"text":"Found this place on yelp so we decided to check it out. They were a bit understaffed but other than that we had a few favorites. I'll start with what I didn't like.   The service was kinda.. Ehh. We had to raise our hands to get our server's attention the whole time we were there. They were also slow with clearing up our table. I ordered an Asahi that came warm; they didn't have chilled glasses as well.  We ordered the octopus balls because they were deemed a \"must-have\" on yelp. I LOVE octopus but I DO NOT recommend this dish. It was soft and gooey, nothing close to what takoyaki should be. And it tasted horrible. I had the pork katsu bento and it was ok; pork was realy chewy though. The Taiwan sausage bento wasn't too good--the sausage was dry and cold like it was from the day before.   And now my favorites. The Kimchee Fried Rice was absolutely fantastic. It had bacon in it too which makes it even better. A MUST HAVE is the garlic crab. It's heaven in your mouth!   Although I have mixed feelings I'll come back to order the stuff I like."}
{"text":"My first time here I was seated quickly since I came early in the evening. I purchased three Groupons for $7 off per Groupon. I chose the Seafood Miso hot pot and it was beautifully sizzling. I asked for an extra plate for clam, shrimp, and crab shells. It was delicious and the waiter was able to guide me through the do-it-yourself sauces and answered my questions."}
{"text":"Homemade hotpot is better than their hotpot. Hotpot additional items are too pricy consider the amount they give you. Service is extremely slow due to the fact they usually have only one waitress actually working."}
{"text":"Walking in the environment was pretty cool. Service was slow, and there were no one else to serve besides us. Food was alright. Service still sucked, had to ask so many times for silverware."}
{"text":"This place has terrible service so I wouldn't bother going.  I can't review on the food because I never Had a chance to try due to the terrible long wait. I came to this place with a friend we waited over an hour and 30 mins and never got our food and left. I have never encountered this type of service until now."}
{"text":"Your hours clearly say open until 2 am. Yet you refuse to serve us and it's only 1250am? Wow. Either your management needs this figured out or hire new servers. Really disappointed at this place. Good way to drive away regular customers"}
{"text":"I am actually a traveler. I wish I could stay here as long as possible. Or maybe they could open another store in Boston. Service is good. I like the girl a lot. And food is very well presented and prepared. Very fresh I can tell. I ordered seafood hotpot and my friend ordered spicy beef hotpot. I would strongly recommend seafood hotpot!!  I will visit AZ again in a year maybe 2. I will definitely come by again."}
{"text":"Well, tonight was my second time here.  The first night was \"OK\", but tonight, I have a different opinion.  I arrived about 20 minutes after they opened at 5 pm.  I ordered the Kim-chi Hot Pot.  All was going well.  The hot pot, rice, and dipping sauces arrived to the table in less than 10 minutes.  I was excited to dig in.  Soon after poking around in the pot I quickly noticed that there were no mushrooms, fish balls, crab meat, or rice cake.  At first I thought I had ordered incorrectly so I interrupted the waitress from her full blown conversation with another staff person at the bar to come and let me know what was up.  She promptly explained to me that they were planning to close for a month starting tomorrow, so none of these items are available right now in preparation for the shut down.  Now, would you not think it appropriate to inform me that I would be paying $12.99 for a pot of boiling cabbage, tofu, and hot dog slices?  I could have opened some top ramen at home and thrown my own spices, hot dogs and cabbage in it.  Shame on you!!!!  Too bad, though.  Even though this isn't the best hot pot place, it is the only one close to me and I am pretty sure I won't go back."}
{"text":"I came here specifically for the hot pot. I ordered the spicy beef hot pot.. The broth is not very flavorful . Also they are very stingy on the meat. I also ordered a Taiwanese sausage from their BBQ menu. It was awful ! (you know what I'm talking about! )Service was terrible as well, there was only one waitress for the entire time. She didn't even bring the rice and dipping sauce until I'm half way done eating . Will never be back again... I don't understand how restaurant owners put mediocre stuff on the menu and expect people to pay for it. They are totally trying to copy Boiling point but way off ."}
{"text":"CLOSEST to LA quality atmosphere and cuisine in Tempe, good hot pot, SUPER GOOD fried Udon noodles. This is my new weekend night spot. Strongly recommend."}
{"text":"Loved this place and will be back again! So nice to have a new, different, choice in the neighborhood.  The staff was really nice and showed us how to order, add items in our hot pot, and made suggestions from the grill.  The grill items are like sushi or tapas in that they are small, economically priced, portions, and you can try a bunch.  We went nuts, had a beer, and still had a very reasonable check.  Our 8-yr old boy was with us too and they were great to him!"}
{"text":"Cool atmosphere and nice staff. The food is reasonably priced for what you get. My wife is Taiwanese and is quite happy with the quality of the food.  The hot pot is above table (not an inside the table hot pot you get in Asia)    Really enjoyed the California rolls.   Definitely would recommend this place for anyone looking for hot pot or a cool asian restaurant for date night."}
{"text":"This place is a lot of fun, and a pretty interactive dining experience. Definitely recommend the spicy beef hot pot, and hard to beat $6 sake bombs on happy hour.   They are remodeling this summer, and will be even better come the fall!"}
{"text":"Love this place... Authentic with good variety, if you don't like what you got- try ordering something else... Extensive menu so waitress recomendation is best, will forsure return!"}
{"text":"My roommate and I decided to try this place out for dinner since we live nearby and had never been there before. We were immediately greeted by our waitress, and we asked to sit at the bar.  She showed us the menus, but everything looked so food,  we really had no idea where to start. Justin,  the BBQ cook was right in front of us and took a lot of time guiding us through the menu, reccomending items,  and even giving us samples of a few items. We ordered the kimchi hotpot,  which we ordered with rice noodles because my roommate is allergic to gluten, they were totally accommodating and it was great! We also had fried tofu, bacon wrapped onions,  lamb,  jalapenos, chives,  beef wrapped asparagus, yellow tail and another dish that had egg and seafood in it.  Everything was great, but the lamb was a favorite.   Justin also recommended a raspberry wine,  a peach sake,  and a bottle called chum churn,  which was delicious, but dangerous!  Everything was so good that we literally asked for our check and changed our minds to order more food.  I actually left to pick up my boyfriend and bring him back to enjoy the experience with us.   We can't wait to go back and are already planning what we will have on our next visit!"}
{"text":"Simple, awesome, cool staff. Gotta support delicious legit asian food spots w cool peeps. I eat here everytime im in town for work.   Rice ball, just get it.  Bacon asparagus, get it.  Sake offering is legit  Awesome throwback edm.    Best spot ive found in this area  for epic yakitori."}
{"text":"I absolutely love their food here. Everything I've had is super delicious! Workers are friendly and helpful! I don't know why they don't have better reviews but I've thoroughly enjoyed every single visit here! A must try!"}
{"text":"I decided to come back here to try other dishes and I must say I was NOT disappointed. This time was better than the first time.  This time I had the Spicy Beef hot pot, which I absolutely LOVE. I actually prefer this than the Seafood hot pot. It has more flavor and the spice level was on point. We also ordered the Lamb, Chicken, and Beef skewer, let's say with every bite you have a burst of delicious flavor in your mouth. I highly recommend it!"}
{"text":"Food was good, we ordered the spicy beef hot pot. One is enough for two people!! They had ridiculousness on TV and the atmosphere seemed ok!  Was a really nice night. The waitress brought our bill out instead of our ice cream that was supposed to be part of the meal, but mistakes happen!  We bought a groupon deal for this place, and we spent $29, however, they said we HAVE to order $15 each to use the groupon. It didn't say this anywhere on the Groupon and the manager finally came over and fixed the situation. However, 5-10minutes of them fighting over $1 (that's assuming they were correct) really dropped a bomb on the entire evening. It just brought out their true money-hungry nature.   Food was good, but they knew we were having a special evening, and I don't like somebody telling us about a fine print which did not exist over ONE DOLLAR!   Waste. 2 for the food."}
{"text":"This place is cute and cozy. Not a big restaurant but surely feels comfy. The food is surprisingly good. Especially the Takoyaki! Mmmm... I want some more :) Tried pork feet rice plate today and it was perfectly cooked, not too crunchy not too tender... I'm definitely coming back to try out some hot pot soon! Highly recommend."}
{"text":"Worst service in Tempe!!! The food is not good as well. Moreover, if you can get your food, it means you are lucky! No waiter serve you until you are leaving."}
{"text":"I have been craving hot pot for a while now so we decided to come here and give this place a try. We ordered the spicy beef and the mixed seafood pots. I was a little surprised when the pots came out and all of the meat and veggies were already in the pots. I was a little worried the veggies would be a little overcooked and mushy and the meat a little overcooked. Unfortunately, I was right, which was kind of a bummer. The spicy beef pot was ok. The seafood pot was significantly better. There was a large variety of seafood (shrimp, clam, octopus, shrimp ball, imitation crab, and half of a whole crab plus some beef?) in there and I was happy about that. The broth of the pots had really good flavor, they were just really light in flavor. I wish the flavor was stronger. The pots came with bowls of rice and some glass noodles. The seafood pot was supposed to come with udon but we didn't get any udon. To add more flavor, don't forget to ask for additional side sauces they provide."}
{"text":"4 stars because the food was amazing, but the service was really bad. I had to hunt down the waitress for refills on water, sake, and even things as trivial as brining me my whole order. I got the spicy beef hot pot which was way spicier than I thought it would be (which I loved) but she forgot to bring utensils and the side of rice that comes with it etc. overall definitely check it out if you like hot pot. Totally worth it. Just be prepared for sub par service."}
{"text":"Cute small place.  We had 8 of us thank goodness we had a reservation but the food took so long:  From appetizers to our actually meals. They forgot a lot.  Our drinks were also empty.  The servers are hit and miss:  1 server was helpful and 1 server was not happy to be there.  It was like we were bothering her."}
{"text":"LOVE this place! The first place I can find in AZ has real Asian style BBQ Skewer. It's a small and cozy place. Good for date night and girls night to just enjoy the food since they open late till 12pm or 2am. We only try BBQ last night, and the taste is indeed perfectly delicious! Most of other BBQ place either make them too salty or sweet or sour, etc... Just doesn't taste right. But in here you don't have to worry about it at all. Staff are very polite and friendly. Give out good recommendation. A very nice dine-in experience. Will come back and try their Hot Pot or Bento next time."}
{"text":"A friend of mine wanted to get some spicy food and a few drinks at about 11:30PM, after looking around the area we found YZ and just stopped in. They were playing club music, pretty cool environment. We had Sushi and their beef hot pot bowl, plus a few drinks. I liked the way we could watch them make our Sushi at the bar. The owner and chef, Justin, even came over to ask how are experience was. Nice touch.  Want to have an upbeat atmosphere and some great food late at night, this is a place to go and try out."}
{"text":"This is my first time here with my friends because I grew up eating hot pot and have always wanted to try this place. We ordered two hotpots and appetizers and they were AMAZING. The food and atmosphere are fabulous, but the only reason I'm giving them three stars is the customer service here. They are run by Chinese girls who love speaking Mandarin to each other and the Mandarin customers they know. They check up with them more and come by to check/talk. We had a group of 5, which they never came to check on us and never filled our drinks. They're also supposed to serve ice cream with every hotpot order and when we grabbed our server, she said they only have vanilla which we were ok with and then another server comes up to us and says they're all out... They could at least give us a discount or another free dessert... would come back for food but not for the service. I only tipped small for the server because she was the only one who was bringing out the food. The other girl was mostly talking and in the back."}
{"text":"I was referred to this place by a friend and she said it was OK. So, I had to find out for myself. Two other friends and I went on Friday and I was surprised to hear that it was open until 2am.  The staff greeted us and were very friendly.   We ordered two different types of hot pots. One was the seafood hot pot and the other one was the spicy beef. We also had side orders of lambs on a stick, beef on a stick, and also chicken. All the meats on a stick was really good, ver flavorful.   If I had to choose a hot pot, the spicy beef one was really good. Overall, it was worth a try and doesn't break too much of your wallet. I'll be going there again soon."}
{"text":"I really like this place. I live across the street from it, and the lamb BBQ is fantastic.  I really enjoy the Mapoh Tofu Rice, along with the seaweed salad.  They have interesting dishes here, and it's really hard to find a place like this in Phoenix.  Owners are really nice, too.   I come here often."}
{"text":"Shitty food shitty services, why would everyone want to go back here and eat ? Huh ? Cuz they put a lot of msg in the food and make it tasty?"}
{"text":"Interesting place...disco ball, techno/rap/hip hop music but the food is worth the wait! We had a kombu salad (thick black seaweed) and \"smashed\" cucumbers. Wowza it's hot stuff!!! The main attraction was the hot pot--very unique flavors with a hot pot dipping sauce bar too!"}
{"text":"Really solid. Despite the Takoyaki being just ok and a minor mixup on our order for garlic crab, everything was really good. Highly recommend the salt and pepper shrimp. Beef with scallions, and garlic crab. Everything was fresh and priced great. All the little grilled dishes are fresh and cheap. Fun to try different things. Will be back for hot pot and soju."}
{"text":"Second round of Hot Pot and I'm impressed. I love the food here and the service is good. Definitely a small place with huge potential. I love the sweet potato fries, I love the pot stickers, I love the ANGUS SHISHKABOB!"}
{"text":"If I could give them zero stars, I would. We came in on a Tuesday night.  The service was piss poor and the food was mediocre.  All the ingredients they used for their hot pots were not fresh, but frozen ingredients.  We saw a group of four walk out because the waitresses never came back for them.  It took 45 minutes just to get our food. And a additional 50 minutes tp get our check.  I will never ever go back again. I was pissed that the tip was included with the bill. I didn't even want to pay."}
{"text":"New owner and the service have gotten a lot better than a few months ago. Now it is just the owner and his wife. Food is still good! Will come back"}
{"text":"They need more help.  The chef is the server and cashier.  Maybe because it's a Monday afternoon?  The food was ok.  The only worker did a decent job, but she needs more help."}
{"text":"The smaller plates and dishes tasted great! The soups were all a bit bland. I love that this place is open late. The crowd here mostly consists of the international asian kids at ASU. Service was prompt. My main concern was that the soup lacked flavor but everything else I tried was good."}
{"text":"My friend and I came here in hopes of finding a hot-pot spot closer than Shabu Fondue.   What we didn't realize, is this place has pre-concocted hot pot, and you simply order 1 of 6 broth/ingredient combinations. This was all well and good, and the hot pot was actually quite delicious, but it sort of takes the fun out of what hot pot is!   Only other qualm is the spicy beef bowl (which I ordered at \"medium\" level spice) was INSANELY hot to the point where my nose was running and my tongue actually hurt. Mind you, I LOVE spicy food. Grew up on Cajun chili peppers, wasabi, and oodles of sriracha and cholula. But this stuff was so hot, I couldn't enjoy any flavor. The staff was kind enough to swap my broth for something more mellow, which I appreciated!"}
{"text":"This is a great place to go for a late night meal, since the Phoenix area doesn't have many late Asian restaurants to go to. I've only tried their hot pots here and it's okay. The environment is pretty good. The service is just okay as well."}
{"text":"I'm glad I gave this place a chance The food and the owner justin made the whole experience very enjoyable The lamb BBQ on the skewer was the best thing I've had in awhile We also tried a seafood hotpot that was great too Definitely wanna try more dishes there"}
{"text":"A place to add some variety to chinese food in phoenix area"}
{"text":"Well, gave it a second chance. Make a reservation this time and got our table without wait. Good! Unfortunately, the wait for our food was still long. Order the vegetable hotpot, only two bites of the clear noodles were inside the pot; had to order extra noodle. They most likely thought whoever ordered the vegetable hotpot didn't have to eat much. Two waitresses, one was nice, smile and talk to us; another one, sorry we bother you!"}
{"text":"I am in need for a serious Shabu Shabu place but hot pot will have to do.   Dan and I visited in an attempt to satisfy the Shabu craving and I have mixed feeling about this place.   First, atmosphere is definitely fun. Not very big. Has kind of a ramen bar feel ( if you know asian food know what I mean ).   The food though wasn't what I expected. It's more of a Chinese hotpot style place. We got the spicy beef hotpot and just by itself it's like 3 stars. I feel like it's authentic which is good! But personally for my taste I need more. Especially more meat.   That being said, I didn't get any BBQ or add ons which I regret. I feel like adding the extra stuff would have pushed this place to a 4 star.   Final verdict is I'll definitely be back but we ll order smarter and try more stuff. This place has potential :)  Atmosphere 4/5  Food 3/5 Price 3/5"}
{"text":"Shitty food with shitty services, will never come back !!! If you Like to eat uncooked food with mean Services, you are welcome to be there !"}
{"text":"Any time's a good time for hot pot, even when it's over 100 degrees outside! They offer combination hot pot meals, which are a great deal in that it includes a lot of veggies, noodles, and meat rather than at other places where you pay a la carte for your ingredients. They do have a la carte options though, for those that want a more customized experience.  We shared a lamb hot pot and a seafood hot pot. There were a plethora of ingredients in both. The lamb broth was more light tasting and a little oily. I enjoyed the seafood broth as it had more flavor.  The decor is a mix of contemporary and traditional, with traditional style Japanese wall murals and more modern styled tables and chairs. They've made good use of the small space they have.  They also have sushi, and other Japanese foods, such as takoyaki.   Overall, I enjoyed my meal and will definitely come here again!"}
{"text":"This place is legit. All the hot pot and noodles you can dream of. Free rice, which is always a bonus for a young broke college student. Love coming here to sake bomb with my friends. And not only is the food good, it is a family-run business with great service. These people put their heart and soul into what they make and I, for one, appreciate it. Jimmy, you're the best, man!"}
{"text":"Finally a hot pot restaurant that fill me up without emptying my wallet. Great environment for small group of people to try out their hot pot.   Was told this is the place for great hot pot and bbq. Was very happy about the experience with this restaurants. The owner couple are very young, energized and friendly.   Although the background music is a little loud, but I was focusing on the food too much. Don't go there after 7:00pm to mid-night over weekend unless you want to hang out with young Chinese crowd.   They did offer different sauce for the hot pot, but you have to ask for it. My favorite is the the seafood hot pot."}
{"text":"My first time here last night. They play clubbing music. The interior was nice, a lot of chairs on the bar and you can see them grill the satay too. Quite nice for small group or even date night..wink..wink...  The spicy seafood hotpot, I  am not a fan of it. It feel like they just used chili oil paste, lots of oil. I got 1 small tiny half crab, which is barely got the meat of it. Couples shrimps with the head and the skin attached, kinda annoyed to eat it especially when it's hot..lol.  The spicy pork intestinal was awesome, if you dare to try. Again, a lots of chili oils but the flavors was great.   I would love to go back to try their sushi next time. The place is open till 2 am, which is awesome!   The services average."}
{"text":"I was weary about going here, i consider myself a connoisseur of hot pot, and i read peoples comments on IG posts, and they were not that great.  It reinforced my belief when i walked in and saw they had a sushi bar, a sushi bar at a Chinese hot pot place?  The decor was also Japanese which made me think it was a shabu shabu spot (which i do not like) but they had a Japanese BBQ grill which i wasn't mad at.  I ordered the spciy beef hotpot and she ordered the lamb, the lamb was not full of flavor but what it did have was richness, if you love lamb you don't usually want it overbearingly spicy in a soup. well, we don't at least (we had the cumin lamb as an appetizer for that) My hotpot on the other hand, was bursting with flavor, so much i ordered an extra side of enoki mushrooms to go with it, the spice level was perfect for a date (they told me i could get more spicy if i want next time)  and the best part was free ice cream at the end! we got the green tea, it wasn't that blah super sweet green tea you get from most sushi joints, it had a great base to it and finished off the meal perfectly."}
{"text":"This brings me back memories of Boiling Point in SoCal, the taste is almost identical! The whole time I was eating I was telling my fiance how much I LOVED it.  The service is kind of slow as they are pretty understaffed but the food overshadows that.  We got the spicy beef pot, seafood pot, and kimchi pot  Spicy Beef-  Pretty spicy for my taste, doesn't come with enough beef but fiance loved it.  Seafood pot- was my favorite comes with a lot of clams, shrimp, crab, and some pork.   Kimchi pot- comes with kim chi of course, hot dogs (asian hot pot staple, weird I know), and pork.    I am usually a beef lover but their pork cooks better than their beef does.    The takoyaki is not worth ordering... now this appetizer is normally crunchy on the outside and soft on the inside.  This one was just soft... flavors were there but texture fell flat.    We will be back every week!"}
{"text":"I've had my fair share of hot pot before, hell I worked at a shabu shabu restaurant in the past so it's safe to say I have pretty high standards when it comes to hot pot. Though I do acknowledge the differences when it comes down to it.  YZ's is a bit confusing, it has Taiwanese/Chinese style hotpot but sell Yakitori and show cases decor that is Japanese. I ordered the Spicy Beef Hot Pot with Ponzu sauce and a side of quail eggs.  The hot pot broth was indeed spicy, came with 50% cabbage, enoki mushrooms, 3 slices of beef, imitation crab, clear noodles, tofu. The side order of quail eggs was a joke, there was only 3 and were oddly hard and rubbery in texture. Other than spicy, the broth was bland. The ponzu sauce was overly garlicky and was spicy due to it's rawness and didn't accent the flavors of the hot pot. To be honest, the items in the hot pot didn't taste fresh and my flame went out 5 minutes into eating.  The service is spotty, had to waive down the waitresses a couple of times and didn't really recommend anything or mentioned what they served at YZ.   For $12, I left unsatisfied and they had included an automatic gratuity which had caused some confusion. Since they had an optional addition of tip below that auto gratuity, I'd rather decide if I'd like to tip a certain percentage or not.  Would skip on the hot pot here and probably order some skewers or other tapas instead."}
{"text":"I wasn't impressed. Ordered the garlic crab, and the crab was nothing like the picture on yelp---it was small and really hard to eat because there was not much meat.   We also ordered the spicy beef hot pot (medium) and it was way spicy. It was still good but towards the end it got a little hard to eat.   The tempura ice cream was not crispy/crunchy at all. It was more of a pound cake.   I'm willing to try this place again just because they have such a broad variety of their menu. Even though they claim to be Izakaya, it's more Chinese than Japanese food."}
{"text":"Checked out this place because I was already in the parking lot. Ordered my food to go and read three reviews about them cooking the food in front of you and long waits.  So I decided it would be a good time to hop off Yelp before I started interrogating the guy on why my food wasn't being cooked. Then the guy comes out with my food right as I closed my phone.  Food was good. Service was fast, but its rare for an Asian restaurant to get 5 stars from me, because every decent place is expensive. Overall, they have my stamp of approval though."}
{"text":"Here's a pleasingly different culinary offering for this area! I enjoyed jaw jacking  with the staff, too. Get your alcohol permit Hot Pot, because Pacific Asian beers go so good with this food!"}
{"text":"i'll be quick to admit that when it comes to Hot Pot: \"I have no idea what I'm doing\".  I got the spicy beef hot pot with medium level spicy (they also offer very hot & flaming levels of spice). Got it to go, the $11.99 price seemed fair for the size & variety of ingredients.   It's pretty much a spicy bowl of ramen with more ingredients than usual such as tofu, cabbage, meats, veggies.  And the spice was noticeable, wasnt bland at all.   I'll give this place another visit in the future."}
{"text":"The hot pot was beautifully presented and the broth is cooked to standards of many hotpot places that I have visited in Asia.  The meat was frozen and slice into very thin rolls which is how it was served back home.  The place is Chinese owned with Japanese flair.  The ingredients are very fresh and I certainly would hoped that they offer more green leaf vegetables for the sukiyaki.  For a place in Phoenix, this is a very nice unpolished gem that need to be discovered.  Go for their special tea (Yuzu-Pomelo Grapefruit), it is fabulous and I have not tasted something this good for years."}
{"text":"Dont get the seafood one. very salty. The other ones are pretty good. the beef one. The decor and the presentation was very well done."}
{"text":"This place was ok.  I ordered the Ramen here and was very disappointed.   I had the BBQ Oysters, they were fantastic.    I had the grilled jalopeno and eggplant both were great.    If I were to go back here, I would order from the BBQ menu."}
