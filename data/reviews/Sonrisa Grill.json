{"text":"Our first and our last time eating here. I had a \"Chile relleno\" the menu said light fluffy batter, I got a hard green chile in an omelet. It was NOT good at all! Our waiter was ridiculous.  We saw him 3x the entire time we were seated. I had to flag him down to get the bill. It's ashame, Lake Las Vegas is a beautiful place to visit.  Next time we'll just get some gelato and call it dinner!"}
{"text":"We go here all the time! Everything is always amazing and a great value for the price. We have been here all year round and they have tons of repeat business. Never had any issues on food or service.   I love how Frank W. keeps posting the same review at every website possible. After first reading, I at first thought that he is one of those people who never dine out, but are critics. Why did he think the guacamole would be free?? Did the staff say free or complimentary? I went ahead an read his other reviews. This guy needs to quit eating out. He has never had a meal that he liked. Everything is always bland, boring, over/undercooked. Please, Mr. & Mrs. Westie, stop buying the gift certificates from third parties and STAY HOME. We don't need any more negativity in the world, since you are NEVER pleased with anything."}
{"text":"Awesome- place is great- feels like Cabo the drinks and food are also great and priced well"}
{"text":"I have recently moved out to Lake Las Vegas from Henderson and one of the features I enjoyed was the laid back nature of the community, and the restaurants in the village. I have brought my dog(s) several times to sit on the patios and enjoy the atmosphere. On Sunday my girlfriend and I tried to enjoy a beautiful afternoon on the patio at Sonrisa Grill with our small dogs, enjoying margaritas and mimosas, only to be told that dogs are no longer allowed on their patio. We were disappointed and headed to the Auld Dubliner pub where they were more than happy to accommodate us and our dogs. We ended up having a very nice afternoon.   Previous visits to Sonrisa Grill have been pleasant enough, with the food being the main selling feature as the service is always slow. A point of reference is on Friday night we had a great dinner at Luna Rosa in the village, where our dogs were able to join us."}
{"text":"I am so disappointed in Sonrisa. It used to be my boyfriend's favorite restaurant. I've been here before, and my food was awesome. I remember wondering why our table was only one of 3 in the entire restaurant. I think I now have my answer.   For New Year's Eve, my boyfriend and I wanted to come out to Lake Las Vegas. Sunset and Vines didn't have any reservations available, so on Sunday night we tried calling Sonrisa. No answer. We left a message. No response. After several more attempts, someone at Sonrisa picked up the phone, and replied that they were completely booked for 7pm, but were wide open for any other time. That should have been my first clue.   Next I went on their website to see if they had any special entertainment happening, or if they had a special menu. I quickly found that they did have a holiday menu and entertainment listed for New Years....2010. Again, this should have been a red flag.   So New Year's Eve, we get to the restaurant, and are seated right away. There is a little band in the corner, and the place is pretty busy, so that seemed promising. The waiter hands us our menus, and informs me that they aren't serving the regular menu, only the holiday menu. I thought that was a little weird, since it is busy, but not exactly line out the door busy, but whatever. I take a look at the New Year's Eve menu, and it's basically 6 entrees pulled from their normal menu, with a choice of soup or salad, and a \"chef's choice\" of desert. Priced at $50 a person. Not exactly a special menu, but at this point I was hungry, and as I said before, the last time I had been there, the food was really good.   I ordered the fillet mignon and my boyfriend ordered the lobster tail. When my medium steak came out, it was completely chard and had the faintest shade of pink to it. The waiter apologized and said he would bring me another steak. The second one came out raw. Again, the waiter took one look at it, apologized, and offered to bring me a third. By this time, I also began to notice that the potatoes were dry and had a crust on them like they had been scraped out of the bottom of the pan. My boyfriend's white rice was really mushy, and it suddenly struck us both as an odd thing to put white rice with a lobster tail, and not put anything else on the plate.   Finally, my third steak came out, and it was cooked fine, but it was kind of spongy, and really difficult to cut into. Instead of cutting clean, the fibers in the meat wouldn't cut, and I realized that all of their meat had probably been in a freezer for a very long time. At this point, it became obvious that the entire menu was made up of whatever they needed to use up in their freezer. We asked for the manager, who was very nice, apologetic, and he did comp our bill. Except that my boyfriend recognized him as a waiter he had had before, and I am pretty sure that there is no real manager at Sonrisa, and this poor waiter had just stepped up to take the heat of all of the customer complaints.   The last straw was the \"desert\" that came out. It was plain tortilla chips covered in whipped cream and Hershey syrup. It looked like something a five year-old would make for desert, and proudly announce they made it themselves.   I feel really sorry for the wait staff at Sonrisa, as I have never had any problems with the staff, and who seem to be trying to do a good job.  It is painfully obvious that whoever owns or operates this business just doesn't give a crap about it, or have any pride in their food. The restaurant has such great potential, and it almost seems like the owners are just trying to cut their losses by selling as much old food as possible before they decide to just shut down."}
{"text":"I have eaten here in the pass and I recently went back and the food was very fresh. The menu was the same but with better ingredients.  The soup was absolutely amazing we had to order a second bowl. Ivan made a wonderful mojoito and Marcus was an excellent server. I will definitely be back! !! All the food was so good. Love it love it"}
{"text":"We come here regularly... Food and drinks are always great. Everything we try on the menu is always top notch!"}
{"text":"I thought the food and service were excellent. A little pricy on the regular menu,  but they have good happy hour deals and specials."}
{"text":"Great outdoor atmosphere! The food is excellent, always fresh and good portions. It's a little pricey for Mexican food, but so is everything in Lake Las Vegas.Service is  very friendly and welcoming, UNLIKE all of the other Lake Las Vegas restaurants."}
{"text":"Really good Mexican food and service is great. Prices are also very reasonable. The chile relleno was amazing!!"}
{"text":"Great attentive bar staff and waiters. Drinks are quality and made from scratch: Cadillac margarita with grand Marnier and fresh lime juice. Very polite. Fresh food, this place is underated. Love it."}
{"text":"Lake Las Vegas is a ghost town!   Either way, we were anxious to use our Groupon and try out a new Mexican joint.  We walked in and there were only a handful of people, everyone looked lost.  No one greeted us, we had to walk around until we found anyone working there.  It was just the bartender.   He was very nice and seemed overwhelmed, even-though he only had two patrons at the bar and two tables in the restaurant area.  He was the only person working.    The food was disgusting!  We had the sampler so we could try out the place's signature plates; but it tasted like microwave food.  The wings were re-heated and the food left an icky taste in my mouth.  This place could have some potential but they have fallen into the death circle of Lake Las Vegas.  Its no place to visit.  Save your gas money and stay in town.    How disappointing.  The bartender was super nice and trying, but the food was just plain gross and his margaritas made in a rush."}
{"text":"Sopa de Albondigas soup is the best Mexican soup I have ever had, and I make it my business to try soups from all over the US. It is ranked up there with all-time favorites, reserving top spot for my mother's ham & bean soup."}
{"text":"The food is consistently good. Have had dinner twice so far, ordering different items each time. Good flavor, cooked well, and on Sunday's there is wonderful Sangria to drink as they have \"Sangria Sunday\" with a lower price on the Sangria.  I highly recommend eating here while visiting Lake Las Vegas.."}
{"text":"Seated immediately. Pina colada was amazing! Well balanced. Chips with queso were incredible. Addicting queso sauce. Wanted to put it on everything. Had to remind the waiter a few times for drink refills and requests. Ordered the Southwestern chicken salad which was fresh and had a good amount of chicken. Chipotle dressing was very good. Comes in a large edible shell. Didn't feel heavy at all though. Toward the end of the meal it got really hot inside. I was sweating and needed to leave ASAP. Not a great quality in a Vegas area restaurant. Would definitely come back for taco Tuesday, which is ALL YOU CAN EAT!"}
{"text":"This was our first time trying it. Have to say that we were disappointed with the food. Chips and salsa were probably the best part of our dinner. We ordered the chef special chipotle enchilada and burrito and chicken quesadilla for our son. It's probably the blandest food I've ever had. Chicken had no flavor. Seemed boiled and shredded chicken wrapped in tortilla and smothered w chipotle sauce. Even the quesadilla was bland. Would not recommend this place to anyone. Stay away. Staff is cordial but food was horrible."}
{"text":"Great food and super friendly staff! We had a large group and they accommodated us all so well."}
{"text":"This place is slow. It took us 30 min to find someone to ask to be sat down. A random person not even dressed in work clothes eventually sat us out of pity. When we got in, we waited 20 min for water after ordering. It is hard to justify coming back even though we live so close. They're not efficient or effective and don't seem to really care."}
{"text":"ivan the great bartender/manager rawks awesomeness!!   He is fast and makes greaT drinks!!"}
{"text":"Had a good time here. You get chips and salsa to start, although not as spicy as I like they were both good. The crane Asada chimichanga was legit! The drinks were well made and the service was excellent.  Salt and pepper were on every table when we walked in. If I'm ever in the area again, I'll surely be going back!"}
{"text":"The server was wonderful and attentive but the food wasn't so good. Ordered the vegetarian fajitas, and the seasoning was lacking to say the least. The only good thing was the chips and salsa were delicious but the salsa holder was so small the waiter had to bring two for each basket of chips."}
{"text":"They told us the wait is 20 minutes it's now has been an hour and 15 minutes and we still hadn't been seated.... This is a Mexican restaurant with no horchatha!"}
{"text":"I am so glad we tried this place this weekend. Several of my friends reccommended Sonrisa, so we finally checked it out!   The menu takes a progressive twist on Mexican food. The best way to describe it would be San Diego Mexican. There are many seafood dishes listed in addition to the more traditional fare like enchiladas, quesadillas, chimichangas, etc. They also have stuff that is vegetarian and vegan friendly.    We started with the guacamole and spinach queso (labeled as cheese sauce on the menu). Both apps were great.   We ordered the tortilla soup for our next course, followed by the combo dish that allows you to try a little bit of everything. We selected the chile relleno, beef enchilada, and tamale. Everything was great, but the beef enchilada was fantastic. Sonrisa seasoned the enchilada with a variation of a mole sauce. I was pleasantly surprised by my first bite of the enchilada...and kept going until there was nothing left! Yum!  I should not neglect all the other fun things they had going on while we were there. We went on a Friday night and they had a full-on karoake jam session going on, they call it Jamioke. You can get up and sing, but  they also have some great singers in the band. I was intrigued to see a drum set that different customers started banging on, as well. Why not, right?  Last but not least, their tasty libations made the night complete. The beverage list was great. I partook of the house margarita(s) (on the rocks). If you look on the website they host a special each night ranging from sangria Sunday to margarita Mondays.   The service was fantastic and friendly. I will definitely make sure to hit this place up again!"}
{"text":"My husband and I on our vacation was told that Sonrisa Grill had a new and creative chef. We wanted to try his special menu items.  The new menu items was not available yet. Our server, Daniel went one step beyond and introduced us to the new \"Chef Rafael\".   Chef Rafael graciously prepared a special meal tasting from an appetizer of tuna tartar on a bed of guacamole served with fried taro root chips,. Next was the salad of mixed greens and fruit with a passion fruit dressing. Followed by a Chinga tostada and to end a delicious meal, fried ice cream with a berry sauce.  The food was outstanding. The dishes that Chef Rafael prepared was light and refreshing. A great new twist to Mexican food!  We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Nice atmosphere very chill. Stopped here out of the blue. I was at Lake Las Vegas to check out a different place (Brooklyn something) but they where closed at 3pm on 3/16/15.   I only had drinks at the bar and free chips and salsa. I ordered a house margarita, it was good but they did use a sour of the soda gun. It would be nice to see some fresh juices used.  If I was in the mood for Mexican food I would come back. I do live close to here so that said I don't see people from the west side of town making the trip."}
{"text":"A friend of mine recommended this place when he found out I'd be traveling to the Henderson area. Imagine my surprise when the restaurant was conveniently right in the village resort where I was staying. I was able to walk a few feet from the hotel and I am there. I conveniently went there on taco Tuesday. It wasn't crowded at all. I noticed that the indoor dining room can only hold 71 people. This makes for a cozy dining experience if it were filled to capacity. No worries, there is also outdoor dining with a view of Lake Las Vegas if it gets too crowded indoors . Although this location works well for couples, l was very comfortable dining alone. The food was adequate in that I have eaten much better Mexican food elsewhere. However, Sonrisa certainly satisfies the craving.They also added a touch of class by having a live guitarist perform.  I will certainly eat here again."}
{"text":"This place had amazing service and the food was absolutely delicious. We were here attending a wedding and found this place to grab a quick bite. I would recommend coming here even if it met you would need to drive in from the strip. Totally worth it."}
{"text":"Chevys in the mall is better than this place. Food was mediocre at best. They charged $.75 for some hot sauce that at least gave some kind of flavor to the food. $85 for dinner for two with two margaritas and an appetizer. Better off eating somewhere else for that price.  Waitress was more interested in BS ing with the folks at another table than taking care of us. Very disappointed. No wonder lake Las Vegas is a ghost town!"}
{"text":"The food was OK - but not wonderful.  The appetizers were all very good (we especially loved the avocado rolls, queso, and calamari).  The entrees were so-so.  Not overly unique, and OK - just not wonderful.  Service (for such an empty house) was pretty lack-luster."}
{"text":"Great service and staff. Super friendly and totally understand customer service. Taco Tuesday is a great deal and meal."}
{"text":"Awesome drinks and top quality service from Marcus the server and Ivan the bartender, outstanding!  Food is fresh and delivered on time, drinks are on par. Will be back to visit."}
{"text":"If I could give this restaurant no stars, I would. The food was good and our waiter was great! But the general manager and owner herself need some manners and class. It all started with my daughters quinceanera photoshoot. After photoshoot we went to the restaurants patio to eat and have drinks...it was hot. We had my daughters big dress and the petty coat with us plus all the camera equipment. It was 8:30pm on a Wednesday. The only customers outside were us and this other table of two people. We placed the dress and petty coat on a small table by the entrance which looked like decoration not an actual eating table. After an hour of us being there the general manager comes out and asked if that was a skirt on an eating table? In a very sarcastic rude way. My friend and I were in the middle of a deep conversation and we were just shocked in the manner in which he asked. So we said yes...and he said if you could put it on a chair instead. Again, he was extremely rude. I went inside and asked him if I could have the owners email cuz I need it to contact them and let them know how rude he was. All he needed to do is ask in a different way and be aware of a conversation that is happening that you should not interrupt. I get it...you are trying for your business to look nice. We were hot and no one was there and we threw our stuff somewhere where you can see it. Owner comes out and asked if there was a problem with the skirt? Right away I knew she was just as rude as he was. So I said no there no problem with the \"skirt\" but there's a problem with you manager. She said I was being disrespectful to her business and if one of her employees would put their ass on a table she would be upset with them too, in those exact words! She told me I wasn't a business owner which I'm not sure how she would know who I am....I'm not a business owner but I'm part of a business that strives on customer service. I told her I heard enough and just wanted check. She came back with check and asked if she could say something else and I said no. Asked if she could say something to my kids and I said no, then asked that if the manager would've said what he said in Spanish, if it would've made a difference? I'm of Hispanic decent. I could not believe she even asked that?? I know we did not think of the restaurant esthetics. I told her...I know why you don't want the \"skirt\" there....I get it, but it's not what you say it's how you say it and she could not comprehend that. Instead went on a classless rant. Please give your money to any other business owner!!"}
{"text":"Came here on valentines day, the place was packed. The server warned us that the kitchen was backed up. We didn't mind waiting, but it did take at least an hour from the time we ordered till we got our food. They were good about refilling drinks and offering up additional chips/salsa.  We had the steak/shrimp fajitas and the ribeye steak. This was my first visit and I'm still wondering about the menu. They gave us two menus, one was a valentines day menu, looked like it might have been prix fixe, but the menu didn't indicate that. The other (regular?) menu we ordered off was pretty small, probably 15 items total. A lot of \"typical\" choices were missing. I don't recall seeing any tacos, I think there was one enchilada and that was a spicy shrimp only? Where's the enchilada with choice of meat or cheese? Where's taco with choice of meat? Menu options were lacking to say the least, I'm seriously wondering if they forgot to give us one of the menus?  When the food arrived it was meh. The fajitas were not seasoned much, hardly any flavor. No guac or sour cream on the side with the fajitas. The ribeye steak was fatty and mashed potatoes were instant.  The food didn't remotely compare to even Outback or Chilis and it was more expensive.  Overall I thought service was good, but the service couldn't make up for the poor quality food.  I'd really wanted this place to be a place I'd come back to since I live nearby, but I don't see that happening."}
{"text":"This place must be good to survive in Lake Las Vega - Ivan was an excellent server and the food was above average ... Happy hour was a good value ($3 drafts) .... Not quite worth the drive from Red Rock but if you find yourself here it's a solid choice."}
{"text":"What a bad ending to what was a great night.  We sat relatively quickly.  We ordered a pitcher and 2 orders of guacamole.  Water came quick.  Drinks about 15 minutes, guacamole OVER 45 MINUTES.   The guac was served in little ramekins, usually used for a side of horseradish.  They must be f***ing kidding.  We had finished the pitcher and and the waiter had not been back to take the order.  I had to go to the hostess to find him.  7 minutes later, he shows up and tells us theyre working on our guac.    Now its an hour and 40 minutes and we have no sign of entrees.  I ask to speak to tje general manager.  Three different people told me she was three different places.  Im in the business and was polite but firm.  She obviously wasnt the GM and honestly, not a experienced manager. I know she was not in charge just maybe for the day.   There was an wine walk event there that night that had a ton of folks.  They werent prepared.  Whoever is really in charge, not sure whether its corporate or not, needed to be there or get called in,   They failed.   They had a line at the door and they had empty tables.  I told her the guacamole was embarrassing and didnt even realize they charged us $12.   Guardinos smokes this and much much less.    After three baskets of chips, and just a frustrating end to what was a great night, I didnt care about the meal.   It comes and the tacos were greasy.  The lobster on top of the paella was 2 overcooked. 1 1/2 inch lobster tails that could be snapped in half.  The soup was ok, although served 4 minutes after all other dishes and no one else thought their meal was average.  A well run restaurant would have known there was an issue and tried to minimize further disaster.  Acknowledge the guests, treat them with respect.  She did get us a round of low end tequila shots (I know my tequila) and when some other lady brought them over, she tries to tell me that life is short and to try and enjoy it.  Really?  Guess she missed the customer service classes.    Nice of them to also add a 18% gratuity.  This place really lets me feel glad that I dont make an effort to come to Lake Las Vegas."}
{"text":"Thought we would join friends staying at Lake LasVegas for dinner at Sonrisa. Margarita pitcher was over-priced at $40! Chips and salsa were average. Entrees of tacos, enchiladas and burritos were below average. Next time we'll bring friends into Vegas for Mexican food. Very disappointing."}
{"text":"What a nice surprise!!!! Our meal started with chips and salsa that was perfect! We shared the combination #3. Big portion and perfect for sharing. The cjhile relleno was perfect! we enjoyed our meal on a nice patio with misters and listened to live music. The view from the pation of the lake is very pleasant. Our server wass nic"}
{"text":"We had shrimp fajit and a southwestern salad.  They fajita were ok, but I know several other restaurants in town where they do a nice dish for 15-18 bucks.  I was expecting more for their $25.  They were missing something and do not have robust flavor.  There southwest salad had a similAR problem and then chicken had a decent char but was dry.  Again I can get muchim better salads arround town at at least fI've places and this was overpriced and lacked flavor"}
{"text":"My husband and I enjoyed dinner at Sonrisa Grill. We stayed at the Ravella midweek in June and many of the restaurants in the Village were closed. I read the negative reviews on service on Yelp, but we decided to take a chance. The service was good and the food was delicious. Being from San Diego, we have our share of excellent Mexican Restaurants but Sonrisa offered some new and different flavors and menu choices. The tortilla soup was rich and smokey - unlike any I've had before. You must try the ribs! The ribs were so delicious - dressed in a thick, smokey sauce with a bit of a kick, and served with the a mango salsa. I'd never thought to pair mango and ribs together but it was so delicious. I tried to get the rib recipe from the waitress, but she wouldn't reveal the \"secret spices\". The margaritas were tasty too. Not too sweet and served in a larger glass than usual. Would definitely return on our next visit."}
{"text":"There were only two things that might bring me back for a margarita on the patio. The server was very nice, quick and professional, and the location is beautiful. The food on the other hand was not very good. The chile relleno was a frozen product. The albondiga soup, tomatillo sauce and red enchilada sauces were salty. The guacamole was a bagged product. My wife had the paella which was pretty good, but not worth the price. It is a shame that such a beautiful restaurant does not have a scratch kitchen, there is plenty of potential."}
{"text":"Really enjoyed the atmosphere.   We sat on the patio and listened to a wonderful guitar player. The blue Patron Margarita is incredible!"}
{"text":"I went here for a meet and greet night for our class reunion.  Unbelievable service! Great food and the atmosphere was great! Thank you for the great accommodation!"}
{"text":"Great Mexican food.  Had an early dinner here on Saturday. Large variety of dishes to choose from and we ultiimately decided on nachos with chicken, beef fajitas and combo #3 with cheese enchiladas and crispy shredded beef tacos. All the food was delicious.   We're from San Antonio and its always a struggle to find good tex-mex food outside of TX.  Our favorite dish  was the nachos. Covered in a white cream sauce and refried beans that were delicious and served nice and hot. They also have a habanero salsa available upon request 3.5/5 heat level. Cheese enchiladas were almost as good as they are inTX. Being from SA we prefer our crispy beef tacos with ground beef but only shredded available here.  Shells were crispy and beef was seasoned perfectly.  And....I never thought I'd say this....there was almost too much meet in the tacos.   The beef fajitas were the most disappointing. Would give them a 3/5 for taste.   Overall the majority of the dishes we had were fantastic and the service was excellent.   Highly recommend!!"}
{"text":"Very good food, a bit pricey but it is to be expected in a remote location, since you save gas money. The serving size is large so make sure you are hungry enough to eat the whole platter. Overall not a bad place to eat."}
{"text":"Sonrisa Grill for many of the locals here in Lake Las Vegas, such as myself, has become a second home.  The staff is great at making you feel like family or there most important customer.  I have met a lot of my neighbors here, as well as a few perspective ones.  If you like Tequila, this is the place to be, with the largest selection I have seen in the US outside of Southern California.  But wait, what about the food?  Sonrisa Grill has an eclectic mix of Mexican/Latin American Cuisine including steak and seafood, with there shrimp and fajita dishes be the most popular. But come hungry because you have to start with one of there amazing appetizers like avocado rolls or calamari.   There salsa, which is made fresh everyday, is one of the best I have had and I lived in So. California for 38 years. I get an order of cheese dip with the salsa. This goes great with Dos Equis Amber.  In the Spring and Summer I would recommend reservation because this place is always full in the evenings with the patio tables being in high demand with there view of the Lake and entertainment. I sit at the bar and observe the shocked faces of people coming in and are told the wait is 45 mins. It is common for people to think they can get a table easy because they see the rest of The Village being slow. It is quite entertaining to see a stuck up South Shore resident get told they will have to wait.  Friday and Saturday they usually have entertainment.  It is usually a Karaoke band or a Jazz duet.  They have a lot of private parties there as well with special menu items and I always here people raving about the food. You can buy out the restaurant for the evening if you have a big party such as a wedding rehearsal dinner or special event . This happens quite a bit with Sonrisa Grill being next to the Ritz Carlton and from what I have heard the prices are very reasonable for this."}
{"text":"I had family visiting from Az that were staying at the Westin Lake Las Vegas after deciding to do the wine walk Sonrisa Grill was recommend to us by one of the staff that worked in the casino.  When we got to the restaurant we were seated after only a few minutes of waiting, once we sat our waiter promptly greeted us and took our drink order. Shortly thereafter he returned and took our food order, my sister and I ordered the Shrimp a la Diablo we were told it was spicy, upon getting our entrees I took a bite of one of the shrimp and \"HOLY CRAP\" that stuff was HOT!!   My sister did fine with hers but I could not bear the hotness, I'm talking burning your ears hot! So I called the waiter over and told him that I couldn't eat the dish and that I would like to order another entree upon returning to our table he leaves a DRINK menu. It took about 10 minutes for someone to return to our table with a full menu, but it wasn't our server it was a waitress and as she approached our table she had the menu open and before I could say a word she said \"YOU ORDERED THE SHRIMP A LA DIABLO IT'S SPICY\" I replied that it was too hot for me and I would like to order something else she replied with \" THAT'S FINE BUT I STILL HAVE TO CHARGE YOU FOR THE ENTREE, DO YOU WANT ME TO PUT IT IN A BOX FOR YOU???? WTF?????  I was so irritated and hungry at this point we said fine I placed a new food order, but by this time the other three people I was with had already finished their meals, the waitress says to me \"IT'LL BE ABOUT FIVE MINUTES, BUT ABOUT 20 MINUTES LATER MY FOOD FINALLY CAME AND IT ARRIVED IN A TO GO BOX!! Which further annoyed me.  So here I sit eating dinner with three other diners that were all waiting for me to finish my meal which was being eaten out of a to go box and plastic ware. The waiter comes back and says \"OH I MESSED UP THAT WAS A TO GO ORDER, BUT I'LL HAVE YOUR PLATE OUT IN A FEW MINUTES AND AS HE WALKED AWAY HE SAYS, IM BLONDE...WHAT DO YOU EXPECT?!? Again...WTF???  By this time our whole party was over this dining experience, we ended up waiting for about another 15 minutes to get the check despite the fact that our waiter and the waitress who had taken my second order had walked by several times.   I may have considered returning to this restaurant despite their terrible service because of the mango margaritas, BUT DUE TO THE FACT THAT THEY MADE ME PAY FOR ANOTHER ENTREE after tasting my dish and it being too hot I will never return nor recommend, in fact I will DISSUADE anyone from dining here."}
{"text":"Horrible. I ordered the ceviche and the first bite I had pubic hair in it. And they didn't even comp my bill. Fucking  disgusting"}
{"text":"Nice, fun place. Live Entertainment on Tuesday nights the band is great. And Steven our waiter is attentive and awesome!"}
{"text":"Chris our waiter was very pleasant and attentive. The Pico de Gallo was Excellent. Definitely the best thing we had on our visit. My husband has a combo that he said was just ok. His mojito was just ok. The fajitas were average. I would rate it higher but the rice and beans did not taste restaurant quality. The homemade guacamole was good. Could use a little spice. Overall, I may give it one more try to see maybe it  was an off night for the chef."}
{"text":"Worst Mexican food ever.  It started with the salsa.  I thought it had a strange flavor, but didn't want to say anything, thinking I needed to give the place a chance.  Then it went downhill.  The chicken in my enchilada tasted like it came from a can.  The cheese tasted like imitation.  The chili relleno coating was just plain weird, like doughy or something.  I was shocked.  Too bad, such a beautiful location, I was so disappointed.  We asked for sour cream and didn't realize we had asked a busboy.  All he had to do was go tell our waiter that we wanted something, but instead he ignored us, since he didn't understand English.   The entrance was hard to find.  There was a sign that said to use the front entrance.  When we couldn't find it, we went in the way that seemed logical and we were ignored.   I honestly can't believe some of the reviewers are saying the food was good.  This is the only reason I signed on to write this review.  This place seriously does not know Mexican food."}
{"text":"Taco Tuesday here is great. They had live music and the food and service was stellar. Will definitely be back."}
{"text":"I love this place. One of the nicest restaurants if you like to sit outside. The staff is friendly and food and the drinks are good."}
{"text":"We were heading for an Irish pub that was closed, ended up here and I'm glad we did. Great live music for ambience, attentive staff and very reasonable pricing. I am glad we found it with so much time left in the week. Marcus was our server and took great care of us... We will be back..."}
{"text":"Excellent. Great food, and the lower section - the bar- opens to the outside and, except when 100+ degrees, is almost always open. Faces the Village entertainment (Friday nights). Even in cool weather can sit outside by the fireplaces and enjoy the view of the lake. Worth the drive from the strip. Am a local; have visited often for more than 2 years and have never had anything other than a great meal with great, personal service, and returning guests always ask to go back. Will take pics next time."}
{"text":"I recently had to plan a conference at LLV.  We chose to do a taco night for a group of the attendees.  We ended up with 40 people and I think everything turned out very well.  We arranged a meal of tacos, rice, beans, salad, and sodas for the group.  We also got the drink specials for everyone.  Chanthy, the owner, had the food out at EXACTLY 7pm as promised.  Everything was hot & fresh.  The restaurant had to make last minute changes to our area due to rain and it still didn't affect them.  I was very happy with everything I am sorry to see the other comments on here.  I would go back for sure."}
{"text":"The service was excellent, although it's first come first served, you can't put your name on a list, you just line up and they seat you when a table opens that happens to be big enough. The waitstaff and speed were great. The food was average or below average - the cheese dip tasted like (and felt like) it was made out of velveeta. Disappointing and I'm pretty sure the hotel staff only recommend it because it's that or the snooty Italian restaurant or drive back into Henderson for something else."}
{"text":"My friends and I strolled into this restaurant because the patio seemed to be the only happening spot in the entire village.  There was a man playing live music inside which could be heard outside, it was the perfect setting for a relaxing evening.   I ordered a carne asada burrito.  My carne asada was a generous portion served with a side of beans and rice.  The carne seemed more like ground beef and the taste was a little bland.  My boyfriend ordered the chimichanga and was also \"just so\" with his choice.  The general consensus from everyone around the table was that the food was not horrible but definitely not something to write home about.  From the 6 dishes we ordered, it seems as if the chicken fajitas were the best choice.  The margaritas were watered down and the other alcoholic drinks weren't very strong, especially for the price that was paid.  Definitely don't go in expecting to get your buzz on, unless of course you order straight shots, then maybe you can be on a good one.    Our waiter Omar was really nice, he gets 5 stars if I could just rate on staff alone.  But this is for overall experience.  Next time I am in town, I will probably skip this place and will try something else out, or maybe I would stop in for a shot of tequila, but otherwise, I'd skip the food!"}
{"text":"Health Hazard! All the time we spent eating lunch was also spent chasing flies off the table. Also, please note the ff: Poor service - no napkins given till we asked for it Tamales - so dry my companion did not eat hers after the first bite Carne Asada Fries - where is the carne -- hardly noticed it as it was all  mostly fries Calamares - so soggy, not crunchy - must have been reheated on the microwave Pricey for the quality of food they serve."}
{"text":"This is my favourite restaurant ! It is a great combination of great food great service and beautiful atmosphere! A hidden gem!"}
{"text":"Stayed in one of the hotels at Lake Las Vegas 2 weekends in a row, both times with our young grandsons. This is an excellent Mexican restaurant. The food is incredible. The wait staff are fun and do a great job. Our grandsons made sure we had lunch and dinner here one day. We, of course returned the following weekend for dinner."}
{"text":"Food is ok the service was good but I will definitely not come back here.... Vegas has too many great restaurants this place is not worth your money!"}
{"text":"The first time I ate at this place was during  a concert that was going on lake side. The restaurant was very busy. I am in the service industry and it was apparent to me that this restaurant is not used to having high volume. It took a long time to get acknowledged after joining my friends table who had already been there. The server I had was terrible and a messed up my drink order. Service was very slow. I was reluctant to go back to this place but was talked into it by a friend. I'll have to say my last visit was much better. The food and drinks were good and service was good too. I guess my best advice is to check this place out if you're ever at Lake Las Vegas but maybe not during events."}
{"text":"The only reason I am not giving this place 2 stars is because the staff & atmosphere were great. The food ssuucckss. Okay, maybe not totally- but for the price, I expected much better!! Good thing the Music bingo was super fun!!"}
{"text":"Best Mexican food in town!! The drinks are amazing and Omar is the BEST bartender EVER!! The avocado rolls are my fav appetizer along with the ribs for dinner....the meat falls right off the bone!! This is the perfect hang out spot to kick it at the bar and chill or romantic evening out on the patio with fire pit and live music."}
{"text":"Definitely the best Mexican food I've had in Las Vegas or Henderson. Great view, indoor and outdoor seating. Awesome and rare Tequila variety"}
{"text":"Great food! Great service! Try the chimichangas! Salsa is great!!"}
{"text":"We were very happy with the chips and salsa, very good! The food was bland and only warm, nor hot. Service was really slow but our waiter was kind. We feel badly for the businesses at Lake Las Vegas b/c it is so slow out there. Hoping the town will eventually grow enough to meet up with them."}
{"text":"Great place to seat by the lake and have a drink(margaritas). The complementary chips &salsa is so good! Good food and margaritas, nice and friendly service from everyone, even the manager came and check on us! Oh and the have live guitar music which goes well with the already mellow atmosphere!"}
{"text":"Always a great experience. I've been eating at Sonrisa for years and the staff are the best, food is great, and the live music really sets the mood. We need more restaurants that take pride in their products and services and Sonrisa is a great example to follow."}
{"text":"Had dinner last night and give them a 3. Margarita was great and service was good, We ordered the mix fajitas steak and chicken and halibut tacos. The only probEm is they are very scimpy on the amount of protein they serve in their dish. Fajitas had 5 chunks of chicken and 3 small stripes of meat for $21. Lots of veggies of course to make it look like a lot. The halibut must have been a small catch today also, 4 small quarter size chunks in each one for  $18. Very generous on the extras if that's what you go for. If I return it won't be for those items. Beware, they ask if you want sour cream but don't tell you it's an charge."}
{"text":"There aren't a lot of places to eat at Lake Las Vegas so dinner was decided based on what was open. My boyfriend and I haven't had Mexican food in a while so during our stay at Westin Lake Las Vegas, we chose to eat at Sonrisa Grill. Heads up, the whole plaza where it's located is deserted! It was pretty creepy to park in an almost empty parking garage and walk through dark alleys and closed establishments. Since I watch too much Law & Order: SVU, I'm pretty paranoid when it comes to dark, desolate places. Anyway, we were pretty lost so we tried to listen for loud music or people laughing/talking just to find this place.   We saw bright lights and people drinking margaritas and Coronas at the patio so I knew we finally arrived-- Hallelujah! A host helped us find a table outside right away but it took a while for a server to notice us. We didn't mind though because we needed more time to look over the menu anyway. When the server finally came, we checked in on Yelp, showed her our phones and ordered the free house margaritas. She came back with the drinks, took our dinner orders and another server brought us free (first round only) chips & salsa and waters.  Food came out pretty fast. I ordered the Shredded Beef Chimichanga and it came with beans, rice, lettuce, guacamole and sour cream. My boyfriend ordered the Carne Asada Burrito and it came with beans and rice. Both dishes were super delicious and we loved pairing them with the chips and margaritas.   Now here's why I rate this place 3 stars: First off, there were no utensils given until I flagged someone down and asked. Not a big deal, of course, but still an unnecessary flaw. Then my boyfriend had a question about a certain dish. The server, unsure of what to say, grabbed his menu and just read the description to him. He didn't need help reading it.. he just needed more info about it. She called another server and he then explained the food to us in detail. Maybe she was new so we let it slide.   Then, 20 or so minutes into our meal, she told us that since she didn't tell the bartender about the Yelp check-in special and he prepared us bigger versions of what was supposed to be given, she had to charge us $16 for the two margaritas. Ummmm, how about NO WAY! We showed you our Yelp app on our phone & you clicked 'Use it Now!' on the redeem offer page. It's not our fault you ordered the wrong drinks to the bartender. We told her we were not going to pay for the drinks and wanted to speak to her manager. She came back a few minutes later, apologized and said her manager is taking them off our bill. Well, yeah obviously, that's only proper!   Final thoughts-- the food was good but the lackluster service was quite disappointing. Always bring utensils to your guests, have all servers know the menu items and don't put deals on any social media if not all servers are aware of it."}
{"text":"Went here on vacation. A good area to stay if you want to get out off downtown. We went to this restaurant for dinner the first night and never went back. After waiting for 30 minutes walked out. Staff was on phone and cared less."}
{"text":"Excellent service from the moment we walked in. Salsa & warm chips appeared almost instantly. Staff were uniformly polite and upbeat.   The warm chips took me aback a smidge at how different and irresistible they were.   My appetizer (avocado & bacon wrap) was just the right warmth and tastiness.  The chili rellenos main dish was more doughy,  less chili than I've had elsewhere, maybe not the highlight of my meal, but still delicious. I ate it all up.  My vegetarian wife commented on how vegetarian burritos are often filled only with lettuce and onions, whereas her's was filled with a cornucopia of seasoned vegetables. This pleased her.   She would definitely come back, and so would I."}
{"text":"Sitting in the restaurant now, I will say I won't be coming back. Moving here to LLV from Orange County, CA, so I have obviously eaten a time or two at Mexican restaurants. This place instantly confronts you with unfriendliness from the first sign you see when walking in the restaurant that says \"NO SPLIT CHECKS \".  Why?  BFD if they have to give multiple checks to multiple couples. Next, on a holiday weekend on a Friday night, both bathrooms are closed for cleaning at 7:30 pm. Really?  Men's and women's?  How dirty did they both get in the few last few hours. When we finally were allowed in to use them, well, what the hell. Could hardly rinse our hands with no water pressure. Then we ordered fajitas, and you need to pay 75¢ extra for sour cream and $3 extra for guacamole?? At $19 for chicken fajitas, I hate being \"nickeled and dimed\" to death for stuff that 90% of other Mexican restaurant include with the meal - at $15 or so. Let's not get into the fact that EVERY restaurant in this village AND including the beautiful Hilton Hotel, allow dogs on the patio outside while dining. Not this \"fine establishment\" though. What the hell?? This whole area, including both the hotels (Westin & Hyatt) are dog friendly. But not this place. This is like the second Yelp I have ever written. Over priced for what it is. Even the draft beer was two fingers short of the top of the glass. Wanted to sit outside, but while the French and Italian restaurants adjacent to this place have multiple heaters for the cold nights, this place has two on the entire outdoor area. The waitress could care less about my comments. So enough said."}
{"text":"We came for lunch.  We split a combination chicken and steak fajita plate.  It was really good and plenty of food for the two of us!  The salsa was good, but if you want more than one bowl they will charge you, per the menu.  We made due with one.  We would come back!"}
{"text":"Food was good. Not as good as good Cali Mexican Food. The margarita was good, Server could have been more attentive, maybe because he knew he already had secured the tip as we were a large party and gratuity was automatic. Had to ask for chip refills, salsa water etc."}
{"text":"The food here is exquisite, I had the blackened salmon witch looked fantastic. The service here was fast and got seated almost immediately. All in all it is a petite establishment but strikingly colorful the moment you get in. It is clear that I will be returning soon."}
{"text":"I drove out to Montelago Villiage for the day with a friend this week, and I really had high hopes. I also decided to stop in Sonrisa since it was the busiest place there. There was absolutely nobody in the restaurant and about 15 patrons on the patio. My friend and I sat at the bar.   We ordered happy hour drinks, mine was a margarita. I then checked in on yelp and noticed a free house margarita offer and showed the bartender. She made the house margarita, and it was completely different! I realize with a happy hour margarita might get diluted or served with well alcohol but this one tasted like lemon lime water!   The appetizers we ordered were ok, chicken flautas and avocado rolls. Good thing they were 25% off for happy hour though."}
{"text":"Food was ok but the service sucks huge. If people are paying you for something, they expect to get it with decent service. Wouldn't really recommend eating here unless it's all that's open. Food was ok though but lame experience."}
{"text":"I've lived in the South Shore Community at Lake Las Vegas for nearly a decade. I've seen businesses in the village come and go so our family diligently attempts to support the restaurants. But no more for the Sonrisa Grill.  We've dined there no less 100 times over the years. And the service/food has been consistently spotty at best. Occasionally an exceptional server will grace your table, but sadly they never seem to stay.  What is AMAZINGLY CONSISTENT is the restaurants overall attitude of not caring a single iota if the food/service is good OR if you EVER come back. Which from now on I will not. In addition, I will go out of my way to ensure no one else I know wastes a single dollar on this roulette wheel of a dining experience. I have been saddened many times for the business owners of the village, but I anxiously await the day this place closes. They do not deserve to be a part of the Lake Las Vegas experience treating customers the way they do."}
{"text":"Good atmosphere, great service, cold beer, margarita's, looking forward to coming back for \"Taco Tuesday\" for all you can eat tacos for $10.00"}
{"text":"My friend and I came here for happy hour/light early dinner while staying at the resort. I had specifically asked for a saltless margarita, and I received one with salt. I ignored this and carried on. We each ordered a prawn skewer and a bowl of albondigas. When we received the soup, it ways way beyond salty.   We managed to notify the waiter who said that he would be right with us. Ten minutes later, he responded to us and we asked for the other soup instead. Another 10 minutes pass and he was VERY attentive to everyone else in the restaurant but us. Mind you, this was not a very busy restaurant and there were only 3 other tables with customers.   He ended up bringing us a cup to sample and our shrimp. The shrimp was very good and we ate that, but he was very slow in attending to us. My friend and I, tired of waiting, decided to add up our own bill and left money as the service was abysmally slow given that this was NOT a bustling restaurant. We noted that the prices were overly high for such bad service and then we went to Auld Dubliner, where we were also disappointed. We are usually good customers who do not usually complain unless the service and/or food suck. Do not patronize this restaurant as it leaves a lot to be desired."}
{"text":"fun, and the enchiladas are pretty dang good but not great. good for pictures, good for eating out with friends but the good could be better."}
{"text":"This is a great restaurant. Service was excellent and the food was as well. I highly recommend the Carnet Asada quesadilla as well as the Carne Asada tacos."}
{"text":"Some places only deserve one star. You found one of them! My friend said it used to be a lot better. It was hot as hell in there. My friend's legs got stuck to the booth's fabric. I've never experienced worse service. The taco hardly had any meat in it, burrito was small, and the service was soooo slow. The waiting area is so small so as people are waiting, they cram in the doorway, propping the door open. Also worth noting, if you make reservations at lets say 7, you will most likely be seated at 7:15-7:20. You are better off looking for a better restaurant at LLV."}
{"text":"We stayed at the Aston on my girlfriend's Groupon, and it came with two free appetizers and two free drinks from Sonrisa.  We stopped in after a wine walk around the marina, so it was probably one of their busier nights. The waiters and waitress (we had any one of three at a given time) were great - friendly, quick to take orders, quick to bring drinks, and staggered delivery of apps and entrees. Unfortunately, great service cannot save bad food.  First of all, the free appetizers we ordered were taquitos - two beef, two chicken. Guacamole is an appetizer unto itself. We each ordered enchilada combo plates, and the enchiladas left much to be desired. They were very bland, and there's no salt and pepper on the table. The Mexican rice and beans were very plain - could've spiced'em up with tomato in the rice and salt in both. We agreed that the cheese was the highlight of the meal.  The house margarita was decent, and the Sonrisa margarita was good. Maybe I should've ordered 5-6, so that I didn't care how bad the food was by the time I ate. We regretted not going for another restaurant option in the area."}
{"text":"This is a two-part review.  Part 1 - we were staying at the Loews down the street and the only thing close was the village.  We decided to give it a go.  The place was dead, like Stepford dead, but we decided Mexican was a great idea.  I was a big fan.  The place was nearly empty, but our server was really cool, the food was solid and they had an awesome brown ale.  Yum.  Part 2 - cut to a few days later...a Saturday night.  Nice day and I was still craving that delicious brown ale so we ventured to the patio at Sonrisa.  It was packed.  Strike one was my beer arriving 2/3 full.  When our food finally arrived, after a LONG wait, I noticed that my burrito had a brown mark on it, I thought it was toasted cheese.  I later came to realize that they must have nuked my meal before it came out because they actually managed to char the sauce on my burrito (still don't know how you do that), my rice was served extra crispy and the beans had that overcooked film on top.  Not good.  That deserves two strikes.  So anyway, if you're stuck at the Loews, you should rent a car and get out of the resort.  If you can't, go on a weekday when the kitchen has less than 10 people to serve."}
{"text":"I was surprised that a 3.5 place was actually not bad in our opinion. Even my boyfriend who is Mexican said it was good.  My boyfriend had the chicken chimichanga and he liked it. Then again he isn't picky but he liked what he ordered. I ordered the Skirt steak tapequena? I ordered it MR but it's a thin slice so it was ok as long as it was pink. It was soft and delicious!  Service was nice and friendly and it was a beautiful day when we sat on the patio. I will be coming back here when we come back to lake Las Vegas :)"}
{"text":"Their chips and salsa deserve 4 stars.  However, here's how our meal started:  \"I would like the ________.\" \"I'm sorry, we don't have that.\" \"Okay, then I'll take the __________.\" \"Oh, we're out of that.\" \"Then, can I have __________?\" \"Sure, we'll get that right out!\"  *10 minutes later*  \"The chef says we can't serve that because we are out. Would you like something else?\"  I ordered the gat damn soup and salad at a Mexican restaurant. I got my food 8 minutes after the food that actually required PREP work showed up.  Their margarita pitcher is $40. The server kept saying they had items that they actually didn't have. The food was okay, but maybe you should know what the hell you are serving. Especially when they JUST opened for lunch service.  I kept playing an episode of Kitchen Nightmares in my head and thinking about what disgusting things must be going on in their kitchen. Maybe they'll be on the show."}
{"text":"I live at Lake Las Vegas and have frequented this restaurant several times.  The service was always \"okay\", but now, it's abominable.  I won't be returning.  Had my sister in town from California and decided to go for Happy Hour on turesday May 24, 2018.  First of all, the restaurant was practically empty which is fine.  Secondly after sitting for 10-15 mins, our waiter came to take our order - we had no menus etc and asked for those before we ordered.  We subsequently placed our food/drink orders.  15 mins minimum later our food/drinks arrived and we had no silverware, plates, napkins, etc.  My sister motioned to the waiter who was hanging out at the bar to please come over (she was super nice about it) to ask for silverware and plates etc.  The waiter stormed over, got in my sisters's face and said he was terribly, deeply offended that she motioned for him to come over rather than an open handed wave.  I mean how bizarre?  We were so stunned that we apologized for not waving and he stormed off.  We then were just left sitting like \"what just happened\"?  A bus boy walked by and a waitress both asked if we were alright and we said we would like some silverware and at this point, the manager.  The \"manager/bartender\" came over and told us the waiter was having a bad day then preceded to tell us about some people in the bar the weekend before who were arrested for harassing a grandmother patron.  No one apologized or suggested the waiter was wrong.  We continually received terrible (or no) service, finally got our check and left.  I will never again return let alone bring anyone to this restaurant.  There are many choices now at Lake Las Vegas.  This place was not only super dirty but the waitstaff was the worst ever experienced betweeen the two of us and we aren't that hard to please.  Just try somewhere else so you're not frustrated and embarrassed In front of your company too.  Del Taco and a Corona 6-pack would've been a better choice $85 later."}
{"text":"Food was good.. not great but good.  Service was amazing!!!  Unfortunately there was a woman at a table next to us (we sat outside) who was smoking. There are very visible no smoking signs posted.  She did not stop smoking after asked.. later she lights up again. Waiting a while and not seeing a restaurant employee I asked her myself to please put it out and pointed to a sign. She rolled her eyes and continued smoking.  I got boxes to take out food to go since I didn't wanna smell her smoke. The staff was very apologetic and accommodating!!!! Gave us a lil discount and also told the woman if it's not put out she'll be asked to leave"}
{"text":"A great place for Mexican in Montelago Village!  Rough economic times have hit the place hard.  But luckily there are still some great restaurants here including Sonrisa!  The dining area is open and colorful!  The service here is phenomenal! They are all friendly and very attentive!  They bring complimentary chips and salsa for the table.  They are warm and delicious! We started off trying their Queso dip.  Good for white Queso dip but could've used a bit more flavor.  I opted to try the prawns enchiladas.  So good! The prawns were large and plenty of them stuffed inside.    If I'm in the area again, I would make this stop again.  Thanks for a great meal!"}
{"text":"We went to Sonrisa with another couple and their daughter and were looking forward to some good Mexican food.    First, the service was horrible.  We ran out of chips and water and were refilled only once.  The food was not great either, no where near the quality I anticipated.    The salsa tasted like tomato paste and my daughter's french fries were cold (she's 3).  I had a taco and chili relleno.  The taco tasted fine, but the chili was very eggy and had an extraordinarily small chili hidden somewhere within.  The rice and beans were decent.  The atmosphere was great on the patio thanks to a jazz band (nearby) and fireworks which were rescheduled from the 4th of July.    Finally, they have a policy that states for a party of 6 or more there would be an 18% tip automatically applied to the check. It was insult to injury since we had bad service, poor food, and 2 of the people in our party were 3 year olds.  And neither of the toddlers left even left a mess!  I won't return."}
{"text":"Place is overpriced I ordered a carne asada burrito came with some super fake Mexican rice with corn. Who the heck eats corn in their rice? Anyways for a burrito I could've gotten at Taco Bell for $3 bucks or so I paid $16.95 for burrito and rice and $3.79 for a freaking 16 oz coke and not half way they eating it I got sick and found myself running back and fourth to the restroom all night. So much for getting some last night I had a date with the restroom instead."}
{"text":"Fabulous Mexican Food -- the Chicken Taco Salad was crisp, fresh and amazing.  My friend had the Enchiladas, which she said were great.  The price is good, the service was fantastic and the atmosphere was great.  An overall Wonderful Experience."}
{"text":"This place is fantastic! Down to the service, atmosphere, and the food will not disatisfy you! Happy hour chicken tacos were my fsvorite! Not to mention the location is perfect right by lake las Vegas."}
{"text":"Sonrisa? No Bueno people. What a complete disappointment. After reading the reviews, I was looking forward to eating some good Mexican food.   I ordered a very basic meal in my opinion....tacos...two chicken and one carne asada. Upon receiving the tacos, I laughed out loud to myself!!!! Lol, the meat was dry (chicken and beef) and was topped with lettuce, tomatoes and cold shredded cheese. The rice and beans were dry. They tasted processed out of a can :-( ugggh  TERRIBLE!!!!! Nothing authentic about this joint. The menu items are overpriced. Waste of time and money. On a positive note, they play very good music. But, tell me....how can the music be better than the food???  Last thing, I ordered guacamole for an appetizer.  $7.00 for a scoop that wasn't freshly made. I guess I'm used to Lindo Michoacan..."}
{"text":"Very disappointing every time I order pick up. I love the food but the lack of competence is very frustrating. Either the food is wrong or they're extremely late with getting the order together. I hope this issue is addressed because it has been a repeated problem."}
{"text":"Im a Local and a regular we make the hour drive out to Lake las vegas specifically for this restaurant ....taco Tuesday is a must! Plus great margaritas! Whenever family is in town this is the place we take them always impresses!"}
{"text":"I'm still trying to figure out what people are complaining about, but we had a pretty good experience.  It took us a minute to find the place, because it was jazz night so we figured it was down by the lake, but it ended up being closer to the casino.    I'll second everyone's comments on the chips and salsa.  Pretty good.  Lots of garlic in the salsa, so you know I'm all over it.  Drinks kept us cool for the warm weather.  Summer beer, mojitos, and ice blended margarita, all made by Omar and all super good.  First time I've had a summer beer and I think that's gonna be my drink of choice next time I'm getting hammered outdoors.  Food-wise, we ordered Avocado Rolls, Ceviche De Mariscos, and Camarones al Mojo de Ajo all recommended by our server Steve.  Everything was pretty damn good.  I don't know if it's because we had low expectations for this place based on reviews, but everything was pretty bomb.  I thought the avocado rolls would be similar to BJ's version, but it was way different.  Pretty good though.  The ceviche was fresh and just overall good flavor.  The Camarones al Mojo de Ajo was really good too.  Lots of flavor and went well with the steamed rice.  Some veggies would have been nice, but still damn good.  If you're in a hurry, don't expect super fast service.  I think the whole point of this place is to enjoy the large portions and each other's company, so the food doesn't come out that fast, but definitely worth the wait.    They also had some guy singing for entertainment.  I guess they have a singer on certain nights of the week.  He was killin' it though.  He had some good choices.  Plus any guy that sings Bobby Brown is a winner in my book."}
{"text":"Not the best place I've been.,Waiter was super nice, waited over an hour to get our food, food was ok and ambiance was nice. Having the DJ playing music outside definitely a nice touch."}
{"text":"We dined last night. When we entered we asked the hostess for a table on the patio by a heat lamp. She said that would be no problem. We get out to the patio and all the heat lamps are bundled together and off. I see her tinker with one and then walk away. A few minutes later our server approached our table and took our drink orders. We mentioned the heat lamps and he said the owner was probably fixing them for us. (We had two kids with us who were freezing). Just as our drinks arrived another table was sat. The hostess/owner came back out to the patio and started to fix the heat lamps by the NEW table. We ordered our food and said if we could not get a heat lamp we would like to move inside. For the next 15 minutes the owner set up and got working two heat lamps for the new table. Once our food arrived she came over and started on ours. I felt like a second rate citizen. We mentioned that it was cold and she said it was because we were drinking margarita's. I said the kids were not drinking margaritas and their hands were freezing she said they should have gotten up and warmed them by the fire pit. With this kind of hospitality from the OWNER I won't need to ever dine here again."}
{"text":"We decided to check out Lake Las Vegas out last night, on Saturday August 5th and seen that most of the restaurants and attractions there were closed. We decided on one of the only restaurants open, Sonrisa Grill. What a mistake. We were told the only seating was outside. The hostess, a blonde girl, walked so fast we didn't even see where she went. We eventually found her waiting for us at a table on the patio. We waited quite a while for our server, a female, to come by with a \"guys ready to order?\" No welcome, suggestions, hello, or anything. We should have simply walked away but decided to stay. Here is where I decided to look at Yelp and noticed the reviews were not the best. The menu was so-so, and a little pricey.  Long story short, food and service was awful. Food was cold, and had very little flavor for being a \"Mexican\" restaurant. We were never checked on until she dropped the check. The family behind us asked for more chips 5 times and finally got them from another server/busser. Not sure but glad they finally got them.  Just hate bad service and bad food. One can make up for the other, but both being bad is horrible... Should have followed my gut feeling when the hostess ran off and we had to find her for our table outside... never again."}
{"text":"Gotta give this place 4 stars. Try the queso blanco (their own recipe) - it's fantastic! Also their Cadillac margaritas are great. Otherwise the food is good to better. The village always looks 'closed' because there are so few people about but we've never found Sonrisa closed during normal business hours. Well worth the trip."}
{"text":"Yes, it takes some effort to find and get there, but so worth the effort. Pretty place on Lake Las Vegas (located in The Village Shopping Center), great margaritas, great food, super friendly and attentive staff."}
{"text":"The civiche was wonderful and the margaritas were real good.  Love sitting listening to the live music and hearing the fountain splash in the background. The lake is always a plus and a spectacular view. If you want to leave Vegas and escape, this is a place to check out."}
{"text":"So grateful for the staff and management at Sonrisa. We had our wedding in their courtyard and it was AMAZING. All of our guests were raving over the Tacos. The food and service was amazing. If you're looking for a great venue out at the lake I recommend them 100%. Facility is clean. Food is good. Thanks!!"}
{"text":"Spitacular customer service! The happy hour menu is delicious and the sangria is the best I've ever had! Will be back time and time again."}
{"text":"I can't say enough good thugs about Sonrisa and it's hands on owner Chanthy. This is my second year hosting an event at Lake Las Vegas and I wouldn't do it without Sonrisa.   Last year I worked with five different restaurants in the Village and we had a great event. This year Chanthy coordinated every meal and break and I couldn't be happier. It was so easy! They had all different types of food for every day - Asian buffet, BBQ ribs and corn with sliders and wings and of course traditional Mexican. We watched March Madness basketball games on the patio with a view of the lake.   She also coordinated a fantastic casino night event for our group. We had table games, a karaoke station and a photo booth. Such a fun night."}
{"text":"The salsa had great flavor and the guacamole was awesome.  We ate so much I didn't leave room for dinner, but that didn't stop us from eating more.  The food was great and the service was great.  The weather was overcast and windy, so we didn't sit outside.  I wish we could have because it is a beautiful setting.  Looking forward to coming back!"}
{"text":"Do not go there, terrible food and terrible service.$104 for 4 sandwich and 4 drinks. One of us vomited after we ate. Waiter unprofessional food terrible."}
{"text":"Taco Tuesday!  Great tacos with melted cheese on the tortillas. Shredded beef tacos were the best!  Marcus was a great server....you should look for him!  He was there when we needed him, but not in the way...a great balance!  My wife had the shrimp tacos and said they were amazing. Didn't skimp on the shrimp or meat!  Great time at Sonrisa Grill!"}
{"text":"First I'm surprised that this fine Mexican restaurant is still in business. Oh the food, decor and service are excellent. It is just tucked inside a hard to get mall that is mostly vacant behind the Lake Las Vegas Hilton.  The food, drinks and service were great. This is my second time here and it was as good as last year. Good for groups. The combination selections are plentiful and flavorful. One of the good restaurant options in an area that needs more upscale variety to go along with the resort properties nearby."}
{"text":"I didn't visit Yelp before visiting Sonrisa because we had not planned on eating there, just wanted to bring some friends who had never been to Lake Las Vegas and we decided to get a drink which turned into ordering food.  The food was pretty good but the service was lousy.  We had no utensils or napkins on our table, the server wasn't very attentive.   We ordered drinks and an appetizer sampler plate.  When the food came we asked the server for napkins and utensils.  When she had not returned in a few minutes we asked the bus boy and he brought them over.  The server then arrived with white paper napkins instead of the cloth ones.   It wasn't very busy yet she was still very slow and when I paid the bill she did not bring my credit card back.   No tip for her.    I'll probably return when I visit Lake Las Vegas since the food and drinks were pretty good but they really need to improve their service."}
{"text":"The food was ok. Everything was pretty rich, even though I just ordered a light appetizer. Since they didn't want to split checks, we sat at different tables within our group, which was lame.   I ordered the Sonrisa Cheese Dip, which came with multi-colored tortilla chips. The dip was made with monterey jack and American cheese with spinach. It was quite flavorful, but very heavy.   The ambience was casual and fun and the waiter was super friendly. I was offered drink refills often. I would go back, just not with a big group."}
{"text":"SUPER slow service.  My quick dinner lasted about and hour and fifteen minutes.  Portions are good, and food was good,  service left something to be desired.  The server actually told us he had a bigger table than us so he was paying more attention to them."}
{"text":"This place is AMAZING! the food came out incredibly fast and was delicious! Portions were HUGE and the entire staff was friendly and outgoing. There was even one guy who just walked around making sure people didn't need anything and enjoyed the food that they ordered. The free chips and salsa come with three different salsas and they were all pretty great. If you are in Zion, don't leave without eating here!"}
{"text":"We stayed st Hilton Lake Las Vegas and for convenience sake we ate  at Sonrisa Mexican Restaurant and it certainly made us smile as the name says! The service is excellent  Cece was honestly one of the best waitresses we've ever had! Everyone was friendly and the halibut tacos were so good!! I'm not s dessert fan usually but the deep fried cheesecake was so yummy.. try it you'll like it! The kimosabe margarita is a smokey mescal and the hefe margarita is a \"no skimp\" drink..."}
{"text":"A great spot for lake view patio dinning at sunset with mister, music and great drinks! The food was good sized and fresh. It is VERY busy on Fri & Sat nights due to limited dinning options out at Lake Las Vegas so reservations are a must! Otherwise opt for bar dinning to get in quicker. Saturday nights they have concerts in the adjacent park so it's dinner and a show!"}
{"text":"The pork enchilada is the best I've had. Cheese enchilada is SUPER!!!! Salsa...yum. Quesadillas are hearty and fresh.  Some folks have had trouble here, but we did not.  Everything was VERY good.  We'll be back, for sure!!"}
{"text":"I had a good time here, I had a nice dinner and then went to the bar they have for after dinner drinks. The food was high quality and presented well, everything ordered from the appetizer to dessert was well worth it. They give you the first round of chips & salsa on the house which is a little added bonus.  The bar was fun, the drinks were a tad pricey for my liking but none the less made for a great evening out"}
{"text":"I love this place, always have...a fun place to hang out and see beautiful Lake Las Vegas. The staff is so friendly and courteous, the food is fab and you cannot miss with their delicious margaritas! Fantastic outdoor patio, warm and inviting indoor atmosphere!"}
{"text":"Our favorite Mexican restaurant in the Vegas metro area! A bit pricier than traditional cantina-style restaurants but service and food are typically great. Best chimichanga I've ever had. Only small complaints are: there are only 2 booths inside and the rest of the main dining room are tables which are typically taken up by large, noisy parties. The fajitas, which I order most regularly are inconsistent with the amount of meat to vegetable ratio. Veggies could be cooked a little more well done to my liking, even when we request it.   If you don't like a lot of blaring loud music, avoid the third Thursday of the month. They just started Music Bingo on that night. Fun if you're up for it. Not so much if you want to talk to your table mates.   Overall, it's our go-to Friday night place!"}
{"text":"Fun American Mexican food and drink. It's off the strip and away from the tourists.  Seats outside have a great view."}
{"text":"Went on Saturday 04-05-14 and had a good time even though it was a lil' windy and crazy cold.  It was HARD to find the darn place and the area is like a ghost town.  I had two pina coladas $ 10 each, they were excellent.  Ordered the avocado roll and they have chicken $ 10.  Comes with 4 and is like a meal if you don't share.  They were insanely good.  Had 1/2 a shrimp enchilada from my friends plate and it was so good.  The fried ice cream was good but I loved the crisp tortilla thing it came with.  Sat in the patio, view was good, and there was an event by the water with a live band.  Thank GOD we sat by fire pit cause it was cold.  BBRRRR!"}
{"text":"Good food, a delightful surprise especially in Vegas and far from Strip.  Our favorite dish of the four ordered was carne asada quesadillas."}
{"text":"Came here on a 'Holiday' weekend (Valentines Day). Made reservations for 630pm but was running behind and called and rescheduled to 7pm. We were seated as soon as we entered. Got our drinks (a delicious Blue Hawaiian for me and a margarita for the husband), plus complimentary chips and guacamole not more than a few minutes after being seated. While our waitress was very attentive, refilling our glasses, offering more chips and guacamole (the 2nd portion in which was not complimentary), our orders were finally taken. Our wait for our meal was an estimated 35-40 minutes and we had ordered a simple chicken chimichanga, chicken sandwich and and carne asada chimichanga. We were apologized to for the long wait more than once. Food was tasty but not remarkable. Beautiful view of Lake Las Vegas if you request an outdoor table. I had originally requested an outdoor table but it was a little colder than expected and they accommodated us inside right away. Nice getaway from the hustle and bustle of the Strip, and I'll always support any business in Lake Las Vegas/Montelago village because the area is beautiful."}
{"text":"We had an amazing meal here...granted it was 3 years ago. Had a spicy shrimp dish and it was so delicious. Service was wonderful as was atmosphere. Both my husband and I still talk about the amazing Mexican meal we had here. Give it a try...."}
{"text":"Had a lull in meetings and was in the area so I went out to the Village at Lake Las Vegas for lunch. I went to Sonrisa Grill. I ordered the two tacos with shredded beef. They came with rice and beans and of course the customary chips and salsa delivered to the table while you wait. The food was good, reasonably priced. My bill for lunch including my soft drink and fried ice cream was $25.57. One thing to note though. Unlike other places, only your first basket of chips and salsa are complimentary,  they charge for each additional basket of chips and salsa they bring out after the first. Another thing I noticed, for a Mexican restaurant,  they had a lot of American dishes on their menu and only the Mexican basics like tacos, enchiladas, burritos, quesadillas, chili releno,  etc on the menu. Still, great looking place and really great, friendly service."}
{"text":"I never judge a restaurant negatively from just one visit.  I given this restaurant 3 opportunities to earn my satisfaction when I go out for Jazz on the Lke.  It just doesn't seem like it's going to happen.  The food is just okay but the service is just far below standards and super slow, especially given where it's located."}
{"text":"My husband and I came here for lunch. We tried a few appetizers. We had the avocado roll it's with chicken bacon tomatoes and cheese deep fried with avocado is chipotle ranch sauce. SO good! Lots of flavor! We also had the chicken tacos it comes with 2 small street tacos the chicken is marinated in a sweet chilli sauce with a touch of olive oil they were very delicious. And we had the shrimp ceviche small portion but enough appetizers to fill us up.  Airserver Miguel was very friendly. Would definitely come back"}
{"text":"Salsa, chips and water were great and got to the table fast. 20 minutes later they took our order. 40 min later we inquired about our food (appetizers and one entree) and the waiter forgot to put it in. We left. Great potential though - patio was pleasant with a fire pit, guy singing Motown, grass nearby for the kids to play on. Guess we should wait for Omar to be working to attempt again."}
{"text":"The absolute worst. Everything we ordered had something wrong with it   My husbands chimichanga was a burrito and wasn't enchilada style as ordered, daughters chimi was enchilada style and was supposed to be on the side. Anejo Don Julio was silver and when we said this isn't anejo he said no its silver and kept putting it on the table and walked away. The food was not good!  They took 10 minutes to recognize people coming in the door. We had to ask for refills on water and at one point there were 7 staff members just standing around. Very disappointing on our daughters 1st wedding anniversary!  I would highly recommend eating someplace else. Roberto's would have been better or Taco Bell."}
{"text":"Not the fastest service   It the food is great and it's a comfortable and vibrant atmosphere that you want to be in. The food tastes great and they keep the chips and salsa coming!  Great place for a first, second or twentieth date!"}
{"text":"Ok seriously LLV, wth are you smoking... this place is mexcellent.  Victor was over the top hospitable.  He let us sample one of the soups that they'll be rolling out on their upcoming lunch soup menu.  It was a delicious Mexican spin on traditional chicken soup.  A citrus note along with the standard cilantro made the soup wonderfully refreshing while still maintaining a nice hearty feel with large chicken pieces that, get this, were incredibly tender - not the dried out, tough, flavorless bites usually found in chicken soup.  The vegetables in the soup also had a nice crispness and weren't all mushy.  The margaritas are dangerously delicious.  So smooth, yet so potent!  You can just barely tell that they have a heavy hand with the tequila because the citrus mixture they create is so perfect - just enough tang and tart without the sickening sweetness.  The pitchers are enormous, but it's scary how quickly you can drain one!  The queso dip is absolutely phenomenal.  I love the small amount of cooked spinach in it that makes me feel like I can write it off as \"healthy\" - ha!  The guacamole is good and very fresh, but not really a star.  The two standout entrees at our table were by far the Pescado A la Veracruzana (with Halibut) and the Camaraones al Mojo de Ajo.  The sauce on both dishes was good enough to warrant licking the plate."}
{"text":"This place is always festive,happy ,nice people ,good food and pretty on their patio with live music Tue and Sundays ."}
{"text":"Love taco Tuesday here. They have the best shredded beef tacos in town. Well close to town. The atmosphere is good, the service is great, and my wif and I always love coming here. It's kind of a drive from where we live but always worth it. I would give this place 5 stars if it weren't  for that drive. I also wish lake las vegas would get it together and find a way make the area work."}
{"text":"I can't say enough about this place.  I felt compelled to write a review immediately.....I'm still sitting on their patio digesting. LOL.  The salsa and guacamole are super fresh and delicious.  The sangria (red) is delicious.  Every bit as good as our favorite from Milo's Wine Cellar in Boulder City .  I had the steak and chicken fajita and it was outstanding. My wife had the skirt steak and it was tender and seasoned perfectly.  The staff was very friendly and engaging. Chris, the GM, took time to chat with us at length and made us feel very welcome. We highly recommend this place.  Lindo Michocan used to be my go to Mexican restaurant.  Not any longer."}
{"text":"This Mexican Restaurant is located in Montelago Village, a new development community in the Las Vegas Lake area. The menu is very basic with the standard Mexican American fare but it is authentic and good.   Upon seating we are served a basket of hot tortilla chips and salsa. I'm not a fan of the multi coloured red, green and natural chips but the salsa is tasty. They use green onions instead of ted onions.   For our mains, I ordered the pork enchiladas with green sauce, re-fried beans and rice. It was the perfect amount and well done. The cheese topping was ok. A word of caution, they are served really really hot! So wait a few minutes before taking a bite!I prefer plain melted cheese.   Husby had chicken tacos which were ok, the chicken was a bit dry and I'm not a fan of the lightly crisped up taco shells, I like corn tortillas warm and soft.   Service was excellent, as soon as your fork goes down, they swoop in and cleanup!"}
{"text":"Service was ok. Food was nothing special with prices in the stratosphere. They'll charge you $3 to split a plate."}
{"text":"Was staying at the Hilton so we decided to have some dinner before heading back to the room.  We got seated pretty fast it wasn't too busy but did start to pick up a little bit during our dinner. Our order was taken pretty quick. Good arrived in reasonable time. But after that everything seemed to get slower. Maybe it was because it was getting busy but checks took extremely long to come.   The food was very mediocre. It was definitely not authentic Mexican food. Everything lacked in flavor and spice. I think the thing I enjoyed the most was the salsa that was brought out complimentary."}
{"text":"Amazing staff....excellent service.  Food is fresh and very authentic.  Margaritas are to die for so order a pitcher.  Sitting outside, listening to music of the local talent, enjoying the beautiful view of the lake.  A well kept secret that locals need to try.  It is well worth the drive.  You will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"Went to eat here with the family Tuesday night. Husband had beans with his meal. As he was eating he bit into something hard which caused him severe pain.. What did he bite into? A rock! Yes, a rock!   This rock chipped his tooth. They got the manager, Christopher Colby.  He casually explained how this does happen from time to time.. What!?! I've been to many Mexican restaurants in my life and NEVER has this ever happened.. They didn't offer to pay for any damage, didn't offer to pay for the bill. Nothing. All he did was give us his card and said to call him if my husband is still in pain...  I've made an appointment with the dentist for my husband to get his tooth fixed and we will be presenting the bill to Sonrisa Grill.. I will update my review with how that goes.."}
{"text":"I have mixed emotions about this quaint little restaurant. This restaurant is actually very attractive in looks, it has a great design and it sits in a lovely location of Lake Las Vegas, not far off the Lake...the food is decent.I ordered the Veggie burrito and it was just not up to Veggie Burrito standards, there was Veggies in this burrito that just should not be allowed in burritos. There may be people that dig it,but I think they did too much with the Veggies and the burrito combination...But very good alcoholic drinks mixes and a great atmosphere especially in the summer,with it's occasional live music...would I go back???\"ABSOLUTELY I WILL\""}
{"text":"Mexican is my favorite cuisine, coming from the San Fernando valley in southern California, I expected an American mexican food menu from Sonrisa. Instead, it was amazing! Best ceviche I've ever had! Fried ice cream was so good! Their menu will satisfy any palate. These guys know Mexican! I'd rate this place as best Mexican food outside of Mexico. I wish I lived closer so I could eat there everyday."}
{"text":"After visiting the skating rink at Lake Las Vegas on a sunny Saturday the gals and I were craving margaritas.  So, we figured a joint with the name \"Sonrisa Grill\" would fit the bill.  They definitely came through there!  We split a pitcher of margaritas flavored with blood oranges, and it was yummy.  We also tried out the guacamole (standard and tasty), and the ceviche (good, middle of the road as well).  We were all creeped out by the neon red and green chips that came in the basket, we could definitely do without that, but it fits the bill for a quick stop for the standards."}
{"text":"The food was decent and the drinks were good but nothing I would really make the trip out to come back for. The ambiance is nice but it's weird that they have an upstairs storage area that's so easy to see, boxes everywhere, piñata, whatever.   The problem we had was with the service, someone ordered a drink and it didn't show up so we asked the server if he forgot and he said no that he already told them to make it but they were waiting for him to return from outside (okay, maybe) but then returned a few min later to say that they couldn't make the drink because they don't stock grapefruit juice which is also okay but don't say you put in the order if you couldn't have because they don't stock one of the ingredients. Overall it was just okay."}
{"text":"Taco Tuesday is a must!  If it's not Tuesday still go the food is good, the staff is friendly and the price is reasonable"}
{"text":"Great mexican restaurant.  food good, prices reasonable, great service and terrific happy hour.  Omar, the bartender, is fantastic.  makes great drinks and makes everyone feel like family.  Other staff great as well.  Feels like a cozy family restaurant. Moved to LV from NYC and go there all the time.  Thanks OMAR!  Mike & Bev"}
{"text":"I rarely give lower than four stars because I find places through yelp. This time, however, we just went to what was around and available.   1. SERVICE: The group in front of us was told they'd be seated. The hostess was running around like crazy. It took about 20 minutes for her to just acknowledge we were there to get our party size, about 10 more minutes to actually be seated. Our server didn't arrive for another 10 minutes. We almost left after we had a good helping of chips. Finally, we asked a random server/busperson if we could have waters. By the time the server came to take our drink orders, we were ready to order food, too. The food took FOREVER!  2. FOOD: It was crusty and COLD. I gave two stars because 2 items (out of our 8 plates) were decent. Otherwise, I would have given 1 star.   Basically, if you're in The Village at Lake Las Vegas, check yelp to see if it's worth your trouble."}
{"text":"fun fun fun! another stop on our visit to lake las vegas margaritas and a very engaging bartender. So many tequila to try!"}
{"text":"The only reason I am giving 2 stars, as opposed to 1, is that I have been here before and not had the problems I did on this visit.  The waiter was by far one of the worst I have ever had. It must have been at least 20 minutes between him taking our drink orders and coming back for our food order. When he finally did come back he acted annoyed at having to listen to our orders (no substitutions or special requests). It took 40 minutes for the first appetizer to come out, another 20 for the next and 20 more for the entrées to arrive. Not one time did he come by to ask if we needed condiments and we had to flag down a busboy to ask for silverware so we could eat. When he refilled our waters he actually slammed my girlfriend's glass on the table.  I know they were busy because of the beer festival but it wasn't exactly a surprise event, have people on staff that can handle a rush.  The chips and salsa was good though."}
{"text":"Have you ever been turned down by a restaurant because they were \"too busy\" to make you food? Tonight was definitely a first. It was shocking to see an establishment turn away money and to top it off, The hostess straight up said \"nothing personal\" about the situation. I think I was more upset about how she handled herself. I understand you may have had a long day but have the decency to have proper customer service. I drove 30 minutes out of my way to eat here and I left disappointed, upset, and with no food. Ended up going to Taquiera Guadalajara 10 minutes away and found my new \"Go To\" spot for Mexican food. Will not be frequenting Sonrisa Grill anymore."}
{"text":"Had the steak fajitas here to go on a late night when. The town is very dead so I was not expecting anything great. When I saw the price it seemed expensive, $20.95, but it was well worth it. Some of the best fajitas I have ever had. Came with a nice freshly chopped salsa, lettuce, cheese, rice and beans. The best part was the steak from the fajita excellent quality meat."}
{"text":"Hello fellow yelpers! I've eaten a lot of Mexican food in my time, it's my absolute favorite! The problem is...so many Mexican restaurants all taste the same and have the same bland taste in the end. Not sonrisa grill! Their food is absolutely fantastic! Once you take that first bite you'll understand that it's the freshest, best tasting Mexican food you can probably get here in Vegas. Put away your phones and stop what you're doing! Get in your car and drive over to Lake las vegas to experience this amazing restaurant. In all honesty the service is great, but seems a little under staffed so it might take more than a few minutes to place your order and get your check, but I promise that the food makes up for it keeping my rating at a 5 star review!"}
{"text":"My experience here was so bad I always have my family from out of town to stay in lake Las Vegas cause I thought it would be nice quiet and relaxing . We thought to watch the football game cause they had signs that they showing the game we got welcome in they were very nice but could not put the volume on the game I thought oh well lets stay .. we ordered food drinks the food came out I thought the cheese smells weird I thought maybe it's just how it should smell lol ... we finished dinner the game was still on so suddenly we smell cleaning liquid by the bathroom I guess they cleaned it but it was so strong we started to get a headache I know you need to clean but really 6:30 pm dinner time it was so ridiculous!!! Didn't complain we moved outside then left after .. this review is important the next morning I got food poisoning I know it was from here cause I went to doctor it was a mild one thank god this was the only place I ate that day .. we try to give business to a place that's off the strip but this makes me go there .."}
{"text":"Refused us service and take out because they were \"too busy\". We arrived at 8:45pm and they still had 45 minutes left before they closed. I've uploaded a picture to show just how not busy they are. As we were walking out she smiled and said \"nothing personal\"."}
{"text":"Went here for drinks. Great place. Great service. Amazing happy hour! Good views of the lake!"}
{"text":"Good place with good mexican food - 5.00 brews - pleasant staff-few other options at Lake Las Vegas"}
{"text":"Excellent experience,  the food was wonderful and the service was outstanding.  with 2 kids ages 7 and 5, the menu had great options for the kids.  very friendly and fast service.  this is one of the jewels of lake Las Vegas.  Highly recommend and will go back there soon"}
{"text":"One of the best Margarita's I've ever had. Excellent, really fresh Mexican food. I had the chicken quesadillas. The service could use a little improvement, which is why I'm giving four instead of five stars."}
{"text":"Muy Bien!! Food was EXCELLENT!! Our server, Lea was awesome. We definitely would return for the food and dining experiences we received today next  trip to Lake Las Vegas,...Gracias, Lea!!"}
{"text":"hubby and i came here after a couple's photo shoot at lake las vegas. we had never heard of this restaurant before but love mexican so we thought we would give it a try. i absolutely loved it here. i dont understand the poor yelp reviews because our food was delicious and the service was on point. the only mark down i give this place is the time it took to check out.  we were able to sit on the patio when we went. the sun was setting and a chill was beginning. someone came and started a fire which really set the ambiance for us. a jazz band was also setting up near by. the chips and salsa were good, our waiter was attentive, we didnt have to wait too long for our food. the sangria was one of the best i have had and they had my hubby's favorite beer: bohemia. overall it was a wonderful surprise dinner. the only bad was the check out time....it took wayyyyy too long. that wouldnt stop me from going back though; and i live in NLV!"}
{"text":"Wow! Terrible... First, it's really hot in here... I'm not the only customer in here whipping the sweat of his face... Next, long island ice tea and margarita taste the same... Both have this really weird dish water after taste.. GF is now refusing to drink hers.. That's a first..  Just got the food .. Microwave style and not as good as Taco bell.  Ok dinner is done, one margarita not touched, one long island ice tea 3/4 consumed. Food left on plate 50% --- waiter has now disappeared for the last 15 mins.. There are now a lot of confused people trying to figure out if everyone who works here left for the night..  Waiter took off the $12 for the margarita but not the Long Island ice tea. I was really too hot to fight about it. Sonrisa Grill is  probably on top 3 worst Mexican places I have EVER eaten at!! Stay away!"}
{"text":"The first time we went the waitress was amazing. Very attentive and sweet. The food was alright and the only bad thing is that they skimp out on the alcohol in the drinks and they don't have happy hour on Saturday. They also don't have carry out after 8."}
{"text":"My wings were under cooked the waitress said she would talk to the manager she never did they did not even take 1 dollar of the bill, my boyfriend was not impressed with the all you can eat tacos my first time there not interested in returning."}
{"text":"I love coming out to Lake Las Vegas, it is a hidden gem of a destination and more people should take the extra half hour for a \"getaway\"  What I loved: The setting is charming, the decor is bright, warm, inviting and a Santa Fe like vibe. We both had salads and we were both impressed. This is not an iceberg blah blah one, it was flavorful and we were both impressed. We both agreed that the mango dressing was excellent, and is one of a kind The margarita my friend ordered was very nice according to her. The server was charming and nice and she made up for the errors in our order.   What needs improvement: The server returned with our salads and did not remember which dressing my friend ordered on the side so she returned quickly with the request. I began to eat and after eating the top layer I was given her chicken and she had my salmon. If she was not suck I would have simply traded the plates. Details are so important when it comes to serving, and if she wasn't so nice we both agreed it would have been more of a deal breaker.   I did mention the restaurant to a friend in Henderson and they like it but I was told dogs are not allowed on the patio. I will confirm this because normally I have Henry the Dog with me when I can I take him everywhere and I would definitely make a point to return!   If you want to feel like you traveled a 1,000 miles away, this is the spot!"}
{"text":"Food is great! Service is great! The salsa is amazing!! Drinks are strong! Good place!"}
{"text":"Don't eat here if there's a big event going on, like 4th of July. You wait in line for 10 min to get your name on the list with an hr wait. After an hr the hostess doesn't know how much longer of a wait it's going to be, just that there's an x amount of people in front of you. Hostess gives this place one star."}
{"text":"We dined January 18th..this restaurant has been here since 2007..I was surprised. .salsa was horrible and I was warned on it by neighboring hotel staff..however hotel recommended the food was good..I do not agree..guacamole was fantastic and very fresh..our meals had delicious tacos, and mediocre  enchiladas. .my meal had usually a flagship of Mexican menus, a Chile Relleno..it was weak, very weak..unflavorful and tasted lousy..standard sized Marqaurita @$16 seems kinda expensive..that was the only beverage purchased (only1)..we ordered no sodas..total $71..apparently i am missing something if local patrons keep this place operating..it's location very difficult to find..i hope the restaurant finds reviews as opportunity to improve..btw, the place is nice and the staff was good..good luck!"}
{"text":"We wanted to find a restaurant within Lake of Las Vegas, since that is where our cousins are staying with a 2 month old.  After giving up on finding a 4 star place to eat within the area, Earl made an executive decision to try out Sonrisa.    When we arrived on a Friday at 6:30ish pm, there were not many people at Lake of Las Vegas.  It was very dead.  When we got to the restaurant, there were not many guests there either.    The food was mediocre at best.  I got the avocado rolls, Earl got the...I don't even remember.  It was so unmemorable.    Earl asked the waitress if they make good Michelada.  She said yes with confidence.  When she brought out the michelada, the color was off.  It was no bueno.  Summary:  We won't be coming back."}
{"text":"I am updating my review a year later.  This place still has an amazing view and since we live in the neighborhood we used to come every Sunday for dinner.  Then the food and the service got progressively bad.  Today we decided to give it another chance a year later since we heard it's under new ownership. The view is still amazing.  However, when we walked in the restaurant during a very busy lunch hour, the hostess greeted us with \"the Kitchen is broken so we are not serving food\".  I asked: \"well, since you are a restaurant, are you planning on having food any time soon?  The lady answered: \"maybe...in a few hours\". Once again, we won't be coming here anytime soon.  And...we live next door to this place.  We would recommend it to our friends and neighbors if we had a half decent experience but that didn't happen...and this is the third time.  Wow!!! They really don't care about getting our business!!! So this was my review last year. ...here's the updated one: This is my third time coming here this year.  I live at Lake Las Vegas and once again I am very disappointed..I am a regular at all Lake Las Vegas restaurants.  There were five people in my party I asked to be seated outside at the large table which was open. There were six seats at the table, the manager told me \"no you can't sit here I am saving the table for a bigger party\".  Apparently once again locals who live out here are not welcome.  I am done with this place.  Also, anyone who cares about food quality shouldn't eat here the food is very bad  and highly overpriced .  If you are a local stay clear. Taco Bell would be a better option."}
{"text":"Over priced and everything is spiced with way too much cayenne pepper! Waaaaay too much... what are they trying to hide????"}
{"text":"On our journey down to lake Las Vegas after baking in the hot Las Vegas sun we decided to get something to eat at Sonrisa Grill and what a little treat it was. Now there is not to many shops that are open down on the lake so this place was pretty packed and hard to miss . So upon entering the first thing you will notice is the very festive decor with kind of a old world Spanish town type of vibe. The place was hopping but they only had 1 waitress taking care of the whole establishment which was pretty crazy so it took a while to be seated and to order.   One thing that was pretty awesome is they have happy hour on a Sunday which was a pleasant surprise so of course I couldn't resist, I immediately put down the regular menu and went into my value eat mode lol. They have quite a few choices and everything is under $6 which is nice. So we ordered the avocado rolls, chicken tacos, shrimp ceviche, buffalo wings, sangria, and a like margarita. So by far the avocado roll and the chicken tacos were standing tall!! The chicken taco was seasoned extremely well and had a distinct sweet flavor that was very unique and if there already wasn't so much food I would have ordered at least 4 more lol. They have a AYCE  taco Tuesday for $13 which I will be going back for so I can put a hurting on those tacos and I recommend that if your in the area that you join me :). The rolls were also very tasty and kinda reminded me of a potato skin but very gourmet style. The rest of the food was good and the value was fantastic so I would eat there again in a heartbeat, matter fact if they had a location in the city and proper staff I guarantee it would be busy all the time.  One other nice thing is they have a patio area with live entertainment which is relaxing and can make for a great date spot where you can relax ,listen to music, and be right on the lake"}
{"text":"If you're looking for some authentic Mexican food, go somewhere else. I didn't completely give them one star for at least the effort of variety for vegetarians and pescatarians, as each dish gives you options for your protein or to just have veggies. The chips and salsa we're very salty. We thought it may just be the chips so we brushed the salt off them but to our dismay the salsa was filled with salt as well. I ordered the combo with shrimp taco and veggie enchilada. The taco's description was something like \"slightly crisped soft shell\" or something along those lines which I was up for something different. But, it more tasted like it was a crispy shell gone stale because it was difficult to bite though. They put a lot of shrimp which seemed nice, but it was also pretty bland. Feels like they took the cocktail shrimp and attempted to pan fry it and just put a bit of salt. Husband got the veggie burrito. All of our food felt like they omitted all the spices and flavors that define Mexican food, and instead just relied on salt and cheese. And the kicker for me was that we brought our two ESA dogs and specifically came to this place because there was patio seating and we didn't want to be trouble. They quietly were minding their own business under our table and some man who we assume was the manager, yet never approached us, kept glaring at us the entire meal. I feel like 2 stars is fair for our experience. Maybe the steak/chicken options are better. Maybe this place is more ideal if you just want to grab a beer. But if you don't eat chicken or red meat, may want to skip this place."}
{"text":"The only good things about this place is the service and the guacamole lol the food is not authentic and bland..."}
{"text":"We go to Lake Las Vegas just to eat here!  It is definitely worth the drive and never disappoints!  The food is phenomenal!"}
{"text":"What a wonderful spot! This place has a great view of the lake, lots of trees and perfect outdoor seating with lights strung across the top and fire lamps around the venue. We only ordered a few items such as cheese dip, guacamole and tortilla soup, all good. The server, Omar, I believe, was so nice and funny and I really appreciate that! Overall excellent experience and will be back."}
{"text":"Have been here twice once for a normal dinner, and that went so well that I decided to have a Board Retreat at the same venue!  If you are going for a Margarita, La Jefa is definitely the way to go - they are amazing!  If you get the Queso, ask for it spicy - it's delish!  We rented out the patio area on the second time for a group of 65 people and had a blast.  It was during slightly windy evening, but the fire pit and heat lamps were perfect.  Chris, the onsite Event Planner was fantastic to work with and very accommodating.  The staff was fun and always had great recommendations for tequila."}
{"text":"Meh' I've never had Mexican, thought it was an experience to behold but was let down. Only gave 3 because kids / husband liked their meals.   The beans that you serve with some meals looks like poop and to add insult to injury it looks as though it had been put on the plate hours before the actual food was. The Chula (not sure of the spelling) was too big for one person and sadly, very bland. Husband liked his fish, kids liked their tacos. The nachos and dip at the start of the meal were nice but those little dishes you have the condiments in where difficult to scoop out of.   Server & service was very friendly & fast."}
{"text":"Omar at the SONRISA GRILL makes a mean Blue Patron Margarita! Great vibes and wonderful afternoon experience! Thank you OMAR!"}
{"text":"Wow Steven  was an amazing server, He told me to order the Camerones al mojo de ajo and it was so good i will most definitely be back!!!!"}
{"text":"Nice staff however the chefs don't know the difference between an appetizer and an entree."}
{"text":"My husband and I live close by but there are still many choices! This is always on the top of the list! We love the staff, food and ambiance!"}
{"text":"\"Where do you want to have lunch?\" \"I don't know.  Let me check Yelp.\"  Boy, I wish I had that particular conversation with my colleagues this afternoon before deciding on Sonrisa Grill.  Instead, we chose Sonrisa pretty much at random, and paid for our mistake.    As I read the other reviews on Yelp (there was nothing else to do, since the waiter had apparently decided to take a semester off to study flamenco dancing in Barcelona or something), I noticed that many reviewers complained of slow service.  They were right.  I mean, really, really right.  Think glacially slow.  Think the Colorado River carving the Grand Canyon slow.  Even endangered ground sloths would be looking around with a befuddled \"What the hell?\" look on their little slothy faces.  45 minutes.  45 minutes from when we were seated until the waiter managed to fit us into his busy schedule.  I don't think this is an accurate assessment, however, because one of my companions ACTUALLY FLAGGED DOWN A BUSBOY to ask him to get our waiter for us.  Once he did appear and asked if we were ready to order, it took an additional 30+ minutes to get our food out of the kitchen.  Several of my companions had to leave and we had to take their orders to them in to go containers because they had foolishly thought that an hour and a half was sufficient time to eat lunch.  How silly is that?  The food was typical undistinguished Mexican food (a slice above Taco Bell, but below most Mexican restaurants that don't feature a kid's meal with a toy).    In short, don't plan on anything else if you lunch at the Sonrisa Grill.  You will be there until the dinner hour..."}
{"text":"Another great night, great food, amazing service and breathtaking views. Went back for taco Tuesday and the place was packed! Waited not to long for a table on the patio, weather was cool and a light breeze blew threw the air. The hostess was so sweet and our server Alex and the rest of the staff were on point, attentive and hospitable. With as busy as it was food came out in a timely manner. We had the seafood flautas, delish and the bean dip for appetizer. The bean dip I wouldn't recommend! Im actually disappointed, it looked and taste like they scooped beans right out of the can and threw them in a bowl and topped with cheese. I had the pork tamale plate for dinner and holy shizz it was good. My husband, the all you can eat tacos...he LOVES them. He loves the way the tortillas are soft fried, the carne asada and pork meats are his favorites.   A must go to if your in the area! If your in a hurry and its busy go to Mc Donald's. This ain't fast food this is in yo mammas kitchen food which is always the best and takes time."}
{"text":"Great people and service .great food salsa  chips.and food are amazing.had the best time in cinco de mayo.My family enjoy everything here"}
{"text":"Great food, chips and salsa wasn't bad, the margaritas were tasty with lots of options, and server was sweet and helpful!"}
{"text":"Terrible experience! The owner decided she would do some construction on her tables with air compressors on her patio. And even though the guests were very annoyed, she continued on. Ruining the beautiful day with her noise.  To make matters worse, I was there with my service animal and after complaining about the noise she and her manager began to harass me about my dog. And eventually refused to serve us and asked us to leave. We had already ordered our drinks. The claim she made was the sheriffs department instructed her to ask what the service animal was for. I was too embarrassed to say.   I will be meeting with the sheriffs department next Tuesday to verify this illegal practice. The situation was distressing and embarrassing.   Not only was the owner rude but the manager was antagonistic and aggressive.   Never patronize this place!"}
{"text":"This place is TERRIBLE. We waited for 90 minutes for our food to come out. The service was bad and our drinks ran dry several times while we suffered through our interminable wait for our food.   Granted, the food was good - but definitely not worth the crappy service or the unreasonable wait, especially considering we were one of only three groups in the entire restaurant. Would not come here again."}
{"text":"Slow service, even with few patrons. The food was alright. Atmosphere was nice, except for all of the 4th of July shoved underneath credenzas ( a week after the celebration) HINT: If you do not have the space to store it....try a table cloth. This is my second time here. It has not really improved. I usually like to try things at least 3 times, before I officially make a decision, so I MIGHT take another shot at this place, but....I have to be honest, unless this place really knocks my socks off....and I am talking a virtual party in my mouth, I just cannot recommend this place. There are far more deserving eateries within the Lake Las Vegas community that really know how to treat their customers."}
{"text":"Went with bf on a Wednesday night. Nice location- seems like a very low-key, relaxing kind of place to hang out around. Plus it was nice to get a little out of the city. Couldn't see that much in the dark- we might come back to check out the activities in daylight.    We were seated in a really nice, cozy, and private booth. The staff (Daniel) was quick to wait on us, friendly, and really good about coming back to check on us frequently even though we were kind of hidden. He was knowledgeable about the foods and able to steer us towards some good choices. I got the beef enchilada and avocado taco combo- both were good. The rice was surprisingly good-I usually just expect the rice to be a bland or badly spiced side, but this was yummy! I actually considered asking for more    They didn't have any horchatas, so I also got the Jolly Rancher, which was okay at first but wound up tasting like cough syrup and then the house white zin, which was DISGUSTING- I know house stuff isn't supposed to be the cream of the crop, but at $7 for 1/2 of a small wine glass you expect something you don't have to choke down! This review would've been 4 (maybe even 5) stars if the drinks hadn't been so bad, so my advice is to enjoy the food but steer clear of the drinks!"}
{"text":"The food itself was solid, but it took an agonizing amount of time for anything we ordered to arrive. The appetizers actually came out after the entrees. This was particularly vexing since we were seated on the patio under the unforgiving glare of the Las Vegas sun. I assume that they were understaffed. Failing that, our server must have been totally incompetent."}
{"text":"Had a little staycation this weekend with my better half. I must say the food was pretty good, the service on the other hand was mediocre at best. To start the evening off the hostess was no where to be found when we walked in. She then proceeded to greet folks from a far.. our server he was a nice stout gentleman, seemed to be overwhelmed. I would come again, but maybe during the week for a happy hour."}
{"text":"Excellent customer service! Logan our waiter was phenomenal! The avocado dip was fresh & delicious. The Cadillac Margarita was two thumbs up."}
{"text":"This restaurant is a hot mess. We came here during the Mardi Gras festival so you'd think they would know a larger crowd than norm would be there. They had a nice patio but when we tried to get seated no one acknowledged us or seemed like they even knew what was going on. After finally getting a table we watching one of the busboys spill and entire tray of waters on the table in front of us (accidents happen but these people were rushing around like they were completely understaffed and overwhelmed). We got the menus, single sheets of paper with maybe 5 entrees available. No kids meals were offered. Our waitress was nice but the food was just not good. I got a salad and it just lacked any flavor at all. The tacos were not good either. The lights in the patio went out halfway through and there was like like zero water pressure when washing our hands in the restroom. You'd think they would serve their best to bring in new customers on a night like this but we just walked away feeling ripped off."}
{"text":"We were there last Saturday night for our daughters 12th birthday, and she brought 3 friends. Could not have asked for anything better! The waiter was so attentive to all our requests! Food was really good and the Margaritas were excellent!!!  We stayed at the Hilton, so they gave us our drinks in go cups when we left....we got a pitcher so my husband & I weren't able to quite finish.... Will definitely go back next time we want a \"staycation\"  Hilton gives a great \"local rate\"!"}
{"text":"I was at Sonrisa Grill for a large meeting/dinner. We were outside around the fire pit. It was magical. Our waiter Chris, was fabulous, the food was great and the atmosphere was just wonderful. I highly recommend this restaurant for fantastic food..."}
{"text":"Sat down quickly receive service very fast I ordered the chile relleno with a chicken enchilada chips salsa and guacamole the food was very flavorful hot out of the kitchen our drinks were never empty our meals were well presented on the plate not only did it taste wonderful but it looks wonderful my husband ordered the tacos they were awesome as well the price is very reasonable and the atmosphere is awesome definitely a five star for me... First time I actually had rice at a Mexican restaurant that tasted awesome highly recommend"}
{"text":"Very nice view of the lake! Very nice looking restaraunt that sits directly in front of Lake Las Vegas. We ordered some cocktails and appetizers. Food was Ok, but the ambience is what makes this place. We went on a Saturday afternnon, there was no wait and we got seating on the outdoor patio. Waiter was very nice and attentive. They had a musician playing a guitar, with some new and old songs. We had the appetizer plate that was mostly fried items, nothing that really stood out, but it was decent. Chips and Salsa was very good though. I ordered the blood orange margarita that didnt have too much flavor and was kinda watery. My boyfriend ordered a Manhattan that he said was strong and good. I went inside to use the restroom which was modern and super clean. The inside of the restaraunt is also decorated nicely with hispanic folk lore decor. Overall, nice experience and good service."}
{"text":"How often do you need reservations last minute for a party of 30. You usually don't until you do. This restaurant not only took the reservations but treated us as if we were a party of four. The service level was spectacular.  The freshness and flavours of the chips and salsa was second to nothing I have had in the past. The flavours in the entrees were brilliant. Did I mention  their margaritas? Perfection, rounding out our party of thirty dinning experience giving a perfect 5."}
{"text":"Went to Lake Las Vegas and found a ghost town. Place was empty. Only restaurant open at 2pm on a Saturday. We were the only people in the restaurant. I had a Tostada with shrimp which was basically lettuce on a tortilla with 3 prawns. Boyfriend had steak fajitas which were ok. Had a beer and a glass of wine. $80 bill. Thought $80 for an ok Mexican lunch was way to much."}
{"text":"Wonderful and friendly place. They have delicious food drinks and dessert. Try the chicken or pork tacos they're great. The fried ice cream is delicious. Per my 9 and 12 year old \"This place is amazing!\" And I agree!"}
{"text":"Awesome place the staff was very friendly and my shredded beef tostada was delicious!! Oh and the drinks are so tasty and strong an A Plus! in my book!!"}
{"text":"Meh it's another Mexican food restaurant , nothing bad but nothing great. Prices a little high but if you come to lake lasvegas then you already should expect that. The area is sooooooper slow so it's kinda nice to have the area by yourself but then again kinda creepy in zombie apocalypse kinda way lol. But sure I'd come back"}
{"text":"My husband and I were out at the Lake Las Vegas Village for a Wine Walk.  We wanted to have something in our stomachs during the tasting.  We walked in and were sat inside immediately.    Here's a grading scale breakdown: Service: C I know they were extra busy because of the wine walk.  However, it felt like pulling teeth to get waited on.  It seemed like everyone wanted to eat on the patio.  Since they were so busy, the wait staff was A) clearly under staffed and B) frazzled by the amount of customers.  We got chips, a drink, our order was taken and our food was brought to us.  We didn't see our waitress again until she dropped the check off.  No refills, no extras. Food:  A The chips and salsa were very fresh.  We split the chimchanga with shredded beef and it was delicious.  No complaints in the food department. Ambiance: B- OMG!  It was soooooo hot in this restaurant!  I know we are approaching the heat of the summer.  However, it was hotter inside than it was outside.  My husband ended up asking an employee if there was a problem with the air conditioning.  They blamed it on the front doors being open.  Not sure what the real issue was but my goodness it was hot!  (Maybe that's why everyone wanted to sit outside!)  Other than the heat issue, the décor is typical Mexican restaurant. Price:  Average to inexpensive I love going to Lake Las Vegas...I'm sure we'll try this place again...on a slow night when either the front doors are closed or when we can sit outside."}
{"text":"We are staying at the Hilton Resort and didn't want to drive anywhere for dinner, so we walked down to this place. There were 6 of us and it took a few minutes to seat us, no problem. The waitress asked if we wanted any drinks and two ordered the margaritas, we asked for water and she tried to sell us a $6 bottle of water there on the table, we said no, just regular water would be fine, she then told us it would be $1 for the water? We were a little puzzled and she ended up just giving us the normal ice water in plastic cups.  After the drinks it took about 15 minuets for them to come back and take our food order. It was a Sunday night, but not too busy. It then took over 30 minuets for our food to come to the table. When it did, it wasn't very hot and seemed as if it may have been sitting out for a few minutes. They had forgotten to put guacamole on one of the orders, but one of the waiters brought out a side. The food was average and would have probably given 3 stars if it was hot, not taken so long to get to us and the orders complete, but, alas, that didn't happen."}
{"text":"I love the green, red and white tortilla chips that come complementary.   It was a nice day outside at Lake Las Vegas so we sat out on the patio and enjoyed our meal. The staff were nice and friendly and as soon as we sat down someone was bringing our chips to the table. Once seated we ordered our drinks and placed our food order. I ordered a chicken chimichanga with rice and beans, and my boyfriend ordered a chicken, steak, shrimp, and rice meal that was recommend by the waiter. Our food was delicious and everything was hot and fresh.  If I am every at Lake Las Vegas and I am in the mood for delicious Mexican food I will defiantly return to Sonrisa Grill."}
{"text":"A bit pricey but definitely worth it. Service is decent - food was great! I did see a great football menu - we intended on returning for it and still haven't."}
{"text":"What an amazing experience! We had a large party of about 20ish, Chris was our server and he was incredible! Chanthy the owner came out to greet us and make sure everything was up to par. It was a bit chilly out, so they brought out the standing heaters to accommodate us and make sure we were A-OK!  The restaurant is upscale casual, beautifully decorated (I especially love the fountain in the center of the main dining room & the stained flooring), and it's right next to the lake. Sit outdoors on the patio if you can, very romanitcal.  The food is great, guacamole off the app menu is right up my alley! All in all, we loved our experience and will DEFINITELY go back. Park on the 4th floor of The Hilton's parking garage and walk down the breeze way."}
{"text":"Food isn't bad...  Service is horrible. Came here with about 20 people for a wedding rehearsal dinner and it took hours to get food and drinks. The bride and groom got their food last and it took 3 times for them to make the salmon as requested. The owner came out and said they didn't hear that she wanted it well done but also noted she couldn't make a 3rd one because they already made two.   The food really isn't too bad but the service and timing is off the charts bad. I would look other places for your Mexican fix"}
{"text":"So, when in Vega$ take a trip out to Lake Las Vegas and check out this really relaxing and and off the beaten trail restaurant on the grounds of the Hilton Lake Las Vegas. It was the perfect place for a leasurly afternoon lunch. The patio was awesome and the food even better!   I had the open faced quesadilla and ensalada del la case and Ron had the combo #1. Everything was very flavorful and perfectly portioned.   Service was friendly and attentive, thanks Marcus D!"}
{"text":"My girlfriend and a friend stopped by this place on our first visit to Lake Las Vegas. All the advertisements say it's an oasis, and all the Yelp reviews and other first hand experiences say it's a ghost town....so we had to investigate.   Well, I can confirm, it is a ghost town. We went on a Saturday night, and there actually WERE people. There were even about 4 restaurants open...including this one, but they were all pretty pricey. This one was the only one that was somewhat reasonable, with a 14 dollar quesadilla, so we figured what the heck.  First of all, it's a little awkward. I mean, these restaurants REALLY need your business, and it kind of felt really weird entering into an empty restaurant on a Saturday night trying to check the prices. Since there were no other cheaper choices without leaving the village, and since they were so eager to seat us, we figured what the heck! Why not!  Well, the atmosphere was nice outside on the patio, although the live entertainment down on the lake was pretty terrible. We enjoyed the nice outside space, and we were prepared to enjoy a nice meal at a mexican restaurant.  Then we met our waiter. He was terrible. Seriously, like really bad. The first thing he said to us was \"Would you like a cadillac margarita?\" ...to which we said uh, no, we just sat down and are looking at the menu, can we have some water to start? He then stormed off. Throughout our entire meal, he was the most unfriendly person, and seemed entirely uninterested in dealing with us. My friend ordered a second beer, and no joke, the dude came back literally with his face in a checkbook reading...and slowly (blindly I may add) placed the beer in front of my girlfriend on the other side of the table, and walked away.  Aside from service, the food was alright. My girlfriend and I got quesadillas based on some Yelp reviews, and I would say if you are here and stuck...get them! The quesadillas were actually good, and they were decent sized too. Lots of cheese, how can you mess that up? Also had a nice crispy tortilla. The rice and beans seemed like they had been waiting on a heater awhile to be served, but they were fine.  My friend got a burrito, and he said it was really bad. He didn't finish it.  If it weren't for the waiter, I would probably give this place a 3, but the not great value, terrible waiter, and atmosphere in a weirdly empty town just pushes this down to a 2. By the way, normally I wouldn't mind higher price for a good meal and night out, but all these places are outrageously priced...like it's on the strip. They clearly try to compensate for no customers by jacking up the prices, which drove us away from multiple other restaurants there ironically. Catch 22, need more volume to lower prices, need lower prices for more volume (if there were people around)."}
{"text":"I order the chicken Fajitas, plate came out hot, veggies and chicken were both on point! Side dish of rice, beans, pico de gallo, lettuce, and cheese. Did not come with a side of sour cream or guacamole. I did not notice as the chicken flavor alone was very good.  The veggies mixed with chicken were very good, had mushrooms, which I don't care for but wasn't very much.  My wife had the cheese enchiladas, she enjoys their enchiladas more than any other Mexican restaurant around the Henderson area.   My kids shared quesadillas and fries. The fries seemed ok, the quesadilla was good the cheese is excellent.   Service was par, nothing fantastic.  The environment is cool, music is up beat and can be loud depending on the day you are there.  The bar area is cool, and some nights mostly weekends they have live band or DJ there.  Overall I like this place it's good for the family, and isn't outrageously priced."}
{"text":"The bartenders were friendly and pretty attentive (it was semi slow when we were there, around 3:30pm on a Saturday.) The decor is inviting and colorful which lends itself to the restaurant's name (sonrisa, or smile.)  The margaritas were good though a little on the weak side, but were presented beautifully in traditional Mexican glassware. They serve multi-colored chips and salsa (gratis) which was a nice touch, as we looked through the menu. We ordered guac (decent) followed by the albondiga soup (good, after you add pepper and hot sauce/jalapeños), and the steak/prawn fajitas (smaller portion than we expected, but overall, good, developed flavor). I was a little disappointed that the beans were refried vs traditional black beans - a sign of Tex-Mex restaurant vs. a Mexican one. The food needed a bit more heat (spice profile), but the bartenders were speedy in getting us hot sauce (Tapatio, Cholula) and fresh jalapeños when we requested. We ordered a few rounds of margaritas, all on the rocks. I would be curious to try their frozen version next time, or simply have their draft beer.   Overall, a good, casual Mexican restaurant in  Lake Las Vegas."}
{"text":"First off service wasn't that great.  2nd we weren't done with our appetizer and a random worker came and cleared our table. I told him we weren't done and he just said sorry ! I was annoyed already. Then I show them the \"yelp check in\" it says free house margarita for each adult 21+ he brings back 1 when there was 2 . Took our server 20 min to come back and take out order and still had the nerve to ask if we needed more time lol.... Bartender was my fav . (Husband had to go to bar to order) SAD . other then all that lol... Food was ok. Kinda plain. Chicken flautas were good though ."}
{"text":"Sonrisa is ok, not somewhere I need to go. Nothing really worth eating. It would be so much better if they served better types of Mexican food, like Menudo (on Sundays), chicken mole, tamales, caldo, chili colorado, just to name a few.  I guess if they're catering to the caucasian's, you get what you get.  So because of that, I give it barely 2 stars because they do make good margaritas."}
{"text":"Service was good and they have a decent selection of beer, wine and other cocktails. My dad had some kind of meatball soup and he said it was really good, and he's pretty picky. After drinking beer and eating the delicious chips and salsa I wasn't as hungry as I thought I'd be so I just ordered a side of rice and beans that were very flavorful. If I am ever back in Lake Las Vegas I will definitely stop here for drinks and eats."}
{"text":"Great Happy Hour specials. $3, $4, and $5 happy hour, can't beat that for the prices and we enjoyed the views, service staff, and mostly all the food and drinks. We has the chicken flautas (so freaking yummy that we ordered 3 of those!) the avocado rolls (those were just ok - the bacon over-powered the entire dish that you couldn't taste anything else..granted bacon is great but you lose the taste of the grilled chicken, avocado, and other spices) we also had the baby back ribs (good but not great, the bbq sauce could've been better) the sangria was delis and so was the margarita. we also ordered the carne asada fries (very yummy) and carne asada tacos (this wasn't on the happy hour menu but very good."}
{"text":"Don't come here if you want good food. We left very disappointed. We had halibut tacos, they were bad. They smelled funny so the wife and I didn't eat them because we were scared they would make us sick. Also to note, their rice was borderline cold when served and tasted nothing like Mexican rice I've been eating at most other restaurants. The limes they served with their beer were brown on the edges, not something I like to see.  The food network was here filming for their show the first night we tried going here so after waiting for 1/2hr and they hadn't opened yet we left. Maybe they are trying to save this place?? Its going to need some real help with the horrible food they served us. With the food they served us that night, this will be added to the list of closed up shops in the village at Lake Las Vegas adding to the ghost town."}
{"text":"first let me prefix my review by pointing out that I was there for a catered group dinner so my experience may or may not be normal...  The service was excellent, help was everywhere and no one went hungry or thirsty. The food however left a bit to be desired. I tried a few of the dishes and all felt like they were missing something (flavor mostly). It was all fresh, just not much taste to any of it."}
{"text":"Best Mexican food in Las Vegas! Thank you Chris and his team Myra, Logan , Ivan & Omar for the great service we get from each of you  every time we visit! We Love this place and highly recommend! Nikki & Steve"}
{"text":"I recently visited for Taco Tuesday and thought everything about this spot was A-OK. The restaurant was surprisingly full on a Tuesday night, but we were seated right away.   Everyone in our group ordered from the Taco Tuesday menu. It was very reasonably priced for the all you can eat tacos. Basic meat options for all you can eat were around $11 and it was about $15 for the all you can eat with shrimp and steak. At that pricing I didn't feel the need to overeat.   The service was meh. It wasn't great, but wasn't horrid either. Our waiter didn't come around much, but I guess we didn't need him much since none of us went overboard on the all you can eat.   Both the traditional margarita and the frozen flavored margarita were good. The chips and salsa brought out before the meals was tasty. I tried all five meat and seafood options for the tacos. The prawn was my least flavor as it lacked any real flavor. The carne asada was my favorite flavor. The shredded beef, chicken, and pork were decent. Some fun salsas may have jazzed up the flavors a bit.  In looking at the menu I saw many good options outside of the Taco Tuesday. It looks like they have a solid Happy Hour too. Next visit I'll definitely try something different from the menu."}
{"text":"We can here during the day and found that it was the cutest little place around.  Now mind you that Lake Las Vegas is pretty empty after the Casino left but nonetheless this place was a nice cute breath of fresh air.  The food I found to be very tasty.  The chips came warm and the salsa fresh.  The service was great.  The taco was pretty good.   Not a slam dunk but was good companion with there Margaritas.  The real winner is the decor!  Beautiful.  Having just got back from Spain this place would fit right in there."}
{"text":"Love this place, it's right by the lake and they always have great music and awesome food! The prices are really good and the view is amazing!"}
{"text":"This place is alright. I only gave 2 stars because it's located on the same property as the hotel & I much enjoyed not having to drive for food. Ate here twice, ordered chicken enchiladas both times. Unfortunately got sick the second time. I'm also not a fan of restaurants who put filler veggies in their rice, this place puts corn in theirs. They give you comp chips & salsa however only first bowl is free, 2nd bowl will cost you. Never been to a Mexican restaurant that charges for chips.. The food was ok, but definitely not up to par with the pricing. I could have gone to a cheap Mexican fast food & eaten better food."}
{"text":"Ok, so where to start. The wait staff seemed confused to just get us seated. There was just a wait for everything. Wait to order drinks, wait for the drinks, wait to order food, wait forever to get food, wait for someone to pickup dishes, wait for a beer, wait for the check. The food was subpar at best by the time the food arrived I could tell that it had been sitting under a heat lamp for a while considering that the beans and rice were kinda crusty. Thanks no thanks"}
{"text":"Food was so-so but the service was deplorable. Ordered the all you can eat taco Tuesday deal and after my second order didn't see my server again for over 35 minutes but help made it to all the tables around me 2-3 times in that same time period. Started the meal with no napkin and silverware I had to ask for it. All in all not a great experience."}
{"text":"The margarita tastes like the worst sour mix you can buy mixed with water. I was less than impressed with the margarita.  The food was ok, nothing about what we ordered was delicious.  I am sure there are better Mexican food out there."}
{"text":"Went here while visiting Vegas with some gal pals. Our server was attentive and took great care of us. Their chips and salsa were some of the best chips and salsa I've ever had. The atmosphere is inviting and I had myself a delicious mango margarita, they have so many flavors to choose from! I had a vegetarian plate. Highly recommend if you're in the area! Also they've got such a friendly and attentive staff."}
{"text":"This place is AWESOME and let me tell you why.  First off they have HAPPY HOUR here.  Drinks are $5, and appetizers are reduced all day on Monday and in the after noons Tuesday through Sunday.  Also, Tuesday is Taco Tuesday all day, REALLY???  $11.95 for ALL YOU CAN EAT TACOS....Did you catch that, ALL YOU CAN EAT TACO's.    Now these taco's are are not small taco's, they are filling but you can hang out until they close if you want to eat and drink that long....  The House Margaritas and awesome.  Back to the Taco's, they have shredded chicken, shredded beef, Steak and Prawns and all are WOW.  The Prawns were cooked perfect and were some of the best we have ever had and as for the Steak, the seasoning is heavenly.  If you have not been out to Lake Las Vegas, WHY NOT.  This place is worth the drive and worth the price of the food.  They do have other items on the menu all reasonably priced as compared to other places but the atmosphere is unlike anywhere else, this place is a HIDDEN GEM.  We will be back probably on a Tuesday for the All You Can Eat Taco's along with Happy Hour prices on drinks, a DOUBLE WIN!!!  Omar is an AMAZING bartendar and server.  He has an amazing personality and really makes the entire experience worth coming here."}
{"text":"We were staying at the Westin and decided to wander over to the village to find a place for dinner. First let me say that I'm not a Mexican food connoisseur; I judge the food based not on authenticity but on whether it tastes good - and it definitely did. I had Combo #2 with carne asada enchilada and chile relleno. The steak wasn't the most tender I'd ever had but the flavor was good. Their take on a chile relleno was different than I'd ever had - the relleno was suspended in a cloud of egg white batter, which I enjoyed. One thing I also liked is that their menu is gluten-free friendly in its labeling. Overall, a delicious meal in a nice patio atmosphere."}
{"text":"Last night Eric R. and I visited friends who live in the Lake Las Vegas area.  We walked through the empty bridge that used to belong to the defunct Ritz.  Our friends asked if we liked Mexican, to which I replied, \"It's Eric's favorite!\"  We sat at a large booth, and the staff was very friendly, bringing 2 baskets of chips and 2 salsas for the four of us.  We all had a cold beer, and I definitely appreciate a place that has Dos Equis on tap (lager AND amber)!  I opted for the ceviche tostada appetizer as my meal, and was not disappointed - piled high with citrus spiked shrimp and fish, slices of avocado, quite a bit of heat from diced jalepeno, tomatoes, and a small side salad of mango and carrot.  It was the healthiest possible option at a Mex restaraunt.  Eric R. ordered beef fajitas for himself and enjoyed the big plates of food.  Our friends shared off the menu beef nachos and had enough for 2 more people to eat them probably.  Overall, good service and food, wouldn't rush back to Lake Las Vegas to eat here, but it is a solid choice if you find yourself out there."}
{"text":"I went during their Happy Hour before the Cocktail Walk at Lake Las Vegas.  House Margaritas were $5 and appetizers were buy one get one half off.  This was a great start to an awesome night.  I went with low expectations based on the poor reviews from yelp.  But maybe this place turned it around because the service was EXCELLENT.  My group took advantage of Happy Hour and had the cheese dip, avocado rolls, and quesadilla.  Everything was really freaking good and they had a great selection of Mexican beers on draft.  I was impressed by the selection of vegetarian entrees.  I ordered the broccoli enchiladas and chile relleno.  The food was fresh and full of flavor. I would totally go back.  So, if you are reading these reviews and are on the fence about trying this place out -  I wholeheartedly recommend this restaurant.  The prices are bit high, but if you go during Happy Hour, it is definitely worth the price."}
{"text":"We ate there last night and the food was excellent! The salsa is one of the best I have had at a restaurant like this. The food was delicious, it was properly timed (in terms of courses). Despite being very busy, our waiter was excellent and the staff was appropriate at checking in on us and quick to bring more salsa/drinks. My boyfriend said several times that this was one of the best Mexican meals he has ever had. I don't know if I agree with that, mostly because I have had too many good Mexican meals...but it definitely was excellent and tasty and I would love to eat here again. The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars: the hostess was a little curt and had a bit of an attitude. She said there was an hour wait (which we understood and were OK with), made it sound like our request to be seated inside was something she probably wouldn't try to do, and said she would call us when a table opened up. An hour later we returned to find our name crossed off. She said she tried to call but it didn't work. My phone was with me and on the entire time we waited. I was receiving emails at that time too so i know it had service. I checked the number she had and it was right. I am thinking she didn't call...despite that little issue I would recommend this place."}
{"text":"Service could use much improvement.  For a place like this in the village they should allow pets on the patio. (We didn't have our dog with us) and if you're serving on the patio- they should have the heaters working. Especially during the holidays. Food was ok."}
{"text":"Great food and great service! Street tacos were awesome, Fajita to die for and the place looks great with great views. 5 stars!"}
{"text":"This restaurant is decent. We decided to dine here right as the beer festival was ending, so it was extremely convenient. Of course, so did myriad other patrons. Understandably, there was a little wait for a table but not bad at all.  Unfortunately, I can't say the same for the wait for the food. I understand they were busy. I'll forgive them. When we did get our meals, they tasted good. Nothing extraordinary here, but a decent meal to cap our evening.  They had a DJ playing some nice old school beats. That may or may not be your thing, but I enjoyed it. Oh and by checking in on Yelp, you get a free house margarita. To be honest, it was bland."}
{"text":"UPDATE! Dogs still NOT allowed...even Service Animals.  My wife and niece stopped by for some tacos with our service dog and the manager said \"no,\" though she did not mention she had a service animal. This is NOT a dog friendly establishment. The managers of Mimi & Cocos, Proof and The Pub, all, said our dogs are more than welcome...service animals or not. We are locals, with small dogs, like many locals in LLV. Sonrisa has made their stand that \"we are not welcome.\" So, tonight, on Taco Tuesday at Sonrisa, we drove 18 minutes to Lindo Michaoca to enjoy a REAL Mexican dinner overlooking the Strip and mountains, with a lovely sunset. If you do not live in LLV do NOT waste your time driving out to LLV to eat expensive boiled chicken tacos. If you're coming out here, try the three I mentioned above and get better quality food. The only thing we liked about Sonrisa was the convenience of driving 2 minutes and sitting outside. Well, after our lovely experience at Lindo, we have a NEW home with a much better atmosphere and, especially, FOOD! Alienating locals LLV residents, with small dogs, will only lead to their demise....AND if I, a local LLV resident, refuses to patronize this place, you should question your choice, as well. And don't forget...do NOT bring your dogs! you will be turned away. Bon Appetite!"}
{"text":"Visiting from Vancouver, WA - we landed here craving good and authentic Mexican food.... our hotel was on the same property so our initial thought was to simply try it out and turn in for the night. Man oh Man! This food from salsa to chips started off BANGING!! ABSOLUTELY the best salsa I have had in years. I ordered the chicken chimichanga and my boyfriend had a beef burrito... we inhaled every last bite and was stunned at how DELICIOUS everything was. I will definitely come back next time I am in Nevada.  Regardless if I am staying at the Hilton hotel, on the strip or wherever! Love, love, love."}
{"text":"We were told when we made our reservations that they probably wouldn't be necessary which proved to true.  There was a free concert by Genevieve on the green that evening so the terrace was full, but the dining room was empty with the exception of one other table.  The restaurant itself is beautiful, but I doubt overhead expenses are covered except on weekends.  The waitress asked if we wanted guacamole with our chips and we responded affirmatively.  The guacamole was very good and we were amazed that it was complimentary since other restaurants charge $6-10 per order.   The restaurant serves both traditional Tex-Mex dishes and \"fresh\" seafood entrees.  We each chose the \"fresh\" halibut in spinach cream sauce which was accompanied by chipotle mashed potatoes, green beans and carrots.  The halibut was overcooked and I was surprised, but shouldn't have been, to find a $6 charge for the guacamole included on our bill."}
{"text":"I couldn't enjoy my meal for all the damn flies trying dine with us. I don't know if they always leave the doors open. But, during my visit it was a complete nuisance."}
{"text":"I had met some friend 2 weeks ago, great food and service, they also have a great Happy Hour."}
{"text":"Camarones were excellent-garlic sauce incredible - thanks for the recondition - Logan our server. Chile Relleno was delicious. Not too saucy. Margaritas were comped as part of this check in - of course we upgraded to Cadillac for just a bit more. Prices are a bit high but it is a resort so not too bad. I would come back for sure.  Service was great and we had a lake view."}
{"text":"Even though it was my mistake of going for the patio seating when it was almost 100 degrees outside, the seating out there was so uncomfortable! The tables were so much higher than the chairs it was very awkward and I was uncomfortable and hot the whole time. I ordered the chicken flautas and they were so good! Our server was also very quick and attentive even though he was the only server out on the patio. May return again but I'll def ask to be seated inside next time. The view of the lake was nice but not worth being uncomfortable."}
{"text":"My girlfriend lives in Lake Las Vegas and we wanted something close by. PS-there isn't much, let alone on a week day. The area is a ghost town, we were SO thankful this place was even open!  To start, the chips and salsa were delicious. Not only were they hot and fresh, the salsa tasted home-made-yuMMMMMMMMy! Did I mention how fresh the salsa tasted? I ordered the shredded beef quesadilla and it came with beans and rice (price was $13.95). The quesadilla had a lot of flavor. Cheese, beef and green chilies (not hot) were oozing out of the crisp tortilla. I was actually quite impressed and after all was said and done an didn't mind the cost for something that would normally be cheaper. I would definitely go back again if I was in the area.  Close, fresh and tasty!"}
{"text":"My husband and I stopped here for lunch at random, and our experience started off well enough with rather addicting chips and salsa.  We ordered a queso dip as well for them, which made them that much munchier.  However, with the exception of their signature margarita (which was quite lovely), nothing else managed to bump the star rating for us.  We both ordered the chicken chimichanga.  It was edible, but no where near worth what we paid for them.  And they were FULL of cheese.  A good thing you'd think, right?  Not this time, it was overkill.   The most disappointing thing though was the general lack of attention to detail in cleanliness.  The tables had bits of... stuff still on them, as did the base of the spiral-stand that held our chips.  The floors were dirty.  And my husband discovered a stack of fossilized Mexican-food crumbs pressed in between the seat cushions of the booth.  A shame, because at first glace it looks like an awesome little place.  We'll probably not make this decisions again, unless we're just after drinks and chips."}
{"text":"Ate here for happy hour yesterday while staying at the Hilton next door. Great happy hour selection. Wife and I tried a few things. All of it was excellent and service was tremendous. We walked out totally stuffed for under $40 with 2 Sangrias."}
{"text":"Most horrible food I think I have ever had..... tacos literally had 0 flavor, was clearly just unseasoned boiled chicken. ::gag:: 2 bites and pushed the plate away."}
{"text":"Wonderful! Delicious food, great service and amazing desserts. The salsa was fresh, ceviche was prepared properly and the enchiladas were authentic. Portions are smaller than average but we appreciated the attention to quality."}
{"text":"In the middle of ghost town with no where else to go (and the closest McDonalds 30 mins away) this place hit the spot. It's a basic Mexican restaurant with an awesome happy hour and good food. I've experienced the bar and wait staff, and both are helpful and quick in providing service. No complaints here."}
{"text":"Really enjoyed the food and our waitress! The only reason I gave it 4 stars was that it was a bit too pricey. Other than that, a great place and I recommend to anyone!"}
{"text":"Good food at a good price.    We rolled by during taco tuesdays.  All you can eat tacos for a reasonable price ($12 I think).  This restaurant has different specials every day of the week.  Most of the area was a ghost town though.  Apparently, once the casino closed businesses started closing down.  They do have events on the weekend, but our work schedule doesn't allow for me to roll by.  Food came out fast and we left full."}
{"text":"We had dinner here on Friday night.  No waiting, the place wasn't dead, but there were only a couple of tables.  A few more people came as we were leaving.  It looks like they have a solid patio, but it was pretty cold so it was not in use.  We'll return when it's warmer and sit outside.  To start, we had the cheese dip.  This was a winner, and very reasonably priced.  I had mixed grill fajitas, which was a miss.  I didn't care for the seasoning, it had something I can't put my finger on, but it created an odd taste.  My wife had a beef chimichanga, which was excellent.  Frying things, such as a burrito, is usually a good idea, and this was no exception.  The portions were quite large, we had a lot to take home.  Service was above average, our drinks were never close to empty, but our server did not hover over us.  We will return, but I won't get fajitas next time..."}
{"text":"Chips and salsa are wowsers! Margaritas are perfect. Flan is smooth, creamy, and deeelicioso."}
{"text":"Good flavor, but my food was cold. Server didn't come back for a long time to check in or I would have asked for a warm up. Nice view and ambience."}
{"text":"Food is delicious, but my dates meal arrived 30+ minutes after mine and the waitress kept saying it would be there soon. It really put a damper on the evening and they tried to make up for it but serving my dish 30+ minutes before hers was very unprofessional, not to mention the lack of urgency once it was brought to their attention. It was a very busy night, but I definitely expected more. Our first visit was completely different, albeit a lunch time affair."}
{"text":"Great Mexican restaurant. Worth the drive out to lake Las Vegas. Food is consistently good and service is as well."}
{"text":"Slow and terrible service, food was very poor quality & brought us the wrong order, definitely won't be returning when there's much better Mexican food all over Henderson."}
{"text":"This is a scary place if your kid has a food allergy.    What we liked.   Fun atmosphere and decent food.   What we didn't like was the service.   Waitress was super dismissive and not caring when we expressed our son has serious food allergies when we were ordering.   Then one of her teammates proceeded to plate an adult food in front of our son with one of his allergens in it.   When we said that was not ok,  she got super defensive and was not at all apologetic.   Had no idea she almost sent our son to the hospital and didn't really seem to care or express any remorse."}
{"text":"Sonrisa Grill is one of my best find yet. Food is delicious and the drinks will knock you down. BUT the staff, that's where they lack service.  The Hostess (long blond hair) is very unfriendly and no where to be found to seat you. The waiters look at you and ignore you when standing at the door.  When finally seated the waiter/waitress take a long time to greet you. They seldom check up on you and never ask if you need anything else.    I've been to this place 6 times so far in April.  Awesome food, lazy service."}
{"text":"In Henderson for a lacrosse tournament and found this place on the yelp. Great chilli relleno.  Little ways out of the way but food was fantastic, service was excellent.  Save room for fried ice cream.  Ok 5 stars. Fun little resort village, I'm sure we'll come back when we're back for another tourny."}
{"text":"I've only tried one dish (carne asada tacos), and they were much better than average. The seasonings and spices were great, and the tortillas perfectly done (seems so simple, but so often it's not). The meat was a little on the tough/overdone side. The atmosphere/view/location can't be beat and the service was exceptional"}
{"text":"Happened to be Cinco de Mayo when we visited and they go ALL OUT! Live mariachi bands, traditional dancers, bounce house for the kids. Super tasty good and good service too. Can't speak to the margaritas as I was here with just my toddler (who had a blast!) but they sure looked yummy ;)"}
{"text":"I highly recommend checking this place out. The staff is very friendly especially Ivan and Jessica. I had such a great meal as well as excellent service. My drinks were so good that I didn't want to leave. I met a few locals here and they told me that they come here often because of the good food and service. I could tell by my friend wanting to come here that I would like it. Actually love it .!!! Well enjoy a good drink and see Ivan at the bar. You will love it !"}
{"text":"Went here for the first time for Memorial Day dinner. Was a little apprehensive given all the recent negative reviews, but decided to give it a shot anyway ... and everything was fine, I enjoyed my meal and I was glad I ate here.  Service: perfectly fine, no complaints at all. Including timeliness; no unusual waits to get seated or to get our food. Chip refills were offered multiple times, and they didn't charge us for refills.  Food: It was great. Maybe not the greatest i've ever had, but there wasn't anything wrong with it.  I went around 5 or 5:30, the game was on, and there was a decent number of customers. Observed some good teamwork with the employees, they were cleaning up a mess from a previous party with messy kids that had just left; another employee appeared saying \"let me take over on clean up so you can get the customers seated.\""}
{"text":"Friendly bar staff made for a great afternoon luncheon. Nice selection of beer, mixed drinks and wine with a view overlooking Lake Las Vegas.  We had a tostada salad with shredded chicken and a taco platter with one chicken and one carnitas taco complete with rice and black beans.  Not a bad spot in the up and coming section of Lake Las Vegas."}
{"text":"Had excellent enchiladas here and the blackened ahi salad was crisp and cool and fresh. Sat on the patio and enjoyed the live music.  Had no problem with service or length of wait as some others have. Our server was attentive and the ambience was lovely. The kids meals are $7 with the bean and cheese burrito being their favorite. Will come back if I'm ever in Lake Las Vegas again."}
{"text":"Went here for taco Tuesday , waited literally an hour just for 3 beef shredded tacos ( It wasn't even that busy) our server (I forgot to asked for his name) was really nice and the food was great. Just the wait pretty much ruined my first experience. Would go back and try again but not anytime soon"}
{"text":"Crappy food, worse service. If you're staying in Lake Las Vegas your options are limited. Good luck"}
{"text":"This place is always a favorite of mine. Having lived in lake Las Vegas since 2006, the entire team at Sonrisa has always been attentive to all guests and their needs.   They have amazing wines and margaritas. Chanthy the owner is always greeting and making sure her guests are satisfied.  Omar, the bartender and the rest of the team are so fun and really pay attention to your needs.  Camarones mojo de ajo is an awesome dish! Taco Tuesday is fun too and weekends they have a DJ!"}
{"text":"We came out for Taco Tuesday.  There was a group of 12 of us and the restaurant still had some open seats.  It took 45 minutes to get our first order of Taco's.  While the food was good and the server felt bad they should have had a better grasp on getting the food out the door faster to the tables (everything on the tacos is the same and can be pre done except the meat)."}
{"text":"Waited 10 minutes before anyone even acknowledged that we were waiting to be seated.  Finally got a seat outside - which is beautiful.  Fun festive lights - great view.  We were a party of 6 - and the hostess said I only have 3 menus - ill bring you more later - she never came back.  We asked a bus person for extra menus - he came back 10 minutes later.  We got quick service for our drink order - but got serverd in styrafome cups...really?? I looked around and there were some  tables with glasss - and some with styrafome like us.  Took a looooong time to get our food - 45 minutes.  After the food arrived -  the hostess comes back with extra menus - ?? Couldnt she see we had food at our table??  I ordered Albondigas soup - which was just warm - and tasted like tomato soup with frozen meatballs. We had a mexican salad - which was horrible - just shredded lettuce - with nothing mexican about it.  Got our bill - and they had the nerve to actualy charge an automatic 18% gratuity because we were a party of 6.  Never again!!!"}
{"text":"The ambiance of Lake Las Vegas resort is good as always. We stopped here after riding our motorcycles around the lake mead national recreational area; it's been a beautiful day. The restaurant is good and seemed to be the only offering with flavor in LLV. We ordered the Paella Sonrisa and Caldo de siete mare. Both were good but the Paella was a little heavy on the salt. Service here is on the slow side but I liked it. It's supposed to slow down your pace. Enjoy the view! Yelp offered $2 off any margarita but we didn't take it. They have live music in the evening so we may return another time when in the area. In general this  is a nice restaurant for lake Las Vegas but when compared to offerings in vegas then maybe a 3 star. The food and resort ambiance are good."}
{"text":"It was a slow afternoon for either a very late lunch or early dinner. Service was wonderful and prompt. The food tasted very good and I will have to return."}
{"text":"My wife and I love this place.  The food is always good and the service has been great.  We love how friendly and inviting the restaurant is.  Table side guac is a great addition to their menu.  The happy hour specials are great too.  We have had a lot of different items on their menu and our favorite is the fajitas.  They are fresh, well prepared, and the rice, beans, lettuce, cheese, and pico that comes with it are fantastic.  The sangria is amazing.  Keep up the good work!"}
{"text":"I went there for lunch today and the food was very well prepared. I had the #2 combination plate and upgraded to the shrimp enchilada which was very well proportioned with shrimp. The food was very tasty but unfortunately I could not really enjoy it because there was no air conditioning and probably close to a 100 degrees in the restaurant. Unfortunately they share underground coolants system for their air conditioning which was not working at the time. Having owned and managed a restaurant in the past I know for a fact that the cost of a 16 oz soft drink is less than a nickel. It is my belief that providing free soft drinks during these times where there is no air conditioning and very uncomfortable would go a long way towards making it a pleasure bless for the customers. There were only six patrons with 2 of them were drinking alcohol in the entire restaurant so the cost of the free soft drinks would have been about a quarter  per round but would go a long way towards promoting Goodwill in a very uncomfortable situation. That is why such a low rating was goven because management was not thoughtful of their patrons. What should have been a enjoyable time wasn't!!"}
{"text":"I was staying at the neighboring hotel for work and stumbled upon this restaurant and I am happy I did! We sat outside and were instantly served chips and salsa (the salsa is amazing!!) and our margaritas came quickly after. The food is great for the location! I am from So Cal so I have high expectations of Mexican food. I would definitely return when I visit the lake again."}
{"text":"Our first visit out to Lake Las Vegas and we stumbled upon this restaurant so we decide to eat dinner. The hostess was a bit scattered and inattentive. Our server was worse. Took at least 15 minutes to get our drinks brought to the table. We ordered a taco dinner plate that comes with rice and beans. For $13.95....there were Literally 2 bites (fork full) of rice on the plate. We asked the waiter if this was the usual amount and he resoundingly said Yes!  We said for $13.95 that's ridiculous. So he brought a small plate out with more. A little while later we saw him doing the same thing to another table--bringing them more rice too. On a side note there was an on-duty employee who was drinking on her break (poured a Corona beer into a red solo cup right in front of us)...then sat and ate....I thought she was break but No....she kept getting up and checking on her tables!!!  We wanted to ask our waiter for more Soda because he never once came back by our table to check our drinks or refill them. We had to interrupt his conversation with he hostess to get his attention. Then again we waited. And waited to get our check. Again we had to ask. Luckily we weren't in a hurry to go anywhere. But this place just felt like the employees were doing Whatever they wanted (like there was no manager on duty). We liked the food, but for the price the portions were small and service was negligible.  They need to act like a food critic could be coming anytime--not like when the Manager is away the employees will just zone off."}
{"text":"Worst restaurant in such a great location. We had a party of 20 people, had a reservation set and they were not prepared at all. My husband and I ordered some appetizers to split, super pricey by the way and not worth it. Carne asada fries to them have nacho cheese sauce drizzled all over cold French fries. The carne was good and that's the only thing good about that appetizer. The nacho cheese was so thick and cols, it was very unappetizing. Our other items never came out. My brothers food was cold, my sister in law who is 9 months pregnant had a cold quesadilla. We finally got a hold of the waitress and said we ordered 2 other items, and he comment was \"do you want them off the bill??\" Not \"oh sorry, let me see what happened\" or anything along those lines. Our bill for my husband and I was $40. I had a Cadillac margarita, my husband had a Pacifico and we had the carne asada fries appetizer. Not at all worth it and I'm so sad my grandma had her 70th birthday here. We will never EVER come back and I don't understand why this place thinks they can charge as much as they do for the small business they receive here. We had a better time other places in the area"}
{"text":"I went to the Sonrisa Grill to have a casual day at Lake Last Vegas. I went on a Sunday and according to the web site it was Sangria Sunday. $5 for a glass. I got there just after they opened. I wasn't busy. I was seated and the chips and salsa came out right away. They were pretty good. I was looking at the drink menu for the sangria special. I didn't see it. When my waiter came and I asked him about it and he confirmed the they had it. I ordered one but I hate it when restaurants do not publish their specials and have to ask for it. If you don't they charge full price.  My drink came and I knew already what I wanted to order as I looked at the menu before I arrived. It was Chile relleno. My response from my waiter \"we don't have any\". WHAT??? You are a freaking Mexican restaurant. You just opened and you don't have Chile rellenos. I ordered the overpriced chicken fajitas. It was ok but not what I wanted. I may be back but I won't make a special trip to do so."}
{"text":"Oh dear...  The only reason this place has any stars is because the staff is STELLAR.  Food is okay. There is no variety, nothing special. Everything is clean. Atmosphere would be AWESOME if this town had any population.  And the staff is wonderful.  But there's no one here... How is this place still open? I guess it's a good place to get weird!"}
{"text":"Well I'm sure they have to be better than this but I have been sitting in the outdoor patio area for about 15 minutes and nobody has come out here not to clean up not to pick up the checks that were cleared nor to ask me if I would like to order something it is happy hour time but I don't see that many people inside so I am pretty peeved that they don't even bother to look outside. Ok update: So just now someone came outside and asked me if I was okay. Thank God that one person noticed finally. Christopher came out and gave very friendly accurate attentive service. He saved this review from being 2 stars"}
{"text":"This is a Mexican restaurant with a short selection of Mexican dishes, they offer a live music on Friday and Saturday but they put a waitress as a DJ just to change music without talk, they offer a special on drinks late Friday but is not true they double-the price, the most important is the taste of the food and honestly taste like a box food with a enchiladas can sauce, definitely is not a Mexican food just the color of the inside and some music the they played, otherwise is a very expensive place"}
{"text":"If having a day trip to Lake Las Vegas this is the place to try and have a carne asada and it's not complete without a fried ice cream and these amazing xangos which are fried cheesecake its like nothing you'll ever had before and must try if going here."}
{"text":"Nice place, nice busser BUT OUR SERVER IS HORRIBLE!!! First we ask her about our yelp offer we got for checking in with YELP and she said the FREE HOUSE MARGARITA is only a tasting cup size not a full order! Then the busser show up and we ask him about it after he drop off our drinks order and he said wait that doesn't sound right let ask the manager then he came back and said it is a full size margarita order. Then we order our food, portion is very small compare to other happy hours food places we been. Then the worst part is while we still eating the chips and shrimp ceviche the server took our chips and leave us the shrimp ceviche without any chips left to eat it with!!! This is very sad first time we visited this restaurant and SADLY TO SAY THIS IS OUR LAST VISIT HERE!!!   Server name is: Susana  Busser name: Matthew (excellent customer service!)"}
{"text":"Sonrisa can provide you with a pretty ordinary margarita but at least it comes stat.  My lack luster review can be blamed on the avocado rolls.  If you put the ingredient name into the name of the dish it should be front and center not just a sliver draped over a deep fried roll whose contents cannot be determined because it was blended to a baby food consistency mush.  Perhaps I was just unlucky in my selection so all I can say is if you go don't order this appetizer because it is anything but."}
{"text":"I read the reviews but we decided to try anyway.  Very disappointed!  The restaurant was more re crowded than I thought it would be, I hoped that was a good sign. Service was ok, dinner was tasteless and disappointing.  I had the avocado rolls and a salad.  The rolls were ok.  My husband had chicken and steak fajitas-they were bland and underwhelming.  Try one of the other open restaurants in the village before going here!"}
{"text":"Hate to leave a bad review but the food here kind of ruined our last vacation day. Rice and beans seemed like they were re-heated, carne asada burrito and skirt steak had too much sauce and made my boyfriend and I kind of sick. Also, maybe put the supplies away that were upstairs, made the place seem unorganized."}
{"text":"Good food and great atmosphere.  Service was nice and it was a gorgeous day for a regatta!"}
{"text":"Our favorite local Mexican food! I'm always craving their chicken tacos and green sauce enchiladas... Yum! Sitting on the patio with a skinny margarita is one of our favorite ways to spend a Saturday afternoon in Lake Las Vegas  Their staff is always so friendly and they even do a locals discount. Thanks Sonrisa for all the good times and great food."}
{"text":"Over priced , slow service, poor food quality. The only good thing here was the Corona beer and the Mints you get on the way out."}
{"text":"One of the worst experiences. The place is busy because is 1 out only 3 places that serve food at the Lake. Our experience:  The hostess walked us to our table and they had not cleaned it prior to our arrival. After being seated and more than half an hour later, we were forgotten; no one came to take our orders or gave us water. I had to ask for someone to take our order. When we got our drinks, all the glasses were not washed appropriately; they had water stains, fiber hairs all over, and stains on the exterior part from being handle with dirty hands. The food was good, but I got a stomach ache after seeing an insect in between my rice. To top it off when I got my check, I almost fell back. They are over priced. When I went to the bathroom, I noticed their cleaning supplies were under the sink in plain view. I couldn't help thinking- this is dangerous. Specially because there are a lot of kids that can get harmed by this.   I believe this place has potential, but they need to get their shit together."}
{"text":"The waiter spilled an entire tray of waters on us, the floor, and our table. He apologized and cleaned it up but no manager or supervisor ever came over to see if everything was ok. It was 100 degrees today in Vegas and they had all the doors open with no air conditioner. It was almost a relief to have cold water spilled on me. The food was average, nothing special. I wouldn't waste the drive."}
{"text":"We had a party of 30 (yes, you read that right), because a friend was getting married at the Westin. We asked them if they could fit us in around 7:30, and they were able to get us all a table together in about 15 minutes. The margaritas were DELICIOUS, $10 each for a fruit flavor. The food was decently priced for being in a resort area, about $13-$15 per plate. I got a soft taco/enchilada combo and my husband got a steak burrito. Both were excellent. Would eat here again if I was staying in LLV."}
{"text":"Came here on Valentine's Day. We arrived around 5 before the rush and was immediately sat on the patio. The female hostess only brought 1 menu for 3 of us. It was a special Vday menu with only about 10 items. After asking for another menu and waiting we finally ordered.  Then the wait begins! It took almost 40 minutes for our appetizers to arrive.  Cheese Dip and Guac. Then we had to ask for refills of chips and drinks. Our waiter apologized and said the Kitchen was backed up. We noticed he was busy running back to the kitchen all the time. NOT really sure how a kitchen could be backed up with a limited menu and we arrived before the rush. They were getting busy as we left.  So after an hour and 20 minutes our fajitas arrived. The chicken was good. Nothing special and the beans and rice on a separate plate was cold. It wasn't served with any Sour Cream or Guac?? I'm giving 3 stars because the ambience. It was a gorgeous night. They had a guitar player and the patio is great.  They really need to step up their game to be \"it\" place that I would want to drive to."}
{"text":"Skirt steak was yummy! The portion was huge, perfectly cooked and had sides of rice & beans. I don't think there was any fat at all!  Their salsa is very tasty. The bar is well stocked, especially with many brands of tequila!  They were featuring 2 Maui Brewing varieties in cans, and I had the Coconut Porter, which is just as good outside of the island! The patio was busy, as it was a rare, not sizzling hot August evening!  I like this place though I don't get out to the Lake much anymore. Sonrisa has a lot of happy hour and other daily deals, like AYCE Taco Tuesdays, that are worth making the trip for!"}
{"text":"Wondered in here after an event and wanted to grab a drink and ended up getting the best drink and the best service I've gotten in a really long time. The bartender Omar suggested that I try the Herradura Ultra Añejo so he made me a Paloma even thought they were out of grapefruit soda, He Made Some ! The service and knowledge of the tequilas are great, come out at get this Paloma, for real."}
{"text":"The hostess was awesome! I can't remember her name but she was the best! She took a moment to step out to point out the parking garage; I was so lost. Food was delicious and very reasonably priced. Waiter was fantastic. Thank heavens this restaurant was open and fully functioning; considering most of everything was shutdown in The Village at the Las Vegas Lake."}
{"text":"Early lunch brought us to this cozy little restaurant. Party of 5. If you opt outdoor seating you get a great view of the lake.  The traditional salsa and chips to start. Great use of color with the chips. The salsa didn't seem to have any kick to it. I ordered a wet bean and cheese chimichanga. It could have use some spices, salt and pepper. Other than that it was fresh and hot. It took way too long for our food to come out. 4 of the five guest was served first and about 3 minutes later the last entree was brought out. We waited for over a half an hour. The patio emptied and I almost feared they forgot about us. Maybe they did... In their defense it was a busy day, still almost unbearable. Our waitress could have done a bit better with communication. That could have eased the wait. Also she dropped the check and some random server retrieved it. There may have possibly been a shift change.  I liked, not loved the food. I loved the location, the service needs some work. The location will bring me back..."}
{"text":"Fresh food that is really good for the most part. Over-prices; they charge for chips and salsa after they make a big deal out giving you a \"free first round\". I've never seen a Mexican restaurant charge for chips and salsa, kinda nickel and dimming customers while making them think they're being generous (maybe they had a bad experience with salsa and chip hoarders...). Service is pretty bad. The outdoor ambience is really the best thing about this place; that could also be because there really isn't anything else opened out at Lake Las Vegas."}
{"text":"Came around 11 am on a Saturday. We were seated and ordered quickly, but it fell apart after that. They were some how out of flautas, so I had to change my order. 2 people in my party ordered a la carte tacos, but were served full meals. The waiter assured us they would only be charged for the tacos, fine. My soup was never brought out and we had to ask them to take it off the bill. I ordered tacos, and instead of the meal, was brought a la carte tacos. I asked for cilantro and onion and only got onion. It was just kind of a mess. The food was good enough but over priced and the service was sub par. Disappointing."}
