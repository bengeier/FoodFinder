{"text":"We will definitely be coming back. The owner was incredible and hospitable and definitely took care of us and our 2 year old!"}
{"text":"I was stoked to find out that Island Style expanded to Number 2 located at Greenland. The original restaurant is a little far from where I live. Always on the hunt for the best Hawaiian food this is definitely a go to spot. We always order the meat combo with kalbi, meat jun and chicken. I love their meat jun sauce. I always get the fried saimin too. Yummy!!! The portions are pretty big. The customer service is excellent. The one man that is from Hawaii is always super nice and goes out of his way to accomadate your order and then some. He noticed I injured my finger and without asking he hooked me up with a bag of ice. He also gave us additional rice at no charge. You can't beat the Hawaiian spirit no matter where you live."}
{"text":"We love the Greenland Market and we were surprised to find Island Style 2. We have family from Hawaii and visit often. The owner expressed the true Aloha spirit and the food was onolicious. We enjoyed the spam musubi, fried hot dogs and side dishes. He even gave us boiled peanuts, a true island favorite.  Many mahalos and a hui hou.."}
{"text":"Just found this place in Greenland supermarket and it is great find! Local Hawaiian food and authentic Korean food! I'm Korean-American and my husband is from the islands. My kids loved the spam musubi ($2.50) Owner says he gets the noodles from Hawaii. Seaweed soup is delicious. Ban chans are tasty and well made. Owner is very friendly and from Hawaii. Price is great!"}
{"text":"The Best Beef Rib Soup ever!!!. 10. It's a hearty, nourishing soup with a delicate flavor. Try it!!!!"}
{"text":"first of all im going to cry the owner is so nice he gave us water and extra side dishes and even put away our plates and gave us hot tea and watermelon and checked up on us and was so nice like the father i wish i had. 


also the beef kaibi was super good and tender"}
{"text":"Located in food court of Greenland Supermarket. This place is so conveniently close to work, love coming here to get our Korean food fix on lunch breaks! Especially love coming for the meat jun & fried saimin. Russel is so welcoming, spreads aloha & provides the best service! You won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"This place is so good!!!! The BBB is so delicious & Russ has the absolute best customer service I've ever seen. He always goes out of his way to accommodate his guests."}
{"text":"Friendly owners and the food is amazing. The food comes out fast and is always delicious. My go to Meat Jun spot."}
{"text":"Nestled snugly in the Greenland food court, Island Flavor 2 showcases an interesting blend of Korean and Hawaiian cuisine. For this trip, I ordered the $10.95 Spam and eggs breakfast meal, and with it came seawood soup, two kinds of kim chi, sliced hot dogs, and a curious vegetable dish coated with mayonnaise. 

You need only know that the food was made with absolute care, thought, and love. The middle-aged gentleman who took my order appeared to not look very Korean but dutifully carried out the continuous, foreign marching orders barked out by the nice Korean lady who split half her time in the restaurant stand and the other half with a table full of customers who were potentially chatting about this weirdo at the next table over, snapping photos of his lunch from various angles while leaving this here review.

The side dishes came out first and were crisp and flavorful. Standard Korean fare but at least here one can be assured that none are recycled--dishes are returned to a communal dish-return stand shared by the entire food court. The eggs were a perfect over easy, the Spam hot and crisp, and the rice poofed into a pleasantly fluffy cloud of carby goodness that offset perfectly the salinity of the meat.

While I can perhaps vaguely understand that Spam is not a universal favorite, the blessed union between yolk and short-grain rice here is undeniably, universally awe-inspiring and is akin to having the sensation of slow, sensual love-making in one's mouth. Mix with the provided kim-chi for an extra kick, if desired."}
{"text":"Terrific service!!! First time here & definitely coming back. The owners were very friendly! Love it here & their food is amazing."}
{"text":"Used to go to the original one on Sahara, but now come to this location because it's closer and Russ makes you feel like you're family at dinner at home! Great food and customer service!"}
{"text":"This place hits the spot when you're homesick for some good Hawaii style Korean food! Kalbi soup, meat jun, spam fried rice, Mac salad, kimchee...all of it was super delish. Not to mention the good old island style aloha, Uncle at the counter makes you feel like ohana. Since we frequent Greenland Market, this will be a frequent stop for us too!"}
{"text":"They are back!! Same food same great service just back at Greenland Market Place. Russell at the front of the house same great personality serving up great portions of local Hawaiian favorites favorites and Korean food.. one of the few places in Las Vegas that make Bi Bim Kook Soo. I haven't had a bad meal in the 18 years that I've been visiting Island Style."}
{"text":"Uncle Russell and his lovely & beautiful wife are awesome!! They re-opened this 2nd location in July 2017 and I didn't know?! Well I'm so so happy and excited that they are back and I can pick up food on my way to work!!! Meat Jun, Kim Chee fried rice, their side dishes and fried saimin is the BOMB and ON POINT !!! Thank you for the great service and delicious food and I will keep on coming back for more. My Ohana loves this place so on. Y next visit we will all be back."}
{"text":"I've been searching for a good bibimbap aside from KoMex, and this is it. Better even. Great customer service and the portions were generous. Quality was really bomb too.

They have squid too which is interesting as I've never had a squid bibimbap. Have to try next time."}
{"text":"So today i went and ate at island style 2 i ordered a meat juhn plate it was delicious and the owner was so nice offering us all kinds of pupu while we wait for our food must say it was worth the drive 5 star in my book"}
{"text":"Combo plate is the way to go. You ain't from Hawai'i if you don't remember meat jun, bbq chicken, and kalbi. The guy who took my order very welcoming and he offered me some soup while I was waiting for my food. The customer service was amazing and it reminded me of the warm aloha feeling that I get back home. I will definitely be back. For those of you who are curious this location is in the Korea town plaza food court. They also have another location on sahara"}
{"text":"We usually patronize Island Style on Sahara for their Jajangmyeon (Korean style black bean noodle) and thought #2 would serve the same and they don't.  Since we are already there we might as well eat.  My companion ordered a bowl of Saimin and I ordered Loco Moco from the counter.  A short while after we sat down, a very polite gentleman brought us 3 good size dishes of kim chees and Korean white seaweed salad along with 2 cups of hot tea.   He even came back with another dish of kim chee when he noticed we finished the first one.  My companion told me the Saimin's broth tasted like their kitchen actually prepared a real broth and not out of a can of Swanson chicken broth.  I know there's not much to a plate of Loco Moco but I felt satisfy with what this joint served.  The macaroni salad was light and tasty.  Most Island food joints tend to serve heavier version.  We really enjoyed the kim chee they serve here.  I wish they would sell a jar of that stuff to go. Now that we experienced great service and good food here, we will have to split our visits between this place and the one at Sahara."}
{"text":"Luv da food. My go to plates (meat jun and the combo plates).  Sides are great. Thanks for having this location. Will try the bibimbap next"}
{"text":"Really nice owner.  

Meat dish had too much gristle.  Too much chewing and spitting out what  I didn't want to make my body digest.  

Kimchi was good."}
{"text":"Even one star is too many for this place. The owner is maybe nice his own kind but NOT to others l, he is so rude. He said to my face that he already have too many customers so I don't want yours. I never heard anything stupider than this.

Don't go there if you don't want to be discriminated."}
{"text":"Always good service with great food. The portions are large and served with a kind heart. My favorite is the cold noodles they make the best in town, and trust me I have tried everywhere but this cannot be beat"}
{"text":"So happy they opened a second location.  Same great food as their main restaurant but closer to home in summerlin.  Korean and Hawaiian food doesn't get better than this.   Really nice service too!"}
{"text":"I have been looking for a go to Korean place for a while. Found it! I was surprised to find Hawaii hospitality with awesome Korean food. All house made too. I will be frequenting here often. Oh, and the Hot Pot Bib Bim Bot is the best I ever had."}
{"text":"Yum yum yum yum. So delicious and the owner is super friendly. This is in a little Korean food court in the Greenland super market. If you've been to H Mart you will find this familiar. I had the hamburger steak and it was delicious. The kimchee and Mac salad was all really tasty. Great for take-out.
Their spam fried rice and seaweed soup are also amazing! We got take-out from there almost every day of our trip hahaha. Our family loved it."}
{"text":"Had the beef and chicken combo with rice, macaroni salad - seaweed soup - with 3 sides of kimchi/radish / rice noodle 

Great place for a quick lunch - it's one of the newer places in the food court. Customer service was perfection.  I have heard of Island Style before - did not realized they have been in town for 26 years . 

Now they have a Island Style 2 located in the Koreatown - Green Market (inside the food court) 

Will have to try the other dishes soon!"}
{"text":"The spicy chicken noodle was perfect. Costumer service was also amazing. Will definitely come back."}
{"text":"I just came from Seattle today and my girl decided to bring me to the Green Land Korean market to get food. We stumbled upon this place and let me tell ya, the guy who took care of us was so kind, caring, and sweet. He was the father figure I never had. He took our dishes for us when it is self clean, fed us lots of side dishes, made us tea which was really good, gave us water bottles for free, and watermelons. Not only the service was good, the food was excellent. We got kalbi. The texture and sauce was delicious. I will definitely be back here to try other foods whenever I visit Vegas again :-)"}
{"text":"Uncle Russel is the best, knew him for years and we been always going to the original spot on Sahara, but now we always come to this one in Greenland while we shop. It's a must stop for eat before you go on.

The food here is so damn Ono (delicious) I can begin to rave about everything here because it would be to long. 

Just eat here and you will not regret it."}
{"text":"first time here. i ordered the beef plate. very good, authentic korean food, huge service, awesome customer service! what's not to like?"}
{"text":"If it's one thing that I miss most about Hawaii, it's their food, anyone from Hawaii would know exactly what I'm talking about. Island Style brings a piece of home to you through their food and ambiance.  I ordered their spicy pork & squid mix which was full of flavor and and cooked perfectly, served on a sizzling platter. I love their banchan as well, it's simple but a perfect pair to go with your meal. We had great service from Russel, and we'll definitely be back to try other items on their menu."}
{"text":"Thoroughly enjoyed the stone bowl bibimbap here!  The red pepper paste was great and not too overpowering like it is at some places.  They also had a nice balance of rice and vegetables.  Some places have too much rice.  They were also fast and the staff was very nice - even bringing the order to our table."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I found this place on Yelp while shopping at Greenland Supermarket. Located inside the Korea Town Plaza Food Court, they serve a variety of Korean and Hawaiian dishes. We were immediately greeted by the owner who was super friendly. I ordered the chicken plate & my boyfriend ordered the meat jun. It came with sides including soup, bean sprouts, crab salad, mac salad, & kimchee. All of the dishes were flavorful and delicious. Next time we come back, we will be sure to try their other dishes."}
{"text":"What an unassuming little booth with a great menu, fast friendly and enthusiastic service.  Bibimbap was sizzling hot and delicious!!  A few down home Korean side dishes came with this meal. Excellent value. Yum"}
{"text":"Ono food! Thank you Russel! Your food always hits the spot! We'll be back every time! Usually order beef rib soup but this time decided on their kalbi plate! One of the better tasting kalbi so far. Most places are too salty but this one is just right! Yummy!"}
{"text":"Good food, reminded me of home and very friendly service, definitely show the aloha spirit in Vegas!"}
{"text":"Holy moley!  Just had the worst experience here. My husband and I were looking forward to having a dish, bibimbap, that we both enjoy. I am allergic to peanuts, so I had to make sure there were no peanut products used on mine. I also had to ask the gentleman (and I use the term very loosely) to not put an egg on top of mine, because I also have high cholesterol. I also asked for double squid for my husband and said from the beginning that we both wanted the non-hot version. When the guy told me that he was getting us the hot, more expensive version, I corrected the order. He then told me that I was difficult, and his \"staff\" (one cook) would find our food too difficult to prepare!  Seriously?!?  I asked him if he wanted us to go somewhere else, and he sourly said, \"Yes!\" and shooed me away with his hands!  We had been there twice before and had really enjoyed the food, but we will never be back. What a jerk!"}
{"text":"Amazing service. If youve been to the other location on Sahara and are worried about a satellite location, don't be. The service is amazing. We got take out and the nice gentleman working gave us appetizer soup and drinks while we waited. It was awesome. Food court restaurants can be great!!"}
{"text":"Awesome 2nd location down the street. Menu is a little different from their 1st location. But the taste is still there."}
