{"text":"I should have known when the bar tender served me a Budweiser that was expired four months ago, that they we're domed. He said they didn't sell much bottled beer. Probably because no one went there."}
{"text":"The burgers are fantastic! The bun bread is great, soft, sweet but I wish a tiny bit smaller. Burgers are cooked the way you like them, great choices for toppings and the fries are those delicious long fries with the skins on.  The manager was attentive, working the dining room. Server was a bit aloof, maybe too many tables. Ketchup for the fries is hard to come by. They give you a tiny metal cup and for a ketchup fiend like myself, it's no where near enough. Asked for more but the server never brought it.   All pickles in house are bread and butter style (sweet) this does not appeal to some people like myself who like a good dill kosher pickle.  Even the fried pickles are bread and butter pickles. Personally do not like those. Would be nice if they offered a dill kosher or even garlic pickle instead of just bread and butter.  Great beer selection, GREAT happy hour, and prices are reasonable.  If you ask, there IS a KIDS menu. The kids burgers are half-size (4 oz) but use the adult bun so your kid will have a ton of bread. They also offer hot dogs, mac and cheese, and chicken with veggies. Just ask.  Not too noisy a place, very trendy. Not a great place for kids, but they do make accommodations for them even going as far as lids for cups.  Will be back"}
{"text":"This is our 2nd visit.    Great burger, fries were excellent and the manager even checked to ensure our satisfaction.  Server was really on top of things.  We'll be back soon."}
{"text":"My favorite burger place. Delicious cheese platter and fried pickles. I love the Burrata burger and the Lamb burger (I think they discontinued it tho). Great drink options and check out their happy hour and milkshakes. If you sign up for their newsletter, you get a free milkshake on your birthday month."}
{"text":"Mu husband and I went here on a Thursday (4-16-15). It was our first visit. I rate three stars because our burgers were excellent. Two stars lost because the service was VERY slow and our server spent more time talking us out of items than encouraging us to try them (i.e., the different fries, extra burger toppings). Another star lost because even though the restaurant was not even half full, the owner stopped by the table both across from us and behind us and chatted with the patrons. hope this was just rude and not racist as we were the only \"chocolate\" customers. Price is comparable to B-Spot."}
{"text":"They have the best burgers here I have ever eaten. If you can eat it all in one sitting you deserve an award. This place has any other burger place beat by a mile and they also have an excellent cocktail, beer and wine menu."}
{"text":"GREAT BURGERS!!! Stopped in for the 1st time last night. After a bit of confusion about who would be our server  and more than a few minutes to get our first round of drinks, the service got much better. We started off with the cheese board and fried pickles. Both were good. The true winner here is the fabulous(and I mean FABULOUS) burgers. My wife loved the grind burger which arrived properly cooked with a side of truffle fries. I had the Wagyu burger. This had to be the BEST burger I've had in many, many years. This place just opened and they have a few kinks to work out of the system, but they are on the right track. Great quality meat & soft buns- excellent!"}
{"text":"Great Burgers, several options on the menu, clean and welcoming environment, better than B Spot in my opinion."}
{"text":"Food was great but service was very slow. We waited forever to get our food and there wasn't many people in the restaurant."}
{"text":"New restaurant with great burgers and bacon. However, service was extremely slow. We were there for an hour before we got our food. We were there with the baby and it was way too long to wait for a burger. We might try it again. If they work out the kinks it could be a great place."}
{"text":"I really dig this place... been here twice on weeknights, boith times picking up the Happy Hour menu (if I recall, two dollars off burgers, a dollar off sides, plus drink specials).    I've found that sides are good for 15 people, so good to share if you're with a group (recommend the onion rings).  Service great, food superb, a bit on the spendy side if not during Happy Hour but worth every penny."}
{"text":"Love this place. Solid service and always good food and drinks. Love the sauerkraut balls and the burrata burger. Reasonably priced for the quality you get."}
{"text":"My first time here, they have a great atmosphere and a very friendly staff. They have live music on Friday and Saturday nights. They have a lounging area with several couches by the music area. It has that New York coffee house feel but with a bar. The have a wide variety of beers on tap and in bottles. There selection is not something you will find at your corner bar. So if you like to venture outside the box I recommend stopping in. They also have an outdoor patio and a garage door window that opens ad allows seating at the bar. I didn't have food but the food smelled and looked awesome. I will be back for a meal."}
{"text":"Hands down best burger in all of Cleveland! And that is hard to say , considering there might be 10 different burger joints around Cleveland right now.   The burger itself is fresh ground daily. The burger itself has so much flavor. We also got the cookies and cream milkshakes, which was ridic. Came garnished with a deep fried Oreo. Which my pregnant wife would only allow me to have 1/10 of.   My only complaint is that the food takes long to prepare. Definitely not as fast as B spot but I guess that is not the point. Definitely worth the wait.   Now please bring 1 to the west side!"}
{"text":"This eatery was recommended by a friend for its fresh grinded meat and daily products from the neighborhood.  Like the concept of buying in town from local people. The place isn't New York, Chicago or even Ohio City with a location near nothing for this type of restaurant. The prices seem high with a small burger and fries not  included. The milk shakes were a good size but the KIt Kat mixed to well tasted like chocolate milk instead of ice cream shake. The question will be if this place will last with the prices and location with everyday people in the neighborhood."}
{"text":"We chose to go to this restaurant because of the high ratings.  I don't understand how they gave this place 5 stars.  If you are going to sell high priced burgers they better be cooked right.  I ordered the burger medium and it came out well done.  I think this is a crime in some states.  We were seated at the bar and the two people seated next to us had to send their burgers back.  One of them sent it back twice.  They have a partially open kitchen and it was clear that it was a bit chaotic back there.  As for the fries, they came out warm, not hot, and not crispy.    On the positive side the toppings for the signature Grind Burger tasted ok and if the burger had been cooked properly I think the meat would have come out much better.  Since the meat was being ground on site, it was at least fresh.  The bun was soft and tasted ok.  Did I mention it took 45 minutes to get our food after we ordered, the people next to us had to wait longer, not counting sending the food back.  I could see taking this long if the meal was complex, but we ordered burgers and fries.  I was not looking for fast food speed, but 45 minutes is ridiculous.  I will say the people were nice and I think they were trying their best.  It seemed like this was a new restaurant where people were just getting organized.  The waiter bring our food did not seem to know who should get it even though he had a location number.  As with all reviews, maybe we just stumbled into a bad evening for the place, but if you are going to compete with the B Spot and other high end burger places you need to be on top of it."}
{"text":"Great tasting burgers.  Tried it on a recommendation from a friend.  Service was excellent."}
{"text":"The place is brand new and looks fabulous . The service was beyond slow ,but the beer was cold so thats good. My burger was ordered medium and it came out somewhere between well done and lets see how long we can cook this one . The buns were dry also . The chicken sandwich was also dry and cooked like it was punished for being bad  :(  . the fries for 2 were cold and enough for 2 two year olds. The mac and cheese is very odd and i didn't like it but at least it was served hot. Everything took for ever . Oh and i had hot dog sliders also which were cold and gross. I will try it again cuz i love burgers and had high hopes."}
{"text":"We went in to Grind Burger because it's new in our neighborhood.  I knew my husband would love a burger for dinner and just went along even though I prefer salad or chicken instead of burgers. I was happy to see that there were other alternatives and really glad I ordered the turkey burger.  It was delicious!  The burgers were really large and we also ordered a side of veggies.  We enjoyed the steamed veggies as well.    The ambiance was open and eclectic, with lots of windows.  I liked the wine glass chandeliers.  Very different.  It looks like in warmer weather the bar, which has windows that roll up like a garage door behind it, can serve the outdoor patio while keeping the inside airy.  In the bar area there are couches, chairs and coffee tables.  Conducive to relaxing and trying one of the interesting/cool cocktail recipes on the menu."}
{"text":"So I had been hearing good things about Grind Burger from several ppl but what caught my eye and had to see for myself was the Wine down Mondays where you can purchase select bottles of wine for 1/2 off....yes you heard me correctly 1/2 off....so on Monday March 9, 2015 I dropped on in.....that was a good day because Cleveland Scene Magazine was there for votes of best resturant and bartendar..go figure....ok back to my adventure....this day was also special because I got to meet John Wiley the master bartendar who had just gotten back from traveling..and was being honored for best bartendar.....since he doesn't work Monday's I just so happen to come in on the Monday he would be there.....of course I like to ask the persons who work there what do they recommend and everything from the Wine-Trivento Malbec to the Martini drink Not So Jalapeno to the fried pickles and the Over Easy Wagyu beef burger.....now personally I'm not really big on beef but if your going to go to a burger spot its a must.....needless to say I was OMG impressed so much so that I left and came back......I also got a chance to meet Michelle, Craig and Shawn....they were a delight to talk to and really made me feel at home.....which is why I recommend Grind Burger.....give them a try.... trust me you won't be disappointed and before I forget don't let me leave out their daily happy hour and hours of operation:   Sunday--Thursday  11 a.m. to 10 p.m.  Friday & Saturday  11 a.m. to 12 a.m.   Daily Happy Hour  4 p.m. to 6 p.m.  Thanks for a wonderful experience Grind Burger John W., Michelle, Craig and Shawn....YOU ROCK!

{"text":"I visited Grindburger with some coworkers last week, and the consensus was that we were underwhelmed. Maybe the first clue was that we arrived about a quarter to 1, and the restaurant was basically empty, when most places would still have had a fairly decent number of lunch customers. It's a little out of the way, so, benefit of the doubt, maybe they don't get huge crowds normally and folks might leave early to get back to work on time.  Anyway, the first impression is that it's a nice place, upscale casual with cool decor and quality furnishings. Our server was prompt and friendly. The prices are high for a burger joint, but the promise of Wagyu beef and truffles in some offerings make it seem worthwhile. I'm a little suspicious, though, that the prices of those items wouldn't be even higher.  We ordered some fries for the table, which didn't arrive until after our meals, and they were barely warm. The server apologized and said she would put another order in. The second order came out quickly and were much better.  I had the truffle burger and it was very good. A coworker ordered the veggie plate, which I didn't try, but others said they were excellent. They had a maple glaze and smelled like pancakes.  All in all, there were some good things and some bad things. It's a good concept, but the price level is too high for flawed execution. I could excuse some things at the peak of the lunch rush, but not in an empty restaurant. There's definitely potential, but our experience was a little disappointing."}
{"text":"I just had my one and only experience at Grindburger! We walked into the restaurant and the floors were so slippery! We thought that our feet were wet because it had been raining, so we wiped our feet on the rug by the front door but the floor was still slippery! As the waitress showed us our table, we were slipping and sliding behind her.  We sat at the table; even the table was sliding around.  I touched the table,  IT WAS GREASY! We got up and slide right out of there!  If the floor and tables aren't clean, I can only imagine what their kitchen looks like!"}
{"text":"I don't know if the staff was off their game or what. We were seated after about a ten minute wait then we waited at least 10 minutes to even be acknowledged by our server. The service seemed to be slow for the tables around us as well. Drinks took forever and the food took even longer to come out. When the food came out it was hot and pretty yummy although it did not make up for the lack of service. The woman at the table next to us received her mac and cheese and it looked totally dry and greasy like it had been sitting in the window for 35 minutes and the sauce broke, and she then complained it was cold. I was irritated for her. So if you want to wait longer than it takes to eat your food and pay 15 bucks for a burger than this is a place for you. They really need to get it together. I will not be going back."}
{"text":"Atmosphere was trendy and clean   Burgers were good however in my opinion a bit to pricey. You have to order everything a la carte.   The reason I'm giving this place a 2 star review is because the service was horrible. It took us about an hour and a half to get out food and it was a slower Monday night. Server was not attentive as far as refills etc.. Again the burgers tasted good however not cooked to what we ordered   I noticed there was a lot of frustrated tables. We certainly we're not the only ones. The table next to us had to return their burgers not once but twice bc they were cooked wrong.   Save yourself the time and money and go to 5 guys or b spot"}
{"text":"Great burgers with a unique twist on the preparation.  Had the blue cheese burger with wagyu blend meat which is worth the extra charge. We split an order of truffle fries which was great tasting. High my recommend this local eatery. Top 5 burger place in Cleveland.   There is a great sitting area to enjoy a glass of wine or draft beer too. Could be a great place for happy hour."}
{"text":"We were so excited to try out this new place.... eh it was ok. We went in before the lunch rush to avoid the crowd. The atmosphere is cool. nice and clean. There seems to be some wasted space for a lounge type area. I would put more tables there personally since there aren't that many.  Service was not the best. The waitress was nice but never asked if we wanted more water. All of our burgers came out at different times and the fries came out last. We had already hacked our way through our burgers with the butter knives and were almost done eating half when she finally brought over steak knives to cut the burgers.   I did a build your own with turkery. it was ok. nothing specatular. we ordered truffle fries but they came out last and weren't hot... and no taste of truffle.   Not sure if I would bother coming back here."}
{"text":"We ordered mac and cheese. It had no cheese and was super salty. Like NO cheese. We ordered Bloody Mary drinks and they had no tomato juice it looked more orange than anything. I ordered cheese on my Burger and there was no cheese. What can I say. Never again!"}
{"text":"Amazing burgers! I loved the grindburger. Great salads. You can build your own burgers. Best burger in Cleveland. Forget B-spot this is the place to go"}
{"text":"This spot is okay... burger was juicy and cooked well, but the pattty to bun ratio was off, too.much bread.  The main reason I gave this a low rating was because of management.   There was a clump of hair in our basket of fries.  The server was great and was disgusted by it as well and offered us a fresh basket, which we turned down because we were no longer hungry. The problem is that the manager didn't come to see us until we asked to speak with him.  When he came over and we complained,  he said \"I offered you a new order and I told the cook to trim his beard\"  this Is unacceptable customer service.  A real manager would have come over on his own and bent over backwards to make us happy.  If the manager had had a better attitude and been even remotely sorry we would have been satisfied.  Who knows what else had hair in it that we didn't notice."}
{"text":"Second time at Grind. First time was great. Food, service everything was on point. I was excited to return.  This time I am sincerely disappointed. Our medium rare burgers came out well done. Service was abhorrent.  We requested replacements.   Bartender was slow, indifferent, and blamed the error on a \"cook that can't read\".  New burgers came slowly but prepared properly. Should be the end of my review.  The owner came out helped her self to a drink from the bar cooler and chatted with a couple, a few seats down. No questions regarding the quality of our experience, 're cook, or even a \"hello\".  I did not warrant her attention until I went outside to smoke.  A completely empty patio. She rudley explained it was a no smoking patio. Her patio her prerogative. However no signage and her bartender unlocked the door for me.   Honestly the food came out properly the second time. That does not excuse the horrendous service or management wearing sweat pants.  Do yourself a favor and order to go. Hope for the best."}
{"text":"This place is located at the corner Brainard Road and Wilson Mills Road, which is very convenient, a lot of parking space.  The atmosphere is hip and casual, relax and comfortable.  They also have patio section opened.  We were seated inside.  The place was not as clean as I expected.    All servers wore a black t-shirt with had strange quote on the back, e.g.- Perfection is messy, Our meat can't be beat,etc.   Our server was young and attentive but the service was relatively slow.  The menu is short and everything is built around the burgers.  All burgers cost around $10-15, not very cheap but acceptable for the hi-end burgers.   I ordered a Turkey burgers for myself and the skinny shroom from Not a Burgers section for appetite, my husband chose to built his own burger.   The skinny shroom is actually a veggie burgers which surprised us since we expected it as a grilled veggie on a plate.  It tasted delicious and tasty.  My Turkey burgers was a bit disappointed for me.  It was quite bland and it was served just only a burger and a piece of pickle cucumber on a plate, no fried.  I expected some french fried and some vegetable for this price.  My husband ordered a french fried for his burger, so we have some fried for our burgers.  Both of our burgers meat was properly cooked and juicy.   His burgers tasted better than mine.  For overall experience, Grindburgers is a fine burger place and a good adding to Wilson Mills road.  However, there are a room for improvement."}
{"text":"Decent meat but I expected more from an $ 11 grind burger. Not impressive, there are tons of choices for a good meal in this price range. Burgers don't even come with any sides."}
{"text":"I have no idea why this doesn't have a higher rating. It's all about the meat. Shell out for wagyu and order it as rare as you can stand. Get the cookie skillet after for pure decadence. Worth the price for how delicious everything is."}
{"text":"I visted Grind Burger a couple weeks ago...and I was a little leery after seeing so many mixed reviews. I thought the food was okay. A little pricey for a burger joint, but the ingredients seemed fresh. I also had the pleasure of devouring an amazing salted caramel milkshake, which definitely made the trip. The burgers are a little on the smaller side--- more of a plump and small patty, rather than a big and thin one. I would try again."}
{"text":"35 minutes to get order.  Over priced fries cold.  They boast \"perfection is messy\", yet the largest napkin is 4x4.  Burger, fries and milkshake is over $20 w/o tax and tip. Pretty steep.  Burger was good, but small.   35 minutes to wait, 5 minutes to eat."}
{"text":"Solid burger joint. Nothing revolutionary about their burgers, but they hit the spot.   They dont give you sides with the burger, which is a little annoying as the pricing is high enough that they should.   Maybe stay away from the loaded fries - they are a little bland."}
{"text":"The 4 stars are completely for the food only. The service is weird, but I wouldn't call it bad...I also wouldn't give it 4 stars.  We ordered a grilled artichoke as an appetizer and were pleasantly surprised! The flavor was great, with plenty of lemon and the \"meat\" of the veggie was tender and juicy. We inhaled it and immediately decided that no matter what happened with the burgers, we would be back for that 'choke. (This may also be due in part to the fact that it's so incredibly rare to see a whole artichoke on a menu, and no frying involved.)  Meanwhile, we're enjoying our time at the bar, people watching and chatting. The bartender is keeping her distance...for now. This is all after her super long crazy spiel about the meat and how it's hand ground and you can watch it happen LIVE and the burgers are the best ever, blah blah blah (it got really repetitive and she was clearly passionate, but I was overwhelmed). We are patiently waiting for our burgers and fries and when they finally come out, we eagerly dug in...  We had the unfortunate sink seats at the bar. So our bartender stood directly in front of us filling the sinks while we began to eat. Poor timing? Conspiracy? Maybe. She literally was forehead to forehead with me while I took my first bites of the burger and held in my first thoughts because I was afraid she'd shank me if I said it was anything short of UTTERLY LIFE CHANGING...  While the burger (Aria burger--the fried pickles were sweet...weird) was good, I wouldn't say it was the BEST EVER. It was slightly overcooked for my taste, but otherwise delicious and I certainly wouldn't be hard pressed to come eat here again. Fries weren't quite memorable for me, but perhaps that's because all I can recall is the deluge of burger praise the bartender subjected me to for the rest of the experience. As I'm trying to eat, she's going ON AND ON AND ON AND ON about how much she loves Grind Burger burgers and can't eat burgers anywhere else and doesn't trust anyone or any meat or meat temperatures, etc. etc. etc...   I can't be TOO mad because it's really nice to see someone so into their job. It's clear she's not just a brainwashed drone...or maybe she is and she hides it well? Either way, it was just way too much. I felt like I couldn't talk to my husband, I couldn't eat, and I definitely couldn't relax. Maybe I should have had a beer or two to take the edge off of her crazed love for the place. We'll be back, but I'll definitely eye the bar staff before choosing to belly up over sitting at a table."}
{"text":"This place is definitely a little known gem. I take workout classes at Fitworks and noticed Grind Burger since it's located in the same parking lot. I decided to check it out and was amazed! The truffle fries are out of this world and if you're craving something other than a burger, the bacon candy salad is to die for! Overall,  I was extremely surprised by the quality of the food here and rate it higher than more popular burger joints in the area."}
{"text":"Delicious burger, cooked medium (what we asked for).  I don't understand the bad reviews, they must have responded and fixed their issues.  By the way, the grilled artichoke was awesome, I recommend it.  I see why this place was ranked higher than B Spot, Michael Symon should try it.  You can definitely tell the meat is freshly ground, it tastes better.  Definitely will be our Go-To for a burger"}
{"text":"Bad service kills this place...which is a royal shame.  The food is good even though requested medium burger was still undercooked in the middle.   But seriously, this place needs to train its staff.  Twice we have been here and the host had no idea what he was doing, and the staff had irritated looks on their faces.  And the staff seems to congregate in areas near the order input system and you can overhear them complaining about working there.  We waited 15 minutes for our server to arrive at our table...and that was on a non-busy Tuesday night.  2 managers stopped by our table so clearly they are top-heavy in management but seriously, focus on the hostess and waitstaff.  They will kill your business unless you train them.  Wine choices range from a dumpy low-priced option (one) and then jumps to selections that are $9 and up by the glass.  For a burger joint I feel this is over-reaching a bit.  A wine bar is a different story..."}
{"text":"Meh. This is yet another trendy upstart burger joint that tries too hard to make appearances so they can justify higher prices on mediocre food. I could go on, but I'm pretty sure you already know what I am talking about.   Grind burger has edible to OK food at high prices. Bad combo. I won't be back."}
{"text":"So I am going to fall on the 4 star side.  It is based on the gut feeling that some of the small things can get worked out.  So let me start by saying that I am a fan of the burgers.  They do not press them, they gently mold them.  This makes a huge difference when it comes to how juicy your burger is and if they can actually make it med-rare.  The buns are fresh and soft and toasted just right.  I will say I had their spicy burger and it had good flavor, but was not spicy from a heat perspective.    The layout is a little odd and very industrial.  Bar and tables to the rights, booths to the left split by a half wall.  So it is not very warm and overly inviting, but it does facilitate larger groups and good conversation with your friends.  No need to shout.  The server was really great and things were handled quickly.  One thing I appreciate I that they actually have their staff taste everything on their menu.  I find it amazing when I go to a restaurant and ask my wait person their opinion and they have not even tasted the food their. In this case, apparently the management team is on the ball.  So my server was able to provide her insight and pros and conns of the two things I was interested in.  What I am not a fan of though is the ale cart approach to burger and fries.  at ~$10.00 per burger, and few fries on the plate does not seem unreasonable.  If you want to have your special fries as a separate side, that is fine, but be kind with the spuds."}
{"text":"I was very excited to try this new burger spot that just opened up. When we got there it was pretty busy but we didn't have to wait long for our table.   Unfortunately, the food didn't live up to my expectations of the place. It's not that the food was bad but definitely wasn't great.   My girlfriend and I both got the triple truffle burger. It was very underwhelming. My burger was over cooked. I asked for Med-Rare but definitely got something closer to Med-Well but I wasn't going to be one to complain about that. The burger itself was on the small side and definitely left me wanting/expecting more. The flavor isn't what I was expecting either. With truffle I usually expect a very flavorful and juicy burger. This was neither of the two.   I would try it again to give it the benefit of the doubt but I was not very impressed with my first go around."}
{"text":"The burgers, beer, atmosphere,  and service are exceptional here! The manager is so personable,  and they have great pride in how homemade everything is.  Even the cucumber sugar on the glass of the specialty drink I ordered was homemade!  I highly recommend this restaurant!"}
{"text":"Last time I come here. Food arrived but no flatware and napkins. Requested them from the food runner. She brought one set for two people. I got up and asked for a second set, was told to sit down. Eventually we got our silverware. Tucked into my salad-no dressing! Waiter? MIA. Enough."}
{"text":"The Grind Burger was good. If you like sautéed onions this is for you! Fries were okay nothing special about them."}
{"text":"Even though I'm historically leary about trying new places after they have just opened up, I went with some coworkers to try the new place out.  I arrived at 11:40 in order to beat some of the lunch traffic. It wasn't very busy at that time and was quickly seated. I did see that as noon approached, the number of tables available became very scarce.  There was a new host up front and he was being assisted by another person on how to put the placemats down, and where to put the silverware. One thought. When you have the busser clean the tables, it might be easier to have them leave the silverware there. That is one less thing the host has to carry. My $.02. The artichoke appetizer was unfortunately not available so I did the truffle fries. They were quite good, but I really wish they had the artichoke. Maybe another time. I did the truffle burger and it was quite good. For once, a burger that is medium rare, came out as medium rare.  The server, Justin, was hospitable, checked on our water, gave us a quick tour of the kitchen and was well informed of the menu and even provided some of his favorites.  Overall, the weight wasn't particularly long, and the service was good. I know it's still a new business so they have some growing pains but hopefully they continue to grow. The only reason why I didn't give a 5 star rating was the price. It's a little on the steep side. Fries and a burger over $20 for lunch is a bit high."}
{"text":"I'm not sure why people are being so hard on this restaurant.  I suspect it is because the prices are a little bit high but I felt that the quality of the food was quite good.  I went with a friend who is a regular there.    Ambiance was very nice- modern industrial looking with a nice lounge area that I was not that interested in visiting.  I went in the middle of the day on a week day and only 4 tables were filled.    Waitstaff was polite and did a good job of giving us the appropriate amount of time to look at the menu, and the owner came by to say \"hello\" which was nice.  We ordered the bacon appetizer, which was ok.  A little more bacon than I needed, but I guess that is the point.    My Wagyu burger was delicious- I had it cooked to medium.  Really enjoyed it a lot, which I better have for the $15 that it cost me.  To be honest, for the price I paid, it was a little underwhelming to have the burger just come sitting on a plain plate, even though it was delicious.  I probably won't get it in the future, since I suspect I'd get 90% of the pleasure from eating one of the normal burgers.  The truffle fries were fantastic- I really enjoyed them and will definitely order them again if I come out here.  How does it compare to B-Spot?  I miss B-Spot's pickle bar and Michael Symon vibe, but this could be a place to hang out after work with a group, where B-Spot seems more a place for eating.  Quality of the burgers?  Honestly, both are delicious and B-spot is cheaper.  I think that I like the thickness of the truffle fries better than the shoestring style of the rosemary fries at B-spot.  Ultimately, I think this place deserves better reviews than what it is getting.  Hopefully people are willing to give it a shot.  I think that they should consider lowering the prices somewhat, or including a small order of fries with their burgers that people can pay to upgrade to truffle fries.  That would increase the value proposition signficantly.  As it is, $15 for a burger, Wagyu or not, is a lot and I probably wouldn't do it again, good as it was.    Next time I'm in the area and hungry, I'll be back and I'll even bring The Wife."}
{"text":"We went there on a Saturday around lunch time.  It was not too busy and the staff was very attentive.  They had  great burgers, good beers, good fries,  but the MILKSHAKES were the highlight of the meal.  Side note -- they have the cleanest bathrooms on the east side (of Cleveland)"}
{"text":"I was really looking forward to this burger when I heard about it.  Only place in Ohio that apparently grinds your burger to order.  That's pretty cool.  And they have a window to watch them actually do it, cool.  Look/feel of the place, also cool.  They had the garage door up at the bar, and the weather was perfect, so we sat on the patio side of the bar.  The two guys behind the bar were also friendly, though one talked a little too much about previous bad customers, but we were all laughing about it, so we might have encouraged it.  They hyped menu items after we asked about them, like the Candied Bacon (tasty).  We ordered burgers, and since there was a Wagyu Beef option on the burgers, we both went with that.  Made it like a $15 burger, but I've had more expensive non-Wagyu burgers.  I ordered mine Medium (some pink) and my friend ordered his Medium Rare (more pink).  I was going on the assumption that a restaurant concentrating on the beef and the process would have chefs with equal concerns.  This was apparently not the case, as both of our burgers came out Well Done.  Anyone that has ever been to a steakhouse of any repute can tell you that usually they have a disclaimer on their menu that says \"We are not responsible for the quality of a steak cooked Well Done.\"  That's because they've cooked out all the flavor/fat (which is what gives Wagyu Beef so much flavor, all marbleized with fat).  To their credit, and customer service (earning them another star) was that one of the guys asked how everything was, and if the burgers were cooked correctly.  We were not in a hurry, per se, but we did have somewhere to be, so we deceitfully said the burgers were great.  We hadn't made it back to the car before I was like, \"Was your burger totally incinerated?!\" \"Yeah totally, that's why I ordered it Medium Rare, like that mattered!\"  It was a Saturday for late-ish lunch(1:30?), and there were only like 3 other occupied tables.  I dunno.  For a place with the word Burger in their name, that offers Wagyu on their menu, I expected they would have a more well trained chef to make the meat shine.  I was really quite disappointed.  Hopefully this was an anomaly.  Honestly, probably more of a 2.5 stars, but I rounded up.  Check out the pix I uploaded..."}
{"text":"Visited on a Thursday afternoon around 3, and to my surprise, was virtually empty.  Server was very attentive/imformative...explaining the establishment and menu... Had decent draft list (had columbus Bodhi on!  6bux for a 20oz) and nice cocktail and spiked milkshake list as well... Ordered over easy burger w waygu beef and a basket of hand cut house fries. Both were out promptly, and they were both fantastic.  Prob one of the best burgers I can remember...will def be bak to try the other versions and rest of menu... Nice job!"}
{"text":"5 star food 0 star everything else  I love Grind Burger.  I love their food.  I love some of the waiters.  For some reason they don't love me.   Hubby and I like to come on Mondays after working out.  We also like to randomly come throughout the week.  When Shawn is there or a couple servers,  it's wonderful.  Other times,  everything is made wrong or it takes 40 minutes to get our food in a dead restaurant.  Sometimes they close early,  which is understandable,  but they never put a sign on the door. Today we walked in to find half the lights out and what appeared to be a staff meeting.  The husband owner said \"guys we're closed\"  like he was annoyed we walked in.  The door was unlocked and there wasn't a sign!   If you are able to eat here,  try one of the burgers (any of them!),  get a milkshake,  or the Yummy salad. The bacon appetizer is OK, but a tad overpriced to me."}
{"text":"I love this place! The service and the food is great. The burgers are the finest cut. I will recommend this place to anyone.  The service and food and stellar. Try the key lime martini. AMAZING!!!!"}
{"text":"Worst service ever! almost waited 30 min for a salad with chicken ..ordered a cookie and it came out before my actual meal.But the manager was kind enough to remove the glob of cookie dough off of my order..his excuse for the reason the dessert came out first was because the chicken is made to order...dumbest excuse ever ! Thanks for wasting my 1hour break ...buyer beware!"}
{"text":"Very tasty WAGYU beef burger  Because they massage the cows and feed them alcohol to aid in digestion   Wow  I'm sure their lives were wonderful before they double ground the meat to be my hamburger   Crazy   I wanted to compare - a tasted and quality test of regular Angus beef burger (which is $4 less) and the WAGYU beef burger   Maybe next time - I ordered mine Medium but it was a little redder than I would think medium is  - more like medium rare   But is was very good  The truffle aioli wasn't for me - the waiter said it was expensive mayonnaise- the most expensive mayonnaise you will ever have - not for my liking   The sweet potato fries were good   So $17 burger and fries with a glass of water with lemon"}
{"text":"I'm a fan of the B-Spot, and this place is MUCH better.  I had the signiature \"GrindBurger\" wife had a burger with Arugula and candied bacon, daughter had a build your own burger..... all tremendously good.  I had a 20 oz Smith and Forge Cider.  Really complimented the bacon appetizer.  Had the bacon milkshake for desert.  We are coming again.  Too bad the place is 30 miles from home."}
{"text":"The burgers are amazing. Seriously one of the best burgers I have ever had for a very reasonable price.  While the service was pretty bad, the food more than made up for it.  The house fries were also really good and extremely addicting.    The decor was really nice. You can choose between a bar setting or a sit down restaurant.  I thought the lounge family room area would be a really cool place a bunch of friends to hang out.    The food was just great...go get a burger!"}
{"text":"Service: ok Food: ok For a place that specializes in burgers they should be able to cook burgers correctly. I ordered a medium rare burger and received a well done burger. Burgers are all they do they should be able to get it right!"}
{"text":"Craig the owner reached out about my review in a very professional manner.  Even though I had some negatives he was open to hearing everything.  This is the kind of restauranteur who will listen and improve what he thinks are valid.  My kind of guy and definitely will try it again.  Thanks for listening Craig."}
{"text":"The place just opened, people should wait a little and try it at least twice before giving horrible yelp reviews. Give it time to work out the kinks. I thought my burger was delicious. The waitress was nice and we didn't have to wait long either. The fries were a little salty though, and does not feed two. I would go back again just because the burger was so good. Hopefully this place will get better with time."}
{"text":"The burger is tasty: but it is about the size of a meatball and is served on an under-sized bun. The fries are good, too. But they were served 15 minutes after we finished our burger. No compensation or apologies were offered.   The wait staff wear shirts that say \"you can't beat our meat\". Funny to me, but inappropriate for my kids to read.   One thing is for sure: you CAN beat their value.   Definitely not worth the high price. If you are in the area and want a delicious burger at a fair price, go to the Mill Tavern across the street."}
{"text":"First time here and I thought it was delicious! The triple truffle burger was one of the best I've had in the area (take note B Spot) and I'm pretty critical when it comes to burgers. I would love to order a fry and top it with few sides of the truffle aioli bc that stuff was incredible! Service was awesome too. Anthony was our server...he was super friendly and knowledgable of the menu. I'll definitely be back here, especially in the summer when I can hang out on their patio."}
{"text":"The good: meat was pretty good, not substantially better than other good burger places, but, a small step above the norm. Burger came out as ordered. Cooked right, mushroom and jalepenos tasted good. Restaurant itself is new, open concept, comfortable.  The not so good: Bun way too thick, burger not so large, toppings (which you pay $1 more each) were sparce. Fries way too salty, undercooked. Even when we sent back and ordered well done, they were not very good. Not $5 fries by anu stretch.  While new, staff seems inexperienced and disorganized. Took about 30 minutes to get 2 burgers and fries.  Wish them luck, but, no need for me to go back. If I want a good $10+ burger,  I will go to Johnny's Little Bar."}
{"text":"The \"Bread Salad\" was just that. And the vinaigrette dressing on it  was just vinegar.  I paid 8 dollars for 87 cents worth of ingredients.  The service here is marginal. The menu is limited. The food is just ok and severely overpriced for the neighborhood.   The space is pretty cool tho.  I look forward to what will replace Grind Burger when it inevitably closes."}
{"text":"I had the new caprese burger and shared the truffle fries. It was delicious. Great atmosphere , decor and service. I will definitely be visiting again! Their menu is the bomb! A little pricey for burgers but worth it. No wait."}
{"text":"Saw this place featured on TV and thought they have an admirable concept: freshly ground prime quality local beef. I looked for their menu online and while the burger descriptions definitely sounded very yummy, these are some of the most expensive burgers I've ever seen... ranging from $11 to $15 - that's just the burger. Fries and other sides are extra. I have a deep appreciation for restaurants who serve quality local-centric ingredients, and these are described as gourmet burgers, so I figured that these contribute to the pricing. So... I ended up going there to try it.   When you walk in, you're greeted in a very cool lounge setting, more of what you'd see in an upscale bar/lounge. The bar sits behind the lounge area with TV's viewable at every angle. The bar opens up to an outdoor patio. Seating for diners are sectioned off to the other side. Very cool decor... they have chandeliers made from wine glasses, and others made from meat grinders. If you walk towards the back of the restaurant, you'll see the open kitchen and their walk-in cooler has a window where you can see where they freshly grind the burgers at. Pretty cool! And outside in the patio, they have a small garden where they grow some of their own crops for use at the restaurant.  Onto the food and service. We ordered appetizers, wings and fries. The garlic parm wings were very good; I would recommend them for wing-lovers. The fries were nothing special... ordered the truffle fries and they were just regular fries with some kind of dip. It was okay. Someone in our party also ordered the grilled ceasar salad. I don't think they really knew what they were ordering. The salad literally came grilled. So weird because the lettuce was wilted and soft. Not a salad I'd want to eat. Anyway... after our appetizers, our server didn't come back for the longest time to take our order. When we finished our appetizers, we had to flag her down to take our order. So service was a bit slow, and there weren't even a ton of people there on this Sunday night. I ordered the Triple Truffle Burger. Their menu describes this as:  \"That means Truffles X3. Truffle Salt Seasoned Burger, Petite Pecorino Cheese, Sautéed Mushrooms & Truffle Aioli on a Truffle Butter Bun\"  Sounds really yummy, right? I ordered mine medium, so I wanted some pink. Our food comes. Burger comes on a plate with one pickle chip. The burger is not very big... about the same size as you'd find at your everyday fast food joint. When asked, our server says they're about 8 oz. It seemed like I ordered from the kids menu. I finished my burger in about 12 seconds. Yep! Aba dee, aba dee, that's all folks! No, but really... I tried to take some time to enjoy the taste, and unfortunately, I just found nothing special about the \"taste\" of this burger. They claim and advertise that their goal is...  \"...to serve the most satisfying burger on earth.\"  ... but I just found very little satisfaction with the burger. It was small, I don't feel that it was seasoned well - kinda bland, and I asked for medium and mine was more well-done. I've read other reviews pointing out the incorrect temperature. Perhaps their cooks just need better training. After fries and wings for apps, I figured the burger would top me off. Nope! I was still hungry... so I got a large Kit Kat milkshake. It was a chocolate milkshake with chunks of Kit Kats in it. The chunks were too large to suck into the straw, so I almost had a brain hemorrhage a couple of times trying to suck up those Kit Kat chunks. $6 for the milkshake... nothing special. Spend your money on something else.  The owner, Michelle, came around to the tables to greet customers, which was nice. I always like to see that, especially in local establishments.  Overall? I've found much more satisfying $5 burgers in a hole-in-the-wall joint. Seriously - no joke (see my other reviews). Would I come back? Maybe. But I wouldn't be dragging my friends back here to satisfy any cravings."}
{"text":"since my first review, ive been to grind burger a few more times and was generally satisfied with the food and service.  so i decided to tell a friend and we went to have a great burger.  we decided to eat outside on the patio.  the table and subsequent plates brought out to us \"looked\" like they hadn't been cleaned which put me slightly off.  our server tells us that food is about an hour wait.  miffed about that, but having experienced it before here, i let that slide.  the beer selection was average at best.  im picky about that as well, so i didn't make a big deal about that, either.   we order onion rings...good, but the grease soaked up everything.  and here is where the \"fun\" begins.  food came out around 45-60 mins.  we built our own burgers...i wanted it cooked medium well, runny egg plus toppings not including bacon.  my friend asked for medium done, no runny egg, and bacon plus toppings with grilled onions.  guess how they came out?  yep, you guessed it: WELL DONE.  crumbling, even.  we told our server, she took them back and brought us out new ones.  guess how these came out?    WELL  DONE.  and to add insult to injury, mine had bacon on it.  my friend ate a half of their burger and wasn't pleased.  i had the server take that back and when my THIRD TRY came back, it was...  WELL  DONE  AGAIN.  now...here's where i really got mad.  a \"manager\" comes out and talked to us, and comped the whole bill.  he said all the right things, and my issue wasn't with him or the server...they did what they could.  my issue was that during this whole experience, i felt as if my business wasn't welcomed.  you see, there was another guy walking around, asking tables of guests how everything was, and NEVER CAME UP TO OUR TABLE.  AT ALL.  this has been of notice for me since the first day i went here...actually TEN DAYS prior i ate there and he asked me was the burger good.  you wouldn't ask that if you're not some kind of manager...more on that later.  after the \"manager\" comped our bill (and at this point it was late and they were shutting down) this guy is at the next table clearly talking about us to another coworker who kept looking back at us.  when we finally left, he said a dry and tasteless \"have a good night, guys.\"  here's what i think (and i could be wrong but i thought this): *the guy walking around talking to guests was the manager for the night *the \"manager\" sent out to us either was a lower-level manager or the manager of the cooks...and was sent out because the other guy walking around didn't want to deal with the situation (ive worked places before where you send a subordinate out to handle a problem) *this same guy was mad that they had to comp the bill because no money was being made.  therefore he wasn't going to come up to us, let someone else deal with it. *we were being talked about the whole night.  at no point were we visibly mad or loud, unruly, none of the sort.  completely and totally unacceptable.  i cannot in good faith return to this place and i don't think any of my coworkers should continue to frequent there as well."}
{"text":"I've gotta get this off my chest before I dive into my review. Places that don't put their pricing on their online menus (Grind Burger is far from alone here) irritate the shit out of me. Not as bad as places that don't include pricing on their beer menus, but irritating nonetheless. Sure, I may not always make my dining decisions based upon price, but I do like to be somewhat prepared before I pull the trigger. Moving on.  Grind Burger is all about burgers. Big surprise, right? High-priced burgers, to be more precise. Expect to pay in the neighborhood of $12 for a burger (tack on another $4 if you want to splurge on the Wagyu beef option). Something else you should know, all sides are extra, including fries. The burgers come with a plate and a couple of pickles, that's it. Want apps, they'll set you back an average of $8 a piece.  The atmosphere is somewhere north of hip and south of casual. Comfortable. The space is very open and well-lit with the bar and high-top tables taking up most of the real estate. More restaurant-style seating is available as well. There's also a large, garage door type window/door next to the bar that opens out on to the patio. I sure this will be nice once the weather is more accommodating.  Our server was young and eager to please. He knew the menu and the drinks selection and was quick to offer up suggestions for both. Speaking of drinks, several people have mentioned that they are expensive. While I personally wouldn't spend $9 on a cocktail, I found the beer menu pricing to be quite tame - $5-6 for most draught selections (16oz & 20oz pours available). You can also get a flight of four 3oz pours for $10 which is pretty reasonable. There were a few bottled beers that had some whacked out pricing (Sam Smith Oatmeal Stout gluten free for $8?) but even those were in line. Beer selection is decent, too, with somewhere around 20 taps.  The menu is, you guessed it, loaded with burger choices, You can select one of their designs or build your own. There's even a turkey burger if red meat's not your thing. Overall, I found the burgers to be pretty tasty. I decided to treat myself to the Wagyu beef option and, to be honest, it was lost on me. Sure, it was tasty, but I just didn't think it was worth the nearly 25% upcharge. My recommendation, if you want to experience Wagyu beef, order a steak. Once you grind it and load it with toppings you might as well be eating Wal-Mart beef for all your tastebuds will know.  Back to the burgers. Cooking temperatures for both of our burgers were missed slightly on the rare side which I didn't mind but my wife is a bit more sensitive about. Not a big deal. The meat was seasoned well, the buns were soft but the bottoms both sogged out very quickly. I also found the hot & spicy burger to be lacking in heat, especially after the server told me that the kitchen had just made it spicier. Heat levels are a bit subjective, I suppose.  The fries and onion rings were just about as good as I've had in some time. Both were cooked to perfection.  As I mentioned above, the server was pretty good, but I do have to mention the fairly significant oversight on the part of our server. He forgot to enter our appetizer order. We were really looking forward to trying the hot dog sliders, but I suppose it just wasn't meant to be.  For dessert (did I mention we went a little crazy?) we opted for their warm cookie skillet (their version of the Pazookie). It's a cast iron skillet, partially baked chocolate chip cookie, and vanilla ice cream. Again, not bad. I thought the cookie could have used another 5 minutes in the oven, but that didn't stop us from shoving the entire thing down our throats in less than 10 minutes.  Grind Burger is definitely good, there's no doubt about it. The challenge they face is that so are several other local establishments all of which have chosen to feature pricey burgers. I really like the unique ingredients and menu items, the beer selection and the greasy, good food, but with so many options that are closer to home I think this one won't be part of our regular rotation.  I still wanna try those hot dog sliders, though..."}
{"text":"Now this is what a burger is supposed to taste like!  With so many \"fancy\" dedicated burger joints, it's unfortunate that many are quite underwhelming in the taste department. The burger should be top priority.   I built my own burger but some of the menu creations looked pretty tasty as well. Most of the burgers average $11 and fries will cost you extra. They also have adult milkshakes but mixing alcohol and dairy has never appealed to me.   The atmosphere is dim and moody, lots of space and dedicated areas to eat or just have a beer - a large spacious bar, sofas and regular dining tables and chairs.   There weren't many patrons on a Sunday afternoon so service was good and the food came out quickly.   I'm not sure why this location is listed as closed on Yelp, good thing I called to double check."}
{"text":"I reallyreally wanted to like this place. I do think there's a lot of potential but just a few little things left to be desired...  The good: Service was excellent. The \"For the Love of Bacon\" appetizer (3 slices of candied bacon and 3 slices of deep-fried breaded bacon) was a unique dish with a sweet and savory twist...I mean, where else have you seen fried bacon on the menu?! My group also shared the fried oreos for dessert and they were deeeeelish.   The meh: I ordered the Aria burger, which sounded great in concept (fried pickles, smoked bacon, garlic cheddar, 1000 Island dressing) but tasted only okay in execution. The burger definitely needed more dressing and the bottom bun was pretty soggy when it arrived at the table. I also noticed that all the burgers don't come with any fries or chips on the side, and the restaurant tables are completely bare - both of which I'm not used to for a burger joint. If I'm eating a massive dripping burger, I'd really like to have some napkins handy! Also, if you want any ketchup or other condiments for your fries or burger, you'll have to order it through your waiter...we found that ketchup comes in two teeny tiny dipping plates for four people. It wasn't that bad, but I guess I'm just used to grabbing as much ketchup as I want from a bottle. Lastly, while my burger temp was on point, my friend's medium-well burger came out medium-rare and my other friend's medium-rare was more well. Luckily neither minded, but it still wasn't expected.  The restaurant itself is very nice and the menu has good variety. I'll come back to give it another try, but it's not at the very top of my burger spots to hit up."}
{"text":"Came in for a Sunday lunch. The food was sublime. I was just disappointed that i forgot to try the sweet potato fries. The Diable burger was the correct amount of spicy and the Grind burger was perfectly spiced with  cheese and onions."}
{"text":"Decided to give it a try despite hearing from multiple friends that it was expensive and not worth it. I had the Aria burger and the wife had the Grind burger. Mine was alright but I did not care for the Grind burger. The biggest fault would be that there is way to much bun for the burgers. The truffel fries were very good and so were the milkshakes we had, banana' s foster and cookie dough. However, with everything being really good except the burgers I cannot see myself going back there when its called Gring Burger and the burgers should be the best part of the meal.   A little note: its called grind burger because they double grind the meat and make the burger patties from good cuts of meat or what not, could not taste the difference compared to other burgers."}
{"text":"Well, I've wanted to try this place and I have and won't be back.  The food is good, the service leaves a lot to be desired.  We arrived about 1 p.m. and there were two other tables occupied and a couple outside although why you would want to sit in a parking lot and eat is beyond me.  The food is good but I've tasted better burgers at many places - Red Robin comes to mind and you get much better service and choice.  If you don't want burgers, don't go to this place because they don't have anything else.  The burgers were cooked the way we wanted but the fries came only when my husband mentioned that he ordered them and didn't get them.  Lots of them but not very good.  Never got refills on our drinks  The prices are extremely high for what  you get.  We will not be going back mainly because of the poor service and high prices."}
{"text":"This place is where it's at if you're a burger lover. Make sure you try the Waygu burger and have them explain why it's the best damn thing you'll ever put in your mouth. Not only is the burger boss, but the truffle fries are right on point. Great burgers, great beer selection, great staff. Five stars all around."}
{"text":"We won't be going back. We were here about 3months ago and it was fabulous.  They were not busy on a Friday night so we were suspicious.  It's because the burgers are just so-so.  I ordered medium rare and got medium. My husband sent his back because it was cold. His new burger was well done.   The food was not like it was before.  Our waitress was a delight, however."}
{"text":"1st let me start that when this place cooks the burger  Med to Med-rare the  end result is a very, very good burger.  This burger joint has a pretty cool layout with tables, a large bar, and some couches. Nice place, hard to believe this was once a grocery store when you walk inside.  Our server was attentive and very friendly.  When we ordered our burgers we asked for them medium rare.  She then proceeded to advise us that their medium rare is, well  lets just say she emphasized that they will be very pink( as they should be).  So the burgers arrived and they  were very well done. I of course sent mine back as i really do not like to spend 12$ dollars for a Wendy's double burger. This leads me to my next topic, 12$ is what I consider a lot of green to spend for some ground! in addition,I do not really care for places that do not provide the option for a single order of fries was well.  In fact that is  what I condsider a reason to not patronize an otherwise fine local establishment. I am not 25 anymore and a  consuming a basket of fries is not something I find necessary anymore.  in fact no amount of appetite enhancing tonics would make me do that.  In short 4 stars for a great tasting burger, from a local business, it was very good, however good burgers are becoming increasingly easy to find with less of a dent in my wallet.  2 burgers, an order of fries, and a beer should not come out to greater than 40$"}
{"text":"We've heard good things about this place, so we thought we would try it for Sunday dinner. It was about half full when we went in. After waiting for about 3 minutes, some guy came up to seat us. We then sat there for 15 minutes looking at the menu, without anyone stopping by our table. We tried to make eye contact with the waitstaff who was running around, but nobody stopped or said hi. So we walked out and no one said a word. Terrible service for a place that has been open almost a year."}
{"text":"Quality of the beef is excellent. Although the burgers are one step up from white castle size burgers.   Taste of the fries and burgers is tops.   Servers were nice. They should hire more of them.   Host was wearing street clothes. Seriously.........  Portion size for the price is unacceptable. Toppings for burgers are $1 each. Onions for $1???   Wait time for food and the bill is unacceptable. How long does it take to grill a burger?????  Nice vibe at Grind. Outdoor seating area is very comfy.  Like the crowd better at Grind than the types that eat at B Spot."}
{"text":"From a culinary perspective, a burger is a blank canvas that can be almost anything you can imagine.  If you put quality ingredients and creative tastes together in specific proportions the results can be amazing.    Or just overpriced and completely average, as you find at Grindburger.  First, the size of the burger is on the small side.  The bun is not big or thick enough and it is too light in texture to support a burger's foundation.  The beef ordered to be medium is in fact cooked medium rare.  Bland is the flavor of the beef, no seasoning.  Bland pink juices will saturate the bottom bun too.  This is the signature dish.  Even though I ordered my burger with the roasted poblano peppers and bacon I still found myself looking in vain for a salt shaker at the bar to liven up my burger.  Now the fries.  These are cooked nearly to perfection, then unfortunately are completely dredged in coarse seasonings that could be OK, but just overwhelm.  The grit factor had me very conscious of my tooth enamel.  A finer grind and much less applied would be great.  Now the good parts.  This place is so suave that it's really out of place and feels more like a hip new downtown joint than something in a converted strip plaza.  The beer selection is pretty good and the service is above average.  Everything is super clean and mod.  The bar is cool with an area that opens to the patio.  For a burger and fries, unfortunately you could do better to go to Applebee's."}
{"text":"Service was absolutely terrible! Waited for over an hour for our food. I know if was a big party but seriously? Our meal should have been free. My chicken and waffles was cold. We won't be returning. Way to ruin a birthday celebration! I was sad to here you guys closed. All you really need was good management and things would have ran much more smooth. I wish you and the entire staff luck in your future. Hopefully, if you decide to reopen a burger spot, you'll hire someone to manage that can actually manage."}
{"text":"Nice atmosphere, good service and a nice selection of burgers. Overall I was satisfied with the burger. Fries were under cooked. Would try again and would recommend it"}
{"text":"This place will be out of business very soon if they don't realize they have overpriced their food by A LOT, undersized their side portions and must up their quality. The area where this restaurant resides is not a $12 burger location, more of a $7-$8.  And $6 for fries with a portion no bigger than a mcdonalds medium, give me a break.  We were one of about three parties in the whole place at 7pm on a Wednesday night.  Their bacon appetizer was $7.50 for six slices of bacon. The chicken and waffles sandwich was like eating a fast food patty on an eggo.  Come on people, wake up.  Realize who your market is and actually make an attempt at putting decent food out."}
{"text":"Since I'm in Mayfield Heights alone for training this week, I was looking for a decent place for a meal and a beer tonight.  Checked it out on Yelp, and I must say I was not disappointed.  Service was great, bartender was friendly, and the manager stopped by to chat a few times. It was a nice day, so I enjoyed the fresh air coming in through the overhead door that they opened to the outdoor seating near the bar. They have a great selection of beers on tap.  I ordered onion rings as an appetizer. They were probably the best onion rings I've had. I ordered a Wagyu burger and grilled cauliflower. Both were very good. Would have liked to try a dessert, but there was no room. :)  Four stars only because I'm pretty picky."}
{"text":"I've always driven by this place and wondered what it was. I assumed it was some fast casual place but with burgers like a Burgers 2 Beer kind of deal, or a burger chipotle?   I decided to try it out, and was pleasantly surprised. The atmosphere is definitely cool with an industrial, trendy look to it. I was promptly seated, and the place wasn't busy which made me feel uneasy at first but I'm always someone who gives the benefit of the doubt.  Upon being seated I noticed the really neat bar & lounge area that was separate from the dining are and though it was very cool. I didn't expect there to be a full bar in this place. It definitely was surprising, and the list of cocktails, beers, and wines seemed like a great selection, although I didn't try any as I wasn't drinking.  The service was extremely friendly, and very sociable. I really enjoyed talking with them and learning about the place and the different items on the menu, My server was very informative.   I decided to go with the classic Grind Burger which had truffle aioli, zinfandel sauteed onions, but I also added some bacon as well (need to have that on a burger!). I assumed it came with fries, but the server asked me if I wanted to add a side? At first I was reluctant, thinking I'd only spend a certain amount on lunch at this moment but I wanted to try the fries so I opted to add them on. I was curious to try!  I ordered my burger medium-well, it came out within about 15 minutes, it wasn't too long. The burger came out looking absolutely delicious, and the fries looked fresh as well. The burger itself was very juicy, delicious and the flavors were fantastic. Everything balanced very well in a scrumptious bite! Only downfall was that it was quite messy, but most burgers are.  Overall, I'm very happy. The burger was delicious and I'm happy I stopped in. It is a little pricey but that never scares me away from good eats.  I'll be back to try something different, and have a cocktail next time."}
{"text":"It was nice/surprising to see this burger joint pop up in Highland Heights, fairly close to Burgers 2 Beer or whatever is down the street. The interior has an interesting layout -- you walk into a lounge area that is actually bigger than the dining room, which is to the left and separated from the lounge by a room divider.  I stopped in at dinner time and definitely wanted a beer. They have a pretty decent draft selection (for Highland Heights), certainly nothing to rave about but at least it goes beyond Bud.  My friend and I ordered an appetizer to share, the artichoke heart with lemon aioli. The artichoke was fine, though a bit greasy.  Next up, I got the Diablo Burger and my friend had a chicken sandwich. The Diablo was a train wreck. The best part about that burger was the fluffy top bun. The buns were way bigger than the meat or toppings, and the toppings? A SNOOZE FEST. The Diablo was supposed to be a spicy burger with buffalo sauce but all I could taste was salt salt salt. The burger patty itself was oversalted (and overcooked, as I ordered medium and got well done), and the toppings were salty too. I didn't discern any spice... like not even a tingle.  After a couple of bites, I sent the sandwich back. If I were reviewing this establishment solely on the burger I had, I would give 1 star. However, my friend's chicken sandwich was unexpectedly complex and delicious. It had roasted apples and some pecan chutney or something... on a simple grilled chicken breast, it was pretty delicious. Also, although the server seemed kind of inexperienced and flustered when I said my burger was salty and I was finished with it, both she and the manager offered to remake the sandwich or get me a milkshake. I declined all the offers just because I didn't want to wait for a second sandwich (and there was so much wrong with the fist one beyond the saltiness, I doubt I would have enjoyed a second rendition), nor was I in the mood for a shake. Still, they were very nice about it and really tried to make it right.  Considering all the factors, this place is A-OK. I would give them 2.5 stars but I'll bump them up because, hey, this is HH... what else do we have?? There is definitely room for improvement here.  Side note, burgers (even if/when done correctly) are way too pricy to come without any fries. And for a side of fries to start at $5?? Nope.  A lot of people compare this to the B Spot, and I guess I can sorta see the resemblance, but the B Spot actually delivers. The fries there are incredible and only $1 during happy hour... and I've never ever had a bad burger there. Finally, there's the pickle bar which takes their burgers from great to crave-worthy. This place has the B Spot concept (a la carte burgers and fries, milkshakes with optional booze, etc.) and charges B Spot prices but doesn't come close in execution. That being said, they have a good attitude and could make changes to earn more stars."}
{"text":"Holy. Shit.  That's all I can say through my mouth-gasm. I died and came back to life so that I could eat again. Just go eat here. Eat the bacon things. And love life more for it."}
{"text":"True story. This one time, a vegan walked into a burger joint...  I stopped in with a group of 6 for a later dinner on a Wednesday night. As others have mentioned, I was kind of surprised to see how tiny the dining room is in comparison to the bar area, but...Melt has done that at their restaurants and it's worked out just fine, so what do I know?  Our server was a goofy teenage kid. Yes, kid. Based on the way he acted, I'm guessing this might be his first job ever? Someone asked for a beer recommendation, and he wasn't able to give us one, because he was underage. 0_o But that was ok, I guess? I ordered a ginger margarita type drink and others ordered beer. The woman sitting next to me ordered a Butterfinger milkshake. My drink was fine once it arrived. My poor served kind of sloshed it around on the way to the table and I could see it spilling with every step. You can't really mess up a beer, and I have to admit, the milkshake looked pretty damn good.  The bad thing about Grind Burger is the pricing, IMHO. (besides the super long wait for food when the restaurant seems to be empty) I'm not cheap. I'll pay for good quality food. But based on what everyone said, their burgers were good but not great. And they come without any sides, which is a little odd. When the burgers arrived on the plate, I commented that they should have thrown something on the plate as a garnish. It just looked...odd? Pretty much everyone ordered a side of fries - meant for 2. (for $5 or $6) I'm not sure where the owners are from, but the side of fries was more like a single serving. And they were super salty!! My fiance ordered the truffle fries, thinking they'd have truffle oil or cheese or something, but they were just served with a truffle sauce on the side. Weep womp. (they're also not fresh fries because they contain gluten - real fries made out of actual potatoes just contain potatoes) My fiance also thought his bun was stale and only ate the bottom half.   I ordered the ridiculously named Yummy Yummy salad. I felt like saying, \"can I have the yummy yummy in my tummy,\" but I thought that might be too much for our server to handle. I ordered it without cheese to veganize it. The salad was made up of shredded kale, romaine lettuce, a couple tiny pieces of nuts, and 4 half strawberries. It wasn't mind blowing, but it was solid.  Obviously, burger joints aren't my thing, so I won't be rushing back, but I would drop in for a beverage again. They have an extensive wine and beer list and offer a few dollars off drinks during happy hour. I'll just wait a little while to go back to they can work out their service issues..."}
{"text":"Ive been there several times, and have yet to have all the food served at once. They are close, but it is obvious, these aren't experienced restaurant operators. The server brought one or two plates at a time, and by the time we were half way through our meal the fries showed up. They need to have condiments on the table. Many cool and chic places do. We waited another 5 minutes for mustard. Waited way too long for food and check. As to the food, the burger was very tasty, but WAY to small. need to be at least 8 oz."}
{"text":"I can't believe I ate a burger this good. I got the spivey burger with the Wagyu meat.. Wow! My mind is blown! The bun is soft and a light so it doesn't make you too full or overpower the meat! They have fresh meat delivers everyday so you know it's real.   You have to eat here.    Honestly don't eat again until you eat here. Jut starve until you can make it here.  Oh! Also a good beer selection and really awesome employees. Modern and nice vibe, but dress casual. Good music selection, too!"}
{"text":"Very cool space.  Inviting, warm and comfortable.  Service was excellent.  Had the yummy yummy salad and it was yummy!  Also the triple truffle burger which was amazing.  Can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"Came here for lunch and was surprised how big and how nice it is inside. Very clean and nice decor. The staff was very friendly as well. The menu has a nice size list of burger options and non burger choices. As well as a build your own choice. Appetizers such as fried pickles and hot dogs and a large list of milkshakes that can have liquor added if wanted.   I ordered the aria burger. I wasn't  over overwhelmed with flavor and taste but it was good. The fried pickles on the burger didn't add much flavor and the garlic cheddar was barely noticeable as well as the thousand island dressing. The other person I was with ordered a burger his way in their \"lettuce cup\" which was just a couple pieces of romaine of a plate. Also added the Zinfandel onions which were good and American cheese which was barely noticeable.   We ordered a side of fries which were great and a large portion enough for more than 2 people. Also ordered the fried pickles which were just ok not the best.   We would come back to try something else on the menu as there are a lot of options."}
{"text":"Slow food service, incorrectly cooked burger, small portions and bad management.   They are going for a premium burger experience but fall way short.   If you are looking for a quality burger, check out flipside (or play in mayfield)  for truly gourmet burger experience."}
{"text":"Had the happy accident of preparing dinner the night before in a crock pot and then forgot to actually put it on. Soooo, eating out was the only option and we decided to try something new. Husband had heard good things about Grind Burger and away we went.  It was fairly slow when we got there but they have a really nice waiting area if you ever have to wait. The restaurant is small but because they didn't cram things in it, it looks and feels roomy and comfortable. Enough about the atmosphere. The BURGERS are amazing! The quality of beef they use is clearly evident and makes all the difference. I got the Aria burger and husband got the All the fixin's burger. We both loved them. We also got the onion rings (subtle sweet flavor) and the truffle fries. I'd be curious to try just the regular fries as the only difference I understood was the dipping sauce. Great and friendly service too. Also, they have a really good happy hour deal, $2 off drafts, special drinks, and bottles. You even get $2 of the 20oz options! A fantastic place, try it out, you will be happy you did!"}
{"text":"Finally, somebody gets it right. These guys know that a great burger starts with the meat, that's right, THE MEAT. I'm going to say that again. THE MEAT. I'm not sure why it has been so difficult in meat-laden NE Ohio to get an amazing burger up to this point? For me B spot is just kind of, meh, cashing in on the burger craze with sauces and sweets. These guys are burger savants, you can tell care was taken when thinking about how to give The People a great burger. Ambiance is nice, lots of tables and room to spread out. Would rate service a 4/5, the place was busy and our server handled our rather large, indecisive and scattered group with much more patience than even I could muster. But, really, I mean, The Burger. That is what we're talking about here. Order any of them, you can't go wrong. I had the Over Easy because an egg on a burger is good for you. My only suggestion would be to rename it the Over Eazy, because the milkshake (I didn't even get into that, not enough space...) and burger transported me back to my idyllic pre cell-phone teen years eating burgers and shooting hoops whilst pumping the NWA from my three-speaker boombox. (Google Boombox and NWA, youngsters.) Okay, so you're probably thinking \"what is this guy talking about?\" And my response is \"IT DOESN\"T MATTER BECAUSE THE BURGERS ARE THAT GOOD.\""}
{"text":"I liked it very much!  The atmosphere was nice and actually kind of relaxing.  What better to have for an appetizer than candied bacon!  I had the chicken and waffles sandwich which was a nice deviation for me from a burger.  The flavors were nice, but unfortunately, the dry and nearly flavorless waffle detracted from the chicken.  I took off the top half of the sandwich and then things were better.  The chicken was juicy and had a great flavor.  The dressing was lite and I applied some extra syrup from the bacon app.  The staff was competent and friendly.  I'll go back and try a burger next time, after all, it is called Grind Burger!"}
{"text":"I ordered the build your own Burger with Turkey, lettuce,Tomato,Cheddar and Onion rings I also Order the onion rings for my side order. My Girl friend got the Over Easy with Truffle fries. the food was pretty good but it was cold as heck in there. and  we would have gotten milkshakes but since it was too cold in there to get one. The floors were super greasy and slippery."}
{"text":"I have only eaten at three burger joints here in Cleveland bspot , b 2 b (meh)and here .I am afraid that bspot blows this one out of the water . Food was ok .One of the group ordered a 6$ bananas foster milkshake that had no flavor resembling bananas. Fries were a little greasy onion rings were very good. Over all I will round it up to a 3 . Service was good here but given a choice bspot will win outright.I was disappointed given all the positive yelp."}
{"text":"We really enjoyed this place for a number of reasons.  There was plenty of parking, and there was a nice environment going on inside. No dumb junk on the walls or crazy music blasting.  Everything looked good, so we had a difficult time deciding.  Eventually, we decided on drinks-a Viniq cocktail for me, a beer for the spouse and Red mule for my friend.  The cocktail price ($9) was a little ridiculous.  The bar prices are, in general,  a bit high.  Everything else was great, though!  Our server was speedy, nice, and gave us just the right amount of attention.  We skipped apps, and ordered Diablo and Aria burgers.   These burgers have a lot of flavor!  Dare I say it-better than B-Side!  I think the fresh bun from Davis bakery really makes these burgers fantastic.  The bacon was crispy, cut thick and was very lean, the cheese is high-quality and the pickles zesty.  The fries are cut fresh and are not overly seasoned, and the onion rings were also very good. There's a lot of flavor packed into these burgers without it being overwhelming.   I could only finish half the Aria burger, so my husband ate the rest after finishing his Diablo.  I recommend ordering an appetizer or salad if you have a large appetite.  The fires and onion ring portions are large enough for four people.  They also had some amazing milkshakes (some you could add spirits to), but we were stuffed! I really like this burger joint, and I will be back.  If you like B-Spot, chances are you'll love this place."}
{"text":"Decided to give this place another shot now that the patio is open.  Significantly better experience this time.  The patio is outstanding!!  I really enjoyed the herb planters and ample seating.  Server was attentive and got our order in a timely fashion.  Beers were cold, son loved the cookies and cream milkshake.  My guys each had burgers, each cooked to requested temps.  I ordered the skinny turkey burger (no bun) and a side of steamed cauliflower.  Turkey burger was spicy and tasty.  The cauliflower was crunchy, but slightly cool.  I would definitely patronize again."}
{"text":"Great food and not a chain place!  Great addition to the mayfield area.  Had the grind burger and split truffle fries,  will definitely return!"}
{"text":"Best burger I've ever had. We come here frequently. Cool atmosphere, and the patio is nice in the summer. Fries and desserts are also really good. Nice to have this nearby."}
{"text":"I've been sitting here for an hour and we haven't even gotten salads yet. There is one sever, a bartender and one cook. Apparently the manager left for the day before lunch hour rush. Disorganized chaos."}
{"text":"I have been to Grind Burger twice with friends. Both times I asked for a medium rare burger, which is supposed to be pink, it came close to well done both times. I would've set it back or told the wait staff , except I didn't want to make a fuzz in front of friends. The burger tasted fine, they use quality meat. The atmosphere is upscale as are the prices. If I go again i'ld ask for it rare, figuring they would over cook it to medium rare."}
{"text":"Great food and service. Above average beer list. The place is clean and has a good atmosphere. I think they lowered their prices recently. They were pricy before but now I think you get great value for the price. I will return, no doubt!"}
{"text":"12/5/14 we stopped in for another try. We were seated right away. Our server Anthony was awesome! Gourmet burgers were fantastic. We had the \"all the fixings\" burger. It is a mess but sooo f*cking delicious!  Fries and onion rings were. great. We will be back!  btw floors are slick so just be extra careful."}
{"text":"I was really in the mood to have a hamburger, so I thought this would be a good place to try.  I was not disappointed.  I got a \"build your own\" hamburger, and added chili, sour cream, cheese, bacon, lettuce tomatoes and pickles.  So good!  Even though I ordered my hamburger well done, it was juicy and not overdone.  The toppings were excellent quality and generous.  I should have ordered it without the roll, as I ended up using my knife and fork, anyway.  I also ordered the truffle fries.  Also excellent.  Hand cut fries with a truffle aioli accompaniment, overflowing in a very cute basket -- very nice presentation.  Needless to say, I had leftovers to take home, which were still good the second time around.  My companion had a salad with chicken on it, which he also enjoyed.  I'm looking forward to my next visit."}
{"text":"Meh. Terrible service. Food took 20 plus minutes to come out in a seriously empty restaurant.  More meh.  Food was mediocre.  Fries were crunchy and the portion, apparently \"for the table\", was skimpy and I'm not talking skimpy like you like your bathing suits.  So much meh I could basically write a book about it."}
{"text":"I love the concept of this restaurant. Decent burger selection, in addition to the ability to customize your own. Many things are created in-site.   Unfortunately, the actual meal was very underwhelming. I had the Burratta burger, my friend had the skinny Hot & Spicy. My burger was small and didn't fit the bun - a smaller bun would have been just fine.  The raspberry compote was overpowering, the Burratta cheese was just a tiny square in top and got lost.  My friend's burger was ok, but not hot or spicy. Both burgers lacked any real flavor in the meat itself. He also ordered the roasted veggies side which was just a bowl of roasted cauliflower swimming in butter.   I may try this place again, but after some kinks are worked out."}
{"text":"Hey y'all, Eric Nies here. And this is Da Groooiiinnnddd!!! You might remember me from such 90's cultural benchmarks as trying to deflower Julie the dancer on the first Real World and that workout tape I made. Wait, hold on a second. (heard off camera)Uh, huh. Ok. Yeah, no. Tell Dan Cortese to stop calling. I have a job now. And that job is busting moves here at Grindburger! (Murray enters) \"Yeah, can I get an original to go? Thanks.\"   Murray takes burger to car to eat with dog. \"Damn! This is a f*cking tasty slab of meat! Truffle aioli, manchego cheese, zinfandel onions! Holy hot damn!\" (wolfs down burger in minutes and goes into coma). Eric Nies approaches car...\"Hey, brother, can I get some of that or maybe just some change?\" Murray flings fifty cents at the doo-ragged imbecile has been. Eric shuffles back to Grindburger to continue pelvic thrusting. *warning: not every Grindburger experience is guaranteed to have a former MTV un-celeb in attendance."}
{"text":"In todays day and age of burger joints, this is just alright at best. Ten years ago this would have seemed impressive.  The inside is trendy and interesting, but maybe too much of a \"lounge\" to wait in.   The menu promised far more flavor, the fries might as well be from anywhere, and after the waitress warned us for a very juicy pink burger, we received hockey pucks.  They were great enough to replace them, but by then the fries were cold  as we waited to eat them w. the burgers.  and kids were  getting increasingly impatient.  I can get over a burger that was a little well done, but the flavorless accouterments were disappointing.    I can imagine it will continue to do a good business as its in an area w. very limited options, but not worth the 10 miles I drove to get there."}
{"text":"Solid burgers but a bit overpriced for what it is. Service is usually pretty slow so be prepared to wait."}
{"text":"Going to shoot it straight. Food tasted good, had a lamb burger, $15, pretty pricey to me. 3 people 3 burgers 3 waters 3 fries $60 for lunch... Ordered my burger medium rare, came very rare and even raw in the middle. Truffle fries were decent, but not killer. They came with a good dipping sauce. Stingey with the pickles, one little bitty chip. Expected more for the high price of the burger. Their claim to fame is to be the only place in Cleveland to \"double grind\" their beef. 1, doubt it. 2, whats the difference if you can't cook it properly..."}
{"text":"Amazing amazing burgers! Wow couldn't believe how great they were. I love the ambiance and how trendy The restaurant is. I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Slowest service ever! Ketchup? 10 minute wait. Salt and pepper? 10 minute wait. Beverage refill? 10 minute wait. Check? Yep. You guessed it! Food is average. Nothing special."}
