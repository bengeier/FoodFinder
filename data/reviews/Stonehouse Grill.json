{"text":"This place is my regular go-to when I need a bite. Consistently good food. I love their salads and waffle fries! Great family restaurant."}
{"text":"We've eaten there a dozen times because of the food quality and great service. After a one year absence, we returned to find that only the great service remains. All the side orders were stock - standard Sysco frozen crap, straight from freezer to fryer. My memory may be failing me but I thought their burgers were hand pressed and delicious.  For $11.00 they certainly should be.  But instead, the two different burgers that arrived at our table were pre-formed  frozen junk, again pulled from the depths of the freezer. The burger toppings were carelessly assembled. The buns were homemade and phenomenal. The pizza, too, seems to have suffered from just plain ambivalence.  Overall there is a feeling that nobody really and truly is putting forth any effort into the food...just kind of going through the motions. It's a tough business, to be sure, and quality and consistency is not easy to maintain day in and day out. But for the forseeable future, at least, they can count me out."}
{"text":"Usually like the food but tonight was Mexican and it was NOT good."}
{"text":"This place deserves NOTHING. NO STARS. 

Seated right away at a high top table by the bar with uneven seats that drive me nuts. Potato skins to start off were ok. Date ordered a cup of tomato bisque which was watery. Timing of serving the appetizers could have been alot better, soup was finished way before the skins arrived. We both ordered the two deluxe burgers with fries. When they arrived they were as specified. Major problem I'm still trying to figure out is the beef used for the burgers. Upon cutting the burger in half to eat it the juice had already soaked the bun and made it soggy. We both requested medium, however the meat was cooked, but in a really odd way. While you would expect some pink to a burger when ordering it medium, there was no pink whatsoever. It was a thorough brown. Wasn't well done or burnt at all. The taste was rubbery and bland and hard to swallow due to all of the cheese, soggy bread and really odd texture of the beef. So I picked the burger apart and discovered the patty to have this even line through the middle that split the patty directly In half. I guess the only way to describe this is if you took one party, flattened it, then do it again with another patty and combine the two. The weirdest thing. After that combined with the taste I highly suspect the meat was of the microwaveable variety. Didn't finish what was left of it after that. Fries we're mediocre at best. Was expecting fresh cut fries like there \"sister restaurant AJs Urban Grill\" but was met with store bought crinkle cut fries. AJs was no better. Food disappointing to say the least. Do not plan on returning. Especially after some halfwit jackass stood directly next to our table to watch the tv above us, why he couldn't watch the tv that was DIRECTLY ABOVE HIS TABLE SHOWING THE EXACT SAME THING is beyond me."}
{"text":"Great service and great food! I go here a few times a month with my grandmother and mom. The apple mule drink is very good! I usually get a cheeseburger or a steak but sometimes get the cod on Fridays."}
{"text":"First time there last night.  Nice cozy place. Pricey.  I had the artichoke dip with chicken added, not good at all.  Husbands burger was ok.  Bartender was sweet."}
{"text":"This is a wonderful little spot. When I am in or around westlake I always stop. Really good food and reasonable prices, a must stop over all the chain type restaurants."}
{"text":"Comfy and warm atmosphere. Food and service is great. Wait times can be high, so come at off hours because parking can get tricky and waiting space during winter is tight. Otherwise great go-to for me."}
{"text":"The food is good, the atmosphere is nice and cozy, staff is great but the prices are ridiculous!!!"}
{"text":"My aunt lives in Westlake and told me about this place. She has treated me to this place twice and I have loved it both times. The service excellent and I so love their patio.

The food is wonderful and they have a great menu to choose from!"}
{"text":"It's a convenient spot for lunch as it is next door to my office.  I've only had their pizzas and meatball sub.

The meatball sub is what keeps me going back.  The pizzas have been slightly above average at best.

Check out the patio when the weather is nice!"}
{"text":"One of my fave burger and fries place.  They have crinkle cut fries, waffle fries, and sweet potato fries.  The burgers are huge and just about always taste very much like steak.  They are cooked exactly as ordered.  Wait staff very pleasant and helpful and competent.  Price for burger and fries starts at $9.49 and I believe goes up to about a dollar more for specialty burgers.  If you need a quick burger to go, this place is a good choice.  Quality is consistent."}
{"text":"This is a classic go to in my household. Great American food, salads, sandwiches, and dinner entrees are all phenomenal. Not the biggest fan of their Mexican night but everything else is a go. The weight staff is also super kind and the owner is always there!"}
{"text":"This is one of my college friends favorite restaurants who grew up in the area, so the first few times I would come see her she would always take me here.  I may have started off a little biased but I do enjoy it.  Much more of a quick place I would go for lunch compared to a night out for dinner though.  

I have tried quite a few different options from here, the Buffalo Chicken Salad is one of my favorites, but let me tell you if you say you like it hot, it will come out HOT!  They make all their own bread so their subs are good for lunch, as well as their wraps are very large and flavorful.  

I have only ever had a fish dinner as their entree and it was good, and they never disappoint on servings.  The only downfall is their sides, they taste a bit on the frozen side with a lack of unique flavoring.  The bar is also not very extensive but they have the staples if you are looking for a beer or wine. 

If you don't feel like waiting to be seated and want something hot, it's definitely a good go to."}
{"text":"I stopped in for a quick meal. Some garlic parmesan wings. They really were rather disappointing. Neither garlic nor parmesan was very evident. I may try again with an entree on another occasion."}
{"text":"Local pub and grub place with lots of fried food. 

Mondays are a deal with $2.00 big beers and an inexpensive short buffalo wing themed meal list including wings. salad and wrap etc."}
{"text":"Simple pleasures from a well-priced location. My family and I used to come here a lot after church. (11AM church on Sundays gets you out just in time for when they open at noon). Their service is quick, especially because they're not usually too too busy. Their food is simple but well done. I always love their buffalo chips and buffalo wings. They're fried so well but never oily. Kinda wish their hot sauce would be a little more spicy but I appreciate what I get for how much I pay.

Anyway, we visited again a few days ago on a whim and man do I miss this place! makes me fall for it all over again.

Good location, outside patio too (although I've never eaten outside)
Ooh their happy hour beers are cheap too!"}
{"text":"Been to Stonehouse about a dozen times, one of my favorite lunch/dinner spots in Westlake. The staff across the board (hostesses, waitresses, bartenders) are very friendly and welcoming, not to mention provide excellent service. 

The place is extremely clean and welcoming, a good sign when you walk in to a neighborhood restaurant. The food is very good at a reasonable price. I recommend the burger or the New York strip steak salad (two of my favorites) and throw in a cup of their tomato bisque, you will not be disappointed. 

I would check it out for lunch or a weekday dinner, it is always packed during dinnertime on the weekends."}
{"text":"Get the BBQ bacon cheeseburger. Or the pizza. Or the pork chops. Wow."}
{"text":"This place is a hidden neighborhood gem. Stonehouse is an excellent place for simple yet great tasting dishes - from sandwiches to burgers to wraps. Where they shine the most, is in the Pizza section. Their white sauce pizza is to die for. The bbq chicken pizza is not too saucy nor dry  All their specialty pizza are great to try and share. The Pizza is always fresh made upon ordering. If you like French fries - their version of Sweet potato fries are hard to match. The right crisp factor.  My favorite are their cross cut waffle fries.

Stonehouse has a full service bar that is placed centered in a mostly open searing layout.  There always seems to be 5 beers on tap. The mixed drinks are standard faire of martini (nothing to write home about). Some standard wine offerings.

The seating contains tall bar tables for cozy two people seating to booths on the other end for family / group seating to freestanding tables. They also have a small but decent patio during warm weather.  Only a few spots of parking in the front with significantly more spaces in the back. 

The wait staff are always friendly and if you are a repeat customer they remember you. The service is friendly and attentive.  Friday nights & especially Saturday dinner time is always packed. The restaurant isn't very big a good thing from crowd perspective but bad from wait for a table perspective, during busy weekend nights. The wait is worth it."}
{"text":"Checked this place out for lunch. Opened the place at 11:15.  Good fast service. The food was good too. I had a sausage Parmesan sub. It was like a deconstructed pizza. Very tasty. Prices were average to high.  Fries are extra. Subs come with Chips. Very happy. Will return.  When we left the parking lot was getting full.  It's too bad it took me so long to check this place out."}
{"text":"Just got back from dinner. Nine of us went. It was Mexican night and two of us got the taco. It was shaped like a burrito and they were mainly filled with lettuce. One was with chicken and the other was with shrimp. Both were very bland. Two people got the chicken fajitas and there was hardly any chicken and also very bland. One crusted perch sandwich was ordered and the fillet was so small it could have been eaten in one bite. A taco sub was ordered and there was almost no beef on it.  Very disappointing. The only two items that were acceptable were the steak salad and the enchilada. Our service was great and everyone was very friendly. Probably will not be going back."}
{"text":"Not sure what expectations others might have, here's what we have grown to like about Stonehouse. Courteous servers - we have always had good service. The servers are fast to refill your drink and remember your orders from previous visits. Very nice. Solid bar food - burgers, wings and pizza. I like burgers to be medium-rare and wings very crispy, and they haven't failed to properly cook these items, and we have been there dozens of times. For what it is, it is great. Want a gourmet meal? Go somewhere else. Want a quick meal served by a friendly waitress? Try Stonehouse."}
{"text":"THAT was one FREAKEN GOOD hamburger!!!!!
Went there for a  work lunch and we also had apps that included buffalo dip with chips and spicy potato chips and they were good but the burger I had was simply delish!~
Cooked a spot on medium and it was piled high with EVERYTHING!!! (I think an egg was in there as well but couldn't tell with all the toppings!
Note this...It wasn't a sloppy mess that you sometimes have to deal with a burger of this magnitude... the crinkle cut French fries were fresh and hot and stayed that way throughout the meal which really...NEVER happens!!
In a nut? Find yourself a way to get here and see if I am spot on or have my head up my butt!!!!!!
Cheers!!!!"}
{"text":"the worst burger I have ever eaten.  if you like frozen, synthetic protein binding burger patty, then this place is for you.  If you are someone who knows anything about food, flavor and quality, then you will run from this place.  I am serious when I say, it has got to be the worst quality food that is out there.  please dont waste your money.."}
{"text":"Came in for a late lunch. Very attentive service. Clean and enjoyable atmosphere.  I had the steak extravaganza sub and was blown away by the deliciousness. Rounded out with the key lime cheesecake-- perfectly balanced sweet and tart. Very impressed and we will definitely return!"}
{"text":"Stonehouse is convenient but not a daily or weekly go to.   It is just ok.  Bar is small and in the middle of a family atmosphere.  Food is just a little better than bar food.   Nothing special.   Just ok."}
{"text":"This is an outstanding restaurant for many reasons! My husband and I stumbled across it one night and we can't get enough of it! It's always busy, but we usually get seated quickly. The patio is excellent, the menu is large and the staff is friendly. The food is always good. The one downside is that service is a little slow. I would highly recommend this restaurant, as it's moderately priced and the menu is pretty diverse."}
{"text":"This place has such a cozy, local feel and it's comfortable. I have been twice and had two different food experiences so I gave 3 stars for inconsistency. First, I had potato skins as my meal and they were very good (small potatoes). They were cooked through, enough cheese, hot, and the cold sour cream was great too. 

The second time, my roommate and I shared the BBQ chicken pizza. We had seen people order pizza and it looked delicious. The crust was good! Doughy but not too much, medium thickness, golden brown. BUT whoever made it put so much sauce, I mean probably 3/4 CUP of BBQ sauce. It was not good. Also, the sauce was clearly jarred sauce and not even the good stuff (would have been pleased with sweet baby rays sauce on it). We literally each had one piece of a large pie, which cost $17, and didn't even ask for a box to take the remaining 8 pieces home. Not the type to complain for my money back bc of too much sauce (could be personal preference). But the waiter didn't even question why we weren't taking 8 pieces of our large pie home.. Hmm. 

I'd still go back and just try something else but it didn't blow me away. I'll try again."}
{"text":"My favorite place to go with exceptional service and something for everyone.  The lobster Mac and cheese is amazing!  Steaks have a nice rub and the red Zinfandel sold by the glass is a nice compliment."}
{"text":"Well my wife and I have driven by Stonehouse many times and we were trying to figure out someplace different to go for dinner.  We chose Stonehouse as we had heard it wasn't and place.

It isn't a bad place, just wasn't a WOW like some places.  Would we go back, yeah, just to try something else and hopefully find the right thing to eat.

I wish I could give SG a 2.5. But we can't so a 3 star will work.

Service was good.  Very fast in fact!  Which was great on a busy Saturday night. Staff was friendly and the atmosphere was good.  Very inviting and comfy.  

We ordered the bacon/cheese fries.  Which were very good, just needed some more flavoring.  

The salad I asked for was a garden salad with tomatoes and onions. I asked for a Ceasar. Which has none of those.  The dressing was correct. Which was an ok flavored stock brand.  

They had a Valentines Day special-6oz bacon wrapped fillet.  Well, the bacon was torched black and pretty inedible. Fortunately my wife didn't want hers, and hers was slightly undercooked.  The fillet was slightly undercooked for my medium request.  The mashed potatoes were cold.  

My wife's food was ok as well.  That's just it, the food was OK.  Not bad, not great.  Right in the middle.  Again, we are going to go back as we heard their pizzas are pretty good."}
{"text":"Their spinach artichoke pizza is ah-maz-ing! Casual atmosphere. Friendly staff. Will definitely go back!"}
{"text":"First trip here and I have to say I enjoyed it. Small, cozy, nice lighting, but with TV's at the same time.  Food was pretty good, price was good, and even had half off bottles of wine tonight.  The fun part was the wine doggy bag you get with wine you didn't drink.  I will definitely return."}
{"text":"I just moved to this neighborhood (right down the street in fact) and was eager to try out the Stonehouse Grill, simply for the fact of how cute it looked. I ordered take-out, and for what I paid, the incredibly greasy, sloppy cheeseburger I got fell drastically short of expectations (I guess I was expecting a gourmet-type burger?). The teenagers who took my order and produced my food seemed bored (love a bored teenager, nothing like a bored teenager), and the food reflected it. The waffle fries are LEGIT, but not enough to bring me back."}
{"text":"Like my review for A&J 's as this is the same owner this review is similar. Nice and homey. However cramped. They seat from the hostess stand at the high tops in the bar which are way too close to each other. If you are over 150 pounds best to ask for a table or a booth. You wont be fitting in these comfortably. Again with A &J's cute servers does not mean brains. Maybe that is common in New York where the owners come from.  But us young foodies and soon to be restaurant owners would like to see some men in the front of the house too."}
{"text":"Horrendous experience.  Called in at 9:00, asked how late they're open and if they're still serving food.  They said \"10:00\".  We showed up at 9:30 and obviously they didn't want any more customers.  Condisending attitude from the hostess.  We asked if it was Mexican night, since we were told on the phone that it was and she goes \"I'll don't know I'll have to check\"....wait what?!?!? We walked out after they set us in the booth directly next to the front door on a freezing cold night with hardly anyone in the restaurant.  We instantly picked up on the obvious fact that we were unwelcome and drove 5 minutes down the road to a real restaurant."}
{"text":"Got here with a party of 7. Waited for an hour. Standing on our feet. Finally was able to sit and wait for another 40 and they came out saying it would be another 40 minutes.THEN they came back about 45 minutes later and said they would not be able to seat us. They could have saved us all time and aggravation and told us that to begin with. We had tired hungry children with us."}
{"text":"Been here several times over the years mainly because it is close by. The food is always good, but nothing really stands out other than the spicy tomato basil soup, which always seems to hit the spot. 

Service is usually good, but have been here when they seem to disappear in the kitchen too. 

They have a Mexican night on Wednesdays which I don't quite get. Most places that have this serve some good tacos cheap. The tacos here are $6.50 which is a bit high. All the Mexican menu items seem a bit overpriced although I have never ordered any to see if these prices are warranted."}
{"text":"Place has a nice outdoor patio if you enjoy sitting outside. The place inside is nice and clean. We ordered 2 large pizzas- a veggie and buffalo chicken. The pizza was good but nothing special. Certainly better then your typical fast food pizza chains but still was lacking something... I will say I'm very particular about my pizza. I prefer thin crust (real thin) this place wasn't thick but it wasn't really thin crust either. The 3 ppl I went with love the place and go every week... But, I just don't find the pizza here anything to write home about. 
Service was good though."}
