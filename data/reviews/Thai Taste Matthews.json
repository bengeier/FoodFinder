{"text":"We used to make the trek up to East blvd. until this one opened.  Always love the summer rolls, chicken in red curry sauce, and pad gra pow.  

However, the last two times we went (it has been a while, hesitant to go back) we had lower quality food.  First, my husband bit on a plastic disk found in a mouthful of rice. When we told the manager (we had been there several times and she recognized us) she simply claimed that happens and made no reparations. The next time the chicken was tough and rubbery in the curry.  She blamed her cook who she said was Hispanic and therefore didn't know how to make Thai?

Think I will either make the trek to East for consistently good food and service or hit the local Thai in Blakeney for a quick bite."}
{"text":"They have a limited lunch menu by day and will let you order the Monday daily lunch on Tuesday-Friday. I have always had fast, friendly service and the food is always good. I eat here at least once a week"}
{"text":"I went there for lunch and tried chicken pad thai with 5/5 spicy level. It was not super super spicy but just enough. Price was fair for lunch. Entrees serve with an egg roll and soup. Yammy egg roll! Large enough portion while plates were small (i couldn't finish it).  It was walking distance in downtown Matthews from my office, so i will come back!"}
{"text":"This is our fifth time at Thai Taste and the food seems better every time. Truly great food and service our favorite Thai restaurant in Charlotte!"}
{"text":"I got the chicken pad thai and the food came out hot and timely. Everything had great flavor. Staff were very nice and the place had a nice ambiance. Portions were good, I had enough left over for another meal. This place is one of the better pad thai places in Charlotte."}
{"text":"I love this place, everyone is friendly the food is fast and delicious. The lunch menu is limited by day you can order off any day's menu. I love the Monday's basil stir fry and am happy I am able to order any other day. The Wednesday garlic stir fry is also very good. Lunch comes with soup and spring roll."}
{"text":"Beware! Norovirus!
My wife and I ate here and vomited all night long. We had diarrhea for a week. Do not ever eat here!!! Pukeville USA"}
{"text":"I have had dinner their twice and it was pretty good both times. I will be back.
ITs not easy to find truly good Thai food in Charlotte,  I'd say this is one of the best places."}
{"text":"SUCH a good place. Even on busy days, servers are happy to help anyone in need, food can be made to your desired heat level, and it's fast and very reasonably priced. Portion sizes are just right and the atmosphere is relaxed. Be prepared to keep coming back!"}
{"text":"Nope.  Just no...

Came here on a Friday.  Nice decor and cute area, but that means nothing when the food is crappy.  My boyfriend and I ordered the chicken meat skewers as an app.  That was the best part of the meal.  Good flavor, good sharing size for the two of us.  Next we ordered the pad see ew and the pad gra prow.  The pad see ew was the better of the two, but was watery, the vegetables were still cold (soppy, possibly frozen), and was bland.  The pad gra prow (also known as Thai basil) was a disgrace to all thai food.  First off, it should be served with ground meat, and BASIL!  It looked exactly like the pad see ew (minus the noodles). Same frozen, soppy, vegetables, cheap chunks of meat and no flavor!  Wow, what a disappointment."}
{"text":"I am surprised that this place hasn't been reviewed by any yelpers. The decor is nice  and has plenty of seatings. We ordered some fried tofu, and spring rolls as starters and they were really good. For the meal, we got green curry, pad Thai, drunken noodles and some fried rice. Everything tasted really good, and the spice level was perfect. I ordered my drunken noodles spicy and they actually came spicy, not just hot like some other Thai restaurants do. Service was good as well, our server was polite and attentive and made us feel welcome. Overall, I would recommend this place to everyone."}
{"text":"I enjoy going here for lunch.  I appreciate the simple lunch menu and the quick service.  I've been to the University location many times for dinner as well and the quality is consistent and the food is delicious."}
{"text":"We went to Thai Taste this evening and after waiting ten or fifteen minutes, having several waitresses look at us and keep on walking, and then watching people being waited on that came in after us, we got up and left. We have eaten here before, and the food is usually good, but after tonight's experience we won't be going back."}
{"text":"My husband and I ate lunch here for the first and last time 7/26/14.  Our waitress, who appeared to be the owner or manager, was very rude and argumentative.  She refused to even consider our one special request (steamed tofu instead of deep fried).  Her answers to all our questions were always  \"no.\"  She seemed to be doing us a favor when taking our order and bringing us the overcooked, BLAND, greasy, overpriced poor excuse for Thai food.  The women's bathroom was dirty and needs a complete renovation.  Thai Taste is awful compared to all the other Charlotte area Thai restaurants.  If you do decide to give it a try, don't order any shrimp dish.  The chef has no idea how to cook shrimp."}
{"text":"Best Thai food I've ever had! And I try a lot of Thai restaurants. Staff is very nice. Try the sesame chicken, fried rice and curry! Awesome!"}
{"text":"The BEST Thai ever!  Went there last night and had the soft shell crab with sesame sauce that was unbelievable.  It was one of the best dinners I have ever had.  We had reservations at 6:30 and it was packed, but we didn't have to wait.  My dinner partners had the crispy duck, which I tasted (very good) and one had the chicken with another sauce and both said they loved their choices.  Our server was very nice and the service was very good.  One thing I liked was you got to adjust the heat on any of the sauces.  Of course, mine was sweet!  I will be going back again.  It's a fabulous place."}
{"text":"Not only do I love this place, but I'm quick to send friends. The soft spring rolls are fresh and very authentic. The taste brings back memories of Southeast Asia. when within 30 miles and looking for Thai, this should be your first pick."}
{"text":"I really like the food, location and service.  Definitely worth a stop in Matthews.  I find it to be a great place to go when other places might have a long wait."}
{"text":"This food is always so delicious! The service is great and servers are friendly and patient. I love the location and pleasant atmosphere inside. The only thing I would add is a little slice of orange like some other Thai restaurants serve with their dishes."}
{"text":"Food was ok...not bad but not great.  Had a craving for Thai because I ate at Basil Thai restaurant earlier in the week and my food was so good.  Thai Taste in Matthews was closer to my home. I had never been to Thai Taste and decided to try it.  Probably my last time going to this restaurant."}
{"text":"Very good Thai food in downtown Matthews. My favorites are the pad Thai and yellow curry. Service is always fast even though its busy and the servers are friendly and attentive."}
{"text":"Thai Taste is my husband and my favorite restaurant.  We always look forward to Friday night Thai food, and we let Wan-Pen tell us what's good each time we visit.  She never lets us down!  We've eaten at all the Thai restaurants in South Charlotte, and this is our favorite!  Fresh tasting, spicy hot dishes with Thai beer - doesn't get much better.  The staff is very friendly.  I disagree with the reviewer who said there are no lunch specials because there ARE!  Our favorite dish is the red or green curry with chicken, \"drunken noodles\" and the fish special with basil sauce.  Appetizers are yummy too (chicken satay and spring rolls and dumplings, oh my!)"}
{"text":"Never in my life have I been ACCUSED of something when simply trying to pick up my to-go order! I walked in to retrieve my order of Pad Thai, to be confronted by a hostile, fire breathing woman asking me if I had written a negative review on the Internet because whoever did....placed an order similar to mine. I told her no, that it wasn't me...because surely there has to be another person on earth that has placed an order for meatless Pad Thai. She asked me again. I told her once more that it was not me. She then summoned an older women to the front where they exchanged foreign language shenanigans and at that moment, I no longer was ok with this bullying by little angry Thai women. It was also apparent that they had decided I was the guilty party before I even arrived, so I definitely was NOT ok with eating that (probably tampered with) food. I was a patron of this mediocre place because it was closer to me than Basil Thai...but from now on, I will drive further for better service and better food. And now....I definitely am writing a negative review and will shout it from the mountaintops that this place has horrible service with food that is extra average & should not be patronized!"}
{"text":"You certainly won't find any better Thai food in Matthews!  This is the sister of the East Blvd. location."}
{"text":"This is my ultimate favorite Thai restaurant in the Charlotte area. I've gotten everything from the apps, soups, noodles, curries, to the amazing mango with sticky rice, and it's all delicious! The service is really good, and they're located in the heart of downtown Matthews, so a great place to start an evening stroll."}
{"text":"Great location in downtown Matthews. Greeted and sat quickly. Very large menu with lots of choices. The wait staff was pleasant and attentive. The appetizer came out quickly, spring rolls, very tasty.  The spice level is from 1-5. I like spicy and went with a 3 to be safe, next time I will go 4 or maybe 5. It was very good but I like the spice!"}
{"text":"Wow worst Thai food I've ever had.  The pad Thai was way over sauced and came out within minutes which tells me it was not made fresh.  Really a disappointment."}
{"text":"I thoroughly enjoyed my food here, the vegetables were fresh and crunchy, service was very nice and helpful. 

I'm usually wary of the quality of Asian food after many bad experiences, but I was completely happy here. I had the vegetable green curry, which was delicious and surprised me with many different flavors of coconut, basil and lemongrass. My husband had a fried noodles dish with chicken and was also really happy. We'll be coming back here!

Edit: Came back again later, and realized that flavors don't vary very much between dishes. That was a little disappointing, but the food there is still good! 

Edit June 2013: Thai Taste of Matthews got a 93.5 health rating. Not so good."}
{"text":"I've only ever been to the other location on East but my office is somewhat close to here so we came in for lunch and we asked if they could do the Pud Se Ew even if it wasn't on the lunch menu. They told us absolutely and that they will make it whenever we want! Our food took all of 6mins to be out and it was delicious! We were in and out in 25mins! Service was really great and I can't wait to go back to this location!"}
{"text":"Very good food.  The spices are not as hot as other places so a 4 is pleasant if you like it spicy."}
{"text":"Pretty decent output here. Atmosphere is so-so.  Better options in Charlotte for Thai but this place is solid if you're in Matthews"}
{"text":"Love Thai Taste!!!!!!  Highly recommend!  The red chicken curry is my favorite.  Haven't had one thing I didn't love.  Service is excellent, best restaurant in Matthews and Charlotte!  Don't miss!"}
{"text":"Just ok. Periodically gets very low health dept ratings. I got an upset stomach (polite word for diarrhea) twice in a row after going there."}
{"text":"I'm not a big Thai food guy, but the Green Curry Chicken was delightful.  
I ordered it medium spicy (2 out of 5) and it was perfect for me: Spicy but not painful.  
Service was good.  
Disappointed in the limited selection of beers (no Miller nor Coors products?)."}
{"text":"I love this place! The food is always great and it comes out fast. The service is excellent and extremely attentive. I usually get the Pud Asparagus or the Kow Pud Sub Pra Ros (like a Thai fried rice). They are both really great! You get so much food for the price too. The soup is great and so are the spring rolls. They ask how spicy you want it and always make it exactly how I ask. They also have hot sauces you can add yourself to give it a little kick. Stop by this location or one of the other Charlotte area spots. You won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"Have been a few times now.  Discovered that you can get items not on the specials lunch menu from the regular menu - just gotta ask.  Our service was great, the food was great (Kaprow), and they serve cold or Hot Sake which is an added bonus.  Will definitely be taking my friends and family here!"}
{"text":"Went for lunch on Satruday. The food was good/tasty but the portions were very SMALL compared to other Thai restaurants. We probably will go to the other Thai restaurants before we come here again."}
{"text":"We have eaten here several times. Good food and value. The pad Thai is legit and the portions are large. If it's mango season, make sure you get a mango sticky rice!"}
{"text":"I have eaten at Thai Taste on East Blvd many times and it is delicious. However, I ordered from the Matthews location tonight and will NEVER go back. The food was terrible. I asked for peanut sauce with my appetizer, which I've had before, but there was clearly something wrong with it. When I opened the container, it was congealed and looked really gross. I tried mixing it but nothing helped. When I turned the container upside down, it didn't even come out; it just stayed stuck to the bottom. I called the restaurant to let them know but they told me I needed to heat it up. I've never done this before but I decided to try it anyway. I will attach some pictures to show you what it looked like after I heated it up. I called the restaurant back and they were extremely rude and insisted there was nothing wrong with it. They basically told me that the next time I order my appetizer, just to take the sauce that comes with it instead of asking for the peanut sauce. Terrible food and awful customer service. Do not eat at this restaurant!!"}
{"text":"My girlfriend has serious food poisoning from eating at this restaurant.  All she had was veggies and tofu and they still somehow managed to make her sick.  I've heard other people talk about how unclean this place is, but unfortunately we went anyway.  I got the pad thai and it was NOT GOOD.

Do not eat here, for your own safety."}
{"text":"The venue itself is pretty nice and they have a friendly staff. 

It's a shame we were in a rush and waited close to 10 minutes for someone to even ask us what we wanted to drink. We walked over to Bean Town across the street instead.

Looks like there are some great reviews and I hate to go against the grain, but I thought that was a little much for a nice sit down joint like it appears to be. Will be sure to try again."}
{"text":"Thai Taste has good reason to be the oldest Thai restaurant in Charlotte; its bursting with flavors, very attentive wait staff, and reasonably priced.  I recently visited the Matthews location (across from Beantown Tavern and the public library) and I was filled and fulfilled with what I ate.

My friend and I began with the spring rolls. crispy and not saturated in oil.  Our waitress explained the different lunch specials and combinations of meats (4 meats and tofu) and curries (three of varying heat).  I ordered the sesame chicken lunch special.  Unlike sesame chicken at Chinese restaurants, the sauce was not at all heavy and sweetened beyond recognition.  The chicken was white meat and lightly fried, covered with a spicy, sweet sauce and fresh broccoli florets, served with a large bowl of clumpy white rice.  I sipped on hot jasmine tea from a small kettle, which the waitress replaced twice and offered a third refill.  Who does that?

For $14, I think is a great place to get a \"catch up\" meal with a friend.  If you eat too much, you can always walk it off in downtown Matthews.  Kudos, Thai Taste!"}
{"text":"I met family here for dinner and was generally underwhelmed. Our party of five was seated quickly as we arrived on the earlier side of dinner.  The restaurant did fill up near the end of our meal though so consider dining early to avoid the wait.

We were asked for drink orders quickly, but it took some time for the drinks to arrive and actually place the order. I ordered a beer, but it never came.  By the time the sever remembered I was nearly finished with dinner so I didn't want it. Luckily, she remembered to remove it from the bill. 

We split an appetizer of mi krop crispy noodles. This is a fun dish when it is prepared well - crispy, sweet from tamarind, and complimented by chicken, tofu, or other protein. Unfortunately, this version was dry and the little pieces of chicken were hard and basically inedible. 

For the main course, my family ordered a mix of noodle, curry, and stir fried dishes. The food seemed to arrive as ready, which is good for temperature but one member of our party had to wait while others started. My mom ordered the pad thai and said it was really dry and extremely spicy for a medium order. She actually didn't eat very much, which was a bummer as I love nothing more than to treat my mom to a fantastic dinner. My sister was about half way through her panang curry when she found a hair in her meal. She was pretty grossed out! 

The stir fry dishes were fine. Nothing great or horrible, except everyone seemed to find them very salty."}
{"text":"Really good Thai restaurant in the heart of downtown Matthews. Nice atmosphere, hospitable staff and great menu. Certainly not the best Thai food I have ever had, but nice to have something close to the house in South Charlotte/Matthews."}
{"text":"This is one of the best Thai restaurants in Charlotte. I have visited this restaurant quite often in the past 5 years. I don't think that you will be disappointed in their food."}
{"text":"We have eaten here now 3-4 times. It is terrific. Nice ambiance. Owners/staff are from Thailand. Very courteous and welcoming. Great service.

Most importantly, the food is absolutely delicious! Just did take out tonight. Super efficient.

Yum. Highly recommend. Enjoy!"}
{"text":"I love Thai taste! I always get the pad Thai lunch. It's a great value because it comes with soup and a spring roll. Be warned: their food is spicy! I always order a 1/5. The reason I knocked off a star is because I wish they were more consistent with their spice. Sometimes I get a 1/5 and it's totally fine. Other times, it's so spicy I can't even finish it all! Despite this, it's hands down my favorite Thai place in Charlotte. Great food, great value."}
{"text":"ROASTED CRISPY DUCK!
SO good, i don't even know where to begin. All of their coconut based curry dishes are incredible. Although,my favorite has to be the Gaeng Kua Curry with the pineapples. Chicken, Shrimp etc... all are great in the curries however, the ROASTED CRISPY DUCK really just stands out above them all. I have had duck many times at other Thai restaurants. I thought it was good at those, this doesn't even compare its so much better. Its heavenly. The roasted skin stays crispy the entire time its in the curry, while the inside is still super  tender. I cannot even express accurately how amazing this dish is. I was inspired to write haiku's about it after trying it for the first time. So good it inspires poetry!
I find the portion sizes to be prefect, the ingredients are super fresh and the dishes have a good amount of spice heat to them. Although, i could very easily go wayyyy beyond the 5 rating. 
The service is always very prompt and friendly. I'd also say the prices are very reasonable for the quality of dishes served. When food is this good i've got no problem shelling out the dough."}
{"text":"Sorry, but this place is noir worthy of anything other than 1 star today.   We,  (2) have been here 10 minutes waiting for a server.   I finally got up too see the person who say us.  I told her wet had been there 10 minutes and no one had come to take out order.   She then proceeded to get attitude,  like I was  inconvenient to be in her place is business.   I dearly logged this place but with them being shut down a few months ago,  and now tonight,  I will travel into ballentyne to Basil Thai 1st."}
{"text":"Pad Thai with chicken. Love it. One of my favorite spots for lunch in Matthews."}
{"text":"Pad Kee Mow, close enough for four yelp stars.  Ordered without Egg, served WITH Egg, still real good!  The way they cooked the egg is the way I would cook the egg for this dish or for Pad Thai or any stir-fried dish!  This was the best meal I have eaten at Thai Taste (the last one was shortly after they opened this location years ago).  The Pad Kee Mow carries the stars (4 yelp stars) for this dine!  The service was good though I usually do not add or subtract stars or even fractions of stars for service good or bad!  So good service does not increase their rating though the rest of the food could bring the rating down, I'm over looking it this time!

The Chicken Satay was A-OK close to 3 yelp stars.  The Peanut Sauce was better than most, though not as good as the best ones - 3.2 stars.  This means I would not order it again. 

The soup and the spring roll were included in the meal and would NOT get 3 stars, maybe two, though I do not let \"throw-away\" items effect the overall rating of the meal most of the time including today!

Great Dinning Room, almost a Sun-room.  Glass around three sides shows off the outdoor patio! The Decor is Simple, not gaudy!  I like both Simple and gaudy, though I prefer Simple!  If I were giving stars for how the place looked I would say this place has potential and the stars would not effect today's dine rating!  Usually the way a place looks does not effect my yelp rating."}
{"text":"I've been to Thai Taste on East Blvd many times and have had great food every time. Tonight I decided to place a to go order from this location because it was on my way home from work. I was thoroughly disappointed with the quality food. I ordered pad thai with chicken and when I got home it was so dry and tasted so disgusting that I couldn't even eat it! I was not even given a lime with the to go order. I'll always go to the East Blvd location, but this will be my last visit to the Matthews location."}
{"text":"This being my first trip, I went basic with the Seafood Pud Thai with the Thai Iced Tea. 

Now firstly, the service was surprisingly commendable given I didn't expect much after I was told on the phone while ordering that I couldn't be told the total because they were busy. In restaurant, I was given my take out order quickly. That was perhaps aided by the fact I was wearing my work uniform complete with a name tag. Still it was good. The server was cordial and I have nothing at all to add that could have made me more comfortable.

On to the food! This was my first exposure to Thai food so I really don't have much of a basis for comparison. But you have to start somewhere and for me that somewhere was the most famous dish out there: Pud Thai. It was more flavorful than I expected as I'd always heard Thai cuisine placed an emphasis on balance. With the added sweet and spicy sauce however the only balance this dish had was the balance between delicious and tasty."}
{"text":"We have been going to Thai Taste for over 14 years.   Love the curry and the Pad Thai is some of the best I have ever had.   Servers are also very friendly and accommodating.  If I could give them 6 stars I would."}
{"text":"Love this place. It's adorable and the service is always friendly and personal. We have had the soft shell crab special and it's amazing. I also love the gaeng massaman. We enjoy date nights here often."}
{"text":"The food here is getting worse as time goes by. Yelpers like to lay claim to the \"Best in Charlotte\", well here I had the WORST Pud Thai lunch in Charlotte! 

I asked for 5 star hot and I got medium hot as expected, not well mixed in either,  it was \"hotish\" parts , totally mild in others.  In itself not a big deal but overcooked needle thin noodles, no ground peanuts, hardly any sprouts ... it was bland bland bland, had no flavor whatsoever other than...salt and sweetener, as in high fructose corn syrup. 

Personally, I felt it was an insult for them to pass this crap as Pad Thai, but they seem to know their clientele and what they can get away with.

I forgot to mention that rice soup ( a facsimile of Gerber's baby soup) is included with the lunch"}
{"text":"The best Thai food I've had....ever. For the past 4 years, I've eaten here every 8-10 weeks (I would eat here more if my eating-out budget allowed.)

Pad Thai, (level 3 spicyness) is fantastic. Fried Rice: great. The beef & chicken skewers with the coconut dipping sauce is addiction forming :) 

I ALWAYS finish my meal with Mango Sticky rice. Sometimes, I just head there for this desert treat alone.  The staff is always exceptionally friendly & accommodating.

I love cooking at home, and will often learn how to many of the dishes I enjoy at restaurants. Thai Taste is the exception; I simply cannot match the ambience, food,  and staff experience at home. That's what eating out should be all about, right?

Love Thai Taste."}
{"text":"The only place I will order chicken pha Thai. The staff is super friendly and even knows me by face. Super cute place in matthews. I bring my dog in the patio in the spring"}
{"text":"OH. MY. GOD. THAI TASTE IS THE BEST. Seriously, their food is amazing. While it does take a while for the food to come out, I can assure you the wait is worth it. I have eaten at Thai Taste many times and I have never left disappointed. I recommend the classic Pad Thai with chicken. The ambience is true to the Thai culture and the service is excellent. Seriously, I love this place."}
{"text":"Had a large family dinner take-out from here. We ordered several dishes and everything was delicious. We enjoyed the Curry Chicken, Gra Tiem Prig Thai, Thai Taste Fried Rice (sooooo delicious), and a number of noodle and rice dishes. Bottom line...EVERYTHING was gone and we fed 12 people for UNDER $100!!!"}
{"text":"Okay - so I didn't go in - can't speak for the decor - we were at the Carolina Beer Temple across the way and ordered take out - the fried tofu was pretty dang good - had a nice nutty flavor. The summer rolls were a bit bland except for the basil, which is pretty much all you could taste. The Massaman chicken curry was out of this world though - brought my experience up from 3 to 4 stars when I tried it. Hope to go back and visit both places again. Every neighborhood needs a good Thai restaurant. Am I right, or am I right?"}
{"text":"Excellent!  Service was great.  You can order your food to the spicy level you prefer.   They ask 1-5 rating for heat and I asked for very spicy (5) and was so happy to actually get a fabulously flavored SPICY Pad Thai.   The food came right out and was super hot.  I never like getting food served warm.  It has to be the best Pad Thai I've ever had.  What a great find!"}
{"text":"After bookmarking this place, I decided to try their green curry as its my favorites Thai dish next to Pud prig gra paw.  It was located in the cute area of Matthews.  I ordered green curry with \"a\" spring roll.  The receiver had issues hearing my order and I called back to ensure she had my spring roll request.  The spring roll wasn't on the online menu so I figured $10.95 plus $2.  My meal was $16 and change.  I get home and I have 4 spring rolls with my meal.  My meal was bland.  It had a nice serving of veggies but not enough seasoning.  Back home they give a 16oz of highly seasoned and creamy green curry with thick pieces of bamboo shoots, green & red peppers.  The spring roll sauce was good."}
{"text":"Staff was amazing but the food was up and down. The coconut chicken curry was absolutely delicious and the portion size was good for the price. I got it pretty (4/5) spicy and it had the perfect amount of heat. Someone else ordered the Pad Thai at my table and it was definitely off and we ended up barely touching it. Definitely wouldn't order that again. Plum wine was very sweet but tasted very good and was something I've never tried before. You get jolly ranchers with your check which was a first for me after a meal. Staff was the highlight of the meal, they are very friendly and quick."}
{"text":"Best currently open Thai food in Charlotte area that I have experienced to date.  They honored my request for native Thai spice on the last several occasions.  

Great food, value and service with pleasant atmosphere.  We will be back for more!"}
{"text":"Starters were mediocre, the spring rolls were nothing but iceberg lettuce and one shred of carrot and the steamed dumplings were rubbery, freezer burn tasting.  
I give it two stars bc the beef salad was delicious, perhaps bc it was freshly prepared."}
{"text":"Wow.  I'm still surprised at how little transplants and visitors to Charlotte know about food.  Following stints living in San Francisco, Atlanta, Dallas and even Indianapolis, as well as frequent travels all over the US on both my own dime and my employer's (and a lot of cooking cuisine at home from around the world), I've found Yelp less useful for upfront reconnaissance here than anywhere else I have traveled or lived for precisely this reason.  After 2 years here, the overabundance of petty complaints and unfair assessments never ceases to amaze me.  Everyone is entitled to an opinion, but when a review starts with \"I've never had ____ food before, but this was awful...\", \"I get Thai 'cause I love spice...\" or \"I don't know anything about ___food...\" , that should tell the reader to scroll down.  But I digress.  This location of Thai Taste benefits from a small, cozy interior, comfortable outdoor seating and gracious service from both the staff and owner.  More importantly, the food is authentic (yes, Americanized, but not unduly so given its location), the ingredients are fresh and the menu is focused but complete.  You won't find the amateur-night, calling-it-in Thai flaws of oily beef, overcooked chicken, overused fish sauce, cornstarch sauces or gristle/gristle/gristle here. Just straightforward Thai cooking the way it should be served in most cities in the US.  Take a look at my other reviews for spots YOU also like before you take my word for it, though.  AND...peel back the onion of the reviewers who assigned few stars here - and anywhere else you're thinking of visiting."}
{"text":"From the first time I walked into this establishment, it felt like any other Thai restaurant. To be honest, it tasted the same as well.  That isn't an issue because I love Thai foods, but it didn't give me a big wow factor. The service was prompt and friendly with a rather large staff which I just have to assume is family-based or closely associated. While they provided all the necessities and worked efficiently and diligently, there wasn't a feeling of pushiness.  The location itself felt like a nice neighborhood and the atmosphere is quiet and pleasant.

The food, as I said earlier, was decent and had good flavor. My only complain would be the amount of peanuts in the papaya salad.  The pad see yew was good with the traditional broccoli and egg flavors but it seemed to lack a strong noodle base.  The pork stir fry was good but it didn't really come with enough rice.  For me, each of these complaints are very minor issues as I think of myself as a bit more particular than the average person."}
{"text":"I get Thai cause I love spice. Therefore, if I asked for 3/4 or 4/5 .....I expect something with at least a BIT of chili paste. Could have given my food to a 1-year old and wouldn't have had a blow out diaper. 

Food was at least fresh.


Just had the sticky rice with Mango. At least they got that right"}
{"text":"Hands down the best Thai in Charlotte (only been to the Matthews and East Blvd locations)  Their Pad Thai is some of the best i've had.  I really like their spring rolls too.  We like to get two affordable appetizers, then split an entree.  

If i'm being picky, they don't have the best lettuce wraps, but they aren't bad, i've just had better at other locations."}
{"text":"The wait staff was so friendly, you felt completely comfortable dining here. We ordered off of the lunch menu and everything was delivered quickly. The food was excellent and well priced."}
{"text":"This place wasn't too bad, but compared to the Thai Taste in Dilworth, the Dilworth was way much better. I had a Pad See Ewe and it felt like they pre-made the food and just heated it up. My food was somewhat a little soggy. However, their Pud Asparagus was pretty good. I also had Thai tea, but was a little disappointed with how sweet it was."}
{"text":"Love this place.We recently discovered this place.The food comes out very quickly, but I always enjoy having some hot tea to relax.The meals arrive in a timely manner and were authentic with full flavor.You can't possibly have a bad time here."}
{"text":"Hands-down...the best Thai food in Charlotte!  We always go at lunch time and the place is always busy.  The service is always fast and friendly and the food is always hot and delicious.  They use excellent ingredients...lots of fresh veggies (including HOT peppers and Thai Basil), lean meats, and they buy their noodles fresh.  I highly recommend that unadvertised \"House Noodles with all 3 meats\".  Outstanding!"}
{"text":"We get takeout here pretty much once a week. Haven't had a dish we don't like and they're always so friendly. Our favorites are the Massaman curry, Pad Thai, and stir-fried cashew nut."}
{"text":"I am a huge fan of Thai Taste on East Boulevard, and so far as I can tell, this is owned/operated by the same folks. However, it is an entirely different experience, from the atmosphere to the food itself.

When you walk in, this is more like an upscale eatery (as far as atmosphere goes), which isn't necessarily bad - it's just different. When you ask for hot on East Boulevard, you can get something that is hot - when you ask for hot here, you get something middling. Perhaps they expect those of us in the suburbs don't know what we can handle or something, but it is an entirely different experience.

The flavors are also just not as good - though East Boulevard is a much longer trek, it's well worth it for me to head there instead of this middling experience."}
{"text":"I came here for lunch one and was surprised at how small the lunch menu was. There wasn't anything on there that I wanted to eat so I ended up getting the pad thai. I asked for extra spicy and when I received my dish, it was very sweet and not spicy at all. I had a hard time eating my food because there were so many peanuts on it. Not a huge fan."}
{"text":"I find myself in agreement with some of the other reviewers (some of whom I'm never in agreement with). I've been here several times for lunch and a couple times for dinner.

There are few options in Matthews-Mint Hill for Thai food, so Thai Taste Matthews serves to fill that void. A unique corner space in Matthews Station across from Town Hall, Thai taste is elegantly decorated and staffed by warm, welcoming employees.

For lunch, they are fantastic. A variety of menu items that arrive well executed. I find their lunch portions to be just the right size, too: not so small you find yourself snacking but not so egregiously large that you need a mid-afternoon nap. I'm not the biggest fan of heat, so you order your spice level using 1-5. Two is usually where I fall, especially if it's in a coconut sauce with a slight sweetness to cut the heat. Friends who are into hot and spicy are happy with a 3.

Dinner, on the other hand, has not been as kind to me. The prices are noticeably higher for many of the same dishes and the quality seems to lag. Maybe I've just been on bad nights, but it has happened more than once and worthy of noting.


For a quick Thai fix, especially when the mood strikes midday, Thai Taste will certainly fit the bill if you are in Matthews."}
{"text":"5 stars for thai taste. Being from DC were I am used to a lot of thai food being available and having options, charlotte is quite opposite. Thai taste is authentic and delicious. They let you choose your level of spicy which is awesome. Pad thai is delicious here. Staff is nice and always willing to chat."}
{"text":"I just moved to Charlotte from NY and I'm so happy this restaurant is near me. The Pad Thai is very tasty. I've had the pleasure of ordering take out from them twice and both times I've been satisfied. Hopefully more restaurants like this will open soon."}
{"text":"Food was good but, not great. Location is very cool, in the town center. (think Big White columned building with southern looking square)

No lunch specials-you paid dinner prices."}
{"text":"the food was pretty great. I ordered takeout and walked down the street to the carolina beer temple. Had a wonderful evening with Thai food and great beer. 

I would have given it 5 stars but felt the lady behind the counter was a bit rude. 

I would go back again."}
{"text":"I do not like this place.  The prices are very expensive and the quality of food is a disgrace.  Nothing tastes like it does at any Thai place I've been to.  I was so upset with the Pad Kee Mao.  Just awful!!!! The only reason for the two stars is the extremely overpriced but delicious mango sticky rice.  I just can't deal with this place otherwise."}
{"text":"We ordered the Shrimp Pad Thai, Summer Rolls, and Fried Tofu. The food was delicious and fresh. The service was friendly and accommodating."}
{"text":"Finally found myself in downtown Matthews for lunch and stopped in at Thai Taste. I knew it was there but just hadn't had the chance to try it yet. It was just after 1pm and the place was fairly busy but I was seated right away. Went with the chicken Pad Thai with a level 4 heat. The chicken was tender but the heat fell short on where I expected it to be. That's ok, the flavor & texture was spot on. The spring roll was crispy and hot. The staff was friendly and quick to refill my tea. Overall a really good experience. I look forward to going back."}
{"text":"Just. Plain. Awful. Went with a friend & ordered the summer rolls & Pad Thai. The rolls were very bland & the dipping sauces were strange (tasted old). When the Pad Thai came we immediately noticed the color was different from any we'd had elsewhere (red & powdery). Somehow we managed to choke down a couple bites before calling over the server to have her take it away! It tasted like spoiled spaghetti--very tomatoey...after taking our still full plates, another person came over (we assumed was the manager) & told us we'd still have to pay because \"everyone loves their Pad Thai & nothing was wrong with it\". After a few moments of going back & forth with her we finally got the bill adjusted (as she cursed us loudly from the register) and left as quickly as possible! Definitely won't be back!"}
{"text":"The food here is always spectacular and the service is always good. If you come a couple of times, the proprietor will remember you (and she does for us since we come every couple of weeks). I believe it's a sister location to the Thai House on East Blvd.

Get the number 4 as an appetizer. I rate Thai places based on how good their Pad Thai is and this is a good one."}
{"text":"Food was good, but smaller portions for the price, compared to other Thai restaurants in town. Service is good too."}
{"text":"I'm not a Thai fan - but business took me here. I can't really tell you what I had. It was number 36 on the menu. It was good. Everyone else really loved the food - like I said I'm just not a huge fan."}
{"text":"I got the drunken noodles and asked for skinny (Pad Thai )noodles and 4 star (out of five) spicy.
It exceeded my expectations. Perfect amount of heat and tasted great. I ordered summer rolls and didn't ask for shrimp or ask if there were any shrimp in it. I was disappointed there was not but my bad on a to go order.  I've had better but this was such an unexpected treat I have to give it five stars."}
{"text":"My husband and I found this place while looking for a restaurant to eat in Matthews . It was an after all pleasant experience . The food was good. We ordered the Tom yum soup which was a great choice .  For appetizer,    We had the Koong Gra Bok or Marinated shrimp in egg roll shells, deep fried and served with sweet and spicy sauce . It was also good but nothing exceptional . For entrees, we chose two items.  The Pud see Euh was my favorite ( Rice noodles ) prepared with a mix of vegetables . Our server was very helpful and helped us with our choices. We definitely will be back ."}
{"text":"A go to for our date night. Friendly family run service. Great food and selection. Pad Thai is on point. I tend to get the 2 star where my boyfriend gets the 3-4 depending on the night. Came out piping hot, seasoned perfectly. Also, never a long wait and dishes come flying out of the kitchen. They are a well oiled machine. Quality food. Quality price. Great when you are craving some good food.  

I wish they had at least one appealing dessert."}
{"text":"Practically born and raised in Thai restaurants because my family owns several in Chicago and Thailand  -- I hope that means something when I say I will never go back to this place. Worst Thai food ever. Sometimes when I walk into a place they immediately wonder if I am Thai and ask me if I want \"authentic Thai\".  Isn't that what I am here for?  Immediately I recognize that I might not have always have a good meal if I frequent the restaurant.  I walked in to Thai Taste and got several looks and stares but none of the owners or wait staff ever asked me.  I figure that this place has been around for years and it's busy so it must be decent, right?  

This place just serves whatever they throw on a plate and calls it Thai food, maybe that's why the restaurant is called \"Taste of Thai\" because it sure don't taste like it!  I would be much happier eating Chinese and I don't even like Chinese food.  Just because it's the first restaurant of its kind in the area, does not mean that it's the best or any good.  

So enough of my ranting.  Here's some useful information - our table had Satay, Mee Krob, Tod Mon Pla,  Panang, Pad Gra Pow, Pad Thai, and their \"specialty\" Thai Taste Fried Rice.  You know...basic Thai food that most Thais know how to cook. The equivalent difficulty in cooking a few of these dishes would be chicken wings, spaghetti, and beef stew.  I tasted everything (I chuckle now when I say \"taste\" simply because of the name of this restaurant) and did not enjoy a single thing. The meat was either dry or tough, the flavor was either lacking in one dish or foul in another.  It also seemed like the cook was trying to be \"creative\" but ended up tasting (haha, there's that word again) like a disaster.

This place is busy and I have heard good things about it from locals.  I have also heard that before this place opened, no one really has had Thai food before.  My experience with people and Asian food, actually food in general in NC, is that people don't know the difference or don't know any better. So readers....here is my recommendation - skip Thai Taste and go to Thai 1st Bistro @ Blakeney and get yourself some decent Thai food!  It's worth the drive.

A message to the Thai Taste owners: stick with simple basic Thai cooking.  Stay true to the flavors and ingredients of Thai food by keeping it authentic."}
{"text":"Always great food! Prices are very fair as well. The service is alway fast and courteous."}
{"text":"I don't know why I chose three stars...It just wasn't as bad as 2 stars but not as good as 4 stars.  

I just overall didn't really enjoy my experience here.  The service was ok, just not super friendly.  The food was decent but nothing special.  I tried the chicken pad thai and the flavoring was just odd.  It is almost as if they cooked some type of fishy fish in the same pan right before heating up my frozen meal.  It came out too quickly to be very fresh and I couldn't really taste anything but a fishy aftertaste and there wasn't any fish in my dish.  Bleh....The chicken was not tender either...it was chewy and I left most of it on my plate even though I really wanted the protein.  It just wasn't worth choking down the \"smicken\" or whatever type of alternate meat it was.

Won't be back.."}
{"text":"What a great place for Thai food. Very welcoming and food is always good. We eat there 2-3 times a month and have never been unhappy."}
{"text":"Somehow related to the Thai Taste on East Boulevard in South End, this location has a few differences in the way they approach the lunch specials. Instead of unsweetened tea and a pitcher and a squeeze bottle of sugar syrup, they simply have sweet tea. Fewer condiments on the table. And they take the check at the table instead of at the register.

But the differences don't end there. The lunch specials \"menu card\" is the same with the same prices, but I found the Pad Thai with Chicken a little hotter (two star fresh here is equivalent to three star fresh in South End) and it was mixed up differently. Slightly different flavor and texture. Not better, not worse. Just different."}
{"text":"I stopped in to grab a late lunch the Saturday before Easter.  Many places were closed and I was so thankful to find a Thai restaurant with an outside seating area.  It was a beautiful day and their were flowers decorating the outside area.  It was the perfect place to enjoy my food.  I ordered the Massaman curry and it was superb.  It was perfectly creamy and wasn't overly coconut-flavored.  The crunchy peanuts on top were the perfect complement to the generous portion of carrots and chicken in my dish.  It had a little bit of sweet, a hint of fruit, a tad bit of spicy, and a whole lot of flavor.  It's hard to describe it very well, but I think the word umami fits is perfectly.  It was so savory and delicious.  If there is any one small thing I was disappointed in, it'd be the level of spiciness.  I told my server I really like spice and asked for a little bit of heat, so he recommended a 3 out of 5 level of heat.  I barely got any heat in my 3, so I was a little let down there.  Next time I order there, (and I WILL definitely order there again), I will definitely try a 4!"}
{"text":"I will start by saying that Thai Taste is by far my favorite Thai restaurant.  That being said, I am not a Thai food expert by any means.  I frequently (once every 2 weeks at least) eat Thai food but I usually get the same few dishes.  I LOVE Pad Thai and Thai Taste has the best I have ever had.  I love the lunch special because for under $10 you get soup, one of the lunch specials (Pad Thai is always on the menu), and a spring roll.  

I have also tried the Pad See Ew, Spring Roll appetizer, and several different hot pots of soup.  I have never had a problem with the service here.  The food, drinks, refills, and check delivery have always been quick.  I will continue to frequent Thai Taste any time I visit my parents/friends in Charlotte."}
{"text":"Came here for dinner the other night after a failed attempt to try this place (they were closed for a week - probably summer vacation).  Did not notice the sign that read \"The oldest Thai restaurant in Charlotte\" until leaving, but that was a good indication of longevity and the quality of their food.  Now the Matthew's location is pretty new - the staff is super friendly and the dining room is ultra clean.

Our food came out rather fast after ordering (a good thing!).  I had the \"C-2\" curry with chicken and it was delicious.  The amount of rice served with the dish was perfect..... I always have trouble with my rice to mean/sauce ratio.  I got a \"3\" heat for the spiciness and by the end of the meal, my mouth was good and warm - just the right amount."}
{"text":"So good!  I haven't had Thai food since I moved to Charlotte from Chicago.  I regularly went to Thai Zie in St. Charles, and the family that runs it is from Thailand and completely spoiled me with their amazing dishes.  

I didn't think I was going to find anything nearly as good but I was wrong!  

I ordered the vegetarian pad see ewe, my husband got chicken curry, and we shared an appetizer.  My dish was amazing!  I don't know how they did it but we ordered takeout and served our food 20 minutes after we picked it up and it was somehow still steaming hot.  We will be back!"}
{"text":"I've been wanting to try this place out for a long time.  My husband and I had a date night, and decided to go try it.  It was fantastic. The waiter was super nice, and very helpful since we had never been there before.  The food was absolutely fantastic. Great taste, and a lot of food for the price. We will definitely be back, there were other things on the menu I want to try!!!"}
