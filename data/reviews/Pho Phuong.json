{"text":"Please do yourself a favor and do not go here, especially if you have kids.  The food is so-so at best and our server was not nice, not helpful and generally bad at her job.  The whole staff seemed indifferent and a little irritated, like they all desperately wished they were somewhere else.  This place is right around the corner from my house and my husband and I love pho but we will never go back, especially when the Golden Turtle on Ossington is near by.  The food and service are much better and they are welcoming to children."}
{"text":"I've been going to this place since it opened and it is fantastic. Very clean, fresh food ( delicious as well). Great service. Good for group events and parties. Family friendly as well. It's a very fantastic Vietnamese Restaurant. Love the Pho dishes, the appetizers, and rice an meat dishes. They have very yummy fried Vietnamese spring rolls. Give this place a try won't get disappointed."}
{"text":"Fast, tasty, I like the new seats to look out the window and munch on some bun watching Queen West go by. If you want NO SPROUTS you must ask very clearly. If Golden turle was closer it'd be my go-to but this is nearer and not half bad."}
{"text":"Picked up lunch on Sunday and ordered seafood pho (13.00) , shrimp fresh rolls (4.00), and an avocado shake (5.00). The broth seemed pretty plain tasting for the darker color it presented with, which was surprising. The fresh rolls were good. Avocado shake was delicious because it was made with real. Fresh avocados vs a powder. Their credit card machine was down so they just took our credit card number to manually enter it. I'd much prefer that, than a cash only place like Pho Nho. I feel like i would enjoy the other dishes there because their menu is so huge! I will be returning to the restaurant to try their other dishes, like their bun (vermicelli) and their rice plates.  The prices are a little on the higher side as well for a Vietnamese restaurant, however it's ambience is much nicer and cleaner than some of the others out there as well. It's worth a try."}
{"text":"Delicious food, and genuinely nice service. The decor in the place needs some work. Perhaps some nicer artwork, and most certainly more TVs. Having said that Vietnamese is usually a quick meal anyways. V6 is by far my favorite dish for two reasons: 1) have a V6 in my car, and 2) it has every meat in it. Also, if you have a hang over try a Bun dish... It soaks it all up...just saying."}
{"text":"Love Vietnamese food, hated the ghetto restaurants that served it. Pho Phuong is where I found great authentic food with out the ghetto. I loved that my ass didn't itch from the dirty fabric chairs after. The Pho and Spring Rolls are my favourite."}
{"text":"In a city littered with Pho restaurants in every corner, Pho Huong in Dundas West stands out for its authentic Vietnamese menu, fresh ingredients and contemporary decor.  The price is very competitive and the dining experience is cozy and comfortable.  The only downside is the service, which is friendly but inattentive.  No other amenities or interests around the area of the restaurant, so it's definitely a dine and dash place."}
{"text":"I live just around the corner from this place and I'm sorry that I didn't try it sooner! It is very clean, and really reasonably priced as long as you stay away from the \"specials\" which seem generally higher in $$.  I have been searching for a good vermicelli with lemon grass and beef (#88) since moving here two years ago and they absolutely nailed it!  As for the service, they're very quiet, but efficient and attentive. I don't think the problem is that they have a bad attitude, but that they lack strong enough English to chat it up with the customers. Fair enough, they have you write down the numbers of your order and nothing gets lost in the translation.  Going back tonight!"}
{"text":"The food was okay - just okay. I had to ask several times for water or additional things, service was disorganized and ignored you.  The food comes in sizes, be prepared for the XL, lots of food.  Spring rolls were okay, I was expecting better as it was hyped up.  The beef is over cooked - had to ask to cook less.  Overall, the experience was average, the food was lesser than expected, and the service failed."}
{"text":"After reading all the reviews here I thought this place would be a pretty safe bet. I was ultra-disappointed. Here are ways that Pho Phuong did not live up to my expectations of what a basic pho restaurant should provide.  I ordered the pho with veg broth. It tasted like water. I wasn't brought basil or bean sprouts, I don't think they do that here.   The tea was cold right out of the pot.   The loud crappy music was bad enough but then the cd started skipping. I think at least five CDs skipped while I was there.   They didn't have rooster hot sauce but instead some less flavorful substitute.  The restaurant is big and clean-looking, unfortunately that doesn't make up for this bad experience. Next time i'll go back to Golden Turtle. (http://www.yelp.ca/biz/rua-vang-golden-turtle-toronto)"}
{"text":"I like the pho here, so I have kept coming back although the service really needs some work. Some of the staff is friendly and attentive, while others are rude, dismissive, and don't actually listen to what you are ordering. Usually you have to chase down your server even when it's not very busy. They have also messed up my take-out order on more than one occasion, and were not at all accommodating when I called back to complain. This is especially frustrating because when you call to order they hang up really fast without confirming anything. Also their portion sizes are very inconsistent, as are the ingredients with take out orders. I have been here many times because it's convenient and the food is pretty good, but I'm looking for a new pho place because I'm tired of all the mistakes."}
{"text":"I've eaten at this somewhat stylish pho place a few times and can't really complain.  The prices are a dollar or two more than the 'grungy' pho joints and the service is pretty much mediocre. I don't really expect much more.  I usually order the spicy veg pad thai. Makes for a great lunch the next day...The bun dishes is also good and so is the bubble tea, hot Taro is my fav.   It does close slightly early and had to find another pho place one night around 10 p.m. as the lights were already out when I drove by..."}
{"text":"Abandon all hope ye who enter here.  Delicious food just completely offset by the horrendous service.  Take out is not any better, as they will manage to screw up your order somehow.  You could easily sit here for 30 minutes without being acknowledged.  Soup comes without any bowls.  Entree comes without plates and we asked for a dish with veggies and shrimp and what we got was a side plate of completely raw, only steamed vegetables and had to ask them to please cook and combine the vegetables with our entree which was as it was described to us.  It's really too bad that the front of house is completely ruining such tasty food.  It's worth eating here, but just barely."}
{"text":"I've eaten here only once, on a terribly hungover day when I could not bear to walk any farther away from home.  It was good. It's clean and slick looking, with dark tables and nice lighting, so that stands out as different from your average pho joint. The pho was good enough. I recall it as being on the high end of pho prices, so still pretty inexpensive.   The service was definitely lacking - inattentive that may have moved right into neglectful, which is sort of amazing considering how little I require from pho service. I was there mid afternoon, so perhaps they were just doing other things. That doesn't excuse neglectful service, but it might explain it."}
{"text":"Pho Phuong has just opened a new location on Queen Street. It has the same slick appearance as the one on Dundas, in a slightly smaller location. It feels clean and bright and has lots of natural light. When I visited, there were 6 or 8 irises lining a small piece of wall, as well as a banner out front and balloons at the bar. Opening celebration!  I went in for late afternoon pho two days ago and had a small bowl of rare beef pho (I rarely deviate from this). It was good. Not amazing. But good.  Which is a shame because, though the small is large enough to be a meal, it was $6.75 and pho would have to be pretty amazing for me to feel that was justified. Certainly you're paying here for the decor that far outclasses other pho joints in the area, but it turns out that I don't really need class with my pho.   We also ate deep fried shrimp wrapped around sugar cane ($5), just to try something different. It was good. Not particularly flavourful, and could have benefited from an accompanying sauce, but it was fun to eat the soft shrimp and then gnaw and suck the juice out of the sugar cane.  I was also tempted by the hot and sour soup listed on the House Special menu but at $12 for a bowl (10$ for the veggie version) just couldn't wrap my head around a $12 bowl of soup."}
{"text":"Great fast service. Very clean and welcoming. Food is always tasty. Best rolls in the area."}
{"text":"Pho Phuong is my \"go to\" place when a craving hits and I've ventured outside of Chinatown.  It's a little bit more expensive relative to the my spots in north Toronto but I don't mind paying a bit more for clean, stick-free and stink-free tables.  Their pho soup is pretty consistent and very flavourful.  All-in-all love this place!"}
{"text":"disappointing for the third time by Kris (1 review) This restaurant has potential. Great location and nicely decorated. I live in the neighbourhood and thought that I would give it another chance, hoping that the quality of food had improved from my previous visits over the past few years. Well, it hasn't. . Portions are small and food is tasteless. I ordered the vegetable and squid dish and a side order of rice noodles. When I asked for hot sauce, it appeared that I was asking too much from the waitstaff. I decided not to ask for water. I eat Vietnamese food on a regular basis but will not return."}
{"text":"I found the mango shake with the sex-toy straw!  It's in my album.  I forget how to rotate my pics.  Someone remind me .... ?"}
{"text":"Dinner visit with friends after basketball. Upscale Vietnamese restaurant targeted at the Western market. Staff are Vietnamese so that's a good start. Ordered Pho and Rice rolls. Both were good and same applies to the service. Prices slightly higher than the usual venues but not complaining since the establishment is much nicer. Overall, I would revisit and recommend others to give them a try"}
{"text":"I'm not a big Pho person, but I love the vermicelli noodle bowls here! I honestly can't find a better place for them here in Edmonton. The Pad Thai is really good too. Their the complementary jasmine tea is very nice and they keep it coming your whole meal! Prices are really great too, most are under $10, and really generous portions. Great service and great food! I Love coming here when I'm in Toronto."}
{"text":"The veggie pho is very bland - you need to add a lot of sauce - they must use water instead of a Veggie Broth. Spring Rolls are pretty good.  Atmosphere is nice - pretty docor and large space. Service is mediochre.  I would recommend going to Pho Nho which is just up the street, instead."}
{"text":"I cannot believe how things have changed in 3 years. I picked up duck congee sometime in the winter when my hubby was sick.  I was very disappointed because the ginger fish sauce tasted like it had gone bad (it should never be bitter).  Today, my hubby wanted to eat there since he was craving the duck congee and most places don't serve the duck & coleslaw side. We waited about 10 minutes to get our menu.  After we placed our orders, we waited another 5 minutes to get the tea that most places bring with the menu.  I could go on with the details but the gist of the story is they were understaffed or the staff was slow.  The worst part of it was that the service.  The servers make us feel bad for asking for anything (like when they took our order).  We had arrived and placed our order before another couple bside us at least 10 minutes ahead but somehow, this couple received their pho before mine.  They were almost done eating their pho before mine came out."}
{"text":"I really love the food here. It's worth the few extra dollars compared to some other places. Everything is fresh and delicious. Everything is clean. The staff is definitely just as disinterested as at the original Dundas location, but it's not a problem if you're prepared to not be doted on.   Veggie spring rolls - not too oily and great sauce, veggie fresh rolls - super fresh with warm tofu and crispy cold lettuce, veggie pad thai - the awesome kind of peanut and chilli pad thai not the ketchupy stuff. The tofu is firm and cooked well, never mushy blah."}
{"text":"*4 star for food* *2 star for service*  I was in the area to see a show at Lula Lounge and checked restaurants (on Yelp yeah!) around the venue. Surprisingly, a lot of restaurants that popped up were Vietnamese and I still had a Pho craving that was not satisfied (obviously) from Spring Rolls.   This resto is so close by (15 second walk) from Lula Lounge that it was a no brainer. The exterior looked clean and I could see that the interior was modern and spacious.   The menu is very extensive!!!!!!!!!! and I could tell this place was authentic. How? All the Vietnamese patrons that were dining there:D My bf and I decided upon two small Pho's, a Mango Salad with Chicken and my fave, Cold Spring rolls with Chicken. All I can say is YUMMMMMMMMMMMM! The rolls were so fresh that they were still warm. I could have ordered 4 more plates of those (each plate has two rolls). Then the Mango Salad was so refreshing and the hint of Mint just rounded the dish. They sure know how to pair taste combinations. Now, I don't know my Pho's, but the ones here were great in my mind. I had the Beef Ball and I slurped mine in no time.  Total damage for two people? $34. I just wish that this restaurant was located closer to me I have never been near the Dufferin and Dundas Street West area (very sketch IMHO) so it was great to see an eclectic group of resto's popping up. Just down, down, the corner I saw Hogtown Café so really, lots of different cuisines to try.  Service was very indifferent. I wish it was better because the food was just so amazing. We had to ask for everything. No plates were given. No cutlery. Everything came out all at once. We had to give our order (piece of paper and you mark your items down) up front at the register. The only good thing? They bring your yummy food so quickly. If I am ever in the area, I am so coming back here!"}
{"text":"I usually come here a couple times a month for my pho fix. Although there are 2 similar restaurant on Ossington very close to my house I choose to drive here. Food is very good and the place is so clean. Service is sometimes hit & miss though. They use very little or no MSG. We had the #28 & # 29 with amazing spring rolls & rice rolls filled with pork & shrimp. Pho could use a bit more beef, but still good value."}
{"text":"Let me not mince words: Pho Phuong is fantastic.  Food is fresh and yummy.  Service is quick.  Space is open and clean.    Ok, it IS a little off the beaten path, but it is always a must go for me when a trip to Dufferin Mall is planned.  I have been going back for years, even after having moved out of the neighbourhood over 6 years ago and living much much closer to all the other pho places lining Spadina.  As with most Vietnamese places, the menu is extensive with a lot of choices and variations.  But I have settled on two dishes I haven't wavered from in years: the shrimp and pork salad rolls (approx. $5) and the bbq pork vermicelli (approx. $7).  I've been to many Vietnamese places in the city, but I don't think I have had a better salad roll anywhere else.  The bbq pork is seasoned just right and is not in chop form... in other words, no need for a knife and cutting around the bone!  Whenever anyone asks me to recommend a pho place, Pho Phuong and Mimi (Gerard St.) are the two I always mention.  The epitome of cheap and cheerful!  But also very delicious."}
{"text":"I'd never had Vietnamese food before, but the party I was with swore by this place, so we stopped in.  I didn't bring my camera, (shame on me), but the food would have been fantastic to photograph.    It's been at least a month since I was here, so bare with my strained review.  We stopped in on either a Friday or Saturday, and everywhere else was packed, except this place.  This of course had me slightly worried, until I realized every other place we passed was a pub.    I dined with a party of seven, myself included, and so there was plenty of food sampling and trading going on, but through most of the meal people were silent.  (Always a good sign!)  The prices were reasonable, they had several vegetarian selections, and the staff was more than willing to be accommodating on several items swaps and replacements.  Oh, and the bubble tea was quite nice.  All in all, I'd say this place was pretty good.  It didn't blow me out of the water or anything, but it's definitely worth a try if you like Vietnamese."}
{"text":"I wish zero stars was an option. This place was brutal. We never got asked if we wanted drinks, which we never ended up getting. The servers didn't even give us a chance to ask about certain items on the menu. They just walked by and grabbed our ticket and took off. They brought out 3 plates and waited 10 mins to bring out our fourth (we were a table of four). They messed up my order and whatever it was that they gave me had zero taste and had the worst cuts of meat in it that I've ever seen. When we were done eating they didn't clear our plates and waited 30 mins for our bill before my father said fuck it and had to go up to the counter to pay.   I'm blown away that people have given this place decent reviews. A nice outer store front does not make for a good restaurant. Don't waste your time or your money. I could have gotten better food and service at the hockey rink down the road."}
{"text":"One of the best Vietnamese places I`ve tried in Toronto. Very fresh and very filling. I love Vietnamese coffee and this serves one of the best."}
{"text":"I like this place. probably my fav vietnamese restaurant in the city because it isn't intimidatingly hole in the wall.  AND the food is delicious. I'm a big fan of their broken rice dishes, pho and the savory pancake. OH and the fresh rolls are AWESOME here!"}
{"text":"I get it. The food is yummy but nothing extraordinary. The service is pleasant but not very engaged or energetic. The ambiance is okay - would be a standout in China Town  - but a little downscale for fancy new queen west. So you go in and you have an okay time, but you're left with a feeling of \"Meh\".  Despite that, I would gladly return to dine in or take out. They may be too slow for you to bring hungry kids, but they were exceedingly patient with the ill-behaved adult who was throwing a hissyfit with her boyfriend when we were there. And if you're looking for a place on queen west where you can have a good meal at a reasonable price without feeling like you have to channel your inner poseur, then you will like it here."}
{"text":"Table was sticky when we sat down. Had to ask server for a rag to clean it. Pho came without any basil, lime or bean sprouts and the sausages on the vermicelli were almost rancid. tHere were no hot sauces, or hoisin on the table as you normally find at a place that serves Pho.  When I asked the server for some fish sauce, she pointed to the used dips that she had left behind after clearing our spring rolls and said \"There's Fish Sauce in that, isn't there?\".  Absolutely terrible and ignorant service and awful food. Will never return and will tell others to avoid this place."}
{"text":"GOOD TIP: If you're eating alone, ask for tea. They never bring it when I'm eating alone even though I've been there so many times. It's still free either way. ;)  This is more of a 3 and a half, but I couldn't quite give them a 4. I go here about 2-3 times a month because it's so close. The customer service is not bad but not good, simply bland. But, the food is solid for the price point. The Spring Rolls are amazing, the Vermicelli Bowl is yummy, and the Pho is good most of the time (with the exception of one time where I got all marrow meat chicken). If you wants a good meal for $10 or under, this is a great place!"}
{"text":"This is a nicer upscale looking vietnamese restaurant. The food here is very average, but the service here is hit or miss."}
{"text":"We were excited to have pho on New Years day, and as you have it: the neighbourhood favourite, Pho Lihn was closed for the holidays. So we found ourselves in this big spacious Pho Phuong.   The service was lack luster, slow, and inattentive. When asked for red pepper, we had to ask twice, and why did we have to ask anyway? Most other places bring it with the beansprout and basil. They only gave us one, and since we were a group of five, we had to share a tiny single pepper.   They continue to show their stinginess: The few pieces of pork that I had on my vermicelli,  were over fried till it is covered in black burn mark. Yes, the exact black mark that I was taught to stay away from growing up.  My vermicille tasted okay, nothing to write home about, and the pho was reportedly passable. But did I mention it was more expensive than the (way tastier) pho nearby (Pho Lihn, Turtle, etc)?   It was not the first meal I'd wish to eat for the start of a new year, but it can only get better, right?"}
{"text":"I go strictly for the pho and the spring rolls.  Its delish and great location."}
{"text":"Anyone who gives this place less than a 5 stars is crazy. I've been trying to find a great pho place for 3 years in Toronto and  so happily I finally found this place. We had the rare beef soups (very generous with meat, it's super lean and thinly sliced which I love), the pork and shrimp spring rolls ( so much fried deliciousness), and a fantastic mango salad, peanuts, onions, perfect amount of dressing. We got take out and the restaurant looked super clean and the staff was extremely friendly, smiling, thanking me for coming. This will certainly be the new go-to."}
{"text":"They had a bunch of bubble teas to pick from. Very yummy. We vermicelli noodle bowls that were delicious. The service was great and it's a nice setting too"}
{"text":"Pho Phuong has a nice ambiance (a little more upscale than most pho places), good service and some great dishes.  Pho Phuong has the best Banh Xeo in the city!  Went on a Friday night and the place was packed and the service was still quite excellent.  The pho is very good (above average) and the menu is quite extensive."}
{"text":"This place is spacious with modern decor. That's about all positive about this place. The pho is so bland and possibly the worse pho i have ever had. Service is slow, and wait for food is long even though the store is empty. Everything we asked from the waiter takes forever to get for us. Price are higher than other pho places. Not recommended."}
{"text":"Good! Service needs work, a little disorganized,they mix up orders and tables."}
{"text":"Pho was ok, better still was the view of the bar I would be drinking at in an hours time.  Famous for birthing the motto: \"Service with a vacant, ambivilant look.\"."}
{"text":"Great new place, just opened.  Walked in, nice clean and fast.  Food was excellent, will be back and back and back."}
{"text":"Went here just hours ago. Last customers to eat, got in at 10:30 pm. They were just about to close up shop but the Manager was nice enough to let us stay and eat. Expecting that it wouldn't be their best work since they would be rushing to serve us so we get out of there faster. To my surprise., Turned out to be one of the better tasting Pho that I've had. Savoury, flavourful and generous with the Veggies and Beef. I ordered a Small Pho #28 and Spring Rolls. Absolute delish! Being from a family that has some Viet heritage and familiar with the cuisine and even done some travelling there myself. They do a really good noodle soup and doesn't leave me with the feeling that they over did it with the msg. Definitely will be coming back when I strike up the craving for Pho."}
{"text":"I tried the Beef Sate & Spring Rolls Vermicelli. The dish was freshly prepared. The Beef Sate was ok, it could have used more of the sate sauce that they used to marinate the beef but the sate flavour was not one that I truly cared for. It tasted like sate sauce from a store bought jar of sate sauce that I've had before and was not overly impressed with. The spring rolls weren't too bad. I think this place serves decent Vietnamese food but I wouldn't rate it among my favourites. The Nc chm which is crucial to all Bún dishes was too sweet. The ingredients are fresh but the flavours need work."}
{"text":"First, let me say that I would rate Pho Phuong a \"just there\" 4.  There's a lot it does well, but nothing truly exceptional.  Nothing blows me away, but I've never once been disappointed.  It's an excellent go-to pho joint, and since it's close to our home we go there a lot.  My favourite dish is the simple chicken pho, which comes with very nicely pre-roasted chicken (rather than the boiled stuff you find at most pho joints).  This adds a depth of flavour that really lifts this staple up.  Definitely a **** rating for what would almost always be a *** or less at other, lesser, restaurants.  We're always brought generous amounts of fresh basil, sprouts, and citrus (usually lime, though on a couple occasions it's been lemon... probably due to lime suckage at the time).  Whenever I've ventured away from their many phos, I've been happy but not thrilled.  Their dishes tend to be pretty run of the mill, albeit done very well.  I don't think you can go wrong, but you won't necessarily have your socks knocked off by anything on the menu.  Again, however, since this is just a straightforward pho joint, that isn't a bad thing.  Outside of the food, the decor is very nice (if a bit pre-fab, what with the fake orchids and other fake greenery), and I could definitely do without the televisions constantly playing the news.  Service is pleasant albeit a tad slow from time to time.  All in all, quite happy with Pho Phuong.  It's not Hamilton's B&T, but I've yet to find a place that comes close to rivaling that mecca of Viet/Thai food in Toronto, let alone the rest of Ontario!"}
{"text":"This has become my go to for Vietnamese cuisine as I find the food here to be great.  I had the vermicelli with grilled pork/chicken, spring roll and shrimp on sugar cane along with the red, white & mung bean with coconut milk on shaved ice.  The portions were decent (like other restaurants there is a fair bit of filler vegetables) and the taste was great. The spring roll was crispy, the grilled pork/chicken was pretty juicy and my favourite is the shrimp on sugar cane yum. The fish sauce here is very flavourful unlike some places I've been which tasted like water.  The drink I had was pretty good. I've definitely had better elsewhere but it does the job.  Service is pretty average here. They take your order, bring your food and take your money. Really nothing to write home about.  If you're in the area and had a craving for Vietnamese cuisine this place to me is the best option."}
{"text":"Pretty good, food,, about the same as other vietnamese food I've had before. The place its self is really nice. Stands out in a pretty old and gritty neighborhood. Got a bowl with spring rolls with chicken and beef. By the end i was full and just for $10."}
{"text":"I can't speak to the food as I didn't order any, but the Bubble Tea was terrible. The flavouring was weak, but the worst thing was the tapioca pearls seems \"crusty\" like they had dried out on a counter or something. It was quite gross and I couldn't even finish my beverage. I won't be returning."}
{"text":"Very nice inside , clean and fresh look  Food is good and fresh . Was here for lunch and wasn't busy during the week . I'd come back again"}
{"text":"This place is just ok. Nice atmosphere, big open and bright.   Spring  rolls were delicious!    Service was pretty awful. Not rude just very blase. Had to stand around the counter to order a drink, and had to get up again and go to the counter and ask for the bill (although, I'm not sure. Maybe you pay at the counter)   Pho was ok. Nothing to rave about, but hit the spot. I've also had the lemongrass shrimp bun in the past and it was super tasty."}
{"text":"FOOD I recommend ordering one of their broken rice dishes, if you don't already know what you want. Not all Vietnamese places serve broken rice, so this place holds a special spot for me! Broken rice is simply broken jasmine rice. Rather than be long grains of rice, they are half or 1/3 size of a regular grain. This makes for wonderful texture!! I can't get enough.   My friend always orders the lemongrass chicken on rice ($8.50). While there isn't actually very much lemongrass flavour, the dish is aromatic and makes you want to eat bowls and bowls of rice!   I really enjoy their Hainan chicken rice (full grain, not broken). It's a special, so I am not sure how long they will have it for. The rice is cooked with a green onion and ginger-infused oil, which makes the rice so tasty. The chicken is tender and flavourful.   SERVICE Very friendly, in the best way possible. I really appreciate the service here.  PRICES This place is a little pricier than other Vietnamese joints in the city. But for the quality of the food I am getting, I am willing to pay an extra $0.50 to $1.00  ATMOSPHERE It can get chilly in this restaurant! They crank up the A/C! So if you are one to get cold, bring something to cover up!  The restaurant feels clean, which is always nice."}
{"text":"Wow, this place is amazing! I really recommend it if you want authentic Vietnamese food. Everything was quick, easy and super clean. The Thai Peanut Satay soup was incredible, never had anything like it at any other Vietnamese restaurants in Calgary. The bubble tea was also very good, they had a wide variety of flavours. Also, the Deep Fried Banana's for dessert was amazing!!! Definitely coming back again and again and again!"}
{"text":"Great place for pho, the place is very well decorated. It'll make you feel right at home, anytime of the day.   The place can be super busy and noisy at times, but the food totally makes up for that, gets you in the zone how good the food can be here.   The restaurant has some great foods that are pretty exclusive such as banh xeo, and Tom muc Chien. If you're in the area it's a must try!"}
{"text":"I've walked by this place so many times over the past few years and yet I've only just now stopped in for a meal. It's tasty stuff, so I'm not sure why I waited so long.  Pho Phuong's menu boasts an intimidating amount of choices, but for our appetizer we opted for the Bo Bia (fresh cold rice paper rolls with Vietnamese sausage, jicama, dried shrimp, and fried egg). I've had a lot of similar rolls in my life but this was definitely one of the most stuffed I've ever sampled. The whole thing was definitely above average, although I'll be honest and admit the sausage didn't do much for me (and even seemed out of place). The dipping sauce was top-notch, too.  For my main, I opted for the Bun 4 Mau (House special vermicelli with beef roll wrapped with tropical leaves, BBQ beef roll, spicy satay beef roll, and shrimp wrapped on sugar cane). This was definitely one of the better variations on Bun I've had as of late, and the various meats included were all quite tasty. I especially dug the beef roll wrapped with tropical leaves, as it was certainly different from anything I've eaten before. My one complaint with this dish was that the portion was pretty small. It seemed like I had finished eating just as my dining companion was getting started on her dish."}
{"text":"Excellent pho. Spring rolls are great too. And the soups."}
{"text":"Pho Phuong is my go-to place whenever I'm under the weather.  What chicken noodle is to some, pho is my cure to any cold/flu virus bug I have. There must be something in the broth that just beats whatever virus festering in my body to a pulp because I always seem to recover after having a bowl of pho.   I've never actually eaten inside the restaurant; I usually grab my order and go home. But the decor is quite nice and modern, and it looks very clean.  While I'm all for trying new things, I don't stray from my regular order: number 32. The dish is noodles with rare beef strips and beef tendons. Keep in mind that there's another \"32\" dish that includes tripe. Make sure to indicate which one you want.  The food is good, for the lack of a better word. The broth is good, but I wouldn't say that it's as flavourful as the other pho places in the city.   The main reason that I keep coming here is because it's close to home. I do have other pho favourites in the city, but I want something that serves up decent good food, for a reasonable price then Pho Phuong doesn't disappoint."}
{"text":"Had a great dinner with a Toronto Chum this week!  Decoration in this place is clean with nice decor!  Now to the food.  We ordered a fresh spring roll and deep fried Spring roll.  Both were nice and had good flavour and texture!  Now to the main dish.  I ordered a vermicelli with chicken and pork.  It was a bit on the smaller side but that's okay as I don't want to get fat after all that holiday food!  Definitely a nice experience and great food!"}
{"text":"Pho Phuong has been on our regular list for a couple of years and in the last 6 months or so the food has been very up and down; at its best, it's excellent - one of my favorite vietnamese restaurants. At its worst it's mediocre. I'd love to give it 5 stars for the days that it's on for me but it's too inconsistent. I would describe the service as authentic - meaning it's up to you to get their attention at which point they are thorough, but don't expect them to actually wait on you. favorite dishes are the beef salad with mint, the beef rolls wrapped in \"exotic leaf\", the ribs braised in coconut juice, and the broken rice. Last word - beware the satay soup on the specials menu. The last time I ordered it, it was the hottest thing I've ever eaten - and  I like hot food.  We still go back, but a little less eagerly than we used to..."}
{"text":"Food was really good and the restaurant itself is really clean and bright.   Food came quickly, but servers seemed indifferent. When I went to pay, the staff continued a conversation with each other and didn't make eye contact with me.or even look in my direction. It was almost surreal."}
{"text":"Pho was excellent! Service was TERRIBLE!!!! Waiters looked unprofessional and uninterested in their customers.  Never greeted upon arrival and no one ever checked in once my food arrived. Never got asked if I wanted a drink?! I had to literally demand every service as they never initiated. With the many pho restaurants out there I will take my $$$$ elsewhere! Thank you, your loss!"}
{"text":"I have been going there for years, and they recently change ownership, I don't really write reviews because I always believe business owners have a tough time with online reviews, and this could hurt their business, but I just can't hold back on this one! Not only we found hairs (plural!!!) I drove back to return it, and the owner insisted its not my order and it was someone elses! I'm speechless and truly disappointed. Would absolutely not recommend to anyone"}
{"text":"WE just moved into the neighbourhood from Chinatown, and I was excited to see that these guys have lots of authentic vietnamese dishes on their menu.  We ordered from Just Eat and specified a delivery time of 8.30. This is where it started to go wrong - the food turned up at 8.10, so I had to leave my small kid who i was in the process of putting to sleep, to answer the door. Not a massive deal, but very annoying, and very indicative of the lack of attention to detail.   So on that whole attention to detail thing. When you order online (via just eat), they let you specify that you want lemongrass and/or sate (spicy oil) with your soup. i asked for both. When it came, neither of those things were present. i also asked (in my comments on the order) for meat and noodles to be packed separately, and they werent. i also asked for extra herbs (mint, basil) and there was nothing but a tiny handful of basil.  So here is the deal with this place: the food is fine, if you are not fussy. The broth is good, the noodles are not overcooked, they check all the basic boxes. But do not expect them to listen to you. They are a takeout machine, they do not care about individual customer preference. It's also not that cheap compared to other places that do a big bowl of pho for 7or 8 dollars, so weigh your options carefully. Next time I need pho delivered, I will buy from a place that pays attention to its customers and fulfils each order as requested."}
{"text":"I have been to three Pho restaurants in the neighbourhood (One on Ossington, the other on College) and now Pho Phuong. Although the portion for a large was a tiny bit smaller the quality of the food was very much worth it.  I order the beef and chicken pho (Number 49 on the menu) and I enjoyed it very much.  I ordered take-out, however while paying and waiting for my food to be ready I did notice that the restaurant itself is very clean and easy on the eyes.   I will definitely be going back I am also very happy it is down the street from my house!"}
{"text":"Worst bun dishes I've ever had.  I work in the strip mall so I've eaten here a few times out of convenience but it's the worst Vietnamese place I've eaten at in the city.  The dishes are completely inauthentic, taste worse than mall chinese and cost more, too.  The meat in the bun dishes tastes like it's drenched in western bbq sauce and spiced with black pepper.  The noodles are dry, stuck together, and broken up.  They can't even make a shrimp salad roll that doesn't fall apart as you try to pick it up.  The soups are lacking flavour and they cheap out on the meat compared to other places.  Go somewhere else, like Sunshine Restaurant on Canyon Meadows Drive, because this place should hire proper kitchen staff that know what they're doing."}
{"text":"Very average Vietnamese place.   Slightly higher pricing than most places but the service and decor make the extra $1-$2 justifiable. Clean, modern decor and friendly waitress!  Food is presented nicely. They have a typical Vietnamese menu - lengthy and slightly overwhelming with choices.   I had a bun (vermicelli) dish topped with a few different beef rolls. The rolls were quite bland but they were cooked well and not greasy. My friend tried the hot & sour soup which was also not bad.  Decent choice if you're hungry and in the neighbourhood, but not worth going out of your way for."}
{"text":"Great spot for delicious food at affordable prices. Our group of 8 had a variety of pho, noodles and rice dishes. All perfection. Mango salad a refreshing starter or side to eat alone or share. The only downside is the slow service. Our 2 coffees took almost 15 minutes for the first and another 10 minutes for the second. With that delay aside I would come back to try more of the very varied menu."}
{"text":"This is my go-to spot! I always try something new and it's always good. The restaurant is modern inside and have lots of space for large groups. I also get takeout and it's always good."}
{"text":"I don't know why I ended up at Pho Phuong!!! Yes my Yelp app did send me here... having Vietnamese was the last thing on my mind when I venture into this part of town...  But Tuesdays seems to be one of those days that a lot of places in the area day of rest. I was thinking I going to hit Yours Truly... but no it is not open.. How about Brockton General? no! Next... then I walked further west.. on Dundas.. on this cold winter evening...until I saw Pho Phuong.  On a cold day, a Pho is always good... and affordable? The Pho is OK here... but I was hungry and cold......  Service is as cold... but I got my food, I got my bill... and they seated me at a table with the full view of CP24.... my chopsticks are not sticky....   I said Thank You when they served me my food and gave me the bill and the staffs nodded their heads...  at least they did not ignore me."}
{"text":"If you want to go for Pho, but you're craving something classier than dingy Spadina, then Pho Phuong will do it for you. It's far down on Dundas, a couple blocks past Dufferin, and it offers something....nicer than the typical Pho joint.  Despite its location, Pho Phuong is actually gorgeous inside -- they have a really clean, modern decor and cute cutlery and dishes. Sleek white benches line the side of the restaurant, with tables that accomodate large groups and couples alike.  As for the food...it's decent. It's definitely not the best Pho in the city (Pho Tien Thanh! Ossington!) but they make a decent broth. It's a little too sweet for me, especially in their vegetarian broth, but it's still Pho and I love Pho so I can't really complain.  Service is super slow so I'd recommend just going up to the cash when you're ready to pay, or else you'll be waiting for years."}
{"text":"First time here and won't be going back; we only came here because Pho Linh (our go-to) on College street had a lineup.  We ordered a rice dish and a bowl of pho. The rice dish was delicious but considering how expensive it was it is a very small portion. The pho broth was bland and they cheaped out on the bean sprouts and basil for the pho.  I usually have a rule when it comes to dining in any Asian restaurant; if the patrons are majority non-Asians I don't eat there.  I have nothing against non-Asians but when the majority of your customers are not Asian it usually means the restaurant is cutting corners somewhere in terms of quality; unfortunately Pho Phuong couldn't prove me wrong.  I've read some other comments regarding this restaurant and it seems others have had the same experience."}
{"text":"I've seen mixed reviews for Pho Phuong, many about the service. When I go for Pho, I'm usually prepared for service ranging from over enthusiastic to just sheer apathy so I try not to get too bothered about such things. In any case, I was more laser focused on judging the quality of their food.   In short, even though this is a bit far from my pad, I will make the drive as this is my new go to place. For starters my friend and I shared some fresh rolls with shrimp as well as the fresh rolls with grilled pork. Then I had the vermicelli with a mix of different beef rolls. The one roll in particular that really sealed the deal for me was the beef wrapped in a green leaf - it was totally succulent and tasty! In fact I'm getting hungry just thinking about it right now....  Give this place a try. You won't regret it and if you do, I will buy your next Pho :)"}
{"text":"Was our first time here. We weren't quite sure what to expect considering the place was completely empty at 6pm on a Saturday night ( usually a red flag for me ). The place wasn't \"super\" Clean and for some reason kind of smelled like skunk (not weed) skunk but it wasn't dirty either. Girlfriend and I both ordered Sate pho. I've got to admit it's very authentic and tasty and large portion sizes. I'm a 28 year old 200lb athlete and I went hungry and couldn't finish the damn bowl. I'll definitely be back, wayyy better than bolsa ( no offence bolsa )."}
