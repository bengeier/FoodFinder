{"text":"I was looking for Lechon for my Mom's 60th Bday and BlogTO just posted Places to get Lechon in Toronto. http://www.blogto.com/eat_drink/2012/03/9_places_to_get_filipino-style_lechon_in_toronto/

Having tried most of the places on the list, one caught my eye; Mikes BBQ.
For some reason it got poor reviews here but since it was on BlogTO, I thought I'd give it a chance. 

Jack (owner?) greeted me with a huge warm Hello. He stopped what he was doing, grabbed a chair and sat with me. Even though the kitchen looked busy, he stopped everything to cater to me. Excellent customer service! - to top it off, he gave me a healthy sample of his charshiu(spelling?) which was to my high satisfactions. 

My Order: Lechon, Chicken Wings, Mixed Vegetables, Lumpia(spring rolls) - All Large orders in trays.

Lechon - VERY WELL PRICED!! About $200 for a large Lechon. That's a good 30-40% off the competition. *Deposit may be required*
Taste - You can order the standard shiney skin but I went with the BlogTO recommendation and ordered Crispy style(Chicharon-skin). Well cooked, moist, and crispy skin. I couldn't be more satisfied.

Chicken Wings - These are CRISPY AF!!(in a good way) Delicious and moist on the inside with a niiiiice crunch on the exterior. This will be my go to place for party wings aswell.

Mixed Veggies - No complaints. Standard veggies, delicious. 

Lumpia - no complaints either. Delicious and crispy, although I think this is ordered in, don't quote me, I'm not 100% sure. Ask for red dipping sauce which he makes on the spot. 

OVERALL, I'm very satisfied and will be a repeat customer. 

Be good to Jack. He's a good man, business owner, cook, and only aims to please his customers.

Only downside is the tight parking lot. Aim for midday-early evening pickup to avoid parking lot disasters and no parking."}
{"text":"Came here for some Chinese BBQ. It was around 7:00pm and I think they were going to close soon. They did not have too much meat left but still good enough for several more customers. Tried their roast pork and BBQ porkwith rice for $7.35 tax in.

The portions were really generous. There was almost more meat than rice. Quality is a bit on the lower end though. BBQ pork had lots of fat and was not as lean as I would like. The roast pork was a bit more lean. The skin on the roast pork was a bit stale but it was near closing time so I can't complain. 

The way they handle the meat was really nasty here. They grab the meat with their bare hands, chop up the meat and place it into your dish. I even witnessed them drop some meat on the counter and put it right into the meal. Nasty! 

There are two little tables inside but I do not know who in their right mind would eat right there. Everything was just poorly done and even the presentation was terrible. Its like they threw a pile of meat on top of the rice. I'm not expecting much but when compared to Chinese BBQ places like Lung Tung BBQ Food then its a world of a difference in taste, quality and presentation. Plus its the same price too.

Don't think I will return."}
{"text":"Mike, I am so Sorry! I don't think it will work out for us and there is not going to be a second date ever!

Your BBQ Pork and Roasted Duck with Rice ($5) was one of the worse Chinese BBQ I had! I know, it is just suppose to be a cheap date, I am expecting too much for $5 tax in lunch date  that includes a daily soup and you even throw in some tofu....

The rice was not hot... it was not cooked freshly!
BBQ Pork was like this orange colour with no taste at all!
The gravy on top was like a mushy filmed formed on top of pork and duck!

BTW, you are also such a bad dresser in need of a bath! Sticky floors, dirty tables....

I took off in the middle of our date, not because I have an emergency! I just can't do it!!

Bye! 

Please don't text, email or bbm me EVER!"}
