{"text":"The Roncesvalles Polish Festival is one of Toronto's last summer street festivals and it's usually  held in September each year and has been running for thirteen years. It runs on Roncesvalles Ave from essentially Queen St W to Dundas St W. The festival is a celebration of Polish culture and the Roncesvalle area is the perfect location since that area is considered the centre of the Polish community in Toronto.  It was my first your attending this festival and it was a lot better than I thought it would be and a lot busier. Not as busy as Taste of the Danforth but definitely very busy but still some room to walk around.  There were quite a few vendors and shops selling traditional Polish fare like cabbage rolls, pierogies, kielbasas and many other food items and they were reasonably priced fro a street festival. We tried some kielbasa, cheddar pierogies and cabbage rolls from Benna's Bakery & deli which came out to $4 (tax included) for each item and it was pretty good.  One thing they had that not many other street festivals had was beer tents, they had two beer tents which was set up by the organizers ($8 beers) and one beer tent from Steamwhistle ($5 beers) which really livened up the atmosphere and most adults enjoy an alcoholic beverage with their meal.  The main stage and some other stages had Polish music performances, there were also  carnival games, midway rides and street buskers which were a big hit especially for the children in attendance.  Overall, it's a really cool festival that has something for everyone and they did a really good job showcasing Polish culture even with the Roncesvalle area slowing gentrifying. It's a great event for people of all ages: teenagers, couples, seniors, friends looking for something to do and families. It's busy but not overwhelming."}
{"text":"Unlike the other festival on Danforth this is still a local secret and there is space to walk. Also has 2 beer gardens and 2 kiddies midways. I guess I should keep this to myself"}
{"text":"While there are a good number of vendors at this festival, they're also unusually spaced out. When I go to festivals, I want to see the vendors lined up in rows so I can walk from one vendor right up to the next one. However, there were intersections between streets that only had a few vendors before the next street, and there were also intersections where there were more vendors, but you'd still have to walk a few stores to get to another vendor. It made the walking experience quite long. A part of me thinks that practically speaking, they could have probably closed down less of the street and made the whole festival a tad more compact. But perhaps that's just personal preference.  For a festival called a Polish festival, I think there could have been more of Polish culture represented here. I mean, for sure there were more Polish booths than perhaps say any other one given culture represented there, but I don't believe even half of the booths at the festival were Polish. I'll be honest. I didn't finish walking the entire thing. I did most of it. Maybe I missed the predominantly Polish part?"}
{"text":"The Polish festival on Roncesvalles has been a tradition in my family and with my friends for many many years. Recently, I have found it losing some of its charm, but I still enjoy the pierogi and pickles on a stick that you can only find at a Polish festival. I will, of course, be attending next year!"}
