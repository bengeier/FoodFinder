{"text":"Nicest waitress. Worst service. Mediocre food. I understand we're at an amusement park. My husband suggested we go elsewhere to eat but based on reviews assured him it would be fine...I'll never hear the end of it."}
{"text":"Instant tea, brisket dry, cold slaw old, bloody chicken, bread taste store bought, sausage was store bought they don't even try to hide that, chocolate desert a 3 year old wouldn't  eat"}
{"text":"We ate here last time we stayed at great wolf and it was great. This time the food was not good. The waitress seemed like we were bothering her but she was nice. She did not clear a one of our plates so at the end the table was full. The chicken was very dried out like it was in a holding cabinet all day. I really hope this was a one time thing cause we really like this place"}
{"text":"Seems much improved based on reviews I read here prior to our visit.  We read and heard they had bad prices and poor food.  We had a very good experience.  The prices were 15-20 per adult and 8 for kids, very standard for a sit-down menu restaurant.  Food was very good.  Service was friendly.  We ate at 5pm to beat the rush, which never came on a Tuesday night.  It was nice to not eat at the crowded buffet nextdoor.  The grill had a dim and quiet atmosphere.  Highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"We were very happy with the food but our service was mediocre. We had both the salmon (surprisingly delicious!) and bbq platter. We didn't have very high expectations for the food but it was all very good except for the Cole slaw. We used a go play save coupon for the Raleigh area so it was basically bogo entree free. We are here on Wednesday night and plan on using our other coupon for tomorrow evening as well!"}
{"text":"Food was great. Service was okay they were training and were generally okay but I ordered a glass of wine that took way too long to get. It was a little pricey but seemed in line with what you would expect from a grill. This is in the Great Wolf Lodge amusement park so the prices were pretty much as expected."}
{"text":"Maybe we went on an off day? Is it always like this now? Idk last time we came to GWL we had great service and are food was really good. Last night the service was so disappointing and the food even more so. My son ordered a simple grilled cheese, they brought our Mac and cheese. It was sent back and we got a burnt sad looking grilled cheese that as a good sport he tried to eat around but couldn't.   What was really strange was the table next to us got all smiles from the server, the manager came over to wish one of the kids a happy birthday and they got free dessert. Now, I don't expect any of this but the manager passed by our table and not a peep. She knew we returned food  and could see the grilled cheese on the side not touched. I expected better, it was also my child's bday so I don't know why the different attitude from one table to the next. We're always very friendly and easy going so this experience was dissapointing."}
{"text":"Draft beer tasted flat.  Lobster bisque was horrible.  BBQ tray was disgusting...lodge made pickles had no flavor...brisket was dry and rubbery...mac & cheese was cold...sausage tasted frozen...ribs were not fall off the bone.  Ceasar salad came out as a whoe head/stalk of romaine lettuce with a couple drops of ceasar dressing...by the time I fought the lettuce I didnt even want to eat.  Kids chicken tenders tasted of fish.  Grilled cheese was about the size of my palm.  For the extremely high price it was not worth it at all!  Love Great Wolf Lodge but this restaurant was a no!"}
{"text":"Service was excellent. Food was ok. My salmon was cooked perfect but my sons tacos were extremely salty and he could not eat them."}
{"text":"Was back twice since my initial review & the service was greatly improved both times. The food is decent but not great. But it is convenient since you don't have to leave the resort. But if staying on site is not a priority, there are any number of eateries within a couple of miles.  Again, if you're here during a busy time of the year, I recommend  making reservations. They make it very easy to do so on the GWL website."}
{"text":"Order the Cuban Sandwich. Bread was a little burnt, would have been better, if wasn't burnt. Fries was good. Service was good. Overall you can go out and get something better."}
{"text":"The staff was friendly and the food was good after a long day, but the service was terribly slow. There were all of two families seated on our side and the rest of the place was empty. I think it would have been a good experience if we didn't have to wait so long for our food and to see someone to get the check. What should have been a quick lunch turned into an long ordeal and I question if that is why the place is empty to begin with. Hopefully they work on the service to make it a place where someone doesn't feel like they are eating in a ghost town."}
{"text":"Stayed at Great Wolf Lodge for my daughter's 9th Birthday. Dinner was ok and filling, but overpriced for what we got. In a resort like this with the cost already high and paying for every little thing else, it soured our experience. Could be better and/or better priced for families. Wait staff was very nice. We will not be back to Great Wolf for what the whole cost and experience we had as a whole."}
{"text":"We dined on Saturday evening 2/4 and had a minor service blip at the start of our visit - we sat at our table for close to 20 minutes without anyone coming to greet us. I finally got up just to let the host know our table may have been overlooked... From that point on the staff took such great care of us and were so apologetic and kind, it wasn't that big of a deal but the way everyone did their best to remedy the situation was really impressive. The food was good - we didn't have high expectations but everything was fresh and as described. We would definitely come back if we get a chance to visit Great Wolf Lodge in the future."}
{"text":"For resort food I guess it's okay. My BBQ chicken salad was amazing. Kids chicken fingers were pretty terrible. How about a fresh fruit cup as a side option. Slaw was watery. Beef ribs weren't tender. And why do I have to pay extra for anything kids drink other than milk or juice? For a kids resort it wasn't a good choice. Out of two adults and three kids I was the only one who lives my food."}
{"text":"Not sure what I was expecting from a resort / theme park restaurant, but this place failed on many levels. After ordering, our food took approximately 50 minutes to come out - and by \"food\" I'm talking about 2 kids taco meals, kids chicken fingers meal, a grilled chicken Caesar salad and chicken / shrimp risotto. Not only was the 50 min slightly annoying, but the fact it was also cold made it worse. Add on not a single refill of water and well this meal was a FAIL. Extremely glad the water park is a 5-Star because the \"best\" restaurant on property is far from it.    The only reason for 2 stars is I called from our room to make a reservation and was told for a party of 5 the soonest would be 1.25 hrs from the time of my call, but after a short pause, the hostess asked if we could come right away they could seat us. So, we quickly got 3 little ones ready and off we went. We were seated right away, and well that was the best part of the meal, second was leaving.   I'd recommend going off property for better options."}
{"text":"Dined here with the family to avoid the buffet. Food was good not great. Friendly service and was quiet. I had the shrimp and faro salad. If looking for something upscale would probably recommend going off property to dine. Otherwise a decent option."}
