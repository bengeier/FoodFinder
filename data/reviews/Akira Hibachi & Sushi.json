{"text":"Service is terrible.  We have been here a few times & getting someone to wait on you for sushi is impossible.  The last time we went we waited 30 minutes for menus & then tried to track down someone to even take our order.  The sushi is great but plan on around two hours of waiting even when they're slow."}
{"text":"One of the better sushi options in the area. My wife and I started going there after some Japanese students of hers recommended it. It is often quite busy so reservations would be a good idea on weekends or holidays.

We have had great service and excellent food every time we've gone."}
{"text":"Fantastic food and service. Definitely worth the money or effort to come here. Best I've been to."}
{"text":"Not very good.  Got the ahi tuna steak.  Cooked until beyond dead (asked for rare).  Very very very salty.  Maybe the sushi is good.  If I ever go back, I will order sushi.  My friends got the chicken and described it as average.  Also, the bus person refused to take either the soup or salad that were a. gross and b. essentially untouched from the table.  I supposed they didn't think anyone would find either repulsive.  Ok, the soup was very pretty."}
{"text":"We love this place! I have  been to plenty of hibachi places and this one of my favs! The owner is super friendly and always makes sure everything is ok! The dipping sauces are very good too! They even have lunch prices on the weekends which is really nice! Its not too loud like some hibachi places!"}
{"text":"I have been here countless times for birthdays and other celebrations. I personally love this place. We have never had bad service or issues with our food. The food itself is very good and the hibachi experience is always very fun. I usually get the steak and chicken combo with a shrimp appetizer. My meat is always cooked to perfection. This probably is relatively Americanized compared to other places I have been, but is overall good and a fun experience."}
{"text":"The owner Anna makes this a 5 star. She is so friendly and caring. For my daughter's graduation she stayed open longer so we could have a good dinner to celebrate even though we had no idea when commencement would end. 

It is always fun watching the chiefs at Hibachi restaurants entertain you as they cook. The portions and good, the food was tasty and prices are typical."}
{"text":"Worst hibachi experience. I love hibachi in general. This is ranked last in my list. Explained why it was empty on Sunday lunch.  The chef came in on the grill... Acted like someone forced him to cook for us... Obviously no show & tricks... I had to ask him to cook chicken more because he was ready to serve half cooked chken..
Sake was the worst I ever had. Never again!!"}
{"text":"They really know how to make a special birthday celebration! Very clean grille and enthusiastic wait staff! The food is fresh and the wine list, NOT BAD, not great but ok selection. Children love this place!!!!!!"}
{"text":"This is one of our favorite \"celebration\" restaurants.  The kids (12 and 14) really enjoy watching the chefs cook.  There is definitely a difference among the cooks in terms of entertainment value - I'd say about half the time we get a playful cook who really does a show.  We've ordered nearly everything (not all in the same visit!) off the hibachi menu and have never been disappointed, although the salmon is not as good as the other choices.  The servings are huge and we always bring home leftovers.  We really enjoy the seating - if you wind up with others who are outgoing and talkative it can be a lot of fun to chat (and be prepared to chat, because the service can be slow).  If you go at a popular time, be sure to make reservations!  Overall, a good solid meal and great for kids."}
{"text":"First time in area and what a gem!  Anna the owner greeted everyone personally....a nice touch.  Absolutely the best toro, you would be challenged to find better in the whole US!   Spicy scallops were incredible, they redefined my expectation of scallops.   Will definitely dine here again."}
{"text":"Visited there last night. Service was awful. Busser man was the most pleasant. Hostess stared at us when we arrived. Then waitress had a difficult time communicating or providing information.  Hibachi chef was decent and food overall was very good.  The service was just a bit distracting from the experience. You certainly didn't feel welcome or they were happy to have you there. 

However, food was good and we did the Tuesday special. Value for the food we received was good too."}
{"text":"The sushi is always fresh and delicious.
Anna the owner always greets us with a big smile and a big hug"}
{"text":"It was quite busy on a Friday night, but the wait is fairly short.

If you want hibachi than you know what you're getting.  The show and the smell of grease on your clothes.  

If you want sushi than you can sit at the bar.  I had the Alaska Roll, it was ok. For $6.95 the six pieces were a bit on the small side.  

I also got the tempura shrimp, scallops, calamari and vegetables.  The miso soup was really good.  The salad was a salad but the Ginger-esque salad dressing was not good.  There is so much ginger it's bitter.  The presentation of the tempura was beautiful.  I got 4 shrimp, 2 scallops and one calamari ring cut in half to be two.  Then some broccoli, yams, and squash.  Overall not bad, fairly crispy but light on the seafood. 

The atmosphere is fine, but again sitting within walking distance of the hibachi grill will leave you smelling like grease.  The service for our table seemed slow, but the table next to us who had a different waitress seemed to constantly be getting attention."}
{"text":"I have been coming here since 1999 and the food has been top quality ever since! The hibachi is the best in cleveland, and better than most places I have been in other states. The sushi is so fresh that I very rarely deviate getting raw fish anywhere else in the area. For the hibachi I recommend the steak and shrimp dinner (rib eye instead of NY strip) and for sushi you cannot pass up the volcano roll!"}
{"text":"I've been here a half dozen times, usually for birthdays or other celebration gatherings so we're in a private area in the back.  The owner always makes sure we have a splendid time.  Our food has always been great.  Now here's my dilemma.  My husband hates sitting with random strangers...yet I love hibachi.  Thankfully, at Akira, you get the best of both worlds and they have private tables you can sit at while still eating hibachi!  Bonus!  The food also comes out much, much faster since you're not watching them cook it.  I'm sure we'll be back!"}
{"text":"Came here for a hibachi dinner to celebrate my husband's birthday. There was a Two for Tuesday deal for $25, so we ordered shrimp and gambled on calamari. I was very impressed with their calamari, so I would get that again.  The shrimp was OK but not the best version I've had from a hibachi. Our cook had a bit of trouble getting the onion volcano going and dropped a few shrimps along the way - which he was generous in replacing. I didn't mind, but I mention it since it was extremely busy for a Tuesday and I could tell the staff were overworked - so mainly, I felt a bit bad for everyone running around and the customers who were waiting.

The sauce was OK and as expected - lots of butter and sodium in the meal. Nothing was truly remarkable about the food or experience, but the price was really nice for our Tuesday deal, so... Meh.  Just come here for a low-key Hibachi dinner."}
{"text":"I absolutely LOVE Akira! Just about everyone in our family is a member of the birthday club, where you get a free Hibachi meal during the month of your birthday! Yes - you can go anytime during that month!! Much better than those darn birthday clubs that you can only utilize on your actual birth date. The hostess is amazing - she is super friendly and so funny. When we went this past time the service was a little slow - it took a waitress about 7-8 minutes to come take our drink order after we sat down... But other than that it was fantastic. The hostess immediately came over and apologized for the wait so that made up for it. The food is delicious, and in my opinion they have the best sauces out of all the hibachi places I have been to in Northeast Ohio! Love them and would highly recommend them - ask to join the birthday club when you go! :)"}
{"text":"6:00 pm reservations on a Saturday evening for a party of 8. The hostess, an older lady perhaps named Candy, was so very rude...and it appeared as though she was training a younger lady. I hope that younger lady doesn't pick up her terrible customer service habits! 
Food: was fair at best. There is no synchronization of cooking so a few of us received our seafood while the vegetables were cooking, then came the rice, then came the beef. I never had scallops, veggies and rice on my plate at the same time. We couldn't eat our dinners together.  I know this restaurant gets pretty good reviews...I have no idea why."}
{"text":"Never again will l dine there,my order was totally wrong. The manager who was extremely  rude and to be honest racist,wanted me to still pay for the food,which I ultimately didn't.I just paid for the drink I had.That was my first time, and definitely the last time I'll ever eat there."}
{"text":"The place is cute and the food was adequate, but not spectacular. One of our sushi rolls was heaped with so much mayonnaise we literally had to scrap a great deal of it off to make it edible.  By far the highlight of the meal was the wasabi dumplings, they were delicious.  The tempura appetizer was also well prepared.  The calamari appetizer was served with a little cup of jarred tex-mex style salsa which I thought was very odd, and did not compliment the otherwise nicely prepared calamari at all.  The biggest thing was the temperature of the restaurant.  The owner kept stopping by the table to apologize for the 60 degree (and falling) room temperature but no matter how she fidgeted with the thermostat it never got any better. We all ended up wearing our coats for most of the meal.   Anyway, it was not an altogether horrible experience, but there are two sushi/hibachi places that are much closer to home that have markedly superior food and don't seem to have the dining room set to frosty."}
{"text":"I'm admittedly a sushi-nut and have been fortunate to have eaten at some incredible sushi establishments over the years.  This sushi is passable.  We ate at the sushi bar and found our chef to be relatively new and not very warm, perhaps out of his insecurity since he went out of his way to say he was new which didn't instill a great deal of confidence in us.  All that being said, he did fine and the quality of the product was average.

The rest of the staff left a little bit to be desired - they were quick to argue in front of patrons but were timely and polite otherwise.

If you're in a pinch and really want sushi, Akira will do fine but if you're looking for a real experience, keep looking."}
{"text":"This place is a pretty standard, Benihana-type establishment.  Food was average at best. If you live out here and it's nearby I suppose its worth it to pop in, but if you have to drive more than 10 minutes to get here it's not worth it."}
{"text":"This restaurant has potential. However, the managers are rude, petty, racist, biased, and indifferent. I invited my family to this restaurant to celebrate three family birthdays. To my dismay, one family member was completely disrespected due to the fact that he could not eat the sushi that he mistakenly ordered. The manger tried to force him to pay for food he could not eat. She didn't offer to prepare an alternative dish for him. She was rude and obnoxious toward him and said, \"don't ever come here again.\""}
{"text":"Everytime I come here, I leave full! Anna always has a smile on her face and is so sweet! Romeo is a my favorite cook overall and everytime he cooks for my table it's delicious. Their California roll is amazing and always made fresh!"}
{"text":"I really enjoyed the sushi here.  It certainly didn't hold it's weight against some large city specialty places but for local, well priced, good quality sushi this is the place.  Definitely will go back!"}
{"text":"I recently went for my nieces birthday. It was my first time at the restaurant and my last. It took over 30 minutes for the waitress to even come back with our beverages. Our Chef did not come out until about 45 minutes after. However, that was not the issue the issue was the shrimp. A few of us ordered shrimp and I noticed right away that a majority of my shrimp was not deveined properly. I brought to the attend of others in our party. I decided to just not eat the shrimp and to not make a fuss about it. Someone else in our party decided to let the manager know. Long story short, the manager claimed that that is how they serve their shrimp and that is she didn't like it to not order it on her next visit. After hearing that I decided that I would not be returning to Akira. Their service is lacking and the food in my opinion was not that great."}
{"text":"Excellent hibachi"}
{"text":"Great little hibachi spot. The cook was very nice and did a great job of entertaining our group, which was 1/2 kids. The waitress did try to rush us though - not even 5 minutes after we sat down she asked us if we could hurry up and place our order so she could get started preparing for the chef. None of us had even had the opportunity to look at the menu yet. When we said that we needed a few minutes she said, ok then I can't guarantee how long you'll wait then. It was just odd - we weren't in a rush and when we did order, the chef was very prompt. We were celebrating a 10th birthday and the chef made the # 10 our of the rice when he was cooking and took a picture with the birthday boy, such a nice touch!! The food was great! A bit salty but that's to be expected. We went for lunch and the portions were just as large as any hibachi dinner and it was under $10 per person! (Unless you order steak)"}
{"text":"We came here with friends who eat here on a weekly basis.  They got a ton of rolls which are discounted at happy hour.  I was pleased to find that they had a good variety of cooked japanese dishes that are a bit harder to find -- like tuna collar -- at a reasonable price.  The menu is long, and kids (and adults) can enjoy watching the hibachi.  Dinner and a show!  Sake and beer are heavily discounted at happy hour too."}
{"text":"Solid hibachi restaurant with super friendly staff and service. Food comes fast, tastes good, isn't as greasy as other hibachi places I've been to, and very reasonably priced, especially for lunch. It was also family friendly, and I could not believe how accommodating they were to my baby! Would definitely come again and again."}
{"text":"A bit pricey. Weirdest thing is that each table seats 8, so sometimes several unrelated parties are grouped together and management will not allow more than four credit cards per table. Makes for a pretty awkward situation if everyone pays their own bill, doesn't have cash, and wants to use a credit card.

Anyway, like many hibachi places, the food is cooked on a large surface built into the table. The chefs try to do some tricks with flames and joke around with customers (but not disparagingly).
This place has nice chefs but not as much fun as other hibachi places around town (though maybe for a business lunch I'd rather not have shrimp thrown at me).
Food is just OK, kind of greasy and usually the smell sticks to your clothes."}
{"text":"I am a regular here I always come here for during my lunch break. Anna the owner is a sweetheart and she is always very welcoming. I've had both their sushi and their hibachi and I am pleased with both of them. Their lunch specials are very good."}
{"text":"Our favorite hibachi place in the whole area.  Excellent service with attention to details. Food is spectacular- and cooked fresh in front of you. \"The show\" is different each time you go. Highly recommend the teriyaki steak- one of the cheaper items, but full of great flavor and awesomeness. Never a complaint, even in busy days like Mother's Day and Christmas Eve."}
{"text":"Did not eat habachi. Sat at the bar and ate a tuna nigiri ($5.50) and an udon noodle ($14.50 + $2.00 for chicken and beef). Tuna was below average. Was not fresh and had virtually zero flavor. Udon was average. Beef was marinated perfectly and was very tender. Chicken was extremely overdone. Entire dish was coated in butter/oil. Ginger dressing with salad was slightly above average. Miso was as expected.

Service was friendly after they finally came over to us. Probably will not return."}
{"text":"I have been to many Japanese restaurant before and this one is so far the worst! The service is awful. Took them 40 mins to serve our food then another 30 min waiting to get a check. There was only a few table of people inside.The food was a total waste too. Everything was too salty. They put way too much flour to fry the tiny pieces of seafood just to make them look bigger, sure is a good way to save them $$$. I also ordered a lamb rack. On the menu it shows a rack of lamb. But the actual plate was filled with pre cooked hibachi rice with 3 skinny pieces of lamb chops.And of course the meat tasted like nothing but a chunk of salt. After I walked out of there my hair and my clothes smelled like that oily hibachi. Even though I did not sit at the hibachi table at all!"}
{"text":"Hmm where to start.   The service is pretty good. Very friendly  and kid friendly.  They asked if we needed separate checks since our party was large! Drinks are reasonable. We had 15 people and a few kids. I did not understand why they did not put us in the special hibachi room?

Super Clevelandesque hibachi.  Good salad dressing. Thick mayo based YUM YUM sauce. Good ginger sauce.  The miso soup was not very hot, and could have used a little more miso paste.
Apps-
The calamari and shiitake mushroom apps were  tiny and very average.  10 or so small calamari rings and about a couple of tablespoons of shitake shrooms. 

I peeked the sushi bard and the fish did not look very good. The tuna looked like that pink crap you can get at giant eagle. 

We asked for the steaks medium rare and they cooled well done. Very average beef quality. The vegetables and fried rice did not have much flavor.  The fried rice was just rice and egg. 

My bill was 37 bucks: steak and chicken combo, calamari app. and a beer.   You can definitely do better, not really much bang for the buck. My steak was cooked well done and I ordered it medium rare.

i did not try the sushi but I peeped the fish at the sushi bar and it looked like buffet quality fish. 

The show was  not very entertaining, not really funny  and or  much interaction.  I would advise that if there are no coupons,  go to one of the mall Japanese joints."}
{"text":"Over this is a wonderful restaurant!  In many ways it was fairly comprable to most other Japanese Hibachi restaurants I've been to.  My date and I didn't eat at the Hibachi grill seating and sat at a private table, so I can't comment on the Hibachi chefs.  Se ordered the volcano roll and I ordered the salmon grill dinner.  Both of us enjoyed our food very much!  Sake was good, and service was in fact some of the best I've had in a long time.  Will be back for sure."}
{"text":"Classic hibachi always delicious and comical. Nothing too spectacular here vs any other hibachi place. They are always a good time and the food stays consistent as well. Best part here is the desert. Chocolate Raspberry Ice Cream is a must save room for."}
{"text":"We must have caught the owner (that everyone raves about on here) on an off night. After about 15 minutes of waiting for someone to take our drink order, we asked the hostess if we could get a server to our table. After another ten minutes of waiting we asked again and someone finally came. Not ideal with two hungry kids at dinner time. On the plus side, the sushi was very good and hibachi chef was entertaining."}
{"text":"Worst hibachi experience. I love hibachi in general. This is ranked last in my list. Explained why it was empty on Sunday lunch.  The chef came in on the grill... Acted like someone forced him to cook for us... Obviously no show & tricks... I had to ask him to cook chicken more because he was ready to serve half cooked chken..
Sake was the worst I ever had. Never again!!"}
{"text":"The service is fabulous and the food is really good. The sushi is also amazing! I've had no issue with the service here and the hibachi is always fresh and delicious. Their yum yum sauce is superb, I usually get two instead of one and the other sauce."}
{"text":"I don't get the meh reviews on here. Akira is a great little place in Solon. The owner, Anna, is the sweetest ever. She'll always greet you with a big hug and cares about your experience.

I tend not to sit at the hibachi tables, because I usually end up getting seated with a huge boisterous party, making a small dinner with my guest awkward. Instead, I always opt to sit at a table and still order the hibachi. The service is sooo fast at the tables. The chicken/shrimp hibachi is totally solid, and they always have interesting promotions going on. The last time I visited Akira, they had a list of drinks 1/2 price in honor of the Olympics.

My guests and I have never actually ordered something we didn't like. I've found all the food to be fresh, tasty, and everything i've expected, maybe sometimes a little more (especially when it comes to the sushi). Don't let the strip mall deceive you-- Akira is a nice and inviting spot for dinner. They also have a cute private room in the back, if you're looking for a space for a celebration or private gathering. Speaking of celebrations, if you sign up for their e-mails (which don't come often), they'll send you a birthday coupon for a free entree. Akira is a legit choice for some great Japanese hibachi!"}
{"text":"Overall: Locally owned hibachi location, with excellent food and very good service.

Food: 5 stars.  I've always been impressed with quality ingredients and cooked properly.  You usually get enough food to take an extra full meal home.  The sushi menu is impressive and unique too.

Service: 5 stars.  The owner (Anna?) always seems to be there, and greets almost all the guests.  The hibachi cooks are fun and do the usual act.  The servers are good.

Price: 4 stars.  The prices are reasonable, especially for lunch.  Chicken hibachi is $7.95 lunch and $16.00 for dinner.  

Appearance: 4 stars.  Most of the restaurant are hibachi tables, but there are some regular tables too.  It looks like most hibachi type restaurants."}
{"text":"First time here. Came to celebrate the graduation of a family member. Our reservation ran pretty late. Anna, the owner was very apologetic. Our service was just ok... but our chef was FANTASTIC. I'm as picky as they come! I will be back for sure"}
{"text":"Love this place. Great food and even greater hospitality!! Anna (owner) will welcome you with big smile and all staff always ready to go above and beyond to give you great hibachi experience."}
{"text":"My favorite NE Ohio sushi and hibachi place. Service is very friendly, food is tasty, sushi is good. Some of the Japanese students at a local college suggested it to me as they liked it. Great place to get your sushi fix!"}
{"text":"We came here with a living social voucher. The staff was very friendly. The hibatchi chef was fun. The food was great. I'm a big fan of hibatchi and this is up there in my list of restaurants now. Enjoy."}
{"text":"The service is awesome! If you are looking for great hibachi in a relaxed atmosphere, this is the place for you."}
{"text":"Been coming here for years and it's great every time. Cooks are great lunch is a great value for the amount of food you get and as is dinner. Staff is always friendly."}
{"text":"Went here for lunch to take my mom's friend all the way from China visiting us. She had never experienced hibachi before so I thought it would be perfect. 

Prices are high for lunch! They did have bento boxes available but again, they were stupid expensive and only had sushi and sashimi instead of any katsu, teriyaki, tempura items. Menu was big but not varied. Staff was lackluster and the hibachi was a bit half-assed. I think my parents and the friend did enjoy their food but didn't think it was anything impressive. Portions were medium sized. 

Location gets an A+ from me because it's smack in the middle of my fave shopping center in Solon and also close as balls to my parents' house. However, it'll take a free lunch pass to get me to come here again of my own volition."}
{"text":"Not good like it used to be. Food is not good service is worst. I will say they do have great sushi.
We used to eat here a lot. But no more.


Well tried again nothing has changed the chicken so tough could not even cut like rubber. I want to like this restaurant but it's just not good. I tried expensive and inedible. I will say it is very clean 
Service is a 4-5 depends on the night. Sorry I could not give more of a positive review but no way."}
{"text":"I came here with people from work a couple times. It was alright. The hibachi grill guy was a real smart ass. He took it too far with some of his anecdotes. It is good for the price and only came here because work people like it. On the second visit, the chef made a volcano out of an onion. That is always pretty cool to look at."}
{"text":"Good staple in Solon; lots of children, nice and clean.

Not as flashy as Wasabi, cleaner than Benihana and has a solid menu.  It's not really my first pick, but is a solid choice when the entire family, including the nieces and nephews want to get together. They offer ribeye, which is nice.  However, as with many Japanese steakhouses, ordering your steak rare or medium rare is a hard-to-understand concept.  

The salad and soup were good - nothing spectacular.  Shrimp appetizer was also good.  I really enjoyed the busboy, who brought my my Sriracha liberally.  

Of course I will be back, but I prefer Wasabi because of the atmosphere, the noodles and the sushi,"}
{"text":"Anna (owner) is a big reason I continue to go to Akira. She truly cares about her customers and goes above and beyond to keep them happy. I usually sit at a regular table in the bar area. The sushi is always fresh and delicious. I highly recommended both the mushroom soup and house salad. The salad dressing is the closest thing to Benihana ginger dressing. You can't go wrong with any item on the menu. Patience is required sometimes due to being understaffed. Go check it out for yourself."}
{"text":"I have tried at least a dozen Hibachi places and this is BY FAR the best one I have ever been to.  I challenge people to give me names of others, I'll be happy to try them and compare!!  Their ginger salad dressing is to DIE for.  And I don't know what it is about their hibachi food but it is just excellent.  You have to try their shrimp sauce which comes as a side with your meal. Unbelievably good!!  I think they have fixed their \"only 4 bills per table\" rule which was pretty much the only complaint I have ever had here."}
