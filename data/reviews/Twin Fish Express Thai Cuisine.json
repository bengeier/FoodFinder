{"text":"A nice addition to the Queensway with this second location for Twin Fish Thai Cuisine. 

Small, but cozy with a modern decor. Located in a strip mall across from the Sobeys/Winners. We were the only ones there that night, their location is a bit hard to spot - tucked into the far corner.

No liquor license yet, (this may have since changed). Service was good, although our server seemed distinctly new at it. Only one small complaint about the ambiance - the incessant Christian music. 

I started off with the crispy nest roll - delicate, crunchy, a hint of spice - yummy! R had the crispy calamari, and claims it was the best calamari he's ever had! Flavourful, tender & crisp - not in the least bit rubbery. Both were quite good, but IMO the thai chili dipping sauce in general could use some innovation.

R gave the chef carte blanche to serve him whatever he wanted as long as it was spicy! He got the spicy basil chicken. It was a generous portion, nicely seasoned, spicy, served with rice.

I got the red snapper in spicy red curry. It was sooooo good. Took the leftovers home and although the crispness didn't hold up well of course, it was just as tasty the next day.

We'll be back, but only eat-in after they get their liquor license - after all there's nothing better than spicy thai with a cold beer!"}
{"text":"Great food, great service, beautiful decor, highly recommend! The green curry with coconut rice was a nice touch. The spice can really build up. 

Soli deo gloria."}
