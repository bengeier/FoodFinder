{"text":"Tried this restaurant for the second time and once again it didn't leave a great impression. I ordered the lemongrass chicken banh mi and mango bubble.  The bubbles were frozen and inedible. However, they do use real mango juice. The banh mi was not worth the price...sandwiches at Banh Mi & Ti in Lawrenceville have more variety and are actually reasonably priced."}
{"text":"Bahnmilicious is great Vietnamese cuisine. I have visited twice, and was impressed both times. I had the Tacos and Bahn Mi sandwich. Each time they were accompanied by the Bone Broth. The service was fast and friendly. The dishes were very, very fresh. The tastes were perfect, and the portions nice. If you want a great meal and experience, visit Bahnmilicious, which is currently located in the Strip's Smallman Galley."}
{"text":"I had the lemon grass chicken Banh mi with Vietnamese coffee. 

The sandwich was good, interesting with the au jour sauce on the side. Skimpy on the meat, but what can you do?

This review is really directed to the \"Vietnamese coffee\". I've had my share of different places making Vietnamese coffee, and I've made the \"slow drip\" coffee at home as well. Their Vietnamese coffee should be called something else because it tastes like chocolate milk. As I sipped the light tan color beverage full of ice, I kept thinking to myself, \"is this a mistake? It has to be. No Vietnamese coffee should taste like this.\"

So to be fair and not assuming things, I went back to the place to ask if the drink I am consuming is the correct one because it doesn't really taste like Vietnamese coffee at all. The staff very nicely told me that their Vietnamese coffee is an espresso shot *check* with condense milk *check* and half and half *whaaaaaat???*

If I knew that I was getting a Thai ice tea inspired Vietnamese coffee, I would've opt to drink something else. 

In conclusion, if this was known to be a \"fusion Banh mi place\"; sure, I would expect different twists with their menu items, but half and half in a Vietnamese coffee? I rather get a regular milk tea then."}
{"text":"I've been wanting to try this place since a few of my colleagues highly recommended it. There was so much variety on the menu I wanted to sample it all but settled on Bahn Mi because is came with a salad and the bone broth pho that i was dying to try. 

The bone broth was out of this world with flavor. I never had anything like that before. It's a must have if you go there. I have had Bahn Mi before but this was the by far the best I ever had. The flavors and freshness were perfect. My friend got the summer rolls. She said they were really good, especially the peanut sauce.

The service was super friendly, quick and informative when I had questions about the menu. Loved everything about this place!"}
{"text":"I have eaten here twice, two days in a row actually! I came here after work on a Friday, early (like 4ish) and there was no line, the food was super fast to come out. I got a bahn mi with chicken and fried rolls (not egg rolls the other ones). The bahn mi had great flavor, but was not as good as other bahn mi I have had around town. The rolls were way too oily and I only ate 1 of the 3. 

The second day I was there, I actually came back because I saw that their special was chicken curry, this was amazing! The noodles were perfectly cooked, it had the right amount of spice, everything was fresh, the curry was 5 stars for sure.

Overall, I would go back again, also, my husband had the pork bahn mi and said that it needed more sauce, but it was the most meat that he had ever gotten in bahn mi, which is a plus from him."}
{"text":"We were in town visiting and came across this location while walking through the strip district. 

You order at the counter and then sit at a table, that you choose, and they bring the food to you. There is bus staff that then brings you a bottle of water and glasses. 

There are 4 different food vendors to choose from within this location, so it is nice if different people you are with want different things. 

We ordered the banh mi with pulled pork. I thought it was really good and a generous size. I got the ginger salad as my side and I loved that. The bread was super soft and good as well. 

I would definitely eat here again!"}
{"text":"As much as I wanted to love Banhmilicious, I did not. I was not too impressed with their brunch menu and that was definitely factored into my rating. Their main focus is on Bahn mi, which I suppose I should give it a try before I knock the place completely. I ordered the jasmine rice and Chinese sausage ($12) which came with Jasmine rice topped with a fried egg which was topped with Chinese sausage. The cucumber, picked vegetables, and sweet sauce was left on the side for mixing. There was nothing that blew me away with the flavor and honestly I left feeling hungry still. You definitely do not get much bang for you buck. In my opinion, this is not the place for brunch. But I would give it a shot for lunch!"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I just moved to Pittsburgh and have been exploring a wide variety of the unique restaurants this city has to offer. We had a great experience at Banhmilicious! The bone broth had great depth of flavor and felt very nourishing to eat. The spring rolls were great too! We can't wait to go back and try more delicious dishes from their menu."}
{"text":"I so wanted to love this place, but sadly it was very underwhelming.

We ordered the bahn mi summer rolls (?) and the bahn mi. The summer rolls were very greasy and tasted the same. We didn't even finish them. The bahn mi left much to be desired. There were very little picked veggies and they skimped on the protein. For $12, I was very disappointed. 

Go see Lucy outside of Bar Marco for a tastier fuller bahn mi for $7."}
{"text":"I have eaten here three times so far over the last month or two, and it has been consistently great. There are a number of places in Pittsburgh to get Banh Mi/Vietnamese food, so one definitely has options. I have been choosing this place as my option because it is just all around a good experience. 
     The top things I would recommend off the menu are the Banh Mi (obviously), the tacos, and the Pho bone broth. When I ate here last Friday I had the tacos with pulled pork, and it was fantastic. I plan to try the noodles next time I go back. 
     Also incidentally, this place is located within Smallman Galley, for anyone who is not familiar. They have a bar there which is a great place to get a drink, either before or after you eat. As I said previously, I was there last Friday night, and it had a nice crowd. Most people were, similarly to me, at the bar to have a drink after eating at Banhmilicious."}
{"text":"The food was good, but it wasn't anything special, especially for the price I paid. The portion size was decent, but I felt there was not enough chicken, especially because it was pretty pricey. I got jasmine rice, lettuce, pickled veggies, cucumbers, saut√©ed green onion, and zizzle singe bwwaak grilled lemongrass chicken. It was good, but again, nothing special. The workers were very kind though. Banhmilicious is located within Smallman Galley, and it is very similar to a \"food court style\" where you order the food, take a number, and then sit down and they bring you food. There are several other restaurants in this small space. There is also a separate bar. You kind of have to find your own table and a waiter will come by to fill cups of water and give you napkins/utensils, but that's about it."}
{"text":"I feel that Bahnmilicious has to put a lot more meat and pickled veggies on their sandwich to justify charging $12.00. I do not feel it is currently a good value at all. I tried the bone broth at the Yelp Elite Event and it was delicious. I could actually see charging $6.00 for this little bowl of broth before $12.00 for the Bahn Mi."}
{"text":"This restaurant is one of four in the building. The Vietnamese iced coffee was delicious. I also had the smoked salmon poke bowl. The smoked salmon was perfect and had just enough smoke flavor. Presentation was beautiful. I wished I had more salmon and less rice. The rice was hot which was kind of odd. I've never had poke with hot rice. It didn't ruin the dish but I would have preferred it cold."}
{"text":"Great little spot...a bit confusing logistically, but the food was worth it...great, tasty bowl of noodles. A great quick stop for a very tasty treat!"}
{"text":"I have been drooling over the Instagram posts tagged from Banhmilicious for a while now.  I was lucky to get to visit this past Saturday for a brunch meal. My boyfriend and I tried the Bacon & Egg Fried Rice. It was very interesting and delicious like nothing I've had before. The fried rice is a smaller than usual grain type and served with a fried egg on top and a side of soup. The soup appears to be a clear or an onion soup you would have at a everyday Asian spot, but once you taste it you realize its SO much more. Its almost like a spiced latte or strong chai tea - but meets the starter soup you'd have at a hibachi place. I asked and the soup features cinnamon, ginger, 5 spice and cumin (if I can remember correctly). I think it might be bone broth based over vegetable as well. We also had the mango bubble tea which was filled with fresh mango. It was nice & refreshingly sweet :)"}
{"text":"Smallman Galley is a very cool concept which allows chefs to explore and become a launching pad for their career.  It is a smaller food hall with only 4 restaurants and a bar but it still gives you a lot of variety to try.  In general, the food hall has that cool industrial vibe and it is run similar to a cafeteria where you order at the counter of each restaurant and then you find a seat.  We came twice here and I will say it gets VERY busy during dinner and good luck getting a table.  It can be quite hard.

Bahnmiliicious is one of the restaurant and it specializes in Vietnamese street food.  They have a variety different dishes... you can have the traditional sandwich banh mi, summer rolls (fresh rice rolls), vermicelli bowl, rice bowl, and tacos.  You choose what you want to be filled in it and then it's all made.

I ordered the vegetarian summer rolls, mango bubble drink, and the iced Vietnamese coffee.  I would say ordering is the easiest part.  The food delivery is quite funny as you see your food whizzing by you because they can't see clearly the table number to give you the dishes.  I consistently have chased down all 5 orders as they couldn't deliver.

Vegetarian Summer Rolls - Ive had a few of these more as an app than an entree.  You have 4 of them made and they were well wrapped up so nothing fell apart.  I didnt feel anything was old or stale but there wasn't a lot of flavour to summer roll.  Usually the herbs or pickled vegetables would give a punch but these were very mild.  I felt there was a lot of rice vermicelli which is really quite bland to start.  There is a sauce that is provided but it didnt give much relief on flavour 3/5

Mango Bubbles - Bubble tea is a bit of nostalgia drink.  These weren't too bad as they werent super sugary and I felt there was a decent amount of mango juice.  The bubbles though were really quite hard and the large amount of ice in it prevented the straw to even get to the bubbles.  It's not bad but much to be improved 3/5

Iced Vietnamese Tea - This was actually nice and refreshing.  There is a strong coffee flavour with the creamy condensed milk to give a dessert like finish to the evening.  They did add a lot of ice but seeing how hot it was, it was needed.  3.5/5

I really wish these chefs a great start, improve with each lesson learned, and become successful."}
{"text":"My first time at Smallman and I decided to check out the Banh Mi place despite some low ratings on Yelp. I am SO glad I did! I got it with tofu and bone broth on the side and it was amazing. The baguette was a little softer than traditional which I didn't mind because it made it easier to eat. The sauce on it was so delicious and had just the right amount of crunch and chewy. The portion was a good size and, with the broth to warm me up, I was very satisfied. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"Had brunch here. Pumpkin French toast was pretty good. Tasty and nice presentation. Food was a little cold by time it arrived. Very, very, very slow. Somewhat over priced too. Hopefully they can improve."}
