{"text":"First thing they served was a glass of flat, warm coke; fortunately the waiter was able to get a can of coke.   Bread, although hot, was tasteless and served with unsalted packaged butter.   The caprese salad was okay, but given the price, you'd think they would not serve you stale, yellow arugula.  The seafood pasta was decent but the bucatini was no good.   Despite being one of the few Italian restaurants in Markham and we love Italian food... We will not be returning. Overall a meh experience even when not considering the prices. No wonder it was empty on a Saturday evening."}
{"text":"I've visited Carmelina's about 5 times and it's just one of those places that if you blink, you'll miss it.  It's situated in a small parking lot located beside and overshadowed by \"Taste of Japan\".  Most nights this place is dead but the food is fantastic!  You and your spouse will enjoy an uninterrupted meal here that will allow you to experience some of the best seafood uptown.  Though on the pricier side, I really love this place.  To be correct, this is more Mediterranean than Italian but give it a chance and you'll be surprised!"}
{"text":"I've driven past this restaurant hundreds of times and even used to frequent the sushi place next door but never patronized them until a few weeks ago for my mothers birthday. I tend to take my parents to the Octagon for their birthdays, but this time wanted to try something new.   To be honest i was Not really impressed. I Expected a lot more from the reviews I've read or heard from other people, not to mention the not-so-cheap price point. The decor was nice, My steak was overcooked, my dad's carmelina chicken was partially raw, the service was meh, the live music was nice but a little loud. Not to mention I ordered a wine, which ended up not being available so they offered me a more expensive wine instead but said they'd charge the same price. Im so glad I double checked my bill, as they tried to charge me the original higher price of the replacement wine. Not sure if it was an oversight or not, but it irked me a little.   I think I'll spend a little more money and stick with the Octagon for future special occasions. It's \"tried, tested and true\".  Unfortunately I doubt I'll visit this establishment again."}
{"text":"Classy Mediterranean & Italian restaurant. I went for lunch with my colleagues at work and the food was magnificent and delicious. The atmosphere and decoration inside is beautiful. The chairs are very comfortable as well. Now to the food...i started off with the bread with olive oil and balsamic vinegar which was tasty. I then had their fantastic bruschetta bread. I ordered the Chicken Parmigiana with pasta and omg it was the best I ever had. Big piece of breaded chicken and good portion of penne pasta with tomato sauce. I loved every bite of it. It was fresh, filling and authentic Italian. Great experience for a gather or date. I highly recommend this restaurant."}
{"text":"I've been wanting to try a nice Italian restaurant around the area for a while now and decided to give this one a shot despite the not so flattering reviews.   I came in for lunch with a colleague and was seated immediately. The ambiance was pleasant. The decor although a little over done added character. The servers were very professional, even the table cloths were fancy!   We received a variety of bread with mini packets of butter. Bread didn't seem fresh and it would've been nicer to have an actual stick of warm butter or olive oil. It would compliment the image they are going for of an upscale Italian restaurant.  I ordered the pasta con pollo which comes with a wide variety of pasta styles to choose from. I was recommended fusilli (long curly pasta). It took maybe 15 mins before we were served. The chicken was flavorful, but a tad rubbery. The olive oil and pasta sauce complimented each other, loved the sprig of thyme. The pasta itself was flavorful and al dente.   The actual menu is a little pricey which is expected for the type of restaurant they want to be. I ordered from the express menu and it cost $15 plus tax and tip.   Overall, I plan to come again and perhaps try the chicken florentine or halibut and shrimp with a tiramisu dessert."}
{"text":"Food was delectable :) Just make sure you clarify when making custom orders. Had the lobster.... Must try, the sauce was creamy and buttery. Nice quiet restaurant to bring you date."}
{"text":"Great food and one of the hidden gems in Markham.  They have certainly revamped the exterior (no more fake coconut tree on the outside).  I like their mixed grill - good portion and meat was cooked to perfection!  Definitely my go-to place for greek/italian food in Markham!"}
{"text":"One of the most challenging things to find in Markham is a decent, erm... non-Asian restaurant. Markham/Scarborough area has always been the go-to destination for all things delicious when it comes to Asian food, but on those days when you just want a heaping plate of gourmet pasta or a hearty steak, come to Carmelina's.  This place has a patio in the front and is quite nicely decorated on the inside. Despite the fact that the place was quite empty on a weekday evening, the food (and service) were outstanding. Hearty morsels of seafood on homemade (tasting?) pasta, hot bread out of the oven, and the vegetarian at our table had no problem finding a dish. When one of our party's steak came out a bit overdone, the waiter hurriedly replaced it with one that was just right.  Despite being ridiculously full post-entree, we couldn't resist the housemade tiramisu.   Worth it."}
{"text":"When you walk in the restaurant, the pillars, the curtain, the atmosphere makes you feel like you are already in Europe.   You can order a la carte or there is a fixed price menu $35 dinner.    Appetizer - Both the Bruschetta and the hot squash soup are as good as expected.   Entrée  - Linguini seafood, with fresh fish ,mussels, shrimps, scallops, calamari in a saffron tomato sauce is full of seafood flavor.   - The 8 oz Angus steak in a wild mushroom natural jus sauce served with roasted potatoes and vegetables is very disappointed.  The texture of the steak is the worst I have ever tried.  Not only is it not close to the name of Angus, it has a lot of fats and vessels.  This is not only my dish but 3 other dishes are the same like that.   - Risotto funghi, Arborio rice simmered with mixed mushrooms, onions, garlic and porcini broth served with grana padano parmigiano ,grilled portobello mushroom and parsley truffle oil is above average but is not perfect.  There are other restaurants that can do better.  Dessert - The House Tiramisu topped with chocolate sauce doesn't look like Tiramisu I have in the past.  It is a Tiramisu paste though it tastes better than its look  Overall, it is a bit disappointed.  The décor is far more superior that the food."}
{"text":"I have to say this restaurant has an absolutely beautiful atmosphere. Their seafood are great with pasta, especially the sauce!"}
{"text":"I was a little bit deterred from trying this restaurant because it looked pretty boring from the outside, but there was nothing else open so we went. I was pleasantly surprised and maybe it's because I had low expectations, but I loved this restaurant. The decor on the inside is gorgeous, the wall decorations resembled ancient Mesopotamian wall art and with the candle-like lighting, it gave the restaurant a historical look and warm ambience. I also liked how they had a large entrance with the doors out of the way and velvet curtains pinned to the sides to give the effect of an ancient doorway. The food was excellent. I ordered from the price fix menu and got soup, chicken, and tiramisu. The bread at the beginning was warm, which makes a hug difference in my opinion and it was definitely one of the better restaurant starter breads that I've tried. The soup was a thick butternut squash soup and was delicious with the freshly-ground black pepper the waitress offered. The chicken I ordered was covered in cheese and sauce and you really can't go wrong with anything covered in cheese, it was also delicious. And finally the tiramisu at the end was, as everything else, great - a little heavy, but better than most other tiramisus I've tried. The service was very good, the waitress was very patient with my indecisive family, even after we broke a glass haha (whoops :$) and complained that the draft from outside was making us cold (as I mentioned, the doors were kept open, which, aesthetically, was great, but it did get slightly chilly that night). I definitely intend to come back and would recommend this restaurant to anyone."}
{"text":"This has become one of my favourite restaurants in the area. Foods are above average and service is excellent. I had dinners with family on an early Friday night. We ordered their special and from menu. Our server and manager came to ask if they lived up to our expectations. I thought it was a little too spicy and she actually talked to the chef and tried to help. They had live music with piano and guitar, which was a pleaant surprise. The decor is a little old, but the overall ambience is quite pleasing & comfortable. We had a good time and will come back with our friends."}
{"text":"This was my second time here and the food is typical for an Italian restaurant from appetizers, salads, pizzas to pastas and risotto. Went to celebrate two friends August birthdays for lunch and it was pretty busy so it was a good thing that we made reservations. I ordered the steak salad from their express lunch menu and it was cooked perfectly mediun rare with cherry tomatoes, cheese, caramelized onion, roasted red pepper on a bed of mix greens with honey balsamic dressing. For the birthday ladies, they gave a complimentary duo slice of carrot and chocolate cake.   The first time I visited here with coworkers for a Friday dinner and there was a gentlemen serenading guests by singing with his guitar and then with the piano.   There is also a patio area but we sat inside. The decor adorned with inspirations from Italy."}
{"text":"Great spot out in Markham that actually gives you a very European feel with its décor and atmosphere.  Service is also very friendly with servers that know the menu very well.  I'm guessing the server we had has been there for eons.  We originally ordered a label of red wine but he suggested to spend just a little more for a better label.  Not a big drinker but the wine we had (sorry, can't remember which) was very good.  Definitely a place I'd recommend if you're looking for something a little more than just casual especially on a special occasion.  We went on a weeknight so the place wasn't busy at all.  May have to book a table on the weekends, though.   [Appetizers] Crispy Calamari - Nothing out of the ordinary with this, though you do get a good serving that can be shared.  4/5.  Bruschetta - Also a good serving size that can be shared with up to 4-5 people.  Had a really nice crunch to it and a generous amount of toppings. 5/5.  Grilled Portobello Mushroom - A must try if you love mushrooms and/or goat cheese.  Definitely a must try for vegetarians.  I'm a huge fan of both mushrooms and goat cheese so I absolutely enjoyed this salad which I had as a main. 5/5."}
{"text":"The portion and quality of food totally worth the price. We had the Grilled Chicken and Romantini pizza, so delicious."}
{"text":"Came here to celebrate our wedding anniversary. Loved it so much, we are contemplating to celebrate it here yearly. I wouldn't categorize this restaurant as casual, because most of the customers arrived in formal attire. The décor is, interesting. A fusion of middle eastern and Roman art/statues with a few nostalgic pieces here and there. The place is small enough to create a quaint setting. The waiters are out of this world, with positive attitude, attentiveness and a general comradery amongst each other. The musician played classic ballads ranging in decades. The food was OKAY (but not out of this world). We also appreciated the quiet table they sat us at, when we told them we were celebrating. BRAVO!"}
{"text":"Been coming here for years. The service, staff and food ks amazing. They are very flexible and easy to work with when hosting big parties!"}
{"text":"I like this place and the free parking.  They make you feel welcome.  Food isn't as great as I find the menu quite interesting but I find the food not as good as I hoped for from the menu descriptions.  Prices reasonable.  They have a price fixed menu with is quite good, but they don't show you it unless you ask.  Open for lunch.  Some nights they have a piano/guitar player which is nice if you're with a person you don't want to talk to."}
{"text":"Yay, I'm a fan totally describes this place. Fresh, homemade Italian food that is to die for. Our table shared some appetizers to start and then I ate what is possibly the best Cesar salad I've ever had. I followed that with the gnocchi with cream sauce and was NOT disappointed. Had no room for dessert, but would certainly be a place I'd visit again!"}
{"text":"Disappointed overpriced lousy service food lacked seasoning or any creativity can get better Italian food from the grocery store freezer"}
{"text":"Came here on a Friday wasn't too busy at all, only 2 servers so service is slow took about 2 hours to get dinner which wasn't so bad because of appetizers but kids were getting tired and falling asleep. It's on the expensive side 4 adults 2 non drinkers and 3 kids under 6 total costing a little over $360.. portions are on the smaller side surf and turf is more of a steak meal as u only get 1 piece of shrimp for seafood.. the chicken kabob meal had to be recooked as the chicken was still bloody"}
{"text":"Amazing food as well as very big portions. This was my first time and I did enjoy the experience, however service did lack. My water was done from the beginning of the meal and was not given a refill or even asked if anything was needed."}
{"text":"We were there on the Saturday before Father's Day, it was our first time there.  We had chosen from the preselected dinner set menu.  For appetizers we had fried calamari and cream of mushroom soup.  The soup was mediocre since I expected a creamy soup yet this soup was watery.  The calamari was fried nicely, crispy on the outside and soft on the inside.  For entrees we had seafood pasta, veal, salmon and scallop and chicken.  The pasta entree was really good! Adequate amount of seafood (jumbo prawns, scallops, crab meat and lobster) with primavera sauce.  The veal was over powered by the wine sauce and cannot taste the sweetness of the meat.  The salmon was cooked nicely.  It was grilled then simmered so that the salmon was tender and still kept the original flavor of the fish.  The scallop was seared nicely.  It was bouncy in texture yet flavorful.  The chicken was kind of dry i think, but the sauce was flavorful.  Overall I would recommend the pasta.  For dessert we all had tarramisu The atmosphere of the restaurant is very nice, there is a soloist that goes around the table to sing.  Dinning in a classy restaurant, we also need to pay a higher price.  Just to give you an idea, the pasta entrees range in $22-$26. I would recommend this place for special occasions but not for leisure."}
{"text":"I was pleasantly surprised at how much I liked it. Came here for a company lunch.  Atmosphere was nice and the staff were friendly. Ordered the braised short rib risotto and a seafood pasta I no longer see on the menu to split between a coworker and I. The risotto was cooked well and the short ribs were so tender! The pasta was also very tasty and noodles were al dente. The place got busy as we ate so it seems they have a pretty busy lunch period. Would come back to try other items on the menu!"}
{"text":"I usually don't eat Italian food because I am still getting used to pasta but the food here  won me over.  I would go here again if I had the urge for some pasta.  I had the Linguini Frutti Di Mare  (the linguini was whole wheat) and could smell the fresh basil in my Linguini."}
{"text":"Really a \"Meh!\" experience here, bordering bad.  As you walk in, the atmosphere is quite nice, even though I feel it tries too hard to blend the \"Persian Empire\" theme with the \"Roman Empire\" theme but I suppose it's kind of cute to some folks. Floors, bar area and tables are all very clean and kept in pristine condition though so props to the restaurant for this, which is extremely important.  Moving on to service, unfortunately things went downhill from the get go. Our waiter, who seemed to hold some degree of management over at least a couple of other staff, seemed very relaxed, perhaps a little too relaxed! I'm pretty sure this guy has never had professional and proper training for waiting tables. It's all the small things that you notice, the way he puts down dishes and picks them up, handling cutlery or even how he addressed us. That would still be fine with me if he actually would come to check on us at least once during our meals but nada. Overall very unimpressed but to be honest he seemed like the worst of the wait staff as the other few seemed quite engaged with their tables and sounded much more pleasant.  On to the food, the \"Persian Empire\" strikes back again by mixing in to traditional Italian dishes. I'm not sure who told the chef here Saffron striped (Saffron water actually) white basmati rice, cooked in traditional Persian/Iranian style mixed with grilled fish makes for \"Mediterranean Cuisine\"! I love Persian/Iranian food on it's own but this mixture of stuff is bordering distastefulness. Worse, mixing \"Shish Kebob\" style meats with little flavour with (slightly undercooked) Pasta and calling it \"Authentic Italian\". Obviously there seem to be a market for this kind of cooking though judging by the fact that some other folks here seem to be in love with the dishes here, which is totally fine but my experience with the two dishes here are less than spectacular if anything. That said, the grilled fish was actually quite decent so if you're going here and like fish or seafood, stick with those dishes where possible as they seem to do a good job with them. The rest, and specially the Pastas, seem to be a haphazard mishmash of Persian food and Italian food.  And the last point for discussion: The prices! I highly suggest folks that before you go, take a good look at the menu for this restaurant and their prices. A party of 4 with just virgin beverages and conservatively ordering will be set back to approximately around $150 easily! (Pasta dishes easily in the mid $20s, although portions are generous so sharing is an option) Here is a tip: Take your money and drive in to town or at least Woodbridge and chances are you will receive far better value and perhaps \"Authentic\" experience.  At the end of the day poor service, lack luster food with no discernible taste or flavour combined with extremely inflated prices didn't really make it for us as we bid adios to this restaurant.  I'm pretty certain had this \"Italian/Mediterranean\" restaurant been located anywhere other than the Asian Food crazy Markham area, it would never make it through the month, not on these menu prices at least. However, given the location and the really clean and nice atmosphere I can understand the draw to this place for Markham residents who are sick of having Asian Food everyday, no matter how good, and would like a change of palate. So I guess it's true that more than anything in F&B business, location is the most critical factor, not the actual food."}
{"text":"Came here on a Friday night, lovely atmosphere I must say. They also had a musician who played the piano and sang until closing. The food is average. We tried the mussels and PEI crab cakes for appetizers. Crab cakes were great, the sauce complemented the dish very well. For the main I tried the chicken Carmelina, which I thought was the best dish out of all the dishes we ordered (blue crab pasta, special of the day which was shell pasta with seafood in a tomato base). Chicken was a bit dry however the creamy sauce went well with the dish. The dish also came with scallops shrimp, potatoes and broccoli. Overall, not too shabby for a close to home Italian joint!"}
{"text":"passing this place on woodbine countless times, it was about time I try this place. The heavy wooden doors with the handles makes you feel like you've entered into a rustic, renaissance Italy, with its Corinthian pillars, statues, and wall to wall decor, it sets the mood for a good Italian meal.  The wait staff were presentable, quaint, and knowledgeable with their dishes, and provided us feedback on certain entrees.  I decided to have the Mediterranean fussili pasta.  The texture, and aromatic matrimonial flavors came out in the dish.  With the mix of black olives, sun dried tomatoes, and pesto sauce with grilled chicken ,the portions were satisfying.  Overall a 4.5/5. For the dessert, I decided to have their pecan pie which was soft, tender, and sweet. the perfect balance. an overall 4.5/5 Its definitely a fancy place to take a date, and their extensive lists of wines as i saw are enjoyable, though unfortunately didn't have the opportunity to try since I had a cold and was on meds.   I found it quite a surprise with some of their prices thought.  At most bistros I have been to, their pastas were quite pricey, on avg its approx $15-18...."}
{"text":"I have been to Carmelina on several occasions, and I'm happy to say that the food & service is always maintained at a high level.  Definitely a place I would recommend for a nice casual fine dining experience to impress."}
{"text":"I found this place based on Yelp reviews and proximity to my hotel and saw that they had gnocchi. I didn't expect them to have Greco-Roman type decor and pretty awesome food, too. Service was prompt and sufficiently attentive. Would definitely come back."}
{"text":"Great food, small portions."}
{"text":"Pension Babe is on a \"not Asian food\" quest in Markham. A challenge if you're looking for good and not fast food and not chain.  Dial up Yelp. Do a category search of non Asian places in Markham. The list is pretty thin. Thinner if you live by the motto \"don' t eat anywhere Wayne or Jennifer K have given less than 4 stars\".   Carmelina came up. No Wayne or Jennifer K stamp of approval. But heck. We were driving past the place after a day of ice cream and walking along Toronto's Western more stanky beaches.   The place looks pretty scary on the outside. It looks like a night club. Inside it's done up in Italian restaurant elegance. I had the bacon fusilli pasta. PB had the fish special. We shared the fried calamari. The pasta was okay. PB had no complaints about her fish and the portion size. The calamari had really nice batter. I'd be back for that. The bread basket was this entirely inedible flat bread. Ugh.   Service was attentive and top notch. A great place to bring your parents. Not a bad romantic date place."}
{"text":"I ordered last week from Skip the Dishes. I ordered a grilled chicken salad, and an order of bruschetta. Both were absolutely delicious! Everything was fresh and crisp, and tasted so good! Chicken was cooked perfectly, and the dressing provided was delicious. Next time I want to try eating in at the restaurant. I can't wait to try more items!"}
{"text":"Came here for lunch for a work social with my coworkers and didn't know what to expect. Ive never had Italian food around Markham. It was pretty cool to see the decor they had inside the restaurant as they make it seem like you're somewhere in Italy. Water we were served was sparkling but you could get the choice of flat and the bread they gave was perfect because it had a nice crunch and was soft on the inside. I believe it was packaged though because the waitress brought it out to show the table beside us.. either way it was still good. The olive oil and the balsamic vinegar with the bread was delicious. Usually when I do have italian food, I would opt out of that combination and stick w butter.   For the entree, I ordered the grilled chicken. Im not sure what sauce they used but it was a creamy white sauce. Paired with mash potatoes and the vegatables, hands down the best grilled chicken Ive had at a restaurant. Will be taking my girlfriend here for sure!!"}
{"text":"We came here for dinner on a weeknight.  Right when we got in , the atmosphere was very friendly and quiet.  It will be the ideal place for a first date.   The waitress was kind and friendly and got is hot water to start on a chilly night. There was a bread basket with vinegar and olive oil.  Nothing to complain about here.   We got the Spaghettinii alla Francoise and Pappardelle all Verde.  Both dishes came within a reasonable time (25-30 minutes ?) But the plates were not warm like other Italian restaurants.  The food was on greasy side the the seafood was overcooked.   Word of advice: make sure the small flies can be removed from the restaurant.  It can be a deal breaker when youre eating but have to swat the small flies from your plates."}
{"text":"The food is decent, nothing special, and I'm not one to judge whether it's authentically Italian (though I'm inclined to guess that it isn't). Nonetheless, the flavours are all OK and it makes for a decent meal, albeit not quite worthy of the price point of the menu. I did enjoy the desserts however.  What really shines here is the live music, decor, ambience, and service. So if you look at it from that perspective and accept that you're paying a premium for those things, then you'll walk in with more realistic expectations."}
{"text":"Great service the most amazing seafood  and attentive staff. It was so good we made a reservation  for Saturday  before we made it to desert."}
{"text":"It was alright.  That mushroom soup for the appetizer was unbearably sparse, where be the mushroom?  I was slurping salty water.  Calamari was pretty delicious and so was the bread.  The main I tried was the seafood risotto - mussels, shrimps, scallops + salmon, calarmari in a rich saffron broth - okay, I guess this was pretty good.  Comparable to the average Italian resto, probably would've stood out to me more if we didn't stuff ourselves on the apps.  Overall, probably one of the better Italian restos in Markham"}
{"text":"Carmelinaaaaa ... isn't that a song by Matthew Good? The song, not so good; however, the restaurant is VERY good. I'm confused by the low rating from others. Maybe they went on a bad day? Maybe I went on a good day? Maybe they're referring to the song? What matters is that both the hub and I liked it very much. The restaurant is close to home, but we were skeptical to go because of some of these reviews. My in-laws tried it and recommended it (and they are very picky). So we bought a couple of WagJag coupons and decided to try it. The hub ordered a halibut, salmon and shrimp on basmati platter, and it was delicious. I had the lamb risotto and I'm still craving for more; the rice was perfectly cooked, steaming hot (as it should be), and the meat was juicy and tender. The portions were big, and I could not finish mine. For dessert we had the tiramisu and it was really good too. Some may find it pricey but you are getting a lot for your money, and although it may not look like it from outside, it's nice and fancy inside. We were even serenaded by a nice gentleman playing the guitar (no, he was not singing Carmelina). It's nice to know that we have a good Mediterranean restaurant in our city (Markham), we definitely recommend it, and we'll be returning soon."}
{"text":"I do not hand out 5 stars lightly... But this place was spectacular!! We had the bruschetta, seafood linguini and lobster bow ties, it was all great.   Service was well above average, but what really made it  was the gentleman with the velvet voice playing the guitar and piano- it made our night!  I can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"Food is okay. Ordered the spaghettini alla francoise. Portion is big. Lobster tail is a bit tough and pasta not enough sauce. We arrived 12:15 on a Monday. Food took half an hour or so. Group of 6 and we split the bill. The server missed me while going around the table with the card machine. After I called her back, I joked and asked if I get a discount for being honest (obviously not actually expecting anything). She smiled and said \"of course darling\" then keyed the wrong amount (more than my bill) on the card reader. Didn't notice it after I paid. It's less than a dollar, but still very careless on her part.  17% service charge included on the bill."}
{"text":"It is amusing to read the reviews here explaining how Carmelina has a European atmosphere and décor. We walked in and I could immediately see the Persian design, carvings and historic replica design. As if that was not enough they served Iranian bread with butter as complimentary appetizers.  Finding non-East Asian food in the area is difficult (unless you call Tim Horton's sandwiches food and are on a suicidal bent) so we went there for lunch as a foursome and found the restaurant's Italian cuisine concentrates on pasta, risotto and meat entrees. In the last section there is fish, beef and chicken. They also offered several specials for the day.  Most food there is cooked in rose or white wine and comes with a side of salad or potato. The calamari appetizer was excellent, light, fluffy and tasty. The Carmelina Chicken with four cheeses and scallops was very good. As moist and tasty as the chicken was the scallop was extremely succulent. The pepper flavour enhanced it.  The service was efficient and attentive, but the waitress worked hard to cross-sell stuff. Want wine? Two or more appetizers? How about sparkling water? Dessert menu was promptly delivered without being asked for, etc. Poor lady must be on a quota. laughing this off, as we can fend for ourselves, I have two issues with Carmelina: one is that the food took a long time to arrive. I believe it came 30 to 40 minutes after we placed our order. This was their chance to push the appetizers and extra this and that. Do not go here on a work lunch break. Secondly, my pet peeve, they have a TV. Every time you enter a restaurant and you see a clichéd TV you do not feel like you are in a classy or quality restaurant. There is enough parking next door and the restaurant was busy, but not packed.  We enjoyed the food, but for a better experience do not sell us stuff, informing is enough, and take the stupid television off. It just does not fit among the Iranian historical characters and pillars. The Italian food was good, flavours were there and the quantity more than adequate."}
{"text":"I went to this restaurant for the first time with a group of my girlfriends just this past Saturday. I had heard that the food was very good and so we decided to go there. Well I was hugely disappointed. The food was mediocre I started with the Carpaccio which was very bland and the presentation, well let's say there wasn't one. The carpaccio lacked flavour and it was served with small shavings of parmesan cheese. I've had carpaccio at other restaurants in the city and it has always been delicious, flavourful and served with wonderful dressed greens. My entree was the Seafood alla Newburg, again bland. My scallops were cooked perfectly, the shrimp was over done, but my lobster tail was a tad too chewy. The sauce was bland, I added some chili flakes and some parmesan cheese and that helped.   The service was lacking and a bit messy at one point as they got our meals mixed up. I also think the bartender hasn't a clue as to how to mix cocktails. My friend had to send her cocktail back three times to get it right and yet it wasn't completely right! One of the servers actually tasted the cocktail from the same glass before getting a new one! Guess she didn't believe my friend when she told her it wasn't good.   The ambiance is lovely, but I was here for the food and unfortunately it was a complete let down.  I will not go back and nor any of my friends. I will also not recommend it.. One of my friends in the group who had been here twice before thinks the ownership has changed hands. She was there in the Spring and said the food and service was great."}
{"text":"Been coming to Carmelina for a few yrs now and we've always loved the atmostphere, service and food. Sometimes they will have an accordion player and you could request classic songs :)   Service has always been excellent. My bf was super tired and wanted to order a ice coffee (which they do not serve) but they made smth just for him. It was really nice of them. They are always courteous & polite.   I absolutely ADORE the Risotto Con Funghi here. It's prob. the best I've had so far. The fried calamari is also a great appetizer. Comes with a bit of salad & sauce. I duno what's in that calamari sauce but it's damn good! What I've noticed from the last few yrs is... the portion of the risotto has gotten slightly smaller. Not sure about the other dishes as I haven't ventured out of my box yet :) Will always be coming to this place. I don't know why but the place doesn't seem very busy. It's such a shame cuz this is prob. one of my favourite Italian restaurants!  Parking - shouldn't be a problem. But sometimes it does get quite busy w/ other adjacent restaurants. You can also park at Royal Bank (who works after hours?) It's super close."}
{"text":"The atmosphere was classic and quaint. The staff are friendly and informative. They make you feel welcome. Service was slow in comparison to the size of the restaurant. Food was mediocre at best. The seafood risotto was soggy however had a good portion of seafood. Wish the same could be said for the 10oz rib eye and shrimp (which came with a side of one shrimp); not worth the hefty price tag. I also had the veal chop on the bone which was very chewy. The do, however, recommend the fried calamari as it was crispy and well cooked and the sauce is delicious. Overall it was a good environment for an elegant night out."}
{"text":"Its hard to find a good non-Asian restaurant in Markham.  I was really excited to try Carmelina's, but it's SO bad.  I asked for bottled water, and the server didn't even let me know there were different sizes available.  For a place that charges $25-$50 per entree, I was given a 500ml plastic bottle of Nestle Pure Life--yeah, the ones where you can buy a whole two-four for like $2 at No Frills.  I thought it was all they had, but then I saw other tables with glass bottles of 1L Aqua Panna.  I was like wtf? Couldn't find my server anywhere for like 15 minutes, and I asked anyone I could find that worked there for the larger bottle of water.  My server came back and was like \"I'm really confused, but whatever,  what do you want to order?\"   Friend had Ragu and I had the seafood risotto.   Tried some of my friends Ragu it was just okay.  My seafood risotto was soooooo gross.  I know seafood is supposed to be fishy, but this was like an overly rotting fishy smell and taste.  It was a wet goopy mess, worst risotto I've ever had.    I don't know what we were thinking having dessert there, even after gross entrees, but we ordered the tiramisu.  Tasted like it had been sitting in the fridge for weeks.  Not smooth and creamy like tiramisu is supposed to be.  and the chocolate sauce drizzled on top was the crappy Nesquik syrup stuff, that only tastes good if you're like, five years old.  Service was non-existent, could never find our server, had to wave people down for help--and I've worked in lots of restaurants before, I know waving down is bad, but honestly we were being completely ignored.  Worse part is they charged me $3 for the crappy Nestle water and another $7 for the Aqua Panna.   Will not be returning."}
{"text":"Celebrated our anniversary at Carmelina's - great food and excellent service.  The staff have been here for 10+ years and are really caring and attentive.   On Friday's and Saturday's there is live music - they have excellent ambience and this is really a hidden gem in Markham."}
{"text":"I came on the recommendation from a hotel.  I walked in around 6pm on a Monday and it was empty.  The servers were extremely nice and knew and tasted the specials, which I could appreciate. I had the soup of the day, which was a Mushroom Purée (no dairy) and was absolutely amazing.  My entree was the Seafood Alla Newburg.  The seafood was awesome, but the veggies were under cooked. One of the poor things was that because it was so quiet, you could hear every conversation in the kitchen and the chef was not coming off as a very nice person.  He yelled at the servers on several occasions and whether or not they deserved it, it was not pleasant to hear during dinner.    It is a very nice restaurant - prices a little higher, but the ambiance better on the inside than it looks on the outside.    I would come back!"}
{"text":"I visited Carmelina this past weekend for the first time.  My husband ordered the gnocchi and I ordered the fettuccine al salmone - both were delicious.  We also really enjoyed the live music, piano and guitar playing.  Even though it was a fluke that we found this restaurant, we will be coming back again."}
{"text":"3.5 stars  I was lured to Carmelina Restaurant not by all these 4 stars Yelp reviews, but the promise of Prix Fixe on their website... Prix Fixe is just an excuse for me to have extra food instead of just a main, since I just could not resist a bargain?  How come NO prix fixe menu? The waiter that's only for group! But it is on their website!! and 2 of us is a group..?? Ended up can only order from the a la carte....  Linguine Frutti Di Mare ($18) - I have to say this is the best Seafood Linguine I had in that price range. The scallops are huge, size of a toonie and the shrimps are tiger shrimps too.  Veal Lemone ($20) - Veal is tender and the white wine lemon sauce is zesty!  I know I will be back to Carmelina again... as I know someone wants to have that Seafood Linguine again for sure!"}
{"text":"So many restaurants to choose from. But you won't miss the big sign while driving along Woodbine Avenue.  There are three restaurants when you turn into it's parking lot. Diana's Oysters, Gold Mark Chinese food and Carmelina.  Well, we settled for Carmelina. Enjoyed it a lot!"}
