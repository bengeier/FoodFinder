{"text":"Mixed reviews. I love that I can order online. I typically use a credit card and it's just easier. I will choose a place with online ordering over a place I have to call. (typically). The very first time I ordered we (my girlfriend and I) thought the pizza was amazing. Tons of cheese (I didn't order extra cheese), greasy, good seasoning & all around flavor. The cheesy bread was amazing too!   Sounds awesome right? Not so fast. Their website says 45 minutes for delivery. It took about an hour. Have ordered  from here about 7 times & only once, has it been on time. But hey, great food is worth the wait right?  Sure, if it stayed great. The second time I ordered a pepperoni pizza with extra cheese. Yum?! And some cheesy bread. OMG hope it gets delivered fast! Haha. Nope like 15 minutes late. And guess what? It was horrible. My \"extra cheese\" had less cheese that the first pizza I ordered. There was like no seasoning, and it was ice cold. The cheese bread was under cooked, lacked flavor, and had a strange aftertaste. (Never figured out what the taste was). It looked great, but it was horrible. Think most of my $20+ order went in the fridge, then to the garbage can. Ordered zucchini on one of my orders. Not sure which one, but it was a greasy mess. No seasoning, no parm, overcooked, almost completely burnt, with no flavor. Disgusting.   Back on a positive. I'm a ranch fanatic. I LOVE the HOMEMADE Ranch dressing but it is not worth 75 cents for a half filled tiny tiny ( I STRESS TINY!!!!)  cup of it. Once when I ordered the homemade ranch they sent non homemade buttermilk ranch. Was so mad being I payed for 75 cents each for 3 & they went straight in the garbage.  3rd time I ordered, I just got a pizza. Late delivery, ice cold pizza. Overcooked, not much cheese, no seasoning, no flavor. Edible, but not good.  4th time. Same as above.   5th time, same as above except the food came on time! I think even 5 minutes early, and was still hot. not much cheese, no flavor, no seasoning. Just eh.  6th & last time. Late delivery, cold pizza. Mediocre, edible, nothing to brag about.   No idea what happened but I'm very disappointed. That first time I ordered it was amazing. It still wasn't a (mineos) but it was great food. Every time since, has sucked. Seems they got rid of the garlic salt & w/e other seasonings they used.   I probably will order from here again at a last resort. They deliver to my house, I can order online, and that's about the only reasons besides hoping it will once again be like it was the first time I ordered. It will be a good while before I order though. Preferably never but we will see.  From what I see, they seemed to have had a Grand Reopening from failing before? Not sure if that's true but I don't see them surviving on the food they have been providing.   Im hungry, picked up my menus to look through for something to order & decided to leave a review. Now I'm even hungrier from the wait and will find somewhere else to order from."}
{"text":"Just got to the hotel at 1045pm and asked the front desk who delivered this late on a Sunday. He game me the menu and I ordered the chicken carbonara and side salad. Was quoted 35 minutes, and it showed up exactly when promised. Very hot and ready"}
{"text":"When we first heard and started ordering from here, it's was amazing and we swore off any other pizza place. But. The last handful of times we've ordered, our pizza comes like what is pictured - cheese slid off to one side, messy and almost entirely unsliced. I expect pizza to require napkins but, this is impossible to without having  to rebuild and repair our pizza; for that, we'd make it at home or better yet, order somewhere else.  Thanks but - for that sort of sloppy service, we'll go back to driving to Fiori's."}
{"text":"I ordered delivery to my hotel two consecutive evenings.  One night I ordered the spaghetti with meat balls and the second night I ordered the lasagna.  In both cases the portions were huge and the food was very good.  Definitely was home made.  Delivery was fast and courteous.  The next time I visit Pittsburgh I will be ordering from Bellamonte's."}
{"text":"This is my first visit...won't be my last if I pass through again! Cheesy without request...a perfect golden brown served with a house ranch! Full and happy! Could have had a few more pineapple but that's just me being greedy!"}
{"text":"The pizza is good..the crust is said to be made fresh daily.. Definitely true. It is perfect thickness.. Not to thick not to thin..cooked just right. The sauce is amazing. Sauce is the first thing I look for in a pizza. Delivery was fast and food was hot and fresh. The hot wings were not what I expected they were a smoky hot and you can see the flavor of peppers and spices. O was expecting a \"buffalo style\" hot being from NY. But they were still good. They paired well with then delicious homemade ranch. I'm pretty picky about what and where I eat so when I travel i try to stick to chains so I know what to expect. I looked up a few different places in the area and I'm glad we choose to come here. I'll be ordering again when I return to Pittsburgh!"}
{"text":"Tonight was my 3rd time as a customer since this pizza spot has been under new ownership and all I can say is it gets better every time, the pizza is exceptional and the customer service is spot on, I am totally satisfied 100%. Keep up the good work !"}
{"text":"I recently started ordering from this place about 2 weeks ago for lunch at work. I ordered 2 salads which I though were fantastic. The steak salad and the cranberry apple salad. The third time I ordered a burger and was very disappointed. The patty was thinner than a fast food joint, although it was seasoned well. I fed as though the patty needs more meat or they should charge less for the burger, or, don't sell burgers at all. I will order from here again but will stick to salads and possibly try the pizza in the future."}
{"text":"If you like wings this is the place to get them!!!  The pizza is also great.  The owner and his employees have always been nice!  I order from here at least once a week!  Best Wings in Pittsburgh!!!"}
{"text":"I'm a big fan of bellamonte pizza. It's a family run place with ample seating right on main street and the pizza is great. It's not overly American and greasy, which is great. Frankly it's expected given that the brothers who run the place are Italian. It's the definition of your \"mom and pop\" pizza place and while there is some influence from American pizza trends on Bellamonte's pizza's you and a friend (a small pizza is enough for two people or two meals easily) will be 100% satiated by the pizza. I heartily recommend the mozzarella pizza and the Hawaiian pizza."}
{"text":"Yeah, I wasn't crazy about their pizza, either. It was a typical doughy type pizza. I didn't have any of Darren's sub. The cannoli was decent. Delivery was pretty fast, though."}
{"text":"This was a shot in the dark and it paid off. The pizza was delicious, service great.  The dining area is small but I got the impression this evening most business was delivery or take out. Very, very clean."}
{"text":"My family loves the hogies at this place! We have been going here for years. Pizza is not bad either. The customer service is not good but the food is great. Just order your food to go and eat good food at home in front of your tv."}
{"text":"Yet another flyer came to my doorstep with the local Pennysaver advertising a new pizza endeavor. This evening, we ordered ourselves a \"meat classic\" pizza, an Italian hoagie, and some cannoli from Bellamonte, the latest combatant to enter the eternally raging Pittsburgh Pizza Wars.   Eh, I've had this kind of spongy, heavy, bread-like crust before along with the invisible sauce, and loads of a mozzarella/provolone blend. There was pepperoni, sausage, ham, salami, capicola, gyro meat (!), bacon, and I was bored.   The \"Supreme Italian\" hoagie was sufficiently stuffed with l-t-o, vinaigrette, cheese, hot peppers, and the usual Italian deli meats, but again, if this were a movie, I'd be yawning.   The same could be said about the cannoli.   There's just entirely too many pizzas and hoagies like this in Pittsburgh. Bellamonte doesn't stand out among the throngs.  I give 'em 6 months before the door revolves again.  P.S. According to the aforementioned flyer, Bellamonte delivers to Greentree, Sheraden, Crafton, Ingram, Mt. Washington, Downtown, North Side, South Side, Beechview, Brookline, Elliot, Dormont, Banksville, and Carnegie. $10 minimum order."}
