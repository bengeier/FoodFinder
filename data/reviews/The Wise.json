{"text":"Great breakfast choices! I was pleasantly surprised, I took a business associate here and it was very pleasant breakfast!"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I went here on a Wednesday evening and used a coupon.  The prices were very high and the food was very mediocre at best.  We ordered what looked like two very promising salads ($12.00 each), and were quite disapponted with the quality and overall taste of them.  They both advertised including goat cheese or chevre, but the amount on the salad was almost non-existent.  The beat salad boasted roasted beets, but they were served boiled.  The salads in general were small, given the price.  Presentation was perfect, but taste fell very flat. They were both over-dressed, and just seemed to be missing something, or were simply off the mark.  The spinach and arugula were old, not fresh (had to pick out some brown and rotting pieces), and in general, the salad seemed sad and not at all lively.  We also ordered the beef shoulder with horseradish sauce, onion marmalade and potoato ($17.00).  This dish was nicely presented, and while advertised as a small plate, was fairly generous.  It tasted good and seemed to be of nice quality.  This dish brought my rating from a one star up to two stars.  I was very disappointed with the salads especially, and would not go back.  The pricing of the food did not justify the quality and quantity.  However, I will give an A+ for food presentation!    To their great credit, The Wise also uses local and sustainable food from Jones Dairy Farm, RP Pasta, Stella's of Madison, Garden to be, Parisi family farms & Madison Sourdough.  Atmosphere is loud and not at all intimate."}
{"text":"Not too impressed.  Had the beef toreadors. One good the other very chewy, not as tasty.  Serving size small for cost.  While the hotel furniture was interesting, it was not very comfortable... tables too high, seats too low.  Disappointed."}
{"text":"It is pretty good looking but food is not good to me!! We ordered cheese curds, it was crispy but was not tasty; then we ordered buffalo chicken wings, it didn't taste good either. It was not fried well and buffalo sauce was wack!"}
{"text":"My friends and I decided to attend the New Orleans brunch this morning in hopes of semi reliving New Orleans experiences, awesome city btw. This brunch was trash. I could have walked back to the kitchen and prepared a better meal. Drinks took 30 min as there was no bartender and the waitress did not know how to make our drinks...  The place was empty but the room was filled with law and order mister Rogers elevator jazz. Not sure if anyone at this restaurant has ever been to the big easy, but clearly not judging by the music and food.  I'm still sitting here questioning if I'll eat again today with the over cooked rubbery Walmart barbecue turd shrimp in my belly. The best part was soaking up turd water with my French baguette jk a piece of toast!   Probably the best thing I ordered was the cheese curds, which were only half burnt and were deliciously dunked in some sort of sour cream sauce labeled as ranch. How do you mess that up? This is Wisconsin! Lol  My gf ordered the eggs Benedict, apparently the chef forgot to toast the out of the freezer English muffin, Michelin star choice. Also the poached eggs were completely boiled through, no yolk, and topped with a baby tear of hollandaise sauce, spectacular.  My favorite part was leaving and laughing.   Suggestion, fire your staff, hire real chefs, and step up your game. McDonald's has a better breakfast.  Do better"}
{"text":"Really overpriced and the food is marginal. I had some ravioli but it was very under cooked. Mentioned it to the waitress and they gave me a free glass of wine. Nice, but get it right. Saw another customer send his hamburger back two pice because it was undercooked. For the prices they charge, they should have a seasoned chef."}
{"text":"I chose this location for a dinner with very important clients from out of town.  They had a private room, which allowed for a quiet space for conversation, for a reasonable fee. The set-up was gorgeous (modern design) and group-friendly (size about 14). The server was fantastic- super polite, present without creating a uncomfortable, hovering presence, and knowledgeable about the menu and wine.  One of the best serving experiences I've ever had. He checked in with me at regular intervals to make sure we had anything we needed- including the transition from our cocktail hour to dinner.  Food was delicious, and reasonably price. Wine selection was more interesting than many other restaurants in Madison, while also keeping to a reasonable price point (by the bottle). They do have a limited number of entrees available for each entree, so unless you order in advance, some people may need to change their menu picks for dinner. For me, for this dinner, it wasn't a critical issue, especially since they advised me of this in advance.  Overall, wonderful. I plan to use them for business dinners in the future-- and return for personal occasions as well."}
{"text":"Even the bar doesn't open till 4, which is kind of ridiculous for hotel guests. I like the drinks and have had some really good apps here, too. But it is a little too laissez-faire about the convenience of guests."}
{"text":"Went to check out Tunes, Taps, and Tacos.   The music was great.  My mule was great.  A few recommendations though.   1.  Offering chips and salsa for taco night would help a lot.  Complimentary would be awesome, but at least on the menu or as an option to purchase with tacos would be a great addition.  2.  Promoting margaritas with the tacos as a special would be cool. 3.  All of the taco options were VERY spicy hot.  This is ok for some, but left our mouths burning.  Offering some less spicy options would bring variety and cater to more patrons. 4.  Bringing the check in an old book at first seems neat and different, but the books are dirty and a little odd.  This felt strange.    Overall the experience was different.   Our server was GREAT.  She was super nice, attentive and plesant.  The ambiance was clean and contemporary."}
{"text":"dg. Probably one of the worst meals ever in Madison. They were out of a lot of the entrees. The food arrived sporadically. One of the diners waited 15 minutes after the others received their entrees.  The server had to continue to apologize. Will never return."}
{"text":"Neat place but not quite on the mark. The service was poor. That's always a tough one to overcome when you're out trying to have nice night out or evaluate a place top to bottom. I ordered the wrong entree for me. Their appetizers and desserts were very good.   I'd probably eat here again to give it another chance but I wasn't over the moon."}
{"text":"Food here was included with our stay at HotelRED. It was... well... breakfast wasn't bad at all, but the kitchen was very slow.  While we had allocated the time to eat a decent breakfast, it was slow enough to make us feel like a trip to the McDonald's would've been a much, much better use of time-- and that is not something you want to say about a sit-down restaurant at a nice hotel..."}
{"text":"Dining at The Wise was disappointing. I decided to have dinner at the restaurant because I was staying at the hotel. The restaurant itself is beautiful, with a long bar, plenty tables with midcentury modern furniture, and fun lighting. However, the restaurant was empty. Now I know why.   My server was delightful, accommodating, and attentive. She checked in frequently and had a good sense of the menu. Perhaps the highlight of the evening.   Although I was dining early (6pm on a Thursday evening), four entrees were \"sold out.\" I ordered the happy hour fish tacos, which appeared to be a breaded, fried fish with a mayo based slaw. It was fine, but unimaginative. I also ordered the seasonal salad as my main course, which was a citrus salad. While the construction of the salad made sense (mixed greens, cut strawberries and oranges, goat cheese), the citrus vinaigrette was so acidic, the salad was inedible. After a few bites, my teeth and lips hurt.  Beers on tap and wine list were limited. Again, fine but not interesting."}
{"text":"I would Not recommend this place. It was nye 7:30pm. They had already ran OUT  Korbel to make their cocktail drink old fashion (on their drink menu). They did Not offer to have a diff brandy and charge the same price! They were Also out of the chocolate stout (next thing I wanted) !!!! Also they were OUT of 4 items on the menu (half of the stuff on the appetizer section ). The server was nice but very inexperience. My new York strip served in a very poor presentation. It took forever to get the bill( they were not busy at all) ! I will see if I can include a picture. I will definitely not come back!!!!!!#!now I think about it that wasn't a New York strip I had. God, not sure what they served me(Ck out the photo)."}
{"text":"A friend and I attended The Wise during Restaurant Week.  It was my friend's pick, and I admittedly had not heard of the restaurant before this.  First, I was pleasantly surprised with how easy (and FREE)  it was to park at the HotelRED on a weekday evening. The restaurant is located off the lobby and has a super modern feel to it. Everything is appropriately RED, black and white.  It's very sleek and modern - which, quite frankly is not my style.  I felt a little out of place in my cardigan and Chucks.  The table we sat at was bar height, which was fine but the chair style wasn't one that would allow one to hang a purse over it, so both my friend and I were a bit stumped as to where to put our bags.  The restaurant and bar were nearly empty at 7 pm on a weeknight.  Our server was very friendly and attentive.  We ordered cheese curds as an appetizer in addition to our three course Restaurant Week meal. I have to say - I've had a lot of cheese curds in my day, and these were just not good  The cheese tasted cheap - I can't even explain it better than that.  It wasn't like I was just underwhelmed by them, I actually didn't like them. I've always said I've never met a cheese curd I didn't like. Now I have.  I opted to try a mixed drink called \"The Dance of the Sugar Plum Fairy.\" I mean - who can resist a name like that?! I know nearly nothing about mixed drinks, so in my totally uneducated opinion, it was pretty good. ;)  My first course was a  carrot salad that included oranges, and some super good puffed rice (whose name I cannot remember).  The salad was the best part of my entire dinner. I'm not historically a salad lover, but this was incredible. The mix of ingredients worked so well together. I assumed the carrots would be raw, but they were cooked to a perfect firmness. The dressing was light and complimented the salad. And, it was visually gorgeous.  Sooo pretty.  My entree was a beet and goat cheese ravioli.  I was a bit unsure what to expect, but the actual pasta was made with beets (it was pink!) and filled with goat cheese.  Red and golden beets were included in the meal. It had good flavor, well cooked beets, decent sauce.  i definitely wasn't wowed by the pasta, but I wasn't unhappy either.  For dessert, I chose the lemon tart. It had a nice strong lemon flavor and good texture. It was a pretty tiny piece. ;)  My friend and I discussed that the meal overall was fine, but it just didn't quite seem like a $35 meal, especially when you consider that had I ordered the exact items (or similar) outside of Restaurant Week it actually would have cost less.  It feels a little wrong - come during Restaurant Week and pay MORE than you usually would?  Overall, my experience was fine. Not great. Not awful.  I don't know that I would ever choose to go back.  The atmosphere just seems wrong in Madison - like they are trying a bit too hard.  I really wish that Yelp would allow half stars - because this is definitely a 3.5 for me...however I just can't bring myself to round up this time."}
{"text":"We stayed at HotelRed this weekend and received 2 complimentary cocktails with our room (Travel Zoo deal). My husband got a beer and I had one of the best Manhattans I've had (stirred!).  They have a limited selection of whiskeys and tap beers but the ones they have are all good."}
{"text":"My husband and I had gone here during a food tour last fall. We were intrigued enough that when a coupon came up we decided it was worthwhile to try again. And, boy, are we glad that we did! First, if you are eating at the Wise, you are able to park at the HotelRed. This came in handy with all of the snow everyone and the cold making it so we didn't want to walk to fair. We started with some tea and coffee because, even though it was lunch, it was our first meal of the day and we both wanted to wake up and warm up a bit. My husband actually was really surprised at the Alterra coffee and that it was great. We started with the crab cake starter. There was a bit of lemon that gave it such a nice brightness and there was lot of crab in the three crab cakes. Perfect for a sharable lunch appetizer. The executive chef actually came out to clear plates and see how things were going. When we mentioned the lemon to him, he perked up and really seemed to enjoy the feedback. He asked if they were good enough for us to come back for and we agreed they were. I had the grilled cheese which was grilled cheese with bacon and apple jam on some delicious, crunchy, Madison Sourdough. How could you go wrong? The flavors were all so perfectly balanced and I was actually able to taste each of the ingredients. They played well together. For a side, I got the fries and smoked paprika aioli sauce. They were absolutely fine and the sauce was tasty. My husband had the Hereford beef burger with bacon and chevre. He actually thought the greens on top added a brightness to the salad-something he never thinks! He thought the tanginess of the chevre worked perfectly with the beef. He also got the fries, but opted for the wasabi aioli. It wasn't as spicy as we expected. Also, since we had the discount, we opted for a couple of cocktails to warm us up. I had the infraRED which was a raspberry vodka martini and my husband had a Moscow mule. We both liked our drinks. They were well prepared, but nothing too fair out of the ordinary. The prices were great and we'd definitely go back even without discounts. The appetizers were about $10. Each of the mains was $10-$12. The fries and dip were an extra $1.50. Maybe just one of us would order them next time and share. However, I can definitely say there will be a next time!"}
{"text":"Dear Hotel Red guests,  Welcome to Madison! We're glad to have you here. We entreat you to visit and enjoy our vast multitude of bars and restaurants, where you can usually find local brews, meats, and cheeses. Really, go anywhere. Anywhere other than The Wise.  If you must go there, do not order the \"popped ravioli\". I'm almost positive it's actually just lasagna noodles stirred in Chef Boyardi sauce. And don't order the bland red spread. And don't get a drink off the cocktail menu without first making sure they actually have all the ingredients to make it.  Enjoy your stay! I hear the hotel is really nice.  Sincerely, Adam"}
{"text":"I go out for weekday breakfast pretty darn frequently, and this is currently at the very top of my list. I love this place for breakfast. I have not been here for any other meal, and would normally want to try it based on my breakfast experience. However, reading other people's reviews is not encouraging. I also don't think I'd want to stop by during weekend brunch if it's busy.  Not very busy in the morning on a weekday, at least during the winter, which is nice. I agree with some other Yelpers that there is no clear greeting and nobody assists you when you walk in looking totally confused as it if/when/where you can sit down... even when they SEE YOU. The service I've had each time I go there has been fine - nobody memorable but they take my order and deliver the food. It's not exceedingly quick but not terrible. This being said, every time I've been there me and my twosome are the ONLY people there, so I do fear service quality if it is actually busy.   The eggs are truly scrambled (not folded like an omelette), the potatoes are delicious but not greasy, and there's a full bar. Nice space, too, and when the weather warms up the outdoor patio looks great! If you need to park you can do so for free under the hotel (again this assumes availability during very non-peak times), but it is a very odd and convoluted route to get up to the restaurant. How someone didn't think of a plan that didn't require you to walk up the ramp where cars enter the garage and circle back to some door is beyond me, and a simple elevator or stairwell could easily fix this, but that certainly isn't stopping me. It's also wheelchair accessible and there is some disabled parking on the top surface level.  Despite all of the negatives I've given, it doesn't create a problem when you're the only one in the restaurant, and I always get the same two plates and I think they're the absolute best. So, for my (admittedly limited) purposes, this is worth every star."}
{"text":"The Wise Restaurant & bar sits inside HotelRED,  Delicious food can be served right from your comfortable bed,  LFC Madison are welcome on every match day,  To watch our beloved Liverpool play,  You'll Never Walk Alone they happily said."}
{"text":"Stayed at the hotel red for 2 nights for a meeting. This was not a great experience for food.  1.  Tables and chairs made me feel like I needed a booster seat. It made eating very uncomfortable. Next times I sat at the bar height tables. Was better, but I would rather eat with my feet on the ground.  2.  Breakfast was good. However, in the book in the room it said they open at 630. They don't, they open at 7. I did get free coffee while I waited. First day I had this awesome ginger-apple french toast. Second best french toast I have ever had. It was definitely worth having. Second day, I had this oatmeal with cherry puree. It was good. Not something I would go out of my way to have again. Had some plain breakfast fare on the menu.   3. I would seek out somewhere else for dinner. I'm not a huge fan of the 'small plate' type of cuisine. First night I tried some short ribs. They were okay, not awesome and way over priced, even for this sort of establishment. I got about 2 bites of meat that wasn't fat laden. The tiny potatoes were not even 2 mouthfuls. Second night, had this duck comfit sliders. Better. They were worth ordering but not worth going out of my way for. Sometimes, you just want something simple. There was nothing simple on the menu, except for kids. Add a burger or a simple sandwich for the guests who just want simple.  4. I don't drink so cannot review anything related to that.   5. They have deserts but don't have them on the menu. No clue why."}
{"text":"Went here for restaurant week. Right away the host was very welcoming and talkative. The bartender was helpful in picking a drink. The food was so good. Loved the olive oil cake and the  spread that came with the bread. At the end the chef even came out to talk with us about the food and the hotel. Never again I'm I going to think that eating at a hotel restaurant is weird."}
{"text":"This place has great ambiance. If you are looking for a date place, check out the interior of the Wise.  It is well lit but cozy.  This is a restaurant in a hotel but no need to be a guest at the hotel to try out this place.  The outdoor patio of the wise is covered from the fun and makes a nice time for a Badgers game.  On a regular day, I would not recommend it because the noise from the street is annoying while you eat.    The food is great.  I have only tried a few things on the menu but I appreciate their take on food.  I like to have a cocktail and a few small appetizers when I am there.  The Wise  can be an early cocktail place, a late cocktail place or a dinner place.    The service staff is great and very friendly."}
{"text":"Warning: Food and drink supplies are LIMITED.  Have wanted to try this hotel restaurant near the UW Stadium for years. Finally went on a Monday night. While we were surprised about how expensive the menu was we decided to try it anyway. Things went wrong when ordering drinks.....of the 4 drinks ordered, they were out of the rose wine and the spotted cow beer. Then we proceeded to dinner.....the two couples ordered wedge salads with blu cheese and French dressing on the side.....they were out of French dressing.  One of our group ordered the vegetable tart.....out comes the poor server with the chef...they don't have the tart. The chef was wonderful and offered to make an alternative veggie dish at no cost and brought us two free desserts.   The food that we were able to get was very good, the burger, fish tacos and flatbread, but, we won't be back. Being out of 4 ordered items was a disappointment."}
{"text":"I've stopped in a few times for drinks (but never dinner).  If in the area, it works.  Bartenders are attentive and there are a few different areas to sit once drinks are in hand.  It wouldn't be a destination location however as I don't really think it has a particular identity."}
{"text":"Tried them for Brunch this morning after a long absence. Poor choice on my part. Bloody Mary ($10!) served without any garnish. Beer chase unavailable because taps were not working. The single server offered a bottle of beer instead, but couldn't unlock the cooler. The mushroom scrambled eggs were adequate,  nice fruit cup and salad but the dry toast was cold. Butter and jam apparently only available on request?  Not going to give them another chance."}
{"text":"Had lunch there today - it was delicious. The spinach, arugula, and goat cheese salad was a little light on arugula and a little heavy on candied walnuts - but really good - almost a dessert. The fries were salt and peppered to perfection. The grilled cheese was probably the best I've ever had. Decadent.  A-frame Amber on tap is great. I'd like to see a few more micro taps - everything else was pretty typical: spotted cow, hopalicious, and some others. My wife had the pulled pork and gave it a thumbs-down - she said it might be a style thing though - she was expecting bbq'ed pork... A bit pricey at $40 + tip for lunch for 2, but impressively good. I'll be back."}
{"text":"If The Wise keeps Drag Queen Bingo going, I'll be a monthly customer!   The Wise is located in the lobby of HotelRED and is a cute space with open shelving, a nice bar, and plenty of windows looking out onto Regent Street and their outdoor patio. When the wise is full for an event, seating spills out into the lobby where there are some comfy couch and chair combinations and a fireplace.   I've taken advantage of their $5 happy hour menu and had a well-poured whiskey seven, some tasty fried pickles, and loaded fries that are definitely terrible for you but are worth the splurge. I've heard great things from other people in my party about the fish tacos and the pulled pork sliders.   On one visit to The Wise I wasn't feeling so hot so I got a can of ginger beer - $2.11 with tax. I tried to pay with a five and the correct coinage, but was told \"[they] don't do change.\" My server brought me back $3 so I came out ahead, but I found that strange.   Speaking of servers, they are hit or miss. I've had one that looked perturbed with every order and kept leaving the table after only taking one or two people's order of our eight-person group to one of the better servers I've had in Madison who was super proactive about making sure everyone had what they needed and checking in on food orders frequently (the kitchen was slammed with over a hundred people at once, not the norm for a hotel restaurant).   The apps I've tried have been good enough to intrigue me to come back to try the regular menu, and as I mentioned at the top, if they keep Drag Queen Bingo on the calendar I'll be a regular!"}
{"text":"We had a group of 12 (split between 2 adjacent tables)  that dined here on New Year's Eve.  They have a sleek, modern ambiance and the chairs are really comfy, though they don't look like they would be at all. They had a special 3 course menu at $42.00 a person for the occasion that did not include tax or gratuity.  We each got to choose an appetizer, entre, and desert.  I ordered the butternut squash and parsnip puree soup (exactly what I expected), pheasant with fig and pear glaze and cabbage and apple slaw (amazing) and truffle torte (SUPER rich, but tasty).  My husband had the crab cakes (enough good things can't be said about these.  Holy cow -- the greatest I've had in the Midwest), milk stout braised beef short ribs (my husband liked these but I don't eat red meat so I didn't sample), and the evoo cake (really good and light).  Our server was great and very patient with people coming to our table mid-meal for a drink and then taking off to head downtown for a bit.  We received complimentary champagne during our meal and had a few mixed drinks that were pretty good!  We had a really great dining experience here.  My only complaint:  the gratuity that was not included turned out to be a mandatory 21%.  I've never seen included gratuity that high.  Our waitress was great and she earned it, but I think charging over 20% is a bit tacky."}
{"text":"Had drinks there twice this week! The bartender Matt makes the best Cosmo ever! Made with fresh lime juice! If you go there tell them you want the Carolina Cosmo! Tell Kim that Becky sent you!"}
{"text":"Too long/didn't read: DON'T EAT HERE!  It took 30 minutes for us to get to order entrees for brunch. It took another 30 to get our food. When it arrived, our waitress knocked my girlfriend's water all over her lap and phone. It was wild. The food was also wild. I ordered eggs Benedict (my favorite) but it came without the promised fruit and was soggy and room temp. My girlfriend ordered BBQ shrimp, but they looked so bad and tasted the same. I don't have pictures, but trust me when I say the appearance of her meal made us laugh hysterically. They were clearly understaffed.   Biggest question: why have a bad New Orleans style restaurant right next to \"New Orleans Take Out\"? It's like opening a bad breakfast place next to Mickie's (which also describes what the Wise has done)."}
{"text":"I ate here for the first time yesterday (been there for drinks before though). I was pleasantly surprised. The options were somewhat limited but each item we tried had a unique spin on traditional food. I think it is somewhat expensive for the portion size, but I suppose that is expected for hotel dining. They also use high quality and local ingredients.   Also, the drinks I saw them make were precisely measured and looked WEAK... no Plaza Tavern pours here!   We used the yelp offer which made it much more reasonable. I would go back if I had another special offer, but not for cocktails."}
{"text":"I was lucky to attend a mixer at The Wise! I really enjoyed the drinks and appetizers we shared. The decor is modern and open. Added bonus is the parking situation. Parking can make a HUGE difference about whether or not I will visit an establishment. The service was good too. I will be back again soon to check out the other food offerings."}
{"text":"Whelp.  That didn't go well.   I've been to the Wise several times before and I know folks will give me a hard time for not writing about the more positive experiences I've had there. But in truth, the service, cocktails and food have never really blown me away, and now tonight (after probably the worst experience I've had there) I feel like it's time I come clean Madison.   I've never understood the greeting/seating situation. I understand it's a hotel lobby restaurant, informal in nature, but we stood for about 5 minutes tonight watching staffers pass us by before a bartender finally greeted us and told us to take a seat anywhere. In my opinion 5 minutes is 5 minutes too long to wait to acknowledge people who are about to spend money at your establishment.   It got worse.   Apparently they ran out of grapefruit juice and instead of asking the person I was dining with whether or not he wanted something else to drink as they couldn't make the cocktail he requested, they simply substituted cranberry juice. I don't feel like I need to expand but DO feel like anytime I run out of anything while cooking or preparing a libation, I will forever just add cranberry juice.   The red spread which I've had multiple times lacked flavor. Like... any flavor. It tasted like cold red paste. Not salty paste that you ate when you were a kid. Flavorless paste.   The meatloaf slider was ok, probably the highlight of our night, but the evening was so dismal that this highlight was more of a fading flicker.   The \"popped ravioli\" is where we lost it and felt cheated out of any sort of decent experience, cheated out of $14. I didn't really understand the dish as written on the menu. What arrived was a weird cross between a lasagna noodle and papardelle. Apparently \"popped\" ravioli means ravioli that hasn't been cut, squared, filled, folded... anything really. It's pasta with the insides that act more like a sauce than a filling. This dish would be better called \"lazy man's ravioli,\" or just \"pasta and sauce\" than popped ravioli which sounds mildly interesting. Do I sound crabby? I am. Am I being fair? I am. Because this like the red spread lacked any sort of flavor. The dish was supposed to have fire roasted eggplant and garlic and I only know that because I just looked at the menu online. You'd have no idea otherwise. The pasta dough needs to be rolled out flatter before it's cut, the noodles need more salt in the water, the sauce slash filling slash stuff that popped out needs anything... like vegetables, spice, cream, chicken broth... something, and the entire dish needs an anchor. It was disappointing and insanely priced given the fact that it doesn't have a protein.    The most redeeming part of the evening was our server who admittedly wasn't great at his job, but he was trying. More than I can say about the rest of the experience."}
{"text":"Not worth it.  Went for Sunday brunch.  Wait/bar staff mostly pre-occupied with each other.  No table silverware,  My husband had the WORST bloody mary he's ever had...tasted like the mix was bad, or they dumped something sour in it.  He had to take it back (and he never does that...it did taste bad.)  Everything was half-ass:  online menu is not the same as what they actually have, most of us didn't get drink menus, food was lackluster and took FOREVER, our server forgot to bring us requested water, any spoons for oatmeal, salt and pepper, anything (butter? jam?) to put on our dry toast.  Really disappointing, especially for the prices charged.  Next time, Mickies Dairy Bar.  Maybe it's okay for sitting at the bar, but would not pay to eat there.  Ever again."}
{"text":"I could write an ode to the cocktail menu at the Wise.  All of their drinks are very creative & every single one I've tried has been amazing! Go soon & try the Cool Mule off of their summer menu (or the original Moscow Mule if you're not into cucumber in your drinks). They have amazing flavor!  Also, the frittes are hard to beat. Our favorite dipping sauce is the basil mayo.  They have happy hour on week days with some decent drink & appetizer specials. HIGHLY recommended!"}
{"text":"I made reservations at The Wise months in advance for \"dinner\" at 3PM for 12 for our daughter graduating from UW Madison on May 11, 2018. I called May 10 to let the restaurant know there would only be 10 for \"dinner\" and to make sure we were all good with our reservation. I could tell they were busy as it was graduation weekend, but was assured all was in order. We arrived at 2:30 the day of our reservation and were told there was no record of a reservation. We moved tables together ourselves and one of the staff said to me\"If you would have waited till 3PM when your actual reservation was, you could have sat at the table already set up for 10 that was currently occupied.\" I said \"Whats the difference? You couldn't find our reservation anyway!\" I thought it very rude of her to even say this! Then the server came by and removed the happy hour price list that was at every place setting and said Happy Hour drink prices didn't apply, as it was a special event, yet these were out for other customers till our arrival! I could not believe it! Then I was informed there were only appetizers available, dinner did not start till 5PM. I said we wanted dinner on both occasions I called. Why did no one simply tell me this when I called. Then a platter of cheese, fruit, and other goodies was served to a table of 3 also with a graduate,and I asked what it was and could we get that? Our server said \" No, the kitchen would kill me if I asked them for that\". So...the typical happy hour $5 drinks were $10, we had a choice of 6 appetizers, and I was deeply embarrassed as we thought we were treating our guests to a lovely gourmet meal. the worst of it was, the staff simply did not care, no apologies, nothing. I will never recommend or set foot into the Wise again. I just tried to put this review on The Wise Facebook page, and reviews were blocked. Gee, I wonder why..."}
{"text":"Good service, food was okay. It's sort of a tapas-style place, with slightly bigger portions. I'd note the beer selection is good, however."}
{"text":"We went here because downtown Madison was absolutely crazy and every other place had a wait for 2 hours. We should have known better when there wasnt one. Like previous reviewers said, we had to wait about 15 minutes to get anyone to even come to our table. This place was seat yourself but there  was no hostess there to tell you that. We ended up asking other customers to get the response. Upon looking at the menu, one person in our party ordered coffee. It took over 40 MINUTES to bring it. They claimed they were out of cups... they should have just gave it in a to go cup at a certain point. I ordered a mimosa with my breakfast. It came out with a dead nat floating in it. I wish i was making this up. Then, it took over 2 HOURS for us to get our food. I am sorry, but even if i was ordering a steak dinner it should not take that long for the food to come out. The food was decent, it was NOLA themed, but nowhere near made up for the experience. Overall, would give 0/5 stars if i could."}
{"text":"Cool  atmosphere happy hour not bad.. Fish tacos are pretty Delish will come back again. Close to stadium which is nice for game day"}
{"text":"Came here for brunch and will never again. Walked in, had to wait for 10 minutes before any staff appeared. When the one waitress did appear (it was prime brunch hour on a Saturday) she snapped \"how can I help you\" and just walked away when I asked if I could sit down. The service did not improve from there. The food was ok but cold because we had to wait 45 minutes to get it, and even then only half of it was brought out.   One person In my party had to wait an additional 15 minutes for her meal after everyone else was served, I never received my toast and another member of our group never got their bacon. We sat down at 10, by the time our server got our entire meal out and checks to us it was almost noon. I would chalk this up to a single incident of under staffing, but from what I understand this is a regular occurrence. Avoid at all costs."}
