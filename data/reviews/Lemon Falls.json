{"text":"This is a neighborhood gem.  Great for a quick breakfast or to pick up something to go (they're great with phone-in orders as well).  Wonderful for lunches and great for things to pick up for dinner.  Their food is homemade with first-class ingredients.  It's as good as it gets.  You get what you pay for and here, it's worth every penny you pay. Somehow, I love seeing the large Le Creuset pots of soup simmering on the stove.  Their Lobster Rolls are fabulous.  And everyone there is helpful and pleasant!  A win-win!  You won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"lemon falls. where to even begin. I may be biased because I was hungry at the time and was looking for the first restaurant to stop in. The chicken parmesan cutlet sandwich was absolutely amazing. The dish comes with sautéed cucumbers on the side. Highly recommend putting those on the sandwich or even eating them alone. Everything combined tasted perfect. My mom got the kale chicken caesar salad. It had a lemon dressing that tasted really well mixed in the salad. I ate half of her bowl. It's a cute restaurant that reminds me of Paris. The waitress was really nice too. My new favorite restaurant and sandwich! Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Great menu good healthy options and variety. Great food; unique/ tasty. Poor service; slow inattentive."}
{"text":"Have been here several times and everything I've had is really good to great.  Considering the quality of the food, the prices are very reasonable - they use high quality ingredients judging from what I have seen and tasted.  Small place but very nicely done bright cheery decor.  Fairly simple chalkboard menu, but there is more than meets the eye.  The grilled cheese sandwich is so much more than its name suggests.  Try it, you'll have a whole new appreciation for the namesake. The short rib sandwich is probably the best sandwich I've ever had.  Anywhere.   There is also a salad made with kale that makes you wonder why kale isn't a salad staple, it's also incredible.  And for something a bit different, the lobster roll is another favorite of mine.  Have been there for breakfast a few times, love the coffee, scones, and the wrap is something pretty special for starting the day off loving life.  It's a pretty small place and can get busy at lunch, but the staff are friendly and keep everything moving, never losing the quality focus.  Highest recommendation."}
{"text":"been to lemon falls many times for breakfast, lunch or a snack

my favorite is the short rib sandwich . . . insane!

if you have a sweet tooth - try one of the huge chocolate chip cookies from the big jar on the counter

i just had one & already want another"}
{"text":"This is such a fun place to have breakfast or lunch. They offer a unique menu and friendly service.  The bakery items are especially yummy!  The cafe is close to the falls so get a coffee and baked good and stroll down to the falls.  Lemon Falls is yet another treasure to find in Chagrin Falls."}
{"text":"I just read the recent review that a customer from Lemon Falls wrote. It seems she was upset because she couldn't get the veggie panini without cheese because she is vegan. What she fails to understand is that though the majority of their food is made to order, certain special requests, such as hers, are difficult to honor, especially at the busy lunch hour. I know this because I ordered the same veggie panini one time but without the olives, and the girl at the register explained it can't be done. She said this one sandwich is pre-made because it takes too long to make it on the spot. I had it anyways and it was delicious. Anyhow this woman who's complaining needs to understand this is not a fast food restaurant and though they try to accommodate special requests when it's busy it's hard for them to do. If it's not busy they will do their best to come through but it will take more time. 
The other thing she mentioned is that this restaurant has a sign saying they specialize in vegan dishes; I've been there many times and haven't seen it.
Long story short, for those who are looking for a vegan meal at Lemon Falls, the chopped veggie salad is delicious, and their other salads can be made as vegan choices. Also, as I recall, at least one of the soups of the day is vegan and gluten free.
I stand by my 1st review, Lemon Falls is a great addition to Chagrin Falls!"}
{"text":"My first time at this sweet little cafe.  Had a delicious egg salad sandwich and my mom had the fresh turkey. Both were very good. Portions are large and filling. Bakery looks fantastic! I would recommend this for people who like freshly made sandwiches and salads."}
{"text":"cute local spot.  love the chicken enchiladas and their brussel sprouts (not together of course).  tasty lemon poppy seed muffins too.   a bit on the expensive side.  but a great option when you are too lazy to cook."}
{"text":"Ordered carry out... Veggie panini. It was my first time eating there. The place looked clean and the staff was friendly. The veggie panini was actually really good. I also ordered salad to-go. I don't know what possessed them to put the dressing on a salad to-go, but by the time I got to eat it, it was totally soggy. :("}
{"text":"Loved this little place! Cute, good service, and great food. It's cozy yet bright, cheery and clean, with upscale counter food. Plus you can purchase goodies to take home!"}
{"text":"I have passed this place so many times and each time I muttered, \"I gotta go in there.\"  Today was the day!  Super cute place.  Mostly an order at the counter and be seated place.  Breakfast sandwiches, salads, and a few lunch items.  The stuff in the case is incredible...potato pancakes, mac and cheese, and other higher level edibles.  I ordered a latte.  It took a while to receive it but it was good, not great like a true blue coffeehouse but good.  I bought the most amazing bag of kettle corn there."}
{"text":"Went back today.  Had some really good soup!  The menu is definitely expanded from when they first opened.  Staff friendly, fast service."}
{"text":"Cute little store. Everything on offer a bit pricey though.

 Have been here a few times for takeout with most of it being decent. Best thing I've ordered was a lobster roll which had a huge helping and was fresh, seasoned perfectly and very good."}
{"text":"While Chagrin Falls has many good restaurants for lunch/dinner (with more coming this year), Lemon Falls is still the best for fresh, delicious food.  It's my go to place for lunch!"}
{"text":"Eh, I like the variety, but this place doesn't live up to  price tag on everything. I'll pay a premium for good food, but not for pretentiousness. Also old lady behind the counter was snippy. In fairness, the turkey chili was good."}
{"text":"This is such a cute, great addition to Chagrin Falls and I'm so glad that we have it. 

Equally great to dine in if you're in the mood for a salad or take home some pre cooked healthy sides for a family dinner. 

Their Vietnamese chicken salad is one of my favorite dishes.  The atmosphere is so adorable inside and if I have time to stay and eat it's a great place to grab lunch with a friend if you're in the mood for a delicious and healthier meal. They have a number of salads, sandwiches, and soups and I've like all the ones of tried so far!

Don't overlook their cute miniature grocery store which offers a lot of local or more boutique foods. And certainly the prepared food they have is great for taking home to either serve as a side or entree!"}
{"text":"The lobster roll is one of the best I have had anywhere.   The short rib sandwich is tasty as well, but I always come back for the lobster roll.  None of these sandwiches include sides however.  The salads are tasty as well.  I enjoy the Kale Caesar and the Vietnamese Shredded Chicken are my two favorites.  They also have a prepared foods case for easy meal options to go.  Definitely a highly recommended stop in Chagrin Falls."}
{"text":"My first impressions are that Lemon Falls is very cute, the food all looks good, but the attitude of the staff (owner/manager)  is HORRIBLE!  I am from out of town, just wanted a light bite to eat at the restaurant. They had some great looking things in the display case.  While I was deciding what to order, I see a plate being put together of the egglant rotini and roasted brussel sprouts. It looked good, so I decided to order the same thing. 

When I ordered at the register, I was asked if it was for here or to go. They asked if I was sitting with the other person who ordered the same plate.  I said, \"no.\"  Next thing I know they give me the food in to go containers and what should be served warm is cold.  I am dumbfounded and say that I wanted it for \"here.\"  The owner tells me he has to weigh the items, so I figure fine, it is a waste to put it in containers to weigh it, but perhaps this is their process.  When he goes to weigh the brussel sprouts, I ask for 1/2 the amount, since it seemed like a lot. He then tells me that he might as well just give them to me, since he can't weigh a small amount. I ask if he can heat up the items and put them on a plate.  He again tells me it is not part of the menu on the chalkboard. I tell him that I ordered what I ordered, because I saw a plate being put together with the same items.  

The owner/manager huffs a bit, but puts the items on a plate and warms them up.  He then goes on to tell me that they should charge a plating fee and that I only ordered $2.70 worth of food. (He gave me the brussel sprouts.)  He tells me how hard it would be to pay the $4K/month rent this way. (As a customer, this should not be my concern.)

His attitude was a real turn off. Actually, let me use stronger wording. His attitude sucks, is not customer service friendly, and is probably going to be the death of his business.  I would gladly have paid a plating fee and  would have been fine with him estimating a cost for the brussel sprouts or explaining that he can't weigh a small amount but how does $___ sound?  Who wants to try a cute little cafe  only to be affronted by a rude business owner/manager? Suggestion: Put a sign in the display case that these items are \"To Go, Only\" or that \"There is a plating fee if display case items, which are not on the menu are to be eaten at the cafe.\"

What should have been a lovely, light cafe lunch was wrecked by the owner/manager's attitude.  Lemon Falls is cute and casual, the food was good, but I doubt that I will go back to give the place another chance.

I am sure that being more accommodating to customer requests will help your business. Be grateful for every customer.  Even someone who places an inexpensive order might come back next time for a bigger purchase or refer their friends.  I was a customer service manager in the past and would like to share what customer sat managers know: A satisfied customer on average tells one or two people of their good experience. A dissatisfied customer on average will tell nine people about a negative experience. (Or worse yet, post about it on Yelp.)  Treat each customer as if they were your best customer."}
{"text":"Spontaneously stopped when I saw posting for fresh vegan soups and dishes.  Soup was fantastic and good for my low salt dietary needs too.  I did look in case for something to go with but everything has cheese except one salad so that was a bit disappointing.  There are very few places On this side of town that offer vegan options other than a salad.  THANK YOU I'll keep checking in to see what you've got."}
{"text":"Cute converted gas station is now the hot spot for breakfast and lunch! The pricey lobster roll comes with pickles for $17, but most sandwiches come in at around $8 range. Tons of beverage choices and packaged foodstuffs for sale. Tables inside fill up fast and parking is limited."}
{"text":"I give Lemon falls 4.5 Stars for food & customer service but why doesn't the website tell when they open & close?! I'm a village resident within walking distance just wanting to know when they open Saturday morning while walking my dog, he loves their homemade dog biscuits. Please update your site!"}
{"text":"I love the lobster corn chowder. It was delicious beyond measure. Some lobster soups (which are usually bisques) tend to be too thick and creamy. This soup was not thick, but had just the right amount of body; it was the perfect texture. The corn and lobster bits balanced nicely with what I thought might be whole milk, as opposed to full-throttle cream. You get what you pay for in spades at Lemon Falls--with a price tag of $8+ (dine in), one might do a double take. But it was, without a doubt, worth every penny."}
{"text":"Every bit as charming and lovely as The Rose Cafe and Charcuterie in Venice, California.  The fresh quality foods, the breezy atmosphere, and the great value make a return trip automatic,

The shrimp salad was marvelous.  Perfectly cooked shrimp, tender to bite into and not overcooked, and a light dill sauce were a perfect starter.  Imhad the lobster roll, now $16.50, which was the best I've had outside of New England and the ones I make at home.  Again, really fresh lobster meat, tender and moist, a generous portion on a grilled New England Style hot dog roll.  If it only didn't have sesame seeds....... Not part of the traditional presentation.  My friend had a big turky waldorf salad, which looked marvelous and so fresh.   Unfortunately, I felt they could use tastier turkey or even roast chicken for better flavor and texture.  We tried a Russian Biscote for dessert, similar to a large Rugula, which was to die for.  Not to sweet and perfectly baked."}
{"text":"One of my favorite local lunch spots! The soups are some of my favorite menu items, but I've never had anything less than delicious there. Make sure to get a giant chocolate cookie and a cup of coffee on your way out!"}
{"text":"This place is a super cute corner cafe with friendly staff and yummy food. Limited menu but everything sounded delicious. Came for breakfast today and got the egg sandwich with tomato, bacon and Gruyere- SO good. 

And while I didn't get anything else, I was very tempted to purchase some of the speciality goods they had for sale- think gourmet mustard, imported biscuits, and some awesome looking Easter treats."}
{"text":"They do not take American Express, which is inexcusable in this town and for the prices charged. 

Additionally, they do not offer a side salad. They offer a soup and sandwich combo but not a salad and soup combo, so you are forced to pay $11 if you want greens with your sandwich."}
{"text":"Love this place, I'm really surprised it was empty on a Saturday morning while Starbucks has a line out the door. The coffee and food here is so much better"}
{"text":"i try to come here as much as i can its so good. the lobster roll is my favorite at $14.00 but its worth it. i also love the smoothies and salads for the perfect healthy meal. i also often buy the pre made food such as mac n cheese, butternut squash au gratin, chicken salad etc. the service is lovely both of the owners are so friendly and always make me want to come back. 
p.s the peanut butter cookies are awesome!!"}
{"text":"Went here for my bday lunch. Took my dog cause their patio is dog friendly. Probably won't do that again, very tight space with 4 tables outside. Very unique and adorable little market/cafe though. Pretty decorations and I appreciated the fact that they kept with the lemon theme in decor. Staff was very friendly. 
The bakery items didn't swoon me so I had trouble choosing one, I ended up with the lemon yogurt pound cake-- little over cooked but the icing was great! My dog enjoyed a homemade dog treat - she loved it! 
The refrigerated pre made items looked great so I might try one of those if I go again, I saw a Mac and cheese block the size of your head. 
Our lunch items weren't phenomenal. We had grilled cheese, short rib sandwich, and a veggie salad. The salad dressing was to die for, fresh lemon. The sandwiches had good crunchy bread but we did not feel they were worth the hefty price tag! My short rib & cheese sandwich alone was $15 without a side  each sandwich came with a few cucumbers in a salad of sorts-none of us cared for that. Thought it to be a weird touch. 

Bottom line: This place fits into the Chagrin Falls vibe. A little too pricey for my taste but prime location, adorable decor, fresh somewhat eclectic food."}
{"text":"Refreshing tuna white bean salad nicoise, big enough for two, large personal bottle of chilied tap water was greatly appreciated on this hot summer day. Nice atmosphere and comfortable seating inside, Definitely will be back."}
{"text":"I have been to Lemon Falls a couple of times ever since I started working in the area back in January. Their vegan chili is my go to, especially in the colder months. Now, that I think about it I have never gotten anything from here that I didn't enjoy. The only real problems with Lemon Falls are the wait times and the prices. I just don't understand how it could take 35 minutes to pour a bowl of premade soup... I mean, maybe I am missing something here? All I know is any time I have ever ordered from here I have had to wait at least 25-30 minutes. It has gotten to the point where I don't really go anymore because I don't want to waster half my lunch break standing around.

The other issue is the pricing. A couple of examples: 
A bowl of granola with milk: $4.75
Shredded chicken salad: $10.75
Bowl of soup: $5.25
Iced coffee: $3.30

It just seems a little too rich for my blood, but maybe it's just me."}
{"text":"Good food any time of the day. Freshly prepared and a variety of choices to please anyone who likes good food that is presented for eating in or carry out. Nice gifts on the shelves too."}
{"text":"Cute little place.  Fresh food with great flavor.  Loved the Kale Caesar.  The baked goods are great according to my 12 year old daughter.  I've also tried a few of the soups and have never been disappointed.  I only give it 3 stars because it is pretty pricey and I have never found the staff to be particularly friendly."}
{"text":"I can only speak to the very short trip that my friend I made to pick up some beverages after a long shopping day. 

But it was only that one trip that made us immediately regret eating where we did earlier. This place is so damn cute! 

It's tiny, but mighty! Lots of teas, coffees and specialty drinks. There's a counter to order salads and sandwiches to go or to enjoy there. Plus, there are some pre-made items you can eat there or take home and warm up! I didn't try anything yet, but it all looked delicious! 

I did try the peach ginger iced tea and I was in heaven. 

I can't wait to come back and try more at this cute, little boutique-y bistro and sandwich shop!"}
{"text":"I can only speak for the nice ambiance and the strawberry lemonade. They both were great! I will have to try more at Lemon Falls located in the beautiful city of Chagrin Falls. Will write more when I try more :)"}
{"text":"I have to say I've been a bit disappointed with Lemon Falls lately.  Today I went there for lunch.  Their soup of the day was a gazpacho.  I got that along with a small container of their lobster pasta salad.  The pasta salad was a bit bland and the gazpacho was good, but nothing special.  The girl at the counter who took my order and handed me my food, never smiled and didn't seem very happy.  Both items together were over $9.

The last time I was here, the women who took my smoothy order made me the wrong one.  When I mentioned I ordered a different one, she defended herself and said I had ordered the one she made.  I ended up just taking it because I didn't want to wait any longer.

I really want to love this place, but their customer service is far from excellent."}
{"text":"This place is so cute!  My friend and I were in the Chagrin Falls are taking a knitting class.  After the class we decided to stop and grab some food.  That is how we found Lemon Falls.  

Oh my goodness the aroma of the place!!!!  I wanted to order everything off the menu.  They have vegan and gluten free options (#winning).  OH and all the sparkling water brands you can think of.  

The décor was so adorable and while we were waiting for our food, my friend and I fell in love.  They even had fresh flowers on the windowsill and patio/outdoor seating.

The food was extremely good as well. This would be a great place to have brunch/lunch."}
{"text":"Lemon Falls is an adorable little cafe!

I came here with a friend yesterday to get some work done (since they have free wifi) and a little bit to eat. I got a double espresso and a blueberry scone and my friend ordered a latte and an apple-nut bread. The coffee beans they use are locally roasted (yay for supporting local Cleveland businesses!). Both our pastries were fresh and made for tasty afternoon snacks. Even after that, my friend and I found ourselves eyeing the shelves of gourmet cookies, candy, jams, and other speciality foods around the shop! We both wanted to try everything they had to offer! Besides that, the staff is very friendly and welcoming! 

I'll definitely be back to this charming cafe soon, and next time I'll know to bring a bigger appetite!"}
{"text":"I wanted tea time snack and stopped by. I got an Everything Cookie (fresh off the oven) and Lemon Yogurt Pound Cake and they were both delicious! The price is reasonable and the portion is generous. I would definitely go back to try their other baked goods and deli food."}
{"text":"What a fabulous place for lunch! Ate outside; staff couldn't be nicer. Had a variety of meals with my family and all  were fresh & excellent!"}
{"text":"Healthy, delicious food that is quick and easy.  The Kale Caesar salad was fantastic!  The dressing is a very light lemon/parmesan olive oil mixture that lets the true flavor of the greens and chicken come through.  Tasty!  The vegan split pea soup tastes like my grandma made it, only healthier."}
{"text":"Lemon Falls is the cutest ever. Even just walking in, it feels warm and inviting. Like you're at your Aunt's cozy house in the country, and she also just happens to be a really good cook. I challenge someone to tell me there is a better café/breakfast/lunch spot in Chagrin Falls. Really, let's duel.

Lemon Falls is located right on the corner of North Main Street. The exterior has this cute, almost vintage garden vibe happening. Shortly around the corner, you'll find some metered parking which is usually free.

I LOVE this place for several reasons...

+ Atmosphere. The vibe is distinctly warm, creative, and just somewhat inspiring with a charming personality. Sit here and eat lunch with your Mom, or grab a coffee and do some work/homework.

+ Food. The lobster roll was incredible. While many places will skimp on their portions of lobster, Lemon Falls is well worth the price. Served on an open face brioche roll, you would think it was poached fresh off a coastline.

+ Gifts. From everything from teas and coffees, to handmade dog treats and antique snacks, you can find a small, \"make-you-smile\" gift in a heartbeat.

+ Patio. Lemon Falls has the sweetest bistro-style patio, where dogs are welcome.

Also, everyone who works there is just genuinely nice and welcoming. That's rare in itself. Bookmark them now! If you don't love it, call me up for that dual."}
{"text":"I just had the most amazing kale chicken Caesar salad. Get it. You won't be disappointed. So fresh and amazing dressing and juicy chicken"}
{"text":"The food here is unique, always tastes great and is like stopping by your mom's house to grab a meal.  The staff is always friendly and welcoming and there are also a lot of items to buy to make your meals at home better as well."}
{"text":"People complain that a lot of the items here are expensive, but I think they're pretty average for a healthy, fresh, filling meal. I've been here a few times, and they have great sandwiches, salads, soups, pastries, etc. I really enjoy their iced tea! Next time you're in Chagrin Falls, be sure to check this place out."}
{"text":"Cute place but it took them 20 minutes to get us our coffee, then they didn't have any creamer and it took them 15 minutes to get some. Cute but the staff killed it for me"}
{"text":"Fantastic food, ambience and service! Every time we come to Ohio to visit family we always make time to stop in for lunch. Everything is made fresh to order and is absolutely delicious! I always plan on taking photos of our food but the second it arrives at the table out only thoughts are of chowing down!!! I highly suggest ordering off the menu for dining in and then ordering a few take away items from the deli case. The desserts are to die for delicious so don't forget to get a cookie, muffin or scone! Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Came here with some Dave's Cosmic for smoothies to chow down with. Why  did it take 25 minutes to blend up two drinks I have no idea. And then they didn't even taste good... Ordered the mixed berry and tropical smoothies. The outdoor seating was dirty and trashy. Really, this was Ben & Jerry's beforehand and this experience made me miss it."}
{"text":"This. place. is. amazing.  

We've had everything from coffee to green smoothies to breakfast sandwiches to vegan tomato soup to breaded chicken breast and it's all been phenomenal.   Their prepared foods are delicious and a great option for lunch or to take home for an easy dinner.  Their baked goods (we LOVE the blueberry scones, especially when they're still warm) are all fresh and taste awesome.

This place is such a gem.  How anyone would want to frequent the Starbucks down the street when this place is so close is beyond me!"}
{"text":"OMG Lemon Falls is THE reason to visit / move to / shop in / buy a house in / visit friends, etc. in CHAGRIN FALLS! Beautiful gourmet carry out prepared food & desserts! Unique specials & the nicest folks behind the counter! Love the Brussels Sprouts & then the Huge cookies for dessert! Just wish the hours made it open later...,"}
{"text":"I always heard about Lemon Falls and constantly drive past it so after living in the chagrin Falls area for a year, my husband and I finally decided to give it a try. When you walk into this teal building on the corner, you jsntantly smile. It takes you to this place that feels like you are in this town where everyone is your friend or neighbor. The staff greeted us when we went to make our order. I had a ginger peach tea unsweetened that I drank right up where my husband had the house coffee and loved it. They have these wonderful farm style tables with metal chairs and you are surrounded by smiles, laughter, and deliciously smelling baked goods and meals. We are already saying how excited we are to go back. I highly recommend Lemon Falls for breakfast, lunch, coffee, tea, and baked goods (including homemade dog treats)!"}
{"text":"If you are looking for a quick bite to eat, Lemon Falls is a nice choice.  They offer breakfast until 11am and some warm sandwiches and salad options for lunch.

It's not a big cafe, maybe seats 16 people, but was not crowded so we were able to find a spot.  Ordered at the counter (the service attendants were just Ok, 3 stars for service).  Food was pretty darn tasty!  I ordered the veggie sandwich and my friend enjoyed the signature dish, the lobster roll.  Given the Chagrin Falls location, it was a tad pricey."}
{"text":"I don't understand the hype. I went for the \"vegan options\" and there was anything but...

I stopped in today during Blossom to get something to eat as the festival didn't lend itself to vegan food. The place is cute but that's about it. As I was reading the menu on the chalkboard, I realized there were 0 vegan options. My fiancé and I were dumbfounded. I'd like to mention we weren't greeted whatsoever upon entering and there was a line. The people in line took it upon themselves to treat the store as a day care and let their children run around all over the place so this didn't necessarily set the scene as a place I would have wanted to eat had there been vegan options as stated. 

We asked the people behind the counter what was vegan other than the carrot muffin in the container and the kid looked at us like we asked him if he had the cure for cancer. Luckily, a much more knowledgeable man told us a few things that were \"veganish\" and vegetarian. This was of no help because we came for vegan food. He was nice enough to say they could make any salad we wanted, which I appreciate, but if I wanted a salad I would have made one at home, for free. 

All in all it was quite the let down and we won't be back. We ended up having brunch at M Italian across the street, where surprisingly there were many vegan options in the event that you eliminate and sub some ingredients. 

Please do not advertise yourself as having vegan options when really there are only a few things that are. Tofu egg salad or chikn is so easy to make and would be an awesome addition to the sandwich section. Even a veggie sandwich. Let down."}
{"text":"I just left Lemon Falls after the cook refused to serve my husband egg whites. My husband has an intolerance for egg yellows. Seriously, the cook refused to separate the yellow from the white when making my husband's sandwich. We're headed down the street to Main Street Diner."}
{"text":"Love Lemon Falls! I go out of my way when in the area to come here for lunch or breakfast. Love the steamed eggs prosciutto and parmesan for breakfast. Everything on the lunch menu looks and tastes terrific. Especially like the chicken pot pie, lobster rolls and delicious soups. Great vegan and gluten free selections as well. Desserts to die for! And most ingredients are sourced locally. That's a big plus for me. But the best thing about Lemon Falls may be the staff. They make you feel like family. I don't think I've ever eaten here when owner Jim didn't come out to see how I was doing. Love Lemon Falls!"}
{"text":"We had breakfast at Lemon Falls on Saturday morning (holiday weekend), the food was good, the service was horrible.  Reviewed our order with the cashier twice and still didn't get the correct food.  We waited 20 minutes to get our food.  There was one customer (one person) that had taken the table for 6 and had parked himself there with his computer... it was obvious to everyone but him that that table was needed for more customers. So our party of six had to split up in three 2 person tables before another table became available. When our order arrives, one sandwich short, we had to wait 20 more minutes for the last sandwich to be made.  The cashier had moved to the coffee station, now someone new ringing up orders... it seemed like no one knew what their job was. Very disorganized.  Breakfast wraps and avocado toast were good, just make sure you have an hour to spend if you want to eat breakfast here."}
{"text":"Seriously, this little place produces BIG flavor. I have added some new items I've tried to list. I've finally tried the Lobster Roll and holy WOW! It's fantastic and definitely all it's cracked up to be. If I had 15 to spend on lunch every day, I would eat it every day. 

Also, the Kale Caesar salad is phenomenal. The flavors are very unique. The portion was big it was zesty and citrusy. Seriously, I'm salivating thinking about it. I would recommend any of their menu items because I have yet to go wrong. SO GOOD!!"}
{"text":"Had a nice little lunch with my mom and dog by the falls today thanks to this lovely cafe/marketplace. I had the tarragon chicken salad sandwich - so simple but really good - everything was fresh and homemade, delicious pickles on the side. Lemonade was refreshing on hot day. We also tried a blueberry scone - scones are my favorite bakery treat and these were perfect!! I even had a treat for my dog - they make peanut butter dog biscuits that have the texture of a scone - my dog loved it, ate the whole thing, and she's quite picky on treats. 

I love everything about this cafe, it's exactly what a neighborhood needs and I would come here every week for coffee/breakfast/lunch if I lived in the area. Cashier was also so pleasant and nice. Definitely recommend!"}
{"text":"Lemon Fails :( If you are vegan -- you'll be disappointed. I have tried to order the veggie panini twice without cheese. The sign says they specialize in vegan, so this should be no problem right? Wrong. The first time, they begrudgingly made it without cheese. The second time, they refused, saying the shredded cheese was pre-mixed with the veggies. So much for vegan and so much for fresh. They didn't even bother to suggest a vegan alternative. Worst service I have seen in a very long time. If you can't do customer service, don't open a business. I will never return."}
{"text":"Pricey but worth it. Often a line at lunch. All items fresh made. Coffee great too if Starbucks, nearby, not to your liking. 
Spotless eating area. 4-5 tables outside. Undeniable French cafe feel inside. 
Destination lunchtime eats to enjoy Chagrin."}
{"text":"Lots of variety! Fresh expertly prepared items!  Love this place!  Always something unique and tasty!  Treat yourself!"}
{"text":"Perfect place to grab lunch or a coffee! Space is small, but quaint and personal, just like Chagrin Falls. Would certainly recommended to an out-of-towner or resident to check this spot out!"}
