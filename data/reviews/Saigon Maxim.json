{"text":"Saigon Maxim is my new favourite for great Vietnamese! The service is excellent, the pho is extremely good, and if the packed tables at lunchtime are any indication, I'm not the only one who thinks so. While it can be a little on the noisy side at lunch, if one comes in after 1 PM, it's just fine. Kudos to the owners for saving a oft-changed space from obscurity and changing it into a great place to have good food at a decent price."}
{"text":"Pretty good restaurant. Nice ex-Ricki's interior, good and not pricy food, the service is good as well"}
{"text":"Very rich and tasty beef soup broth, high quality beef, nice and clean restaurant. 5 stars!"}
{"text":"This gem of a restaurant tucked away in Riverbend serves up excellent food with friendly efficient service.  We dropped in for lunch at 11:30 which was a great idea as the place filled up fast.  Usually when you get quantity, you don't get quality but in this case Saigon Maxim delivers both quantity and quality.  Our meals had the right amount of spices and seasoning with portions large enough for leftovers all served at a great price.   The only thing missing was seeing Grandma from the TV commercial."}
{"text":"SO GOOD! We decided to give them a try and we were not disappointed. The portion sizes are huge! Food is tasty and quality. Staff was friendly and attentive. Very good experience. We are really picky when it comes to Pho and their broth is just perfect. We will be regulars here, had enough left overs for lunch the next day."}
{"text":"I always come here with my family. The atmosphere is always nice. Staff are extremely friendly and the food is always fresh, hot and comes out fast! It gets really busy during lunch time but definitely worth the wait. The restaurant is clean and price and portions are fantastic!"}
{"text":"Delicious. My wife and I hit up Vietnamese in most of the cities we travel to, and this one was top notch. Great decor, prompt service and great value. Our entire meal including tip was less expensive than the shitty theatre snacks we had earlier in the day. A welcome addition to the Riverbend neighborhood."}
{"text":"Saigon Maxim is by far, my favorite Vietnamese in the city. Service is excellent and super fast, even when it's a full house. The restaurant itself is nice, super clean and easy to get to. Try the Curry Noodle Soup (tofu vegetable, beef, chicken or seafood) and I swear, you will have dreams about it. It's a hard dish to find and when you do find it, it's never done this well. Standard large Vietnamese portions, amazing prices and always fresh!"}
{"text":"Might have been a little harsh on the local pho hole. I guess I should've known better then to order the chefs special at a Vietnamese restaurant. Since then I haven't had a bad experience so I decided to update it.  I think I'm still bitter that my favourite place Pho Tien Giang closed.  Does anyone know any place that puts peanut chunks in there sate sauce?? Not the same without it"}
{"text":"Awesome. So awesome!   There is something magical and special about the vietnamese coffee here. It is delicious. Try it.   We started with the shrimp tempura which had a fantastic sauce with it.   My husband got the satay lobster noodle soup. Rich, dark flavorful broth and lots of lobster. Really good for under $20.  !    I got the vermicelli with shrimp, beef and chicken. Often vermicelli can be bland and bleh, but this one was so tasty! Even the bites without meat were full of flavor, and a little spicy. Really stood out from the regular bland vermicelli.   Super cute restaraunt with lots of space, and lovely servers. Will come here again.   *update* the curry seafood soup is also incredible"}
{"text":"One of the best Pho I've been to! Love it. Soup's delicious and people are very nice. And it's clean as well! Price is very reasonable so is the quantity! Highly recommend it!"}
{"text":"I come here regularly, about once per week I'd say. I drop my older son off at piano lessons, then I come here with my younger son.  The food has been been consistently good, and they're beginning to recognize me as a regular. They're quite friendly, and the service is pretty quick. I can order, receive my food, and pay the bill within 30-40 min.   I will post more pics, as soon as I try something new."}
{"text":"Super delicious, great staff, the food was hot & fresh and it's not expensive. They give you enough food to pack up some extra to take home for later or lunch tomorrow  I will definitely make the trip to come here again  :D"}
{"text":"I called in for a pickup order this afternoon, and it was ready when I arrived, about 10 minutes later.  Unfortunately I got home and it was the wrong order.  I called back, expecting to have to go back and pick it up myself again, but they said the right order will be to my house immediately.  I believe the owner came and dropped of my correct order, apologized profusely, and told me to keep the wrong order for lunch tomorrow.  I definitely appreciated the service, and I tried a bit of both orders...both dishes are delicious!  I will definitely return."}
{"text":"Dinner date with the misses, which usually means sushi. But I was in a soupy-seafood kinda mood, so it's off to Saigon Maxim.  Had a lobster dinner, aka Lobster curry soup and it was delish! I love a creamy curry broth and even though I'm so not a lobster-meat guy, I do enjoy a fishy stew and this didn't fail. My young lady had the satay lobster soup, along with my lobster tail.  Very good quality & taste and fair prices. It's worth a check-in for sure.   PS: Decent Shrimp Salad Rolls!"}
{"text":"Tried Saigon Maxim when I was in the area.  Satay Chicken sub was absolutely delicious!!.  Others had Chicken Vermicelli bowls, There was some sort of a \"Mock\" chicken type meat on the top. It looked like a chicken nugget.  I have never seen this used in this type of dish. In the past it has always been grilled chicken sliced up on this dish. Over all the experience was ok, good server, fast service."}
{"text":"Wonderful food and fantastic service! Bright, clean and a pleasant family atmosphere. The cuisine is always fresh and tasty! Large servings and we never leave feeling hungry .. sometimes we have leftovers for take away. Try #35 and #40 so delicious!"}
{"text":"Went for a Monday lunch. Quiet but 15-20 diners. Our first time here, waitress very patient answering our questions. We had the dumpling appetizers which were great. Our main courses mine a vermicelli, prawn,chicken and satay beef. This came promptly and the ingredients were fresh tasting and delicious. My lunch partner had the thin vermicelli special combo. Again arrived promptly with my meal. Again fresh ingredients. We will be back to try some of the many offerings. Extensive menu."}
{"text":"Good experience overall. Service - friendly, quick, professional. Food - #14 - House Special Beef Noodle Soup - broth was rich, with some oil on top, which is a good sign that it was stewed with meats and bones.   #23 - Satay Seafood Noodle Soup - different broth used than #14.  This is also a good sign.  Some places use the same broth for all their types of soups, which is not right.  Authentic Vietnamese restaurants know there are different broths for different types of soups.  This soup was also very good, broth was very tasty. Parking - plenty of parking, it's in a mall so parking is shared and plentiful. Interior - pretty new, clean with tables and booths.  Enjoyed my visit, but it is located in the SE and a bit far out of the way for me.  If I am in the area, I would definitely visit again and try their specialty:  Sate Lobster Tail Noodle Soup - looks really good."}
{"text":"Not much love here.  We were seated quickly in a booth in the corner. The decor is a little incongruous from a typical Vietnamese restaurant but it is pleasant enough. A guy came back quickly to take our order which was a 40 - vermicelli with chicken, prawns & beef, a 41 - vermicelli with lemongrass chicken and some tea right away. Everything went south from there.  About 5 minutes later a lady came by and dropped off some spring rolls and quickly left.  We were a little uncertain if they were a complimentary thing but since we had no napkins, utensils, sauces etc. we thought we would wait to find out. We flagged someone down and it turns out that they didn't belong to us so they were quickly removed. We requested from that server our tea as well.  Shortly after our dishes were delivered and we finally got our tea. We had to ask for napkins and either chopsticks or a fork to eat the food with as the food delivery person was scampering away.  I order lemongrass chicken vermicelli every time I go to a Vietnamese restaurant, which is fairly often,  and this order looked and tasted very different, and not in a good way. It tasted exactly like Chinese chicken chow mein, with about the same amount of grease.   My husband's bowl more closely resembled what I have come to expect the dish to look like but his vermicelli was clumped in the bottom and a few pieces of his chicken were filled with gristle.   No one had come to our table to check on us from the time the food was delivered, and after we had finished eating what we could we sat for quite some time before we just got up and went directly to the cash register to pay.  This is the standard operating procedure for more casual Vietnamese restaurants but this place appears a lot more formal so we weren't sure, but we didn't want to sit in the booth ignored any longer.   There is a 100% chance that we will not be returning. The food is sub-par and despite a whole ton of wait staff, the service is not great either. There are far too many other options in the city that are better."}
{"text":"My girlfriend and I were excited to try out this local Vietnamese restaurant. I don't think we'll be back though.  Granted the place was relatively full when we got there, but the service was just plain bad. It took a while for us to be able to order our food, then when we got it (it wasn't served by our waiter) we never saw someone again until we were ready to pay for our meal...no extra drinks for us.  Not just the service was poor though, I am a man who truly enjoys pho, but this restaurant had some of the blandest pho I've ever eaten, if I ever get dragged back here you can bet I won't be ordering the pho again!"}
{"text":"My Mom and my Auntie have been raving about this restaurant for quite awhile now. For family lunch on Saturday we took their advice and went here and I am so glad we did because it was delicious! There food options are very reasonably priced and oversized portions. I got the seafood soup and it was delicious! It had crab, shrimp squid and scallops in it. I love scallops way more than squid and they put lots of squid in and only one scallop and I wish they would have put more so that was the only negative thing about the experience. My grandpa got a lobster curry soup and his soup was the most expensive, yet it was definitely the most delicious at the trouble. However, because of the portions and how creamy it is it would have been a very heavy and very filling soup. In the soup where it states that you get lobster you get a whole lobster tail in it. It is delicious. I will definitely be going back because I saw the rice vermicelli bowls coming out and they looked amazing and oversized portions as well."}
{"text":"I have an addiction to Vietnamese Food however I am a picky eater so I only ever went  to 1 Vietnamese restaurant but since I live in Riverbend I decided to try Saigon Maxim and it's unreal. I usually call ahead of time to get it to go and they say 10 minutes and when I get there it is ready. When I do order in the food comes out super fast, the service isn't awesome but no complaints."}
{"text":"Always great food!  I have wings and my girlfriend had vermicelli bowl with spring rolls.  Both were great! The place was busy but the food came out hot and fast. The only thing here is the staff is running around like crazy people trying to serve everyone and it's distracting plus when they clear a table they are smashing dishes and making a racket!  But the food is so good here this is just part of the experience. Great Vietnamese food, best in the south if you ask me!  We come here often and will continue to come!  Love it!"}
{"text":"It was pretty good. Not too bad at all. Got sate soup and its actually peanut-ty sate which i actually like"}
{"text":"Friendly service. Bright clean decor. Offers noodle soups, dry noodles, rice dishes, even Viet subs. Good portions, good taste."}
{"text":"By the way, don't try to find a place on Google by searching \"Calgary\" plus \"Saigon\", because apparently there are nineteen restaurants in Calgary with \"Saigon\" in the name.  NINETEEN.    Obviously Maxim must be the best, why else would they call it Maxim.  Being a Vietnamese restaurant, one should expect common qualities.  The food should be good; the service should be...well...appalling.  I wonder if there's a correlation between bad service and good food--the further apart they are, the better.  So if one is treated like absolute garbage, the food should be next to ambrosia.  This is not far from the truth with Saigon Maxim.     Saigon Maxim is not particularly memorable visually, with elevated sections, poles, and a labyrinthine layout one must navigate to even find the bathroom, a task made even more difficult given the crowds.  The place was slammed this afternoon, and after a short wait, we were led to our seats.  Knowing full well how successful a restaurant is when turning tables efficiently, the staff basically took that as gospel, encouraging patrons to order quickly and depart as hastily, rushed and rude service prompting a lower tip being favorable given the reward of higher table rotation.    An example of this was shortly after being offered menus.  I had previously decided to avoid the usual pho like my friend was planning on ordering and tackle something different.  I soon fell upon the combo thin vermicelli patties--served with salad ride paper, peanut and house special sauce.  It looked interesting, but when I attempted to inquire about it, the waitress responded, \"you have to roll it; I don't think you can do it.\"    Okay.  Outside of accusing outright prejudice, the probable reason would be that it's a long meal to prepare and devour, and the restaurant wants to turn tables quickly.  Pho and its related dishes are already prepped and ready for assembly.  So whatever, I opted for the vermicelli bowl, which is basically a pho with no broth and more stuff, though served in the same bowl.  We both also ordered egg rolls and shrimp salad rolls, the latter always being my test of any Vietnamese restaurant.  And when I claim the pho and its related dishes are prepped ahead, I mean to such an extent that the delivery of food after placing said order took less than three minutes.  After ordering, I took in the bathroom, and when I returned, the rolls were waiting.  Only a few minutes after that, still with our plates half full (or is that half empty?), our mains arrived.  Who needs burger joints when Vietnamese dishes arrive this fast?  Any faster and they would read our thoughts, or simply and more accurately, just hand us food that they have determined we should enjoy.    Returning back to what I said earlier, given this curt service, one would then expect the food to be amazing, and once again, this stereotype (works both ways) is confirmed.  I find it an odd practice, akin to maybe a tradition, as it's not repeated in a lot of other similarly ethnic restaurants.  That being said, my local hometown features a Vietnamese restaurant that very much breaks this trend, and is both welcoming and enjoyable.  But in this case, Saigon Maxim is damn good, some of the best Vietnamese cuisine I've had in ages, and despite the service, I'd consider returning...in fact I did a few hours later.  Not because of food, but because I left my debit card there.  When I called and asked, they answered that there was no such card around.  I don't believe they bothered to check, because when I drove down to double-check an hour later, it was found in the drawer underneath the till, meaning the person I talked to never bothered to each check.  Par the course.    Saigon Maxim is a good restaurant, just to clear the air.  The prices are reasonable, the food is good, and the service is rocket fast.  However, to quote the great Aaron Sorkin, it's not binary, you can be decent and gifted at the same time.    Food:  5/5 Service:  2/5 Presentation:  3/5 Value:  5/5 Recommendation:  3.5/5"}
{"text":"Pretty good food at reasonable prices.  The service is surprisingly speedy, so you can probably be in and out of here within 45 minutes if you eat in, but they can have food ready within 20 minutes if you order takeaway.  I've gone here at least 5-6 times now and I plan to be back the next time I have a craving for a vermicelli noodle bowl."}
{"text":"Not too bad for a first time experience.   The negative here was that they forgot our chicken salad rolls and brought them when we were half way through our meal. Kinda missed the point there guys.  Our dinners though were great and the portions were huge. We've found at many similar restaurants we frequent the quality has started to go. Things like pre-cooking the pork then throwing it on the grill for a minute to reheat it when someone orders. Not here though. Everything was fresh and cooked to order."}
{"text":"One of my favorite Vietnamese restaurants in the area. They are very friendly (though very busy) and give you a large portion. Food is usually fast (10 minute wait), but tastes pretty darn good.   The restaurant is medium sized, with about about 18 tables, so there's usually lots of space. It shows get busy around lunch hour though, since a lot of people working in the neighborhood head over for the good food and prices.   They are also really open to customizing dishes (eg. Noodles instead of rice) or sharing; a lot of Asian restaurants in Calgary really discourage sharing plates, but Saigon Maxim waiters will bring you extra bowls. Truly do appreciate it.   Also, I noticed that they will also give you a little extra  if you're ordering take out. Super thoughtful!"}
{"text":"Due to recommendations from friends and family, as well as faint memories of coming here in the past, Saigon was my #1 spot on my latest trip to Calgary. I actually ended up coming in 3 times in 2 days because people just KEPT WANTING to come back! And I have to say, I really didn't mind. The massive servings, which are really quite delicious, gave me enough Vietnamese food to eat for three straight days. Definitely okay with me.  The actual restaurant is relatively small and a little bit crowded, which can get a bit tiring when you're trying to have a conversation and keep getting drowned out by the hum of background noise, but that only happened to me on one occasion. But definitely beware of when you come because, as you may have inferred from the previous statement, it gets busy in here. Lunch and dinner are honestly kinda wild, and the workers are practically always running to keep up; luckily, going in during downtimes proves to be a relaxing experience and I've stayed for quite some time chatting before, and they just keep the tea flowing. I should note, though, that even when it's on the verge of frantic inside the restaurant, I never feel neglected and the food and service come very quickly. The family that owns it, and their other employees, are really friendly and always a pleasure to be served by. There are family photos around the restaurant as well, so being inside really feels like a close community experience. Besides the fam photos, the front entrance has super cool statuettes and other charming decor, but the place isn't OVERLY themed.  Now, for the behemoth-sized servings that are their food. I tried their #1, Deep Fried Pork Spring Rolls; #14, Deluxe Beef Noodle Soup; #20, Chicken Noodle Soup; and #71, Stir Fried Beef with Vegetables on Crispy Egg Noodles. I'll break them down one at a time here:  #1, Deep Fried Pork Spring Rolls. Classic spring rolls made extremely well. I don't have too much to say about them because nothing was really surprising, but I do have to say that it was hard to share them... I had to try pretty dang hard to not eat the other 2 when I finished mine!  #14, Deluxe Beef Noodle Soup. All four types of beef in the dish - cooked beef, brisket, beef ball, and tripe - are absolutely delicious. The broth is amazing and I consider this to be the best pho I've had to date. Plus, I couldn't even finish what I got in this bowl so I got to enjoy it again later that night. Warmed up at home, it, of course, wasn't AS good, but it still retained its wonderful flavour!  $20, Chicken Noodle Soup. The broth was good and the noodles and veggies were great but, sadly, I was pretty disappointed by the chicken. It came in nicely sliced pieces but it was quite dry and didn't really satisfy my palate that well; I found myself favouring everything else over it, unfortunately.  #71, Stir Fried Beef with Vegetables on Crispy Egg Noodles. Okay SO, I don't know if having a nest of egg noodles is a common dish or just something that Saigon Maxim does, but WOW was it ever cool!! The noodles at the top are crunchy and delicious and the ones at the bottom are covered in sauce and also SO TASTY. The stir-fry inside the nest was extremely well cooked, with the beef and vegetables having pretty much a perfect amount of crunch and warmth to them. The sauce that sat at the bottom of the dish was amazing and I found myself spooning it onto every bite, with a little bit of spice added. This dish was gigantic and I happily worked my way through it, until I got pretty close to the bottom and thought I was going to have to be rolled out of the restaurant. The flavour was wonderful, the presentation was spectacular and I think that this was my favourite of all 4 things that I tried this past Calgary trip.  Since Saigon Maxim is in my hometown neighbourhood, I can absolutely see myself coming back for AT LEAST one meal every time I'm home. Go Riverbend! Go Calgary!!"}
