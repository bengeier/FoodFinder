{"text":"I went here with my friends for New Year's Eve to have our last dinner of the year together in a fancy place. The food I have to say was outstanding. It was amazing and I couldn't stop eating it. I would give the food 5 stars. Although the reason for the rating to be 2 was due to the service at the David Duncan House. The staff were polite and were able to make us feel welcomed to such a matured high end atmosphere. But I'm the end when it came to getting the bill. The waiter gave us the bill and put all out orders together. We asked him he could split it numerous times but the waiter refused and said that we should of told him earlier. I found that quite disturbing and I will not be coming there again. The waiter should of split the bill for us. After paying the man we calculated the bill and found that the waiter had scammed us. I do not appreciate the service there and will definitely not be returning."}
{"text":"Excellent food especially the desert, the chief cooks in front you! Scrumptious!"}
{"text":"Great steak place. Prices are a lot higher than you're average steakhouse but you can definitely expect professionalism from the staff and your steak to be cooked to perfection.  Whenever I end up eating a bad steak somewhere I can rest assure that if I come to Duncan, the steak will fix my appetite. If you order the peppercorn steak they grill your steak in front of you. This is the only place I've seen that does that. The steak was delicious, and they give you the right amount of potatoes (mashed or ovened) with a side of vegetables. We weren't able to get desserts this time around since we were really full. The place had a very romantic era feel to it. Sort of feels like you're on the Titanic enjoying fine dining.  Will go back for sure to try more items."}
{"text":"A few months ago, I went here for my friend's birthday and this place was terrible!! The service sucks! All the waiters are rude, unresponsive and disrespectful to us! However, the peppercorn steak was amazingly delicious. For a fancy and expensive restaurant, I expect a higher customer service level and this place didn't achieve it."}
{"text":"My parents wrote my last yelp review about the David Duncan House. They didn't have the greatest time for their anniversary dinner, I attended the DDH tonight with my girlfriend and her family. Everyone in our party of 8 ordered the 16 Oz. Prime Rib and it was amazing. Super tender, amazing gravy, creamy mashed potatos, they did skimp on the veggies for the $37/ plate BUT I can guarantee that you will be full and satisfied with the quality of what they do not skimp on. The meat."}
{"text":"I have eaten at the David Duncan House many times over the years; we went there for many lunches and dinners.  Since I moved I haven't been there that often but last week I was treating a girlfriend to a birthday dinner, I wanted something upscale so I booked a table at David Duncan. I ordered the Crab cakes ($18.00)  the colour should have been my first clue, very dark and very crunchy.  I have no doubt they  came right out of the freezer in the deep fry.  They were so over-cooked that they did not taste like crab, they were tasteless. I ordered the Prime Rib medium rare with gravy on the side.  First of all my Prime Rib arrived covered in gravy so I sent it back.  My guest had ordered her Prime Rib medium well with gravy but didn't get any gravy. At first we thought the waitress had switched the plates but she insisted we had the right orders.  So my plate went back into the kitchen and I'm sure they just ran it under hot water to remove the gravy.  When she bough back my plate  she finally brought the gravy for my guest.  Also it was not busy it was a very quite night there.  When I tried my Prime Rib (medium rate) it was well done and  my guest's cut was very pink. I nibbled at the meat and then just put it aside,  The Yorkshire pudding was cold not cool but cold. When she finally came back to the table I showed her my meat and since there was not so much as a hit of pink it definitely was not Medium  Rare, I also said the Yorkshire was cold.   She mumbled something and walked off. I wasn't looking for a freebie I just wanted to treat a dear friend to a special evening.  My guest ate some of her meat (too pink for her) so the waitress asked if she wanted to take it home and she said no, so  I said you can put it in the same container as mine for the dogs. She did bring over one piece of Cheesecake because she heard me toast my friend's birthday. This is not the David Duncan House I remember, I don't mind pricey when the food it good but it wasn't good nor was it as ordered; and  they did nothing to  try and  correct the various problems.  Also for an 'upscale' restaurant the wine glasses were small, both the red and the white wine was served in the same glass...something you'd buy at a dollar store. It will be a long time before I venture back there.  I feel that there heydays might be long gone."}
{"text":"Love the table service Caesar Salad.....  and enjoyed the salad tremendously.....  Steak was cook to perfection....    Love the old Victorian ambience.. the decoration and the feel of the room."}
{"text":"Came here for lunch with my boss and love it.  The steak & lobster combo was very tasty.  Plenty of parking.   Service and ambiance is top notch.  Great for a special occasion."}
{"text":"I have been a regular at the Duncan House for years and have always loved their food, service, and the overall atmosphere. And let me tell you, the new management has improved this fine dining establishment in so many respects.   The menu has slightly changed, I believe for the better. Higher quality beef (didn't think it could be done) and they've added some more appetizer and main course options. Service is still top-rate. I am always greeted at the door with a smile.   Another reviewer stated how they were not recognized by the new host/hostess. How can that be possible when they haven't met you before? Doesn't make much sense.   They now have take-out which is a great bonus.   My advice is to try it for yourself.   You will not be disappointed!   Make sure to go there hungry!!"}
{"text":"I have been to the David Duncan House a few times over the past few years. Family and colleagues love it.  I thought it was above average as of a few years ago and certainly worth revisiting.  I go there invariably for special occasions and more often for professional functions due to location and parking availability.  But I am sorry to have seen its deterioration over the past few years - while curiously accompanied by soaring prices. My most recent experience was in December 2015 and it was a decidedly disappointing one. While I would still return for a professional function if costs are covered, David Duncan House has now lost me as patron.  Our group had a shrimp and salmon platter. If individually ordered the Smoked Salmon would have been $16, served on a bed of romaine lettuce with cream cheese, capers, red onion, and rye bread.  It was certainly not worth the price. The salmon was passable, the rye bread was tough, dry, and semi-stale. The platter included shrimps - and I certainly hope these were not $40 tiger shrimps  \"Colossal Shrimp Cocktail $40 -Four Tiger Shrimp served with our tangy house-made cocktail sauce\" pictured on their Duncan House website  And in any case the shrimp served was at best on par with frozen shrimp rings I could easily get from Loblaws or Metro;  the \"housemade cocktail\" was industrial, formulaic, and without character.  Then came the garden salad. There was more salad dressing than salad! I only ate the rim of the plate and left the rest intact. I thought it could be more appropriately named as a salt or briny soup or whatever with some greens thrown in.  Main course? I had what the waiter said was a \"12 oz\" NY striploin. The actual 8 oz slab of meat was lifeless and tough - which might as well be when the rest would have gone to waste. Yet in an amazing feat Duncan House overcooked a medium-rare to medium piece of meat. Maybe it was not the House's fault - it was just a piece of expired cheap frozen beef.  Yet on the brighter side David Duncan House gave myself some cooking confidence. In fact, I was at a house gathering of my cousin 's for a  party just a few days after - yet his first time following a cookbook doing a rib roast managed to put Duncan House to shame. Fine they're not exactly comparable, but it was an independent confirmation and consolidation of my disappointment. To paraphrase Bill Murray in his famous one-liner in Lost in Translation - what sort of restaurant makes you want to cook your own food?  I could easily have done a better job with my plug-in indoor electric grill - without  temperature control. Yes I did try it before.  Sides: the fries were cold and stale and about ~ two or three notches below those from McDonalds' and I left more than half wasted.  I had never tried fries there before (usually have mash potatoes or baked which was nothing great) - but this merely added insult to injury.  Any positives? As another couple of the group confirmed my above impression and did note this to the waiter we were offered a second chance. It was late by the time and so we decided to let it go. And as it was late I did take the cheesecake dessert home for family and did try a small piece of it at home which was reasonable to at best above average. It remains, however, only on par with frozen ones that can easily be had from frozen dessert aisles of any major supermarket chains.  The waiter was polite but seemed prone to mixing up the sides with the various orders (our group was 10 people, and he did write them down) which necessitated some last minute fiddling on his part during main course presentation. And as mentioned, ample parking was a bonus. The decor remains elegant but seems increasingly dated - perhaps by 2050 it will revived as retro.  The overall verdict? Will still return when it's sponsored and when expenses are paid for."}
{"text":"Spent the most horrible night of my life at the David Duncan House!    We sat in the lounge but ordered from the main dining room menu.  We made 2 orders of the medium rare bone-in prime rib ($42.95) and some soups and appetizers to share amongst 5 adults.  When an order of steak is over $40, I expect the food to at least be done right.    Nope!  The steaks came and we each had a bite and realized the steaks were not medium rare and they were nearly well done.  I cannot believe a steak house CANNOT get their steaks right.  Why bother going to a steak house if I am just looking for cooked cardboard?  The waitress came by and asked how we were doing and since she asked, I frankly told her the steak wasn't done right. She apologized and took all our plates away and said she will see what she can do for us.  A few moments later the manager, Jimmy (James) came and told us we should have mentioned it at the beginning and not when we finished the entire plate.  But the truth is we each had a bite of the 18 oz steak and that was it.  He continued to accuse us of trying to score a free meal.  It was absolutely insulting!    He then stormed off and came back with 1 medium rare bone in prime rib and told us we ate half of the other one so he wasn't going to give it back.  At that point I just told him to get us our bill because we were in no mood for eating after this treatment and I wasn't going to pay for the food they took away from us and that we didn't eat.    But guess what...he sent the waitress back with a bill that includes the 2 steaks.    Incredibly disgusted by the treatment we received tonight.  This place is nothing like the David Duncan House before.  I will not go back as long as these people are still running this place.  And James, you are such and embarrassment to the restaurant owner(s) and to the restaurant business."}
{"text":"GF now fiance wrote this under my account before she created her's..   \" My bf had taken me to David Duncan House for a surprise anniversary dinner, and I was very impressed with the excellent service, quality of dishes, and the beautiful appearance of the outside as well as the warm and intimate ambiance inside.    Waiters were very attentive and courteous..they placed us in a nice cozy corner upstairs which provided privacy but did not forget about us.   I ordered the Filet Mignon, which was served with grilled vegetables, and had garlic bread (so tasty we ordered another basket!) and a Cream of Mushroom soup to start, which was the best Cream of Mushroom soup I've ever had.  For dessert, we ordered Tiramisu, which was nice and soft, done perfectly.  To sum it up, my experience was wonderful and it's upscale fine dining in a warm and romantic atmosphere.  \""}
{"text":"David Duncan House is a great place for a fancy meal.  Not so much a restaurant, it's more of a mansion, if you will. I've been there twice in my life, and both times were for my parents' anniversary, and I treat it as a place for a special occasion, not for regular dining.  The mansion has tons of seating (well duh, it's a mansion) and you're always treated to the best of service, as it's an upscale establishment.  The appetizers are done well, and they're honestly mainly meant as something to sustain your stomach as you chat a bit and decide on your food choices.  I mainly see this place as a steakhouse, and I order the filet mignon, wrapped in bacon. This is a heavenly steak. It's perfectly seasoned, brilliantly juicy and the bacon adds a nice touch to the steak's flavour. My only recommendation is not to get it medium rare, as it gets a bit hard and isn't what you'd generally think of a medium rare. Rare is how I go.  The 6 oz. is also a good option, nice and juicy with a good touch.  The desserts are average, not to die for but good if you want to round off your dinner with a cheesecake, or a Baked Alaska, a dish truly from the upper reaches of the world.  A downside to the restaurant is the sheer cost. Everything for a four person family rounds out to 250-300 dollars, so if you're going to eat there, either be extremely hungry and ready to pay, or just eat a little. This is one of the reasons I'm taking a star off.  The other reason is that it takes forever for your food to arrive. By the time it comes, yore going to have been starving, which just adds to the food's taste. Personally I don't want to have to wait for a long time to get my food, and I guess with such a huge establishment they have a lot of people to serve, and I get that. I just thought it would come out a bit quicker.  all in all, it's a good restaurant, and definitely a good place to go if you want the fancy atmosphere or if you want to impress a guest. Also a good place to go with your girlfriend or your boyfriend. If I ever feel the craving for a steak and I've got a lot of money to spend, I'm heading here."}
{"text":"This is a very beautiful and upscale restaurant, with absolutely amazing service. Although the food is a bit pricey, it was so worth it. I had an amazing experience here."}
{"text":"I'm so disappointed at the new management, oh why did Bill have to sell this place? WHY!!?   Like Charlotte  W. has pretty much summarized, there are new additions to the menu, but they have taken off the soup/salad that used to come with your entrees. I talked to one of the old waiters, and he said that they are using better grade beef but it doesn't taste any different to me.   My usual order is their Prime Rib (the lighter cut has been taken off the menu), and the side veggies are now bok choy?! The shrimp cocktail now only comes in four shrimps instead of six like before..   Service is certainly not as friendly and warm as before. It's so disappointing as an old regular that I may need to search elsewhere for my go-to steak house unless this new owner gets his/her shit together."}
{"text":"I came here for a business lunch a couple of weeks ago.   First of all, this place is lovely. It's like an old school mansion with very ornate decor. Your granny will love this place. I was wearing a floral-patterned dress and I perfectly matched the drapes and carpeting.   The service was what you would expect from an old school steakhouse. He was attentive and professional, but a bit reserved. It was fine.  The food was pretty good. This wasn't the best steak I've ever had. It was a bit lacking in salt and I didn't want to ruin my steak with a nasty iodized table salt. A bit of fleur de sel on this baby would have been perfect. Or even a smoked salt. Yum. So the lack of salt did impact my enjoyment a bit. I suppose they're watching out for the old clientele's salt intake (most of the customers were 70 plus)."}
{"text":"This place was my 'go to' restaurant for two decades, but since the new owners took over I've stayed away. The menu prices have soared and you have to pay extra for every little thing 'a la carte' now. The salads/soups are not included with dinners while quantity and pricing has gone to the dogs. Why must all good thing come to an end?"}
{"text":"We agree with reviewers who are extremely disappointed by this once noble restaurant since its change of ownership.        Service  was impolite and ill-informed.       We were first placed for a party of six at a boardroom type table that could seat ten. The manager said he had no other table for six and claimed that the person who made our reservation had asked for that particular table. She corrected him. He gave another explanation, but found a round table for us a few minutes later.        The drinks waiter had never heard of a common aperitif. The traditional steak and seafood menu seemed overpriced by most steakhouse or fine dining standards.        The waiter hectored us as we ordered, rudely corrected a request for rack of lamb to be done pink, said we meant medium, and lectured us on all of his preferred definitions. When main courses finally arrived much later my rack of lamb ran the gamut from well-done to bloody. My wife's halibut was dry.       After dinner, two of our party asked to share a small 20-year-old port for twenty dollars a glass. Unlike the identical Taylor Fladgate I had recently enjoyed elsewhere at that price, it came in a tulip-shaped liqueur glass that may have spoiled its bouquet; the port didn't seem right. The liqueur glass held two ounces instead of the three elsewhere.       A waiter had knocked over an empty glass on his tray (for sharing). It wasn't replaced. After being loudly admonished for complaining, we spoke to the manager, who said he had seen the incident and had sent another glassful on the house. None had arrived. Eventually he himself brought another, but too late.       We had to ask for our bill after sitting for half an hour at an empty table.  When it came a waiter said that as well as coffee, all of our  \"aperitifs\" were on the house. Not so. They were on the bill. The port was not."}
{"text":"This was a disaster from start to finish for our party of six.  Upon being seated, we asked for separate checks for each couple, and even adjusted our seating positions to make it easier for the serving staff to identify each of the couples.  When we ordered pre-dinner drinks, one of my friends ordered an expensive Scotch \"neat\" It was provided to him \"on the rocks\". He returned it, only to get the same cold glass of Scotch back a moment later with the ice cubes removed.  A few minutes later, we received our garlic bread and appetizer tray; dill pickle wedges, olives and cottage cheese... Really? Cottage cheese? In a \"fine dining\" restaurant in 2016?  Appetizers:  According to my wife, the $26 bacon-wrapped scallops (4) were served in a virtually tasteless brown \"gravy-like\" substance. No seafood sauce whatever.  The servers also managed to forget the appetizer order for one of our party... and finally delivered it to him at the same time that they were serving the main courses to the rest of us. (BTW... the crab that is offered on a couple of the dishes is canned. According to my friends who had dined here before, it used to be fresh crab.)  Main course:  A number of us ordered the 8-ounce filet mignon ($50). My wife ordered hers \"medium\". It was delivered bloody... basically \"blue\". When she confronted the waiter about the undercooked steak, he asked \"Do you want it cooked some more?\". My friend ordered his medium-rare and got something somewhere between blue and rare. He also returned it. Both steaks were re-delivered substantially over-cooked, but with a brand-new baked potato.   The filet mignons were mostly tasteless, and had no sauce of any kind to improve their flavour. My wife asked if they had any Bearnaise sauce, which they said they did. Moments later, they gave her a gravy boat filled with a yellowish liquid, possibly some sort of gravy. Definitely not Bearnaise sauce.    ...And all the meals were cold.  Drinks:  A beer that was ordered by one of my friends never materialized. I ordered a glass of Port at the end of my meal. The waiter and I had a fairly lengthy discussion of whether I wanted the 10-year-old ($11) port or the 20-year-old ($16) port. I chose the 20-year. I never got either of them.  When asked, \"How is everything?\" by the waiter, one of the ladies at our table said \"Not very good\". The waiter seemed to ignore her, and just walked away. A few minutes later, he returned and told her \"You know, when some things go wrong, it's not my fault.\" Twenty minutes later (and before the bill was paid) he asked her if there was anything that he could do, \"Desserts, or anything?\" to make it better. She said \"No\".  When we finally received the bill, everything was on a single bill, including the Port that I never got. We had to individually go through the bill with the waiter, itemizing everything that each of us had. He did this for two of the couples, then turned to the third couple and said \"Everything else is yours\".  On the drive home, my wife commented that she would have liked to have a coffee and dessert, but that she didn't want to give these people any more money... and she loves coffee and dessert.  I would have preferred the Keg. Cheaper, better food, and better service. My wife agrees."}
{"text":"the setting is very nice,  calamari was chewy, steak was overcooked, service was slow and unprofessional, dessert was great. would not return"}
{"text":"Very cozy place to dine in whenever a special occasion has to be marked with a good meal.  While maybe predominantly known for steaks, I went for Scallops in garlic butter reduction.  Very well executed, scallops were cooked perfectly and I finished every morsel"}
{"text":"Terrible Service! Terrible Experience! Ordered a steak medium rare, came to me well done. When I brought it to the attention of the staff, I was told that I was wrong and that the steak was indeed medium rare. Not what I expected from a fine dining restaurant. Truly disappointed."}
{"text":"The David Duncan house is amazing. They treat me so well every time I visit. The staff is friendly and the food is fantastic. i try and have all my business functions here because they always make me look good. The building is very old but totally gorgeous! Lots of free parking and central. All in all. i love the place."}
{"text":"Be careful what you wish for. I wished this place would change, and now that it has...  Coming here, as I have reviewed before, is to come to a place of childhood memories. Where good things happened. So, it was to my big dismay that this Saturday's experience was as cold as ever.  First, the two gentleman hosts were not here to greet us. They are both older, but always happy to see the Wongs. This time, I was surprised to see two younger men who obviously didn't know who we were. They still greeted us and by any standards, were polite and gracious. But there was no warmth and I knew we wouldn't sit upstairs at our favorite location. Instead, we were trucked to the lowest floor of the restaurant right by the exit door. My dad had a view of someone's feet from the floor directly above us. It was a dark and creepy corner of the restaurant.  Then dinner. For those of you who have wished for a menu change, you got it. They have new food items: Grilled Atlantic Salmon (replaces the Broiled version), Porterhouse steak for two, Veal Chop, and Halibut...to name a few additions. New dessert items as well. Prices have, obviously, increased.  Now, here is where I was ticked. Before, every main course came with a salad or soup appetizer (no additional charge). They no longer do that. So, soup (the daily soup option) is an additional $6 and change, and then salad, a whopping $9 and change. But the salad and soups are still the same - they come in that mid-sized plate and all you get for the salad are iceberg leaves and sauce. Nothing else. And for $9? They changed the price, but nothing else. If you want to charge this high for cheap leaves, than you better start adding Cheese from the Highlands and Olives hand-picked from the Andalusia mountains.   One of the best value meals just became less so. You still get the garlic bread with Cottage Cheese and Pickles with your meals. But as a customer for over 15 years, I am not impressed.   The Escargots were really salty this time. My duck was the highlight of the meal (oh so tender and juicy), but my dad's version was tough and not great. So, already, inconsistencies for the same dish.  Service was not the best. It was a busy Saturday night so food was slow to come out. Our waiter knew us before and acknowledged us, but another Waiter forgot our coffees and charged us for it. Than at the end, because he was lazy, asked if we just wanted our coffees. No. We wanted to go home because we had waited long enough for our drinks. So he had to redo the bill, but not our problem.  Overall, I was disappointed. It's like coming home to find all your furniture has been re-arranged without your knowledge (and for the worse at that). That feeling of great unsettlement."}
{"text":"Should have stayed away despite reading the reviews.  Food: Seriously, I think I would have been happier with my steak at The Keg for a fraction of the price. I understand you're an \"upscale\" restaurant but the least you could do is have the food up to par. Ordered the duncan deluxe appetizer for two as well ($55) once again have your food reflect the price you're charging your customers.  Atmosphere: I honestly felt like I was trapped in a house with old decor and no windows. It felt suffocating. Totally not my scene.  Service: It was alright. Nothing out of the ordinary.  I would not return."}
{"text":"I've been going to the David Duncan house for the past decade. They now have new owners. I went for Valentines dinner tonight and the service was not the same. It sounded like a cafeteria! Wheres the music? All I heard was dishes clashing people running up and down the stairs the manager giving staff crap. I heard everything. Not to mention they were speaking in their own native tongue in front of customers. If you're going to speak your language do it in private don't do it in public. It's common courtesy for your customers that are spending top dollar to have top service. How do your customers know that you're not talking about them think about that. It's plain rude and no class. The setting is beautiful but it didn't feel beautiful because of the whole energy around the place. I could have went to Movies  Bar and Grill and had a better time This has never happened to me before at this place until the new owners. After we finished our bottle of wine, the waiter didn't even come to see if we wanted anything else to drink & our waters were not even topped up once, usually we don't even have to ask because they would just come around to do it. The appetizer tray with olives, cottage cheese, and pickles was about a third of the portion we received prior to the new owners. We were not asked if he wanted any bread after we finished the first basket. We had to flag down our waiter to place an order for our appetizer and when we placed our food order, it came and the meat was cooked just right & the sides were obviously  counted.... 4 tiny mushrooms, 4 asparagus  &  two tiny slices of carrot and a few green beans. BTW he was going to serve the cauliflower with my 10 ounce filet mignon for $49.95. I had to request asparagus on the side. I asked the waiter, why has this place changed so much? He replied, the previous owners' brother died 2 years ago and he practically ran the whole place. I felt bad so we did tip him well, however I do not think I will be visiting this restaurant in the near future until they work out all the kinks. We did not see a waiter through the evening unless I had to flag him down because usually there are waiters every few minutes to come by and top of your water or freshen up your appetizer tray & pour your wine. That didn't happen. For the prices they charge, they should be on the ball. Again, I have been going there from a decade ago and the service has gone downhill big time. We also wanted to have a grand marnier and coffee for dessert in the bar on the main floor and there were children that were propped up on our knees on bar stools, hunchng over the bar. Is that how I want to spend my Valentines dinner? Why can't parents get a babysitter and leave their children at home. This is the night for couples only. We paid approximately 300 dollars to have a romantic dinner and to have a simple nightcap would have been reading I did better, but to be in a nursery section of a fine dining restaurant is unacceptable. We had no choice but to leave."}
{"text":"Heard a lot about this place and finally went, overall our experience was great. It's a historic house and the restaurant inside is 4 levels. It's decorated with dark wood, golden statues, chandeliers and large staircases. Its a little old fashioned...looks like what the first class passengers had in the movie Titanic. For food we had the fried calimari and Caesar salad to start. They make the salad table side which is a cool experience for someone who has never seen this. They bring out warm garlic bread, cottage cheese, pickles and olives for the table as well. For the mains we had the baby back ribs, NY steak and prime rib. Everything tasted great and I was especially impressed with the prime rib. For deserts we had the tiramisu and cheesecake. I would not recommend the cheesecake- it was very dense not at all what you would expect at a place like this. The service was also pretty slow, it took around 15 minutes before someone came to take a drink order...but that could have been just the day we went. The staff was all nice and friendly. Pricing is on the high side but it's what you would expect for a place like this. Vodka martini is around $20. Overall I would come here again- not for the food but more for the atmosphere, or to bring people from out of town."}
{"text":"I would def come back. walking into the restaurant is like going to a different era. Service was excellent. Food was fine. They make ceasar salad from scratch table side."}
{"text":"Fine dining restaurant with an old classy ambience. Slightly dark and not the best layout as it is a converted mansion. Classic table side service of Caesar salad and other dishes though I only received salad service but I thought it was a nice touch and a cool European old school service experience. All very tasty but a little awkward to converse at dinner with the waiter joining you for a good 15 mins. I took my fiancé here for a romantic dinner but the service was extremely slow. And our meals were overcooked quite a bit the first time so we sent it back. We had almost been there 2 hours by the time we finished our meals but the manager apologized and compd our meals which was great of him and saved me an arm and leg. The food was quite good but I wouldn't say it meets price expectation. I think a keg steak is a good comparison and bang for your buck I would choose the keg over david Duncan most times. Great place to go for a classier or romantic dinner but a special occasion only type restaurant. 3.8/5"}
{"text":"Recently dined here and meal was nothing to rave about.  The restaurant has great potential but it's major flaw is the food.  Old world ambiance but food quality is below par.  The fried calamari are very dark, perhaps for not changing the oil recently.  They were rubbery and looked like they came from the frozen section at Costco.  They claim the steak are USDA Prime/Choice cuts.  However found the steak to not be that tender or flavourful.  We are in Canada, they should be using dry aged Prime Canadian beef.  The double baked potato was not impressive, it simply looked like they scooped their mash potato into hollowed out potato skins.  I will say the staff were very friendly, if they can improve the food quality, this would be a great dining experience."}
{"text":"Classic steakhouse with a classic vibe. New owners know what they're doing. Food and service are both incredible!"}

{"text":"I was originally introduced to David Duncan House by someone I really cared about at that time, Chris, my date for that evening.  It was a rocky relationship for sure and it was for Valentines day dinner a few years back and I have to say it was truly an amazing experience... and the food was ok too lol.  Sometimes it is the company and  not the food that makes a great place. Unfortunately it turned out to be our last date. If you have to have a last date, this is definitely a great place, one not easily forgotten.  The atmosphere was geared more towards business than romance (maybe that was a clue). Everything was cooked to perfection and seemed very reasonable.  I would definitely go back, and have on a few occasions,  just never on a date and never on Valentines day."}
{"text":"The main course was very dry- Halabat fish. The service person not very friendly. I'm part of a large group and 3 of us did not eat the fish."}
{"text":"I went to the Duncan House through an invitation from a relative. This place is hard to notice when driving by Don Mills (and not visible from York Mills) and doesn't look anything special from the outside. But oh boy, when you do enter, it's got that antique renaissance feel to it. The interior is very nice and I loved how it was laid out.   Anyhow, the food, considering the price, wasn't the best thing ever. My steak order wasn't too shabby but other members certainly did not enjoy their order (I believe it was the corn steak or something), saying it was too saucy or too much spice.   Service was very nice and serving wasn't too slow. Again, place is not bad at all, and I overall enjoyed the food, but I can't say it was worth the cost. But I do recommend people go once to dine in a fine atmosphere (unless there are other groups of people coming in dressed in garbage clothes - they need to enforce the dress code)"}
{"text":"I was dazzled when I first arrived to the restaurant. A huge historic looking house with extravagant Victorian interior and decor. I'd say this is the place to impress a girl. Friendly staffs helped us with our coats at the counter and then led us to a table near the fireplace. So far, the experience was good until we ordered our food.  I ordered a medium rare prime rib for my entree which came with a choice of a soup or  a salad. I got a little bit frustrated after repeatedly asking our server if we could pay the price difference to substitute the soup in our meal with a French Onion Soup. Instead, we found out that we had to pay the full price for a supposedly 'substitute' instead. So, in the end, we had to order the soup on its own and settled with the extra salad in our meal. At this time, my meter bar had slightly gone down.  As starters, we were served a platter of olives, dill pickles and cottage cheese with a refillable basket of garlic bread. We kept munching on the garlic bread because we liked to soak our bread into the soup. Though, I wished the bread were fresh from the oven. They weren't warm at all.  Our French Onion Soup was great and rich in flavour. When my prime rib arrived, I was disappointed. It was not cooked medium rare like what I asked for. It was all cooked in the center. They replaced my prime rib and it came out perfect the second time. However, the meat was not as tender as I hoped it to be. It wasn't really juicy either.  Their dessert menu was also on the safer side. There wasn't a huge selection to choose from. Again, I was disappointed at first sight. It did not look like classic tiramisu but looked more like a giant piece of sponge cake. Then when I had a bite of it, I realized I was wrong. The tiramisu tasted heavenly and super smooth. We also ordered the Spanish Coffee that was prepared at our table. It had Brandy, Tia Maria and whipped cream in it. Quite entertaining to see how the coffee was put together and  tossed into flames!"}
{"text":"An older relative loves this place, so we'd go there for Mother's Day, birthdays, etc.   I used to think that I couldn't like this restaurant, as the food is \"traditional\" (i.e. outdated, boring) steak+seafood throwing-everything-under-a-broiler type, and I am not super comfortable having senior citizens wait on me.   Fast forward.......a few encounters with tortuously bad trendy / fusion meals later, I've come to appreciate this place more because it sticks to what it's good at, and delivers consistently.   As for service, if the senior citizens working there are happy doing what they do, I figured I should just be thankful and enjoy the impeccable services that result from their years' of experience.   The building is impressive looking, both inside and out, with lots of architectural and decorative details. The restaurant is quite big, but the split-level layout usually puts enough distance and separation between your table and the others so that a private / intimate dining experience is possible if desired."}
{"text":"I have been coming here for years and the experience has varied in quality. Sometimes it's the best steak, and sometimes it's average.   It is nice to change it up from my regular steak spot(Ruth's Chris). And the ambiance and decor make it an interesting place to bring people who have never been. Not many places that make food table side(caesar salad and cherry jubilee)too, which also add a unique touch your guests will appreciate.   If you want a classy place for steak and don't want the bother of parking/driving downtown this is your spot."}
{"text":"Given that this is an expensive, classy restaurant I was surprised at how bad the service was. Our server was hard to find and didn't check up on us, which dragged our dinner time at least 40mins longer than it needed to be. The French onion soup (we ordered 4) also came lukewarm, but we couldn't find our server for the longest time so just ended up drinking it anyway. The food was average for the price we paid. Definitely here for the architecture and ambiance."}
{"text":"My favorite steak house ever. All guy waitors... i feel like a queen when i dine there. Top notch service."}
{"text":"Not to put down any of the other reviews here, but this place is definitely overrated for the decor, service and $$$$. It's unfortunate that the one thing that sticks in my mind from my 6 person team lunch is the older waiter arguing with my co-worker over whether or not her Filet Mignon was cooked to medium rare or not. She had requested med-rare and it was over done. Having worked in the restaurant industry for 8+ years here is a tip: You don't argue with a customer. Especially at a so called \"higher end\" establishment.  Also, my espresso came half in the cup, half on the saucer. (See FourSquare for pic) Not planning on returning or recommending this restaurant.  On a positive: The 2 younger ladies who served us (1 in training) were very nice and took care of us as best they could."}
{"text":"We've been there before the renovations and now after. Spectacular job. Same style, same feeling but with a modern elegant touch.  New carpets and chairs, renovated the restrooms (!!!) and of course upgraded the menu. Immediately you can tell that the quality of the food and ingredients are upscale. I usually go for the prime rib but now the fish options are to die. We loved to sit by the fireplace but with the bar area upgraded this is our new spot. Not hungry? Just go for a cocktail as the mixologists working there are amazing!"}
{"text":"The SERVICE here is amazing! everyone is very very detail oriented! and that's what makes the experience here such a wonderful experience, and keeps us coming back! thank you! The food here I would not give 5 stars but the experience and the beauty of the building makes up for it! I love the cheese, olives and pickles they give us at the beginning with nice warm soft bread. The steak was pretty big! We ordered a prime rib (my fav!) wanted it rare, but it came out kind of medium-ish and got a seafood platter ($65) which was not that amazing, 1 lobster tail, 1 jumbo shrimp, 2 oysters Rockefeller, some scallops, king crab/Alaskan king crab legs. sounds like a lot, but it isn't cause it all fits into one plate! but anyways overall the price is fair and the food is good, just not the best."}
{"text":"There are better fine dining places than here. Servers were great and attentive. (However the server did get my soup order wrong but no big deal) Their main courses needed work. My lamb was on the brunt side. And the steak quality wasn't quite there. If you're looking for a good steak place, I'd drive a little farther to Peter's Fine Dining, for similar pricing and better quality food. Their Apple pie is bomb though (freshly made)"}
{"text":"New owners apparently and it is evident, will not be returning after horrid experience   Medium well filet came medium rare, took 30 mins to get waiter to cook some more and than half came well done other half still medium rare  Presentation was better but food quality, cooking and service down a notch, previously my favourite restaurant but I will never return  Thanks for the memories old owners"}
{"text":"Went for lunch and ordered off the fish menu. Although the ambience is great, the food was very mediocre and the wait staff pretty bad. They kept harrassing us to order dessert and were not very helpful with menu suggestions."}
{"text":"This restaurant is a treasure. Fantastic food and great atmosphere. There is a fantastic wine list and the staff is very knowledgeable about the wine. We had oysters, jumbo shrimp, and broiled crab legs for appetizers. All of it was very fresh and tasted amazing. We then had the Caesar salad which they hand make at the table. OVER THE TOP! I have never had a better Caesar salad. They make the dressing from scratch in front of you and there is none better. I had the prime rib and it came perfectly cooked and with a yorkshire pudding. Awesome! Desert was Tiramisu with a Spanish coffee which was also fantastic. They put on a show when making Spanish coffee and it tastes as good as the show. The staff was perfect. Very highly recommended!"}
{"text":"If you want to make a great impression and/or find a place to eat for a special, SPECIAL occasion David Duncan House will certainly wow your guests. This historical Victorian house dating back from 1865 was converted into a beautiful fine dinning place, with classic wood carved decor it certainly gives a Bourgeoisie feeling.  Not to mention its hard not to see the beautiful stain glass light illuminating the large two floor dining space.   Servers dressed to the \"T\" in a comfy ambiance with plenty of ample tables (all full) I ensured reservations were made. For starters we both shared their fried calamari..beautifully presented it was a delight (HOWEVER  I prefer grilled, like how Mamma Martino does it)  For entree, I ordered their 12 oz NY Steak strip, served with mashed potatoes and seasonal vegetables.   She ordered their pan seared scallops, served with a flavored butter rice and seasonal vegetables   The only downside aside from its being overpriced was the service, though I did find them very knowledgeable and extremely courteous service was slow. It took well over 10-15min to get the bill."}
{"text":"This restaurant has been my company's go-to-place for almost a decade, admin appreciation days, retirement parties, etc.  I like coming at lunch time only because the prices fit my budget better. The service is perfect. The food is very good. I've tried NY steaks, prime rib, duck, salmon. Everything is cooked to perfection.  The venue has a classy vintage feel with ample parking."}
{"text":"I've lived in the area for over two decades. I really wanted to love David Duncan House. i really did... But *sigh*. Service was pretty mediocre for the bill coming up to $300 for two. The wine glasses are the small ones that you get from the dollar store. The waiter liked to fill them up almost to the top with our bottle of Chianti Classico - I guess he didn't want to come by and fill them up too often. The last time I was served wine like this was at an open bar at a cheap wedding. Poor Chianti.   We ordered the seafood platter for two. it came with some tiny oysters that looked old and some pieces of bread with cream cheese on top to put the smoked salmon on. The shrimp were just OK. Definitely a miss.  I had the prime rib - I asked for it medium rare and in my eyes it was done medium but the waiter insisted it was medium rare. I asked for pepper on the table but the waiter said he doesn't have and to just let him know when - then he violently cracked a whole heap on the side of my plate... Weird.  My friend had the bone-in ribeye steak. It was good. The assistant came by and served the potato but he was really hurried and kind of violently dressed the potato. I guess the theme of the restaurant is 'violently dressing food'.    To top off the dinner we ordered the cherries jubilee for two - THIS WAS THE WORST EVER. The cherries weren't even really caramelized and by the time the ice cream came to us it was a melting heap of mess. The dessert itself tasted pretty terrible.   I am so glad I came here with friends before I took a client as I would never take a client here."}
{"text":"Traditional. Ornate. Comfortable. Impressive decor. Professional service. Fair food.  The absolutely fantastic 16oz rib steak was the only dish that showed the kitchen's potential, and was much better then the sirloin Steak, over cooked lobster, or disappointing duck.  I had the special, Orange grand marnier duck, roasted and deboned.  Orange sauce was china town, overwhelmingly thick and doesn't seem to lend itself to anything. What are they going for here? Also, duck was chewy. Fair enough, the waiter warned me it would be, but this was kind of gross. I've had duck many times.  Cold plate appetizer platter for two is better shared by four. Be warned, don't share this one with less then three people. Herring, shrimp, jumbo shrimp, cocktail sauce (so much cocktail sauce it was gross), smoked salmon, capers, cucumbers, etc... On a huge platter.   Pretty typical outdated steak house dining kind of stuff."}
{"text":"I was invited on an occasion with some very nice family friends and honestly, I'm going to put it out there that the food was good.  However, they lose stars from me because of poor service.  We probably ate $50-60 worth of stuff each so it's not like anyone was cheap-ing out.    I ordered the rib-eye steak and I must admit that this was cooked to perfection.  The beef was juicy and it was actually really medium rare.  The caesar salad was also delicious.    However, service was extremely mediocre.  They pretty much handed us our bill in the middle of a conversation we were having and as soon as we paid our bill, they stopped all their service altogether.  Everyone's water glasses were empty and they didn't even ask to refill them.  It was such an appalling \"let me take your money so that you can gtho\" attitude.  For a supposedly high-end restaurant, I find this extremely rude and I'm actually genuinely upset about this.    In any case, although the food was good, it's not like I can't get that same quality somewhere else in Toronto (that also has great service).  Really not sure if I'm going to come back.  I really also hope they take these reviews into serious consideration because I'm reading other people's reviews and clearly, I'm not the only one who is unhappy with their service."}
{"text":"I walked into a sea of white hair, not knowing what to expect. The table to our right was celebrating a 90th birthday and the table to the left could have been celebrating their 90th wedding anniversary.  Duncan House is my dad's favorite restaurant so naturally he would choose this establishment to have our family's Mother's Day dinner. I must say, I was quite impressed!  The Highlights: - This place is gorgeous both inside and out - Ample amount of seating for both small and big groups - The waiters are all very professional and seasoned in the food serving business (you won't find your neighbor's 16 year old kid working here) - Free hors d'oeuvres at the start of your meal (pickles, olives, cottage cheese, and garlic bread) - Reasonable prices (all main entrees come with a salad or soup of the day... a good amount too) - Parking is a plenty and free - Desserts are made on site and delicious... and you can get it for a low price - Bottomless coffee for $1.75 - Quiet so you can carry on a conversation with your dining companions  I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"The steak and the salad was perfect. But the waiter who serve our table this afternoon was rude and I was surprised that we have to ask him for steak knives...at a fine dining restaurant. Very disappointed with the service and he still pushes us to pay 18% tips....I don't know if he had a fight with the wife in the morning or maybe we are Asian? Will not return again."}
{"text":"I didn't think they actually meant the resto was a house when I first heard we were coming here for a client lunch.. but it was...!  More like a two-storey mansion.  The service was great, waiter was very attentive and there was complimentary coat check.  Most of the visitors there were in business wear and presumably taking a fancier lunch break from work.    I ordered the clam chowder to start, and it was one of the best ones I had - definitely comparable to what I tried when I went to the east coast.  Creamy and flavoured to perfection, I can't even.    I also had a spoonful of their special French onion soup.  Oh em gee.  The first and only time I ever had it was unfortunately at Timmie's.  My impression of French onion was forever tainted after that time.. but Duncan House saved this dish for me.  The cheese coated the soup perfectly and the onion flavour seeped deliciously through.  However, it's definitely a very filling soup as the people that ordered it all felt somewhat full after finishing it.    For the main, I had the special of the day which was a 6oz New York steak with crab cake and seasonal veggies.  The surf and turf combo was nice since the resto is supposed to be known for both.  However, I found the crab cake a little salty.  I had my steak medium rare, and that was done just right with nice, subtle seasoning.    Recommended for a special occasion as the dinner menu is definitely on the pricey side - but ambiance is great and good for bigger groups as well."}
{"text":"Special shoutout to Eric for his incredible service on several occasions!  I have to say that I hope the recent 'changes' also include a revamp of the food menu. I was so looking forward to dining here given the reputation and recommendations, and have dined here twice now for corporate dinners. On the first occasion, I had a garden salad which was overdressed iceberg lettuce with one piece of tomato and one piece of cucumber, followed by a VERY overcooked 'chicken neptune.' On the second night, I ordered the 'seafood delight' which was presented as small cut up portions of salmon and halibut, 2 shrimp and 1 scallop, with vegetables. It was disappointing, and bland overall. The saving grace has been dessert with a great chocolate truffle cake and cherry cheesecake! I know this place is a historic 'institution;' however, the menu needs updating and attention to detail, especially given the prices!"}
{"text":"We come here for the food, not the décor, not the starchiness, and it does not disappoint. I especially love the oysters ... personally, my favourite place for oysters. The lamb is exquisite, as are most of their dishes. The service is also very good. Will continue to come; even under different management, the food is still good."}
{"text":"Pros: Good service, convenient location and great environment Cons: Too dry with burnt, worst steakhouse ever, the cooking degree looks good, but taste wasn't good as it looks like. Totally not worth the price. I only order the steak and wine because this restaurant is too pricy and the experience was not very satisfied overall.  However, I saw other tables who order the appetizer and pasta and ie smells so good. Doesn't a steakhouse should specialize on steak?"}
{"text":"David Duncan House is guaranteed to make an impression on guests, especially if you don't give them any sense of what to expect. Although the branding boasts an \"Art Deco experience,\" DD delivers an experience that seems to combine the hardwood interiors akin to Victorian Club Houses and opulent 1980s soap opera sets. The menu features Victorian-era dishes as well, including Cherries Jubilee (first created in 1887, to celebrate Queen Victoria's 50th year as monarch), and Peach Melba (first created in 1892, named after Australian soprano, Nellie Melba).   The restaurant is set apart from any retail area off Don Mills road - it's a destination in and of itself, so you'll want to make a reservation ahead of time. Staff are all highly professional and take great pride in their ability to make sound recommendations and light desserts on fire without batting an eye. Step back into history and enjoy an opulent dining experience!"}
{"text":"This place is about as old school as it gets -- lots of wood, low lighting, dudes in tuxes serving you. If that's what you're looking for David Duncan is the place for you. Ambience is slightly upscale but there were plenty of people not dressed up. Still I wore a jacket (no tie) for dinner and did not look out of place.  I had the chicken Neptune -- a gilled chicken breast with crab meat and some kind of sauce on top. The crab was the real thing (not the fake stuff made out of mystery fish bits) and there was plenty of it. But the chicken was a bit blah. Nothing bad, just nothing exciting. Veggies were excellent (carrot and parsnip), looked like they were broiled and while caramelized on the outside still retained a slight crispiness when bitten, which is the way I like it. Had a bit of my son's rapini which was also very well done.  Garden salad was plain but the Caesar salad looked pretty good. Didn't have dessert but I thought the brewed coffee was good.  Was there for a private party (not really private as we had most but not all of the top floor) and the staff handled the large group well. They also gave us space and time after dinner was over which was nice for mingling and catching up.  Took a sneak peak at the menu, I'd say that the steak/chops prices are not as high as the high-end places in Toronto, maybe $5-$10 cheaper than you'd expect to pay for a similar cut at the Morton's, Harbour Sixty etc.   Other miscellaneous comments -- easy to get to location and giant parking lot make it very convenient for large group like we had. But top floor was getting very warm by the end of the evening. Bathroom was all the way on the first floor and it was tiny, given the size of the restaurant."}
{"text":"Don't go there. Bad service and mediocre food.  Lots of choices. Choose somewhere else. We eat out at nice restaurants a lot and thought this would be nice but not even as good as the Keg."}
{"text":"This place has been around for a VERY long time, which kinda gives you an idea how they managed to do so.  If you do choose to come here, do not and I repeat DO NOT expect it to be like The Keg or other modern steak restaurants out there.  The property itself is a pretty big house that you can see off the main road. Those who's been around the North York area have probably passed by many times. Once turning down and into the property, you'll see a relatively large parking lot so parking shouldnt be a problem. Once you make your way into the restaurant, almost immediately you'll be greeted by some friendly staff members, which is nice to have someone acknowledge you upon your arrival. The decor is somewhat dimlit but it adds to the ambience. Right in the middle of the ceiling on the upper floor is a huge piece of stained glass that really gives the place a feeling like you're back in the old days - the restaurant is wood throughout and lots of carvings everywhere; very detailed. Many years ago when I first went, the place was way more strict and upscale, like you have to dress up super fancy and put together to go in, but seems like nowadays theyre a bit more laid back (with the dress code at least). As if the main and upper floor isnt big enough already, they also have a basement - you really need to walk around and look at all the details and decor.  Alright, onto the food. Prices are only a bit higher than most other fine dining restaurants out there, or the same. Their lobster tail is not only nicely presented (with half a lemon placed inside a small gauze baggie tied with a ribbon so your fingers dont get sticky or have the seeds falling out) but it was also very generous in portion size and cooked almost perfectly (just a tad overcooked for my liking). Same goes for their steak, which wasnt dry at all and once you cut into it, the colour was beautiful. A fave of mine is the french onion soup - lots of ingredients in there which could be a meal in itself. It was full of flavour (and cheese) and not salt. If you're a fan of escargots (yes, snails) like I am, they also offer that here. For that though I wouldve liked it on a bed of mashed potatoes but thats just my preference. Also, one of the few places that offer table side cooking, which has a nice little entertainment aspect.   As this was a surprise birthday dinner, at the end of my meal, the staff brought out a piece of cheesecake with a lit candle (no singing involved thank you very much). The cheesecake is on their dessert menu; dont remember if it was made in house or not but it was very creamy and light.   All in all, this is a restaurant with lots of history and one that they like to stick by, which is nice to find in this part of town. Expect prices to be comparable to other fine dining places, with generous portion sizes. Staff are experienced and friendly. If youre coming here on weekends or the holidays, booking a table might be a smart idea."}
{"text":"I will give this restaurant a five star based on food and value for money.   I have been quite a few times and always happy with my visit. The servers know their food and are always happy to recommend items on the menu. They are very courteous too so we need to ask them to give servers at Canoe a good training.   I have tried quite a few items here but I would stick to steak as it seems to be their specialty. They always come prepared. Best kept secret? They have a private room that can accommodate 15 - 30 people so it's good for parties. Took a relative here once for a birthday bonanza and we all enjoyed it.   It's rather quiet but not as uptight as Octagon or Pangea. Best reason to come here? Service. It's superb.   I will come back and definitely recommend this place."}
{"text":"The David Duncan house is by far the best restaurant I have ever been to in Toronto. The food is spectacular every single time and the staff are welcoming and extremely accommodating. The decor is such that it makes you feel like you have gone back in time and has true old world elegance. It is classy and in my opinion the absolute best. Every single time my husband and I have dinner there we are never disappointed.  Give it a try for yourself."}
{"text":"Came here with tzutzuko mu on a Friday night. What a treat!  David Duncan House is a restored 19th century mansion (much too big to be called \"house\"). The decor inside definitely has a European flair, it reminded me of some of the places I used to dine at out in the countryside in England. It's the type of spot that older people would love - very traditional - but the service, ambiance and decor make it a perfect date spot.   Since my DC knew all the staff (they are Greek, naturally) we were seated in a prime spot next to a giant roaring fireplace. Very nice!  The menu is nothing to excite, unless you are a meat lover! It's all about the steak here, although they do have a lot of seafood options. We ordered a Chateaubriand Bouquetiere (for 2) which is basically a giant beef tenderloin served with lots of grilled veggies, potatoes and Bearnaise sauce on the side. A waiter brings out a cart and sears the meat right by your table, it's fun to watch!   For dessert we had Cherries Jubilee, which was also made tableside. Cherries flambeed with butter and sugar, then poured overtop a scoop of ice cream. I was too full to have more than a taste, but it was lovely.  Food was surprisingly well-priced too all things considering. Wine list is extensive.   Absolutely lovely place for a special occasion!"}
{"text":"My wife and I came here for dinner last night. Never heard of this place and I always drive passed this place all the time.   I really love this restaurant; the house is very impressive and rich in history, and the interior decor is grand and stunning to say the least. One of the best French decor in the city.   Awesome experience here. The waiter was professional and the service was top notch!    My wife ordered Caesar Salad and I ordered Escargot for starters. They make the Caesars in front of you which was a cool experience. My wife said the Caesar was creamy and a hint of vinegar just like how she wants it. My escargot was tender and was bathed in butter and garlic; super tender and delicious!  They also flambé the escargot in front you. What an experience!!!  For the mains, my wife ordered the Duckling a l'Orange Grand Marnier and I went with Peppercorn Steak - medium rare. The duck came first and it looks absolutely delicious. My wife said the duck was crispy, deboned and the orange sauce really complimented the duck; well balanced, not too too sweet. Finally our waiter pulled the flambé station over and cooked the peppercorn sauce. When it was ready, he poured it on top of the steak and hand it over. I cut the steak and it felt like I was cutting butter. Medium rare to perfection!  They got it right!    We end the night sharing the tiramisu. Oh my god, the tiramisu was heavenly, possibly the best that I've had anywhere. Yelpers, this is a definite must try!  With all of my restaurant reviews, I always ask will we come back?  Oh yes, most definitely. I've never tip a restaurant 25% but this place deserves it.   Food:  5/5 Ambience:  5/5 Service:  5/5 Cleanliness:  5/5"}
{"text":"I came here for my friend's wedding lunch reception. Their steak is not bad and the portion is very generous. We had salad, steak and tiramisu. The decor is very grand. Overall, good experience!"}
{"text":"Fabulous!  We dined in a private room with a very attentive waiter...food was delicious...would absolutely recommend this place for fine dining."}
{"text":"Moved rating from two start to one. Went back. The concierge at the front desk is completely rude and unprofessional as a result of him we will not go back. This ass clown was giving us attitude in abooking made a month a go. We were told some that some arrangements would be made for a birthday. Not a thing was done. The ass clown said there were no notes on the reservation. Like it is out job to manage their bookings. The worst part of this guy was his attitude. He should just change his name to ass clown."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere and friendly staff.  The garlic bread was freshly baked and delicious but at the end of the night it was a bit too much garlic combined with Caesar salad which was also full of fresh garlic. You must try their Caesar salad as they come prepare by your table like other high end steak houses. We tried their rib eye, peppercorn, seafood delight, and duckling all of which were all very flavourful. A must try if you're a steak lover!"}
{"text":"Definitely not worth the money, very poor value. We ordered our steaks medium rare and they came out burnt. The calamari we ordered was comparable to the frozen kind you buy at a grocery store. The service was good initially but they brought one member of our group the wrong order and did nothing to remedy the situation. One of the waiters was very rude when we tried to explain the situation. The only reason this place gets 2 stars is because the Caesar salad was good.   Just go to the Keg up the street where you get better food for lower prices."}
{"text":"Came here for a meet and greet with some movie stars from the Philippines.   The house is pretty cool considering it was someone's house before but it also felt a little haunted.  I felt the people from paintings were gonna come to life or something. lol  Didn't have steak but did eat their seafood and ice cream which was just okay.  Actually the ice cream I wasn't too much of a fan.  Also not a fan of the lighting in the restaurant."}
{"text":"I made a visit to the Duncan house, thinking of having a nice steak dinner. The ambiance is nice, and interior is very nicely decorated.  But I'm all about the food.  We ordered 4 of the 16 oz rib eye steaks, with one ending up overcooked and the other undercooked. Bluntly put,  the quality and consistency of the steak is not worth the price. You will get a better rib eye at The Keg for a lower price.  You will get a far better steak at Jacob for the same price.  To top it off,  the waiter was near impossible to find."}
{"text":"I love this place for business meetings and family dinners. The great food and good services. Enjoy.. Bon appétit!!!"}
{"text":"I have been here a handful of times and unlike most of the reviews found here, my experience has always been a 4 star minimum.   The steak is perfectly aged and always cooked exactly to my liking. Salads are made fresh and dressed right at the edge of your table. Complimentary bread and finger food (olives, pickles, etc) are a nice touch.   It is a little on the pricey side, but the ambiance is very nice. I will continue to give this place business as it has always served me great. It's truly unfortunate to see an increase in low rating reviews."}
