{"text":"This place has really good mozzarella sticks and drinks which I think are reasonably priced. The service was okay."}
{"text":"This place a nice little Mexican restaurant just off Kingston road, and if you blinked you'd miss it... Though while shopping in whitby we decided stop for a beer during a warm weekend, they had a nice little patio, live music, and dos Equis on tap! True Mexican restaurant... Food was also great! We had the Big Sure Fish Tacos... Awesome!!! Stop by if you're looking for some place that's local..."}
{"text":"Myself and my girlfriend love this place, the drinks are fantastic, the taco dishes/burrito's are always tasty. Not to mention the portion sizes are great. It's a must try.


I hear they may be for sale, I hope it isn't true it's refreshing to eat at a family owned restaurant, rather than the loads of chain restaurant crap we have around now."}
{"text":"Excellent prices, excellent dishes, excellent service.

I didn't like the steak sandwich (chewy steak) or the fish tacos (breaded fishballs in a tortilla), but the chimichanga and other taco/quesadilla-like plates are wonderful. Ask for their tray of hot sauces, the habanero sauce they carry is especially good.

I try to come here every time I'm in Whitby."}
{"text":"I had the Big Sur fish tacos and they were amazing!  The fresh coleslaw and pico de gallo contrasted well with the deep fried mahi mahi cubes.  Having it in a hard taco made for a messy meal.  Wish it was on a larger plate.  The rice and refrained beans on the side were nothing special.

Service was friendly and attentive.  Loved the complementary tortilla chips and warm salsa as soon as you sit down.  Wanted to order the tuna cerviche, but was told it's not available.  Maybe have to call ahead to check if they have it in on hand?  

Can't wait to try some of their other dishes!"}
{"text":"The best chicken street tacos and chicken enchiladas ever! Every time my boyfriend and I go we always enjoy whatever we get."}
{"text":"We happened to be Whitby for a soccer tournament and googled for a restaurant for lunch. Gave this place a try from all the rave reviews and it was better than we expected! Super friendly staff, yummy food and good portions!
What a gem! Try the enchiladas and spicy chorizo chimichanga!"}
{"text":"This place has awesome Mexican food and I'm a bit ashamed to admit I've come twice in one week on more than one occasion. My favourite is the Chicken Chimichanga, although the nachos, tacos, and Chorizo con queso are very good as well. The staff are always friendly. If you have room after your meal, the dessert nachos and deep-fried ice cream are also delicious!"}
{"text":"Los Cabos - whenever I hear those 2 words I think of a luxurious beachfront Riu resort that's nothing short of luxury.  Los Cabos - whenever I hear these 2 words I am going to think local, family restaurant with margaritas that are dripping at the stems and mysterious resemblances of dishes which they dub \"Mexican.\"   I will also picture myself being on the Biggest Loser because of the sheer portion sizes of the dishes here.  I guess it's either quality or quantity - and here it's definitely quantity.  

The standard bread basket is replaced with a basket of tortilla chips and salsa.  I really loved the spice they sprinkled on the chips, but the salsa was lacking in flavour.  Pack in some heat! 

My standard of measure at any Mexican restaurant are the fish tacos.  I ordered the Big Sur Fish Tacos which consists of 2 bland tacos on a heaping bed of rice and heaping scoop of refried beans.  Too much batter :p

One unique thing was the Margarita Wilson (made with white wine instead of tequila).  I ordered the peach one.  If there was any peach in it, I'd be surprised.  All I tasted was sugar and ice.  You probably could've served this to a 4 year-old and they would think that they were drinking juice.  Not to mention that the classy plastic cups they were served in were dripping from all corners of the cup.

I love Mexican food but this joint needs some serious work in the kitchen.  This place is what Manchu Wok is to Chinese food.  The service was friendly and the vibe was casual, but the food definitely disappointed."}
{"text":"Great weekend brunch menu. Very nice Mexican decor and the food was great as was the service. Very reasonably priced for the quality."}
{"text":"Tried this with my family, as I was in the mood for Mexican food. We had been to Mexico Lindo on two occasions and were not impressed. Unfortunately this trip to Los Cabos leaves us still looking for the quality authentic Mexican restaurant nearby. I had the 3 street Tacos, and they were soggy, and bland. My wife had the grilled fish taco is it was a wet mess also. I did have their cheese sticks, which were pretty good. Not sure if we caught them on an off day, but still needed to trek into Toronto to cure that Mexican craving."}
{"text":"A cute little restaurant with great food, great prices, and ambience. The service is quick and friendly. I had the enchiladas and they were full of flavour and the portion sizes are large. My boyfriend had the big sur fish tacos and he was quite pleased.

All in all, very authentic food along with great service. I will be making this my regular spot."}
{"text":"I was on my way to meet some friends at a Mexican restaurant in Whitby when they called and said the place was closed. We already in Whitby and had Mexican food on our minds so a quick search brought us to Los Cabos.

Our server brought us a complimentary bowl of nachos and salsa to start and we also ordered the guacamole. The guacamole was a bit bland but it was a lot better after we added some lemon juice, salt, pepper, and hot sauce.

For entrees, we ordered the Big D's Burrito Platter with beef, the Caribbean Mahi-Mahi, and the Ensenada Enchiladas with chicken. The enchiladas and burrito were huge portions! My companions said they tasted good.

I had the mahi-mahi and I had some issues with the dish. Some of the rice was crunchy, as in burnt. The fish \"filet\" had some bones in it. I know, it's fish, it can happen. Beyond the tropical salsa topping, however, the fish didn't have much flavour. It could have used more seasoning.

I probably won't be back for the food but if I'm in the area, I may drop in for drinks."}
{"text":"Great Mexican. Best I've had in Whitby. The portions they give are pretty generous so come with an appetite or be ready to take home some food. Decent pricing for Mexican food in canada. Great and fast service. Well worth the stop."}
{"text":"Great little Mexican place in the east GTA

Great service and pretty good food. The portion sizes were definitely filling. 
We ordered the Chicken Tacos which were delicious, the veggie enchiladas which were ok, and the Chicken Burrito which we \"Chimmied\" up which was also pretty good. 

Overall I would def recommend this place for it's good food, great service and chill atmosphere."}
{"text":"I'm writing this review after 2 visits. Los Cabos has a great patio, great selection of drinks including Margaritas etc and very quick and attentive service. Unfortunately, their grasp of Mexican food isn't top notch. The burritos are decent but on the dry side, the tortilla soup tasted horrible and isn't anywhere in the neighbourhood of what proper Mexican tortilla soup is supposed to be. Tortilla soup is typically a broth based lovely concoction of chicken, tortilla and cilantro but this version was like a very poor chili with awful flavor. I've never seen this version of tortilla soup before. 3 stars because the great setting and service is 5 star but the food is 1 star."}
{"text":"Los Cabos is a bright and fun little place hiding in plain site in  Whitby.

They have a great selection of Mexican inspired items ranging from the standard nachos and fajitas to fish tacos and more.

The owners are a husband and wife team, who are super nice people and you can tell they like there job and the place has a friendly and family feel.

Check it out!

(PS - Its right beside the Dairy Queen on Hwy 2)"}
{"text":"I have never had better salsa than the one served here. It is brought to your table with nachos upon entering the restaurant. The owners are most commonly the servers because it is a small place, and I like that. I usually order tacos and a strawberry daiquiri. The only thing I don't like so much is how many televisions there are, some people do like to watch sports during dinner though."}
{"text":"Visited awhile back with my wife. The dining room was empty but the bar was doing pretty good. Service was lackluster to say the least, for us being the only customers eating, service wasn't the greatest..The food although flavorful and well presented on the plate was more of an \"imitation\" Mexican food than authentic. I didn't have the shits the next day so in my opinion it wasn't that good."}
{"text":"I love all the renovations if they have done. I have been coming to this restaurant for years. The staff is always super friendly and have great suggestions. I would love to see the menu change that more often. I love the nachos that come for free when you sit down and order. It's always nice to start eating something right away when you're starving!"}
{"text":"Is it weird that I think my dish tasted like Taco Bell? I got something off the lunch specials, but I can't really remember what it was called. It was these two tacos with both hard and soft shell. Came with fries (there were other options too) and soda. I like Taco Bell, but this made me question the authenticity of the place. The portion and price were good though, and I felt myself being comfortably full after the meal. 

Nachos and salsa were complementary. I don't like nachos, but these were okay. 

There could also be better service. My waitress didn't really seem that interested in serving us, and I even felt that she was being a little rude (might just be a perception thing though). 

Strangely enough, even with all the complaints, I did enjoy the meal and I would come again. I guess it's the company that matters (I was with a large group)."}
{"text":"This place is a hidden gem! Great food and drinks, the restaurant is clean, and the owner is a cool guy."}
{"text":"So I decided to try this place because I was in the mood for a margarita and they didn't disappoint ...they were great!

They started us off with some chips and salsa and to my surprise they were really good... but I'm sure the margarita helped.  The menu had lots of unique Mexican/ California items to choose from.  It was a toss up between the fish tacos or the Big D.  I ended up with the Big D which is a burrito (normal or chimi style) served with rice, salad and re fried beans. It was great, lots of flavor, not to hot, not to mild.  The Big D was a massive burrito but of course I managed to clean my plate.  :-)

All in all, a great experience with good food, great margaritas and friendly staff.

Oh and a fair price.  3 margaritas and 2 entrées  = $53 (not bad at all)"}
