{"text":"Great, fresh food. Affordable, too. Friendly and clean.  Luckily, we live nearby so we go regularly."}
{"text":"Today is Valentine's Day, and my boyfriend and I decided to go to Lotus Sushi for dinner, only to find out that it has been replaced by Kiyo Sushi. So, we were thinking, \"Aww man, Lotus Sushi has been replaced, but why don't we give it a try anyway, since we're already here?\" 

The first thing we noticed was how horrible it was to understand the menu. Maybe all the other sections were ok, but the \"Kiyo Special Dinner\" section was so hard to understand. We had no idea what it came with. We asked the waitress and she had a strong accent, so you couldn't really understand her. We placed our order, and waited 15 mins for our MISO SOUP! Then another 10 mins for our ACTUAL dinner. While we were eating we noticed that our tempura didn't come with the sauce like Lotus Sushi. We kept on trying to get the waitress' attention, but she kept on ignoring us! Finally, after 10 mins of waiting for her (by now the tempera is already cold!) she asks us what we needed. My boyfriend asked her, \"Doesn't the tempura come with the sauce?\" instead of APOLOGIZING for not bringing the sauce, she said \"Yes.\" It was like, she knew that it came with the sauce, but didn't bother bringing it. After all this, we thought that it couldn't get any worse. Then our tea cups were completely empty, and she NEVER came by to refill it. Where as the owner of Lotus Sushi would ALWAYS come by once in awhile to ask if we would like refills! Oh my gosh, this place has THE WORSE service!

When we finally decided to leave, my boyfriend asked the waitress for the bill in a higher tone of voice, b/c she was near the back and he thought that she might not have heard him. What was funny was that the guy who was making the sushi asked my boyfriend if everything was ok, b/c apparently his tone of voice gave it away. My boyfriend said, \"I hope so......-__-\" The waitress brought the bill, and I asked her for a take-out box. She brought back just a box, with no bag. Sighhh! Seriously?! And to top it all off, they never gave us dessert -___-'

In the end, we didn't give them any tips. We paid $45 in total for crappy service and food that will never measure up to Lotus Sushi! I can't believe Lotus is gone :'( It was always me and my boyfriend's favourite, late night, go-to restaurant! It was sooo awesome! They gave us decent amount of food, at a decent price! This place is ridiculous, it was so pricey and they gave you so little food!

In conclusion, WE WILL NEVER BE GOING BACK!"}
{"text":"Recently re-branded (use to be Lotus Sushi) but things are still fairly similar. It does seem like there are new owners but I'm not too sure.

Menu has changed but there is still a good variety of bento boxes and sushi rolls/sashimi combos. On Monday-Thursday there are $15 specials.

I still think it's a bit pricey for what it is but reasonable, especially since there aren't many sushi places around this area! The food was decent and at least the rolls were not breaking apart. 

I would come here whenever I'm too lazy to drive south!"}
{"text":"My family and I love Kiyo because the sushi is always fresh, the family who runs the restaurant are always kind and we can tell they take pride in their quality food and preparation. There's never too much rice in their rolls and they have a lot of options for a quick lunch or take out for a party. 
We love supporting this local restaurant which we think is an undiscovered gem!"}
{"text":"We spontaneously decided to check out this sushi place, with my friend who was trying sushi for the 2nd time. We were pleasantly surprised and had an amazing experience. Not only was the sushi was amazing the waitress was very helpful. We really enjoyed the restaurant, the presentation and the atmosphere . If you are in the area I highly recommend to check this place out !!!

We ordered the fresh morning veggie sushi which had a mango after taste. Loved it!"}
{"text":"I frequent here for lunch, and am always satisfied with the quality of the salmon sashimi. It's fresh, well marbled and of course tasty! I usually get the salmon bento for lunch ($12.95) which comes with salmon sashimi, spicy crispy salmon rolls, japchae, and salmon sushi. Better quality salmon sashimi than even Mi Ne sushi nearby which is impressive. I've read the older reviews, and the service is excellent now. The waitress is very attentive and always one step ahead.

Definitely coming back again!"}
{"text":"Very clean and delicious sushi.
I got their seaweed salad , yako and blue ocean roll. 
They were all fresh and delicious. 
I will definitely come here again and order more take out!"}
{"text":"I have been to Kiyo Sushi several times and the food and service is always great. It is a family run business which offers Japanese and Korean food. The pricing for food is average (~ $10-$15 for lunch) but very worth it for the quality and portions. 

The 5 tempura and Red dragon roll that we ordered was delicious. the tempura was not overdone or too oily and had the perfect crunch to it. We also asked if they could change the tempura to just shrimp and broccoli and they gladly accommodated our request. 

The salmon bento box was also extremely delicious and fresh. It came with spicy salmon rolls, salmon sushi and salmon sashimi and japchae (Korean glass noodles). It didn't look like there was a lot of food in the box but as we got near the end, it was a lot more filling than it looks. 

Every time I have been here it has never been overly busy. It is great to go with friends and family. I would definitely recommend this place if you are looking for quality sushi at an affordable price."}
{"text":"I go to Kiyo Sushi at least twice a month and I have to say, over the few years or so that it has been here, it has become my go to sushi. I believe that it is a family run business and they are always very nice. I have never had any problem in terms of customer service and the food is excellent. I usually get the roll combos, which come with miso soup and green salad but I have also tried their bento boxes as well as some cooked food such as their gyoza, tempura, and jap chae. I usually end up spending around $10.50, before tax and tip. Their spicy mayonnaise is also great and it actually claims to have no real mayo, and I appreciate that being someone who is always looking for health conscious options. They do not use msg in their food either which is also a bonus. 

All in all, I really do recommend. The chef always says a thank you when you leave if he is present at the front and I always leave feeling satisfied."}
{"text":"Must give a five-star rating for the first sushi restaurant to win my family's heart (and stomachs). The service has always been friendly at this quaint, tiny location occupying a central spot in the plaza at Elgin Mills on the other side of Loblaws While I can't say that I've adored everything I've had here, there are certainly some maki rolls that Kiyo makes like no other joint I've been to - the crunch roll, for instance, is one that my sister and I like to order time and time again (only $5, too). Over the multiple times I've come here with mom, papa and the sis, I've also tried a bit of the chicken katsu bento box, the chicken teriyaki bento box, the jumbo dynamite roll, the chicken teriyaki (?) roll and the california roll. Kiyo's sushi is so soft and tasty - a real hidden gem in Richmond Hill, I'd say. The fifth star comes specifically because my family has been to many sushi places together and this one's attention to detail is perpetually impressive - the cute orange slices for dessert, peppy servers and generally calm / soothing ambiance are more than enough to outweigh a bit more expensive than what I am accustomed to."}
{"text":"I've been to Kiyo Sushi once, the food was amazing. The fish was fresh and the tempura was crisp. Service was fast and great. Will go again when I'm in the area."}
{"text":"I became a sushi lover person after I first tried this place. They have awesome + delicious + fresh sushi and their place is nice and clean. I miss this place a lot whenever I'm out of Richmond Hill. 10/10 recommend"}
{"text":"My favorite sushi restaurant in Richmond Hill. Excellent quality and reasonably priced. Always plenty of parking."}
{"text":"Sadly location has closed and was replaced by a Ramen noodle restaurant"}
{"text":"I have been to Kiyo Sushi for lunch and dinner, I have wonderful experience both time I was there.

Lunch Special starting at $7.95 with some different combination bento boxes. My Sushi Combo ($10.95) was impressive both in the freshness of fish and the well prepared shari rice! A selection and even includes 2 pieces of Aburi sushi!

Chirashi ($12.95) at dinner which is listed as an Appetizer is no Appetizer. I didn't expect much as this price point and I was surprised and delighted when it was served to me! What a huge order with a great combination of sashimi!! I can eat this everyday.....

Kiyo Sushi is small family run business with really friendly and polite service. Price is so reasonable and I can't wait to go back again to have Chirashi again soon!!"}
{"text":"Whoa, whoa. So. Good!! I'm so fortunate to have stumbled upon here while looking for another restaurant. Luckily I already had an idea as to what this place might be like since hearing about it just a day prior from another friend so there was no hesitation in trying it out. 

I couldn't help but order basically what caught my eyes as soon as I flipped open their menu. They have a large selection of rolls, combination of different rolls, and appetizers. They also have a nice selection of sashimi. 

I ended up getting an 8 piece shrimp tempura to start with, then the small dinner sashimi set, and then finally the Orangeville roll. I'm not even kidding when I say this but sashimi has got to be the freshest I've tried! Each piece practically melted in my mouth and they were so sweet, I'm definitely coming back soon. The roll was amazing, not too much rice and plenty of other goodies, mark me as impressed. Tempura was all right but that's expected. You can't go wrong with that.

Service was great; the restaurant wasn't busy at all so quick and efficient are words to describe it. Definitely coming back!"}
