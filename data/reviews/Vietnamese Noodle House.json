{"text":"I liked here because there were not much customer in the store. Well actually, one was there but she left soon so it was me alone. Very quite and cozy. And the price for the food was moderate! Had chicken noodle and deep fried shrimp spring rolls and i'm pretty pleased when i finished the meal :)"}
{"text":"Oh my god. Excellent food and very affordable. Will definitely be going back again and again. Also, the way they packed my food to go was super. No spills and everything was just the right temp. But they have ample seating as well.
Bought four spring rolls, and two soups and it fed three grown ups and two small kids. The broth was fragrant and wonderful and everything was just perfect.
Don't let the plain exterior or crazy intersection keep you away. Park at the bank or get off the bus and get some Pho."}
{"text":"I've been here three times for take-out only. During the summer, the place is very hot, they have a portable AC (not designed for an open space) so it cant cool anything, and some fans. However, the food is great and the service is friendly (family run, nice people). I love the spring rolls and dishes 17 and 21."}
{"text":"plse please excuse me If I spelled vietn---- wrong! These guys cook & cook & cook!! amazing vermicelli; veg & meat wowed my head off! super service. don't let that busy streetcorner stop you if you want a snack or meal- Great smoothies too!  the only reason i didn't give 5 stars is too many soup categories.. you prob. don't care."}
