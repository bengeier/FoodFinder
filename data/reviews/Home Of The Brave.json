{"text":"WAYYYYY too much hype about this place!! Seriously though... No seriously.   Only good thing about this place is how they are good at making the portions look decent in the photos lol  Service:  the waitress was no offense an airhead she was so distracted looking around at people seemed to have a bad case of ADHD  She knew nothing about her drinks list or about the food ... Was gone when we kept trying to order more food (we had to order with the bar back because she took so long to show up)    FOOD:  Tater tots :  meh not worth it  Cauliflower app: meh over cooked and nothing special  Corn bread: alright but really not worth it .... Unless you are feeding tweety bird.    Kentucky handshake sandwich: not worth the price (it's literally Kentucky fried chicken ... Like might as well go there and pay $6 instead of basically $15 to look at some arm ) lol   Chicken and Waffles : portion is not worth it flavor was alright nothing mind blowing (go to the Kensington market one ... WAYYY better and much more for your money)    Red Funnel cake : save your money .... Tiny over cooked and completely over drizzled with icing ... Yuck  worst thing I have ever had in the funnel cake department.   We ordered more food but honestly don't waste your time ... Just go somewhere else.... Not worth even going on about how bad it was."}
{"text":"Came here with a group of 5, shared a bunch of food and everything was very underwhelming. The portions are tiny (especially for the price) and the quality is subpar. Had the Tuna Poke bowl, which was so over salted I couldn't even eat half. The tater tots tasted like powdered potatoes fried up. The only redeeming plate was the chicken and waffles, which was also a very small portion for the price. If you're looking for a fun place to drink, this could be a good option but I wholeheartedly recommend skipping the food all together."}
{"text":"Great drink menu. These gents really do a great job connecting to a hipster/americana vibe. Not a big fan of the food. A little too rich for me. Overall a good experience."}
{"text":"Their slushies will knock you on your ass. Get them. Then see if you can drink more than 3. One's rum and one's gin. Also get the deep fried cauliflower. If you hate cauliflower and you don't get it just because of that reason, then you're a loser and you're missing out big time and you should learn to try new things. If you don't get this because all you like is pizza and you have a severe food aversion...then go see a doctor because I'm sorry, but you have a problem. Chicken and waffles are obviously crazy good, but their fries are the real deal. Get those or you won't be able to finish 3 of the slushies.  Best to be there in the summer. Vibe's a lot funner and everyone wears less clothing when its warm."}
{"text":"Food: 3/5 Atmosphere: 4.5/5 Service: 4/5  Food: Buffalo Cauliflower: Average. Nothing special, but still good. Tater tots: Very good, but you can't go wrong with tater tots and cheese. Chicken and Waffles: Flavour was good, chicken wasn't too dry and the waffles were crispy on the outside and fluffy on the inside. Not my favourite fried chicken though. Definitely worth a try. Steak and Collard Greens: Enjoyed this the most, the steak wasn't over cooked or dry, was done medium rare, went well with the collard greens.  Kentucky Handshake Sandwich: looked awesome, but was a disappointment. The chicken was a little dry, needed to be flavoured with hot sauce. The piece of chicken came with what looked like chicken feet, which I believe was supposed to make the dish different from others, but it just made it awkward for me to eat the burger.   Drinks: Good selection of whiskey.  Atmosphere: I loved it, just a casual bar restaurant. It gets pretty loud, which is expected at a bar. It's a small place though, minimal standing area. It's easier to get there earlier to get a table or booth, especially on the weekends.   Service: Very good. We had a table of 8, and some people had to leave early. They couldn't split the bill, but they didn't have a problem calculating what each person owed.  Final thoughts: Go back for the bar atmosphere, don't really care for the food. Although I still want to try their funnel cake."}
{"text":"This review is based purely on the ice cream. We had the cinnamon crunch and the flutter butter. Both so good, must try!!"}
{"text":"I would give this place 4.5 stars. The food was *really good*, the service was ridiculously fast, and the place is decorated nicely, specifically the bar area.   We ordered the buffalo cauliflower, tater tots, and my boyfriend had the fried bologna sandwich for himself. He thought it was \"fucking awesome\" as he told the waitress, and he's a pretty hard sell at restaurants. The tater tots were like little puffs of heaven that were topped with Parmesan cheese and sitting in a touch of gravy in a skillet. The cauliflower was amazingly not oily and greasy and came with homemade ranch and hot sauce. Note: the ranch sauce has dill in it, but it was a nice touch. I so wish I had room for the red velvet funnel cake (as I absolutely love red velvet), but I'll have to go back for that.   The server was a delight and like I said, the service was also fast. Almost as soon as we placed our order, the food was coming out. That probably had to do with the fact that we eat with the early birds and were there around 5:30 when they only opened a half hour earlier.   I only docked half a star because the music was a little loud and we both found it to be pretty hot in there. But overall, we really enjoyed ourselves and are happy to have found a place that's great and is nice and close. Oh, and the prices? Very reasonable."}
{"text":"I am a foodie and have lived downtown for almost 20 years now so I've tried A LOT of restaurants around the city.  This has to be one of the WORST.  $85 for a dinner for 2 (one cocktail each, no dessert) is completely unreasonable for the level of food they serve.  The salt level was so high on everything ordered that the food was inedible.  We had to send ALL of it back.    The servers were kind but inexperienced, they apologized and said they would notify the kitchen but nothing was done to rectify the situation.  There was no explanation, nothing was replaced, and nothing was taken off the bill.  We were essentially charged for a meal that we didn't and couldn't eat.  I suspect that all the salt is added to account for the lack of depth of flavour in their food, but it just makes it worse.  If I want a great burger, fried chicken, or bbq, I'll be going back to The Stockyards instead!  I would even take McDonalds over this place.  If you just want to go for a beer after work then it's fine and the music is decent.  As for the cocktails, you're much better off going to BarChef or the County General.  It should really be called Home of the Salt Lick.  Proceed with caution fellow Yelpers!"}
{"text":"Great location,awesome vibe, delicious food, tasty drinks! What more could you ask for?  Just wished they didn't run out of some of the food options on the menu! :(   Other then that, I had a FAB time! Would definitely return!   Last thing, if loud music isn't your thing, you may want to think twice about what type of place you want to head to for your outing...The music is particularly loud at night but I loved it! Totally my thing! To each their own I guess!!  My dinner?: Zombie slushie, crab-cake salad, fried Bologna sandwich! YUMMMMY"}
{"text":"I just had the chicken and waffles. They were tasty but at $16 I expect to get a bit more bang for my buck. Especially in an area of the city with so much  competition.  I won't rush back. Same for the handshake sandwich."}
{"text":"After a long day at the aquarium we stumbled onto home of the brave which I've been dying to try    Unfortunately it did not live up to all the hype in my opinion.   The atmosphere is awesome. Fun decor and fun staff. However the food was just ok. Tater tots were good, nothing special. The fried chicken was almost....too crispy? I know it's weird but it was almost hard to chew. And very very sweet. So if you like really crispy sweet chicken and waffles you will like this but it wasn't for us. Burger was very very simple and came with no fries, no salad, no side at all which sucked. Not a great beer selection, I think they are trying to push cocktails.   Overall, not too impressed but by no means was it awful."}
{"text":"This place was awful.  Our server was in inattentive and, frankly, uninterested.  We went for a birthday celebration and it was terrible. This is a pretend Brooklyn knock-off  joint with THE  WORST service and mediocre American casual food. The \"Kentucky Handshake\" is nothing but a gimmicky chicken sandwich with a foot sticking out. Guess what? If your fried chicken sandwich is good you have no need for a gimmick. Mine came bloody in the middle - I pointed this out and sent it back and the waiter told me that I could reorder but  it would come back rare in the middle again \"because that's how thighs are served\". I work in catering. Bloody chicken is NEVER an option. I would rant on, but I think this place will sink itself before someone contracts salmonella."}
{"text":"FOOD: 4/5  Tater tots: 4.5/5  Crispy on the outside, creamy on the inside. The cheese on top is the perfect compliment.  Bologna Sandwich: 4.5/5  May give you a heart attack, but is damn good! Homemade processed cheese (what?), fried bologna and pistachios. Sounds weird, tastes fucking awesome. Only reason it gets 4.5 is cause it was a bit salty and I felt my arteries clogging as I ate it.  Handshake Fried Chicken: 4/5  Good fried chicken sandwich, but the chicken itself could use a bit more seasoning. The hot sauce on the side is essential. Also had a couple bitches were it was just batter, which wasn't pleasant. Pretty good though.  Broccoli and Grits: 3/5  Brocolli was tasty, but the grits were too greasy and lacked flavour. Didn't finish this dish.  Lobster Roll: 3/5  Meh. A good lobster roll, but nothing special. Rock Lobster puts this roll to shame.  Red Velvet Funnel Cake: 2.5/5  Meh. Sounds great, but the batter is really chewy and they put too much white sauce on top of it. The ice cream is awesome. But I'd take the Wonderland funnel cake over this any day, which is kind of sad.  Zombie Frozen Slushie (alcoholic): 4/5  Very strong and really tasty. An adult Slushie for sure, strong Rum taste. Wouldn't order more than one, though.  SERVICE: 5/5  Waitress was very attentive, kept your glasses of water full, and paced the meal according to our request (we didn't want everything at the same time). She also checked in after every couple dishes to see if we liked them. Wiped down the table mid-meal and didn't rush us to leave even as the restaurant got busy. Couldn't ask for more.  AMBIANCE: 3.5/5  For a meal like this, ambiance is not the reason you are coming. That being said, it was a cool spot, but the music was a bit too loud. Got annoying after awhile.  VERDICT: 4/5  Great food and great service. Still thinking about the Bologna sandwich. Will be back again!"}
{"text":"Great atmosphere Great comfort food with a twist Great selection of Bourbon....you know this place is good when Blantons is readily available. too bad it wasn't bigger, Love the balcony"}
{"text":"PARTIAL REVIEW.... Jack & Coke Slushie, Zombie Slushie: Three Types of Rum, Grapefruit, Pineapple, Bitters, Cinnamon Syrup, 'Tis the Saison : Bourbon, Peach, Rosemary, Saison ($12), Summer in Sakon : Thai Spiced Vodka, Pineapple, Ginger Beer, Lime ($12) First of all, if you want to get shickered, then go for the slushies first. Wow. Those babies are loaded with the good stuff and surprisingly not too sweet. In contrast, the Tis the Saison tasted much more subtle and delicate, while the Sakon offered a nice kick of heat. If you like ginger beer (I love the stuff), then you'll definitely want to check the Sakon out. In theme with the rest of the HOTB brand, the food is unmistakably American. Generous portions of calorie-loaded favourites delivering a one way ticket to flavourtown (yes, I just quoted a man with bleach blond hair who wears shades on the back of his head). But no, seriously, folks, a peek at the 18 item menu and you'll feel as though you're on a road trip through the good ol' U-S of A.  Fried chicken, fried bologna, fried tater tots, fried funnel cake. Ladies and gents, this is not the place to bring a lady (or man) who's respectfully watching their weight. And I mean, I kinda' watch mine (most days...), but that wasn't going to stop me from digging in hard. Now, to be fair, there were some salads and veggie sides the menu, but I couldn't bring myself to order beets when the meaty bones were staring at me.  This is what went in my mouth that unapologetically gluttonous night.  Kentucky Fried Handshake Sandwich : Fried Chicken, Mayo, Iceberg Lettuce, Louisiana Hot Sauce ($13) Loved the presentation (chicken foot anyone?), and the flavour was right on. The chicken was juicy inside and well seasoned, with a wickedly crunchy batter holding it all in. At first bite I thought that the sandwich could have maybe used a touch more mayo but once I added a good dousing of hot sauce, there was more than enough flavour to go around.   Bones in a Bucket : Kansas City Rubbed Beef & Pork Ribs, Ranch Dressing, Pickled Celery & Carrot ($18)- I definitely preferred the succulent pork ribs to their beef cousins, which were a little more fatty and therefore, harder to eat in their entirety. Having said that, I found the rib rub nicely balanced and not too cloyingly sweet and I loved that they served their veggies pickled on the side to cut the fat of the ribs. I actually kind of like that they serve the beef and pork ribs together, because some people in parties love pork ribs (like me), and some people don't eat pork (like a lot of my Jewish friends). Order a bucket of bones, share amongst different-minded people, and you might just make some friends!  Buffalo Cauliflower : Beer Battered Cauliflower, Louisiana Hot Sauce, Ranch Dressing ($7) I ordered this to kind of \"round out\" the meat- heavy meal, and I totally fell in love. Cauliflower to me is probably one of the most boring vegetables there are, but for some reason when they're battered like this they actually taste like meat! The texture has a good meaty density, and because they're so neutral in flavour, they soak up all the delicious hot sauce and ranch. Super addictive.  Johnny Cake with Smoked Trout : Cornmeal Griddle Cake with Savoury Cream, Smoked Trout, Maple Syrup & Chives ($14) The best dish of the night. Wow. If you like the combination of sweet and savoury flavours, then order this and thank me later. Similar to a pancake, but with a more chewy texture and nutty flavour from the cornmeal, the Johnny Cake is a Rhode Island and New England breakfast or side dish staple. It arrived absolutely drunk off sticky maple syrup, with a generous slab of salty smoked trout, and a massive dollop of rich fluffy cream. Oh lordy...We actually fought over each bite- yep, this stuff is good enough to cause break ups   Tater Tots : Crispy Potatoes, Cheese, Gravy & Herbs ($5) Another pretty addictive little bite. Unlike the tater tots I shamefully remember as a child which were more hard batter than potato, these babies were potato-forward with a light ethereal crunch. They actually were almost closer to big gnocchi that had been pan or flash fried.  I could have maybe liked a little more cheese flavour, but they were absolutely delicious nontheless. Yum   Red Velvet Funnel Cake : Bourbon Vanilla Bean Ice Cream, Orange Cream Cheese Drizzle, Macerated Berries ($7) if you have fond memories of going to the fair for funnel cake, then this is the dessert for you.  I liked the deep cocoa flavour in the cake against the bright tangy cream cheese drizzle and the buttery smooth bourbon ice cream. It was childhood but just a little more drunk. I loved it. ...."}
{"text":"Just stopped in for a dinner and was absolutely blown away. In a nutshell, a fun atmosphere with very tasty comfort food. Had the ribwich, one of the best sandwiches I have ever had. The short rib was perfect. Definitely will be back."}
{"text":"I will be going back and I highly recommend it!  Amazing food (bologna sandwich and chicken and waffles was fantastic) music is sooooooo good and dessert was awesome (ice cream sandwich)  Waiting for a table is annoying but this place is worth a try!"}
{"text":"The decor- if you like grand electric, well this place looks just like that and all the other hipster joints. The music was somewhat loud at 6pm when we got there. By 7 it was so loud we had to almost yell to hear one another. Why is it \"cool\" to have the music so loud that you can't even have a normal conversation? The banquets looked comfortable but I sat in one of their terrible, rock hard chairs.  Food- we both had the chicken and waffles. The chicken was really good, juicy, well seasoned, with a crunchy coating. The waffles however, were as my friend joked, \"not even as good as Eggo\". He was right, they may be made in-house, but they tasted about 3 hours old. It could be a great dish but the staleness ruined it. The serving size was a bit too big and since it came with no vegetables, it forced us to add a side of brussel sprouts. Ironically these ended up being the star of the night with a creamy, smooth mourney sauce with a tangy, smokey(?) cheese, topped with crunchy mustard seeds.  Drinks- I had a Well traveled, it tasted a bit unbalanced, my friend had the bourbon and root beer. He drank about two sips and had enough, I tried it and it tasted like medicine. Not a winning combo. Price- the food is reasonable with most mains in the 12-16 range. The mixed drinks are all $12 and weren't that great, nor of any relevance to the dishes. Stick to the cheaper beer or pop.  Overall- mixed bag, has that exciting/annoying hipster vibe (depends what you like). We didn't try many dishes but allowing stale crappie waffles into a dish hints at some issues in the kitchen.  Repeat visit? Maybe, but maybe not. There are just too many other options in T.O"}
{"text":"Check this place out for tasty food with good portions; my dining companion and I were able to split a sandwich (pork belly), salad (crab cake), and side (beets) and neither of us felt like we needed more food.    The salad was awesome: Asian-inspired, with peanuts and green beans topped with a poached egg and a crab cake.  The pork belly was a fork-and-knife sandwich, piled high with pork and coleslaw.  Far too messy to eat by hand!  Service was great; we had our drinks refilled frequently and the food came to our table quickly, but it felt kind of rushed--the staff cleared each plate the second it looked like we might be done with it and gave us our check as soon as we declined drinks or dessert.  The place was way too loud for us to linger, anyway--it was impossible to hear any conversation beyond \"Wow, this is yummy!\"  It's a fun place for drinks (the cocktail menu is very inventive), but I wouldn't come back for dinner."}
{"text":"My rating scale can be found at the bottom of all my reviews.  The Review:  I've been to Home of the Brave a handful of times. Every experience has been pleasant. The food is tasty and unique. Almost every dish has some sort of hook that will keep you coming back for more.   The cornbread is a must order. I try cornbread at every restaurant and I am pretty sure this is the best I've had in the city. Sitting in a small layer of melted cheese sauce this little loaf of cornbread comes to your table almost camouflaged under a layer of toppings. The experts at Home of the Brave skirt the line of overpowering the dish by giving you the absolute most amount of bacon and green onions they can. Even if you aren't a huge cornbread fan I still suggest you try their take on this Southern classic.  If you are a cauliflower fan, the Buffalo cauliflower is another great dish. The serving size is huge so make sure you share it with one or two others. This brings to light something Home of the Brave is great at, serving size. Most appetizers are big enough for at least two and some can double as an entree. This makes it a great place to grab a few drinks and a snack while listening to some great music.   Home of the Brave is a great place to bring someone who isn't overly adventurous with their food choices because on the surface, most choices can sound like your basic pub fare, but as they will soon fall in love with, there is nothing basic about Home of the Brave's menu.  Rating Scale:  5 Stars: I crave eating here. The best of the best! It's the type of place I'd bring out-of-towners to. I talk about this place to anyone I meet. This is always an option when I'm looking to go out for dinner.  4 Stars: I love eating here. I will tell friends and family about this place and may even bring them to eat here. Possibly needs a particular taste or an open mind.  3 Stars: I don't mind eating here. This may be a more generic place but still an enjoyable meal. I may have had a small bad experience here. I usually won't go here unless invited or for any event of some kind.  2 Stars: I probably will never eat here again. I won't go out of my way to tell people not to eat here but if they ask me I will share my thoughts. One glaring fault will bring it down to this rating.  1 Star: I will actively tell people not to eat here. It's very hard to get a 1 star because some places can just have an off night due to a multitude of reasons. Multiple glaring faults have to occur to drop this low."}
{"text":"My brother and I ate here during the holiday season and we both got sick with food poisoning the next day.  It took us both 5 days to recover.  We literally both went through hell (headache, fever, vomiting, diarrhea, chills).  I called the restaurant to let them know what had happened, they apologized and said the manager would call me back the next day but they never did.  I guess I should have expected as much from a restaurant who's food is much more about appearance and gimmicks than actual taste (much like the owners other restaurant sweet Jesus).  If you like good food then don't go here, if you're still too stubborn to heed my warning then avoid the buffalo cauliflower bites or the chicken wings, cause these are the dishes my brother and I shared!"}
{"text":"I'm from the states and I felt that this food was a fun way to remember the comfort food of Atlanta where I'm from. Not too pricey and my only real complaint was that at 8 PM they had the music (good hip hop music though) up way too loud. I had to really concentrate on my date so that I didn't get distracted by the music. So maybe this isn't the best place to take a date? Never the less, I loved the food and the service was awesome."}
{"text":"The place is close to us so we wanted to try for a while.... It lived up to the expectation, comfort food with lively atmosphere. There is a wait on weekend nights(not sure about weekdays). The place is very small so most ppl stayed at the bar first...  The food were really tasty and drinks were okay... A bit on the sweet side. Would def want to come back and try more things..!"}
{"text":"Great place to get together with a few friends - the atmosphere is lively, the drinks are delicious and the service is fast and friendly. And if that is not enough, they have an assortment of Sweet Jesus desserts.  The servers were attentive and prompt, and the food was served rather quickly. They had a variety of unexpected drinks listed on the menu. Everyone tried something different and they all managed to please the crowd. We ordered to share: Buffalo Cauliflower (cannot go wrong, it tastes like chicken but its actually cauliflower), Cornbread (very well done, and a tad spicy. I thoroughly enjoyed the small kick of flavour), Chicken Waffles (as you can probably tell from the other reviews it is a MUST have), and finally the Philly Cheesesteak (it was delicious, but not quite as good as something you'd get in Philadelphia).  All in over, cannot wait to be back."}
{"text":"Everything was really good, nice waiters, as you'd expect hip decor and accoutrements.  The drink menu was great, we sat at the bar for an hour waiting for our table so got to try a couple and see a lot more being made. But seriously, expect a wait.  We split, the cauliflower, sprouts, Waldorf, tots, bologna, and crab cakes. Everything was delicious but Everything is very heavy. Either fried, saucy, cheesy - So the above was too much for two people. Still it was all delicious comfort food - I can't deny that."}
{"text":"I went here with a big group (8-10 people) for dinner and it was pretty full for a rainy Tuesday night. The restaurant is on the second floor with a bar and a balcony view of King St. The décor is grunge-y Americana, with black walls and American cities and slogans in white paint. The music was great, they played a lot of LCD Soundsystem and hip hop remixes when we were there. As other commenters have said, the music was a little loud for a restaurant, but about right for a bar.  The menu was very simple with an emphasis on Southern comfort food. I got the Kentucky Fried Handshake Sandwich which comes with a claw attached. I didn't realize until about half way during eating it that you were supposed to cut it off with the supplied knife. The claw isn't really edible so it comes off as a gimmick rather than a genuine value-add. Anyway, the chicken was delicious was a perfect combination of crunchy on the outside and juicy on the inside. The bun and toppings were standard fare that didn't add or take away from the chicken. I was pleasantly surprised by the hot sauce that came with the sandwich. Most similar Americana restaurants only offer Frank's Red Hot Sauce or some other generic sauce that tastes more sweet than spicy. This one was actually spicy and flavourful, and really enhanced the sandwich.   Overall a great restaurant and I definitely want to come back to try some of the more exotic menu items."}
{"text":"Great all around, except for the the chairs. Menu is small but that has a benefit of the restaurant being good/great at a few dishes rather than mediocre at 40. Had the Cheese & Brussel Sprouts, Ribs and Steak & Collards. All of them were excellent. The steak & collards was pretty salty but still delicious.   The service was over the top which for me good service can make up for \"okay\" food. Servers work together. Our table was wiped in between dishes. Water cups were filled for us.   Went on a Monday night and it was slow which was likely to be our benefit. Definitely recommend this place."}
{"text":"I saw the bearded bartender take a hair out of the beer he had just poured and serve it to me. Offering no explanation or apology."}
{"text":"visiting overnight with the kids and we often find the hip restaurants are not family friendly.  I never get that attitude because these kids are potential customers in a few years.  Thankfully Home of the Brave was very accommodating and our Waitress Cassandra went out of her way to make our two girls feel welcome.  The food is creative, fresh, fun and inexpensive. We shared a few apps - deep fried cauliflower, Brussels sprouts in cheese, a couple of baskets of home cut fries. For mains a nice chicken and waffles, and the burger specials. The back bar is well stocked but the draft beer selection is weak.  that is really my only complaint.  We are definitely making this a regular stop when we visit TO.     jay"}
{"text":"Long story short, this restaurant provided the worst customer experience I've ever had. The staff was not helpful and offered no solutions to our situation. My favourite part was when the manager reminded us that \"this is downtown Toronto\". We ended up not even getting our food. The service we experienced shows why Toronto gets a bad name!"}
{"text":"Really good food. Bad music. Atrocious service except the bartender. We had about a $320 tab, paid cash, and then stopped after we left because they said we shorted them $100. Seriously?"}
{"text":"After hearing about this place for so long we decided to check it out last Sunday. There were 5 of us and we ordered 5 different dishes. Very disappointed in all of them. The chicken waffals was disgustingly cold..horrible taste. I had a bit and that's it. It took them less than 5 minutes after we order to bring out food so I kinda think it was sitting in their fridge. But even the taste was really bad. Ribs were low quality. The burger was even worse. They didn't mention that they make their burgers medium rare which I find so rare. Due to health saftey most of the places serve burgers well done or medium well. If they don't, they would tell you or have it written in the menue. The phylly cheese steak was also nothing special. Overall I was very very disappointed in the food and I don't understand why people make a big deal ou t if this place. I should also mention that thr staff was nice and they didn't charge us for the chicken waffals and they brough t us  medium well burger. Overall the food is really bad."}
{"text":"Came here for dinner on a Friday night. The restaurant was pretty busy at 6pm but we were seated right away. By the time we left there was a line up at the door and the bar area was very crowded! I thought this place was okay. Nothing really stood out - besides the decor and vibe. Based on reviews, we ordered the cauliflower bites. I was underwhelmed. There was nothing special at all about it. The bucket of ribs which is a combo of pork and beef ribs was okay as well. The beef ribs were good - very tender but the pork ribs were not great.  Kind of tough and definitely too much fat vs meat.   The philly cheese steak was good but very very greasy and salty. I liked the bread. Glad we checked this place out as it's been on my list for a while. I couldn't see myself returning."}
{"text":"The buffalo cauliflower is the BOMB! It is so addictive with the sauce and just fried goodness.. I could eat two portions of these on my own. It's really the only thing worth getting on the menu . The brussels sprouts - nothing to get excited about.   Chicken and waffles and the fried chicken sandwich- decent. Hard to get it wrong.  The cocktails are delicious and draft beer selection- small but interesting.. so overall pretty good."}
{"text":"Amazing food and great friendly service. Loved the vibe. Great cocktails (Long Island slushy a must!)"}
{"text":"Average at best. I had the philly steak and chicken and waffles. The chicken and waffles were way too sweet and the philly steak was just gross. The homemade ice tea was alright. I wouldn't go back."}
{"text":"They have really good drinks like, princess  peach and their burgers are amazing! The ambience is nice and they play good music! Service is excellent staff are super friendly"}
{"text":"Great atmosphere, service. Went for the Valentines Day menu. Great dishes. Unique. Will definitely return for normal menu."}
{"text":"Service was excellent (very friendly and prompt), unfortunately the food could've been better.  Meal-wise, the night started off with a bang.  We got the tater-tots to start, which were perfectly fried and light.  It was then followed by the Ribwich, Brussels sprouts and the Alterboy burger.  The Alterboy burger was well made and the meat was absolutely tender.  The Ribwich was just alright, once again the meat was tender but all you could taste was the rib honey jus (a little overpowering).  Lastly the Brussels sprouts were disappointing.  The Brussels sprouts are drowned in a cheese sauce that is extremely rich and preferably would be better off separated.  Overall I would go back for the tater tots but I would definitely avoid the Brussels sprouts."}
{"text":"Definitely a trendy place. I tried the chicken and waffles, brussels sprouts and tater tots with my boyfriend. One main and two sides were definitely enough for two people to share. It was my first time trying chicken and waffles and I was impressed by how well the dish blended together, likely because of the syrup that came on it, but I would have preferred to choose the amount of syrup myself (there was way too much on and it was too sweet), and the chicken could have been crispier. The tater tots were okay. The Brussels sprouts were the best thing about the meal. Service was fine. We managed to come when it wasn't too busy (about an hour after opening on a very cold weekend). The space is very cool -- I think the cool factor is probably this restaurant's best asset. I might come back, but probably won't because the prices are a bit too high and there are so many other places to try."}
{"text":"Amazing.  The Brussel sprouts are good, the chicken waffles great but the home of the brave burger stole the show.  It is transcendent in its subtle flavours.  The ice creams cones are fun and sinful.  The server was sweet and brought extra favs.  I am so impressed and will absolutely return.  Yum!"}
{"text":"I finally got the chance to dine after seeing bunch of pictures of their food from instagram. I convinced two of my friends to join with me and we were not disappointed!! We were lucky to got there before there rush came cause when we were done the restaurant was packed already and I wasn't surprise why!! The food was beyond amazing!! My friends and I ordered different entrées and two sides to share.. we all shared portions of our food so that each of us could get a taste of each entrée. My friends ordered chicken waffle and fried bologna, and I ordered ribwich. We also ordered freedom fries and deep fried cauliflower.  All that we ordered was amazing!! I like the sauces that came with our fries and deep fried cauliflower.. the ribwich that I ordered was really juicy and tender. I ate all of it and want more!! The best of all was the fried bologna sandwich!! It's hard to explain why lol you really have to try it to know what I mean!! The price point of our food was reasonable!! Additionally, the service was exceptional!! We didn't have to tell the server how we want to separate our bill!! Plus, i also like the homey, rustic ambience of the place. The only small thing thaf I was disappointed about is that they dont have the smore's ice cream sandwich that I really want to try :( but its not really a big deal.  Overall, this place is definitely worth it to try!!"}
{"text":"Rude bartender ruined the evening. I explained to him that this was my first visit. His response was that I had a \"boring life\". Weird response from a staff member and unacceptable behavior. The waiter didn't explain the menu whatsoever and stared at us with a blank stare when it was time to take our order.   That aside. The food was not bad but certainly not good. The amount of grease and general fried nature of everything made everything basically taste the same.   Many much better restaurants in this area."}
{"text":"I follow sweetjesus on instagram and have been wanting to try one of their cones for quite some time. Right now it's only available at HOTB or La Carnita. Cool place to have dinner. It had good music playing (hip hop) but the booth was pretty tight and uncomfortable.  I ordered the Ribs, tater tots, brussel sprouts, and ice cream cone (peanut butter epi pen).  Chince portions for the food, nothing to write home about.  The cone did not disappoint... I wanted to order another it was that good."}
{"text":"Beared the cold last night and came to Home of the Brave with my friend. We arrived at 6PM and it was still moderately busy considering the horrible weather earlier and  it's a Wednesday night. Our server was very attentive and patient when I asked her for food recommendation.  My friend had the daily special which was the Chicago style pizza. It's pretty well made, but the tomato taste was a bit overpowering for my liking. I ordered the chicken and waffles, and I have to say it's the best chicken and waffles I've ever had. The chicken was fried really well - crispy on the outside, and super tender on the inside, coupled with the sauce mixed with the perfect amount of sweetness = delish heaven. To end the dinner, we shared a red velvet funnel cake, which tastes a lot better than it looked. I see other reviewers have posted better looking funnel cake from this restaurant though. So I'm not sure what happened with the presentation there.   Overall pretty decent food, nice decor, good services. AND it's conveniently located. Will come again."}
{"text":"Home of the Brave seems to be the new popular hangout spot on King West. We had to go elsewhere a couple times already due to 1 hour + wait times but were finally able to get seated and try their amazing food and cocktails this past Saturday.   We got the Manhattan and a tequila cocktails. Both were well made but on the pricier side. For food, we got the taters (must order!!) and the kentucky handshake sandwich and the fried bologna sandwich. The fried bologna sandwich was nothing special.   Bottomline - Fun hangout spot on King West if you dont have to wait to get seated :)"}
{"text":"Date Visited: August 23, 2013  Home of the Brave is a newly opened classic American eatery by the people behind La Carnita. Their slogan: Why can't Canucks make American food?  Reservation policy - drop by and leave a number (for parties less than 10).   My fellow foodies and I went to check on HOTB on Friday night.  We showed up a quarter before eight and we were greeted with a one hour wait.  We decided to wait and see what all the fuss was about.   Once seated, we took a look at the drinks menu. Surprise, surprise - everything was American inspired from vintage American cocktails (Blinker, Bronx, Honeymoon) to guest book cocktails (The Manhattan, The Wizard of Oz).  They also had beer by the bottle. I got a can of Pabst Blue Ribbon ($5).   For my main, I ordered the Fried Bologna Sandwich ($9.00). I love how thinly the bologna was sliced like a deli sandwich.  I've never seen bologna presented this way - it's the most refined I've seen it. It's not the juvenile, thick sliced, bottom rung of the cold cut ladder luncheon meat that I am used to - that's for sure!  On top of that, the bologna was fried, browned here and there for some great texture.  The bologna had a good flavour to it except that it was on the salty side. The sandwich's saving grace?  Those toasted pistachios. They balanced out the saltiness of the meat and gave the sandwich an amazing crunch factor. The pistachios elevated the sandwich to another level.  Also having melted house made American cheese and spicy sour cream on this bad boy was the right call.   We also ordered the Johnny Cake with Smoked Trout ($14.00): cornmeal griddle cake with savoury cream trout, maple syrup and chives.   This dish played with sweet and salty elements. The perfect bite - sweet yet crunchy Johnny cake with savoury trout and a dab of cream. Great taste experience. Yet, it did get too sweet after letting the Johnny cake soak up more of the maple syrup at the bottom of the dish.  The Smoked Pork Belly Sandwich ($9.00) consisted of pork belly & shoulder, ranch sauce, cabbage slaw, and lemon zest.   Getting to the meat of the matter, the pork belly was melt in your mouth goodness. The shoulder was a great compliment of texture as was the crunchy slaw. And my Achilles heel?  Ranch sauce... You can never go wrong with ranch... A solid sandwich!   The sides were more inexpensive if you ordered all three ($5 each but 3 for $12). The whole is greater than the sum of all parts?  Tater tots - they were super delicious!  Creamy mashed potato taste with a perfectly battered and fried exterior. Don't miss the gravy on the bottom - icing on the cake.   Swiss Chard - simple, with shallots and garlic. Delicious.   Beets - with lemon, dill, blackberry empire apple vinegar - I wasn't a big fan of this one. Beets were quite hard and I wasn't really enjoying the flavour.   Bottom line: interesting offering of dishes.  Not \"dinner\" worthy in my eyes.  I would go back to lounge around, snack, and drink."}
{"text":"Awesome cocktails. We only had to wait 10 mins for a spot at the bar for 2ppl on a Friday night.  The chicken and waffles were delicious. The lobster roll (which was a daily special) was tasty but seemed tiny for the price. Overall, it's cool place for drinks."}
{"text":"What can I say about the Altar Boy Burger that hasn't been said about its namesake; its tender, delicious, and it can fit in the trunk of your car.   Cooked medium rare with a nice warm pink center, the altar boy gives you such fulfillment that it has you driving slowly past a church on Sundays ;).   The place is small, but cozy. After you have indulged in many of their tasty treats, you'll be sure to be squeezing between the tables and facing the question we are all faced with on air planes, do you show them the ass or the groin?  While there, the closeness to our neighbors was comforting. It also allowed us to learn about an affair, an awkward break up, and a new strain of antibiotic resistant chlamydia.    Would recommend: - Altar boy burger - Deep fried cauliflower  - Rosemary's baby"}
{"text":"At last! My long overdue visit to the Home of the Brave finally happened for a late night dinner with my girlfriends.  Situated upstairs at the corner of King Street West and Portland Street, it's quite accessible by public transit but it could be hard to find parking.  This restaurant first caught my eye when I spotted a photo of their Kentucky Fried Handshake Sandwich (pictured above) - really eye-catching, isn't it?  From then I had the chance to get a bite of their menu offerings at food events and vowed to visit the restaurant since.  As I've heard and read good reviews from other bloggers, I went with high expectations.  The space itself is not too big but they made good arrangements to cater to diner pairs or groups of all sizes with plenty of seatings by the window, the bar, benches and booths.  As a group of four, we were seated in one of the booths for larger groups!  All the menu items we ordered were delicious and were indeed classic American comfort food with a creative twist!  To start, we all a round of their Root Beer Float (forgot to take photos) that took us down memory lane of our childhood. I don't like to drink pop but I usually can't say no to root beer!   Our favourites of the feast were the Chicken & Waffles, The 76er Philly Cheesesteak, Tater Tots and the Buffalo Cauliflower, although, everything was really, really tasty.  We did find the music to be super loud - it was a fun and casual spot to enjoy good food with great company but for your first date you might not be able to hear one another very well!

{"text":"Restaurant: Home of the Brave Cuisine: American Location: Entertainment District Address: 589 King St W Price Range: $10~  1: Poor 2: OK 3: Good 4: Very Good 5: Excellent  Food: 5 Service: 4 Ambiance: 4 Overall: 4  Yes, new restaurants are opening up left and right every week but I feel like they all serve the same thing but different ways. Anyways, but guess what! Home of the Brave did spark enough interest in me that I decided to take out my camera *wipes off dust* and go out for dinner with a friend.  So for those of you who didn't know, Home of the Brave is opened by team behind the famous La Carnita. La Carnita is easily one of my favorite restaurants in Toronto that serves Mexican street style food so I knew I was in good hands going into Home of the Brave.   It was on a Wednesday night I decided to walk in for a dinner at 6pm and the restaurant was already full. I put my name down for a table but decided to take a seat at the bar since it became avail first.  Ordered: Zombie Slush - 3 types of rum, grapefruit, pineapple and cinnamon syrup for $7. My friend had this drink and I tried a sip and boy was it strong! They def don't skimp out on alcohol!  Ordered: Bones in a Bucket - Kansas City rubbed beef and pork ribs served with ranch dressing, celery and carrot for $19. This dish was outstanding, first of all I loved the fact that we got to try both pork and beef ribs. I personally love beef ribs and found it to be very tender and the meat was falling off the bone. Pickled celery and carrot sticks were a nice touch on the side. I would def get this again if I went back.  Ordered: Kentucky Handshake Sandwich - Fried chicken, mayo, iceberg lettuce and louisiana hot sauce for $13. This is something I had to order because of its presentation. I thought only Asians eat chicken feet? I would've laughed if I saw somebody freak out over the chicken feet that comes attached to the sandwich. The sandwich def need the hot sauce that is served on the side, chicken was super juicy but didn't think it was anything special.  Ordered: Buffalo Cauliflower - Beer battered cauliflower, louisiana hot sauce, ranch dressing, celery and carrot for $8. I wasn't sure if I will like this but it was one of the best dishes we ordered that night. I didn't know deep fried cauliflower would taste this good, it was crunchy and hearty- perfect with louisiana hot sauce.  Ordered: Tater Tots - Crispy potatoes, cheese, gravy and herbs for $7. Served in mini cast iron pan, tater tots are just like deep fried mashed potatoes. Thin crispy outside with soft creamy inside.. says it is served with gravy but that didn't stand out to me much.  Ordered: Red Velvet Funnel Cake - My friend and I were so full but we had to try their dessert. Served with bourbon vanilla icecream on top, this was probably one of the best funnel cakes I've ever had. Tangy berries and rich cream cheese sauce on top, the funnel cake was just perfect in every way possible.  Summary: Overall I really enjoyed my meal at Home of the Brave. They serve unique dishes that you don't find at many restaurants and I love that they stick to what they do best, instead of following every food trend that is happening at the moment. I love the laid back atmosphere of the restaurant and I would def go back to try their other dishes!"}
{"text":"I AM AMERICAN!   sorry, had to get that out (not oooot). The pro(soft 'o')cess of moving to Canada has been fun, eh?    OK sorry I had to get that out. I love your country and I loved celebrating my first Canada day with yall but dammit I missed my people on the 4th of July! A group of us immigrants decided to celebrate OUR independence day at the American themed (actually more of a tea party) bar! As imagined the place was pretty dead but we shared every appetizer on their menu and absolutely LOVED everything!   I cannot wait to go back for dinner!   see? we aren't all jerks...I mean, I mostly am but we aren't ALL...."}
{"text":"Cool atmosphere.  Had their special burger, forgot the name, but there was peanut butter in it.  Great touch!  My hubby the chicken and waffles, he said it was ok.  The food was ok, but not exceptional.  May visit again if I'm in the area."}
{"text":"Get the buffalo cauliflower and cornbread! Wings are also good but nothing unique. I wasn't a fan of the ribs. Dessert is good (red velvet funnel cake). The place is very loud. Overall it was good and glad I tried it. Don't know if I would go back again..."}
{"text":"Great beverage offerings! Love that you can get craft beer from the U.S. at this pub. The cocktails are darn good too! Don't even get me started on the food...YUMMY! Get the bologna sandwich. Trust me this is unlike any bologna sandwich you'll ever have. What blows my mind is this place is never packed. I don't get how people haven't discovered this place yet. Crazy!"}
{"text":"Everything about this place screams 'Murica! The redneck decor to the American flag and their greasy fried menu items brings you across the border.   There is absolutely nothing healthy you can actually order on the menu. I really wanted to try their lobster roll but those were only offered one day out of the whole week... Same thing goes for their Chicago style deep dish pizza - can't order it unless it's a certain day if the week.   I ended up ordering a bologna sandwich which was a staple in their regular menu. The level of saltiness was out the roof... I had to chug water after each bite and after my meal I was still dying of thirst. The presentation of the sandwich was nice, perfect for a nice instagram pic, but they really need to tone down on the salt.  The fried cauliflower seems to be a favorite and it makes a great appetizer with the right amount of sauce. I'm impressed how closely the batter stuck into the cauliflower without any air pockets. Now that takes skills!   The service was attentive - we were the only ones there during lunch on a Thursday. I expected this place to be packed considering how hyped up it was on BurgersTO and BlogTO...  Would I return? Probably not. However, if you're looking to grab a beer with some appetizers, this could be your spot!"}
{"text":"Finally got a chance to check this place out with a friend.  We arrived at 7pm with only a few people in the restaurant.  It is a fairly small place so perhaps because of that the tables by the kitchen were placed close together, making it difficult not to eavesdrop on the conversations going on next to you. The place seemed to fill up by around 7:30 and was buzzing over the 90's hip hop playing in the background.  The service was friendly and very prompt, we didn't wait long for our food.  The deep fried cauliflower was good, though deep fried I didn't find it overly greasy.  My friend ordered the chicken hand shake sandwich and was completely grossed out by the chicken foot it was served with but otherwise thought the sandwich was tasty, especially when dipped in the accompanying sauce.  I ordered the ribwich which was soft, a bit sweet and smoky and oh so messy!  The rib sauce covers the plate and saturates the bun inside out.  If you don't like saucy things do not order this.    Note: the sandwiches range in price.  The ones we ordered were both $13, a bit expensive considering it was for the sandwich only and there are no sides included.  That said, we were both pretty full afterwards and did not order dessert although the peanut butter and jam ice cream inside a peanut butter cookie sandwich was very tempting.  Overall it was a good experience and the food was yummy but not O-M-G good.  ** also this restaurant is not accessible to people that use a mobility device or have difficulty with steps as the restaurant is located above ground and by stairs only**"}
{"text":"Pretty good barbecue spot with all of the classics. The mains on the menu have changed since I went but I have had the brussel sprouts, cauliflower and the tater tots from the shareables menu. All three were great and they had Sweet Jesus ice cream for dessert. Great craft beer list on tap but I didn't live the cocktails."}
{"text":"I came here on a Wednesday and it was definitely kicking. It looked as if there were no seats but there were...surprisingly. My friend and I were eager to try this American inspired food. We ordered the red velvet funnel cake and the corn bread. I heard that both very good. To my disappointment, the red velvet funnel cake came first, I was expecting the corn bread, o well...eat away I thought. the ice cream was good....similar to mcdonalds vanilla soft serve....always a good thing. The actual funnel cake was very citrus tasting and in no way tasted \"red velvet\" ...tasted like it was in artificial  orange flavouring. It was unusual in my opinion...the white sauce also tasted a little bitter and could've been sweeter... i found that this did not compliment the dessert...I would not get it again. I really wouldnt recommend this for funnel cake lovers. We got our corn bread right after and for eight dollars.... it was the smallest portion ive ever seen...looked like 4 dollars to be honest. as we began eating, we thought \"wow, the texture of this corn bread is awesome...but wait...it's spicy\" my friend and I couldn't handle the spicy. we are not spicy fanatics, and we asked the server if it's suppose to be and she said no. and in the menu it did not indicate this. for those who despise spicy, you will not be pleased....lucky my friend and I are relaxed people, I would think people who dislike spicy would give the server hell for it...we couldn't eat it after the second bite, we thought we were hallucinating but it turns out it was spicy.  luckily the server was cool and took it off the bill. I feel like I still wanna give it another chance...a lot of the pics on yelp and the types of food look appealing and aren't served at many restaurants. I shall give you a second chance home of the brave. I shall."}
{"text":"I was a little surprised at the portion size. My perception of BBQ joints is meat for days and this clearly was not. But that didn't take away from the experience. We had the burger and chicken and waffles - both very good. The burger came without fries which was also a little surprising. However the heaping side order of fries is more in line with what I expected of BBQ. Also they have Left Field on tap which hasn't been easy to find in Toronto so that was a big plus. I would definitely go back, but I wouldn't hunt it down if I wasn't in the area."}
{"text":"Recently came here to try out the red velvet funnel cake, and it was definitely worth the hype. It was very delicious, and it was a huge serving; great for sharing amongst two people. The interior and ambience of the place is alright, nothing extraordinary or memorable. The service was very friendly, fast and efficient.   I wil definitely come back here to try out their food menu, which looks very appealing as well.   I don't recommend this place for anyone with kids or strollers because the stairways to the restaurant is extremely narrow, and we had a hard time taking my friends stroller up."}
{"text":"A King West Favorite, Everything here is delicious, I keep coming back.  Instagram brought me here."}
{"text":"Ribs are ON. POINT. Root beer is home made. Chicken and waffles were quite good - could have been accompanied with more sauce.  Price was a little steep for the amount of food you get. But it's freaking delicious, so it's worth the visit!"}
{"text":"Star 1: atmosphere  Star 2: food, mediocre....(Tasted Like McDonald's)   The atmosphere was good, fun, chill and right on king street.   The food was mediocre. The burger was nothing special at all. In fact it tasted a lot like a McDonald burger and way more over priced and no side order of fries! The burger alone was 13$ and fries for 6$...a combo at McDonald's is 8$ including fries! You decide which is more worth it?  I think the food is too over hyped on Instagram and definitely not worth the price. The only reason I'd go back is for a drink, food I'll save for another place!"}
{"text":"While I had been excited about coming here I was a little disappointed with the food! We came here for a late night dinner and the burgers are not as big as they are depicted in pictures, although it is a pretty decent burger. We also had the ribs, which tastes just like Swiss Chalet just twice the price. The fries are a really good portion, and you can definitely split it between two people. The cauliflower dish was delicious, if I were to go back I would definitely order this again. The cocktails were not very good, in my opinion and I would probably just stick to a beer than their cocktail menu.  Service was good! The vibe is really easy going and the music was good too! I would probably go back for drinks with friends, but not for dinner."}
{"text":"Busy restaurant located on the King West strip. They do not accept reservations so try to come a bit earlier to get a table.  We ordered almost the entire menu (tater tots, fried cauliflower, fried chicken burger, beef burgers, phllly cheese steak, funnel cake and cheesecake ice cream). The service was very good and the food came out in a timely fashion. The dishes are quite rich so for me it is more of a every so often kind of place.  One recommendation is to share the funnel cake dessert. It can feed 2-3 people depending on how full you are from your main dishes."}
{"text":"So fun for groups. Lively atmosphere. Great music. INCREDIBLE indulgent, flavorful food. Wicked cocktails. Awesome kitchen and front of house crew. Must orders: Ribs, buffalo cauliflower, red velvet funnel cake, cornbread, tatertots. Always such a blast coming here. Send your compliments to Nate, the chef. He is the man and a great guy! :)"}
{"text":"Hands down best night spot for food and friends.   Service - lovely. Nice people make the food even better and the service here from seating us and suggesting good was on point  Drinks - so good. Nuff said.   Food - listing what was delicious which was delicious and you should get it too: - cauliflower  - speciality pizza  - tator tots  - sweet Jesus ice cream  - funnel cake   Go there. Drink with friends. Hang out . Make new friends. Do it."}
{"text":"Came by this place on a weekend evening and was told it would be an one hour wait.  We were fine with that and so they took our number to call us when our table was ready.  When they called (maybe 45mins), we got a nice comfy table near the kitchen.  I got the tator tots, which were not bad.  The cornbread I sampled was surprisingly spicy and did not do it for me at all.  My main was the chicken and waffle.  The chicken was ok, decent size but the sauce was a bit too sweet for me in the combination.  The waffle half was not good at all, it was like trying to eat a brick.  Not sure if it was a bad batch or if the waffles are always like this here.  Overall the service was good and the vibe of the place is great, too bad the food level couldn't match the tone."}
{"text":"I'm not one to write reviews but I had to do it after my experience at Home of the Brave.  The open kitchen concept is cool and all but a few of the chef's were staring down my table like we were doing something wrong!  We were there just as they opened up for service so I presumed the issue was in part to that.  Chefs if you're reading, lighten up guys!"}
{"text":"I've been to hundreds of places around the world, and the entitled attitude they show here for an average bar is mind blowing. Don't get tricked by their fancy appeal, it's a place that wants to look like they are important by creating an artificial line. It's not worth it."}
{"text":"I love this place. The people. The atmosphere. The bartenders. The food. The servers. The apps. The hosts. The desserts. THE COCKTAILS.  The Birmingham.... you're welcome."}
{"text":"Came here for the Red Velvet Funnel Cake only and was impressed.  Will def need to come back for the food in the future as they look to have a few good dishes.  Servers were cool and friendly."}
{"text":"Excellent food and cocktails. I had a delicious drink with scotch and grapefruit--so good I had to order another--and we also really enjoyed all of the appetizers we tried, including the buffalo cauliflower (amazing, especially if you're a vegetarian) and he Brussels sprouts. And save room for dessert--we had an ice cream treat sprinkled with chocolate covered ruffles chips that was truly incredible!"}
{"text":"Great selection of bourbon and shots, very tasty cocktails and super friendly staff.  I tried the pickle bucket shot - what a curious experience!! This is great place to hang out, the only thing that I did not like was the music being too loud."}
{"text":"Just popped in here for a beer and a burger because my daughter raves about it, she also raves about 1 Direction so my hopes weren't that high. It was decent, the burger was alright, I've had plenty nicer, didn't come with anything which was a bit of a let down but I wasn't starving so not the end of the world. Service was good, friendly. Relaxed atmosphere."}
{"text":"Came here during peak times, throughout a busy weekend, and enjoyed the chicken and waffles. Not too sure why it was priced at $16, as it wasn't anything THAT amazing, nor was it an 8 oz. strip sirloin, but I mean it was still pretty enjoyable and I liked that it was different than most places. Having never tried chicken and waffles and it not being a common dish in Toronto, I can see people raving for a rare item, however it didn't woo me as to make me want to come back and eat it again.  The atmosphere was highly energetic and intimate, as the seats are fairly close to one another and the lights are dim. The staff are very consistent and attentive, refilling water after every dry bottle, and making sure customers are well taken care of. I will commend them for that.  I would recommend this place for their dishes, but probably wouldn't be interested to come back myself."}
{"text":"Decent Chicken and waffles. Nothing to rave about. I'd try something else if I ever went again."}
{"text":"Good take on American home cooking - with a focus on the South. Try the Kentucky Fried Handshake sandwich, the Bones in a Bucket, and beets on the side. Marvellous cocktails.   Decor is warm Industrial meets Billy Bob with amusing chalk art edgings.   However, far too loud ambiance makes conversation challenging. Stop trying so hard and you will be cool. Service was forgetful and spotty. They are heavy on wait staff, but they were all over the place."}
{"text":"Looks like I missed the good ol' days when the prices were a tad lower...  Balogna sandwich is now 11 bucks.  Inverse relationship:  price goes up, portion size goes down.  Looking at the photos, this is quite evident.  Damn good sandwich though.  Cauliflower was yummy.  $8 for approximately 15 bite-sized pieces.  The mark up is crazy but I know I can't make cauliflower taste like this.  Draft/draught root beer was good.  However, served with way too much ice.  Two thirds of the glass was ice.    Cool decor,  bumpin' music, friendly staff.    Wish they maintained the 3 for $12 side dishes too.  I didn't see that on the menu."}
{"text":"Its always nice to go to a new place, stand awkwardly at the serving station for 5 minutes and then leave. I understand you guys were busy but a \"sorry, we will be right with you\" is just basic customer service."}
{"text":"Came here yesterday to catch up with a friend. It's located on the second floor in a small area with a tables overlooking the street and a bar, and tables and booths located in the back with an open kitchen. It is American themed with hip hop playing. Very laid back vibe. We opted to sit near the kitchen but the tables were a bit too close together.   I got the Wednesday special which was the Chicago deep dish pizza. It came out fast and was very hot. It was nice and doughy with lots of tomato sauce but could have used more cheese. We ordered a side of taters that came with gravy but it was a bit salty for my liking. My friend got got the philly Cheesesteak and he enjoyed it. We ordered the red velvet funnel cake and it was amazing. The fruits and Bourbon vanilla ice cream went so well with it. It wasn't overly sweet. I wish it was bigger. A person could probably eat this on their own if they have a big sweet tooth.  The bill wasn't too pricy; about 50 bucks for both of us. Not sure if I'll be rushing back but if I do I'll try the chicken and waffles. Very great service."}
{"text":"Came here for a birthday lunch on Saturday. Our server was amazing and had lots of recommendations for us. We had the beer battered cauliflower to start... SO GOOD. Had the philly cheesesteak and the bologna sandwich, both delicious. Only downfall was no caesars! I know your concept is \"all American\" but come on... You're in Canada! Get a caesar on your menu!"}
{"text":"I went here with a few friends for dinner last night.  Not. Impressed.  I always dreamt that the first time I reviewed on Yelp I would be moved by a dining experience so beautiful, so exhilarating, so...life affirming that I would be moved to run home to my computer and shout out to the world, \"THIS MEAL WAS DELICIOUS!\".   Sadly, this was not the case at Home of the Brave.  The decor, lovely. The staff, charming. The company, fantastic. The food, pretty damn good but with a caveat, the portions were so petite and so highly priced, given the size, that I simply cannot imagine going back. When paying $9.00 (All prices in CAD) for a philly cheese steak I would hope that it would come with some sort of side and be longer than two inches in length. However, this was not case. The portion sizes were very similar with the other food we ordered.  By the way, try the brussels sprouts...they're divine and at $5 were not horribly over priced."}
{"text":"I've been here 3x: dinner, late night eats, just drinks.  The vibe is great, with hip hop in the background (can get loud) and strong cocktails. The slushes are a must-try.   Things I've eaten (not sure if they're all still on the menu): chicken sandwich (amazing), fried cauliflower (meh), fried Bologna sandwich (surprisingly good and I don't like bolonga), red velvet funnel cake (dream come true) and ice cream sandwich (a bit sweet for me).  Service cab be a bit scattered but always friendly and with a smile. If you're looking for a place to grab a causal, late dinner this is the spot. Be sure to stay for drinks after. :)"}
{"text":"So the backstory: Went to Home of the Brave in favour of trying something new instead of going to trusty ol' Lou Dawg's right underneath it, or eternally beautiful Wvrst a few steps over. I was accompanied by two strapping young gentlemen. We viewed the menu and expected for the prices that the servings would be adequate and filling.   Nope. So we were seated at the bar while waiting for a table, and the staff was generally friendly and attentive. The decor and layout is like many a hipster restaurant in the Toronto area. Nothing particularly riveting. When we were seated after about a ten minute wait, we were crammed into a small table - tables of the same size were being used to seat couples, but ours had an extra chair. Our side plates didn't even fit on the table which made the sharing aspect of our experience redundant.   One of my dining partners and I both ordered the beef dip, which was the special on Wednesday. Had they created one sandwich, cut it in half and served it on two plates hoping we wouldn't notice? Was it really that small for $9? It was a great sandwich, but tiny. TINY. The beets were fine - a little under-seasoned and lacklustre. The brussels sprouts were great. My other friend ordered ribs which came to $19 and were not what one would expect to receive portion-wise for the price.   By partner in beef-dip ordered a chocolate chip cookie ice cream sandwich that he declared was the best part of the meal, because he was still hungry. He also contemplated heading to Wvrst for a sausage. I made a can of soup when I got home."}
{"text":"$85 after tax and tip for two appetizers, two mains, two desserts, and a beer. We were stuffed.    APPETIZER: Brussels Sprouts ($7) --------------------------------------------------­­--------------------- Smoked Cheese Sauce, Parmesan, toasted mustard seed. Pretty tasty. A little cheesy, a little salty.   APPETIZER: Buffalo Cauliflower ($8) --------------------------------------------------­­--------------------- Beer battered cauliflower, buffalo hot sauce, ranch dressing. SO GOOD. Standout out of all the dishes. Unfortunately, looking at other Yelpers' pictures, it seems like either it's not regulated or they've shrunk the portion, but we got maybe 10 pieces. It didn't really fill the plate, but other Yelpers' pictures look like they're about to overflow. Delicious nonetheless.  MAIN: Chicken & Waffles ($16) --------------------------------------------------­­--------------------- Crispy chicken, sour cream, spicy maple, green onion, sourdough waffles. A waffle sliced diagonally sandwiching three pieces of boneless fried chicken. The syrup was great. Not too spicy or overpowering. The sour cream was an interesting addition. Can't say it added much, but I like sour cream. The chicken was crispy and could've been a tad juicier, but it was delicious nonetheless.  MAIN: Home of the Brave Burger ($13) --------------------------------------------------­­--------------------- House ground ribeye, HOTB pickle mayo, House American cheese, Tomato, Lettuce. I don't like pickles or pickled things, but I didn't taste anything overpowering. The burger was just delicious. I don't like when burgers don't come with any sides. I don't consider it a complete main course and a bit of a money-grab, but the burger was good though.   There are actually more desserts than are shown on their website's menu. We had these two:  DESSERT: Fluffer Nutter ($6) --------------------------------------------------­­--------------------- Twist, peanut butter sauce, marshmallow coated ruffles, peanuts, white & milk chocolate. Lots of peanuts. That's the predominant flavour with this ice cream cone. The first few bites were like peanuts, peanuts, chocolate, and more peanuts. They give you a dish so that you can lay it sideways and eat it with spoons because I bet it'd get messy otherwise. The ruffles aren't that prominent, but the chunks that you do find are delicious.   DESSERT: Red Velvet Funnel Cake ($8) --------------------------------------------------­­--------------------- Red velvet batter, fresh berries, cream cheese icing, sweet Jesus vanilla soft serve. Way too sweet and I usually like sweet stuff like white chocolate. Maybe they've improved the batter because despite other reviews, the funnel cake was not hard at all. It wasn't fully crispy either. I guess it was a comfortable middle. The cream cheese icing is overkill. With the ice cream, the dish is already sweet. The icing makes the dish unbearably sweet. Everything else was pretty good.   I was satisfied with every dish with the exception of the icing on the funnel cake. The portions weren't huge (despite our server's warning), but I think you could comfortably share an appetizer with someone, have your own main, possibly skip the dessert, and be satisfied. We ordered everything just cause we wanted to try it all.   Aside from the obvious choice of fried chicken and waffles, the buffalo cauliflower was a clear standout. Would definitely recommend that one."}
{"text":"Knowledgeable bar staff is the key to any high review expectations. They meet all these qualifications.  Friendly knowledgeable, ideal atmosphere, without blaring music, and happy to help assist where needed. Great recommendations, and did a fine job with my old-fashioned."}
{"text":"Pricey,  food was Meh,  I had the broccoli and grits and my buddy had th  peanut wings...  Nothing special at all...  3 star only because of beer and good old school hip hop music"}
{"text":"Everything was delicious!  Had the chicken sandwich, best chicken sandwich I've ever had but it's really greasy.  The crab cake was very good, the inside is very flaky.  And of course the icecream sandwich was delicious, loved the mint one!  The service was excellent!  The menu was small though and most of it is very greasy."}
{"text":"Small upstairs bar with below average American style food. Not accommodating so don't ask for a substitution or a hold. Less than two hours at the table was asked to move to the bar. Amateur approach masquerading as 'this is how we do things'."}
{"text":"Cool dishes. Had their wing special and chicken and waffles and red velvet funnel cake here. Good service pretty upping spot. A bit unexpected since its hidden. Not a lot of tables though so it's a bit cluttered in here."}
{"text":"I have never been so disgruntled with a place as I have been here. We arrive at 11pm and were literally refused seating just because we're not eating dinner. We offered to order one or two food items but the hostess insisted that dinner must be ordered or we had to all stand around the bar which was full... And leave two large tables that could have fit all of us empty.   Awful service. Doesn't matter if you have good drinks or dessert, the service is downright awful and I will not be back."}
{"text":"I came here with a large group and had a great time. The vibe in this place is laidback and very casual. I was definitely digging the old schools tunes that blasted from the speakers.  There were so many things we wanted to try from the menu, as all the deep fried goodness sounded appetizing! I shared two sandwiches  and I thoroughly enjoyed the fried bologna sandwich, more so than the Kentucky fried handshake sandwich. The latter came with delicious spicy hot sauce. I absolutely loved the tater tots that were bursting with flavour! I was told that the nachos were super spicy. I had the chocolate chip cookie dough ice-cream sandwich for dessert, and sadly, it wasn't as delicious as it sounds. I enjoy chewy, warm chocolaty cookies and the ones that were served were incredibly hard. The cookie dough ice-cream was also very hard and not very tasty.   Service was good. HOTB is definitely worth another visit."}
{"text":"King West has a lot of popular bars and restaurants with quirks that help them stand out from the crowd. This seems like one of the places which has an interesting and well executed menu, but is just not worth any hype.  It's got an all-American thing going and I believe each dish on the menu is from a different local (don't quote me here!!). I had the Maryland crab cakes (which is a salad that comes with 3 cake cakes). The crab cakes were good. However, nothing too spectacular. The lettuce was bitter. I despise salads and the only reason I ordered this was for the crab (and I wasn't feeling like anything too heavy).  My friends got the chicken and waffles. I tasted it and have to say while it was nice it was a bit on the sweet side. One of my friends had ordered it just a couple days prior and felt that it was a bit dry that time and a bit sweet this time. I mixed in some \"hot sauce\" (a house sauce that was deemed to be hot by the server? It wasn't hot btw) and it did wonders to balance out the over-sweetness.  We also shared the EPI-Pen ice cream. It was a chocolate and pea u butter ice cream with crushed peanuts on top. Sort of like a drumstick. It was a seriously large portion of ice cream and too much peanut butter for my liking.  Thus far the food while mediocre and pricey does not warrant the 3 stars. For all of that and the good service I would likely have given this place 4 stars. They have drink specials and are friendly and quirky; all things I like. However, they have a 20% preset tip on their debit/credit machines. If you don't know by now, this is my personal pet peeve with restaurants. Preset/suggested tips makes me tip less than the original 20% I was going to leave!! It's seriously rude to expect your customers to tip at 20% and it leaves them feeling ashamed when they cannot AFFORD that much. I understand that the clientele in the King West area is on the somewhat wealthier side. Or at least they like to think they are. But you will have customers who are from other locales coming by and it's not cool to make them feel pressured to tip higher than what is customary!!  All in all, mediocre place with quirks that might appeal to those who love the States."}
{"text":"Love it here! The food is amazing, the service is great and the graphic design is lovely. I can't wait to take out of town guests here. Love when places like this come to Toronto."}
{"text":"Friday night dinner - what an adventure. This place is incredibly loud and packed but everyone seemed to be having an amazing time.  We ordered the tater tots as an app - sooo tasty.   For entrees we had the Kentucky handshake sandwich that weirded me out a bit with the foot hanging out of the end but it was really yummy and the chicken and waffles - nice flavor however, order the syrup on the side - it can be a bit overwhelming.   In addition they have these really fun boozy slushies that were really good. We had the Arnold Palmer and Sex on the Beach. If you had 2 or more of these, prepared to be wheeled home somehow. Wow!"}
{"text":"Being a person who doesn't eat red meat or poultry I was expecting a salad-which isn't my most exciting option. I asked the waiter however and all the chicken wing options can be made with cauliflower! I had the buffalo cauliflower (app) and the sweet and sour cauliflower main. The buffalo cauliflower is amazing, the sweet and sir wasn't my favorite but I'm still happy I tried it. Overall, he vegetarian options, while they look limited, are great (especially if you like cauliflower). They also have a nice cocktail menu, and the vibes are fun and relaxed."}
{"text":"Cons: The portion of food is too little for the price they charge, and I was shocked that they had something like \"The Home Of the Brave Burger\" in their menu. This burger will looks and taste like a $2 burger, complete rip-off.  Pros: Other things in the menu tasted decent. The interior setup has a nice ambiance. Service is nice and helpful. The alcohol slush tasted great. They serve small selection of \"Sweet Jesus\" desert which is good.  Will I go back there again? NO, there are other better places."}
{"text":"You don't know soft serve ice cream in Toronto until you've had their Sweet Jesus; just the right amount of creamy, with a citrus undertone that'll have you licking your lips!  $4 a pop for Chocolate, Vanilla, or a twist."}
{"text":"Was looking for some greasy food on a Saturday night, and what better place to go than an appropriately named restaurant symbolizing America.  I had the Saturday Burger special, Buffalo Cauliflower and split a red velvet Funnel cake for dessert. The Burger was just Okay, but everything else was good. My friends had the chicken and waffles which I tried, and it was also very good.   Thought you music was good (hip hop), service was alright and the place seemed like a decent place to grab some drinks. I can definitely see myself going back for a drink or when I feel like some greasy eats again."}
{"text":"An interesting twist on American Classic cuisine. The Ribs are amazing - simply delicious and so tender. The Buffalo Cauliflower is good too! However, I wasn't a fan of their mixed cocktails or the Philly Cheesesteak. But I would come back an try other items on the menu."}
{"text":"What is American food exactly? After my visit to home of the brave I am still not sure, but a couple of things I am certain of is that most of it is deep fried and that it is most definitely not a healthy option.   I came here with a friend on a Saturday night because I had been hearing some good things about this place. We decided to share the following:   Fried cauliflower- Nicely battered and fried, the batter was a bit thicker than I anticipated but not greasy at all. It was served with a side of ranch and hot sauce which complimented the cauliflower well. I was a fan of this dish.   Tater tots: served in a small cast iron skillet this was a side dish, but turned out to be my favourite dish of the night. The tater tots were so buttery; they practically melted in your mouth. This dish is a must order.   Kentucky fried handshake sandwich: This is basically their rendition of the KFC Big Crunch sandwich, only they keep the chicken foot attached to the filet. The filet was juicy, nicely breaded with great crunch. This was a good version of a fast food chicken sandwich.   Johnny cake w/ smoked trout: This was my least favourite dish of the meal. It consisted of a cornmeal griddle cake, topped with a savoury whipped cream, chives, smoked trout, and maple syrup. I enjoyed my first few bites and found the contrast of smoky and sweet flavours intriguing. However as I ate more of this I found it to be too sweet (i.e. drenched in maple syrup) which was a bit off-putting since the trout also had an intense smokiness. The only redeeming quality was that the griddle cake (somewhere between pancake and crepe) had a great texture.   Ice cream cookies: This was an ice cream sandwich. This was a very rich and heavy dessert. The cookie, which was made in house, was not as soft as I hoped it would be. The choice to make this with cookie dough ice cream made the dessert way too heavy, I think a plain vanilla ice cream would make it much better.   The restaurant itself has a nice, industrial vibe. The service was attentive and the food came out of the kitchen very quickly. One complaint is that the chair I sat in was easily the most uncomfortable thing ever. They do have a small beer selection with a few craft beers on tap or in bottles; they also carry PBR if you really want the entire American experience.   Although a lot of the food we ate was well prepared, I did not find any of the flavours to be special or bold. Overall this would be a great place to grab a beer and maybe a snack if one is feeling like something deep fried. I won't be rushing back, but I will likely return."}
{"text":"Came here a couple days ago with a friend after a coworker recommended this place. I had a great experience! Located in King West around a number of poppin restaurants,  its on the second level, a little tiny, but great for dinner with a small group of friends (emphasis on the small). Cocktails are pretty pricey at $12 per; although I would've loved to try one, I didnt feel like spending that much.  To start, my friend and I ordered a shareable plate of tater tots which were served in a cute little pan topped with green onions and some type of reduction - it was a tasty way to start the night. For my main, I went with the chicken and waffles.. It wad the first time I've ever tried this dish from anywhere and well, I don't think it'll be the last! Pretty sure it was dark meat which made it very juicy. It was battered and topped with maple syrup (of course) and a mayo based sauce - cost $16. The dessert menu consisted of a variety of Ice cream options from sweet Jesus, leading me to believe that these restaurants are affiliated  It's a lively place perfect for hanging out with friends, would come back again :)"}
{"text":"Eating here gave me the heebie jeebies (translation, it gave me goosebumps). For those who grew up in the 90's and familiar with R.L. Stine, my meal here resembled the claw often featured on Goosebumps novel covers. Yikes, it still gives me the shivers!   We came here on a weeknight, and the place was relatively busy. As an aside, I should note with embarrassment that the entrance to this place can often be confused (we're told) with the bar located right beside it (whose name escapes me) - we actually went in and sat down, thinking it was Home of the Brave (it wasn't). So, keep a look out for the signs indicating which door is to which restaurant!  We ordered: a) the 76er Philly Cheesesteak, b) the Kentucky Fried Handshake Sandwich, and c) the wings feature for that evening. The wings were fine, not as flavourful as we would hope, and it doesn't seem like the flavours and sauces really sunk into the meat. Likewise with the Philly Cheesesteak - I could tell that a lot of effort was put into presentation, but the actual flavours in the dish left much to be desired. It was a bit bland and didn't feel balanced - too much salt, lacked quality, not enough tastiness in the meat or the overall meal.   Lastly... what can I say about The Claw? It was pointy, but actually very delicious. The Kentucky Handshake Sandwich wins for novelty, but it definitely creeped me out (I almost couldn't touch it). After I got over it, I have to say that the sandwich was the best dish of the three we ordered. The chicken patty was crunchy, well cooked, and well seasoned, while the bun was also super soft and chewy (it tasted like an insurmountably better quality McChicken burger). It isn't everyday you fear being attacked by your sandwich, but I ended up attacking it myself, heartily enjoying it more than I initially thought I would.   For two people, with tax and tip, we paid around $42 dollars. For us, overall, the food quality was nothing more than a solid 3. Keep in mind that street parking is limited, though if you park on the side street one block south of the restaurant, parking is free after 9:00 PM."}
{"text":"Great cocktails. Friendly staff. Deliciously gourmet low brow food? I honestly have no idea how to describe this place. The La Carnita folks have done it again. A welcome and necessary addition to this neighbourhood. Enjoy."}
{"text":"I've been to Home of the Brave a couple of times now and each time the food is okay. The vibe and atmosphere is very chill so it makes up for the food. The staff is also really great and the food comes out fast. I do have to say the buffalo cauliflower is the best!"}
{"text":"We came here on a Friday night. It was pretty booked and we had to wait about 30 minutes for a seat to free up. Reserve in advance if you can.    In terms of the decor, it spelt \" 'Murcia\". It was definitely went well with the theme. I ordered chicken and waffles and cornbread. The chicken and waffles was the best I've had. I thought it was better than Harlem's Amy Ruth's, Markham's Inspire and Atlanta's Gladys Knight. Keep in mind, the portion is a bit on the smaller side and I'd recommend ordering other things on the menu. The cornbread was equally amazing. You can't really tell it's cornbread at first glance because of all the other things on it, but whatever it was made it so much better.   My friend ordered the fried chicken sandwich and said it was pretty good. In terms of drinks, I ordered Children of the Corn which was on the stronger side. It was a bit too sour for my liking, but that's just a personally preference. My friends enjoyed the alcoholic slush. Overall, the ambiance and the food were great and I would return"}
{"text":"Made my Tuesday! Felt a little bit like home (LA)... Came alone but great friendly crowd... not hard to make friends. Friendly staff. Great music. Two thumbs up!"}
{"text":"4 stars cause of service only. This place is a little hip eatery with amazing food. I had the chicken and waffles and red velvet funnel cake dessert !!! Both were out of this world. The chicken is moist and boneless and drizzled in syrup and another sauce that was sweet and tangy. I should have ordered 2 actually.Great little hipster place in toronto !!"}
{"text":"Small place, decent / good food, a little bit pricey but not unreasonable. Chicken and waffles was good."}
{"text":"The menu is quite small, not a lot to choose from. But the food is delicious. It's American style dishes. I had the Buffalo cauliflower- it's drizzled in ranch sauce (get this!!!! - soooo good). We also tried the chicken and waffles and the chicken wings."}
{"text":"Unique idea for foods and all tasted great. Loved it here. Atmosphere suites this place well, unique and welcoming. The service was superb friendly as well. Fav dishes was the chicken hand burger and red velvet funnel cake. Would def come here again."}
{"text":"As a big fan of La Carnita was excited to check it out. Don't get me wrong - it was tasty and all pretty much deep fried... And really anything deep fried is good but doesn't mean it's great.   Between the four of us had most of the menu. A few highlights but most was a solid 3/5.   - Cauliflower: best dish of the night by far - we ordered a second one  - Fries: as you would expect, solid fries  - Bucket of bones: some very good size ribs, tasty sauce  - Tater tots: meh - Caesar wedge: meh - Bologna Sandwich: interesting, definitely not the bologna I remember  - Fried chicken handshake sandwich: good but your typical fried chicken: not the best not the worst   Cocktail list was ok but not as interesting as I would have hoped. Beer list was pretty good considering the American theme. But would be great to see them bring in some more American craft brews, in fact La Carnita has a great interesting beer list... almost should be reversed.   Vibe was good - very very loud (even for us) but booth seating is great for a large group.   Check it out - but if you'll pick a place to go back between this and La Carnita - it will be the latter."}
{"text":"Awesome, the only complaint I have is the volume. Like others stated, it can be a bit loud. It was after the blue Jays game and their was awesome old school rap playing so I'm cool with it.    The food? AWESOME..... we had the cauliflower and Brussels sprouts for apps...... Wow awesome both were flavorful... for main I had the incredible chicken and waffles, ( which btw I had a perma grin whilst eating.Wife had a philly cheese steak  which had a great flavour ( wife hates soggy bread which was a killer for her) and Mom in law had the Burger which she thoroughly enjoyed...   Desert I ordered the baseball helmet sundae, and was very, deeply enjoying and I don't even order desserts. WOW!!!! Pretzels, rasp and strawberries, caramel at the bottom with slices of bananas that was to die for....   I also ordered probably the best old fashioned I have ever had!!!    I can't wait to go back and enjoy the afternoon with good music, tasty food, and great people..."}
{"text":"Stopped by here on a Tuesday and it was packed to my surprise. Waited about 15 minutes for a table of 2. The hostess was super nice and considerate which is rare for busy popular restaurants.  I was a little skeptical cause I haven't liked many 'hot' new restaurants but HOTB was pretty awesome. The music was 2001-2005 inspired which brought back a lot of old school memories.   Drinks are pricey but STRONG, when I say strong, it's the type of strong drink you'd have at a house party and you make it yourself. The Rum slushie is amazing.  I had the Pork Belly sandwich which was huge and the red velvet funnel cake was delicious as well and surprisingly not too sweet.  Only drawback is no reservations which means you're waiting in line for sure unless you get there before 630pm."}
{"text":"TLDR; Americana at its finest. Too greasy and salty for my personal preference. Loud, loud music. But I enjoyed the vibe, I would maybe return.  VIBE Helpful, friendly waitress. Music was REALLY really loud, to the point we had to scream at each other to be heard across the table. Restaurant is dim and has a fun Americana vibe. I like the open kitchen.  FOOD We had the tater tots to start, they were fried balls and were actually quite nice. I might order them again.  We had the shaved meat and pistachio sandwich, burger, and American fries as our main. Shaved meat was super tasty, just a bit too greasy. The burger was phenomenal. I could have done without the fries."}
{"text":"I'm pretty indifferent with this place. The general vibe I got was not bad but over priced and lacking the service to justify it. A chicken sandwich is $13, and a open-faced Philly Cheese is $15, and these do not come with any sides. So even adding an order of french fries on at $7, and you're looking at a $20-$22 + tax and tip price tag for a complete plate of food. Alternatively to spending $14 on an order of brussel sprouts and french fries as our sides, we opted for a plate of Chicken & Waffles ($16) which was a way better decision and probably the favourite thing we ate.  While not really a good deal by any means, I will admit, the food was good tasting. A big part of that is actually because of the sauce that came along with the chicken sandwich. It's this \"buffalo hot sauce\" that actually has a nice creaminess to it. We were dipping the chicken sandwich, dripping it on the chicken & waffles, and also pouring onto the philly cheesesteak. Without this magical sauce, everything would've been just okay.   2 drinks, 2 sandwiches and an order of chicken & waffles came to $63 + tip. It wasn't underwhelming, but nothing wow'ed and the service was pretty spotty as well, so I can't really give it more than a 3 star seal of approval."}
{"text":"Fantastic chicken and waffles! Delicious Rogue Dead Guy Ale on tap. Great atmosphere. Fantastic service."}
{"text":"I just come here for the red velvet funnel cake.  So yummy!  Place looks a little dingy but I think it is just part of the atmosphere.  It wasn't dirty or anything.  Staff is always friendly."}
{"text":"Great place for winding down after work and catching up with friends! I recommend getting their old fashion and the buffalo cauliflower. The buffalo cauliflower was an unexpected pleasant surprise - there were deep fried bits, was just the right amount of spicy and went well with the old fashion."}
{"text":"Came here on a Friday evening at 6pm and it filled up really fast. Atmosphere is very loud so don't expect to come here and have deep conversations - unless you want to be shouting from across the table.   We got the tator tots - yum! chicken & waffles (chicken was good, waffles were way too sweet), chicken leg sandwich - it was okay but definitely more of a novelty item, and the lobster roll - mediocre at best. I was told that people go there on Fridays just for the lobster roll, which sold me however when it came out I was sadly disappointed as the whole lobster roll was cold, including the bread. The cold roll would have been okay had the taste been good but it wasn't. So the lobster roll here gets failing marks from me.  Not to mention the price was something ridiculous like $22 and it doesn't even come with a side.   I'm glad I got to experience it to see what all the hype was about but unfortunately it's all hype. If I were ever to return it will probably be just to have some drinks instead of eating."}
{"text":"My companion thought this play on 'merican foods was funny. I would have rather gone to another fine establishment Toronto had to offer. I had the cheese steak, and it was pretty good. Seats overlooking the street were fun, as were the Euro size PBRs. Nothing special unless American food is a treat for you."}
{"text":"Classic American to the next level, cool and hip restaurant. But it surely is not the best. They use a lot of oil and MSG which makes my stomach upset. Mind you, I'm okay with moderate exposure to oil and MSG but it seems that they use a lot of it here. The Chicken waffle is supposedly their famous item but it was just okay for me."}
{"text":"Specialty: Creative interpretations of American-inspired dishes Dining Experience: Dinner Location:  589 King Street West, Toronto, Ontario Menu items: Corn Bread, Kentucky Fried Handshake Sandwich, Chicken and Waffles, Maryland Crab Cakes  Home of the Brave is home to some brave food. Food one most welcome with open arms, a firm handshake and an empty stomach.  Known for it's creative spin on traditional American dishes, a clubby yet nonchalant ambiance and a small space, HOTB serves up quite a meal and some dangerous cocktails (must try The Derby) that are sure to compete with fellow Toronto King West restaurants.  But former La Carnita kitchen pals, Andrew Richmond and Jonathan Hamilton, are not in for a competition; rather they bring a breath of fresh air to the King strip of trendy restaurants, breaking away from traditional upscale meals, and bringing it back to basics for us lovers of all things fried, greasy and homey.  Like the Cornbread, a crowd pleaser for its spongy and moist texture. Corn kernels are still present through each bite while the juiciness from the house double-smoked bacon and roasted garlic and shallots infuse the bread with flavour. Add a bit of green onion for good luck (and texture) and you've got yourself a dish that in itself passes for a meal. \"Sharsies\"on this one, a must.  Crab cakes are tough to \"nail\" for any restaurant. Those little circles of joy look as though they are the easiest appetizer to make, but a bit much or less of something and the cake is a thing of the past. Yet this is not the case at Home of the Brave. The dynamic kitchen duo make it a point to have these bite-sized pockets of flavour made to perfection with a light breading that is crispy, enveloping some herb-infused fresh crab and accompanied by a slaw drizzled with home-made shallot dressing which balances out the dish quite fantastically.  For those of you that enjoy indulgence, the Chicken and Waffles are not to be missed at HOTB. A skewer breaks through some thick-crispy chicken thigh pieces and sweet and savory waffles that are topped with sour cream, spicy maple sauce and green onion. No further introduction required.  And remember when I said one must welcome Home of the Brave's food with a firm handshake? Well, I was being quite literal. Leg with foot included (bonus), the Kentucky Fried Handshake Sandwich brings some unexpected rejoice to tables as groups shake the so called foot before indulging on this succulent and juicy piece of meat that is deep-fried to perfection and topped with spicy buffalo hot sauce, mayo and iceberg lettuce.  So if you are brave enough, and can not wait to shake the hand (or foot) that feeds you, head to Home of the Brave. Who knows, you might find me with cocktail in one hand and leg/foot on the other!  Buen Provecho, Viviana."}
{"text":"All about the greasy, fatty, high calorie food that taste absolutely amazing!!!  Don't look for craft beer or anything Canadian, these guys are called Home of the Brave for a reason.  Love the open kitchen in the back and the chill vibe in the front.  Call the Chef in the back \"Captain America\" see what he says...."}
{"text":"I went to this restaurant for a friends birthday with 4 other guests. We went around 730 pm on a Friday and were given a very spacious booth. We started with the tater tots (which were my favourite dish of the night!) and the corn bread (although a small serving,very very good). We also tried the Chicken and Waffles, Cheese Steak,and Ribs! Everything was really tasty. I only wish I had another stomach because the dessert menu looked great but I didn't want to be paralyzed from over eating..so I had to stop (reluctantly). Their drink menu looked great although more than I'd like to pay (15 for a cocktail,what you would expect in king west).   I cant wait to return!!"}
{"text":"Overall: 3.5/5  It was very lively in here on a Tuesday night, good energy. Good service.  Broccoli and Grits: Had so much potential but didn't have a lot of flavour. Very one note. Felt like I was eating fat and oil garnished with some broccoli. I liked the texture though haha.  Lobster Roll: It was good, but nothing special and the portion for the price was off, I guess it is King West...  Johnny Cakes w Smoked Trout: I was really looking forward to this. I really liked it until it got way too cloying. The johnny cake is literally soaked in syrup. Felt sick after.  Will I be back? Had a good vibe and interesting menu. Might come to have drinks and try some other stuff."}
{"text":"Decided to check these guys out 'cause I heard they were the same people as La Carnita(amazing btw).  Went on a Friday night. Got a table right away.  Service was great. Waitress was friendly and my water was never below the half way mark.  I got the Philly Cheesesteak. My friend got the freedom fries and the chicken and waffles.  The cheesesteak was pretty great, but it was the tiniest sandwich. Was still hungry so tried some of the fries. They seemed over cooked and salted. My friend said the chicken and waffles tasted really good.   Ended up walking across to Big Smoke Burger afterwards for a cheeseburger that really hit the spot.  I might be back again if I'm in the area."}
{"text":"I've been meaning to come to this place for a while since its been on my instagram for a long time! If you're looking for an awesome place to meet up with friends for some drinks and watching the game this is your spot. The front has a great open window that over looks King st and at night it turns into a real hidden gem in Toronto. They have a great selection on tap and great cocktails.  I ordered the Beer battered cauliflower and it was delicious! a vegetarian version of a buffalo chicken wing, the outside was crispy and the cauliflower became soft and melt in your mouth flavor (highly recommended.)   As my main I got the 76er Philly Cheesesteak, for the price I paid the portion seemed small. The quantity of meat looked like it was a lot but at I wasn't able to taste the meat flavor. The initial bite was great but eventually the grease from the cheese started to overpower all the components on the dish. I finished the sandwich quickly and was left wanting more. The meal came with no sides (no salad or fries) which I was disappointed in.   Overall, if you're looking for a good place to hang out and grab some drinks this is a great spot. But in regards to the food, if you're waiting for more than 15 mins for a table, I'd go somewhere else. For the price point and what you get, there are better options on King St."}
{"text":"Come here pretty frequently. Has quickly become the go-to for dinner for one of my friends and I. The alcoholic slushies are always killer, the other night they had a passion fruit and rum one, my friend and I both had 2. They were amazing. Also the philly cheesesteak sandwich is a MUST, easily my favourite thing on the menu. Staff are also always super friendly and you can tell they have fun working. I'm sure I'll be by again soon :)"}
{"text":"Walked in last night and found a spot at the bar. The bartender was very attentive, friendly, and gracious. He even put on a bit of a show. Enjoyed the cocktail selection, albeit I found them a tad too sweet (I tried 'that seal song' and 'wake the dead') otherwise great glassware and garnishes. For friendly service and some nice cocktails, I would recommend!"}
{"text":"Great atmosphere and even greater food. The Lobster rolls and crab cakes were amazing."}
{"text":"Came here on a Monday night, pretty empty. I was looking first to having the chicken and waffles but were told that they took it off the menu.  We shared the chili cheese nachos and the buffalo cauliflower. The nachos were actually very good- fresh and crispy unlike the stale ones you would normally get at a bar.  The fried cauliflower was crispy and flavourful- I was skeptical at first but it was a pleasant surprise.  I had the hot chicken sandwich ($12) - light batter and moist and crispy. My friends had the ribs and they fell off the bone, but they seemed a bit pricy ($19) for how much you get.  The not so great foods were the mac n cheese and the fries, which everyone agreed had way too much salt.  Our server was really great and always checked on us, and also extended our happy hour beer price for a bit too."}
{"text":"Great place!   Came here for a friend's birthday bit left early. So came here again because I heard it turns into a dance floor after 11pm. Which it does and it's awesome!   Music: HipHop/90s -  okay maybe that's because I'm a millennial, I can't help it! These are my jams!   Coat check is available ($5) and drinks are relatively cheap.   Would definitely come around again when in the area!"}
{"text":"A fun place to eat at.  The sides for $12 was a great deal. Found the swiss chard and the beets a touch too sweet. After a couple of bites it became overwhelming.   Buffalo cauliflower was great.  Lobste-rolls were good too. Personally I would have enjoyed them if the lobster was chopped up a bit more and had a little more aioli.   Wasn't a fan of the wine-list as it was  very non-descript. Simply named the type of wine and where it was from. So it would be best to stick to the beers or cocktails.  Would have enjoyed this place allot more if the music wasn't so loud.  I do hope this restaurant will change its menu every so often as their fun snacks will seem to get tiresome."}
{"text":"I've been to HOTB a few times and I haven't been disappointed yet! The Chicago style deep dish pizza is great!! Their chefs got it perfect.  I also reccomnd the chicken & waffles and don't ever leave without atleast trying one of their amazing deserts!"}
{"text":"Amazing service through and through! I apologize for not remembering the server's name who we spent hours with that evening - but he was extremely funny, personable, and honest.  Food was great - alcohol was strong (not a complaint) - and the atmosphere was EVEN better. We ordered slaw, fries, cobb, chicken and tots.   For drinks - freezies, shots, strong islands (note STRONG) and well, from that point on, the rest of the night was a blur.  Thanks for an amazing time!!!"}
{"text":"Home of the Brave!   Oh what the hell. Was disputing between 4 and 5 star but I really enjoyed it here! Minus half a star for the music being a little bit TOO blaringly loud, as others mentioned it was a bit hard to make conversation.  What impressed me the most was the cost of the food was quite reasonable, and everything was delicious! My buddy and I split a pork belly sandwich ($9), a crab cake salad ($12) and a plate of beets ($5) which was a perfect amount of food for two people and quite cheap really.  The crab cake salad was delicious - salad consisting of yellow and green beans tossed in a pad thai type sauce, topped with peanuts, a soft boiled egg and 1 crab cake. Really tasty and could be a small meal on it's own.  The pork belly sandwich was served on a small toasted bun, lots of meat and piled high with a purple slaw. Again, pretty tasty.  The beets were beets - what can I say - flavoured with a bit of lemon juice and dill, again really refreshing and tasty.  I saw people eating both the ribs and the chicken sandwich and both looked amazeballs!   Very interesting cocktail menu but we didn't indulge.   It was packed so we opted for a seat at the bar, which was actually fine, service was probably more prompt as we had a few bartenders on hand to pour water, take our order. Food came out quickly.  I can see the food prices here eventually soaring a bit somewhat, but hopefully I'm wrong!"}
{"text":"Delicious. I've tried multiple things on their menu, but the buffalo cauliflower and the philly cheesesteak are my favorites so far.  My brother tried the chicken handshake sandwich and was not too impressed, hence the four stars.  Cornbread was also just \"meh\" but I'm pretty particular about my cornbread (I like it sweet and moist almost like a cake) so I won't hold that against them.   It's a bit difficult to get a table (especially for four people), so pop by ahead and drop off your name and phone number."}
{"text":"I absolutely love this place!   Firstly, I loved the decor and feel of the restaurant. I would describe it as a rustic urban chic place. We sat at the bar at first to wait for a table. However, we decided to stay at the bar, despite being offered a table within 10 minutes of our seating. The bar had more light and seemed more comfortable as oppose to the dining area. The dining area had tables side by side each other and it was dark. They played hip hop, which was awesome! Love love the music! It really helped create the whole urban homely feel. Absolutely loved the ambience! I also liked sitting at the bar because I got to see the bartenders make really cool drinks :) One of the bartenders was very meticulous at making the drinks. Made me want one as well!   The food was awesome.  We definitely got excited and over-ordered for 2 people. We had:  Shock top  and Rolling Rock beer. I liked the shock top because it was sweet and had a nice citrus taste, much like a rickards white (as the server described it to us when we were deciding on what to order) $8 each  Tater Tots: This was absolutely my fave dish. When I first put this middle-size ball in my mouth and bit on it, it felt like an explosion of flavour and softness in my month. I described it to my bf as \"an orgasm in my mouth\" - haha...the texture on the outside was crispy, but the moment you crewed on it, it was so soft and flavourful - definitely amazeballs ! A+ ($7)  Buffalo Cauliflower - deep fried cauliflower essentially. This was okay. I really liked the ranch dressing and buffalo hot sauce that it came with. Although, the ranch dressing tasted like dill sauce, it was amazing to dip the cauliflower in both the sauces together. This was nothing special, but definitely a cool concept to deep fry your veggies - B ($8)  Chicken & Waffles - this was really good. Beautifully plated. Very sweet and flavourful, with a kick of spices that tasted indian. I liked that the chicken had no bones, unlike at other places where they serve the chicken thigh or drumstick. I have to say that it was better to eat the chicken and waffle separately for some reason. I would also say that the waffle wasn't warm, but if it was, it would have tasted a lot better. Overall, I give this a A- ($16)  Ribwich: When I first saw it, I found that it was a very small sandwich - a bit pricey at $13. Perhaps if it came with a side, it would feel like a better value. The beef short rib came as a patty. It was very moist and the rib honey jus made it a good pairing. However, I didn't really like the pickle with the sandwich. I could have done with other toppings on the sandwich, perhaps replacing the pickle with a cucumber. I found that the beef short rib didn't have flavour without the sauce. This was a so-so sandwich. I give it a B ($13)  Strawberry Shortcake Ice Cream Sandwich: I loved the presentation of this sandwich. Very nicely plated. I loved the strawberry cream on top of the cookie. There were real whipping cream and strawberries, which was delicious. The cookie itself was kind of tasteless - i would do with a different cookie. It wasn't very shortbread like. Maybe it was a healthy shortbread cookie without much butter? I liked the strawberry sherbet they used. Very refreshing. All in all, i would say Bakerbots would be a better choice for ice cream sandwiches and a faction of the price. However, I would come back and try the chocolate ice cream sandwich next time. B ($6)  Overall, I really liked this place and will definitely come back to try their weeknight specials such as the lobster roll on fridays. I also think this is a good place to come to for after dinner drinks and dessert. Love the hip hop music! The prices are fair and we definitely left full of happiness in our tummies!"}
{"text":"The burger was great. I'm not a fan of their fries... But man that was a good burger!"}
{"text":"I came for the deep dish pizza special but that was a disappointment. I guess my expectations were too high. The other foods here are great though, love the atmosphere, service is good, great selection of beers on tap, and the deserts are amazing."}
{"text":"Wasn't planning on going here, but my girlfriend and I stumbled upstairs, and were pleasantly surprised.   It's a hipster bar/ restaurant.. We were there around 9:00 pm, and we sat at the bar...   Had the \"Bones in a Bucket\". Dry rub rib dish (excellent), just wish there were more ribs included (I was hungry).. We also had the Brussels sprouts - very good. And the callilower - pretty good.   We finished off with an amazing ice cream dipped in crushed topping. Desert was 10/10.   Vibe was cool with hip-hop music, good beer... I'm American so bonus points for that.  Worth checking out.. Go with an open mind. Legit."}
{"text":"Great place to hang out after the game. They have bunch of craft beers on tap and even slushies (and boozy slushies). Also root beer on tap! Root beer floats!   The food here was alright. A few things we tried are the buffalo cauliflower (pretty tasty), the burger (it was really good but didn't come with anything), and the steak (the sauce was a little too strong and covered the beef flavour).   They also serve up some Sweet Jesus ice cream for dessert! Delicious..   Service was only ok. We weren't allowed to split the bill which sucked."}
{"text":"Home or the Brave hit a home run - for about $40 a person.  Great craft beer. On tap Root Beer as well!  I ate;  #1 Tuesday night beef Brisket Sandwich #2 Loaded fries /w manchego cheese  #3 Cheesy brussel sprouts #4 Chocolate icecream injected with peanutbutter rolled in peanuts #5 Smores ontop of Vanilla ice cream coated in chocolate + 1 draft beer.  Partner had the same sandwich and split the rest with myself - came to ~$40/pp.   Great service and decor to start. Open kitchen in the back is a good sign usually  - and it was as the chefs were having fun and seemed to be in a good mood.  Went on a Tuesday, which was great because it was a juicy beef brisket sandwich on special. Great bun, saucy and delicious.  Cheesy fries were delicious. Salty and crunchy. Ordered a side of chipolte mayo that was nice and thick; went well with the homemade ketchup as well.  Greens were a nice addition to the delicious, mouth watering, meat and fries.  Dessert was top notch. Not a huge list of options, but quality in their flavour and ingredients as well as great portions. The ice cream was huge, covered in nuts, and creamy! It's nice they give you a plate for it as you could never hold and eat it as a cone.  Same goes for the vanilla smores icecream bar - deeeeeelicious. Great LATE NIGHT too!  I'll be back to say the least."}
{"text":"I liked the feel of the restaurant, and I liked the beer I got. I would have gotten another but the keg ran out at 7:30 pm on a Thursday. I would go back to have drinks, but avoid the food. I ordered the Kentucky Handshake and my friends ordered the wing special (asian-inspired). The sandwich was unnecessarily greasy and way too bland. All I could taste was grease. Even the sauce couldn't help it. The chicken was fatty and full of gristle. I had to leave most of it on the plate. The wings were greasy and very small (maximum two bites of chicken per wing). Not worth the price of the food. I wasn't impressed."}
{"text":"Came back here for the 2nd time for their chicken and waffles. Thought it would be the same last year. But it isn't. The waffles were thick, but the ones I got yesterday were as flat as a fajita wraps. Giving a 2 stars for their lack of portion. Not worth $16. Shouldve gone to dirty bird or something for cheaper and better food."}
{"text":"I can remember checking out Home of the Brave within days of its opening and being suitably impressed. I've returned several times since and have never had a bad meal, and yet I somehow had never managed to sample their much-lauded hamburger.  We arrived just after noon on a Saturday and the place was pretty much empty. I quickly ordered the Home of the Brave Burger (House Ground AAA Ribeye, HOTB Pickle Mayo, House American Cheese, Tomato, Lettuce), although I was certainly tempted to once again eat their Philly Cheesesteak or Shaved Bologna sandwiches.  The burger arrived shortly and essentially looked like a hamburger from an ad campaign; ie it was perfect in terms of appearance. In terms of taste, the Home of the Brave Burger now ranks as one of the very best hamburgers in the city. The meat was juicy and beefy (and devoid of unnecessary filler!), while the condiments complemented it perfectly. (That HOTB Pickle Mayo is amazingly delicious.)  It was magnificent. I should've ended the meal there, but I couldn't resist ordering one of the Sweet Jesus soft-serve concoctions. I went with a peanut butter heavy invention (the website doesn't list their offerings, oddly enough) and it was just okay. The ice cream itself was very tasty, but the toppings around it were nothing too special.  I'd give the dessert three stars but that burger gets a full five stars, so the whole thing averages out to four. But that burger... I'm going to dream about that thing forever."}
{"text":"A really cool vibe type of atmosphere. The only reason why I'm not giving them a perfect score is the horrible lighting for people who actually want to eat. I had to use my iPhone light app to check the menu - but I guess it's their type of atmosphere their going for. I got the tater tots that were bomb, while my friends got sandwiches that were pretty big. I was a little surprised they JUST got a sandwich, then again, they probably have some theme going on. Great place to drink, gets pretty busy past 11PM. I did really like their gluten free apple cider though!   If you're looking for a dark cool vibing place to stop by for quick drinks and snack on king, reach."}
{"text":"It's a neat place with a unique decor that's definitely worth a visit for drinks and appetizers.  It's a loud place to have an intimate dinner.  You probably want to go here to grab drinks and socialize with a group of friends. I would definitely recommend their buffalo cauliflower.  The only negative item:  There is a bit too much American patriotism shown off as part of the decor - why not replace it with Canadian items instead?"}
{"text":"The hostess told us we couldn't do separate bills, but our waitress did it for us. I asked the hostess about the slushie drinks. I asked what the blue slushie tastes like, she simply said \"blue.\"   I had the brussels sprouts and they were very bland. I wouldn't recommend getting it. The corn bread is spicy. I was not into that.  I had the shaved bologna sandwich. It was good, but nothing to rave about.   I wouldn't come back. There are so many other restaurants in Toronto that are way better."}
{"text":"My company had a private holiday party here and it was great! The food was amazing, the staff was accommodating and the venue had a cool, outdoorsy vibe.  I had their cobb salad, their AAA steak, wings, ribs and many more and they all hit the spot! The restaurant itself was a bit small but given we had about 40 people standing around, we expected it to be a bit cramped.   Overall, a great experience having a party here!"}
{"text":"saw this place a lot on Instagram thought I'd try it out. Took a few friends and we were shocked at the size of the menu, roughly about 15 items. Do not be surprised the food here is amazing. I would definitely recommend the Home Of The Brave burger and the baby back ribs. The ribs were amazing."}
{"text":"Delicious, creative, well presented food.   Modern, cool decor with a bit of a divey (and I mean that in the best way,) grungey edge.   Amazzzzing music (lots of great alternative and hip hop mixes.)  Super friendly and personable service and staff.   Everything we tried was fantastic (and well priced) but the food highlights for me were:  Beer Battered Cauliflower: I have tried many spins on traditional cauliflower gone wrong but this ish is incredible. Crispy, delicious, and well seasoned and comes with some yummy sauces (hot sauce, and a dillish ranch.) I want more. Now.   Fried Bologna Sandwich: this ain't your grocery store bologna and I can assure you it is about 200 times better and more delicious. The bun was ridiculously soft and fresh and the homemade American cheese rocks. Seriously, this dish is a winner.   If you're craving funnel cake and don't want to go down to Wonderland, try the red velvet funnel cake. It did not last long on our table. I don't see many restaurants trying to take their own spin on funnel cake, so this is worth ordering just to try (I felt that ours was a SMIDGE dry but there were some really great flavours going on.)  Home of the Brave is one of the best new spots to come out of King St. Everyone I went with left raving about it. Seriously, check it out before it gets crazy busy during all open hours, La Carnita style."}
{"text":"Came here with a couple friends. Restaurant is small, typical Toronto size. Waitresses are friendly.   Appetizer: Buffalo Cauliflower, really good! A must try! Main: Shared: Buffalo Waffle, pretty good... but may be too sweet for some people.  Shared: Home of the Brave Burger... typical burger, nothing about it wowed me Desert: PBC icecream. Not as good as what I've been hearing about Sweet Jesus icecream. it melted too quickly."}
{"text":"Came here on a rainy Friday night and left super satisfied!  I had read about this place already and being that it's from the same owner that brought us La Carnita where the wait for a table is sooooo long, we called ahead to ask how long we can expect to wait for a table of two.  They said 30 minutes which we thought was ok so we walked over.  When we got there, we were able to snag two seats at the bar immediately (we were starving) so was pretty happy with that!  I'm always a bit wary of the pretentiousness of the joints in King West but Home of the Brave was refreshingly cool and low-key, not to mention quite reasonably priced considering its location and the quality of the food.  Our bartender/server was really friendly and she offered good recommendations for drinks and food.  Our food was served promptly and our glasses were always kept full.  We had the chicken handshake sandwich, fried bologna sandwich, lobster roll, and red velvet funnel cake (all shared, but a bit tricky to split the sandwiches which were generously stuffed).  All winners, but my favourite was the chicken handshake sandwich.  Having been pretty much raised on dim sum, the fried chicken foot didn't bother me one bit.  The fried bologna sandwich was delicious (not what you brought to school as a kid), with a generous serving of bologna on a soft eggy bun.  The lobster roll was also really tasty.  To be honest, we were full from our sandwiches, but the call of the red velvet funnel cake easily overcame my weak weak defense against dessert.  It was super tasty (though a bit too sweet for my tastes) and less greasy that what you'd find from a stand at Wonderland.  Came garnished with fresh berries which made me feel a tiny bit better about eating deep fried dough and sugar.  Would definitely come back here again...the rest of the menu looks pretty interesting and if our first visit was any indication, it should be really good too!"}
{"text":"My experience here was pretty mediocre. We had reservations for a group of 9, and were crammed into a tiny booth with two people sitting on (very uncomfortable) wooden chairs at the end of the table. I could see this happening if we'd just walked in, but with reservations I expect to be seated in a table that actually fits the number of people in the party.  I ordered the chicken and waffles. The presentation was great but I'm confused by the copious amount of sour cream on top. I felt like that was out of place in this classic dish. The breading on the chicken was also nearly rock hard so I had trouble eating it.  The decor of the restaurant is nice and I liked the atmosphere. I just wasn't happy with anything else here."}
{"text":"I love the atmosphere and decor of this place. The music was on point. It's a small place and it can get really busy on a Saturday night, so get there early if you want a table. I went with some friends and they really enjoyed their chicken and waffle dish. There wasn't much to choose from as a main dish if you're vegetarian or a pescatarian.  My main dish was an appetizer. I had the Buffalo cauliflower and it was ok. And it felt like we were being rushed to leave because they started to get really crowded at the bar. They do have different specials each day. It would have been nice to have the nachos that day, but they only serve it on Sundays. So I went home hungry."}
{"text":"We hadn't had dinner yet so after our skate session, we debated where to go. Four girls deciding = way too much deliberation. I swear 20+ restaurants were thrown out before agreeing on Home of the Brave.  The outdoor patio looks pretty nice for the summer time. Gotta love the slogan: join or die. Guess it goes with the American comfort food. The American flag at the booth we sat at was a nice touch.   Go upstairs because the main level houses Locals Only. Lucky we got there when we did because we made it just in time for last call. We put in an order right away and the food came out quickly.  Dessert's use Sweet Jesus's soft serve. Damn, they're popular.  - Ommegang hennepin saison ($8.00) - this saison is a golden ale. It was light, crisp yet full-bodied.  - Buffalo cauliflower ($9.00) - everyone seems to think it's a must order but the hot sauce didn't do much for me in terms of tastiness.  - Brussels sprouts ($7.00) - these were good. Love brussel sprouts when they're done right.  - Ribs ($20.00) - tender, moist, sticky; good late night ribs.  - Tater tots ($7.00$ - tater tots brings me back to my youth; these were waaaaaaaay better. Obviously.  - Mushroom mac ($11.00) - mac was goooooood. Just the right amount of creaminess.  - Cobb salad ($10.00) - I'm not a huge cobb fan to begin with (must be because of the iceberg lettuce) but this was half decent.  - Fluffer nutter ($6.50) - this was actually better than my visit to Sweet Jesus's actual spot. Maybe because you could eat it more leisurely/without having to worry about it falling completely apart/melting.  HOTB was a solid spot to share a few plates and have a couple drinks. Chill vibe, friendly staff and no fuss American food. Just like the American dream right?"}
{"text":"The good: the decor of the place was nice, display of the food was nice (picture worthy). But....  The bad: I am not sure why I did not enjoy the food at all. The Buffalo cauliflower was probably the best of the bunch. Crunchy and pairs well with the ranch dressing. The ribs were disappointing. I felt it was too burnt and didn't have much of a taste to it. The home of the brave burger was alright (to be honest it was more of a forgettable burger, can't even remember how it tasted). The corn bread was unspectacular:( however bad the dinner was though...  The ugly: the reason for coming to this place was actually the dessert (it's also the same place that opened sweet Jesus I believe). But I was so disappointed in what I ordered. I had the red velvet funnel cake. Everything about it just didn't seem right. Was too sweet, didn't taste the red velvetness, ice cream wasn't good. :(   Neutral: great for dates or groups of four. There seems to be lineups even during the weekdays so make sure to come early."}
{"text":"Place to go for a dessert (red velvet funnel is yummy) but I wouldn't recommend for dinner"}
{"text":"The food was pretty good but the service is extremely slow.  It seemed they were understaffed because we had about 4 different servers from the time we sat down till when we left.  I wouldn't recommend this place if you're in a rush that's for sure."}
{"text":"HOTB is just around the corner from my place and I've been meaning to try it for some time now... It seems to come up a lot in blogs with complementing reviews. However; I can't say I was very impressed. We were feeling peckish (not overly hungry) and stopped in on my way home for a quick bite.   We ordered the Home Of The Brave Burger, Brussels Sprouts & the Avocado Bacon Toast.  Nothing we had was necessary bad but certainly nothing to rave about. It seems like its a more suitable place to stop in for a drink while you're waiting for table at another restaurant to open up.   Tried the Evil Twin Nasty Trunks Sour IPA, it was quite tart... :)"}
{"text":"Did not like it. My girlfriend and I had two hamburgers, which were greasy. We had two French Fries which were overly salty. The quality clearly is not there. When asked they admitted they use the fake cheap stuff that is called American cheese instead of a quality actual cheese. It cost us over $40 for the greasy burgers.  Morale of the story: your best friend may be your best friend, but still she may know nothing about quality food.  Lesson for the day: sure, grease is flavourful, but not the kind of flavour you want."}
{"text":"Good spot for drinks and some food. I like the buffalo cauliflower, tater tots and the steak.  I'm all about cocktails - they make good manhattans, whiskey sours and martinis"}
{"text":"To be honest it was quite refreshing to look at a more scaled back menu with fewer options. We had the cauliflower to start and it was good, but I thought it was a bit overrated after all I had read on here. The sauces and batter were excellent, but the cauliflower was a bit underseasoned. I had the ribwich for my main which was very good but not very hot unfortunately. I loved how they did not skimp in either meat nor pickles, yet the pickles seemed quite mild as I barely tasted them at all even though there were so many. The drink menu was awesome, but I did not have a cocktail since I was with others who did not drink. We had root beer floats instead, and the ice cream was awesome and just the right amount with the root beer. A word of warning though: This is not A&W root beer you are getting. My companion described it as having almost a minty taste to it and he was right. Quite enjoyable nonetheless. This restaurant gets four stars because I haven't been anywhere else like it and don't think I will find anywhere else like it for a while! Great ambience too.. The detail in the decorations was awesome! I couldn't stop looking!  PS I went at 5:30 on a Thursday night and the place was empty so make sure to go early if you want to avoid the lines. Also, the $5 appetizer special if you buy all three does not seem to exist anymore, and their menu is a bit different than what is represented on the website. Some of the items are 'daily specials that you can only get on certain days of the week."}
{"text":"Had the burger and bologna sandwich. The bologna sandwich, while surprisingly good, was also very greasy, like that sinking feeling in your stomach after you eat it.   Took a while to get our food even tho it was 4pm, and only 2 other tables in the restaurant.   The vibe is pretty good with hip hop in the background."}
{"text":"Mediocre food and terrible service ... not sure what the hype is about, we left thoroughly disappointed ... we enjoyed the Buffalo Cauliflower and the Freedom Fries,  but all 4 of our mains were unremarkable at best, and our waitress was uninformed, unable to communicate and more than slightly rude."}
{"text":"Come here for drinks and dessert, not food. I got the chicken and waffles and my chicken was soggy (the crispy fried part on the outside) and the sauce tasted oily.  When my friends and I looked around the room no one was getting food, it was all drinking, and from what I can tell from the desserts they look delicious."}
{"text":"I went on a Friday night with a party of 20. It was for a friend's birthday.   First observation: This is a hipster restaurant.   Second observation: This place does not really accommodate large groups.   Third observation: The music selection was pretty dope.   They had us split into three pretty small U-shaped boths. I'd rather be seated in those long tables so people can get up to mingle or go to the bathroom without disrupting others. It was such an incovenience for everyone to be displaced each time someone needed to get up.   Because I had heard this was a tapas place I figured the portion sizes were going to be small. I was pleasantly surprised that some weren't. My boyfriend & I had ordered the Crab Cakes to start. I'd say they were pretty good but I felt the sauce at the bottom of the pan made them very soggy. My boyfriend ordered the Broccoli & Grits as his main & THAT was delicious! The portion size was very good & half way through my boyfriend was getting full. We also had the Tater Tots which I think could use a little less garlic. Everything came out rather quickly for a large group like ours which was surprising. I decided to order the Brussel Sprouts. It didn't come out as fast as everything else & the waiter took notice & was kind enough to remove the charge off the bill. I felt the brussel sprouts were cooked perfectly but it was heavily coated in the toasted mustard seeds & that cheese sauce. It could have used much less of the mustard seed.   A friend had ordered the NY Striploin which was HUMONGOUS!!!! 20oz is no joke. He shared a bit of it with us & it was seasoned well. He did order it medium rare & it came out a little rarer than requested but it was still delicious.   Dessert was meh. We were offered a peach pie that was not on the menu & the only thing I liked about it was the caramel sauce. I didn't think it was appropriate to call it a pie because it was nothing close to a pie. It didn't have a flakey crust & the filling kind of tasted like canned peaches that were just heated up. It was a very soggy rendition of a peach pie.   The alcoholic drinks didn't disappoint. $12 for a cocktail to me is a little much but you do get a good serving of alcohol - they do not skimp out!   The service, I have to say, was superb. Our waiter was kind enough to split the bill for our table & he was so attentive. He was very personable & as I said, he recognized the lapse in speed for our brussel sprouts & immediately addressed it. He ensured we always had water in our glasses & checked on us enough but not too much.   Overall I think the food is definitely overpriced, over-seasoned & not really on par with their whole \"American-style\" mantra. I felt the service was exceptional & truly enjoyed our server.   I give it a two stars solely based on the food.  I don't think this is a place I'd have a hankering for & I probably wouldn't go to this place either if I was in the area."}
{"text":"VIBE  Take La Carnita's vibe and place it on King Street. It's a new hot spot but without the pretentious-ness and is a perfect pit stop on a bar/snack crawl in the King West nabe (i.e. across the street is Valdez, then you could go over to Gusto's rooftop and Spirit House all within the block).   The music is the same as at La Carnita but  isn't as loud; the drinks are just as boozy if not boozier than Carnita. I'm a fan of the open window at the front where you can look out into King Street.   WE ATE/DRANK Taylor Corrigan, formerly on the bar at Origin, is now bar manager at HOTB and he's doing an incredible job. He personally made me The Journalist (gin, cointreau, lemon, etc) for me (I'm a lucky gal, what can I say?). But what's really cool about their cocktail menu is that they have cocktails made by guest bartenders from some of the best bars in the US (Drumbar, Employees Only, etc). They also have rootbeer floats!  I also like that the cocktail menu isn't five pages long. It's a short selection so it's easy to pick and choose.   Of course, we had the signature fried bologna sandwich. It's warm and hot and the mozzarella is house made. This is not the sandwich I was throwing out from my brown paper bag in elementary school, that's for sure.   The Kentucky Fried Chicken Handshake sandwich looks as creepy as it seems and apparently, many people hide the hand under a napkin on a plate (we did it!). But the sandwich is mo-fo hearty. You will not leave hungry that's for sure. On King St., it's a good price point too.   I have heard good things about: the johnnycake, the lobster roll (you can purchase one to three rolls for different price points) and  the bones in a bucket.   OBLIGATORY CATCHY REMARK Shouldn't I be a little more patriotic to Canada?"}
{"text":"awesome. great food, great old-timey cocktails! get the eye-popping Kentucky handshake chicken sandwich, the bucket of ribs (you'll need a bib), and the tater tots. forget the Philly cheese steak - way too small, and the salads are really for your guilt."}
{"text":"This place BLOWS!!  We heard good things so we decided to try if out. We were greeted by incredibly load music which was not suitable for the small sit down dining venue. The service was horrible, our angry I-hate-my-job waitress did not explain the menus at all and probably could have mentioned that the chicken burger comes with a giant chicken leg, claws and all, sticking out of it. I ordered the Philly cheesesteak, I got chewy meat topped with 2 slices of processed cheese on a wonder bread hot dog bun. I asked to send it back and the waitress stormed off without even asking if I would like anything else to eat instead. If you want to have dinner having to yell your entire conversation to your partner and eat some pretty lousy food and get some horrible service then this is the place for you!"}
{"text":"A cool hangout spot. Lots of interesting dishes, \"vintage, they don't make'm anymore\" kind of cocktails and hard to find hard liquor.   They serve smaller dishes that are good for sharing! We had the 44oz steak, ribs, chicken burger, Waldorf salad and brussels sprouts. My favourite out of all of those was the chicken burger--the chicken was juicy, the leg was a funny surprise and the sauce on the side was nice. Great flavours, not too heavy, had just the right amount of grease to keep you wanting more!  Reason why it's 3 stars: the dishes (except for the chicken burger) were not new or had any surprising elements. Perhaps I had too big of an expectation when I saw it in the list of \"up and coming\" restaurants here"}
{"text":"Loved this place.   I am not particularly cool or trendy (read: I don't wear skinny jeans, large amounts of plaid or own a bicycle), but I immediately felt cooler by being in this place. The decor and design are awesome. It's also completely unpretentious.  The fried bologna sandwich is UNREAL. A slight step up from the two slices on Wonderbread that I used to trade for a half eaten snack pack in the lunchroom as a kid.  Ribs are also awesome (you get beef and pork in the same order). Definitely order these if you're on a date, they're not messy at all**  Only disappointment were the tater tots - nothing special about them. I also might be bias because my grandma used to make me tater tots...and she was the absolute shit, so I think I just associate her awesomeness with Tater Tots, and any other version can't compare.  **My face looked like I dove head first into a mud puddle after eating these. You should absolutely not order them if you're on a date."}
{"text":"I brought a group here and they were very accommodating by allowing me to reserve for 20 people on a weekday evening. The service was friendly and efficient. Most of my guests enjoyed the food and the experience. Unfortunately I was not a fan of the food. Maybe it was because I can only eat so much fried food, or that I was really looking forward to the funnel cake and it ended up tasting stale and nothing like what you would find at Wonderland. I can't fault their service, ambiance or menu. But I will not return because the food did not appeal to me. I tried the fried cauliflower, tater tots, ice cream cookie, funnel cake, burger and brussels sprouts. And they were okay. Nothing stood out. But many of my guests did plan to return. So there you have it."}
{"text":"Not really much to say. Cool atmosphere. Mediocre burger. Way too greasy and not large enough. Crab cakes were tasteless and didn't have character."}
{"text":"I tried a few different dishes and they were all tasty and interesting with the exception of the Freedom Fries which were tasteless.  We had the cobb salad, freedom fries, chicken n waffles n the kentucky burger.  ALERT: The kentucky burger is a fried chicken leg WITH THE FOOT on a bun. Gross!!  The rest of it was good. The coated soft ice creams were pretty cool. One of them was coated with crushed cinnamon toast crunch. Ill never eat ice cream at home without crushed cereal again.  The atmosphere was like a restaurant-lounge. 90s hip hop and reggae played along with some other pop-hip hop mixes   Its super loud n too dim in there like you would expect at most restaurant-bars downtown.  The staff was ok. We got our food super fast!  I would recommend this place.  FYI there is street parking."}
{"text":"Went in for a beer, just a beer nothing fancy.... I go to sit down and the bar stool is heavy as a bag of cement, It drags on the floor making a very loud noise as I struggle to pull it forward to the bar. I plop myself down sit on the stool and it wobbles... I move over to the next bar stool and it's just as heavy and just as loud on the floor.  Awesome start...  The bearded bartender (and I mean that in the nicest way) brings over a menu and doesn't look very pleased, as he goes to drop the menu in front of me it's laminated side makes it glide into my lap in into the floor.  \"Sorry about that bro\" he says I respond; \"No worries it's okay I got it\" \"Right on boss\" Oh were doing cute nick names for one another are we? Well \"grizzy\" let's do this.  I hadn't even read the menu yet and he began asking me what I wanted...  At this point I had already had enough of this hipsters gum flapping and just wanted a beer, I ordered 1 single pint of Coors Banquet. Not a Guinness that takes 8 minutes, not a Long Island iced tea cause I was feeling tropical. Coors Banquet...  The St.Louis Cardinals fan bartender then poured me one of the worst poured beers I'd ever seen in my life, I tried to bring this to \"grizzy's\" attention but he was too busy talking skateboards and Jared Leto sightings with his friends at the other end of the bar. He then began playing hide and go seek with me leaning his head behind the bar taps so he \"couldn't see me\". FML  The drink was warm but I powered through, When the banana's went brown I finally got his attention to settle up with a bill, \"$10 bucks\" he says.   \"I thought the menu said $8?\"  \"Oh okay $8 then..\" I gave him and $10 and got out with whatever dignity I had left, I'll never return here and I'll absolutely insist to all my friends and family to never visit this establishment. I work to hard to receive such trash service like this and during the day too when it's empty.    I just...wanted.....a beer..."}
{"text":"Well let's start with the good. The place is super cute. They were playing Mos Def. The staff was friendly and attentive. They had Woodchuck Cider on tap.  Let's move over to the okay. We started with the Buffalo Cauliflower as an app and it was decent. Nothing in the batter gave it a special kick which I think would have helped the dish as cauliflower is pretty bland. The ranch and buffalo hot dipping sauces were average.  Next, what was not so good. I had the Kentucky Fried [Horror] Handshake. Now the name of the restaurant took on a whole new meaning here! I felt some fear! I am not squeamish when it comes to food, but I would have liked a heads up about the monster talon that sticks out of this sandwich. See the photo. Hence I have added a word to the dish's title that I suggest they also add to their menu. More damningly, like a lot of horror shows, this sandwich was big on effects but weak on substance. There wasn't a lot of chicken but there was a ton of unappetizing greasy batter that had very little flavour other than oil. I did not finish it. My fellow dinners were also both underwhelmed with the shaved boloney sandwich and the cheese steak.  I wish this place all the best because it seems cute, but based on what I tasted, they've got some work to do."}
{"text":"Second time here... Not satisfied with the chicken and waffles for such a price. The handshake burger is alright. Tasted better when I tried it about two years ago.   I ordered my c&w without sour cream on it... I took a bite from it and sent it back cause I realized they had forgotten to not add it... Funny. Table next to us ordered c&w and after she took my food i had already taken a bite from she walked to the back for a few seconds and brought the same plate to the table next to us. I'd be careful eating here. That's some real garbage serving people food that's already been contaminated. Not that anythings wrong with me. I know Id sure be pissed as hell to find someone else had already touched the food other than the cooks.   Just a little story to warn yall"}
{"text":"Some really unique and tasty dishes. Poke, Handshake and Buffalo Cauliflower were all awesome. Chef there is super chill and chatted with our table as well"}
{"text":"Went here for late night desserts.  I had the funnel cake.  I asked for some coffee but they didn't have any so I asked our server if he could recommend another beverage to counteract the sweetness of the dessert.  He said he'd pick something out and said he won't make it too expensive.  I can't remember what kind of drink it was but it was sweet and not very good.  When I get the bill I also notice it was $14.  Not too expensive hey?  He was pretty friendly though so despite the not so great first experience I'm willing to go back again."}
{"text":"Inconsistent.  Food - great ribs and cauliflower (tangy, sweet, with a little bit of kick), but the cornbread was awful (a tasteless dense lump, slathered in an unnecessary sauce)  Service - ranged widely from friendly & attentive (our water glasses were never half full, to indifferent & forgetful (our steak never arrived, and they didn't ask about the untouched cornbread).  Atmosphere - great decor and space, but really really loud. You have to practically shout at the person across from you. And this was on a random Wednesday.  Probably wouldn't go back. But if a friend really wanted to go, I'd agree."}
{"text":"I've been to Home of the Brave three times.  The first visit, I went solely in response to the allure of the Red Velvet Funnel Cake, which is... I mean,  you say, \"Red Velvet Funnel Cake,\" and like, angels sing, doors open, and champagne flows in one's mind, right?  And believe me, it delivers on your expectations.  But it also exceeds them.  It's one thing to make a Red Velvet Funnel Cake.  It's another thing entirely to pair it with house made bourbon vanilla ice cream (the bean, not the sweet, sweet brown liquor), and macerated strawberries and blueberries.  It's amazing.  I'll continue to come back for it.  In fact I think the desserts are the strongest thing about this place.  I've also ordered the oreo ice cream sandwich, billed as cookie dough ice cream between two chocolate chip cookies, rolled in something called \"oreo cookie crumble.\"  Which isn't accurate.  Or at least it's only accurate if you accept, \"entire goddamn glorious oreos, some of which are sort of cracked in half\" as a crumble, per se.  Let's be clear here: this is delicious ice cream packed with a ton of chewy cookie dough, stuffed between two delicious cookies, and then rolled sideways in an impenetrable wall of oreos so imposing, that it's like the cookie equivalent of something preventing cultural progress in the West Bank.  This thing is terrifying, and so, so good.  I split it with another fully grown man, and when the server asked me how it was, I STILL accused her of \"trying to kill me with cookie.\"  Jesus.  Sadly the rest of the menu isn't as remarkable.  Everything here's a nouveau spin on an American niche classic, and it's all solid, but nothing really stands out and it all feels like you're being punched in the gut.  I heard tremendous things about the bologna sandwich, but honestly it was just a massive stack of too much bologna given a bit of a grilling, then stacked and layered with way too much very average American cheese and some pistachios.  It was... fine?  But it was too much food, too heavy and one-note to be enjoyable, and I didn't feel very good about it.  We came once on a Tuesday to continue my quest for a passable, authentic lobster roll, and while their Romantic Atlantic lobster roll's fresh, well proportioned, and a good value, it's difficult to taste the lobster under the overpowering flavors of lemon and dill.  It packs a lot of taste, but it's not what I'm looking for out of a lobster roll.  In fact I'm not sure it's what anyone's looking for out of a lobster roll.  The Buffalo Cauliflower's deep fried quite nicely, crispy and not greasy at all, but like many things here it was very one-note: this is a largely flavorless vegetable coated in a largely flavorless batter, then dipped in hot sauce that would kill any taste anyways.  I'm a huge chicken and waffles fan, which HOTB offers on Thursdays.  A friend and I stopped by to try their take on it, and while the base components were pretty strong, it all came doused in a sour cream sauce that was just totally unnecessary and served to overpower everything else.  It made what could have been a well balanced and delicious main into a total bomb.  Don't get me wrong, I love me some heavy trashy food done right, but I feel like they're trying for that a little too hard here.  A few adjustments to make the heavier dishes a bit more approachable wouldn't compromise the theme, but would likely add considerable staying power and appeal.  I'd like to say, \"This is amazing drinking food,\" but it's not even that.  It's all just really, really heavy.  The service is good, the music is solid, and I love that they're willing to offer spotlighted cocktails from other restaurants, giving credit to each drink's heritage.  That's a REALLY cool idea, and some of those imports have been really good!  The in-house cocktail offerings are inventive, and largely successful, but they're nothing remarkable per se.    Is HOTB worth the hype?  Probably not.  But it's solid, provided you're aware that you're going to leave feeling like you've eaten a fistful of lead shot.  But man, those desserts.  Really, really stellar desserts.  At the very least, swing by for those."}
{"text":"This place is awesome. Great food, great music. Sat at the chefs bar and watched them rock it out. Second time I've been here and I will definitely be back. Can't say enough. Worth the drive from the suburbs."}
{"text":"Home of the Brave was okay- pretty affordable for King West. With 1 dessert, 2 shared items, 2 main items and 2 drinks, it was $75.  The music was WAY too loud though, and it was really hard to hear the person across from me- and this was at 6pm when the restaurant isn't booming yet. Our service was fine, nothing to write home about.   The food was decent, I'd go again but it wouldn't be my first choice in the area after work. The fries and brussel sprouts were pretty subpar but the sandwiches were good, as was the homemade ice cream. I love La Carnita, so I think my expectations were likely too high for it's little brother, which is why I would give it 3 stars instead of 2."}
{"text":"Here's he scoop. Great tunes. Awesome vibe. Had the ribs. Amazing. Perfectly cooked. Tender with just enough chew and charred to mmmmmmmmmmm. And the sauce! Sweet with a touch of smoke. OMG. Friends had the burger. Medium. Like the best Big Mac ever. And the chicken n waffles. Well fried and infused with a sweet maple yum. Drool.  Appies. Get the buffalo cauliflower and the Brussels sprouts.  Cocktails. Like the Gold Rush (bouton and honey syrup).  A hedonistic sensory cornucopia. Come here!"}
{"text":"As someone who goes to a lot of different bars (thanks, beer passport!), I spend a lot of time mulling over bar decor. What would a bar look like if I decorated it? Home of the Brave, basically. Plus, the theme doesn't hurt.  While they don't have a patio, they do have excellent people watching, since you're overlooking Queen West one story up.  I popped in on a whim and discovered they had cocktail slushies. I didn't know that's what I've always wanted, but it's what I've always wanted.  The tater tots weren't what you want if you're looking for the classic tater tots, but if you'd like to eat delicious tater tots while still pretending to be a respectable adult, these are for you."}
{"text":"I love this place! The atmosphere is very comfy and filled with the typical hipster Edison bulb lighting and vintage knick-knacks that are very popular today. The dining room is rather small and doesn't have that many tables so it is understandable that they don't take reservations. We had drinks at the bar while we wait for a table and the waitress was nice enough to bring a couple more stools for my party and made a little more room at the bar with the cooperation of other customers. The music was great (a selection of 80's pop, including a healthy dose of Phil Collins), but I agree with everyone that the music is way too loud and makes for difficult socializing.  The cocktails were all very tasty and some had a great boozy kick. They even have a slushy machine that dispenses Jack & Coke and some Zombie punch concoction. The beer menu consists of American brews including my favorite Anchor Steam Beer. The bar along the window that opens up to King Street was strangely very high or the barstools not tall enough, so it's funny to see people sitting there with their drinks or food at almost chin level.    After getting a table which had a nice view of the open kitchen we had a sampling of some really great food. The fried cauliflower (buffalo cauliflower) made for a great starter and perfect for sharing. It came with a creamy buffalo sauce and ranch sauce for dipping. The broccoli and grits was also very tasty and I am not a big fan of grits. The fried chicken sandwich was great and the foot sticking out of it is a witty touch -- you could still bite the tasty crunchy batter off of it. The fried bologna sandwich was yummy too, the stack of bologna was sliced incredibly thin which gave it a nice delicate texture and went well with the cheese and fluffy and well seasoned bun. Many tables ordered the red velvet funnel cake so decided to follow suit and it was a great choice. I especially like the bourbon vanilla ice cream that came with it.  The food and service is so good, especially given that this is such a new restaurant. I will definitely come back again."}
{"text":"Came here on a Thursday evening - it was really packed and loud. I'm not a fan of the dark, loud type of atmosphere but it seems a lot of people are. My friend and I shared the chicken and waffles, corn bread, and some sort of baloney sandwich. Ok - the baloney sandwich was so delicious. Probably not worth $11, but it was filled with baloney in a buttery, toasted bun. The corn bread had some jalapeño in it, which added an interesting kick, though I wasn't a huge fan. The chicken and waffles was...decent. The waffles were not fluffy but the fried chicken was pretty good. The dessert was definitely the highlight - this is what gets HOTB 4 stars. Their soft serve is to die for! We had this huge cone ($6) covered with pretzels and there were green apple bits inside - sweet, sour, salty - what a great flavour combo. I would come here again for the soft serve. It really lived up to its name \"Sweet Jesus\" haha..."}
{"text":"What to try?  Their cocktails! I came in here with no expectations. Thought it's the typical cocktails but to my surprise, the moment I took the first sip, my eyes widened. Their cocktails are easy to drink and yummy. Especially if you're into less of the alcohol taste or have a sweet tooth when it comes to cocktails, this might be a place you want to try out.   I really liked the Bonita Applebum. If you are a fan of cucumber and elderflower...then you'll love this drink. The refreshing taste of cucumber in water is great, now in an alcohol drink? What more can you ask for?? I think it's the combination of lemon, honey, cucumber and rose which did the trick!  The other one I tried was dirty money (talk about the cool names right??) and I thought it was good too! Loved the touch of pineapple in this. But personally I'm not too big of a fan of tequila so I wasn't jumping with joy over this drink. However I liked how they were creative and used lemongrass in the drink. I think the next time I go, I'll try crystal clear Coco Chanel or straight flossin est good fortune, Toronto!   Last tip?   Sit by the bar to see the wall plastered with American dollar bills. It's kind of cool, you see people write comments on the dollar bills and it's interesting to see what people write. Haha you might be surprised!"}
{"text":"I have been here a handful of times and have truly enjoyed myself each time. The overall atmosphere is casual, industrial chic, filled with your typical King West crowd. I was lucky enough to enjoy their American Thanksgiving special menu which was perfection!   My most recent trip to HOTB was on a Friday night. They were pretty full so I sat up at the bar for about 15 minutes until there was a free table. The bartender who served me had the most amazing twirly moustache and made a fantastic drink.   After moving to our table we ordered some cornbread, it had some spice/kick to it with a sprinkling of pancetta. Great starter to begin our meal. We then ordered the philly cheese steak sandwich, bologna sandwich, ribwich, and tater tots.  Tater Tots are a tried-and-true item. I've had them almost every time I go to HOTB. The inside of the tater tot is like mashed potatoes that melt in your mouth!  The Bologna sandwich is another crowd pleaser, I've never met anyone who has turned down this classically delicious sandwich.   The Ribwich was a little sub-par/boring. It was alright, nothing amazing.   All I have to say about the Philly Cheese Steak is that it was magic in my mouth. A++  To finish off the meal we ordered a cookie dough ice cream sandwich. Perfect way to end off the night!   Overall, Home of the Brave has never disappointed me, and the cherry on top would be the Kanye West playlist we listened to all night!"}
{"text":"The cauliflower appetizer is the second best thing on the menu, right after the chicken and waffles!  both a must have"}
{"text":"The recently open Home of the Brave (@theHOTB) by TUM alum / La Carnita (post here) Andrew Richmond... glad that all the exciting restaurant opening up on King West like Valdez across the street. No reservation and we told that there'll be a 45mins wait (leave phone# n come back) but end up being only around 20mins.   Love the urban vibe with the steel walls, subway tiles, industrial finishes and blackboard beams. I especially love the lights hanging by the bar   The menu consist of American comfort food, offering original takes on regional specialties and homestyle cooking that we Canadian probably forgot or never seen before.  Have to say I love everything including the open kitchen but it was so hot in there when I went last week and with no AC, it's difficult to enjoy our meal fully when we are sweating like pigs    Zombie Slushie ~ three type of rum, grapefruit, pineapple, bitters & cinnamon syrup ~ This was an extremely strong cocktail, definitely worth your dollar worth.  Zombie Slushie: Three Types of Rum, Grapefruit, Pineapple, Bitters, Cinnamon Syrup   Brooklyn Lager $7   Tater Tots $5 ~ Crispy Potatoes. Cheese, gravy, herbs ~ This was almost like gnocchi, so crispy and soft at the same time. It was perfect with the extra thick and yummy gravy.   Fried Bologna Sandwich $9 ~ bologna, house made American Cheese, toasted pistachios, spicy sour cream ~ Love it since the preview at #DOS and this totally reminds me of lunches back in high school but this is a fancier version for the grown up me.  ~ Def an A+ for Executive Chef Johnathan Hamilton with this overstuffed sandwich with altering layers of cheese and thinly shaved deli meat.   Kentucky Fried Handshake Sandwich $13 ~ Fried Chicken, Mango, Iceburg Lettuce, Louisiana Hot Sauce ~ Best presentation ever, pictures of this dish online everywhere was what attracted me to this place. ~ Give it a handshake and pull it off before biting into the moist, juicy and well seasoned chicken with the extra crispy coatings.  ~ Love how the hot sauce is served on the side so that the skin or bun doesn't get soggy, although the chicken is very flavorful the sauce is very much needed.    Johnny Cake w/ Smoked Trout $14 ~ cornmeal Griddle Cake w/ Savoury Cream, ~ A Rhode Island staple, this was new to me and I'm not sure I really like it. I usually love sweet and savory combination but somehow I don't like this version... somehow, it's too sweet and not salty enough, the maple syrup drenched griddle cake took over the smoked trout flavor.  ~ We end up just eating the smoked trout with the savory cream.    Bones in a Bucket $18 ~ Kansas City Rubbed Beef and Pork Ribs, Ranch Dressing, Celery, Carrot ~ This was fall off the bone good with a thick coating of sauce, it was one of the best beef ribs.    Would have love to try their desserts and some of the cocktails but it was so hot that we lost appetite.   Verdict : ~ Love it here but with it wasn't so hot, will hopefully go back when it's colder. ~ Love the decor, the service and the atmosphere"}
{"text":"Had a great dinner here with amazing cocktails and mind blowing soft serve ice creme deserts. Cool hip spot."}
{"text":"The food is great! If you are looking for comfort food this is the place. They have one of the best philly cheese sammies I have ever had. This place can get really busy really quickly so you may have to wait but it is totally work it. Cant wait to go back!"}
{"text":"We went for my wife's birthday after seeing their posts on Instagram and taste of Toronto and it did not disappoint.   The food selection is small but the flavours and the service is unreal. We had several apps to start.   - corn bread  - tater tots  - Buffalo cauliflower   I'd recommend any and all of them. Their unique plating make a nice little touch. The main courses were great and perfect time. The drinks selection is nice and a good assortment of beers.   Over all. Amazing experience. We'll be going back on Monday to get the mushroom Mac and cheese!"}
{"text":"Came here before the jays game (let's go blue jays!)   We started our night with the cauliflower and Brussels sprouts. The sprouts were flavourful and creamy. Delicious. The cauliflower was crunchy and creamy as well, faint taste of spice. They take more of an acquired taste I think to really \"enjoy\".   To the mains (which don't come with any sides), we ordered the 76er cheesesteak and the Kentucky handshake sandwich.   The 76er was incredibly delicious. It comes open face and is not a sandwich. Requires a knife and fork but god damn, so good. The handshake came with a full chicken leg, which requires some elbow grease to remove, but again.. delicious. Would order both again for sure.   For dessert, they offer Sweet Jesus ice cream. I have reviewed 2 of their locations in the past, so I'll leave it at that. I did not try any from here.   I will definitely be here again.. great experience with the staff and food. A for sure must try in the city."}
{"text":"My jury is still out on this one. The burger was good but it would have been nice if the waiter mentioned that it didn't come with anything so I could have known to order a side...which I did when I realized.  The one guests meal came out 10 minutes ahead of the other two. It was ok but for this neighborhood I think you have to be something special and this wasn't.  I'll try one more time and change my review of its better."}
{"text":"3.5  Came here the other night for dinner and drinks with a friend. It was good but a little pricey and VERY American!! I asked if they had caesars and she said no just bloody marys. No thanks!   I ended up just getting a glass of wine and my friend got a whiskey sour which was very well made and quite strong! (I tried some)  For dinner she got the burger and I got the crab cakes salad. She kept going on about how unbelievable her burger was. My salad was really good I just felt guilty eating something so fried! But no complaints here.  We shared fries they were meh. Not a huge portion for $7, could easily get more for less at a fast food chain.   They have a Sweet Jesus menu for ice cream desserts which was pretty cool. They sounded mouthwatering but I couldn't put more junk food into my body.  Service was alright, our waitress was nice but would disappear sometimes.  It was also very LOUD!! But with that in mind, we were also right below a speaker, and there were two VERY loud men beside us. Once they left it quieted down. The ambience was very cool though and I liked the American decor.  Would I return? For drinks and apps sure. It's in a great neighbourhood."}
{"text":"Food ***1/2 Service ***** Ambience ****  Comfort food and a great menu of beers gives this spot a thumbs up in my opinion - especially in the winter.    Make sure you try the beer battered cauliflower and Memphis ribs.  Both delicious and must haves.  The servers go out of their way to make you feel welcome and are prompt and courteous throughout your stay.   Bravo!"}
