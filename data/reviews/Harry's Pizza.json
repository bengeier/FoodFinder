{"text":"If you're from New England and nostalgic for the pizza you grew up eating, come here. Nuff said."}
{"text":"Pizza was not just crispy, was burnt.  Black ring on outer edge, could not taste sauce or cheese as overcooked.  Salad was good.  $32 for pizza and a salad."}
{"text":"After having traveled extensively throughout New Jersey,  have to say this is far better!!!  Give it a shot."}
{"text":"The pizza is really good. You can tell the sauce is homemade you can see chunks of tomatoes in it and it's perfectly sweet. The crust is delicious and crispy just how I like it and the cheese is great. The pizza only comes in small or large, get the large cause it's so good. Wish they delivered."}
{"text":"Excellent pizza. I love the tomatoes and garlic flavor.  Most people go crazy about cheap cheese but I love the well done crust and tomato flavor. It is a distinctively different pizza than you'd get from domino's or most local pizza places. Try it you will definitely love it cause it's real pizza!!"}
{"text":"I adore Harry's. It is the best pizza in the Southland. Nothing else comes close. We get the Tuesday Nite Special--even when it is not Tuesday. Servers are always friendly, and keep drinks filled and things moving. For a very busy place, the service is great. If you're coming on a weekend night plan to wait, but it is worth it."}
{"text":"Read the reviews and gave Harry's a try. The crust was tough and dry. The sauce tasted like it came from a jar.  They were very busy. Maybe trouble with the ovens."}
{"text":"Great pizza place.  We eat lunch here once a week where we get the personal pizza, salad and drink combo.  Nice, crispy thin crust.  Fun atmosphere for dinner as well."}
{"text":"I really eating at Harry's Pizza!  The pizza kitchen is all out in the open so it's kind of cool that you get to watch the chefs make and bake your pizzas. The salad was absolutely amazing!  And the build your own pizza was even better (although it can get pretty pricey if you want a lot of different toppings, which range in price from $1.25-$1.90 for a small pizza or $1.95-$2.85 for the large pizza)!  The servings are HUGE! The salads are big enough for two people and the small size pizza has more than enough slices for two.  The downside about Harry's Pizza is that you will have you wait for a table, unless you go super early or super late.  (Also the floors were very slick for some reason that night.)"}
{"text":"Pizza was great, service was great, I would recommend and will revisit.  Only downside was, no draft beer, but not a deal breaker."}
{"text":"Awesome!! Casual, friendly, great service but most importantly, delicious pizza!!! Best in town!!!"}
{"text":"Harry's Pizza is the best pizza in the Pittsburgh area!  All the favors come together with all the fresh ingredients. The house salad is delicious and big enough for two or more people!  We love the homemade dressing!!!"}
{"text":"I eat more pizza that the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles and some people swear by Harry's Pizza, but I don't.  Pizza doesn't have much flavor.  Not a fan of the mushrooms.  White pizza is bland.  Very expensive for what you get.  Extremely overpriced.  However, you can order alcohol and the atmosphere is nice, very pleasing aesthetics and the owner is a nice guy.  Too many high schoolers making the food I believe, which compromises the consistency and quality of the food.  Salad is very good and looks like it should be on a cooking magazine based on the presentation.  Servers have been great every time.  Nice spot to grab and drink and pizza for lunch, but don't expect anything above average from your pie.  Take it from a true pizza connoisseur:  \"At Harry's, don't have Great Expectations like Pip, because Miss Havisham ain't coming to bring you green dough or good pie.\"  You will get tasteless dough and average-at-best pie."}
{"text":"A little disappointing.  Fresh, but not as flavorful as I had hoped.  Crust was well cooked, but a bit chewy, and a little bland.  The sauce was just ok as well - slightly spicy, not sweet.  The pepperoni was definitely the highlight.  Mixed results from the rest of the family.  My parents both ate less than their normal pizza intake, while my sister and niece both really liked it (although they are the ones that recommended it!)"}
{"text":"Far and away, the best pizza in Pittsburgh's South Hills, and that's no small feat. My wife and I ended up here by chance and decided to give it a try.   Harry's has a thinner, crispy crust, tasty sauce, and high quality toppings. We got our large pie with 1/2 meatballs and 1/2 pepperoni, and every bite made our eyes roll back into our heads.   It was pretty busy, but the wait staff gave excellent tag-team service. In spite of the crowd, we never waited for drinks or anything else.   We also ordered a house salad which was fresh and yummy. The house vinaigrette dressing was outstanding. We got a large, which was huge. We were worried that it would be too much, but it was so good that we ended up easily polishing it off.   Never heard of Harry's? Never tried it? Do something about that. Now."}
{"text":"This isn't pizza. Thin burnt crust. Crust tasted more like stale bread.  Extra toppings were expensive and minimal. Service was terrible."}
{"text":"Great local pizza place! Clean and comfortable atmosphere. The meatball, zucchini & extra cheese is our favorite pizza. The crust is thin, but holds up well. If you haven't tried it, you should! The owner is extremely nice, and supports local law enforcement, fire, etc.  On any given day you can see first responders, teams of kids and parents after a local game, and groups of friends meeting for good food and laughs. If you're really lucky, you'll get Stacey as your waitress! She's the short, spunky golden tan girl with a smile you can spot from across the street. But the entire staff is friendly and prompt. We have to give Two thumbs up for Harry's!"}
{"text":"While I did enjoy the environment, also the small bar located right in the front to eat at was nice and welcoming. There was a small wait that made me hungry seeing all the piping hot pizzas being served. The house salad was great all the diffrent greens and topings were outstanding. While the homemade salad dressing was a little spicy, not sure what made it spicy but I did enjoy it. I was glad it came on the side though or it would be almost to much with all the topings.  The crust on the pizza was very good for a thin pizza. I enjoyed the crunch but my husdand did not eat the crust he said it was way to hard for him. The only thing that dissapointed me and him was the sauce no flavor just freash tomatos it seemed. You really needed the red peper and parm to spice up the sauce/pizza. The hot italian sausage was outstanding I really enjoyed that.  Of course that's what my husband ordered. I would go back. All around a great place the service was outstanding it felt welcoming and warm. Not the best pizza but it will do."}
{"text":"I grew up in NYC and have been looking for good pizza in pittsburgh for 15 years, I finally found something I really like.  If your looking for NY style pizza Harry's is as close as it gets.  It not the same but it works for me.  I recommed checking it out."}
{"text":"I've ordered takeout at Harry's 5 times since moving to the area about s year ago.  Pizza is good and salads are better than average.   The service has been better than average until yesterday.  I ordered s pizza and was told it would be ready  in 30 minutes.  I got there when it was to be ready (about 6 pm), and was told that it's \"not quite ready yet\" and to have a seat. When I sat down I observed a number of pizza boxes on top of the oven.  The one closest to me was actually my pizza.  Almost 15 minutes later the young girl with the CM sweater on called me up to get my order.   When I told her that my pizza was ready 15 minutes ago, she said \"sorry about that \".   It's not really her fault of course. She was not properly trained and or coached. A much older, stern looking woman with the, \"I just got back from my island vacation tan\",was behind the counter and I assume this was her manager (actually less of a manager and more of a observer) She was pretty obvious of the situation  We are lucky to have many very good pizza options nearby so I'll be taking my business there going forward."}
{"text":"Hubby and I were in the area and stopped in here mostly because a coworker told me this is his all-time favorite pizza place. It looked closed from the outside but it was packed with families and birthday parties on a Sunday afternoon. The space is very large and open with booths and tables.   The menu is small, serving only pizza and salads. We found the price to be a bit higher than the norm: large plain was around $15. Their salads are $5 for small or $8 for a large. We opted for only the plain pie. So I was pretty impressed by the pizza as it was pretty distinct, unlike any other I've tried. It had a chunky tomato sauce with light cheese. There were bits of garlic that you could taste in some bites. It also had a very thin and crispy crust. The first piece you get will be crispy for each bite but the longer the pie sits there, the middle does start to get softer and less crispy. No big deal though.   I will agree with Serena T. that Harry's pizza is better eaten right away as it's not as good cold. When it's cold, the flavors you love when it's hot have seemed to disappear.   Overall, I really enjoyed the pizza and can definitely see myself stopping here when I'm in the area. Is it enough to make the long drive from Pittsburgh just for the pizza? I'm not sure, but it's definitely a one of a kind pie."}
{"text":"Serviceable pizza at best.  I think the glowing reviews raised my expectations.  It's not horrible but my palate didn't find anything above the bar here."}
{"text":"Best thin crust pizza in McMurray/Peters - expect more than a pizza joint. Good environment to sit down for dinner. Very friendly staff, plus, they give back to the community!"}
{"text":"Love Harry's. Been going here for around 10 years. The quality and taste of the pizza has been consistently great ever since. I am a big fan of the thin crust and amount of toppings that are put on. My standard order is pepperoni mushroom and it is made to perfection every time (knock on wood). They also have a house salad which is very good with the house dressing and mozzarella cheese. Harry's is the best place for pizza in Peters Township - where there is a good amount of competition."}
{"text":"Average pizza. Decent sauce, generic crust, small size, high priced. Okay in a pinch."}
{"text":"Delish but expensive. I thought the pizza was pretty great and reasonable, even. But the toppings were so expensive, it was ridiculous. I can understand paying $3.25 for toppings on a large pizza if they really piled em on but the toppings were really sparse. Still, good."}
{"text":"For a long time we didn't know we had such good pizza so close to home, mainly because Doug likes to make pizza from scratch. Harry's does Nepoletana thin crust pizza, and does it very well.  Because it's so simple, the key to this style of pizza is a great crust and really fresh, good quality ingredients, and Harry's has all that. The sauce is very simple, and the cheese they use is some of the best I've had. They know how to handle the ingredients here. Their house salad is delicious...mixed greens with gorgonzola, Greek olives, roasted red pepper and their own dressing, which is excellent. Seating is comfortable and service is good, so we often dine in rather than get take out. The room is large enough to accomodate big groups, and there's usually a kid's sports team celebrating post game here, or a birthday party going on. Harry's serves wine and beer."}
{"text":"Every single thing about Harry's Pizza is perfect. Their location, perfect. Their food and service, perfect. Oh, and they serve beer!! Which is quite alright in my book.   Personally, I love Harry's Pizza, and it's always a real treat when I get the chance to eat a piece of their perfected craft. Their pizza is definitely original and it seems like you could walk down a street and give some random guy an unknowingly bite of that thin, majestic Harry's pizza and he would instantly say \"Oh, that's Harry's pizza.\" And probably ask if he could have the rest of the slice; I know I would.  The only reason I'm giving Harry's a 4 and not a 5 (and it's really not that big of a deal to other people, but kinda is for me) has to do with the size of their bar.   Harry's has a tiny, too close for comfort if they're not family or friends - sized bar; which could and should be bigger and have more TV's. They could definitely get a better crowd if they added that element to their establishment. Just my opinion..  But, I do know that I will come to Harry's again and again for their pizza and relish every second of it."}
{"text":"Harry's is my go to for ordering a pizza when friends come over. It's well priced, and the crust and toppings are always on point. The crust is thin and crispy, the sauce is savory with a hint of sweet and the cheese is perfection.  I usually order out, but have dined in a couple of times. There isn't much to the atmosphere, but that's ok - the waitstaff is friendly and attentive and they also have a selection of beer and wine. Pizza and a house salad (delicious!) are the way to go. I've never been disappointed! If you are carrying out, call ahead. They always give you a wait time and the pizza is ready when you arrive. They also ring you up very quickly, and with a smile, to get you on your way.  Although Harry's appearance is nothing out of the ordinary, it most defiantly stands apart from other pizza franchises and is worth the trip!"}
{"text":"I have been eating at Harry's Pizza for probably about the last 8 or so years. I don't get to eat there a lot because it is a little bit of a hike from where I live. But anytime I am in the neighborhood I will definitely stop to get some pizza.  Always start with a salad. I would give their salad 5 stars. I could eat one everyday. Everything about it is delicious, spring mix lettuce with the right amount of toppings (croutons, roasted red peppers & Gorgonzola cheese) & delicious house dressing.  Their pizza is thin & crispy. It's a change of pace from the typical floppy greasy pizza you normally get from pizza shops. I always order onion & garlic toppings.  Service is always wonderful! Waitresses are always friendly.  If you are in the area definitely recommend eating @ Harry's."}
{"text":"LOVE their pizza and great service everytime I go! They have a home made balsamic for their salads that is awesome and the pizza is the best!"}
{"text":"I'd give it five stars, but as this is a New Haven-style pie, they missed the most important version of it - the white clam. Harry's version of the Pepe's classic has a sauce that seems to come from Olive Garden.  Every other pie is great though.  Best crust in town if you like 'em thin and crispy without breaking the bank like at Il Pizzaiolo or Piccolo Forno.  As it's the only New Haven style pie in the entire county it'll be different to most Pittsburghers, but most we've turned onto the place love it, despite the fact that they don't bury the pies under mounds of industrial mozz/provolone cheese blend like 99% of the pizza shops around here.  It's a ways out from the city, but worth it.  Clean too."}
{"text":"I live in Pittsburgh, about 40 minutes from Harry's Pizza.  I look for any and all reasons to be near Harry's Pizza.  All Pizza is different and many are good but Harry's is the perfect Pizza to me.  I visit often and have gotten to know the employees over the last few years.  It is a great atmosphere, sit anywhere you want, simple menu.... pretty much Pizza and Salad.  If you haven't already, you must try Harry's Pizza."}
{"text":"There's a big difference between \"thin and crispy\" and just burnt. The menu consists of nothing but pizza and one salad... I really would have liked an appetizer.  Not the worst pizza in the world, but definitely not the best. Probably won't be back, sorry!"}
{"text":"Harry's has a great atmosphere and the servers were kind and attentive.   The vegetarian pizza, while absolutely loaded with toppings, was lacking flavor - almost like a lack of seasoning on the toppings. There was also not nearly enough cheese. However the crust was absolutely perfect - thin and crispy but not overdone."}
{"text":"This is probably my favorite places for pizza in the South Hills.  There's just something about the ingredients that make it taste super good.  I feel like no one ingredient is overpowering such as the sauce, cheese, or dough - they all complement each other.    The only pizzas I've tried here are plain, pepperoni, and Hawaiian.  All have been tasty and I guess it depends on your mood what you might be hankerin' for.    Every time I've ordered from this place the pizza has been hot and crispy - it's not all soggy and you can tell it's been sitting in the \"holding\" area forever.    Usually I'm all about cold pizza the day after, but for some reason I can't get into that with Harry's Pizza.  Maybe it's b/c it's so good hot that I don't have time to bother with the sub-par taste of cold pizza from Harry's.    If you're in the area and craving some cheese, sauce, and dough - check it out!"}
{"text":"OMG I fell in love the first time I had lunch here.  The pizza (pepperoni/pineapple) was to die for.  Stacey is the best!  If you are in town and want pizza, stop by.  The atmosphere is fantastic also."}
{"text":"The hubby & I don't order pizza. There's just too much terrible pizza out there and we rarely find one worth going to. Harry's is the exception. The hubby likes the broccoli and chicken and I like mine with just cheese and both sides are awesome! The salads are amazing as well. We always order one. If you are in the area it's a must try!"}
{"text":"Harry's burnt Pizza....if you like black, dried out, tough to chew crust this is the place for you. Go to Fiori's you'll be glad you did"}
{"text":"Love their pizza. Never over cooked. Salads are amazing with their house balsamic and staff is so nice!"}
{"text":"Now, I don't know if it's just me, but this place feels way underrated! I always drive by Harry's and assume it's like an Italian Village Pizza or a Vochelli's - NOPE. Harry's Pizza has a bar, wine, and out of this world pizza!  I have only been here once, but the pizza has a special place in my heart. Their pizza is a thin crust and super cheesy! I got a white pizza with chicken and spinach. What I really liked about their pizza was that they don't overflow it with the toppings. I know, this sounds silly and why would that be ideal? Well, you don't loose grip of your pizza slice. You get to taste the crust, cheese, and toppings - rather than just the toppings. And it's just enough per slice! Trust me on this one.  Harry's is real fancy or upscale, but you can still order wine so who cares! There are so many pizza places around the area, but Harry's might be one of my top 3 now. I can't wait for my next trip back."}
{"text":"I like this place.  I like a lot of things about the food but it's a mixed bag for me.  I love the Harry's salad.  Why are there kalamata olives on the salad but you can't order them on your pizza?  Anyway, it's a salad for two but I could eat the whole thing.  I've had a dozen or so pizzas here.  They're a little bland for me.  The dough is a little under fermented for my taste but has good chew and when they bake it long enough it's pretty good.  I hate their mushrooms and it's my favorite ingredient.  I can't tell you what's up with them but I've moved on.  It's all just a little flat.  I've eaten at the New Haven classics and this just doesn't even come close to stacking up.  It's ok. I like to show up for lunch sometimes for the salad and personal sized pizza."}
{"text":"yum yum yum!! Thin crust, heavy flavor and generous toppings. The price is really good and seating indoor is actually nice. How have I not tried this place before? Def give it a shot if you're in the area."}
{"text":"Mini Pepperoni! One of my favorite things in this world  Whenever we try a new pizza place we have to go with a half pepperoni (for me) and the other half with pepperoni and sausage for my husband. We also like to try one of their appetizers, so here we went with the bread sticks. They also have a special pizza of the day at a sale price so ask about that.  The Bread sticks, not my favorite item. A little too blah, not the most flavor, and also pretty dry since the crust is so thin. It comes with 2 small containers of marinara sauce. This is more like a chunky tomato sauce than a marinara to me. Hardly any flavor, which I don't mind, but a true marinara lover may not be too happy about it. On to the pizza. We got a large, and that my friends in an understatement. It was HUGE!! It was also covered with toppings, YAY!!! I really despise places that chintz on toppings. If I'm paying for every topping I want my pizza covered from edge to edge and here they did not disappoint. Thin crust pizza topped with the same tomatoey sauce, cheese, and toppings. It was a very chewy crust. My jaw was starting to get sore after my second slice! The bottom was super crispy and not burned. Overall it was good. Not my favorite pizza, but not the worst by any means. I prefer a less seasoned sauce on my pizza so that was a plus for me. The service was good and they do offer a military discount."}
{"text":"Ok, so the first time we went to Harry's it was amaaazing!  So good!  The salad was fabulous (beautiful mixed greens with fresh mozzarella, roasted red peppers, kalamata olives, blue cheese and chunky croutons...definitely yum), and we thought \"Yes!  We finally found our new favorite pizza place!\"   The next few times were OK, and then this last was bad.  The pizza was tough and leathery, and if we hadn't had such a good time the previous visits we wouldn't go back again.  We'll give it one more try, so I'll update this again. So, salad is a hit.  Beer selection is OK.  I'd like to see more pizza combinations options instead of a la carte toppings...when you start adding things, it can get ridiculous, so it'd be good to have pre-set combos.  So, one more try Harry's, we really want to love you!"}
{"text":"Best pizza in pittsburgh and I am a pizza snob! Crispy crust, quality toppings, definitely our go to spot. We always get sausage and peppers and I always have to stop myself from eating half a pie on my own! Too many pizza places have doughy pizza with bad sauce but not Harrys! Good sauce, perfect cheese to topping ratio, all around great!"}
{"text":"I want you to imagine your best friend is a chef. Now imagine your friend invited you over for dinner and makes the best pizza and salad you have ever tasted. That's exactly what you get at Harry's. Not only do you get phenomenal food, but you get treated like you are the most important person there. I don't even care for salad, but I always make it a point to order some here. Don't even get me started on the pizza! Sometimes I just let them choose my toppings for me and I'm always blown away. One of the workers kneads the dough WITHOUT EVEN LOOKING AT IT (Ray Charles style)! 10/10 would eat here everyday if I had the time."}
{"text":"Harry's is one of my favorite pizza joints. My wife will say the same.  Their pizza is a thinner style, which I personally like. Don't forget to get a house salad with their house made dressing as well, because it's GREAT. I wish I could buy their house salad dressing, because it's that good.  The reason I can't give Harry's a full 5 star rating is because I think it's just a tad bit expensive - for pizza, that is. But hey, if you want good pizza, sometimes you gotta pay for it! I've never regretted going here. It's always good."}
{"text":"Love it. When I am away at school I miss Harry's! Everything is so fresh and flavorful. I've gotten so many of my friends to try Harry's and they all agree that it is the best! I don't like crusts that much so I love that this is thin and crispy!"}
{"text":"Stopped at Harry's last night. No issue with service however the pizza was mediocre at best. We ordered two pies and both had little sauce and the crust was a bit burned. I also found it to be expensive for what you got. I can't recommend this place as a specific dining destination, and if you are in the area there are better and less expensive options. Don't think we will be dining there again."}
{"text":"One of the best kept secrets in all of Pittsburgh. If you love Neapolitan-style thin crust pizza, this is the only place worth going, ever. We always order a large pepperoni and mushroom pizza and it's large enough to leave 3 people more than full. The slices are thin but plentiful and the bake on the pizza crust is always perfect. So perfect that the slice is crispy enough to support itself even when held by the crust. Their house salad is fresh every time and the dressing is amazing. I look forward to eating at Harry's weeks in advance and it's definitely worth the hour drive for me."}
{"text":"Fantastic pizza place!! We drive 45 minutes just to eat pizza here. It's amazing. The perfect thin crust pizza. Their house salad is also amazing. Last time I went we ordered a cheese pizza with onion and sausage. It comes out very quickly. They go a bit heavy on the garlic but I'm a big fan of garlic. Definitely give this place a try."}
{"text":"I love Harry's pizza. The salad is incredible, The pizza crust is the best around and Stacey the server is sweet, funny and accommodating. My favorite pizza place in the south hills!"}
{"text":"There pepperoni pizza is not my favorite (smaller pepperoni slices that curl up and often get burnt), but their plain pizza was very good. They have a large, modern dinning room that will accommodate large parties quite nicely."}
{"text":"Harry's is one of my go-tos for pizza. I like the pizza and I love their salads.  But not tonight....The counter staff is inept and no one seems to care. If I call for an order and I'm told 20-25 minutes, I shouldn't be told it will be TWENTY more minutes when I walk in twenty minutes later.  \"Sorry I don't know what's going on\" isn't exactly good customer service.  No one who gives a shit is working, that's for sure. Really disappointing."}
{"text":"By far one of my favorites in the area.  It's thin, crunchy and awesome.  Love the hot sausage and mushroom. Also the shrimp pizza is delicious.  Lunch special is pizza, salad and a drink. Can't be beat."}
{"text":"I love Harry's. But all I have ever gotten here is the pepperoni pizza, which is crisp and loaded with yummy, slightly crisp pepperoni slices, and the bottom with lovely charred places that shows it has been in a brick oven. I no longer eat pork products, so I have not been here and ordered another topping, but if you like a pizza done this way, Harry's is for you.  On the expensive side, but you get what you pay for."}
{"text":"We dined in at Harry's because my friends dad said it was the spot.  The inside is nice, pretty clean and simple with the only real decor being some cute paintings of food on the wall that appeared to be original and not just mass produced crap.  Our waitress was very friendly and the service was solid.  The menu consists of absolutely nothing but pizza and salad, which is annoying.  The pizza isn't so artisanal or anything that it would justify being the only thing on the menu.   We got a large (18 inch) cheese pizza with no cheese on one half, which is how I like to judge pizzas.  The pizza is being made fresh by hand and cooked directly on the brick of a deck style pizza oven.  On this particular night the pizzaman must have gotten pretty busy or lazy because the bottom of the oven was really dirty to the point that the pizza had several little pieces of black charred remains of food from previous pies stuck to the bottom of it.  The pizza crust is paper thin, a good bit too thin.  So thin that the whole middle of the pie drops down and falls apart and is somewhat inedible at points.  Here are my instructions for eating this pizza (seriously, i'm not joking the results will really be pretty good if you don't mind wasting the dough).    Step 1: Put a paper plate on the of the middle of the pizza    Step 2: Cut the pizza in a circle around the paper plate as if to cut out a mini-pizza from the middle    Step 3: Take that useless middle \"mini-pizza\" and get rid of it (trash it, feed it to a deer, mail it to an old flame,    whatever works)    Step 4: Enjoy your new crispy giant pizza donut sans flop-fest  The dough itself taste alright, a bit on the salty crackery side though and lacking any real yeasty flavor.  The texture is pretty nice and a bit bready and on the spots where it is thick enough it does have a very nice crunch to it.    The sauce was really simple, I think it may just be straight crushed tomatoes with no water or paste.  Not the best tomatoes but not the worst either.  The sauce has a perfect medium thickness and they use a LOT of it, which usually I would be excited for but the crust being so thin doesn't exactly hold up to the heavy sauce.  They are using fresh garlic in the sauce and going a little bit overboard with it.  Instead of mixing herbs into the sauce they are spreading the herbs on each pie individually as they go, which has a nice aesthetic affect but it doesn't make for a very consistent taste.  They are going a bit too heavy on the herbs as well, if they toned back the garlic and herbs it would benefit the pie a lot.  The sauce was very well distributed across the whole pie although brimming over the edges at a few points.  They go lite on the cheese and they use a high quality cheese.  The cheese was distributed perfectly across the pie and it was pretty much the perfect amount of cheese also.  The pie was cooked perfectly with a nice medium dark bottom and nice melted cheese on the darker side but not at all dry.   In general the pizza is just too thin.  If it were not so thin than the flavors in the sauce maybe wouldn't be so overpowering.  Its still a pretty decent pie and is worth trying, they definitely take a lot of pride in what they do.  I would imagine that they are probably pretty consistent too, based on how well made our pie was on the first go-round.    On the funky scale from 1 to 10 I am giving this pizza a respectable Aquaboogie 6."}
{"text":"Stopped in for lunch after shopping at Tanger. Heard good things about this place so I had to try it out. The pizza was delicious. Crispy crust and fresh toppings. Service was good and quick. Give it a try."}
{"text":"Mum was raving about this place so I figured I'd check it out. We went over and the special was jalapeno, ricotta and pepperoni - three of my favorite things! We waited only 10 minutes on a table (Tuesday night) and I got a Pilsner Light. The waitresses (2 helped us) rocked. Very cool and had great info and totally cared about us and our feelings.   I got the special and my mum had red pepper & artichoke. The pie took awhile to get cooked but when you have good pie in a packed joint (ambiance was pseudo-Italian and cool), it does take some time.   The fresh basil was AWESOME. The jalapenos were diced which worked for me but was new to my tastes, but my only issue was the sauce. I don't like tomatoe chunks and it was full of them. Terribly full! We thought they were red peppers first.    Fortunately, they were large enough to pick off for me. My parents both like this place and I'd go back... Great service and nice people. I also want them to make me a white pizza :)"}
