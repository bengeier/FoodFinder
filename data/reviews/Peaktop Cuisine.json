{"text":"Dropping by here before vaugh mills on a family day weekend.  This place is quite empty consider it's a Sunday.  We ordered half a duck, which is on par with their store in fmp but temperature is a little cold.  Then come the big disappointment of preserved meat claypot rice.  For my whole life this dish has two kinds of yummy sausages and preserved meat to the least.  Now this place only have one kinds of sausages and 2 pieces of preserved meat.  And when I asked the waiting he tried to be nice but it is their company policy!! Wtf!!!!'  The other dishes are average at most.  This place want to cater to a more sophisticated clientele with better service and decor, with a price we pay.  But food is just average and really not a great lunch experience.  My usual spot is the pho place across which is one of my favourite.  Needless to say i am done with this place."}
{"text":"I went there recently on 2 separate occasions, once for dinner and another time for dim sum.   I would give 4 stars for dinner: the food was okay, nothing amazing but it was decent, the service was really fast and the charges were fair.  Now for dim sum, it barely gets 1 star. The food was awful, the dough fritters swam in oil - I still feel sick from the two bites I took - and the rest of the platters were mediocre, you can definitely get better food at lower prices elsewhere. The service was quite slow considering there were only 4 tables occupied.  They charged for tea per person - I always say, if a Chinese restaurant charges for basic tea which barely costs them 2 cents in costs, then it's not a great place to eat...    Overall, dim sum was a bad experience and I certainly won't be back again."}
{"text":"Better off with main menu stir-fried dishes like \"lotus roots ??\", you won't find fine din-sum here but at least they have something for everyone. Stone pot rice with cured meat (??????was real good. Roasted pigeon (???? had really crispy skin. Pricy but it's normal for seafood Chinese house. ??????, but they have the delicacies like shark fins and such"}
{"text":"Come here on a weekday at 7:30pm.  Oops what happens we are the only table in the restaurant.  Half an hour later, there is another table.  There are only 2 tables throughout the whole night.  It is not comparable to the same restaurant in First Markham Place.  The taste of the dishes is average.  We ordered chicken, beef, pork, vegetables and seafood.  The only thing I recall is the scallop not fresh.  It turns pinky in colour and tastes awful.  We are not going back!"}
{"text":"Came here for dimsum with the fam for family day. Had a reservation for 1pm but we weren't seated until 1:10. Fine. It was SUPER busy, I get it.   Once we were seated we were brought tea and water almost immediately. Not bad.   Filled out our order and hand it to our server. At this point another family came in and was seated next to us. Tell me how they managed to get their order and were almost done eating before we finally started getting ours?? My cousin didn't even get to have a bite before she had to leave for work at 2. Literally sat there for an hour drinking tea.   The food was meh, and everything from the soup spoons, to plates and tea cups were dirty af. I'm talking grab for the spoon to find a dirty ass rolled up sticker underneath it (now I wish I took pictures). Any time you ask for hot sauce, soy sauce, or mustard they would literally bring you one and you'd have to run them back for more (like hello, just bring me the squeeze bottle or at least enough for a table of 8 holy fk you have no idea how much time you're wasting running back and forth).   It was upsetting, the food was not enough to make up for the service. At all. They don't have the deep fried taro balls (damn), and they ruined the deep fried crab balls by rolling them in almond slices before frying them (just why?? They were not crispy and they tasted like burnt almonds...). Thankfully they did not mess up the har gow or siu mai or fong gao but I'd be damned if I came here again just for that.   It's too bad because I wanted to give them the benefit of the doubt and some of the servers were nice but overall it was a shitty time.  Never again."}
{"text":"I came here for dimsum as it was the closest Chinese place to my home. The food was pretty good until our last dish came out, the fried chives and shrimp dumpling. It tasted like when you are steaming water snails and the pot of water rain out without you knowing so it starts to burn. I was actually looking forward to that dish as my brother really loves it at another place, so I was gonna give it a try here yet it was a major disappointment."}
{"text":"Tough crowd. I go here all the time for dim sum because it's convenient. It's a little more expensive than legit dim sum places, but it;s consistently quite good.  I think you can get dim sum all day but they stop making the rice noodle rolls after 4pm.  Oh and I think Mondays and/or Tuesdays they have a special for Peking Duck that's a really good deal and they do it quite well.  Service is always top notch - they treat me so good here! I recommend checking them out!"}
{"text":"Wanted some dim sum real bad and this place was the closest dim sum to my house. It wasn't too bad, surprisingly and for the price, it's quite good.  My friend and I ordered the staple dim sum items (har gow, siu mai, rice noodle rolls, etc..) and I can't complain, they were yummy (minus the fried squid, which was just alright).  I didn't get a chance to try the Chinese dishes, but if I were to get Chinese food I'd probably travel a little farther to Richmond Hill/ Markham to be honest..   All in all, Peaktop satisfied my cravings."}
{"text":"Had dinner here after wonderland and the Chinese food is a cut above the norm. Service is very good with fast and freshly made food with great ingredients. No desert such as tofu or red bean soup.  Red jello shaped in red hearts was offered instead which was good for the seven and six year old with us."}
{"text":"3255 Rutherford is right in between from Wonderland and Vaughan mills. Where Dollarama and sleep country is. Turn south at Sweetriver Boulevard towards the plaza and right again. Peaktop will be on your left.  Service 3/10: They seem to be understaffed as there were 6 empty tables and could not seat a group of 3 for almost 10 minutes. Tea was not asked and this not served the moment we sat down. Overall felt slow. Food 7/10: Quality is good. Taste is under-average. Presentation of dimsum is very good. Atmosphere 9/10: Very comfortable home feeling. Rather quiet but staff is friendly.  Price 6/10: Comparatively more expensive than ones in Markham or Scarborough by about 15%. Overall weighted score 7.3/10: Definitely worth checking out"}
{"text":"Odd location for a dim sum resto of this calibre. It's located in a strip mall and is very unassuming. The decor inside was unexpected. It reminded me of the better Dim Sum joints in Markham. However by comparison the food was just decent. I especially liked that it was clean and the service seemed to be on point."}
{"text":"On first glance Peak Top looks like a nice high end restaurant but soon I noticed that the restaurant seems to have a cleanliness issue from the floor to the walls (like, why the walls?) to the windows and chair coverings.  We were at the restaurant for dim sum. The food is just ok. They took some short cuts on some of the classic dim sum foods.  The entertaining factor were the staff. There was a good server, but the hostess shuffles around chewing on something. At one point, she had so much food in her mouth she could not greet incoming guests defaulting to hand gestures.  And there is this guy, an older gentleman, looking extremely scruffy in his Chinese outfit, dirty and not buttoned up, and just shuffling around and staring at people eating. Every now and then he would circle the receipt for food received. Then he goes on his merry way humming and cleaning his ears with his fingers, chewing on something.  Peak Top restaurant is a great example of lots of money spent on building the place but non spend on getting quality staff."}
{"text":"Really great food and great service, very  comparable to szuechan szuechan except not as expensive. Will visit again."}
{"text":"Reserved for 1. Didn't get table til 1:15. Ordered food, did not get it until an hour later. Horrible service, horrible food."}
{"text":"Steamed fish and the lobster dish are excellent here. A bit pricey, but the quality is great."}
{"text":"I come here as I am always around the Vaughan area and I always come to eat here...food is a hit or miss and the service is bad depending on which server u get and they are tight with the hot sauce...but I come here cause it's close"}
{"text":"Come for the excellent decor, stay for the average-quality Dim Sum.  High-back, plush sofa chairs, linen tablecloth, and gold-embossed chopsticks make dining here an elevated experience of elegant Chinese Dining! Even the washrooms were clean and nicely decorated. But the Dim Sum was average quality without a memorable taste; 6 items for the two of us + 15% tip came up to $32.  We'd come back, but it's a long drive from Scarborough, so only on occasion..."}
{"text":"This restaurant is the closest Cantonese cuisine to my house. I don't come here often as I would rather drive 20mins to Richmond Hill for Cantonese cuisine but we were in the area and my bf was starving.   We ordered rice noodles in scrambled egg sauce, sizzling chicken with mushroom, and beef cheung fun. The food came out fairly quick and it tasted good. Everything had a perfect amount of seasoning so it wasn't too salty or that a spice was overpowering. Unfortunately while eating, I was very thirsty and kept drinking tea. Typically I barely finish a small cup of tea while dining, but at this place, I refilled my cup at least 5 times. My bf even asked me if I was okay and why am I drinking so much tea lol.   I don't know if I'll dine here again as the food made me really thirsty. Maybe I'll give it another shot in a couple months."}
{"text":"Price: around 10-$15/person Service: 4/5 Food: 4/5 overall value: 3/5  I am giving this place 3/5 because of the price, but everything else was great.  My girlfriend and I had dim sum (the regular stuff - rice noodle, har-gow, siu mai, bbq pork buns, etc.)  Likes: they give you 5 har-gow, their bbq pork was nice and juicy with a dark red colour, the booths (rare for dim sum) and service was okay.    Dislike: Roast duck with rice (it was all bones)  All in all, if I'm at Vaughan Mills or in Wonderland, I'd go again."}
{"text":"Used to be one of the few Chinese restaurants in Vaughan. Their bbq items (cha siu, roast duck)  are not bad and I never had any problems. But my husband ordered the black bean beef rice noodle last time and got food poisoning from it, he was throwing up all night. Because of that horrifying experience, we will never come back. You can tell the restaurant has seen better days... now it just looks rundown, and there were barely anyone there when we went."}
{"text":"I came here for a dinner and hoped for the usual Chinese food fix.    However,  the food came out extremely salty. Service on the slower side and servers don't smile much.   I ordered sweet and sour pork, soft shell crab, beef ho fun,  snow pea leaves. All dishes were average and nothing spectacular.    The decor is nice and that are very clean."}
{"text":"This Peak Top location WOWed us when it first opened near Vaughan Mills. Having been to the one in Markham, what surprised us most is that this location's DECOR was upscaled as though you think that the Markham spot isn't a sister location.   Stepping inside it gives off an air of sophistication as you can see the perfect image of East meets West melt together with just enough CONTRAST to still know you're in a Chinese restaurant.   On one side of the restaurant there's booths arrangements that make it comfortable for a small FAMILY to chat between themselves in a Modern setting while the other side barely noticeable separated is the Traditional Chinese where you can engage larger groups as well as the Banquets.   First of all it's almost NONEXISTENT to see Chinese Dim Sum restos in these parts of the woods. Secondly, to have such an ELEGANT place that makes you feel going back to DT or Scarb for Dim Sum is pretty ghetto.   Obviously class comes with a price tag and you will notice it as you won't see Dim Sum Specials here. It is Lunch Rush pricing throughout the day. It might cost a bit more but there's definitely VALUE to it as the food always comes out looking GREAT.   The menu is nice too as it resembles a LARGE place mat that gives you a nice photo of the item along with the name. This is not a Pushcart place so you might have to check for missing items with the Wait Staff from time-to-time.   In terms of Wait Staff, we do not know if they purposely forget or not but sometimes our condiment request never shows until our 5th attempt.   There's an EEL Pastry that I've tried and it's a unique flavour combination that I like one day and not like next day. The Bean Curd Wrap has a good sauce on top. No complains about the Shrimp Dumplings and Sui Mai but the Lotus Sticky Rice tends to be on the small-serving side as they wrap it in elongated shape.   Anyways, I'm stuck in these parts of the woods and I'm HAPPY this place exists."}
{"text":"Went here for a Saturday night dinner with the family, the waiter was attentive but wasn't sure if he was being overly sarcastic he just kept saying it was up to us and provided no opinion whatsoever.    We started with pei king duck it was ok not as crispy as I wouldn't have liked but the sauce made it taste good.    We had the lobster with the ginger and garlic and it was also good, but I have had it at other places and this one wasn't flavourful as the others that I have tried.  The hot and sour soup and the rice noodles were also ok at best.  For the prices that they charge you would expect better quality food, but overall the experience was subpar."}
{"text":"I come here pretty regularly, probably once every few months for the last 4 years. It's not the best dim sum but it is the best one in Vaughan so it's my go-to spot when for when I don't feel like trekking all the way to Markham. My usual order is:  - har gow  - sui mai - chicken feet - tripe - soft shell crab  - deep fried shrimp rolls  - shrimp rice rolls - turnip cake - roasted pork/jellyfish platter   The above listed items are usually pretty consistent in terms of quality and taste. I've also ordered pretty extensively from the menu and have had some disappointments such as the spicy noodles (tasted like really bland/oily instant noodles). The items are on the pricier side so our bill between 2 people is usually around $40. My reasoning is that I pay for the convenience of the location - it's only 15 minutes from my neighbourhood vs. Markaham which can be 30-40 minutes PLUS I always have to wait for a table. I would not say this is a place to go for when you are craving quality dim sum but if you live closeby and have a raging hangover that requires a greasy breakfast, then Peak Top is a sure bet!  Parking can easily be found in the plaza parking lot. Service is not the best but let's be honest, service at these types of places is never the best so be prepared. They will provide you with everything you ask for (ie. ice water, hot sauce etc) but they may not do it with a huge smile on their face so don't be offended."}
{"text":"The only quality Chinese restaurant in Vaughan.  In a wasteland of Italian restaurants, Asian is nearly impossible to find.  I finally had an opportunity to try this establishment right after Labor Day.  It was heaven, even if I was a bit desperate.  It is not quite up to the level of the Ambassador in Richmond Hill, but it saved me from hating Italian cuisine by offering me an excellent alternative.  I plan on having lunch there at least once per week during the cold months-the draw?-shrimp wonton noodle soup, a great soul-warming meal for an insanely cheap $4.95.  Of course the real lunchtime feast will be the dim sum.  2 hearty eaters hurt themselves for 20 bucks apiece!"}
{"text":"One of my favourite Chinese restaurants in Vaughan. Their foods are pretty fresh. Although dishes are typically a little bit higher in price then most Chinese restaurant. Quantity is inconsistent. Especially in the $16 vegetable dishes, they give you such a small amount compared to other restaurants. I dont see a point of being cheap when it comes to vegetables. Dim sum is okay, wish they had more options. Service is also pretty decent for a Chinese restaurant. Waiters and waitresses are often walking around the restaurant to assist customers. The only waiter that really bothers me personally is the tall chubby chinese guy. He works usually Fri-Sun. His service is terrible, he often comes to my table to mock me and my family in vietnamese and is really damn annoying and impatient. He sits there right in front of us every time to wait for us to order and rushes us."}
{"text":"Best roasted duck I've tasted!! This is my favorite place to have duck, we usually call ahead to make sure they reserve one. I would have given 5 stars but I didn't like the portion size for the price and lacked options. They suggested king mushrooms and didn't tell us up-charge of $4. Regardless, this is still one of my favorite Chinese places to eat in Vaughan"}
{"text":"I purely go here for the convenience. But upon my many visits I've ordered a variety of dishes that are quite yummy.   Yes the har gow is presented pretty but it isn't as good as other places. I stopped ordering this here. But the bitter melon, rice noodle rolls, softshell crab, siu mai, anything deep fried and the jelly fish meat dish is all good.   I also really like their cold hong Kong milk tea :)  This place grows on you and I normally gather all my friends here. It isn't THE BEST but if I'm looking for something close to home this is my goto dimsum place."}
{"text":"I like going here a lot with my family for dinner because it's affordable for what you are eating. There is a huge variety of Chinese cuisine you can choose from. They serve Peking duck, lobster, crab, sizzling plates etc. They make my favourite Cantonese chow mein very well.  The restaurant itself is very clean and well put together.  The servers are nice but it can get a pretty hectic when it's get busy. Don't be afraid to call them over, instead of sitting and waiting for them to pass by. They are also open during certain holidays whereas most restaurants would close.  It gets busy for lunch since it's time for Dim Sum. They don't have an extensive menu for Dim Sum but they have the popular ones like Har Gow and Shaomai. They also offer a set lunch deal. They don't push carts around with food so you don't have to search and wait for the food you want to come. There's a paper they give that you can write how many of which you want.  You can also order take out, or order a party tray here."}
{"text":"This restaurant is more of a quick fix for people in the area who doesn't want to travel far for dim sum. It is quite pricey for average quality food but it will do. I don't mind it and I usually do come here at least once a month. However, during the holidays I went with a family total of 7 people. We were asked if we would like some water or hot tea so we got both. Out came a pot if tea and 6 waters, we also ordered pop on the side. When the bill came we noticed a charge for $8 for water or tea? I asked the waiter and he said yes all restaurants charge now. Ok? But 1st of all there's only 7 of us. 2nd, it doesn't make sense because we also ordered drinks. 3rd, how can you charge for tap water? I understand restaurants are charging for tea but per person? What if I came with 15 kids and only I want tea? Will they charge me $16? I told them it was ridiculous and should be charged by pot. Also, we did not see anywhere that states they will charge for tea or water. Their explanation and reasoning did not make sense either. All I can do is let everyone know of such charge and never return.   Overall, Food 3/5 Service 1/5 (really slow)"}
{"text":"I really wish there were more Chinese restaurants within the vicinity. We keep coming here due to convenience, not for quality of food. The service is really mediocre. What really annoys me is that they charge for tea. Really? If you're at a table with 2 adults they charge for 2 teas even if only ONE person is drinking it. So if you're planning on drinking tea solo, do you notify the staff that it should be tea for one?? Or do they sneak it onto the bill hoping you won't notice? Well, maybe I should deduct the tea charge off their tip, perhaps that will deter them from charging for some hot water & a sprinkle of super cheap tea leaves. Trust me, a pot of tea wouldn't even set them back a penny. If anyone can suggest a better place for dim sum that's not too far from here please let me know fellow Yelpers!"}
{"text":"The food taste good but I'm concern the quality of the food. Over the last few months me and my friend went there few times. 1. Take out. I had bad diarreah and my friend was ok. 2. Eat-in last month. My friend had a very bad headache after the meal. 3. Take out (just myself). I had the worst diarreah of my life within 1 hour eating the food.   The food taste good but I will not go there any more....."}
{"text":"This is a regular place for me and every chance I get to dine here for breakfast (dim sum) I won't hesitate to go. Keep in mind that this place is not close to me either. I've eaten many things here but my favourite dish is the almond covered shrimp balls..delish! The quality of the food is great very authentic. The servers don't even speak English so it gets kind of hard asking for extra soya sauce or hot sauce to eat with your food. Which I need all the time at every Chinese restaurant I go too. :) I would definitely recommend this place and am looking forward to going back."}
{"text":"Worst dimsum i've had the misfortune of eating.  Sure i've had bad dimsum before, but prices were significantly cheaper. Taking into account quality and quantity, this place claims top spot for worst  We ordered fried shrimp balls covered in almond slices. Out came 4 sad looking balls that looked like refried leftovers. Tasted as bad as they looked. I was certain that if i threw one at the wall that rubbery thing would dent the wall!  Next came 4 more balls they listed as beef balls. You wouldn't know from the taste. They might as well rename it to mysterious brown dough.   The rest were just as bad that i dont even feel the need to go on listing every single item.   Ugh!"}
{"text":"The food is actually disgusting and the waiter was incredibly rude. Didn't get served or seated until we asked... the beef literally tasted like rubber."}
{"text":"Very expensive and they give you small portions.  And the taste is very mediocre.  The only reason to come here is because you require Chinese food and your in the Vaughan Mills area"}
{"text":"Peak Top is a fancy no-plastic-tablecloths type of Chinese restaurant.    We decided to check it out for dim sum due to it's proximity to the 400N for out of town family that had to hit the road afterwards.  Arriving around 10:30am on a Saturday, it was very quiet.  There was only one other occupied table.  It started to get busier around 11:30am.  The dim sum is served check-list style which I prefer anyway as the food usually arrives hotter and fresher.  Once we chose our items, it wasn't a long wait before food arrived.  The quality of dim sum was very good, not too greasy, and fresh tasting.    Service was friendly although the waitress did spill soya sauce on our table, splashing dangerously close to my my head and did not appologize.  If this was Hong Kong and I was with my relatives, this woman would have had been cussed out and torn a new one.  But as polite North Americans, we only tisked after she walked away.  We ordered 13 items (a variety of S-M-L) and the bill came out to $60 with tax and tip.  They also charge $0.60 per person for tea.  Not a bad option for dim sum, and the proximity to the highway and Vaughan Mills Mall is a bonus."}
{"text":"I don't feel particularly strongly either way about this place so I guess that earns it an automatic 3 stars. The food is decent, portion sizes fair and everything comes out pretty quickly (although this is generally the norm when it comes to dim sum.) Best dish was the ha cao and worst would have to be the rice rolls in xo sauce, they tasted doughy and overcooked. I would return here as the location is convenient for me and the food isn't bad but I'm sure there's better out there."}
{"text":"We were excited to find a dim sum restaurant in the area. However, we were quite disappointed with the food, price, and service. Upon entering, we were not greeted by anyone. Granted it was early on Saturday morning, and there were no other diners. However, the host kept looking at us from afar and it took a few minutes for him to come to the front to seat us. The food was not as good as we had hoped. We've been to a number of other dim sum restaurants and were not impressed by the quality of food for the price. Don't bother coming to Peak Top and go to Richmond Hill or Markham instead. We're not coming back here, given better options elsewhere."}
{"text":"My fiancee and I popped in for dim sum here on a Saturday because we had a hard time deciding where to eat and wanted to try something new. We got the deep fried octopus, fried turnip cake, Shanghai style dumplings, short ribs with black pepper sauce and a small bowl of scallop congee. The octopus was the only dish I actually liked, the turnip was mushy and undercooked, the dumplings were disappointing but edible, the congee was super plain and the short ribs which are usually my favorite thing were straight up gross. To top it off, this place charged us for water, which I'm pretty sure is against the law.   At the end of the day we paid more than $40 for two people which is already too much for dim sum for two, but it was also pretty much the worst dim sum I've ever had. Would never come back here, especially with so much great food in the neighborhood."}
{"text":"Absolutely can always count on shit service here. Horrible attitude. Only reason I go here is because it is  the only dim sum place in Vaughan. The price is expensive compared to dim sum in markham, sauga and Toronto. Food is decent. The grumpy old male waiters here are absolutely horrendous and are especially rude to females. Probably sexist. I cant wait until there is another dim sum in the area to shut this restaurant down. Not sure what their managers are doing but training staff is not one of them."}
{"text":"Update: it's been awhile since I have returned here. Service is a little bit better. Food is still the same just more expensive. Peking duck was good today but the congee was not. It was mediocre at best. Once again we are here for convenience. Just didn't feel like driving to Markham in the snow for Chinese food.     Overpriced and mediocre food. Hit and miss service.  We went there for dim sum on thanksgiving Monday. Knowing that it was a holiday and were prepared to wait for a table. Upon letting the gentlemen know that we were a table of 6. He asked if we had reservations and as I said no he scoffed and chuckled at me and turned away. How rude and weird at the same time.  We ordered peking duck $45 for two courses of wraps among other dim sum dishes. Although food cam out piping hot, tastes was just ok. Doesn't justify the high prices. There are other much better dim sum restaurant only problem they r not in Vaughan."}
{"text":"It wasn't too bad. I came in here with my brother after a wedding to fill our bellies with some Chinese food and it was one of the few places open. I ended up getting a bowl of won ton soup and it was quite tasty, piping hot, and came quickly. It probably helped that we were the only ones there."}
