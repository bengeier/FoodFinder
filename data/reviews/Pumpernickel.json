{"text":"I had a hankering for a pumpernickel bagel with cream cheese, so I thought \"what better place than a place *called* Pumpernickel's, right?\"    WRONG.  That was quite possibly the worst, most dry, most plain pumpernickel bagel I've ever had.  To top it off, they spread maybe 1 teaspoon of cream cheese on the bagel, leaving it tasteless, dry, and plain.  I've never seen anyone spread cream cheese so thin.  Especially on a bagel that cost $3.68.  In fact, it was so bad that I opened it up to see if I could just eat one half of the bagel, and upon doing so, found remnants of lettuce and other sandwich makings in the cream cheese.  Gross.  The staff were a bit abrasive, and the woman at the cash ignored me for a solid minute or two while she arranged things behind the counter (note that this is at 1:30 pm and during the lunch rush).  I will NOT be eating there again.  Thanks for nothing Pumpernickel's."}
{"text":"I think the food selection and flavor is very good for the few items I've had here.   **Unfortunately most (not all) of the staff is terrible! **  I was waiting to order - I'm the only person in line at the moment. 2 older ladies had a conversation with their backs to me. A third lady came out of the back, I ordered with her.  The cashier (the worst of the bunch), punched in the wrong item - a higher priced item. I told her that it was wrong. She moved her hand to the front of the cash register and tapped on the price a few times. I told her again it was the wrong item. The lady that took my order saw this and then told the cashier it was the wrong item - only after this did she punch in the correct item.  I paid by credit card. I told her I needed the credit card receipt. She was too busy talking to another staff member, and thus she crumpled up the receipt and was about to throw it away. I told her again I needed the receipt - she gave me the crumpled piece of paper as she continued to chat.  The guy behind me ordered something that required being in a plastic bowl (salad?) While a lady was making/preparing this item, her co-worker made a joke. The lady making this dude's lunch then tapped her co-worker on the head with this guys lunch bowl (the food was in the bowl!) while they both laughed.  Never going back."}
