{"text":"Taco Bell is better than this place. 45 minutes for a take out order that tasted poorly made. The place was empty. The servers were rude and unorganized and the food was extremely over priced. $15 for a burrito that was soggy the meat was dry and about half the size of a chipotle burrito. I'm surprised anyone goes there."}
{"text":"We went here on Cinco de Mayo, expecting slow service because of the holiday, but still went because of the specials. We both ordered margaritas; one frozen (which came out unfrozen) and one on the rocks, which contained no alcohol what so ever.   We both ordered the combination platter. The chicken in our burritos, etc. seemed as though it came out of a can. It was topped with shredded, microwave-melted cheddar cheese.   Overall the food had little to no flavor, and extremely small portions for the price.   Finally, they overcharged our bill. Luckily we caught it and they fixed the error (after a 10 minute wait)."}
{"text":"Food was average, the food wasn't served how it was ordered... a couple, a party of 6, and us were the only ones there, the service was below average and the restrooms were atrocious,  we sat outside and it was if they forgot about us, I got city tacos and she got garden burrito,  both were good but not complete, we didn't complain, short on napkins, we tipped the minimum.   Highly doubt we will return.  Peach margaritas were sufficient.   Below average overall."}
{"text":"This clean and new-looking establishment has all the classic kitch of a trusty Mexican restaurant, PLUS a cardboard cutout of the Dos Equis guy -- just in case you were worried it wasn't LEGIT.   It was completely empty when we walked in, but I'm guessing it's because people don't realize it has opened (it seems to have replaced another Mexican restaurant, rather recently, if you trust my GPS).   It's not strictly classic Mexican food, I don't think...some surprising (and surprisingly delicious) options included a spinach enchilada and a garden quesadilla with zucchini (seriously, so good). The vegetables in the quesadilla were just perfectly cooked (not too much so...and that's one of my pet peeves so I always notice!).  My mom had the spinach enchilada which I tried and liked also.   They actually have a whole separate vegetarian menu, which I was really impressed by -- I wanted to try it all.   OH and you must be warned -- the chips are REALLY good. They make them fresh in-house and wow, I almost ate so many I couldn't have my main dish.   Next time I find myself in North Royalton (and when it's not almost 100 degrees out), I'd like to try their festive-looking outdoor patio area. It was very cute and although no one was there at the time, I could tell it would be a fun nighttime spot as well."}
{"text":"First visit and pleasantly surprised. Great margaritas,  both mango and traditional.  Combo fajita with steak and shrimp was very good.  Vegetables were crisp,  shrimp just enough spice and steak was tender.  Will definitely return."}
{"text":"Service is absolutely horrible.  3 table tops in restaurant and the back bar is packed.  No one in the back bar can get a drink.  One server.  One bartender.  Will never patron here again just based on poor service alone."}
{"text":"I have never had anything bad here and I always leave with a full belly. The margaritas are amazing and so is the homemade salsa. I love that they have a minimal menu items so I am not spending all day narrowing down my order. Ruth is so nice and always greets her customers. They have a dinner special every day and it is always worth it! I like this place a lot better then chain Mexican restaurants. They quality of the food is authentic and fresh! I recommend to anyone in the area."}
{"text":"I moved from Medina to North Royalton recently. Me and my husband were looking for a Mexican restaurant around the new area. We used to (and will now make the drive) go to Don Tequila's in Medina and needed a \"replacement\" place closer to our new home. After experiencing Viva! the drive to Medina will be worth it. First off, we walk in on a Friday night and there are literally 2-3 tables filled. It took about 15 for us to even get our food ordered after we waited for drinks chips/salsa. Let me tell you about the salsa. Most Mexican restaurants do not charge you for this, but Viva! charges for extra or refills on salsa. Maybe Don Tequila's just spoiled me, but all other Mexican restaurants I've gone to does not charge you. With the place being so dead, we still waited around 45 minutes to get our food, which was pretty good, but also a little too overpriced. Lastly, when we got our bill, the prices were different than what was on the menu. When we asked (and after 15 minutes of our waiter investigating), the conclusion was there was a price difference because I asked for extra sour cream. I don't know mind paying a buck for extra sour cream, but when I asked for more she should've told us it was extra. It even would've been okay if it was a separate line item on our bill - but it was not. It also took another 10 minutes or so to actually pay our bill.  Long story short, it's okay...just overpriced and very VERY slow service. I can only imagine how slow it is when they are busy.  P.S. Go to Don Tequila's - great service, great food and great prices."}
