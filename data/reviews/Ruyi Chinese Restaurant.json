{"text":"We stopped in around 8:00 p.m. and had the restaurant to ourselves.  The couple there were very nice and friendly, and yes the service was good.  We had Szechuan shrimp, salted squid and mushroom/vegetable crispy noodle.  The shrimp was not large but the sauce was really good.  The squid was deep fried with garlic/ veggy.  Again very tasty.  I really liked the noodle.  The seasoning was light and not salty at all.  We will go back again."}
{"text":"I usually have rice with curry chicken with for lunch here for $4.50( they have 4 other lunch special for $4.40) . it's a huge plate of curried chicken and green pepper on rice.  This evening  I tried the BBQ pork fried rice and cashewnut chicken and I loved it. The fried rice was good texture with lots of egg with diced BBQ pork. Cashewnut chicken lots of chicken mixed with snow peas, green pepper, celery, carrots, mushrooms. And the sauce was to die for.  The place is not usually crowded with people. It is run by a very nice couple. Good value for money. Range of fried rice are about $5-7. Meat Dishes average around $8. Soups are around $5. Fried noodles between $5 and $6.  They don't do delivery I think. Definitely worth a drop by when you are in the hood."}
{"text":"Ordered Kung Pao Chicken. Got some inedible organs and whatnot.  It looked and tasted horrible. Could not eat it and I will never come back.   The Vietnamese place (168 something?) across the street is somewhat decent. Go there instead."}
{"text":"Don't be fooled by the restaurant's humble exterior: they make great, authentic Chinese cooking with fresh ingredients. I had dinner here the other night and was pleasantly surprised by both the number of vegetarian options and their freshness. We ordered the vegetarian spring rolls, hot and sour soup, mushroom and tofu congee, and vegetable chow mein. It was some of the best spring rolls and hot and sour soup I'd ever had. Plus, our total cost for two people came to $22.  Excellent service from the owners, a lovely Mandarin family; we had a great conversation, and somehow food took very little time to arrive!"}
