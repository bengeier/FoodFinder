{"text":"Fish is so good! Love the salmon! Friendly staff! They also have a great eggs Benedict for breakfast! Highly recommend this place, u won't be disappointed. If u like to have a cocktail, u have to try the brandie old fashioned sweet!"}
{"text":"Had the lobster eggs benedict.  I was suprised how much lobster there was, probably a whole lobster tail between the two muffins.  My wife had the lobster omlet, same story.  Lobster was plentiful.  Her parents were along also, and they each got the walleye breakfast which they enjoyed.  Ultimate bloody mary was excellent also."}
{"text":"Been here a few times. Once for breakfast and few times for drinks/apps. Food has been very good and the service is decent. They don't have the best view of the lake but we'll still be back."}
{"text":"Never had a bad meal here, breakfast lunch or dinner.  Prices are very reasonable and the people are very welcoming.  One thing that needs improvement is the coffee.  I think they let the hot water wink at the grounds.  Way to weak."}
{"text":"Went to the green lantern for a friday fish fry. For dinner time we got seated pretty fast. There's a up stairs seating area were we got a seat looking at the water. We had the cod it was pretty good but kinda expensive."}
{"text":"I'll start with I've been to the Green Lantern many times - tonight was one of the worst experiences we've ever had dining out period. 
We decide to take the family out after work/school for dinner locally so we choose the Green Lantern. We have an 11 year old, 6 year old, and 1-1/2 year old so anyone with children understands that kids are typically starving at dinner time. It's not busy so things should go smoothly right? We order drinks, appetizer, and the entrees right away since we've been here before and the kids are starving. We get the salads and app right away which was mediocre at best. Crab cakes which are my wife's favorite and she didn't even finish the plate. The wait for entrees was getting long and the little kids were getting restless especially the 1-1/2 year old. When the plates were being delivered of course the waitress dropped a couple of them which \"Murphy's law\" says its the kids food who are impatient ones. The waitress says she sorry and puts a quick order in right away. My wife and I ordered steak which the kids won't eat so they have nothing. BTW they ordered chicken strips and fries so not very hard to make. By now the young one is having a full on meltdown and the 6 year old needs to use the restroom. \"Awesome\" they eventually deliver the chicken strips only to find that they are raw in the middle. We ask to have carry out containers so we can put our steaks in and leave. The waitress was so generous and gave us $10 off the bill (little sarcasm) 
We head home and have to stop at Culvers to grab the kids dinner while are steaks are getting cold in styrofoam containers. To top everything else off my steak was very rare almost raw in the middle which I ordered \"medium\"
Long story short very disappointed with service and food."}
{"text":"We go to the Green Lantern a handful of times each year. We went last night for my husband's birthday and the food was just okay. He loved his crab legs (this time). We asked for fries with both of our entrees and they were luke warm and seemed like they had been sitting for a while. Same with the cup of soup. It was almost cold - but it tasted good otherwise. Not sure how long it had been sitting for. My filet was done the way I wanted it, but I asked for a substitution of scallops instead of shrimp with my meal and they are refusing to make substitutions any more. If it is a matter of costs, I am more than happy to add a few bucks to my meal costs, but they were completely unwilling to do this. Not sure what the big deal is. There were only 2 other tables being served at the same time. So, overall, really average for spending $60 on 2 meals."}
{"text":"I have no idea how The Greenie made Madison Magazine's list of best fish frys.  The food is old school and not in a good way; the deep fryer is the most used piece of kitchen equipment and, unfortunately, they don't filter/change the oil often so that everything has an off taste. They have tried to update the menu and introduce new items, but there's only so much creativity that happens when Sysco is their main purveyor.  Veggies are of the canned and frozen variety and the salads, YIKES don't even get me started.  So, you say, the food is bad but how about the bar?  Well, if you like the regulars sitting in the bar stools and getting all of the attention from the unfriendly bartenders, then this place is for you.  Sure they can make an old-fashioned or pour a beer, but the Madison-area has plenty of other supper clubs that can make a better cocktail and meal than The Greenie."}
{"text":"Life is good. In bloody mary heaven. Joy's not bad either :-)"}
{"text":"The biggest plus is it is on the lake with a dock and open for breakfest.

That is huge if your a fan of a boating trip to eat ...I'll swing by soon to actually eat there again ...it's been 3 years since we had a boat.

We did find a used boat ...now we may return.

I guess that says a lot as without the boat, we do not go, with a boat, its a 6 out of 5 stars!!!!"}
{"text":"We went to the Green Lantern last Friday and it was our first visit there.Several of our friends had always spoken highly of it so we thought we would give their Friday Fish fry a try. I had made reservations for us and when we got to the restaurant they informed us it would just be a few more minutes and that we could take a seat at the bar.The bartender was very nice and intuitive, he noticed I was eying up the pickled mushrooms and gave me some for my cocktail.A few minutes later we were promptly seated so the wait was not long at all.We were seated at a nice table by the window with a view of the lake.So far so good.We ordered a kalamari appetizer to share, three beer battered cod fish fry dinners and one breaded shrimp dinner.The kalamari came first and it was ok. Our drinks were finished so we ordered more.Finally she came with our entrees but still no beer we had ordered to go with our meals.So we reminded her again.My fish fry was warm and the fish was flaky.My moms fish fry,however, was cold and soggy and we had ordered the same thing.The cole slaw was good and tasted fresh and the hash browns I had ordered were good as well.My partners shrimp though was awful.It was greasy and mushy and tasted awful.The French fries accompanying it were undercooked and looked anemic, some of them had black coloring on them like the bad part of a potato that has rotted.Our server was still no where to be seen in order to ask about our drinks or inform her about the cold fish,soggy shrimp and undercooked fries.Finally we asked another waitress if she could find her.When we told her we were disappointed in the food,particularily the shrimp and undercooked potatoes she asked why we hadn't told her sooner, to which I really wanted to respond that not once did she check in with us to see how our meal was.She did handle it all professionally in the end and apologized, even took half off of our bill so that was nice.However, between one of us having basically no good entree at all and this being our first time there it really was a disappointment.Like I said the hashbrowns and coleslaw were good, the bartender and hostess service was good but we came there for a good fish fry and dinner service.Next time we are going to Tobys nearby instead.They consistently serve quality food along with good service."}
{"text":"Good food, cheap drinks, great service. Breakfast is simple, but delicious here- get the Wiggies (hashbrowns with cheese, onions, ham and green pepper inside). Sandwiches are also good, and it's a great place for fish fry."}
{"text":"This place is like an old up-north supper club. It's dark and cozy with orange light lanterns hanging from the ceiling. The upper seating level has a lovely view of the lake. 

I got the lobster omelet and it had this wonderful, flavorful tarragon sauce over the top. Big chunks of lobster made it a memorable breakfast. My english muffin was perfectly toasted and buttered.

My companion recommends trying the walleye breakfast next time.

Our server was very very very nice and sweet. Several times she uttered \"take your time, no hurry.\" I hear that's the Green Lantern's tag line: loitering encouraged. I like to relax, so this place is perfect. If I lived in the area I'd go there for drinks."}
{"text":"Soup, lukewarm.  Three main dishes, lukewarm.  These were all specials and had to be microwaved.  Drinks came after soup.  A spoon and a knife were dirty.  I asked for a clean knife and never received it.  This was at noon on a Wednesday.  Someone was missing a napkin and asked for one.  The waitress never did bring it. The soup was reheated and brought out after the main course was delivered.   After all this, they charged us $8.00 for a small birthday cake.  Now that I think about it, 2 Stars was probably too high.  Bad service and reheated food."}
{"text":"Went for Brunch on a Sunday. Place was packed. Fortunately, we had reservations for 6 at 11 and our table was ready. Service was great and the food awesome. Even though they were at capacity, we did not have to wait abnormally long for our food. The Walleye and eggs w hashbrowns was a bargain at $9.99. Large fillet lightly breaded and cooked to perfection. Kudos to the kitchen staff. 
Even if you don't have a reservation, they turn over the tables quickly. By the time we left at about 1, there were many open tables."}
{"text":"Build Your Own Bloody Mary and Wiggies with breakfast! Nice spot on the lake too!"}
{"text":"Our group of four came on a Friday night for fish. It was around 8pm so the Friday Fish fry rush had subsided. 

Our waitress was very friendly taking drink orders right away (but seriously,  who doesn't have bud light on tap?). Our food was brought to us within 10 min. Even the waitress remarked this was the fastest turn around all night. 

The fried cod (~$13 for 3 pcs) was golden,  flaky,  and had depth of flavor. It was one of the best fish fry we've ever had. The pieces are big, so much so that I needed a box for the last piece. The baked fish was actually cheaper than fried,  arrived in a single piece. Our dinner companion commented how good the flavor was. 

You get a choice of potato (hashbrowns,  baked,  fries), or opt for broccoli and either a salad or coleslaw. 

The bread rolls were pretty good too.

I'd recommend this place especially when we have longer days for a view of the lake with your dinner!"}
{"text":"What should happen if you find a BEETLE in your meal?

A. Still pay for the whole meal. 
B. Pay for everything, except the BEETLE dish. 
C. Significant discount. 
D. Not pay for anything. 

Yes. A BEETLE was in our food that we shared with our 1year old son. Not to mention a significant amount of flies around our table, too. 

We will not go back. EVER."}
{"text":"The Green Lantern is the kind of place that comes in right above the Mendoza Line.  What I mean by this is the quality of the meals and the atmosphere of this supper club is good enough to warrant return visits but not to elicit rave reviews.  I'm not a supper club kind of guy, so right off the bat a place like the Green Lantern isn't going to be my favorite.  However there are plenty of old school supper clubs that do a nice enough job that I've got no qualms tagging along for dinner on a Friday night.  The Green Lantern is one of these places, albeit just barely.

My friend, however, absolutely loves this place.  As such I've had cause to dine here many times over the years.  There are quite a few pluses.  The bartenders are quick and generally friendly, and they've got an adequate tap selection including Ale Asylum offerings.  I love the location right off the lake, and two-thirds of the seating areas have great atmosphere.  The service has always been above average and I can't think of a bad experience - this type of consistency over the years is very hard to maintain.  They've got Wiggies, which are kind of like low-rent roesti - hashbrowns with onions, peppers and American cheese.  And finally the Green Lantern is obviously popular with the denizens of McFarland.  I don't recall a single trip out here where the bar wasn't mostly full and the restaurant hopping.

The negatives: first and foremost I've always found the menu to be pretty limited.  I'm not big on fish fry, and the Green Lantern's Friday night menu doesn't have much else aside from sandwiches and a grilled chicken breast entree.  Now as I said, I'm not big on fish fry so my opinion should be taken lightly, but the times that I have ordered the fish I've been underwhelmed.  This is probably just me - my friend simply can't get enough of the stuff.  Prices are moderately high for the perceived quality, though the bar is quite reasonable.  There's also a bit of a hassle when it comes to paying the bill.  While I've never had any concerns with service from the waitstaff, I have stood around for upwards of 15 minutes waiting to have the hostess swipe my card.  That is unacceptable and it's unfortunately led to smaller tips to otherwise deserving waitresses.  Finally, it always seems that after waiting 20-30 minutes for a table on a Friday night we always end up either in the basement or at one of the few poorly located tables upstairs.  

If it were just up to me I don't think I'd be going to the Green Lantern all that much.  After all, I don't live in McFarland and I don't really go for supper club fish fries.  But so long as I know people that love going here I'll tag along and have a decent enough time.  I think you'd be hard pressed not to at least be able to do that at the Green Lantern."}
{"text":"We love The Green Lantern. The food is wonderful and the price is great. We have never had a long wait for a table and once we are seated we are always waited on right away. All the staff is very friendly and atmosphere is welcoming. We have taken several friends here for dinner and always have a great time."}
{"text":"I never planned on going in the restaurant, but the person I was meeting with to sail was running late, so I went inside. I barely sat down, and the bartender asked me if I needed anything. I ordered a bloody mary, and all I had was my credit card. She said that they had a $10 minimum, but she would \"figure it out\". When I was ready to settle my bill, she told me that it was no problem. Btw, the bloody mary was delicious. Not overloaded with too much stuff and had a good, smokey flavor. I will be back."}
{"text":"Very drab and dingy interior that was not very appealing and there was quite a bit of dust on the \"decorations\".

As for the food, I ordered the bacon wrapped filet medium rare and although the steak was cooked properly, it was a horrible cut of meat and tore apart like how fish flakes. On top of that, the bacon around the filet was still raw meaning they didn't par-cook it before wrapping. 

Also, the baked potato on the side was raw in the center and cold. Apparently no one told them people stopped wrapping bakers in foil years ago.

Will not return."}
{"text":"Who does not love the Greeny?  As some posts before me it is a place you can go and have a good time no matter what and just be you.  The staff is awesome and the food is decent.  But the Green lantern has something that other places try to imitate, atmosphere. 

I have seen bar after bar try and create a fun atmosphere but they cannot.  The Greeny has it and I wish I could get there more than I do."}
{"text":"The Lantern doesn't profess to be anything more than it is. Good American, wisco supper club fare. Prices are very good, and they know how to cook a steak to temperature. Bloody Mary's are great as they allow you to add your own seasonings to taste.  Decent wine selection by the glass.  They even have sambuca. 
Try the surf n turf. Very good at a great price. 
Also fried chicken. 
Solid choice, and nicest place on lake waubesa."}
{"text":"Looking for \"that\" spot where the moment you walk in, you fit in?  

Looking for a home cooked meal...without having to lift a finger? 

Looking for a place to pop a squat and shoot the shit?

Look no further than the Greenie!  

Breakfast, lunch, happy hour or dinner....it always fills the bill. 

Love taking the family there for weekend breakfast.  From the waffle sundae for my youngest to the seafood omelet for me...they have it all.  Huge portions...great prices! 

Swing in and ask for my favorite bartender, Joy to make you her ultimate bloody mary made with Effen Cucumber Vodka.  Yeah...she rocks it.  

It's all good..."}
{"text":"It's friday night, in the middle of a storm, and all levels of the dinning room is packed. 30 minute wait wasnt bad, the bar was fast and the drinks strong."}
{"text":"Ever since moving to Wisconsin, we've been wanting to try the Supper Clubs which Wisconsin is known for. The Green Lantern surpassed my expectations.

The location is right on Lake Waubesa. There is a beautiful view out the window and after supper you can stroll down the pier and continue to admire the lake. The interior is divided into a pub area, the room with the window, and an extension below that. Lots of wood and lanterns -- it's cozy.

The hostess and especially our waitress were fun and friendly. She seemed to really enjoy her job.

The food is what sold us though. We each started w/a half dozen oysters on the half shell. These were shucked, no grit, still had their juice, decent sized and briny flavor. Served with a lemon wedges and a good sized portion of shrimp sauce. This is exactly how I want my oysters and the price was right.

There's no salad bar, but I enjoyed my salad which I ordered with blue cheese dressing. Often I'm disappointed with blue-cheese dressing and it just tastes like ranch, but this dressing was great. The blue cheese really shined. I also ordered the rib-eye steak and baked potato. The steak was perfectly cooked, tender, juicy, so delicious. No complaints about the potato nor the bread.

Ambiance, service, great food, AND reasonable prices, I highly recommend the Green Lantern!"}
{"text":"Great Fish Fry and wonderful view. I've recommended them several times to several friends."}
{"text":"Well, they were open and the staff was nice. Crab cake appetizer that was gummy. I had fried shrimp/hash-browns and my wife had the fried chicken/French fries. Mediocre at best. I guess you stick to sandwiches or the specials?"}
{"text":"I'm sure if I drove far enough outside of Minneapolis I'd find a place about as awesome as the Green Lantern. Instead of doing all of that work, I just wish the Green Lantern would move into my backyard.

I HATE bars where I feel like I have to do a lot of work just to try to have a good time. I'm not dressing up or drinking a certain drink just to feel like I have a shot of being accepted somewhere, believe me. The Green Lantern rules because it's completely laid back and totally unpretentious. I've seen such a wide variety of people there and everyone is always having a great time.

Besides, the drinks are super strong and cheap - that alone is good enough for me."}
{"text":"The spinach artichoke dip and crispy queso burger we had were worth every penny! Green Lantern has a nice bar and a few pool tables. Its a nice place to enjoy the view of the lake on evenings and laidback ambience to enjoy."}
{"text":"I went last Saturday for Karaoke and had a fun time! Drink prices are reasonable and the staff is friendly. It's definitely a different atmosphere than your downtown karaoke bar but very laid back and not super crowded. I have not eaten here in a long time but the reviews for the food sound great!"}
{"text":"annual family after party breakfast meetup location for hangover food. 4th year and going. still got it going here at green. great service, good food, good coffee and great daily specials for killer prices. I don't see the green leaving our holiday plans anytime soon."}
{"text":"I love the Green Lantern breakfast. I also love that they open early on weekdays for breakfast. Great prices, good food, friendly service. Any day that I have a free morning after work, I try to stop in here. The food is good - nothing fancy, but simple food done well. My husband grew up in the area and I'm sure the place looks exactly the same as the day he was born - sometimes that's just what you're looking for! The staff in the morning is always very kind and attentive, and they pour a lovely, stiff drink! Gets very busy for a Friday fish fry, but always a fun place to go. The place is wheelchair accessible, but if you are in a wheelchair and have to go to the bathroom.... challenges probably await you."}
{"text":"We ate there several weeks back so the details are a bit thin, but I do recall that the service was good and we enjoyed the burger, club sandwich, and ham and cheese our group had.  Its exactly what you'd expect for a good supper club."}
{"text":"Have eaten here several times,most recently this morning..Food has always been good but todays breakfast was exceptional..I had eggs and walleye.Large piece of walleye,flaky,lightly breaded,and delicious! Companion had lobster benedict special which was raved about..To top it off the service provided by April was outstanding...."}
{"text":"We had heard about the walleye and eggs for brunch.  We had to try them.

Outside they had a neon sign that read IMMEDIATE SEATING.  We got it in and there was a 20 minute wait.  We thought, \"OK this better be good\" and ordered some bloodies.  

They offer up 2 types of bloddies- a DIY and the house special.  We tried the house special.  It wasn't the best in the world but it did the trick.

The walleye and eggs were a pretty good combination.  I had my eggs over easy with extra crispy hash browns.  They were cooked perfectly.  The walleye was a pretty big portion and was darn tasty.  My girlfriend's over easy eggs were extremely runny.  She insisted that she was ok with it.  If it were me I would have asked for a new order. Eggs shouldn't form a puddle on your plate. She ate the whole thing though...

All in all it was good.  When I do brunch I normally don't like to wait. I'm usually hungover, crabby and hungry. So Im not sure that I'd rush back for brunch.  They did have signs advertising their free buffet during Packer games.  That might be worth checking out..."}
{"text":"I have been going here for the fish fry for years and rate it one of the best in the Madison area. Today we had lunch there and it was not as good. I had a chicken caesar rollup and it was very good if you overlook the tortilla and ruffles potato chips are right out the package from the local grocery store. Nothing homemade but as I said it was good.My date had a cheeseburger and stopped eating it after two small bites. I tried it and agreed it was poor quality meat with a odd, old meat, taste. There were also more bits of ground up bone and gristle in it then is normal. Poor quality meat that even catchup and mustard couldn't mask.Ugg! I still like the place where you can sit at a sunny window and watch the lake but I'm not sure my companion would come back after the experience. Service was good and the prices are average."}
{"text":"I have never eaten at the Green Lantern, but whatever.  What I HAVE done is gone to karaoke there.

I am not the kind of person to enjoy a \"hip\" bar.  I don't want ironic metal on the jukebox or $8 flirtinis.   What I want is totally unpretentious karaoke renditions of Unskinny Bop from people that still look like they graduated high school in 1991, and $2.50 vodka and cranberry juices."}
{"text":"The food was average, overpriced and I left hungry. Two SMALL pieces of cod, hash browns and a scoop of cottage cheese was around 13 dollars."}
{"text":"We enjoyed a very good breakfast on a Saturday morning in February. I bet the water view is fantastic in the summer! 
Our waitress was busy but very friendly. We decided on a Bloody Mary. You can make your own or have one made for you. We opted to try their version which came with mushroom, olive, pickle, celery and a lime wedge with a beer chaser. It was good! My husband ordered the breakfast walleye with eggs, hash browns and sour dough toast. The walleye was huge - the length of his plate! I decided on the lobster Benedict. Yum, yum!! Rich delicious sauce and large pieces of lobster in every bite. The prices are more than reasonable. This place is a great bet for a great breakfast!"}
{"text":"Pros:
Drinks are ok
Rib eye steak good medium rare with baked potato
Service was friendly and food served warm
Food affordable
relaxing environment, local feel

Cons:
Scallops was to salty
furniture outdated
walleye fish was eh, not enough flavors

It's very Divey, not impressed even when my meal was free."}
{"text":"I've had mixed reviews for this place in the past, but my rating seems to stay within 3-4. My boyfriend and I went there for Halloween yesterday and the cheese curds and strawberry daiquiris were as good as ever (also the bread rolls and salad really hit the spot)! However, my boyfriend ordered the \"all you can eat ribs\" only to find that the \"ribs\" are mashed together rib meat in the form of a meatloaf. He did not enjoy it. I ordered the seafood platter with fish, shrimp, and scallops, and it made me sick to my stomach. I did enjoy the scallops (which I'm very picky about) but the fish lacked any sort of flavor (ever heard of spices?). The staff are friendly, but this wasn't a great visit. I'd go back for drinks though."}
{"text":"I have been coming here since I was a kid. Everything was always great... unfortunately this trip fell very short.
My husband and I came for dinner with some family on a Sunday night. They were not busy at all. Waitress showed up right away to take drink orders which was great. Once our whole party arrived it took a bit for her to take our order. 

I ordered the crab cakes, which anywhere else I normally love, but these where just bad! Also ordered the Gourmet Mac and Cheese which would have been very good if it wasn't runny like soup. I ate all the lobster out of it and pretty much left the rest. My husband ordered some type of burger (don't remember the name) that had jalapeños, onions strings, and Chipotle mayo, you would think it would have been spicy right?!?!? NO he said it had a lot of flavor but no spice at all! And he loves his spicy food.

I have been a waitress for years so I'm not one to complain to the waitstaff when the food is bad  (I know 90%of the time it is not there fault) so we let it go. The service however could have been better the waitress rarely checked back with us and she had a bit of an attitude. Another thing we also let go, it may have just been an off day for her.

Hopefully things are better next time or we may be checking this off our options of places to eat..."}
{"text":"We (my sweetie and I) had dinner here last night and I had so much fun!!  This was the loudest restaurant I have ever been to; we had a party of 12 sitting right behind us and they were LOUD, even singing at one point!  And even with all that I had a great time.  And what do I expect?  It was Friday night in Wisconsin and the fish fryz and old fashioneds were selling like crazy!!  Something I noticed about this supper club (being new to the supper club experience) was that there was a wide range of ages eating and enjoying themselves last night.  

So....here we go.  The restaurant doesn't look like much from the outside, but who cares, right?  I ask myself, was the food good?  Was the place clean?  Service attentive?  And did I have fun?  yes Yes YeS YES!!  We started with oysters, 7 oysters for $7.95!!  I've never!!  That's the least expensive priced oysters you're likely to find anywhere and they were yummy doo!!  I went with the rockafeller this time *snort...little finger in the air*.  Very good.  The rollz were warm and yummy.  I had the ribeye and it was cooked a perfect medium rare....no easy task for a 14 ounce.  Also bear in mind the steak was around $15.  Okay, here's the main reason I took a star off...this was the largest steak on the menu.  Whhhaaaaatt??  Okay, call me a fattapotamus if you must *grin* but I don't order fish on Friday night if I'm not sure the portion will be enough to fill me up so I order steak and this steak tasted great...but it was too small.  It was a ribeye so there was fat I had to trim off.  Why not serve an 18 ounce NY strip?  A 22 ounce porterhouse?  $29.99 hello??  That's okay....I can take the extra home.  I loved that the tab came to around $42 before tip and not including some of the bar tab *cough cough*...but I'm willing to pay a little more for a larger portion.  Anywayz, no sense beating a dead steer, *grin*  my lady had the fish fry and she thought it was good but the batter on the fish was a heavy grainy batter and she thought it might have overwhelmed the fish.  I sort of agreed...my beef *grin* (sorry) was that the fish portions were on the smallish side.  Again, $12.45 for 3 pieces of fish is a great price but charge an extra buck or two and give me something I can sink my teeth into!!  We will be back but my girlfriend (born and raised on the fish fry) said she would try the broiled fish next time and I've NEVER heard her say that before!! hahaha  Lastly, her big like for this restaurant?  Besides the big yellow and red squeeze bottle for catsup and mustard.....they put a great big squeeze bottle of tartar sauce on each table....ya....she likes a little fish with her tartar sauce!!  Later~"}
{"text":"The first time my husband and I went we were there on a Wednesday. I ordered some type of sandwich that came with chips. I was expecting pub chips but instead they put ruffles from a potato chip bag on my plate. The second time we went was on a Friday night. We both ordered the fish fry. It was horrible. I won't be back. The greatest part of the evening was our waitress. The food was barely warm. I was expecting something amazing in regards to the fish fry because that's all the locals in McFarland talk about, but the Maple Tree down the road is WAY better!!! The parking at the Green Lantern is inconvenient. It stinks inside the building like my grandmothers basement, the fish tasted frozen, and the green Christmas lights inside are ridiculous."}
{"text":"I have been going to the Greenie since I was a child 40 years ago, either by boat or car. We went down tonight and they had bluegill for a special for Friday night fish fry. Best freshwater fish I've ever had in my life, light batter and not too salty! Thank you Green Lantern, oh yeah, they also had Hopalicious Fantasy Factory and Dogfish Head On Tap!"}
{"text":"The man and I are on this thing now where we are trying to eat at a few places famous for their fish fry's thanks to an article in Madison Magazine.  There are a few places in the mag that I am looking forward to trying but Green Lantern was the first one that we hit up.  

Driving up the place looked kind of small and beat up which was not what I was expecting and not looking forward to.  As we got closer however I realized how big this place was on the inside.  It's huge!   At least it felt huge from where we were sitting.  I'm not sure if it was the article in the magazine that attributed to how crazy busy this place was or if there was a concert or what but this place was insane.  I mean we had to wait for an hour for our table.  On the plus side we had to wait an hour for our table which meant an hour of drinking so I can't really complain.

Because we had been waiting for so long we also had a chance to look at the menu so when we  finally sat down we knew exactly what we wanted; the waitress loved this.  We started with the calamari which I'm starting to find out is not one of Wisconsin's strong suits.  I don't think I have ever had good calamari here; maybe this will be my next food challenge 'The Great Calamari Showdown'!  Anyway, I had a few pieces of that and let the man have the rest'' he actually really liked it.  

I ordered the salad which was huge, cheesy mashed potato, and 3 pieces of the lightly breaded cod.  The man order the same but with cheesy hash browns.  The fish was pretty good.  It was juicy and fresh and not bad.  I thought it was maybe just a little over the top with the seasoning.  I think I would have enjoyed it more if the flavors were a bit more subtle as opposed to all up in my face the way it was.  With that said however I though it was alright.  The man on the other hand was in love.  He likened his enjoyment of this place to the Tornado Room.  Pure blasphemy.  He clearly doesn't know anything about food. 

All in all I am glad I tried this place but I don't think I will be making it a regular haunt."}
{"text":"Any place that's located on a lake for a fish fry is alright with me.. It's packed on Friday which means you get to have a few cocktails while waiting for a table, the wait is worth it... Don't hesitate to try this place out you won't be disappointed.."}
{"text":"My wife and I were really looking forward to going here last Friday, unfortunately we were disappointed.  Our verbal 25 minute wait turned out to be about an hour.  My wife's burger was decent however the walleye on my seafood platter was the worst walleye I've ever had.  Our drinks at the bar were mixed very poorly however overall, the prices are good.  I'd say if you're looking for a good, classic Wisconsin lakeside restaurant, skip this place."}
{"text":"FISH FRY was OUT OF THIS WORLD! I read an article in Madison magazine about how this place had one of the best fish fry's in town and decided to try it out! What a gem! First, The fish fry comes with salad and a side. Super Nice.  Secondly, they must have the world's best tartar sauce! I could literally drink the stuff. Third, I took five people here who all had the fish fry and drinks and it only set me back 60 Bucks! WOW! I will be back!"}
{"text":"Long wait on Friday night's. Food was good service was also good. Beer prices higher than expected. Parking was a challenge but expected."}

{"text":"I've been going to the green lantern since I was a kid. 20 years later and nothing has changed.. literally nothing. It's dirty, full of flies, and servers seem like they want to jump off a cliff.

Came here for a Friday night fish fry and our server was very rude. She watched us swat flies out of our food with our place mats and didn't do a thing about it. Maybe next time move your customers to a different location when they're being infiltrated with flies. Maybe give the chairs and walls a nice cleaning in your downtime instead of chain smoking cigarettes outside the kitchen. Which brings me to my next point, the place constantly smells like cigarette smoke. Yuck.

Until renovations happen, I will not be back. Dirty."}
{"text":"Under ordinary circumstances I'm not a breakfast person.  However, the morning after Thanksgiving, it was obviously time to consume more food, so off to the Green Lantern we went.  And a good thing too...I had the best breakfast I have eaten in recent memory, and left totally impressed (and full).

Breakfast foods are simple foods.  Many places take advantage of the simplicity by rushing things along.  You end up with edible but uninspired eats.  Though my breakfast arrived shortly after it was ordered, it was cooked properly and with care.  My sunny side up eggs were perfectly done, the whites well set and the yolks warm but properly runny.  The four (!) large slices of bacon were thick and flavorful.  I ordered the hash-browns crispy, and that's how they came.  Everything on the plate was cooked just right and tasted super good.  I could almost like eating breakfast out, if every place served breakfast like this.

Service was fast and friendly.  Coffee was the usual diner style, weak and plentiful.  The bar looked capable of producing a solid bloody mary, but alas this went untested.  Prices were as cheap as the day is long.  I'm docking a star for the corn beef hash--it lacked flavor and that all important crunch.  All the same, I still highly recommend the Lantern for your breakfast needs."}
{"text":"Stopped in for a dinner after getting a recommendation from a co worker and we were VERY impressed!  It was fairly quiet on a Thursday night - no problem getting a table.  The location is fabulous being right on the lake with views.  The ambiance is very much a north-woods tavern restaurant type establishment - older decor, a little kitschy, though it suits the place, well.

Green Lantern has a reputation of being a surf-turf and they do it well!

I had the Ahi-tuna - it was an incredibly delicate piece of fish cooked perfectly.  My wife had a steak which was also prepared very well.  We are DEFINITELY coming back!

The server, while young and a bit 'nervous', did a fine job and she was very pleasant.  She also provided great suggestions for food pairings!  Well done :)

Hint:  Ask for a seat by the window to get a view of the lake.
hint hint:  The location, ambiance, and setup is VERY family and kid friendly!  They were hosting a birthday party for a grandmother while we were there and the staff bent-over backwards for the family and party - including setting up a powerpoint projector for family slide show and music!  Very sweet...."}
{"text":"Decent breakfast. I've been there a few times for that. Recently tried their bacon wrapped tenderloin and it was terrible. The meat was chewy and tough and the bacon around it looked like it was wrapped in white snot. Just plain bad. Don't go here for steak"}
{"text":"Friday Night Fish Fry! reasonable prices and good service. Go with the standards and you will enjoy!"}
{"text":"After an afternoon kiteboarding on Lake Waubesa, my friend (and sifu!) and I were ravenously hungry. The Green Lantern was right up the hill. Crab cakes app: so delicious, if a bit pricey. But, there was plenty of crab in them and not much filler. 1/3 pound Angus burger and fries: also delicious. Service was great, attentive, and friendly. They refilled our waters like a million times; it was a blessing to be re-hydrated so thoroughly. They have a breakfast menu that includes lobster Benedict! I want this (next time)! My one issue: the music playing over the PA was gratingly bad. Emo corporate rock- just BAD. It caused some auditory pain, so one less of a star for that. At least it wasn't that loud. Also, there was a train stopped on the tracks nearby. Dang, I love trains."}
{"text":"For the price my just warm baked cod was okay but had little taste sitting in  water. Sides of hot baked potato and basic iceberg lettuce salad were fine. Waitress Amber was courteous and attentive. I enjoyed dinner until our party of 5 was asked to leave because they needed the table. Really? We were quite dismayed and told the male cashier whose response was defensive and frankly, rude. He even said if he were here co-owner Al would have asked us to leave just as the other co-owner did tonight. Wow. If true I am disappointed, Al. Your staff just lost us as customers including the other party waiting in line who walked out after us upon hearing our complaint and the cashier's response. Boo, bad customer service and not worth the food."}
{"text":"We accidentally found Green Lantern when another local eatery was closed for Sunday night. We couldn't have been more happy that the other place was closed as Green Lantern had friendly service, tasty food, and the Packers on tv screens everywhere you looked. It's a restaurant and bar, and the building isn't modern, so leave any judgmental aesthetic attitudes at home (or, in our case, the hotel room) and go enjoy something other than another boring chain."}
{"text":"The food is always incredible.  This is our Friday fish fry place and I don't eat fish.  There are lots of options for us folks that can pass on fish.  It's a older place, but really clean.  It's an environment of a supper club, and is kid friendly.  Car seats are more than welcome.  Full bar for your pleasure, no blender for frozen drinks.  The one star left off to make it five stars is for parking.  Get there before 6:00 pm or street parking; which isn't horrible.  Lastly, try and eat on the first floor as the basement is a basement."}
{"text":"When this place hits the mark, it's above average and when it misses it stinks. I've done breakfast and dinner here and with mixed results. I've had great omelettes and cold fatty prime rib with delayed drinks. Either way it's middle of the road for price. If this place wasn't as close as it is I can't see a reason I would go back. The best part of the place is the view which at breakfast gives a nice view of the lake."}
{"text":"We love this place!  This restaurant has excellent food!  It has been family owned for years and that is what makes the difference.  Love being regulars here!  Friday night fish fries are always good.  Scallops are really worth trying.  Salads are always fresh.  Chili is very thick and meaty. This place and staff are always welcoming even when you arrive by boat!  Highly recommend it.  Be sure to  check out their specials on their awesome website!  http://www.thegreenlanternrestaurant.com."}
{"text":"Always good food. Menu seems to have been updated recently. Lake perch really nicely done. Upper dining room has been remodeled. Quite nice!  A favorite."}
{"text":"A simple diner  style breakfast at a great value  .  The fourth star is for service - Amber was personal and attentive  - everything was done with a genuine smile"}
{"text":"A friend brought us here and we now come here regularly. All those visits and the only thing that we do is the old fashioned and jumbo shrimp. 

The old fashioned is Madison's (un)official state cocktail. Do it right and get it with Korbel brandy and have it sweet. From what I hear, this was the way the whiskey cocktail was made when it first came out. When bartenders tried to play around with cocktails that were made with sours / gin / seltzer, regulars told the bar tender to just give it to me the old fashioned way. 

If you are smart you would have noticed that it started out as a whiskey cocktail and I just told you to get Korbel brandy. Well. That's Madison's version of it since it is rumored that folks in this part of the state (Germans?) preferred brandy to whiskey. 

The jumbo shrimp is the other must have. Breaded or broiled they are both pretty awesome. Bring a date / friend along and get one of each. 5 jumbo shrimp with fries and a salad can make a pretty good meal. 

P.S. Don't forget to check out the view of the lake before you leave."}
