{"text":"Located at vaughan mills, South Street Burger Co is a good alternative to the typical spots in the food court. I ordered the Mushroom Swiss with Char Broiled Chicken Breast. The burger itself was great. My buddy got the same burger but with a beef patty and she didn't enjoy it as much as I enjoyed mine. Found the price to be up there for lunch but it's standard to lunch at vmills."}
{"text":"My first 3 star review.
I really can't write that the food was terrible because it really wasn't. The problem is that it was nothing special. The burger had gristle and was salty, boring. The toppings are nothing special. Offering one \"special\" topping and one generic topping is not worth the prices they ask. $11.00 for a combo? I'd rather go to Moxies and get a burger from them for the same price. Much better. All the hype for these \"specialty burger houses\" just makes the disappointment they offer that much worse. Lower the prices, offer more selection and give more fries, then you might be worth the hype. As it stands these places Hero burger/South St/Five guys are nothing more than hyped up dives with not much more to offer than the \"regular\" burger dives."}
{"text":"South Street Burger Co. is a child of New York Fries, who are moving out of french-fry territory into the expanses of this new 'higher-end' burger culture, probably hoping to compete with the likes of Hero burger, Fatburger, Licks (does Licks still exist?), etc, etc...
This is one of their several newly-opened GTA restaurants, opened this year with the addition of the new wing to Vaughan Mills. They have a bunch of restaurants in the GTA, one in Calgary, oddly enough one in Dubai, but, despite the name, none in New York or any in the United States whatsoever for that matter. 
Their menu includes, of course, New York Fries' signature french fries and poutines, alongst with burgers, salads, milkshakes, I think there was some sort of chicken sandwich too...
Like its competitors, South Street tries to further an image of highly 'customizable' burgers, so they have a fair amount of options on the toppings...along with the standard cheddar cheeses you could also opt for goat cheese, pepperjack, or brie, they have a wide variety of different sauces (tho not as much as Hero burger, I think), fair selection of toppings, different types of mayo, different types of mustard, even different types of ketchup (regular or spicy) to choose from...
I ordered the veggie burger on a whole-wheat bun, with mushrooms, goat cheese, lettuce & tomato, chipotle sauce. Was 14 bucks for the combo (they charge $1 for cheese and same for mushrooms! When did it become the standard to charge extra for cheese on a burger!)...so, about the same as any other burger place of similar class. 
The employees were overtly friendly and cheerful to such a degree that it became somewhat icy, it was obvious their good-naturedness was contrived and forced, but don't hold me fast to that conviction as I'm not the best judge of people's temperaments. Just my impressions. 
The patty was decent, the bread was surprisingly good, the goat cheese was tasty, very creamy, and they were quite generous with it, toppings are about what you'd expect...
All in all 'decent', nothing spectacular, but hey it's just a burger place in a shopping mall. You usually get what you expect with this sort of thing."}
{"text":"Love this place.  Been coming here for awhile, the burgers are always on point.  I recommend the 6oz Hawaiian burger.  Milkshakes are also excellent!"}
{"text":"Good but definitely not great. The store looks fantastic and the concept is sound. But... when I was there around 1:30pm it was understaffed and between ordering and receiving my meal it took almost 15 mins - not acceptable.

I also asked for one additional topping to be added to my burger and it was omitted by the person assembling the burgers. Also the price ...$25 for 2 x burger combo meals is also a bit rich. Food was tasty but the experience and price will ensure I don't try this place again. Try at your own risk..."}
{"text":"Relative fast meal.  Good burger.  Fries were great though. I would recommend this as the best burger place at Eglinton and yonge"}
{"text":"The vibe is the perfect mix of industrial cool and relaxed, the service super friendly, and the burger one of the best I've had yet in Toronto. The fries are impressive (NYF, and they actually taste like potatoes!) and the beef in the burgers is clearly fresh and cooked to perfection. I had a nacho burger which had fantastic guac and salsa and my friend described her gluten free bun as the best she's yet had in Toronto. Will return."}
{"text":"As a regular listener of the Fan 960 sports radio station here in Callgary, and a guy who genuinely likes to shop, having a place voted the \"Best Burger in Calgary\" inside a brand new outlet mall seemed like an easy choice. I have been to Cross Iron Mills before and everytime I walked past South St. Burger Company  I said \"I'll go next time.\" Since the last time I had been here, the listeners of the Fan 960 voted it the best burger in the city which cemented the \"I'll go next time,\" line, in stone. This place has been open for just about a year so maybe people like a new kid in town when it comes to burgers.

I was there at 5:00pm on a Saturday. The mall was packed and so was South Street. I kept it simple and ordered the hamburger combo and paid extra for cheese. South St serves New York Fries as their side. Kind of a nice touch. The beef is not frozen and is cooked to order. This seems to be getting trendy as Wendy's advertises this. 

It kind of works caferteria style. You order and pay, then slide your tray down the line where you have a choice between a white and a whole wheat bun. Then they dress the bun while the burger cooks with your choice of their toppings.

Given how busy it was, it didn't take too long for the burger to be ready. I went with a whole wheat bun, blue cheese, lettuce, tomato, pickles, onions, ketchup, mustard and relish.

The burger was really good. The bun was awesome. It was definitely the best part of the burger. Probablly the best burger bun I ever had. It was very soft and tasty. All in all, in my opinion, this is definitely not the best burger I ever had in Calgary, but having said that, for a place that is kind of like a fast food joint, it buries any of their competition. I can see myself grabbing a burger here everytime I at that mall and it is definitely worth checking out, but it's not the best burger in Calgary. Burger (with cheese), fries and a drink came to $10.50."}
{"text":"The cashier that took our order was a young black female. We ordered three small hamburger combos but she was charging us for the regular size and when we corrected her she gave us a very bad look and attitude. As we're waiting for our burgers to be made we noticed that there were four fries when in fact we only should have gotten three and the cashier had charged for the extra fries. She actually blamed us the customer for making the mistake. To add to this while we were sitting down eating our meal the cashier kept glancing back at us with dirty looks. This type of service is completely unacceptable considering that she is the first point of contact for the business whereas the cooks were the ones that were actually friendly."}
{"text":"Pricey but yes, nice to have options like whole wheat bun, goat cheese and many options you don't get at other burger joints."}
{"text":"I just had my first south st burger and it was delicious. I ordered from justeat.ca and it came 5 mins early super fresh and hot. The delivery driver was also very polite and friendly.  The portion sizes were spot on. We had two regular poutines a 4oz burger and the grilled chicken burger. So flavorful and plenty condiments to choose from. The burgers were also tidily made and were nice and fresh and not dripping in grease in any way. The packaging was also very neat and everything was packed with care and in a nice  brown paper bag. Will definitely be ordering from here again!"}
{"text":"Great choice for a good old fashion burger and fries.  They have a nice simple menu with a solid selection of quality toppings.  Their veggie burger is one of the best around and competes pretty aggressively with Licks for the top spot in my book.

I love that they are owned by New York Fries since that means awesome fresh cut fries.

My only criticism is the size of portions vs. price.  For a veggie burger combo with fries, drink, and cheese you are paying over $10, but both the fries and drink are pretty minimal.  I'm not looking for US size mega portions, but a proper medium size drink and fries would be a better value."}
{"text":"What a great selection for a burger place! A few bucks more than other places and great food. 

I had an awesome veggie burger with goat cheese. They have a ton of topping options - the only ones you pay extra for are cheese and bacon. 
Chipolte bbq sauce, mango chutney, blue cheese, LOTS. Plus - they serve NY Fries. Yum, I suggest checking it out if you're in the mall doing some shopping."}
{"text":"Finally, a burger joint that lives up to its billing (in a mall of all places, weird!)

Owned and operated by New York Fries, the service is similar to Harvey's in the sense that you can add your own ingredients.

Other than this, it bears little resemblance to said franchise.

Everything here is made to order. The patties are succulent and juicy and gasp, not frozen fresh! A breath of fresh air considering most burger joints in Calgary hide behind a smug veil of deceit about their quality control. Wow, they think so highly of their patrons, don't they? 

The poutine is outstanding, with homemade gravy and cheese curds not like what you would expect in good ole' Quebec, but satisfying nonetheless.

If you're brave enough to make the trek to the Crossiron Mills Mall in Balzac, (and by brave I mean wanting to peruse identical stores to those you'd see in Calgary and spend twice the gas getting there because you hate yourself), then skip the food court and indulge yourself here. 

It may well be one of the top 5 burgers I have had, the only drawback being the price ($12 for a combo meal).

Honorable mention goes to the chicken burger, which is also good."}
{"text":"I went here recently for a burger and fries and a drink.  The servers were friendly, and my food was cooked quickly.

The burger itself was only okay - I didn't enjoy the flavour or texture, but it wasn't terrible.  However I won't likely go back.

On the other hand, the fries were delicious and I liked the burger toppings, especially the cajun onions."}
{"text":"The burger was okay.  Better than McD, but who doesn't.  The menu is okay, toppings are pretty much the same as Harvey's.  But the service was bad."}
{"text":"I got the poutine. the lady who was making it had no interest in making it. I finally got it after a 15 minute wait and she forgot to put cheese curds in the poutine. why do they call it the vegworks poutine when they put only half a spoonful of scallions and tomatoes on it?"}
{"text":"Their turkey burger is so delicious! I'm visiting from out of town and had to write a review after devouring their turkey burger! I customized my toppings and have to admit that I immediately checked to see if there were any locations in Southern California!"}
{"text":"A very nice large place, lots of natural light through the picture windows. The staff is pleasant and helpful. Young supervisors are keeping an eye on things. I always have the chicken burger with fries. And beer!! It's not everywhere you can get beer with your burger. The chicken is very good, a large slab, nicely grilled. They will load your bun with decent relishes. But guys, why don't you pay more attention to your fries?? You have lot going for you, why not first class fries? After all, for me and lot of other folks, fries are the forbidden fruit. To be had once in a while as a treat. Only when one is lucky the fries taste fresh. Other than 'fries anxiety', this is the best burger place at Yonge & Eglinton, The Hole-e-Burger nearby cannot compete. Lately the South St. installed large TV screens, which are broadcasting sports events. This is not a boon for myself, but to be fair, I am not their prime customer."}
{"text":"Great place, nice location.  I really enjoy all the add ons, the burgers are not cheap but worth the price.  I also recommend the poutin fries.  Yes it takes a few more minutes for your burger but I rather wait a few minutes and have it fresh. I also ask for it well done, I find that it taste better."}
{"text":"If I was stranded somewhere and there was no other burger joint nearby then I would force myself to go into South St Burger and get one.

The only thing South Burger has that's exciting are the Numerous Toppings that you can put on your burger

Chicken Burger was very Blah.................
Beef Burger was So So........
Side Salad was stale at the bottom
New York Fries were nothing to rave about 

I will not be going back to this joint anytime soon"}
{"text":"Completely over priced for what you get.    I'm not even in the city, and a cheese burger combo came to $13!

At South Street, they charge more money for half the amount of fries you get at New York fries... even though they are the same company. The burger was tiny. 

Would rather eat at Hero burger, and I hate that place.

If you like a ridiculous amount of topping, and want to spend your hard earned cash on it... then you may like this place. 

if you like regular burgers, dont waste your time at this over priced, low quality, feeble attempt at a burger place."}
{"text":"Coming from the US, I was excited to see so many burger places in Toronto. Over a 14 day stay I tried a bunch of places, and no one could seem to get it right. They would ask me how I wanted the burger cooked, and regardless of what I said they always came out as well done hockey pucks. 

Until, I stopped in at South St. Burger. It was juicy, fresh, and the condiments were tasty. Also, I gave their chicken sandwich a shot and it was wicked good. Very juicy, which is tough to do with chicken breast, and the bacon not only looked, but tasted, freshly cooked.

{"text":"Went here with my sister. We used a voucher from WagJag ($20 of food for $10. I think if we referred enough friends or entered a certain promo code from Telus we got it for $5. Too bad the deal's prolly over now. 'Sigh'). 

I guess the main thing that made this place a four-star establishment (for me) was the fact they had actual multi-grain buns with oats & seeds & other visible goodies embedded within. Regret not getting the bun double toasted though. It cooled down too quickly. 

The organic Mill St. beer my sister ordered was very well-rounded with just the right hints of malty, subtly bitter goodness & the burger patty was a bit dry but you could definitely taste honest filler-free beef. 

The deal made it a huge challenge to get combos with regular-sized burgers. Our burgers were very dinky (as in: NOT 1/3-pounders as we were not that hungry) & they only use half a slice of cheese for the small burgers. I guess no one had ordered small cheeseburgers in awhile since my half slice of Swiss & my sister's half slice of cheddar were getting oily & plastick-y hard (yet neither of us were assertive enough to ask for fresher cheese). 

Their fountain pop was deliciously gassy. I just had to get a refill (I think at least 1 refill is free if you dine in). A tad oversweet but Diet Pepsi tends to be that way which is why I prefer Coke Zero. 

I loved the array of toppings and sauces (e.g. dijon horseradish mayo, gourmet dill pickle relish, hot pepper relish, spicy ketchup, chipotle barbeque, etc.). The spicy, slightly sweet & sour Dijon vinaigrette on my sister's salad was pretty amazing (considering I hate vegetables). 

If I ever came back here again, I would mostly be here for the NYF fries, the onion rings I wanted to order but couldn't (without grossly exceeding the limit of the voucher). I wish they had FRINGS on the menu like Harvey's & charge 3.50 as a compromise between the 3.75 onion rings & 3.25 fries. Is that too damned hard? I hate making such major, life-altering decisions when I'm Turducken-level starving! 

The $5 organic beer was not entirely free & was the only thing that made us exceed the $20 total value of our voucher. Also, I am the most idiotic slave to that rich delicious gravy which was utterly butterly worth the ghastly 90 cents extra. MARRY ME, NYF GRAVY!"}
{"text":"I wasn't overly impressed with the cafeteria-gourmet vibe in South Street.  You pay restaurant prices for a quick burger in a bag and some pretty good fries.  There are tons of great toppings to put on your burger, and the burgers themselves are pretty good, though the one I had was a little dry after taking it home.

The poutine looks pretty good, but I can't justify the extra thousand calories on an already leaden meal.  Service is quick, burgers are expertly assembled like ducks in a row.

I'm just pretty ambivalent about the burgers... it was a better burger than most fast-food joints but not worth the price."}
{"text":"Never have I felt the need to log on to a website and post a scathing review of a restaurant, and yet, here I am, an empty greasy paper bag on the passenger seat and sitting in a parking lot pecking away at the painfully small iPhone keyboard stuck in portrait mode on the yelp app.

Don't get me wrong, I knew exactly what I was in for when I stepped through the doors to the chain restaurant that, while proclaiming itself \"one of the best burgers in Toronto\" also depends on converting mass quantities of raw beef into cooked disc-shaped food items.  I was not expecting a gourmet burger, heck, I wasn't even expecting a great burger.  I was hoping at best to overpay for a decent burger and perhaps a milkshake of some sort.  

However, the noun \"disc\" ended up referring not only to the shape of the burger but also unfortunately is the best descriptor of its texture, consistency, and flavour.  Contrary to the sign at the cash, this burger was *not* cooked to 160F, or at least stayed on the grill for a good 2 or 3 minutes after achieving that supposed nirvana of internal hamburger temperature, straight into a charred, rubbery, cottony puck.

To be fair, I was cheap and only got the small burger, it is quite possible that they are better with the standard 5.6 oz burger.  I will concede that if proven otherwise.

As a side, in a rare moment of sheer unbridled optimism, I ordered the poutine.  It wasn't long before I was reminded of why I normally stick with cynicism, especially with the TO fast food scene.

Fries are your standard NY Fries, skins on, faux-home-fries.  When the girl took out a scoop and started to put some sort of cheese product on them, my heart fluttered momentarily-- could it really be?  Real cheese curds???  As she glopped on a gravy concoction, my mind was racing: NY Fries must know about cheese curds... Why would she have scooped them out?  They must be....

Well all my hopes were mercilessly crushed by the sheer weight of the Ontarian concept of poutine with Capitalism sitting perched on its shoulders.  This were not cheese curds suspended in the room temperature school cafeteria grade gravy.  It was a mozzarella stick chopped into little cubes.  I felt like I was in some sort of culinary horror flick, but instead of wanting to yell \"DON'T OPEN THE DOOR\" at my Schrodingerian past self, I realized that as much as I felt the need to indict the owners and operators of South St burger, it really was me that was the villain in this overplayed B-movie.

Well at least the chocolate milkshake was ok."}

also the person who put meats and bacons to the gril not wearing any gloves..."}

{"text":"$30 bucks for 2 large and 2 small burgers with 2 large sides and 4 drinks. Burgers very good with fresh bun and tons of different toppings like free guacamole. Fries are fresh with decent gravy. Onion rings very good too. The best was the Garlic Mayo. Ask for some on the side to dip your fries in."}
{"text":"was really hungry and had great experiences at the other SS i eat at regularly. was looking forward to trying the Islington and Queensway location. nothing but attitude from walking in the door. aside from repeatedly not getting the order correct, when my friend asked for no cheese on his signature burger and asked that it be put on my burger instead we were told flat out no. i asked again, could you put his cheese on my burger since we're already paying for it. was told no again, to either have it without cheese (pay full price for it anyway) or build the signature burger from scratch without cheese. what happened to customer is write, i wasn't asking for anything for free, just what i was already paying for to be taken from one burger to the other. left without eating there. poor customer service at the paying counter would have been a crappy all around experience. knuckleheads."}
{"text":"The food tastes great and their poutine even satisfies vegetarians as they use veggie gravy.

Staff, for the most part is friendly. Except for the manager, who you'd expect to be the best ambassador of customer service. Too bad she's usually cold and bland. One instance is when I was attempting to pay debit. After inserting my debit card and before inputting my info, it said \"insufficient funds.\" I asked to try again and before I inserted my card the machine said \"card problem, try again.\" I articulated that there might be a problem with the machine and the manager responded, \"it's fine, been working all day.\"

After the transaction finally went through, I explained \"I'm just letting you know there might be a problem because I saw an error message before I put my debit card in.\" Again, cold, she responded \"it's been working all night.\"

I'm guessing she has an all-seeing eye and knows what the debit machine says at all times. Instead of devaluing your customer's advice, perhaps you should welcome it as valuable insight and be appreciative that someone is giving you notice. This isn't an isolated situation. Having been helped by her a couple of times before, she's always stone cold. Try to smile, it might brighten your day.

Point is, I'd try and avoid the manager unless you want your mood brought down. And because of her attitude the establishment loses 2 stars."}
{"text":"South St. Burger has a siren song that I sometimes cannot resist. 

The biggest appeal of South St. is its unique offering of condiments and fillings that you don't find in a typical fast-food burger joint. They also have New York Fries if you're into that. In my case, they also have a convenient location at Yonge and Broadway. 

The burger itself is average. It's tasty, average-size for fast-food (meaning small), and the toppings they offer are actually very good. You can't just say \"everything\" when they ask what you want on your burger because you will be eating more condiments than meat. So, the taste experience can be different each time you go. 

Unfortunately that's where the fun stops. In all the times I've been to South St. (more than I care to admit) I have never waited less than ten minutes to get my order. If you show up at lunch hour, you have the added perk of waiting in line with a bunch of high school kids. In my last visit, the dude manning the grill seemed overwhelmed. He started noticeably banging on the grill, making frustrated faces, hoping to get sympathy from the customers watching him PUT PATTIES ON A GRILL. All he got were some grown-ups shaking their heads disapprovingly. No one cares about your stress when you are getting paid to go through it, especially when we are hungry. 

After that last encounter I felt compelled to write a review, and vowed never to return. The restaurant is simply poorly managed; they never seem prepared for a rush of customers (if you know people come at LUNCH time, maybe you should be ready for it), and the staff/equipment/kitchen seem inadequate for the size of the restaurant. For a burger place that serves average food for above-average pricing, and sub-par service, you can do better in the area. Gourmet Burger Co., Mars Diner, Sunset Grill, Harvey's, or even freaking Burger King if you have to. 

Extra star for wasabi mayo and that they serve alcohol (weird, I know)."}
{"text":"My first time experience was not good at all. Went in with my parents and daughter for lunch, upon asking for a kids menu the girl said they didn't have a kids menu just a 4oz burger. When I asked what a 4oz burger looked like she said its a regular burger with attitude as if I was stupid. The girls on the line also had attitude when asking what toppings I wanted and when my mom asked for guacamole. It seemed everyone working there hated their job. As for the food, it was ok. Definitely not worth the price and crappy customer service. I wont ever go back there and will not recommend this location to anyone!"}
{"text":"Give it a miss.  Beautiful atmosphere but unfriendly staff and poor value.  $52 for 2 adults and 2 children.  Burger bun was soggy and the milkshakes were tiny for $4.25. Better burger sides than 5 Guys but that's the only plus. Stick with 5 Guys."}
{"text":"Clean environment, okay food, unhappy and unfriendly serving staff and manager. Street parking only."}
{"text":"I've settled on South St Burger being the best burger meal (well at least the best fast food burger as Richmond Station's burger is pretty amazing) downtown.  The patty is always fresh off the grill with interesting toppings like cajun onions and guacamole or premium toppings like pineapple or brie.  I like to see them put on the toppings as compared to Hero burger where it's all assembled in the back out of sight.

Perhaps the best part is the fries, courtesy of New York Fries.  They usually finish the burger first and then finish the fries last, so they always come out hot and fresh from the fryer.  I don't think they keep fries in their fry bin like those fast food joints, they just have single portions ready to hit the fryer so they always come out hot, which is how you want it when you freshly grind some sea salt on top or add some cajun spices.

It's also outside the path, which keeps the line-ups short and there always seems to be more than enough available seating."}
{"text":"Popped in for a burger while shopping. It took 15 minutes or so to get the burger done. Slow service and pricey for such small burger. It tasted good but it was not worth it."}
{"text":"I go here anytime I need a good burger fixing. The fries are always hot and fresh and the burgers are custom made so you can add whatever toppings you'd like. They also got a new drink machine so there is plenty of sugary water to choose from! The staff could be a little happier though."}
{"text":"Absolutely awful and we gave them three chances. Horrible service. Dry, cold, lifeless food. Absolutely no action when we complained. Shame on me for trying three times but this place is simply, consistently, completely awful."}
{"text":"Burger was dry and over priced. Clear that employees or management really don't care about their food quality."}
{"text":"The burger was good - I really enjoyed the wasabi mayo.  I really wish they offered a turkey patty though.  Great choice in toppings and sauces.

The fries aren't what they were - I didn't enjoy these at all."}
{"text":"The guacamole was old and tasted bitter.  This is the second time in a row that the server messed up our order.  The burgers are over priced and its a hit and miss as to whether the fries are seasoned.  One last thing, our server assembled our burgers and still wearing the same gloves, went to take an order and handled the cash register.  Will never eat here again."}
{"text":"The burgers are delicious and made using ethically-raised meat. There are loads of toppings to choose from and you really can't go wrong with New York Fries. Yes, it can be pricey. Yes, waiting for your order can take a couple of minutes longer than other places. But considering the rest of what I just mentioned, to me it's very worth it."}
{"text":"Best value for money burger, tons of options for toppings, fresh meat and super clean setting"}
{"text":"Service was nothing to brag about. Cashier was covering her nose because they were cleaning the fridge and it was smelly.....burgers was good. Chocolate shake had no flavor. Expect more for $13+."}
{"text":"Ate here a month ago and forgot to write a review. Take a look at your chicken ( if you order chicken from this place ), as my wife's chicken order was pink and not cooked. With some many options out there, Burgers aren't the best either."}
{"text":"I like New York Fries quite a bit, but their hot dogs are pretty horrible.. so I was a little skeptical at first, but to my surprise, the burgers are quite excellent.  From the choice of topics to price range, they aim squarely at Lick's.  In comparison though, I would say a tad smaller but more flavourful. 

The killer here is all the cool topings, like guaccamole and spicy relish.  And way more.  The key here is to resist the temptation of overloading it with topicings, so you actually taste the beef."}
{"text":"This place is awesome! The burgers taste delicious and the fries are NY fries...who doesn't love them. The burgers have a great taste to them...I hate getting a burger and having it taste like nothing...these burgers have flavour. Plus you can get NY fries plain, poutine or onion rings and homemade milkshakes. We live about 25 minutes away and have no problem making the trip for these awesome burgs. :)"}
{"text":"Only been to this place once and will not visit again. Expensive overpriced burgers with employees that all looked like they didn't want to be there. Burger wasn't great and is definitely not worth the price, fries were average and nothing to rave about. Combos were $10+ and does not live up to the price. Check out Milano's down the street for a better burger and service."}
{"text":"Bland frozen food served by disinterested staff, brought to you by the makers of New York Fries. Dressed-up mall fare aimed at taking a bite out of the gourmet burger market. No amount of spicy ketchup will ever compensate for overcooked, cheap ground."}
{"text":"My go to burger is a Harvey's Great Canadian (previously known as the Angus burger).

This was just as good, no better, no worse.

Friendly service.

Onion rings were a little crispier than I'd like, but not bad."}
{"text":"It's just your average run of the mill burger with extra condiment choices. The who experience was underwhelming."}
{"text":"Love, love, love South St.! Their burgers are great, made with beef that is hormone & antibiotic free. They have a great selection of toppings that you won't find at any other burger joint - zesty ketchup, cajun onions, mango chutney, wasabi mayo... 

The fries, of course, are great considering South St. is part of the New York Fries group. The onion rings are made with red onions, which give them a different flavour from the norm."}
{"text":"Did not try to line up for the In-N-Out pop up burger downtown, instead went here to try their burger. I got the \"True North\" - cheddar cheese, bacon, maple infused onion, on whole wheat bun with the combo of NY fries and coke. The burger was juicy with the melted cheese and bacon, how can it not taste good. The fries are from NY fries so the standard good taste is there. The only complain was the fire alarm went while I was enjoying my meal so that was super annoying. It went on for the entire time I was there trying to finish my burger."}
{"text":"Come here a few times.  You can pick your own choices of what need to be in the burger.  The meat is average, not as good as Angus.  I don't think I find in other burger store condiment like Guacamole, wasabi mayo.  Each customer is given a round metal container rather than a normal tray.  If you want sautéed mushrooms, it needs to be charge for 50 cents for small and a dollar for large portion.  I still think that New York Fries by itself has fries better than offer in South St. even though they are from the same company."}
{"text":"Overpriced burgers, long waits, noisy atmosphere. The quality of the burgers does not reflect the selling price - not worth the money spent. The staff should be a bit faster in preparing the food. All in all OK, but not my fave."}
{"text":"This is how you do a burger, plenty of fresh toppings including 3 different kinds of relish)(dill pickle, sweet and hot pepper) mustards (dijon, honey and regular) as well as the usual toppings tomatoes, romaine lettuce, cucumber and free guacamole. Their burgers are cooked to order unlike McDonald's and the cheaper fast food chains."}
{"text":"I love the sauces and topping options at this place. I always get the veggie burger with pepper jack cheese, spicy ketchup and garlic mayo. Lots of excellent toppings to choose from as well, red onions, cajun onions, olives, pickles, hot peppers to name a few. One thing I don't like about this place is there always seems to be a long line so it's not a super quick option sometimes. They have delicious fries with really flavourful seasoning as well. The staff are sometimes super friendly,sometimes not as much, but the burgers are usually very tasty. I have been many times and plan to go many more times in the near future."}
{"text":"I normally do not like fast food burgers. But I tried the South St burger last week and it was very good. They cook the burger just when you order and you can see them grilling it. 
The person who prepared the sandwich was very attentive too. They had small burgers which was just the right size for me. I loved the burger and I am definitely eating there again."}
{"text":"The first time we ate here we waited so long for our food... while others that ordered after us were walking away with their order I asked the 17 year old full of attitude what happened to our order..they forgot about our order..anyways after waiting for sooooo long we got our meal and not even a sorry . They really didn't care. Today we tried to eat here again..thought give it a chance . My son was getting picky and wanted something quick. There was only one lady in line.  I waited about 6 minutes while the same lady ..the only person in line..was still ordering. 6 people stand behind the counter talking ,with one girl taking 45 minutes to take one order. We walked out.  The burgers are good but we will not go back"}
{"text":"Although I miss Lick's this place is very similar in food, prices and atmosphere.  I love their Vegetarian burger and their toppings.  It is reasonable priced compared to other fast food joints, such as HERO, and I find their food delicious."}
{"text":"Tried this New York Fries based chain out. Ordered a Burger combo. Fries were great as were the burger toppings. However the Burger itself was horribly charred and chewy with no residual flavour left inside. For a Burger joint, it was horrible. They need to induce some training for this kids grilling these Burger patties in the back."}
{"text":"Quite good for mall food. I wouldn't make a trip to come here specifically, but if I'm at Cross Iron Mills and need a meal... I would eat here or Thai Express. SSBC is over by Bass Pro Shops, just so you know. I do like that SSBC creates burgers grilled and fresh.. organic, etc. so it's worth a shot."}
{"text":"I came here for my first time on Friday evening, and it will definitely be my last.

I asked the lady at the till the size difference between the 4oz. and 6oz. patties trying to figure out which one would be the better size for my husband. Right in front of me she started complaining & making fun of me in regards to my question to one of her co-workers. I was furious. I placed my order and waited in line for my food. It was finally my turn; the other lady that helped me was miserable as well. I told her that I wanted my burgers with the ingredients listed on the menu.  She started slamming buns around, slapping the sauces on the buns, acting like a complete child. I waited about 10 minutes for my food and left.  

Not only is the food overprice, but isn't that good. You can get a better tasting burger at McDonalds.  The staff is also incredibly rude; reason enough for me to never return. I will never step foot in that restaurant ever again.  I suggest saving your money and going to Five Guys or fatburger."}
{"text":"First time here.   First hamburger in Canada since we arrived a few days ago.   And our verdict:

1. Pricey.  Paid Canadian $ 12.71 about ($10 US) for a quarter pounder with American cheese, regular fries, and Dasani bottled water.   

2.  Burger came out quick...likely it was pre-cooked.
3 out 5 stars.

3.  Fries came out a but greasy but with a good crisp.

4.  Service was great

Overall, Five guys beats this place with both hands tied together."}
{"text":"I checked out this new burger place since I got a combo coupon for being a BzzAgent.  You can compare it to Harvey's where you choose the toppings.  South St. Burger has a wide selection of toppings from chipotle bbq sauce, wasabi mayo and spicy ketchup.  I had a beef burger on whole wheat.  My fast food became not so fast when a person ahead of me had placed a group order for 13 burgers.  At least it gave me time to ponder over the toppings.  I had sweet relish, mango chutney, cajun onions, dijon mustard and lettuce, tomato and cucumbers on mine.  Finally the burger was ready - it was juicy and tasty and I liked the whole wheat bread option.

Besides the wide topping menu the company has eco friendly business practices.

As quoted from their site:
\"South St. Burger Co. has pioneered the notion of premium fast food, using real, fresh ingredients. Its hormone and antibiotic-free beef is purchased from local farms that practice conscientious and natural farming and is turned into fresh, 100 per cent beef patties. South St. Burger Co.'s commitment to operating conscientiously is not exclusive to its ingredient selection. Restaurants have reduced their heating requirements by more than 300 cubic metres of gas per month through grill hoods with high technology heat exchange ventilation systems. The restaurants also use air-cooled as opposed to water-cooled ice machines, and LED bulbs for 50 per cent of their lighting requirements, and  South St. Burger Co. has installed a solar-powered water heater and solar electric panel at two locations, with plans to add more.\""}
{"text":"Despite the confusing menu. The burgers are good. Fries even better. South Street Burger is New York Fries with a burger.
Pricey $$$!
Just another one of those joints built on the \"gourmet\" platform.
Unfortunately staff demeanor does not match the price point. This location could use a visit from corporate. Staff don't give  a sheet attitude is enough to drive away customers."}
{"text":"I've eaten at this location a couple of times in the past and always had a miserable experience with the manager. He either is on the phone and delays taking my order or he gets impatient if I take longer than a millisecond to decide either beef or chicken. Today I decided on a chocolate milkshake. The South Street location at Yonge and Broadway makes excellent chocolate shakes but unfortunately I was near this Avenue and Lawrence one. The manager made the worst chocolate shake I've ever had the misfortune of drinking. It was thin and wimpy and more like thickened chocolate milk than a shake. I wouldn't even categorize what this guy made as a shake. It would be insulting to rich, thick, ice cream filled milkshakes everywhere to call that sad plastic cup of thickened chocolate milk a shake. I'm done with this location. The manager is unpleasant and his staff have this fear filled look in their eyes like \"please don't judge me by this guy\". This place is worthless."}
{"text":"What a disaster!

I almost gave them 2 stars because they refunded my money but than couldn't justify it because the experience was so bad.

We ordered two burgers and two fries and an order of gravy.  It does take a bit to get your order from South St because it is higher quality than normal fast food.  Our order took about 15 minutes to be ready.  When they called us up, they had only made one order of fries.  Because they drop their fries into the fryer one order at a time, they had to drop a brand new batch down, meaning our order was now just sitting on the counter getting cold.  Once our second order of fries were ready, the staff member went to place it on the tray and knocked everything over (which is completely fine, things like this happen).  She stood their in shock, than quickly collected some of the fries off the counter, and put them back into the container, straightened up the gravy container (which spilled all over the tray), and pushed the tray towards me.  

I was now staring at a tray, covered in gravy, with one fry container half full, one 3/4 full, a half a container of gravy and two burgers with gravy on them.  Had she attempted to get a new tray, throw down some new fries, wipe off the burger wrappers etc. than I would have said accidents happen no big deal.  But because of the mess I was delivered, I asked to speak to the manager, who quickly threw her under the bus saying it was because she was new.

After chatting for 5 minutes, the manager did do the right thing and gave me my money back, but needless to say I did not anticipate spending over an hour at South St Burger that day.

The burgers are okay, the prices are WAY too high and the management needs to train their staff properly because this was not the employees fault as much as it was how she was(n't) trained."}
{"text":"This is a regular guilty pleasure of mine, mainly because it literally sits on the corner of the street I live on. Which makes avoiding eating here regularly VERY difficult.

It's a bit on the pricey side, but it's said to be better quality beef than your average McDonald's or Burger King (which I also frequent from time to time ... *hangs head slightly in shame*). it's just a nice alternative. Plus, I love the selection of toppings you can add to your burger.

I find service to be decent/average, and I don't wait too too long for my order. 

I really don't have any complaints."}
{"text":"First impressions are everything.

I walked in wondering what South St. could offer me that no other burger joint in Toronto could. In that spirit:

Counter Guy: \"Hi!\"
Me: \"Hi! A friend told me to try this place. What are you guys all about?\"
Counter Guy: \"We do burgers.\"
Me: \"I know. I read your sign.\" *
Counter Guy: We do beef, chicken and veggie burgers.\"

South St. is yet another entrant into the Toronto Patty Party, yet another hamburgerdasher offering a new twist on the same-old. If my first point of contact can't tell me why I should be dining there, then maybe I'm not missing anything. For a full account of my Counter Encounter and a deeper investigation of the South St. Niche, see the bottom of this review. I want to talk food first:

++ Food:

While not artfully assembled, the burger was tasty. I never realized until after I left how good the bun was. The patty was tasty, but its consistency and flavour reminded me of Harvey's to the point where I'm suspicious - are they affiliated?. I like Harvey's, but it's just Harvey's.

Toppings were fresh and tasty. I had run into some consternation at the topping bar while my burger was being dressed - the wide variety creates a path-dependency and with it a risk of painting oneself into a condiment corner via such a delicious-but-incompatible topping selection as wasabi mayo. I had my burger barista dole out the Dijon horseradish instead on the premise that it would play nice with the other toppings; my lettuce, tomato, cucumber and jalapenos appreciated the forethought.

Were this my restaurant, I'd offer more or different toppings. Also, I'd use spatulas for applying condiments instead of the kind of plastic knives that get busted out at a family barbeque.

I also had onion rings, which were delicious (though cold, as they were on my tray well before my burger was ready). They were made with red onions, and the batter had a nice half-crunch as well as a hint of rosemary. I want to have these again, but will insist on fresh, hot ones next time.  My iced tea sucked, thanks to a Pepsi contract. Lipton Brisk is terrible.

++ Décor

I like this place. Dark tile floor, crisp and clean interior and a host of seating options. I went for the counter-and-stool combo facing Yonge Street and enjoyed the view (the windows are actually sliding doors for the summer!), but they also have high tables in the middle of the restaurant and some really cool-looking circular booths with comfy-looking seats that would be neat for groups.

++ The Counter Encounter

I asked for a beef burger, at which point I was quizzed on my bun preference (white or whole wheat) and desire to add cheese or bacon. I was prompted for sides with \"Do you want fries or onion rings?\" They don't do frings (a half-and-half fries/rings medley popularized, incidentally, by Harvey's in the early 1990s).

Notwithstanding my obvious ignorance of the restaurant's offerings, I was then asked \"Do you want anything to drink?\"** I opted for iced tea.

The rest of the staff were great, totally down with the fact that I needed a moment to confront the vast choices I found myself presented with at the topping bar. Not that it's a big deal, but it reinforced my belief that the staff weren't up to speed on the restaurant's \"fancy toppings\" concept when they kept calling the aioli \"garlic mayo.\"

++ The South St. Niche (my take, from the website):

South St. Burger seeks to carve their niche in the fast-escalating urban burger battle by delivering a decent-quality patty, a smorgasbord of garnishes and condiments,*** and sides that come with the pedigree and parentage of the fast food industry's potato patriarch.

Spawned from New York Fries, South St. boasts of fries and onion rings second to none.  Their fries are the hand-cut, skin-on NYF originals; their rings are made from red onions and dipped in a uniquely seasoned batter.

Besides choosing one of two buns, three patties and four cheeses (including goat, my lacto friends!), you'll have your say on 9 veggies (including green and black olives, cucumber, red onion and jalapenos), six mustards and ketchups (including Dijon and Dijon Horseradish) and seven other spreads such as wasabi mayo, guacamole, mango chutney and aioli.

Milkshakes, I'm advised, are made from scratch with hand-scooped premium ice cream. I'd have tried one had it been suggested to me, and will try one next time for sure.

______________
* OK, I didn't actually say that. But I wanted to. Instead, I looked at Counter Guy until he provided a slightly more fulsome response.
** This would have been a great opportunity to upsell me on a milkshake with something like \"Our milkshakes are made from hand-scooped premium ice cream. Would you like to try one?\" or even \"Our milkshakes bring all the boys to the yard.\"
*** I submit that the difference between a garnish and a condiment is spreadability. You can't spread a garnish, but you can spread a condiment."}
{"text":"Decemburger Do-over?

The Yonge St. location didn't impress me a month and a half ago, and the Laird locatoin (the original) didn't impress me tonight.  I'm not saying the place sucks, just that it's nothing special.

I'm once again baffled by the topping selection.  There are some really cool options (wasabi mayo, guacamole, horseradish mayo), but it's difficult to find a set of two or three that go well together.  Today I had Jalapeno Monterey Jack, jalapenos, tomatoes, black olives and guacamole.  Quite good, though I overdid it a bit on the guac.  My bad.

Shari \"eternal optimist\" M was of the opinion that the bun was crusty on the outside, and soft on the iniside. My term for this was \"stale.\"   Patty was better than last time, and I was reminded that it's hormone, antibiotic and filler free - nothing like myself, but strangely enjoyable.  Last time it seemed like the burger had some weird filler or binding agent - I stand correcteed.

The onion rings are tasty, but lose their heat very quickly and are a bit too crispy/crunchy for my liking.  Still, everyone should try these once - they're made with red onions and I swear there's rosemary or something in the batter.

Tried the milkshake this time, too.  Not exciting.  Made from hand-scooped, premium icecream and frresh milk, but still tasted like chalky syrup.  Weird."}
{"text":"I generally love South St. Burger, but this location is the WORSE I've ever been to! I gave them 3 chances and every time 1. They get my order WRONG 2. Don't fix it and just say \"sorry\" 3. They are out of CALIFORNIA spice. REALLY?!? I love my NY fries, but without California spice it's just not the same. 4. Staff are unprofessional and unmotivated to work 5. The meat doesn't taste like the other locations at all! Makes me wonder if they are buying cheaper non-organic meat!"}
{"text":"1920s diner, they haven't heard of chicken garden salads. They had me order garden salad $5 and chicken burger/meat only for 7.50
15$ chicken salad
Even A&W offers a chicken salad at a 1/3 the price..."}
{"text":"Opening week I was anxious to try this place out after friends raved about South Street Burgers. Was impressed with the topping and spread options! I was on it dressing the burger like a kid in a candy store with eyes glaring at the endless possibilities. Let's just say the first experience was mediocre but I have myself to blame for my inability to dress a burger! Given numerous options other than the standard burger offerings, I butchered the good name of the beloved burger.

Fast forward to my most recent visit- I am happy to report the South Street and I connected on a whole other level. 

I decided to seek professional help and allow the South Street connoisseurs work their magic. I ordered the infamous Hawaiian burger- explosion of awesome flavours that I typically wouldn't handpick myself. Sandwiched in between a whole wheat bun selected by moi was ginger glazed pineapple, crispy bacon, wasabi mayo, lettuce, and hot pepper relish. An awesome subtle kick of heat but nothing you fellow Yelpers can't handle. 

A side of NY fries and it just can't get any better. I ordered a regular which I felt was small compared to other gourmet burger joints but this girl isn't complaining- less running for me. Found a few undercooked fries which I'll overlook. 

Service- was uber fast and friendly! I was asked if I wanted modifiers to my Hawaiian and indicated no at which point was offered up a seat to sit down while I waited for my order. No need to rest those legs- a minute later I was on my way out. 

Resto was squeaky clean and that darn burger won me over. 

For those wondering- avoid Big Smoke Burger (housed in the food court) unless you're craving a dry patty and burnt fries."}
{"text":"Came here with a Groupon voucher and ordered the cheeseburger (which was way overpriced normally). The woman making my burger was very dismissive and didn't even crack a smile when asking what I wanted on my burger. So, BOO to the service!

As for the burger itself, the patty was very dry. You'd need to add lots of condiments to the burger or else you'd be sipping on your drink with every bite. The bun was nice and soft - I liked that we're given the option of whole wheat or white bread. The onion rings on the side was pretty good as well and large in portion. 

Pricing - I would not pay over $10 for a burger. Hopefully, during my next visit the quality of the burger will improve, along with the service. 

Tip: Free Refills & Guacamole is a condiment option!"}
{"text":"South Street Burger is New York Fries' attempt to enter the burger market.  Most locations are in the burbs, I came across this location in Mississauga.  They have various sizes of burgers on their menu, regular or small, with the option to add more patties.

I got the small burger combo, which is a small burger, small fries and regular drink.  You have many toppings options, which is one of their marketing tactics.  I did not go over zealous with my toppings, standard fare (lettuce, tomato, pickle, mustard, ketchup) + garlic mayo.  The burger was smallish, the patty was tiny compared to the rest of my burger but I was hungry.  The fries unfortunately were not fresh, they were reheated back in the fryer but I did enjoy them, it is New York Fries after all.

I would compare this joint to a hero burger with better fries.  If there is one in our neck of the woods, check it out."}
{"text":"In the busy area of Yonge & Eglinton, South St. Burger is located on a busy intersection. We arrived just after 1pm on Saturday and the place was bustling.  They have your standard burgers, you can get a small or regular size burger.  Fries are New York Fries (yum!), small, medium & large.  They have oodles of toppings to choose from.  They even have milkshakes - mocha as a flavour!!

The burgers were delish and fries were perfectly done.  I love the california spice they offer.

Price wise, South St is a premium burger which is trying to compete with Smoke's, Hero and the others a like.

I really liked this location, there was ample seating to enjoy our meal.  

I will definitely be back for my burger fix."}
{"text":"Hot and fresh prepared burgers @ south Street 
I believe a few shops are coming soon to London 

I'm not sure if the South Street experience is much different or better than the many in the upscale  
Burger restaurants around like Works, burger priest and Burger burger , 
But quite acceptable 1st try st this location in Vaughan Mills 

My combo was Hawaiian 4oz with fries and coke for $14

Rustic urban decor and young friendly helpful staff"}
{"text":"I didn't like it as much today.  I swear they changed their recipe.  It wasn't the same as the first time I went.  And my fries were NOT freshly made."}
{"text":"This place shows a 2.5 stars, pretty low rated place but I'm giving it a 4 stars cause the burgers are great. Made fresh and the quality of the food is great. It does take time to get the order made, but it's not like a McDonalds burger so you can expect to wait. The price point is on the higher end, and the menu is a bit complicated when you're ordering for the first time. Customer service isn't the greatest, and if you're going to ask questions about how to order, just spend some time to read the menu."}
{"text":"Actually more like a 4.5, had the True North, an excellent little burger - opted for the 4oz, not disappointed- or hungry. Great flavours, you can taste the difference fresh makes - I'm not sure which restaurants tag line that is but it applies here 100%, nice ambiance in restaurant, great accompaniment to NYF."}
{"text":"I've been here a few times and was always impressed with the employees. Fast. Courteous. Friendly. But this week, when I arrived home to find that my wife's burger was not fully cooked, I drove back to get another - hoping, of course that she would not get sick from what she had already eaten. When I talked to the manager I was expecting an apology for the both the inconvenience and the potential health risk but instead, he just grabbed the burger, said he needed to see it, and ushered me along, in line so I could get my replacement. No refund. No compensation of any kind. And worst of all, no words spoken at all. 

I don't expect a red carpet to be rolled out over something like this, but I at least expect an acknowledgement ( 3 words would do) of what has transpired.

Mistakes happen. But what started as a problem with my burger ended up being an issue with common decency. Needless to say, I won't spending my money here anymore."}
{"text":"This was my first time visiting any of the South St. Burger locations, and I was very impressed. The service was quick and friendly, and the food was great!! I had a 6oz burger with cheddar, and my friend got a \"True North\", which he swears by. He says he gets it every single time he goes to a South St. because he loves it that much! I thought my burger was very good. Cooked perfectly and so juicy! We also split a NY Fries together - always delicious. And just to make it a perfect meal, we each had a beer :-) Everything was perfect, although the price is a little on the high side, but I guess you get what you pay for, and I'd have to say it was worth it. The coupon we had also helped... Lol. I will definitely be visiting again!"}
{"text":"Went on my lunch. The burger is nothing special. The onion rings are meh. For $11. I could of got three meals at work. 

I might go back. But I was not blown away. However they do have NY fries. 

Overall It's over priced."}
{"text":"I like to be able to choose my own toppings. They have toppings such as gourmet relish, mango chutney, garlic aioli, guacamole etc. The burgers themselves are charbroiled, and the fries are the same as you would get from NY fries.(must be owned by the same company). 
I really just wanted to add, that while out the other day I noticed a new location opening up at South Trail Crossing. Its in a little strip, located in between the Walmart and Safeway. To be more specific, its next door to the Marks where there use to be a children's clothing store and a Dollar store. (now closed).
Now I won't have to drive to Balzac (Cross Iron Mills) to get a burger. This one's def. closer."}
{"text":"This place is a part of a chain that is popping up all over Toronto.  Overall the burgers are good, I like that it is licensed and the poutine is great.  There are a few downsides:

The place is lit like a Harvey's.  There is a really cool south street on King east that has a much nicer feel that they should try to do work on.  This one feels like you are getting interrogated the lights are so bright.

The price is quite high.  Once again that wouldn't be a huge issue if it didn't feel like you were at a cheap chain.  Who knows might even get a beer if I didn't feel like I was eating in a WalMart.

Overall the burger is good but the atmosphere lacking."}
{"text":"This burger place in CrossIron Mills was delish! 
They had a variety of toppings including goat cheese, blue cheese, guacamole, wasabi mayo... You can also get those toppings on the side to dip with your fries! 

We got the family combo with fries and onion rings. Those were very good because they were made by New York Fries. The family combo consisted of 2 little burgers and 2 regular burgers, it was split between three of us and there was still a little burger to spare so it was pretty filling!"}
{"text":"Comparing South Street Burgers versus Five Guys and Hero Burger, South Street wins hands down.

Why South Street is better than Five Guys and Hero Burger:

1) They offer whole wheat buns
2) Service is fast, but not so fast that your burger is mass produced
3) New York Fries and Poutine Offerings
4) Tons of fresh topping choices
5) Juicy made to order burgers

This one has plenty of parking, and no matter how busy it gets, the line up moves well."}
{"text":"I'm a big burger guy and haven't scratched a South Street off my list so decided to make time to try it out since there are quite a few of them in the city.  Nice, clean atmosphere but the product was at the same level as Hero Burger, maybe a tad better.  The meat tasted decently lean and you have the option for a whole wheat bun which was interesting.  They also have a tonne of toppings so you can really customize something to your palate.  It wasn't terrible a burger but it wasn't that big, juicy, greasy type of burger that just hits the spot.  It's a nice option to have around but I can't report anything at a 'must try' level here."}
{"text":"My burger was very overcooked. Girl working there hardly put any ketchup on. Fries were alright. Lots of annoying families with little kids making a ton of noise smh. Very expensive for the quality you get too. Paid 12 bucks for the burger, fries and a root beer. 2 stars"}
{"text":"The staff are friendly.
The burgers are made fresh are the sides.
It's a nice gourmet burger joint & the price reflects it."}
{"text":"Ordered a 8 oz beef burger with mango chutney, guacamole, and salsa. Great meat quality, prices are quite reasonable, but what makes this burger joint great are the sauces. I used to regularly visit Harveys maybe 5 - 7 years back, but the last time I went I paid nearly $7 for a burger that looked and tasted like the then-$1.39 McDouble @ McDonalds. Needless to say, I haven't stepped into Harveys since then. Anyways, the point is that I'm pleasantly surprised by the burgers here. They're juicy, grilled to perfection, and the sauces really take it up a level. 

Wait times aren't the best when there is a large crowd, but that's forgivable. The topping-deciding area is also oddly small (maybe 3 people at most) even though there is lots of counter space. On another note though, I really like how this place isn't in the food court, so its typically quite intimate/quiet."}
{"text":"South Street Burger a division of New York French Fries is pricey and in all honesty for a burger....  not worth it.  The staff is not very friendly and although it is very clean it is also very sterile.  Much rather have a whopper."}
{"text":"I thought this place would of been good.  Took my son here for a free burger which they advertise on a coupon that I received.  Unfortunately they didn't honour it, telling me that I had to sign up for the birthday club.  Anyways I ended up buying the burger and I got it on a gluten-free bun which cost a dollar more then the other buns. The bun was hard and the burger was burnt. It was the worst burger my son said he's ever had.  They were rude as well. Should've known something was wrong with the restaurant when you go there on a Friday afternoon and it's dead."}
{"text":"I'm visiting from California and have tasted quiet a bit of different burgers. By far, this has been one of the best burgers and fries that I have tasted. The entire staff are friendly and attentive to their customers needs and questions.
I will definitely come back for more before going back to the U.S.!"}
{"text":"I should have checked the reviews first. The service was very good, but the burger was not. I got a double 6oz patty with cheese and some fixings. The burger was overcooked, although the meat did taste quality. That bun sucked. The fries were mediocre at best, even though they were freshly made. The Coke Zero from the fountain was the best thing about the meal. It was a pretty bad value at just short of $20."}
{"text":"tasty burger with 4oz and 6 oz. true north is patty with bacon with Swiss chess. For 5.5+2.5.  Grab a  boylan soda for 2.5. Best when you are shopping n hungry"}
{"text":"Came here during the week for lunch and it wasn't busy.

Pros:
- Decent quality food.

Cons:
- Pricey for the quantity offered"}
{"text":"So.  Good.  Just about the best burger I've had, aside from my own home-made ones.  I don't think there's much more I can add that hasn't been said already.  But for you vegetarians there is a veggie burger, which is also quite good (according to my veggie friend).  So go and have a great burger, done just right, with all kinds of toppings and condiments.  Yum."}
{"text":"Nothing special here. Not sure what all the hype is about. Burger was average but they have some cool toppings. I will go to Harvey's next time. NY fries were good but I can get that at the local mall."}
{"text":"One of the best burgers in town.
Looked around to sink my teeth into a decent burger after shopping at The Home Depot nearby. I've never eaten at South St Burger so I gave it a go.
Walked in. First impression? Clean. Spacious. I like it that way.
What to order? No problem. Menu easy to read. Staff are very helpful.
Wife ordered the 4oz. ($5.25). Made it into a \"True North\" Signature Choice (add $2.50)
I ordered the 6oz. ($6.95). I upgraded to the \"BBQ Bacon\" Signature Choice (add $2.50). I made mine into a combo only but swapped the soft drink into water (add $4.75++). You can order up the regular ingredients or pay a little extra for the premiums.
The burgers are firm and juicy. They have that bbq grill taste. It just needs that little extra smoke taste to make it complete. Fries are excellent. Not soggy or burnt. Just right.

I'll be back for sure.

{"text":"I just had a true North burger with bbq sauce instead of mayo (I'm allergic to eggs). I was so impressed that I was kinda shocked: fresh ingredients, real cheese, and well prepared. (Total cost would be about $10?)

This was topped off with friendly service and food delivered to our table in good time. 

I honestly hadn't considered south street burger as an option... now I have to reconsider! :)"}
{"text":"For this being the first burger we have eaten in Canada, it was alright. 

Customer service would need some improvement because most of the workers looked tired and it was like they didn't enjoy their jobs. This burger joint kinda reminded me of subway where you get to build what types of toppings go on the burger. 

I got the nacho burger and I thought melted cheese and home made guacamole was going to be on top but what I got was regular cheese and it felt like the guac was store bought. The burger was cooked perfectly and the place had the right amount of seating. I would come again if the service was a bit more friendly."}
{"text":"I visited South St Burger for lunch during a weekday afternoon. I was surprised that there was such a good burger place so close to my office and I had never been before. I feel like a lot of people know about this place yet so few people write reviews for it because its a hidden gem that they want to keep to themselves hahaha !

Judging by the crowd at lunch time, I'd say this is pretty highly rated in a lot of people's books.  Some of the main highlights from South St include:

1. The ability to customize your own burger as well as a few pre-made options available.

2. Over 20 free toppings to choose from including a variety of flavoured mayo, fresh veggies, a variety of relishes and even a few cool options such as mango chutney and maple glazed onions. There are also 10 or so premium toppings at an additional charge.

3. The fries are New York Fries! This also includes the classic NYF seasoning powders(California/Cajun etc.) that they have at normal NYF locations.

4. They give you an option to choose between white or whole wheat buns, something rare at burger places usually. 

Service was speedy and the dine-in facilities were clean with a lot of seating available for people who choose to stay. Will definitely return!"}
{"text":"Finally I have tried the burger at South St. Burger.  To be very honest, I think their burgers are okay.  I still like Five Guys Burgers more but that's just my personal preference.  They do offer brown buns, which makes it just a little bit less unhealthy.  They also have different types of cheeses, sauces, topping to choose from as well.  I am actually quite fond of their onion rings.  They are crunchy on the outside and onion-ly on the inside.  However, they are a bit too greasy though, but other than that, I give a thumb up for their onion rings!"}
{"text":"The quality of food is actually pretty good. So the $10 burgers after a couple toppings and taxes kind of makes sense (the gluten free buns are pretty fluffy). But I've gone less than half a dozen times, having a bad experience during most of them. 
Including once paying about $15 for a gluten free meal and walking away with only a burger. Granted I should of payed more attention but no fries in the bag and I was never handed a cup. 
Now my 4th time visiting and I'm eating a burger that's undercooked in the middle. I think it's the last one I'll be buying from this place. Only reason they didn't get 1 star is because their fries are still pretty great. But their prices aren't shy about it."}
{"text":"Like this place for burgers.
Tired of fast food greasy burgers like a&w and mcdonalds.
Well south st burger is complete diffrent. It may be expensive but it is way better. You can pick what you want on your burger like sauces toppings and bread. Their fries are pretty good also.
The wait time is pretty long, that is the only down side :( also the fries are good also

You should Check it out if you are a burger fan I really like this place!"}
{"text":"Straight up, I'm not a huge fan of this franchise, i found the burger quite bland, really lacking basics like salt and pepper,  the bun was very disappointing too, quite dry , the fries were just ok and the onion rings were not too bad, fresh made but they use a somewhat strange granular batter. 

I was really craving a burger today and sadly this was literally my only choice on new years eve where most places had closed early. Bottom line is I've had much better, and I've had a lot worse too.. Ultimately, i don't think I'd give this place my money again, as there's just so many other, and  MUCH, MUCH better options out there."}
{"text":"When it was suggested we try the new 'upscale-looking burger joint' in Crossiron I agreed - who doesn't love a good burger?  We decided to try it yesterday and I'm really not sure it's that much better than fast-food.  I saw the NYF logos and hesitated but thought I should at least give it a try.

I ordered the True North combo with onion rings and a pralines shake.

The milkshake: great flavour however it was either on the mixer too long or the balance of icecream to milk was way off because it was more like drinking melted icecream than a milkshake.  Thickness was just a little off milk and somewhat disappointing on size considering the cost.

The onion rings: cut too thin, and white or sweet onions would have been better - red onions don't deepfry so well with such a thin batter.  The batter itself was unseasoned, burnt, and so thin that the overcooking made it constantly crumble and fall off.  Difficult to eat and in the end I couldn't bring myself to eat the last ring.

The burger: good bun size but bland, needs lots of sauce and I only had two - the special sauce and bbq sauce (which I couldn't taste at all).  The patty was unseasoned and dry even if the size was good, so it had no flavour.  The vegetables were fresh but that's all you could taste - lettuce, tomato and pickles.  The sweet onions that went on it had no flavour, not even tasting like onions, which is odd.  The cheese was good - two pieces, and the bacon was done just right so at least that was good.

All in all it was more of a chore to eat than it was worth at $36 for two people, and I'll look elsewhere for a decent burger in Calgary."}
{"text":"I love this place and almost every time I pass by it I want to go in for a burger, a poutine and a praline milkshake (unfortunately no longer offered... almost broke my heart). Only issues I have is that the wait time is quite variable, be prepared to wait maybe 5-10 minutes for your food... And they need to bring back the praline milkshake."}
{"text":"This restaurant have my boyfriend the shits and made me throw up. Would not send my worst enemy there."}
{"text":"In my ongoing quest to complete \"Burgasm 2011\", next stop was South St. Burger Co. Could it compete with the toe-tingling likes of Stockyards, Super Burger and others?

First of all, great location. I was in the mood to people watch, and this was perfect. 

The service could have been a little better. They forgot to give me my drink, and almost gave me fries instead of onion rings, and it wasn't really busy at all. No matter, they quickly corrected themselves, and I was served. The price was decent.

The place itself is pretty standard fast-food fare. Clean, basic, no real flash whatsoever.

The onion rings were alright, I suppose. As far as the burgers go, it's worth noting that if you're a topping-fanatic, this place is that hazy place that you keep forgetting the name of in your wet dreams. They have everything you could want, and the kitchen sink. Seriously, among the toppings, they have \"-Kitchen Sink\" listed. Ok maybe not, but it felt that way. Oh, South St, you can tempt me with your erotic toppings, but it's the burger itself I'm interested in. 

This burger definitely holds its own among the heavy hitters I've had this year. Simply delicious. The meat was quality, it was perfectly cooked to melt-in-your-mouth bur-fection, the buns were fresh, and it was greasy as hell (compliment!). I really have no complaints whatsoever with this burger.

This SO isn't over. I know there's a better burger out there, but I can lay my head to pillow every night, knowing there are sweethearts like this one out there. It will happen. Total burgasmic delight shall be mine!"}
{"text":"Have driven by this location quite a few times, and since I was finally in the area, decided to pay it a visit.

Everything at South St. is pretty delicious. Their burgers are all freshly grilled and a nice inclusion is that they grill their hot dogs as well! Their fries were pretty good as well. One of my favourites is that they have bottled soda, which is always a plus for me!

Excellent service and lots of sitting room."}
{"text":"New York Fries has opened up a great burger place - the story goes they searched high and low for all the things that make a great burger - and I'd say they did a great job.  The buns and burgers are really good, but its  the condiments that really make it for me - my favorite is the spicy ketchup and honey mustard.  Its a little expensive, but probably no more so than any of the competitors in this space.  Yummy, and the fries are of course pretty good!"}
{"text":"Went here to try out their veggie burger. While waiting for my order, there was a photo on the wall of a burger made entirely of peas that claimed to be the veggie burger. Thankfully, that was not the case! The burger wasn't bad, albeit a little on the dry side. I liked the pickles they used. 

The accompanying fries were done perfectly and the order was huge, despite being part of the combo. I shudder to think of who could possibly finish the large order of fries. As much as I enjoyed them, I had to pass them on to my friends who were more than willing to help me out."}
{"text":"3.5 stars.

I have been there 3 times now cause we bought a few vouchers.

Each time I had a burger with Swiss cheese, lettuce, tomato, onions, mayo/ketchup as well as fries on the side.
Once I also had a coffee.

The burger is not bad - if you tell them to grill the patty until well done.
The first 2 times I got their default version which is medium-rare and it was just lacking a lot of flavor.
Finally the last time I ordered it well done and it was so much better!

They get a few points for the variety of their toppings.
I prefer the standard cheeseburger, but for those who like it a bit special this will be a plus for sure.

The fries are great. They are New York Fries.. Do I need to say more?

Their coffee on the other hand totally sucks. 
I got stomach cramps half way through the cup. Definitely not recommended. Stick with water."}
{"text":"Disapointing. Chewy meat.  I expected tender juicy burgers. I come
From Quebec and I was excited about a burger with prime Alberta meat. 

What a let down.  Help yourself and go to Smash burger, fatburger or fice guys. They know what real non chewy meat is..."}
{"text":"I like south street more than gourmet burger just because the service is always great and there's more seating. As for gourmet there's sitting for a bout a space of a closet. I like that they have small burgers just in case if your not that hungry. They have milkshakes which are great. The only bad thing is the wait line around lunch time. It's pretty long but besides that the burger taste great!"}
{"text":"So yummy! A step up from fast food. Love choosing all my toppings and sauces. I'm  vegetarian, but didn't feel like a veggie patty so I got the bun with mushrooms and all the toppings. They discount the price when taking off the patty (which isn't always a given at every place) so I had a very affordable burger! (Or non burger) hubby had the veggie burger and fries (can't go wrong with New York Fries) which we shared. Both of us enjoyed a lot!"}
{"text":"oh wow....I am so renaming Decemburger to Fat Bastard Month

Just got home from an impromptu burger with Dale \"on vacation\" M.  I now feel so bloated, I don't want another burger for a while.  Thankfully it is almost the end of the month.  I think I will be going burger free for a while.

Tonight's burger was good.  Opted for onion rings, good choice.  Red onion - a nice switch up.  Not too greasy, and not a slimy onion in sight.

I feel a burger coma setting in....oh no....here come the meat sweats...."}
{"text":"Was visiting from NYC -- easily the best Fast[ish] food burger I have EVER had!
Onion Rings were ridonculous!
LOVE this joint!"}
{"text":"Very good. Too bad the staff sucks. Watch your burger down the line. They tend to mix it up."}
{"text":"This burger joint is brought by the same guys of NY Fries... so right from the first moment, you know you will be receiving a great side with your order.
Place is clean, and staff is friendly, but it feel like it moves a bit slow just because they actually only put on the grill the patty as soon as it it ordered... which is great, because you know you're getting something fresh, and not something that has been on the grill for hours.
Tip: Guacamole is a standard topping, and free of charge for a single serving... you don't see that often!"}
{"text":"I don't proclaim to be a burger connoisseur but I have been known to go out and seek good burger joints. I first saw South St. Burgers when Cross Iron Mills first opened. I had always wanted to check it out but never had a chance until tonight.

South St. Burger is a subsidiary of New York Fries, in fact they server NYF as their fries when you order a combo. But, I'm not here to talk about the fries, let's get down to the burger!

I had a normal hamburger on a whole wheat bun. I think that the bun really made the burger. The patty was good, but the bread was really delicious. I was amazed at the amount of customization that they offered (very reminiscent of Harvey's), a variety of different sauces you can put on and many different veggies. I would definitely recommend the garlic mayo!

The only thing stopping me from giving 5 stars is the service. Now when I go to a burger joint I don't expect top notch service like I would at a Four Seasons hotel. But, I am dropping $9 on a burger, the least the staff could do is smile and let me know to take my tray down to the customization area. The staff merely tossed the metal pan on top of the glass cabinet and walked away. No mention to me that I need to slide down or anything, not only that, they forgot my drink. I had to line up all over again just to get my drink because I didn't want to cut in line."}
{"text":"We went here to give this place a try after hearing so many good things about it.
However their reputation seems to be a bit of hype.
Dont get me wront, it was good, or at least decent but not spectacular so maybe i was there at the wrong time or something like that.
I found that the toppings were fresh and the service was good, but some how it just didnt add up for me.  I've had better.
I have nothing bad to say.  It was ok but thats all it was.  Another designer burger place in my opinion, but it just didnt quite hit the wow factor of burgers"}
{"text":"The True North Burger. Double cheddar, double bacon, 4 oz naturally raised beef patty, maple syrup infused onions. How about a tiny tasteless patty topped with almost invisible and totally tasteless bacon and a tiny little bit of onion without a hint of maple? The 5oz burger I had at A&W last week was almost twice the size (how do you manage that with 1oz size difference?)and definitely better tasting, and for less! Never again will I waste a meal on this poor excuse for a gourmet burger place!"}
{"text":"The cashiers here are sooo bad. They had a promo discount for their True North burger advertised right on their cashier screens. After I paid, I noticed I was charged full price. When I told the cashier 1 second after, she literally said \"Oh, it's your job to tell me. Can't change it now\" ARE YOU JOKING? She blamed me for not knowing how to do her job.

Another time the sodas were all flat. I tried different drinks but it was again all flat. I asked if I could pay extra for a bottled drink, the cashier said no because she didn't know how to do that......

Another time I was eating there well before closing time, and I had some fries left. The worker asked me if I was done, before I could answer took away my tray....."}
{"text":"Burgers a just okay but love the unique toppings. I come for the fries and gravy - takes me back to high school and hanging out at the mall. Don't forget to order your gravy."}
{"text":"Might as well go to Burger King and pay less. $15 for two burgers, no sides like fries, one small watered down soft drink (which tasted weird). Had to order a side of fries as an extra. Burger was nothing special, small for the price. Skip this place."}
{"text":"I have been to this location a couple times in the past two years and finally decided to go back last Sunday. As I walk in, we were invited by the mouth watering burger scent with a lovely employee at cash taking down our orders.

We decided to go with the regular burger with a side of large onion rings and a bacon cheese burger with pulled pork poutine. The wait was manageable and it took I'd say less than 10 minutes to cook our food. On the regular burger, I asked for all my favourite toppings which includes, wasabi mayo, lettuce, two slices of pickles, honey mustard, bbq sauce, and guacamole. On the bacon cheese burger, we asked for every topping possible - sounds gross but it was de-lish! 

Surprisingly, with all the toppings that we ordered, the sesame buns were not soggy nor were they moist with all the sauce. I absolutely enjoyed the pulled pork poutine and the crispy lightly breaded fresh onion rings were not bad either. 

As we finished all our food, we decided to grab two waffle cones for dessert - strawberry and pralines and cream. They were delicious. Need I say more?

Overall, as a incredibly picky eater especially when it comes down to burgers - South St. Burger Markham is not too shabby. The cashier was helpful and very kind so were the staffs that worked last Sunday night. I definitely do not mind blowing $30 on burgers and ice cream waffle cones here!"}
{"text":"OK... so much potential, so little delivered.

I wouldn't have stopped here under normal circumstances.  It's the burger outlet of New York Fires aka NYF, which has no affiliation with NY, NY, not actually a city or state known for it's french fries, so that might be good after all.  I find NYF's fries an unmitigated disaster.  They might be hand-cut, but then they're routinely destroyed by hand too, by a cheap single fry that's often underdone and greasy or overcooked and dry.  Not to mention what they call poutine!  No wonder the Francophones want to leave the country.

I stopped because they flame broil their burgers!  The best burger is a flame broiled burger!  How bad could it be if they flame broil?   I should have known that an internal dialogue like this was not going to lead to a brilliant decision.

First, it's really a tarted up Harvey's process.  You order your patty and cheese/bacon option, and then you're given a round tray (reminded me a little of a large dog dish) which you drag down the counter past a toppings bar where another server assembles the burger to your order.  

A couple of things... 

Harvey's has the good sense to not top your burger until there's a patty to dress.  It makes more sense that way.  The burger is there, I make my decisions, the focus is on the burger and it's wrapped once dressed and I take it away.

Here, they dress your bun. Admittedly, you have a choice of bun: white, whole wheat, even gluten-free, but it's a guy reaching into a plastic bag and dragging out a bun.  A bun that they do not toast...  Your bread is then paraded down the cold table and they dress it... then you wait... and you wait... and you wait, as they apparently flame broil your patty.  More on that later too...  In my case, I was invited to sit down and have the finished burger brought to me.  All in all, it was very anticlimactic.  I could have just told the guy at the cashpoint what I wanted on it, some guy in the back could have dressed the bun in the back, and I could have been sitting the whole time.

Now here is where the paradoxes start.  They have a lot of great toppings and condiments, you can have Chevre, but they use them like everything is in very very short supply: a leaf or two of lettuce, a slice of tomato, a dollop of ketchup or mustard, a smear of guacamole (since when is a green smudge a serving of guacamole?), a soupcon of peppers.  The stiff is fresh and looks good, can I have some please?  Now, remember that this is all happening on just a bun, the meat, the star of the show... it's still flame broiling... more on that later.  I asked for Dijon horseradish mayo... I could taste neither the tart winey region of France or the spicy root so favoured by the English.

Because it was getting awkward for all of us to be standing around a bun with a few leaves of lettuce on it and a few smudges of sauce, I was told that my meal would be brought to me, and it was... by a very friendly young man.  He exchanged my empty dog bowl for one with my burger and side of onion rings in it (more on the onion rings later).  And again, the paradoxes continued.  The patty looked thick and juicy!  Oh my!  I took one bite and realised... (1) it was obviously machine formed, upscale burgers are not machine formed - it's just not right, and (2) it was so slowly flame broiled that it had none of the caramelisation that you look for when flame broiling.

A quick aside, a flame broiled burger is usually better than a flattop fried burger because it develops that caramelised crust that makes it so good!  You know, the kind you get in the backyard when you're distracted by conversation and beer, or on an open campfire, because you can't control the heat.  In-n-Out is about the only burger chain that manages it, and they do it on a flattop.  These guys have flames!  I saw them!  But the burger had none of the contrast in texture or bits like the yummy ends of a good roast that's supposed to come with flame broiling!  It was cooked. It was acceptable.  Was it premium hamburger like the price implies? Heck no!

Then there were those onion rings... I give up!  Apparently, NYF, a company that fries things to make money is incapable of frying anything.  After learning that they can't do fries, I've discovered that their fryers are the WMD of all food.  My onion rings came the colour of Italian roast coffee, rings that dried out my mouth and destroyed any sense of taste I might have been left.  Even after over-frying, they managed to leave a noticeable slick of oil in the bottom of the container.  I know it's not health food, but it shouldn't be the Exxon Valdez either.  The pity is that the batter seemed to be this crispy tempura that if fried hot and fast, would have probably knocked my socks off!

Unfortunately, the South St Burger Co. is very much like it's decor... a lot of veneer and not much substance.  I will say that my Lipton Green Ice Tea was exactly how I expected it to be though, so kudos on that!"}
{"text":"I tried them all, this place, hero burgers, priest burger. This place is alright but just doesn't have the flavor out of all the flavor of regular places. Although they have good toppings"}
{"text":"I tried this place twice before and did not enjoy the food and wanted to give them one more shot since I got a buy one get one free burger coupon.

Got a 6oz mushroom melt combo with large fries and total after tax was $18! Way over priced and the meat was dry and lacked flavor. As for the free burger I got the turkey and it was a bit dry as well. The only thing good they have going for them is their fries, but other than that I would avoid."}
{"text":"Food: 3.5/5
Atmosphere: 3.5/5
Service: 4/5
Overall experience: 3.5/5

(1- Terrible; 3- decent; 5- Fantastic)

I have passed by here so many times in Cross Irons and i finally decided to try it last week. Although it is kind of pricey for a burger, everything is made to order and fresh (100% beef patties) and you have an awesome selection of gourmet toppings. My bf and I got a regular hamburger for $5.45 and a combo with a drink and fries for $9.00. They also have a choice of veggie burger and grilled chicken. Addition of cheese (choice of goat cheese, blue cheese, swiss, cheddar or pepper jack) and bacon is $1.00. It was also nice to see homemade milkshakes (about $4 -$5) and onion rings on the menu.

After ordering your burger, an assembly line of workers added whatever toppings you want with a choice of whole wheat or white bun. There are several varieties of ketchup (spicy or regular), mustard (Dijon, Dijon horseradish or regular), mayonnaise (garlic, wasabi or curry) and relish (gourmet, hot pepper, sweet or mango chutney), and the usual veggies of pickles, lettuce, tomatoes, cucumbers, olives, hot peppers, onions and guacamole.

The hamburgers were about twice the size of A&W hamburgers and fairly decent; super fresh, but was slightly disappointed in how it was a tad dry.

It can get quite busy here, but the service is fair. Cashier rang us up quickly and you're looking at about 10-15 minute wait depending on how many people are in front of you. The decor is reminiscent of a modern New York eatery with orange, black, white accents (then again it is derived from New York Fries). Kind of your upscale fast food joint with flare.

Overall, if you're hankering for a burger while shopping and willing to spend a couple extra bucks, come here for a nice home made burger instead of the ones at fast food chains. Definitely worth a try but it's not on my high priority list of burger joints to eat at."}
{"text":"I've been here a couple times, usually because I'm in the area and need something or I'm wasting a bit of time before a movie and want something to eat. 

There's just nothing here to get excited about. The prices are maybe a little higher than what they should be. The burgers are fine I guess. But there's no \"wow\" factor. It's like how you go back to a burger place because there's just something there that brings you back time and time again. Maybe the way they cook it. Or maybe it's the toppings. Or maybe it's fries. And maybe it's how it all comes together into a glorious whole. I just don't get that here. It's been a largely forgettable experience every single time. 

Service is okay I guess. It's a fast food burger place and I'm not really looking for super happy and friendly burger people. They do their job, I get my food and it's fine. There is a bit of a delay though, I get that, you can't always get your food right away. 

But all in all I just can't muster any kind of happiness or satisfaction for this place. It's literally to the point where if I am in the area and need something I look for something else even if it means driving a little bit further."}
{"text":"Meh. I have had a few burgers from here, and while they aren't bad, they just aren't all that great. The choices are solid, but the ingredients seem pretty average to below average in quality. If you are dying for a quick burger, it is worth a stop but not a destination."}
{"text":"They messed up my order (Hawaiian burger) and, when, I received it, all I could taste was the onions and the mayo. Bravo. Stick with Union Burger nearby, or just a homemade burger altogether."}
{"text":"Given the build up, I was disappointed in this restaurant.  Yes the burgers are nicer than the standard burger joints, but not that much better.  

I found the staff indifferent, disorganized, and did not make me feel I was in a premium fast food establishment.   In one word I would say: underwhelming.  


Suggestions to management: get your staff motivated, and get organized otherwise you will lose repeat customers.

{"text":"I was craving New York fries and decided to stop by South St instead of an actual New York fries location because they advertise they serve the same fries.  The store was empty at 530pm on a Saturday ( not a good sign).  My fries were up in a few minutes and I took them to go. New York fries are pretty consistent from location to location but these were way off the mark.  They potatoes used were old and dry which produced a equally dry, hard, flavorless fry.  They were really greasy too as the person making them I noticed was to lazy to shake the excess oil off of them as they came out the fryer.  Based on my experience with the fries I won't waste my time coming back to try any of their burgers."}
{"text":"This is a New York Fries owned franchise restaurant situated beside the Bass Pro Shops Outdoor World.  The Burger place is very inviting and you can smell the grilling of the burger as you walk in.  I had the regular burger and fries combo.  I was really surprised how delicious the burger was.  The 1/3 lb burgers are made with fresh patties and 100 per cent pure, hormone and antibiotic-free, naturally raised beef from the Calgary area (Spring Creek Ranch), as their website says.  The burger was so good, I felt like I could easily eat another one, but I was quite full from the one burger.  You have a choice of adding any ingredients and condimentsto your burger.  It's reasonably priced, starting around $9.

 It beats waiting in the long lines at and sitting with the large noisy crowds at the food court.

I would recommend anyone to try it when they visit the CrossIron Mall."}
{"text":"I didn't realize this location was so close to my doctor's so after my check-up, I stopped in for a bite. I was surprised at the various topping choices. They have everything from spicy ketchup to garlic mayo to mango chutney. I took Natasha E's advice and didn't load up on too many toppings.

I have to commend the wait staff. There was a girl in front of me who modified her order 9 times and their patience and smiles never wore off. I would've thrown her burger at her a long time ago!

The burger was really good. It was juicy and flavourful. I was sad when the eating experience ended and wanted to order another one. But it would've messed with my daily calorie intake. At least there's tomorrow."}
{"text":"I just went to South St. Burger Co. for the first time (in Ajax), & thought I'd share.  It's a slightly more upscale burger joint with nicer decor & ambiance than your average burger shack.  They do a few things to help separate them from other places, & give them a different identity.  Their prices are a bit higher than standard fast food places, more like Lick's or Five Guys Burgers & Fries.  For this review, I'll be comparing South St. head-to-head vs Five Guys.

First, I'll start with the atmosphere, since it's one of the first things you notice when you walk in.  South St has nicer decor, furniture, & ambiance.  Like I said before, it feels more like a restaurant than Five Guys, which definitely has more of a fast-food feel to it.  When you're going out for a burger, you don't need anything fancy, but sometimes it's nice to sit at a table & not feel like you're sitting down to quickly wolf down your meal.  The food isn't served on standard plastic meal trays, but in aluminum pie pans, which is different.  Their tray liners are circular to fit the pie pans, & it's a neat idea that I'd never seen before.  South St definitely wins in this category.

Next, I'll move on to the most important category & talk about the burgers.  South St. gives you the option of a white or whole grain kaiser, which is a nice choice to have, & not one offered at many burger joints.  The buns are done by a local bakery, & mine was nice & fresh.  They use hormone & antibiotic-free beef, while Five Guys website just states that they use \"fresh ground beef\" & that nothing is ever frozen.  South St gives you one large patty on their standard burger, whereas Five Guys gives you two smaller patties.  South St burgers are flame-grilled, compared to Five Guys & their flattop.  I prefer the flame-grilled taste, & the larger patty, so I've got to go with South St.  Their burger was cooked perfectly, & was very juicy.  Five Guys burgers were good too, but I have to side with South St on this one, although that's just my personal preference.  Another reason I think they're better is that they offer a wider array of toppings & sauces, as well as five different kinds of cheese to choose from.  They offer four different types of mustard, two kinds of ketchup, four relishes, three different mayos & three kinds of sauces to enhance & personalize your burger.  A tidbit on Five Guys' website states that there are over 250,000 possible ways to order a burger at Five Guys, & because I suck at math, I can only guess that means there's over 1,000,000 different ways to order at South St.  Another important factor to consider is price, & whereas Five Guys will charge you $6.49 for a regular burger, South St's price is only $5.75, & you get a $1.00 discount if you buy a combo, unlike Five Guys.

Next is the battle of the fries, which some people would argue is as important as the burgers.  South St uses New York Fries, whereas Five Guys uses freshly cut, homemade fries.  Even though South St's website states that their NYF are hand-cut daily from fresh potatoes as well, the edge here goes to Five Guys.  Their fries are better than some chip trucks I've been to, & the portion is massive.  Two people can easily split an order of their fries, & even though a regular order of fries is $1.00 more than South St, it's well worth the extra dollar.  The NYF portion is standard & I just didn't enjoy their fries as much.  Even though they have several different seasonings to use on the fries, Five Guys have got them beat here.

Miscellaneous factors, Five Guys offers free refills, & while South St might offer them too (I don't know), you'd have to go back up to the counter to get it, which is a pain, particularly if you're there at a busy time.  It's nicer when you can just go refill your own cup, so Five Guys gets another nod here.  The free peanuts offered by Five Guys surely appeal to some, but I doubt anyone goes there specifically for that reason.  Besides, those peanuts are so incredibly over-salted, that you should be entitled to those free refills by law.  One other small thing that South St does better than Five Guys is their website.  Their menu actually has prices on it, so you can see for yourself what things will cost, & you're not soiling your pants when you find out your total.  Also, South St uses local businesses for supplies & lists many different ways that they \"go green\" whenever possible.  Some people might not care, but I think it's nice to see a business with a conscience.

So after all that, I've got to give the edge to South St. Burger Co. over Five Guys Burgers & Fries.  Aside from the flame-grilled burgers & wide array of toppings & sauces, they were a slightly better value, they did more of the \"little things\" right, which is why I gave them three stars to Five Guys' two.  I'm still waiting for Big Boy's Burgers to open in Whitby, & I'll be sure to post on them ASAP.  In the spirit of Christmas, Season's Eatings, everyone!"}
{"text":"When I worked at CIM (for 3 years 2013-2016) this was it, this was the place, got me all hot and bothered. LOVED IT. Still do
I am writing this review now cause another south street broke my heart. So now I gotta make sure people know that this south street will put \"lead in your pencil\", \"Oak in your forest\", \"Iron in your mines\", \"Steel in your skillet\"

I forgot where I was going with this, but I do really like these burgers"}
{"text":"I am dropping my second 1star review here. I would like to stress how much I DO NOT like leaving negative reviews. BUT THIS IS HAPPENING
I would like to start off by saying the South Street burger in CIM is amazing, they are so good, that when I used to work in the mall I wouldnt order burgers when I went out for dinner with my girlfriend and other people, cause it wouldnt measure up to the South Street burger I would get at CIM. So you understand my sadness here
OK so the shake was thin, not flavourful and foamy, and weirdly warm. The fries where soft and not even a little crispy or salty, and the burger was a little undercooked and they gave it to a guy who ordered 4 burgers after me so I had to wait again. Now I can forgive many things, but I stack that all with when I complained I was told:
-Sorry the freezer has been on the fritz (ok great that would have been good to know BEFORE i ordered 2 shakes)
-Sorry the guy making fries is newer (Alright thats ok, get him to try again)
- Oh sorry we didnt mean to (of course you didnt Im not daft)

But there was 0 attempt to make it up to me, just a shrug and a week sorry.
You have ruined my love affair with South Street"}
{"text":"Like Amanda B, I don't understand the negative reviews here. 

I would say this place is better than Big Smoke and Union Burger and probably the best burger in the Square One area.  

Ambiance:  3.5/5 -  I felt fairly hip here.  It was fairly trendy. There were also plenty of tables and seats for people to sit at.  

Service: 4/5 I like the setup.  It was simple. So many of these burger places, you have to do a circle to order (go to the end of the line, come out to the front, and wait for food).  Here you just come in, order at the first cash you see, and then just wait for the burger.  I think the burger and fries took like 5 minutes to make.  Pretty cool.  Also, free pop refills (though I really don't like pop).

Food/price: 3.5/5  It was about $12 for 6 oz Hawaiian burger,small NY fries and a pop.  The beef in the patty tasted like quality meat, but I really loved the cooked pineapple on top.  While it's pricey, I like the option of getting it on a whole wheat bun.  

Verdict: If you want a burger in Square One, go here not Big Smoke."}
{"text":"Just a few steps north of Yonge and Eglinton and my work place is this burger joint. It's a modern Harvey's build-your-own burger place that serves NY fries and premium toppings.

For $8.99, you get a typical combo with the aforementioned NY fries, Pop, and choice of toppings. Most memorable are the guac, cajun onions, mango chutney, garlic mayo, dijon mustard, and spicy ketchup. Nothing mind blowing as you can see, but a nice difference to the regular.

The burger is good. Not dry and beefy. It's not a large burger either, I felt like the sides were a bit on the smaller side as well. 

Overall, it's different but not as great as a smoke's burger, burgers priest, Chuck's burger, or even a lick's burger. The NY fries are a good accompaniment and make the combo a better value for the buck."}
{"text":"I don't know what it is about burgers that draws me in, but I find them addictively delicious!
After eating so many you learn to really appreciate a good burger. I believe South St. Burger serves good burgers. They are very good quality meat and they offer a selection of toppings and garnishes that really bring the experience up a few notches.

I had the 4oz TRUE NORTH burger from their signature burgers selection and I was very impressed. The maple glazed onions were an excellent addition to the burger and really made a huge difference for me. The secret sauce resembles the mac sauce. They aren't stingy on bacon (always a plus in my book) and the cheese is REAL CANADIAN CHEDDAR- not the typical sliced american you get on a burger. I realize for some people they might read this and think, so what...but I am a cheese fanatic and real cheese has a different taste!

I opted for the $1.00 gluten free bread and it was really dry in comparison to the one I had at Holy Chuck's. But still I'm very happy they have the option available, especially since so many people suffering from intolerance etc. can't enjoy a simple burger because of it.

They are owned by NEW YORK FRIES and offer NYF as their side option. I upgraded to the Veggie Works. Think Taco Bell's Fries Supreme but with NYFs. (Thumbs up for taste, thumbs down for calories).
Overall a great experience and wonderful alternative to the mall's food court options because let's face it sometimes when you go out you just want to stuff your face with a good burger.

Also- Guac is no extra charge. I asked for some on the side to dip into.

4oz True North was about $7
6oz True North was about $9
Veggie works poutine was about $5

total came to $27 (after tax)"}
{"text":"Different than a routine Burger shop... but being a 5-Guys regular, would give a pass!"}
{"text":"It's an OK burger place. The patty itself is very greasy and I could feel the grease on my lips after each bite. The girl was stingy with the sauce so my burger ended up on the dry side. Not much more to say other than it was a tad on the pricey side for what you received."}
{"text":"First time trying poutine, so I have nothing to compare t to. But it was really pretty good!"}
{"text":"Terrible uberEats delivery experience. Completely wrong order with dirt and mud on the order. I will be reporting this chain to the Canadian Food Inspection Agency because the food was clearly contaminated. I would avoid this chain if you are not a big fan of food poisoning. Their lack of product safety and quality is evident. This might be a one time occurrence but it should never happen period."}
{"text":"A brand spankin new spot not 5 minutes from where my Fiancee' lives. She took notice to it one day and decided we should give it a try. I'm glad we did, it has the feel of a Harveys' with how the prepare the burgers but their selections seem to be wider. The meat has a better flavor to it, and the fries are tasty.  Everything in the place is clean and shiny due to it only having been here for a few months. If you get the urge for a burger but don't want the standard you have been eating, give this place a shot. So far, the best burger I've had yet compared to Licks, Harveys, and Wimpy's diner."}
{"text":"The True North Burger brought me to tears, it was seriously THAT good. You can taste the quality of the meat. If you are a real burger lover, go here. Quality ingredients, well grilled meat. I had it on a gluten free bun. No regrets."}
{"text":"Kinda disappointed really...the GF bun I had was like sawdust ;(
And the burger itself not much better."}
{"text":"This burger is nothing special in taste. The only thing different is you can choose your own kind of bread toppings, fillings, and sauces. Affordable for a quick snack and its filling though its just a normal tasting burger."}
{"text":"Located inside the mall it has a neat look and attracts in customers. However as far as the burgers go, to me they aren't worth the price as the flavours aren't present. it's a branch of new york fries and they have tried to showcase their menu by adding in flavours from all over the world. however the patties like their fries lack flavour, the customer service at this particular location was okay, not bad, not great. 
Give it a try once, you might not complain but you prolly won't try it again."}
{"text":"I was told over and over again that the burgers here are amazing and that it was a must try.  Well you know me when someone tells me there is a good burger im there.  I gave it a try this past weekend and you know what I was not impressed.  To be honest I was quite disappointed.  I am not sure if it was because I had high expectations or just the sole fact that I have had some pretty good burgers in my day.  The burger patty was tasteless.  What made the burger was the toppings.  The burger let off so much juices that the bread became very soggy actually more like wet.  The fries were good but lets be honest I paid for the burger so id prefer a better burger and not so good fries.   I probably will not go out of my way to go here again."}
{"text":"I give this place a 2.5. There's certainly nothing wrong with the quality,  taste or portion of their burgers, but for the price, I'd much rather go to the Burger's Priest or something and get the same anount of food for the same price, but muuuuccchhh tastier. 

The poutine I got tasted like they made the gravy using the powder packets you can get at any grocery store....and the cheese curds simply didnt melt. 

The burger was just ok, nothing special to get excited about. 

I think I may have had my expectations for this place set too high because I was quite disappointed. I probably will not go back..."}
{"text":"I actually really like south st. burger co, because they have guacamole!! and I always ask for LOTS of it, yum! besides that I find the burger juicy and not dry, I like the CHEESE options and This is one of my fav locations because they person putting my burger together is very generous on the ingredients, and you can always for extra, I always get more tomatoes also yum. The toppings are endless and this is why I love coming here. 

It also helps that they search NEW YORK FRIES! yum! 

it just some times annoys me when the person in front of me doesn't know what they want on their burger or takes forever to decide."}
{"text":"They get a 1 star for having NY fries but other than that it's and expensive Harvey's which has been said a number of times in these reviews.  I am not impressed at all and would only return for my favourite poutine!  The staff seemed like they didn't want to be there and when I went there alone for lunch one day they had a kid running around.  Yes the kid was someone's who worked there.  Hmmm very unprofessional!!"}
{"text":"The exterior of the building gives an imagery of a formal-esque restaurant rather than a fast food restaurant, where the description name stating BURGER would normally suggest casual-family dining environment.  

The interior conforms to a medium status similar to the ideas of the most recent Lick's designs.  It did have a single LCD on the wall with a Hockey game on which is the only good I can point out.

Finding our way to the order line, we were GREETED with a newly hired cashier.  She was trying her best but unfortunately it was almost idiotic to a point of frustration.  That was because of her lack of training and knowledge of the menu items and the sales terminal.

My friend asked for Burger & Poutine, and was asked OVER & OVER again if he wanted Gravy on the Poutine for EXTRA fee while my friend REPLIED back multiple times that Poutine should have gravy as part of the dish.

I did the same DAMN mistake and asked for something above average such as the MOCHA SHAKE.  After the cashier rang my order in, she went to make my shake and shortly provided it.

She TOOK it back before I can grab it.  She forgot to BREW the coffee to mix it into the Ice Cream!  I had a seat after getting my Burger and WAITED until the Coffee & Ice Cream concoction was brought out to me after we finished our Burgers.

As we waited in the line for the Burgers, I saw the In-Charge Manager grilling the meats for the Burgers and putting in a thermometer to TEST out each and everyone.  I wasn't sure if I'm suppose to feel SAFER or more NERVOUS.

The Poutine was done as part of the New York Fries side where a young kid was handling it but the lady taking our condiment order for the Burger looked at the Poutine with a TABLESPOON of Gravy on it and she took over and started pouring the Gravy like Niagara Falls, just like how it should be.

The Burger even with what was advertised as HORMONE-FREE Meat and had Specialty Condiments did not make it any better in appearance nor flavour.  

All these things add up to a NEGATIVE Burger & Fries experience when I found myself paying at about the same price as Lick's with the Service & Quality of a vending machine."}
{"text":"Came in for a mocha smoothie, damn it was delicious... more liquid-y than I think a milkshake should be but I think it's because they put actual coffee in it instead of a syrup which is obviously better. I've always trusted their burgers and they never fail but I have yet to eat their burgs at this specific location. Oh, something I did notice was that they had bottled beer here. If other locations have it too then I must have missed it."}
{"text":"I am surprised at how big their 4 oz burger is, compared to other burger places that has a 4 oz patty.

Flavor has always been consistent. I always get the regular beef burger.. yummy! I love how you have so much choices for toppings as well.

Once I tried their hotdog, but I wasn't too impressed, so I never ordered it again. Somehow I find DQ's hotdog better tasting.. :/

Me and my husband always get their poutine, which is a must try! They really do load it up with cheese curds and the gravy is to die for. Not salty at all, it's just delicious!

Cheese is a dollar extra. If you buy a combo, you get $1 off.

The place has a lot of seating, ample parking spaces outside, really good atmosphere. The staff are friendly, and the place is clean and well-kept."}
{"text":"Boo! Was expecting something much better. The meat was chewy and burnt around the edges. Needed more flavour. Took a bit into it and the whole thing fell apart.....big sloppy mess! Toppings were nothing special. For the price I was expecting more. The service was a bit slow but it was a Friday night. Overall I don't think I'll go back."}
{"text":"Service time: 9/10 (6 minutes)
Cleanliness/ atmosphere (10/10)
Food quality (8/10)
Customer service (10/10)

Came here for a quick lunch and ordered the Hawaiian burger combo with a heineken. The service time was 6 minutes, acceptable for food that is supposed to be prepared fresh. The atmosphere of the restaurant was rather pleasant. Top 40s music, very clean environment, floors clean and tables wiped. 
Food came warm and fresh, fries did lack a bit of crispyness and the burger patty was a little too small for the bun. The taste of the burger was great, the taste of the beef was present. The customer service was exceptional, the cashier helped me save money and the line cook took time to explain what each topic was and asked for my desired amount of each topping.
The price was a little bit on the steep side, the beer being $6 and the burger being a little on the small side. Other then that this establishment provided a positive experience. Would consider coming back if not on a tight budget."}
{"text":"We walked in on a Thursday night at 9 PM, an hour from closing. There were no customers inside and 3 employees - one was sitting at a table and 2 behind the counter cleaning up. We stood at the counter waiting to be acknowledged to no avail. The one employee at the counter got up and went to the back and the other two continued to do what they were doing completely ignoring us. It's one thing if they were busy serving other customers but seriously, to not even acknowledge us? 

We walked right out. There are numerous other burger chains in the area where our money was better spent."}

{"text":"Definitely a fan of this place. I'm not going to lie, being a yonge-eglinton person the fact that this place is right around the corner from me gives it plenty of points.

Some of the things I really liked about this place were:
1) 4 different types of cheese
2) tons of veggie options
3) specialty sauces
4) cheap burgers!

Go try it out!"}
{"text":"Why oh why did I go there? Sure, I felt like a burger. Maybe it's remembering the vibe of the now defunct Johnny Rocket. Maybe it's being hungry in that particular area of the mall. 

The bottom line though, I think I would have gotten better food at the A&W at the food court (and this is not a compliment for A&W). 

The meat was of low quality, the ingredients were cheap, and the overall taste was just under 3 stars. 

Never again."}
{"text":"Went here on a Wednesday, mid afternoon.  I've walked past this place several times, but was turned away from how empty the place looked! My Girlfriend and I decided to give it a try nonetheless.

The place had a very nice atmosphere to it. Given the fact that it was completely empty, we were able to get a good look of the place; nice lighting, music isn't too loud, very trendy looking place.

The service here was very nice.  The cashier was more than happy to help us with our orders, especially me being new to this place.  I got a True North burger combo with drinks and fries, and my girlfriend got the nacho burger.

It did take a while for us to get our orders, but when it comes to a high quality burger joint, I expected nothing less.

The fries were what seemed to be re-fried, but that was to be expected for such a dead day. 

The burger however, was something else.Now I haven't been to too many burger joints, so I'm not sure if this is a normal thing, but this was one the only place where they actually cook their red onions to bring out it's sweetness.  Personally I dislike the strong flavor it brings raw, so this was  HUGE plus for me. Along with their unique hamburger buns, special sauce, not overly-salty bacon, and well cooked patty (could have been a little less dry), everything  combined together made one of the best burgers I've had.

Big Plus for one of the better burgers I've had in my time.
Small Minus for Re fried fries, and rather expensive pricing. 

My definite go-to place for burgers in the Square-one area. Bye-Bye Harveys!"}
{"text":"Hawaiian burger and onion rings
They looked like such yummy things
Other yelpers know the deal
And I \"get\" just how they feel
I expected succulence
For this hefty meal expense
The meat was super duper dry
Dehydration makes me cry
The onion rings were MEH at best
Didn't pass my 5 star test.

3 stars!"}

{"text":"5, 5, 5, 5, 5.
I never want to eat anywhere else when I'm at Square One AGAIN!!!!
I was thoroughly impressed with South St Burger Co. and I can't wait to visit a second time.

Never have I ever had a burger WITHOUT cheese and enjoyed it this much.
I let my boyfriend choose and he chose the Hawaiian: Grilled pineapple, wasabi mayonnaise, bacon, and hot pepper relish.
They have a choice of whole wheat buns, which we chose.

We also had a poutine and drink with our burger. And refills on pop were free (trust me, in a mall, this is a rarity nowadays).

The staff was so nice. Answering my multiple questions, attentive, and polite.
The poutine and the burger were just awesome.  I used to dislike New York Fries, but this poutine was delicious.
I liked that they had sea salt and ground pepper on each of the tables.
The single washrooms were also nice.
I like this place a lot. I'm excited to try their other burgers!"}

Never dissappointed.."}

The bread doesn't get soggy cause there not oily.. And for a bonus you have one of the best mainstream  Fries  New York fries.. I always have a good burger when I come here and kids love it.. It's just too bad I live in Brampton which doesn't have one.."}
{"text":"Went back recently using a two for 1 coupon they had in the Mississauga news. At $7 for standard 6-ounce burger I would say it wasn't bad but you won't get any deluxe toppings  and no cheese either. 
 The bun was nice and fresh and the patties were cooked to order. Definitely better than Harveys Angus burger I'm comparing it to a chain but comparable to Hero burger. I also went for the New York fries with gravy. It was pretty good. Definitely want to try out the vegetarian burger, just be prepared to wait is all the burgers at me to order so usually you waiting about 10-15 minutes at least when it's busy."}
{"text":"As far as burger places go in and around the Square One area, it's perfectly fine and sorta middle of the pack...but then again, I think I feel that way about all of them, so who's to say what the middle of the pack even is? I've managed to confuse myself already. 

You see, the last time I was at Square One, I dropped by Union Burger, which was pretty good, had the cool Coca-Cola freestyle machine but was of course entirely overpriced. So this time I went back to South St. thinking it was the best of the bunch all along. What led me to Union (try and follow along, I know I'm jumping) was the fact that the time before that, I went to Big Smoke Burger which was pretty good, had really neat specialty burgers of their own design but was of course, entirely overpriced. So that's why I went with Union Burger. See where I'm going with all this? Good, neither do I. Now there's no Hero Burger in the area and Lick's is (very sadly) all but dead, so thankfully that doesn't complicate things even further. 

As an aside, I miss Lick's. Before their quality began to decline and all of their stores began to close, seemingly en-masse, it really was pretty awesome and a true paradise for the veggie burger (and regular burger) lover. 

So anyways, I'm now stuck in this odd, semi-vicious cycle I have with all of these places and I can't decide which one I like the best.  South St. is (again) pretty good and features New York Fries, although I swear that the New York Fries they serve there aren't as good as the ones you get in the food court down below. Maybe I'm just imagining things. The burger (I order a veggie, being a vegetarian) is a decent tasting patty but I did find it a little under seasoned and a little underdone this time around...perhaps because I had to scarf if down in a hurry, I don't know. Toppings are plentiful, of good quality and the staff is usually quite helpful when I can't decide which wacky combination I want to put on the burger. But next time I'll probably go back to Big Smoke and this whole loop will begin once again. Did I mention that South St. is entirely overpriced? No, I didn't think I had to."}

{"text":"Can you review a burger place if you haven't actually eaten the burgers there? Whatever. I'm doin' it.

Here's the thing: Mr. Rosie S. (a.k.a. \"D\") is OBSESSED. This is his favourite fast food place in the city. He raves. If he knows we're going to be in the Yonge & Eg area, he starts talking about it. 

But... so do all his friends! So it must be pretty good. One of his best friends lives on Broadway Ave, and that is their go-to dinner. Even vegheads can eat here - there's a veggie burger too! YAY! (I just haven't tried it yet).

I've had the fries (NY Fries) and tried the onion rings as well. The onion rings are AWESOME. They're made with red onion instead of white or yellow and the batter is fantastic. I don't know whether they are a South St. creation or something contributed by the NY Fries side of things... anyone?

Context: I have never had NY Fries before this year. I'm 28 years old and have lived in Ontario basically my entire life.

No, I don't know how that happened.

ANYWAY they're pretty awesome for fast food/food court fare, I have to admit!

Nothing like a real resto, I understand, but for fast food, AWESOOOOME."}

A & W & Harveys. Not so busy joint considering its located in sq1 shopping mall, pls save your money go elsewhere. Highly not recommend."}
{"text":"Today marks my third time eating at this place and I can definitely say am really not a fan of their meat patties. I really gave it a chance and am just not digging it like I do with the other burger places I've been to. Its like eating a store bought frozen patty and it just has nothing at all when your eating it. 

The price is inexpensive (kinda) and the menu is pretty straight forward. 

Apart from that, I appreciate how the toppings is neatly displayed for you to choose as part of your burger. Looks clean and organized. And you have an option for white or whole wheat bun which is nice too. 

The area their in at my local mall is located just by exit 9? and the place is hidden in a corner of the mall... so you would have to look for it if you havent been to square one before. The place itself is nice and well decorated (and ventilated)  and I appreciate that. Staff is very reliable and nice too.

{"text":"Good burgers, more grilled than Harvey's.

My go to place whenever I feel like a good burger. Normally it's Harveys but I find even with Harveys their burgers have become lacking since they've dropped their delicious Ultra burger. Their choices of sides are severely lacking.

Not at South St. Burger. Owned by the same company that runs New York Fries, their fries are naturally, made with New York Fries in mind. :)

Burgers are always juicy, hot to order on the grill.  Over a dozen choices for sides, you can get anything you want on your burger, including several mustards like spicy, dijon, sweet, hot to several ketchups, sides such as cucumbers, sweet onions, even humus!  I like their hot relish the most with sweet relish, creates a fine contrast on my burger.

At the end of the day, it is a fast food restaurat but their burgers are delectable to bite into. You can definitely taste the fresh grilled meat patty. Everything is made fresh to order. 

Will definitely drop by at least once or twice a month as it's near my work place. ;)"}

{"text":"Three & a half stars. 

What a delight to meet up with fellow Yelper Carolyn \"Don't touch my chocolate or I'm gonna have to kill you\" B. and her lovely daughters. We met for lunch at the South St. Burger Co. Check another one off the My Decemburger list. 

Basically SSB. is an expansion of NY Fries. My first impression is that it is like an upscale version of Harvey's. Their claim to what sets them apart from everyone else is a really wide range of toppings that is included in the cost of the burger. Ok, this morning I struggled trying to pick out a pair of socks to wear let alone chose between 4 different kinds of mustard/mayonnaise or three different type of ketchup for a hamburger. Even the bun is a choice, white or whole wheat. 

Add on costs are the usual suspects, cheese, bacon, sauteed mushrooms etc. I opted for goat's cheese. I ordered up the combo and had the side of fries and this set me back about $11 bucks. The burger itself was pretty tasty. Note to self; when you load up on the condiments the bun gets super soggy. 

For a place that is based on fries these spuds in a cup are average. I like my fries dry, not oily or shiny, which these were. They do not offer up sweet potato fries on the menu. I did try the rings and they were fairly decent. SSB uses red onions and these rings are not those pre-battered, pre-cooked type. While I like rings my arteries can handle about two of them and I'm done. 

In the end, I'd say that SSB is in the middle of the patty pack. Way better than Hero, Acme and especially Lick's (bleech) but not quite up to the standard of Gourmet Burger or the Burger Bar. 

It's another notch on my Decemburger list. Someone pass me the tums please."}
{"text":"I have been here a few times and I always order the veggie burger and french fries. It was pretty good at first, but recently, the veggie burger has been dry and the bread tastes stale. The portion of french fries is pretty small too."}
{"text":"What I like about South St. Burger is that they have a ton of toppings that you add to your burger and they have always been fresh. The meat itself is grilled in front of you and is seasoned really well. I usually get a burger, possibly add some guacamole on it with some onions, a small order of poutine (which isn't that good here) and a strawberry milkshake. That is what you call a satisfying lunch. They do have vegetarian and chicken burgers but I'm not a rabbit so I don't touch that vegan stuff. The onion rings are also very good too. The batter is not too heavy so that's always a plus."}
{"text":"It was kind of pricey when all is said and done, but tasty none the less.  I got a combo, nothing special...just a 4 oz burger, with a side and a fountain drink, and it was almost $12.  

I was most annoyed about how long it took.  There wasn't a line, no one really in front of me.  I asked how long it would take, because I had somewhere to be.  They said 5 minutes, and in reality it really took closer to 12 minutes to make a burger.  That's a freaking long time.  If I weren't hungry, I would have been pissed off.

I would have appreciated it if the staff had a much stronger sense of timing.  Definitely don't come here if you are in a rush, you will be disappointed.  They don't move fast here."}

They are super slow here.  It's sad to pay so much for a burger that's sub par.  It's definitely expensive for what you get.  I'm not sure where the bottle neck is.  It might possibly be the complexity of the menu, and my burger was so dry and a bit crunchy?  Should a burger crunch?  I don't know.

It's also really really really really slow.  It's actually pretty bad.  I don't think people come here unless they are starving or are out of options."}
{"text":"*3.5 stars*

We stopped in here one evening, mostly because I was starving!  I had one of their specialty burgers.  I don't think it was bad, but it wasn't excellent either, because I can't remember what I had.  I do remember having onion rings though.

It takes a while for them to make the actual burger, but there's a large variety of toppings.  The people who eat here looked happy.  But I prefer burgers from other places.  

this place is ok.  Not bad for chain, but definitely not my fave."}
{"text":"This restaurant is one of the worst burger joints I have ever been to.  The menu is too confusing to understand, their burgers are way too juicy, and the gravy in the poutine isn't thick enough.  Not to mention that on my first bite of the poutine I crunched down on a rock.  I do not recommend eating at this restaurant unless you want to eat a bad burger."}
{"text":"Just underwhelming and disappointing 

After reading some good reviews and ratings; I'm disappointed. 

The service was slow, not sure if that's usual or an anomaly. But taking 8 minutes to serve 2 people seems a bit long for a fast food joint setup. This was a Wednesday night around 6pm. 

I ordered the BBQ bacon burger with double bacon. The white brioche style bun was toasted, which was a nice touch. The small smear of guacamole couldn't be tasted over the char of the burger. Barely a hint of bbq sauce in one bite. The burger itself was grilled but the burger was not a freshly made patty-it was similar to the frozen patties from M&M or the grocery store. 

The fries were cooked but lacked a crispy outside.

For the price paid ($20h, I won't be back."}
{"text":"Burgers are piece of garbage, frozen patty from market tastes better. Only thing that saves this plase are the new york fries which are standard and the onion rings are nice and crisp without being smothered in batter, has a nice light bread crumb like batter."}
{"text":"Came in today craving to eat a burger and this was right in my neighbourhood. I ordered a 6 oz  burger combo with bacon + cheddar cheese (they both costed extra). They also have pre-set burger combos that are cheaper than the build your burger alternative (which most people do). The line moved pretty fast as I went around 3 pm when it wasn't too busy. The quality of the food was great and they paid attention to use new gloves when they were switching between handing the food and manning the cash register (my fast food pet peeve). Something interesting that I pointed out to my friends was that this place actually serves beer (selection includes molson, stella, and steam whistle) from a tap or in bottles. Overall a place I would visit again when I'm looking for a good burger."}
{"text":"Where South Street sets itself apart from competitors like Five Guys is in the toppings.  Cajun onions, garlic mayo, guacamole, etc.  They also have toppings for the fries (both spices and poutine styles).

The regular burger is 519 calories and the small burger is 289 on a whole wheat bun.

The small fries is 400 calories with 1.5gr saturated fat.

See Nutrition info at the website (PDF).  Really appreciate it when they offer this."}
{"text":"to update a previous review.  I have to say things have gone down hill.   Very poorly run with bad service, my chicken burger sat for 5 min drying out over the grill while the manager passively aggressively scolded the staff. I will not be back"}
{"text":"Nice concept but it doesn't go beyond that.

I've always wanted to try south st burger here and it's been supposed to open since last fall.  

Finally came here today and what a disappointment.  Two combos came at $24 and change.  Ouch.

Got two burgers, one fries, one onion ring and two drinks.  The big deal here is if you buy a combo you are paying for everything individually BUT you save $1 off your total.  Not that big of a deal if you ask me.

Onion rings were greasy and they resemble A&W, the batter seemed like tempura which I wasn't a fan.  Onions were too sweet.

Fries were regular new york fries, except they fast cooked them because they made a mistake with our order.

Burgers were too big, very dense.  Not very memorable.

Only good thing about this place is they have free refills.  

People that work here, please don't spray a counter when someone is clearly still eating."}
{"text":"They should just stick to their fries!

Came here during lunch time on a weekend and damn it was hella packed. Considering the amount of people the service was very quick. AS well with the amount of people eating at this place it gave me confidence that the burgers must be as good as their fries. 

The selection is pretty simple, traditional burger, veggie and chicken burger. Plus the usual sides, fries or onion rings. Really like the fact that there wasn't a big selection, average price for burgers is $6, combos $10 and sides $3-$5.

There is a huge selection for toppings, 5 different types of cheese and over 10 different sauces which I was very mad about. The reason I was mad about this is b/c I feel a burger joint should have the basic ketchup, relish, mustard, mayo and ONLY ONE special sauce, NOT 10 plus special sauces. It made my decision that much harder but eventually I picked one out.

Now for the moment of truth, my burger consisted of lettuce, tomatoes, jalapenos, guacamole, Monterrey jack cheese, and wasabi mayo to add a little kick. The verdict, I wasn't impressed by the burger at all. The veggies were very fresh and the wasabi mayo added a good kick, those were the only positives. The burger patty was horrible, very dry and tasteless. Yes, I could of complained about the dryness and get a new burger, but I've heard over a hundred stories from people who've worked in the restaurant business and let's just say suck it up and deal with what you have. Well back to the burger, if you took a bite out of just the patty with nothing on it you would honestly taste nothing, lets just say thank goodness I added the wasabi mayo to give it some flavour. The bun wasn't that great either as it seemed very stale. 

If I happened to come back, I'll just stick with their fries, I mean that's what made the company what it is today right?

Items to definitely get:

- NY fries"}
{"text":"Came here expecting typical service from a Not So Fast Food Burger joint. I was wrong. 
From the moment I came in, I was blown away. 
The atmosphere was very comfortable, great music, people smiling, etc. 
Then after ordering, I was offered to sit and wait for my meal. Once it came, which wasn't long at all, they even took my drink to provide me with a complimentary refill. 
When one of the staff came by to clear tables near me, I was offered another refill. 

I would definitely recommend this place."}

No more smoky environment. Yah!

Staff are super friendly and fries and burgers have been fresh. 

Lots of seats and high tables too. 

Free wifi and overall look of this place feels very modern."}
{"text":"I came in specifically for the blue cheese which I was told they \"dont have anymore.\" I was rushed to decide (but no line up, ) Then I made a stupid mistake by asking for 3 types of onions. The lady indignantly told me \"Sir you already have onions.\" My order was finished and tray shoved in front of me with a mumble. I told Sgt grumpy mumble I wanted it to go and was told \"I should have said something.\" It's probably a really good thing I didn't say something. The something I will say however because I'm not surprised Leaside for the rude service, I'm not surprised that it's Toronto for rude service, But I won't be eating here again and highly recommending people I know don't. It's too bad because the burger itself is actually really good."}

{"text":"Took a takeout order of the true north burger with fries, 16$ for a burned gross burger, had I started eating it there it would've been returned no if no maybe and the fries were way worse compared to mac Donald's,  save your money as this place is extensive and total garbage"}
{"text":"Had dinner here with the gf Saturday night and we ordered the ff:

2 burgers
1 small fries
1 large onion rings
2 pop

Bread choices: white or whole wheat
Cheese: $1 extra
Toppings: free too many to list including chutney,  guacamole and wasabi mayo.

The fries are what you expect from ny fries. The rings are ok. Burger was a little overcooked but ok. 

Bill was $22 but used a wagjag voucher (paid $10 for $20 value) so I ended paying $12 for the whole meal. 4 stars with the voucher, 3 stars without"}
{"text":"I will admit, I generally only go in for a fountain drink because I love how they have one of those new Coke machines installed that offers hundreds of options (including many non-carbonated options like Hi-C and Dasani with 5-10 flavours).

The inside decor is clean with a few tables and stools to sit on.

I've tried their New York Fries poutine. The first time, I wasn't overly impressed but the second time it tasted better. The fries and gravy are both on the sweeter side and their cheese curds are just that...cheese curds. It's far from authentic Quebec poutine but it satisfies the craving.

I've never had one of their burgers but I know many who have and I've never heard a complaint about them.

It's local so I'll be returning but good for a quick bite if you are in the area."}
{"text":"I have to agree with the other review that this is one step up from Harvey's. The burgers are pretty average. The meat seems like pre-made frozen patties - run of the mill... I do like their wide variety of toppings though. Nice to have guacamole as a topping option. I do like the seating area. Nice and open with comfortable seating; big screen TV's with sports playing.
What would I improve? Do a number system so you don't have to stand there for 5-10 min waiting for your burger to be finished cooking.
Overall, it's ok. Might come back."}
{"text":"Unresponsive staff don't listen customers. I asked multiple times for different toppings and the men gave me the same topping on the regular burger and over cooked my meat 

Good sandwiches terrible staff ruined my meal"}
{"text":"This is the third time in a row that the burger has been completely pink on the inside. After this happening two times before we explained to the manager the situation and was not offered a free burger. The only reason we bought burgers again is because it is one of the only burger places that offers a gluten-free bun and my husband is celiac. However this was the result again, and we had to re-cook the burgers at home. Very disappointed as we had specifically asked for them to be well done."}
{"text":"It's been a long time that I didn't come here , so I came after work and it was a nice and not too busy and great service. So I try the Signature Burgers : mushroom Swiss and you can choose 4oz or 6oz burger size and whenever toppings you want and that's nice and large Poutine and it was a great burger and the Poutine was perfect the sauce and cheese, oh and you can choose what bread you want white or whole wheat and I just paid $18 so not bad !! So I highly recommend this place :)"}
{"text":"Bad service by employees for online delivery orders. They cancelled my order even though when I called them, they were open."}
{"text":"This was definitely not my first visit to South St. Burger but definitely the first to this location.  I will not be returning.  The place was very clean and service was very quick.  No complains there.  The issue was with my burger.  I have tasted better at Harvey's and other places.  The bun just fell apart in my hands and it just got too messy to enjoy.  I think if a better quality bun was used, this would not have been the issue.  Excellent selection of toppings.  A bit pricey for the quality that I received."}
{"text":"Hidden restaurant in square one, South St Burgers is located at the second floor near Laura secord. We went here for a quick fix and to our surprise it was t bad.

The restaurant is a lot like Harvey's.  Good burgers, quality buns and toppings of your choice. However, it is quite pricey where the average burger is almost 8 dollars and this is not a combo. The choices sounded delicious and was, I myself got the nacho burger and really enjoyed it.

There's nothing really to brag about this place. It's a high end fast food joint! Lots of sitting area and fast service! They occasionally send out coupons, which I would recommend to use because it would save you a lot of money. However, in terms of recommendation, I would only come here if you absolutely love their stuff or really hungry. Don't come here on a date unless you have a coupon. There are better choices."}
{"text":"Nice selection of condiments.. but other than that I don't see any reason I'd go back.
Fries were average and I did not enjoy the burger, I've had better at home from frozen M&M burgers.
Service was also slow and the burger was done a good 5 minutes before the fries were and really no reason for that as they had multiple fryers they could have used."}
{"text":"This is the first time I've ever written a review without having sampled the food. I want to just state that right off the bat so you don't immediately dismiss me as a weird, obnoxious crank.

So we walked into the place at around 12:00 on a Saturday and there were five or six people in line waiting to order. It'll move pretty quick, I said to myself.

I couldn't have been more wrong.

The person at the head of the line was asking all kinds of questions about additions and replacements and combos and the clerk taking her order was indulging all of it. Look, some people have no consideration for the people around them. That's just a fact. But even if that's so, the clerk should not have allowed this to go on for more than a minute.

This went on for a full five minutes. And I was getting more and more annoyed. But fine, the idiot finally placed her order and a couple more people placed her order and it seemed like we were getting somewhere.

Not quite.

The person directly in front of me began by asking a series of questions. Yes. He himself had stood through that inconsiderate goon at the front of the line and then, when his turn rolled around, he decided to pull the exact same nonsense. And, making things worse, he was placing an extremely large order. I stood through five minutes of this and then I was out the door.

I know I'm probably coming off as unreasonably impatient here. But we're living in a society, okay? You have to have *some* consideration for the people around you. And if you can't do that, then it's up to the people in charge to step in and say, \"hey, this behavior isn't acceptable.\"

I'll never return. (This goes without saying, no?)"}
{"text":"Popped in while in Vaughan Mills doing some Christmas shopping. The place is fairly large for a mall fast food joint.
Store is very clean (probably because it's new) and the burgers are great....one of the best out there.
I went mid-week during the day and it was quiet....but I can only imagine how hopping this place gets during the weekend when the mall is packed.
Staff (cashier) was friendly and efficient.
As an added bonus for Christmas....if you bring in a new, unwrapped toy, with a $10 value (for their annual toy drive), they'll give you a 4oz burger for free. Great to see a company giving back to the community."}
{"text":"Kinda dirty, don't expect it to be cleaner than your average mcdonalds. Food is good, ask for the burger well done. On the pricy side. Take out is better."}

{"text":"Tuesday after work, my boyfriend took me to Walmart to buy some groceries. After that, we had a dinner at South St. Burger, which is across the street from Walmart. It was our first time trying the food at this place.

Environment:

South St. Burger is a local burger restaurant, which has so many locations in Calgary. The one we've been, located on 130 Ave SE, Calgary, which is right across the street from Walmart. Outside look, it is a small restaurant. Inside the restaurant, it's middle size. We arrived this place around 6 pm on the weekday, so it was empty inside the restaurant. The menu is on the big screen on the wall. The customers could see it once they walk to the front desk. There are no many burgers selection on the menu. But, people can create their own burgers at this restaurant.

Service:

The same as many other fast food restaurants, such as KFC, A&W, and McDonald's, we ordered the food at the front. After food is ready, the servers brought the food to the table. Besides that, people could also pick the toppings for their burgers.

Food:

We ordered two burgers with fries, onion rings, and pop. The food came out kitchen fast, fresh, and well cooked. Two burgers sauces were tasty and awesome. But, I do not really like the meat patties. They tasted a little bit overcooked. Fries were decent. The onion rings tasted different from other restaurants. This restaurant has used purple onions for the onion rings. The onion rings were crisp and delicious. Both fries and onion rings were very small portions.

Price:

This place is a little bit expensive.  We had two burgers, fries, onion rings and pops. We spent $28."}
{"text":"Absolutely delicious burger. Nice and juicy and filling. The only reason i am giving them 3 stars is because of the price...12$ for a cheeseburger and a drink.a little pricey."}
{"text":"I know it's a chain, but for a decent burger and fries, this place delivers. Fries are fresh, crispy, and not too oily. Burgers are solid offering with plenty of toppings.

The Hawaiian is the best of the bunch, but for those without a taste for pineapple, the others deliver the right kind of magic too.

The pop machine is a nice feature too, as it allows you to add flavouring to your pop. Cherry or vanilla coke anyone?"}
{"text":"Beef was tasty. However, the kitchen was too slow and the burger didn't justify the wait.
Five Guys has nothing to fear here."}
{"text":"Came in here for lunch. Got the chicken burger and veggie works poutine. 
New York Fries Co. offers 3 poutine choices:  regular,  pulled pork or veggie works
Burgers are made to order so it takes time. About a 5-10 min wait
There were so many super fresh toppings on display and you can load up on your toppings no limit to number of choices, lots of variety. Loved the guacamole at no extra charge and the wasabi mayo! I thought everything tasted great."}
{"text":"I try the Nachos burger which made me sick after. The guacamole was old abtasted horrible. The older woman with square glasses has a bad attitude. I highly don't recommend this place."}
{"text":"I stop by here about once a week.  I usually just get a hamburger as it makes a decent meal on its own.  South Street seems to be more and more popular every time I go, and I have waited as long as 15 minutes from the time I've gotten in line to the time I finally get my burger.  However, it's well worth it.  They basically serve hamburgers, chicken burgers, and veggie burgers, and sides are fries (New York Fries) or onion rings.  Everything here is fresh and high quality.  After ordering and paying you make your way down the line where you can choose from a white or whole wheat bun and a huge assortment of topics.  As an example, yesterday I had hot pepper relish, garlic mayo, guacamole, tomato, cucumber, olives, and cajon onions.  Cheese is extra but all other toppings are included in the base price.  The hamburger patty itself is great, generously sized, and cooked with a tiny bit of pink in the middle, the way a fresh hamburger should be.  The end result is juicy and sometimes sloppy, and delicious.
 
Like most good things, the prices are a little higher.  Expect to pay $10 for a burger, pop, and onion rings for example."}
{"text":"South Street is one of the more reasonably priced gourmet burger joints. It's a chain and this location is closest to where I live. Service is quite good; whenever I come here, there are like 5 rude customers who are complaining about silly things. Anyway, they manage to keep their cool each time (something that I would not be able to do). I love the location because there's a huge parking lot and other stores that I can check out after eating here (i.e. Starbucks, Winners). There's a lot of selection when it comes to free toppings and South Street are pretty generous. 

Good for: burgers, lunch, dinner

PS - They have free WiFi."}
{"text":"I walked past South St. Burger as I was entering Square One and their hot dog poster enticed my hot dog craving.

The hot dog tasted like any other hot dog and actually cost more than street meat. It came up to $4 and some change.

{"text":"South Street burger looks to be owned by new york fries since they sell those too. A few friends and I strolled in on a Tuesday afternoon and the place was empty. Speaking of which the place is really large with lots of room to sit and very clean.

I'm by no means a burger connoisseur (is there such a person?) so take this review as the average joe review. I thought the burger was well cooked, and tasted very good. The bun was nice and soft and the toppings were fresh and flavorful; Specially the blue cheese (mmmm). The portion size was more than sufficient, rather large in my opinion.

I would visit again if I was in the area, but wouldn't go out of my way."}
{"text":"okay mabey i am completley clueless about burgers but this place does awesome burgers! simple,tasty and fresh!"}
{"text":"Stopped in for a burger one afternoon while doing some shopping. Well hubs had the burger, kids had fries, I had poutine since that's all I felt like. Since it's NYF Poutine, it wasn't a new taste for me as I've had it before. Tasted fine for where we were, no complaints from kids either. 

Hubs said the burger was decent, not memorable but it hit the hungry spot.

If the opportunity presents itself again, we would most likely give them another go as the service delivered."}
{"text":"I guess people don't get the concept of better quality beef = more expensive. In any case, my go to burger joint (this side of burgers priest). Great toppings selection, very clean, and they actually listen to you when you say how you want your beef cooked."}
{"text":"I have tried this place recently, it s actually similar to the fast food burger chains.
As per the person who took the order i had their signature burger, and it actually costed 10$, well for a small size burger i would pay that if it was really special. My say it s way overpriced.
As for the burger, the meat is actually tasty though, dry and rubbery, the taste is very sweet with no other flavors to break its sweetness.
I would not give it another shot, and I would not recommend you to try it."}
{"text":"I am never disappointed when I come in for a burger or my usual chicken with goat cheese. I do have to say depending who is cooking that day, makes all the difference. I have had a few occasions where the burger or chicken was way too over cooked.  Either then that not a bad place for some cheap tasty food."}
{"text":"The meat is good, but typical. And the sauces I'm not a fan of. The \"specialty\" burgers have such classing flavors on the same burger. I'm honestly not a fan of this place for the price that you gotta pay."}
{"text":"My husband and I went for lunch before we hit up the local theatre's Stars and Strollers movie. The whole exlperience was a little underwhelming. My husband did the ordering and could barely hear the guy even though they were just a few feet apart. My husband ordered the jerk burger and was expecting a little jerk sauce or seasoning in the burger but it was just a chutney on top of the burger. My chicken burger was a little meh...I've had better. The garlic mayo barely tasted like it had garlic in it. The whole experience was a little disappointing."}
{"text":"Who isn't always searching for the perfect burger? Recently, I visited South St. Burger on the recommendation of a friend. 

I decided to walk on the wild side and taste test their 6 oz. Nacho Burger loaded up with cheddar cheese, guacamole, tomato salsa, lettuce and jalapeño sour cream. It's on their signature menu, for future reference. 

This review is going to be small: the burger was thick and juicy. The toppings are sung wonderfully in my mouth. I'll be honest, it wasn't fancy. It was a fast-food burger (aka frozen patty) but my hands didn't get messy from the toppings and it made for a quick and easy stop off for lunch. 10/10, would recommend."}
{"text":"A long time ago, before the hype, I had a Five Guys burger. It made no impression on me. But people kept talking about how good it was so I tried it again. Still nothing (except realizing how crazy overpriced it is). Then I went here on a whim and I have got to say I totally enjoyed this more. I loved that you could pick all the yummy toppings, though I didn't maximize their potential when I was ordering because I didn't even realize everything they had to order! It is expensive but it is more enjoyable than five guys.
Will definitely return here."}
{"text":"I made my 1st visit today as I received a bunch of 2-for-1 coupons in the mail.  I chose the 2 burgers for 1 deal; I was going to have the veggie burger but then I decided to go for their nacho burger instead.  I only added tomatoes as I think lettuce comes with this particular burger and I found it to be quite well cooked, the right amount of juiciness overall and both the quality and quantity of the toppings and the overall burger was quite good.  The service was quite friendly and although I ordered take-out I did have time to notice that the venue appeared quite clean throughout.

I plan to return next week with another coupon, for their 2 hot dogs for 1 deal."}
{"text":"Had the mushroom Swiss and Mushroom Veggie burger with:
Maple onions
Hot pepper relish 
Garlic mayo

{"text":"This is a good marriage between fast food and decent burgers. Expect to pay a little more than your standard fast food burger joint but they definitely taste better. Expect great toppings like aioli as well. 

It's a good break from the ordinary."}
{"text":"Good burgers made to order. Service is okay. Note - They send out coupons once in awhile so my wife and I usually only go here when we have coupons. Totally worth it to use the coupon deals. When we don't have coupons we just go to a different franchise that has coupons available at the time."}
{"text":"Love this burger joint. Burgers are great. Like the variety of toppings. Different than always the same lettuce and tomato.  Prefer South St. Over the fast food burger places."}
{"text":"I don't know what these other people were on when they went to South Street, I think the burgers are great! I go on a regular basis and would choose it over the mountain of grease from 5 guys and Harvey's any day!

I would put South Street into the category of somewhere between fast food and a sit down meal at a restaurant. Nothing gourmet, just a really good burger! Not as fast as a fast food joint but not as slow as a restaurant.

They GRILL your burger to order (in front of you so you know it's fresh and not frozen), so there is a bit of a wait (raw to fully cooked time), but I would rather wait for fresh then have a burger that is given to me from a toaster and pre-made hours ago. You have a choice of chicken or veggie Burger, as well as a 4oz or a 6oz beef burger. There are lots of veggie and condiment coices to top your burger and you go through a subway type line-up as you choose your toppings. The house sauce is really awesome, as is the salsa! There are also New York fries, poutines and onion rings for sides and milk shakes made from actual ice cream! For those of you who like a beer with your burger they do have a limited selection as well.

I have always had good, friendly service and the establishment has always been clean. The prices are a little higher than your average fast food place but about the same as other similar burger joints (Usually $20-$30 for two people)."}
{"text":"Hard to say much good about South Street other than the resto was clean.
I threw out half of the burger-fries-shake combo I ordered today. The serving was not too large which should speak volumes."}
{"text":"South St. Burger Co. is a franchise associated with the famous New York Fries.  It is located inside the CrossIron Mills Outlet Mall in the fashion neighborhood.  

My girlfriends and I were shopping around for dresses when it hit 8:10PM; it was just that time to find somewhere to eat.  We were going to pass by South St. Burger Co. and I was kind of craving some NY fries and a burger so we hit up this cool joint.

 The mall closes at 9PM during the weekdays so I felt bad going in and ordering because they started to clean up.  We were greeted by a friendly girl to take our order.  They offer burgers, salads, fries, onion rings, shakes, regular drinks and ice cream!  You can make a combo which comes with fries and a drink or switch it up for additional costs.  I went with the cheese burger and poutine (~$13).  Mary went with the same as me but with a drink and Anna went with a cheese burger.  The great thing is you have the option to have your burger on a whole wheat or white bun.  The greater thing is you get to choose exactly what you want for toppings and sauces.  For toppings they offer pickles, banana peppers, lettuce, tomatoes, red or cajun onions, cucumbers, olives and for sauces, they've got mustard, spicy or regular ketchup, horseradish, guacamole, mango chutney, hot pepper or regular relish, garlic (mmm) or wasabi mayo, hot sauce, chipotle bbq or regular bbq sauce! 

There was a little bit of a wait as the burgers are grilled to order so we had a seat and they called us up when our order was ready so we didn't have to stand around.  When we got our food, we had a seat and carefully unwrapped the burgers.  You know your burger is good when you're MMMMMMing before you even bite the burger and you continue to MMMMM while you eat the burger.  FYI: There is no MSG, fillers or preservatives in the beef burgers we had and they're 1/3 lb, 100% pure beef tasty goodness!  Moving on to the poutine (which was also amazing, as per usual), the fresh cut fries were hot and crispy, the gravy covered the cheese curds perfectly...it was just divine.   We all agreed the burgers and poutines were really, really good and we would definitely come back again.

The service was as good as if they just opened.  The food was....so yummy that I'm still thinking about it and the fun thing is you can try new  sauces....take a risk and load the burger up or just keep it simple.

*Schwarzenegger's voice* I'll be back! :)"}
{"text":"This place is amazing for several reasons. Great service, super friendly, one of the best burgers (mushroom swiss) I've ever had. Other places make me sick with the same burger. To top it off the place has a great vibe and my favourite beer. YES BEER! Fernie Brewery. In a frosty glass. The only way it could get better is if they had a patio or Fernie-what the huck on tap or bottled. But they have the other flavours:)"}

How many minutes does it take for a burger to be made? About 10 to 15 if you're coming here. \"Sense of Urgency\" is a word I would not use to describe this place. So if you need to eat and run, I wouldn't recommend it. That said, it's a nice space. A few round banquets make it fun for groups.

A burger and fries. The burger was a bit dry and not worth the value of $10. It's personally how I feel. The fries are from NY Fries so ...YUM. Bonus: extra pickles. 

OBLIGATORY CATCHY REMARK 
With the burger competition heating up north of Bloor (Holy Chuck; Burger's Priest), if these guys don't speed up their service, their company will be going south. Yes, harsh but a reality."}
{"text":"Great burger spot in the financial district thought I've seen tons of these shops pop up all over Toronto. I had the bbq burger and in place of cheese (not a huge dairy person) I got an extra slice of bacon..yum!

The good
- beer on tap
- great selection of burgers
- nice varied Menu with very unique burgers
- nice fries, tasted fresh

The bad
- 14$ for a burger meal is a bit much, I could probably pay a comparable price for a burger at a sit down restaurant.
- I had a 4 Oz and while there's not much of a size difference between the 4 and 6 Oz, price diff is big.
- service was definitely slow, not sure they understand the concept of an assembly line
- all that bacon is deffo salty!
- no choice for a whole wheat bun

Overall I may go again but nothing to write home about!"}
{"text":"I'm a little shocked by the less than stellar reviews for this location, but thought I'd offer my two cents. 

My fiancé and I stopped in at South St for dinner after a very busy day. He ordered the true north burger and I ordered a regular burger with pineapple (pineapple on burgers = amazing!) 
I will admit the  prices are a bit insane but still fairly close to hero burger. I requested a gluten free bun (+$1) and pineapple (+$1) which made the bill rather hefty. My fiancé ordered a poutine which was. $5.99. My -1 star is purely for the pricing! Now for the good stuff ;)

As I mentioned, my order was for a gfree bun. It was toasted in a separate toaster, the server changed her gloves to prepare the toppings and used mayonnaise from a small container (opened in front of me) and their special sauce from an unused container under the counter. I was very pleased to not get sick over cross contamination because honestly, if you're going to do a gfree bun, you need to go all the way and do it right! They did awesome! The fries are also cooked in a dedicated fryer so no onion rings are ever cooked in there! Again, awesome awesome awesome. Also good news? The poutine gravy has no gluten. The manager even brought me the label to read to be 100% sure. That meant I could steal a few gravy soaked fries from my fiancé ;) 

The small fries that came with my meal were more than adequate. They were actually bigger than the small you'd get at Wendy's of mcdonalds. 

The burger was delish - especially with the pineapple. I like that you can add whatever toppings you want and only things like cheese and bacon cost more. You can even get guacamole on your burger for no additional charge. 

Overall we were both very satisfied with the food. The wait time and the prices are a downer but they wouldn't stop me from coming back when I'm looking for a good (gfree) burger!"}
{"text":"Always love visiting South St Burger! Firstly, they not only provide gluten free buns, but they are knowledgable about it and SAFE! The buns are toasted in a separate toaster, the burgers are bulked up with breadcrumbs, they know which sauces and toppings you can't have and will use single use mayo containers for people who have a allergy rather than a preference! 
I ordered a Hawaiian type burger (can't remember the name). It had pineapple, hot peppers, and some sort of salsa. It was delicious!  The cashier at this location was great at double checking to make sure the toppings were okay for me to eat to ease my mind! Double checking = awesome! 
I won't lie and say this place is cheap. It is very expensive and because they have New York fries, you're looking at a $10-$15 combo minimum. Come here if you're looking for a quality burger with a huge array of unique toppings and people who know what gluten free means!"}
{"text":"Solid place. The food here is great, the staff are not the most outgoing but they are courteous. This is a great place to come if you are creative, as the best burgers are the ones with topping combinations not on the suggested menu (not that those are bad.) They have a huge selection of toppings that you normally would have to order a la carte that you can mix and match. I recently made a curry (Indian inspired) burger that was quite good using curry mayo, mango chutney etc. I also have made ones that were Tex-Mex inspired with pepper jack, guacamole, and spicy ketchup. 

Also the fries are great, and to be honest for the price it's not bad compared to other more expensive fast food style burger places in the area, i.e. Licks or A&W."}
{"text":"We ordered from this location through uber eats. Burgers were in terrible condition! It was dirty and messed up. Also none of the toppings were the toppings we ordered. There was a drink missing. Poutine looked disgusting. Literally everything that could go wrong - did."}
{"text":"This place is my fav of the many deliciously-bad-for-you mid-price burger places (hero burger, big smokes, all those places). A little pricer, but a little better imo. They don't skimp on ingredients and put a little more care into making sure your burger isn't a sloppy travesty. And they have some interesting condiments/ingredients.

This place is also super celiac friendly. The gluten free buns are good enough that I was a little scared the first time I ate here because I thought they may have fucked up my order and given me a normal bun by accident. (They didn't, it was just actually decent). Their fries are also in a dedicated fryer so they're gluten free without cross contamination. The staff are awesome for cleaning off their workspace and changing their gloves before preparing a gluten free order, which is awesome! I've eaten here a few times with no cross-contamination issues. ++ recommend

Really, it's fast food at the end of the day, but if you feel like treating your body like a garbage can this place is pretty tasty."}
{"text":"One thing Toronto's big on is burgers, and this place is worthy competition for other similar burger shops out there. 

I like how this place uses naturally raised meat. I didn't try the beef but the chicken burger was pretty good. Warning: Get lots of napkins before sitting down! The burger will literally ooze up your elbows.

There are so many interesting toppings available! Most fancy burger shops charge extra for their toppings but it seems like this place doesn't charge for anything other than cheese or bacon (though I could be wrong). Exciting toppings include fancy flavoured mayos, \"gourmet\" relish, spicy ketchup, cajun onions, fresh cucumbers, blue cheese (extra)... Lots! I think 15 in total. The toppings would be the highlight of this place.

I was also shocked to learn after ordering that they're related to New York Fries! Don't let that scare you away though, as everything was pretty tasty.

Though the quality is better than Hero Burger, the taste is no Craft Burger, but for a less expensive version that's still quite good, this is a good spot.

Staff were really friendly too. 

I'll definitely try the beef burger next time I'm around but I don't think I'll be going near the New York Fries as I find their fries with stuff on them kinda gross."}
{"text":"I was very excited to try a South St. burger and got a nice milkshake and poutine on the side... Milkshake was really yummy (with lots of strawberry bits in it) and the poutine was good (NY Fries).. The burger was delicious 2 bites in... and then I saw it... there was a HAIR IN MY BURGER. I gave it back to the girl at the counter and they made a new one for me. The second one was just as good, though I have to say I ate it very carefully. Too bad about the hair. Good burger otherwise."}
{"text":"Came here for lunch around 12 a few times. The burger is the overpriced and generally not that good. Still, it beats HeroBurger pretty easily. Our order wasn't that big (8 burgers) but 3 of them were not as expected, and neither was the poutine. If the price was more reasonable would probably be a 4."}
{"text":"The food here is good, if somewhat pricey. However, it takes a very long time for them to make your food, time you spend standing uncomfortably in a narrow space in front of the kitchen that quickly becomes crowded. Given how slowly the food is prepared, they should give each customer a number and bring the food to the customer's table when it is ready.

Actually, they do occasionally send customers to sit down and bring out their food, but this is sporadic and does not seem to follow any pattern, which just makes those customers not lucky enough to be chosen for table service more annoyed."}
{"text":"Met hubby here he had a burger & some onion rings. The onion rings were super crunchy. A bit dry & hard if you ask me. Burger was decent but not the best ever."}
{"text":"For starters, the older lady that works there is very rude. We call ahead to order our burgers with all their toppings and when we arrived 30-40 mins after we ordered which is more than enough time they weren't ready. She was rushing us at the cash to pay and then rushing us to get the burgers made. Demanding what we want on them, giving us dirty looks as we sat down. 
Secondly, the burgers were dry, not very flavourful and wasn't anything special. Especially for the $12 for a combo with a drink and fries you pay. 

Lost my business, will not be going back. Five Guys in Oshawa is basically the same price and the best burgers I have had!!"}
{"text":"Everything went wrong when I came here one Friday night. I was craving for good onion rings but when we got to Gourmet Burger Company, it was closed for some reason. So we went to the nearest burger place available which was South St. Oh man, was I disappointed! The onion rings were thin and ghastly and tasted like stale cooking oil. So I kissed my onion rings fantasy goodbye and hoped the burger would make up for it. Sadly, it didn't. I tried the veggie burger but the patty was dry and tasteless and no amount of toppings or not even something as fancy sounding as wasabi mayonnaise could make it any better. The multigrain bread was cardboard-like. Maybe it was my mistake and I should've taken the usual beef and white bun, but I've had good veggie burgers in other places. Okay one last saving grace: I thought maybe the strawberry milkshake might be the saviour-- Turned out it was just so-so and I'd say it had more sugar in it than strawberries. What a sad Friday it turned out to be."}
{"text":"This is new burger place opened in downtown on bay st. Uniqueness is this place is the veggies, toppings and mayos they add over burger. They had spicy onions, salsa, avocado, olives and many more to try on burger. The most important about the burger is it should be juicy and many places that I tried were really dry. But this one was really juicy as they have garlic mayo, wasabi mayo and they also add sour cream. This is my first time to try such combination and was really good. Burger size with all the stuffing was huge enough for dinner. We also tried poutine and fresh mozzarella on it was ausm and gave us perfect taste. This place is worth trying for burger Fans!"}
{"text":"I've been here a couple times to this location since they opened, and have always been pretty happy with the food.
Today though the staff at South St. Burger co went above and beyond for us.
I'm a recently diagnosed type 2 diabetic, and my doctor has put me on a low carb diet, and SSBC has lots and lots of topping options, plus they do a pretty good lettuce wrapping for the burgers too. My wife has joined in on my diet after seeing the weight loss benefits of it.
And today the staff made things even better for us.
I had ordered two burgers with lettuce wrap, one a mushroom swiss and one a nacho burger. The receipt showed this as well. Some confusion occured, as often can be the case during busy times like when we came, and we ended up with 2 mushroom swiss burgers, and I pointed it out to the server who brought the food.
She offered to have it replaced, but my blood sugar was low and I just couldn't wait any longer to eat.
I was halfway through my burger when another staff member brought out a nacho burger and gave it to me with repeated apologies. They didn't have to do that, but it just shows that South Street Burger co cares about its customers and their satisfaction.
We'll keep coming thanks to good food and awesome staff!"}
{"text":"So wouldn't it be nice to call a place where they make assembled burgers and you have to wait 10 minutes for them to make them, but instead you could call them and order in advance? Most places allow for this.  South street doesn't so they lost my business and I went to shamrock burger in Ajax!!! 

Way better!!"}
{"text":"Reviewing this place is quite hard as the consistency swings from barely edible to very good fries.  In general, my 3 experiences puts this closer to 'I hope no one suggests this cardboard masquerading as a burger' place.  This restaurant is New York Fries answer to the gourmet burger trend.  My response is that they should stick with what they're good at.

I'll give this place credit that maintains it pretty darn clean and organized.  I never seen it messed up or powdered flavour concoctions spilled at the self serve area.  The service and cooking is fairly slow.  Definitely do not come here if you're in a rush.  It's not unusual to wait 8 minutes to order and get your food if you're first in line.  Each and every time we've come here, all the burgers are super well done. If we put laces on them, I'm sure they'd match my old leather workboots.  They're very dry and lacking any beefy flavour. One time there was even a chewy gristle. Chicken burgers are worse because not only are they chewy, dry, and completely overcooked.... They also take nearly 5 more minutes to cook! 

So why have I returned here even though I clearly did not enjoy the burgers... The fries!  My first gave me a glimpse of sodium crispy nirvana and I've chased that bad habit. The skin on medium cut fries arrived super hot, dosed in salt with the potatoes looking as tanned as a Jersey Shore 'actor'.  It was so crispy that it makes an audible sound as you eat it.  The insides are soft and fluffy.  The self serve flavours allows you to experiment but I'm a purist. Just a warning... My last visit had just mediocre fries, I'm not sure if they undercooked them or they were old fries. Either way, they were mildly hot but limp.  Blech."}
{"text":"I Yelped myself over to South St. Burger Co. a few weeks ago as I was teaching a few classes @ Northern SS, and found myself looking for the quickest tasty lunch option within 5 minutes of the school cafeteria! 
Walk into South St. Burger and I'm immediately thinking this could be a 5*!
The place is very clean, and you are not overwhelmed with making all choices at once. The staff are the nicest I have seen for any fast food joint catering to crowds from the local high school, and on top of that, they work hard to get the lines moving.

On to the food! The patty, while not the juiciest or largest one I have ever had, is agreeable, and fortunately less salty than the average burger. The toppings and the cheese however, set the S.S.B.Co apart from competitors...first of all, you can even get goat cheese on your burger (not that I'd recommend it) and I don't remember the last time I was given this option in a similar restaurant. On top of that, they have great sauces and toppings ranging from horseradish Dijon and Wassabi Mayo to olives and caramelized onions.
I also tried the Mocha Milkshake which was very delicious and definitely recommended!


The only negative here was that I didn't get the whole wheat bun I had asked for, but I would say for me, this was not the end of the world!

All together, the meal came to about $12 sans fries. Not the cheapest burger, but I would say worth it."}
{"text":"I liked the burger and fries here.  It wasn't the best burger I have ever had but it wasn't too bad.  What I was really impressed with was the amount of \"stuff\" you could load the burger with. Tons of condiments and unique combinations.  Most places charge extra for guacamole but not here!   I approve."}
{"text":"South St. Burger Co. is a \"fast casual\" burger joint that feels a bit like a cross between Fatburger and Harvey's.

The \"feel\" of the restaurant is very similar to Fatburger, although I think South St.'s burgers are of a better quality. The reason I say it's like Harvey's is because you get to choose the toppings for your burger, but the range of toppings is far superior to Harvey's. In addition to all the usual fixings, South St. Burger Co. has things like goat cheese, blue cheese, mango chutney, wasabi mayo, Cajun onions, and more.

I ordered a bacon cheese burger with blue cheese, spicy ketchup, dijon horseradish mustard, Cajun onions, mango chutney, lettuce, tomatoes, and garlic mayo all served on a whole wheat bun. It was one of the best burgers I've ever had, even beating out some higher end places.

As others have mentioned, the fries at SSBC are New York Fries, as I believe that NYF owns SSBC.

The prices are a bit on the high end at SSBC. While there is a family combo that will feed two kids and two adults for $30, this is not the place to go if you're looking for fast food prices. South St. is a step above your average burger joint and it is priced accordingly."}
{"text":"Franchise of burger and fries popping up around Ontario with this brand, which seems to be New York fries. Delicious fries with many tasty and unique options for toppings, like mango chutney or wasabi mayo. The burgers and fries are tasty, I recommend dipping hem in the specialty sauce! Nice service at this location and a spot to sit outside, weather permitting. I've been to many and I have to say that I will always come again due to the nice portions and delicious array of flavours!"}
{"text":"Read the bad reviews and didn't really understand it. It's not too bad, the burger isn't near a Hero Burger or Licks at all but I think it's better than Harvey's.

Pretty expensive too, but from the amount of toppings, you're getting a lot. The menu is a little confusing at first but it's easy to get used to it.

Cool atmosphere too, I'd go here again but probably only on special occasions."}
{"text":"Being in the mega shopping complex of Vaughan Mills, this burger joint looked promising.  It was tucked away in a quieter corner of the mall and had its own private seating area.  I am not sure if my order was mixed up with someone else's well done burger but the ones I received were all super well done and almost too dry to eat.  They do have a lot of toppings to choose from and their fries are also served by their parent companies New York Fries, which were quite yummy.  The lineup was always 8 deep and the wait from order to pickup was painstakingly slow (20 mins for a burger and fries). They do have their own private washrooms found inside which was a nice plus"}
{"text":"Halal halal halal! So far their beef burger is my top rated halal beef burger. Best beef burger I have had!! Please keep it up. Recommend to anyone that loves beef burgers. I mean really, who doesn't :)."}
{"text":"Juicy, flame-grilled 8oz burger (100% Angus beef) that's antibiotic and hormone free always hit the spot. At $10.00 (including tax) for the 8oz, I watch for the BOGO coupon in the mail :) My favourite is the Hawaiian burger with bacon and grilled pineapple. I get my own toppings: mango chutney relish, wasabi mayo, guacamole, lettuce, tomato and maple infused onions. Of course, the fries (NY fries) is a great side. Skip the onion rings as they were inedible the one time I ordered them and the staff were rude when I asked them for fries instead. So if you're at Square One and are craving a nice juicy burger, head to South St.! (Park at the back of Square One, from South St., you can see Whole Foods)"}
{"text":"A few years ago, NY Fries decided to get in on the gourmet burger craze that was hitting the GTA. This chain was the result and now this location marks the third in Calgary and the only ones outside of Ontario.

NY Fries should have stuck to what they're good at. I would even argue that they're not really good at that either.

If you've never been to a South Street before here's what you can expect. Take your average Harvey's restaurant, make it look a more modern, give people the ability to have a beer or glass of wine with their burger, offer a few additional condiments like garlic mayo and guacamole, and keep the quality the same as a Harvey's. There you have it, South St. Burger Co.

Now, there's nothing really terrible about a burger here, hence the 3-star review, they're just not gourmet or anything really that much better than a burger at any other average restaurant. 

As for my experience at this particular location, they're clearly still working out the bugs. The line was fairly long but for some reason, the guy working the grill was not loading up the meat. The rest of the process was pretty seamless, but there was a long hold-up getting the meat onto the buns.

My biggest question is how listeners of The Fan 960 can claim that South St. is the best burger in Calgary. Do they not have taste buds?"}
{"text":"My experiences at South St. Burger was quite plesant compared to other yelpers.

Got the WagJag coupon $5 for $10 so decided to give this place a try. 

Just ordered the basic burger combo $8.70 before taxes so the coupon just enough to cover the combo. 

Love the whole wheat buns they used.. firm and fluffy at the same time. 
Love the toppings selections: guacamole, big leafy lettuces, spicy mayo/ketchup, extra hot peppers...I made myself a spicy burger!

The meat itself I found it quite standard... but for sure it is better than frozen patties and the fact that it is naturally raised or other grimmicky thing they mentioned did not improve the taste of the initial burger. If I have to eat the meat by itself, I would said it is a little dry.. but when I eat with all the condiments I have to say it is A-OK.

The servers I have are all nice and friendly, but I just order the most basic thing on the menu, I really 

I don't mind come back again if I get another coupon... $5 for that combo is a sweet deal... but for full price? I think it will not be the first choice if I want to have a \"gourmet\" burger!"}
{"text":"I don`t eat a lot of hamburgers but I love to go here.  The hamburgers are perfect and I love all the different types of condiments and cheese. Each time you can get a different flavour and very delicious. I also really like the new york fries."}
{"text":"straight to the point. Burgers were wet and soggy, fries were soft, everything was bland, there was a random pineapple slice in my burger. only thing that was good was their drink machine."}
{"text":"Went back again.... still awesome!

What is it on Yelp with burger joints? This one, the works, burgers priest... None have more than 3.5 stars......

They're all excellent!

I just don't get it!"}
{"text":"First time here.... This place seriously needs a new management system and better employees. We were asking the server some questions about the menu and she had some serious attitude problems, even telling her what we wanted on the burger seemed scary. I understand it's almost closing time since we came here pretty late around nine, but all three employees just seem to not care about anything. 

We ordered a chicken burger and the Hawaiian. The burgers were alright, chicken was surprisingly well cooked and juicy. The poutine was a disaster... The gravy was luke warm and had chunks due to it being too old and not hot enough, it wouldn't be enough to melt the cheese curds. We complained about the poutine and they were hesitant and offered to microwave our poutine... But you can't expect to microwave fries, it'll turn soggy. The kitchen staff server then dumped the poutine, didn't apologize and attempt to make another one, which STILL contained gross old gravy chunks. The \"manager\" came by our table and gave us $10 coupon and in a monotone voice apologized \"sorry\" and walked away right after handing it off."}
{"text":"The prices are great.  I always feel as though I've gotten my money's worth here.  There are also plenty of fresh vegetables available to add to your burger.  I've had the chicken and vegetarian burgers and have liked both."}
{"text":"Yay gluten free buns that don't suck!  My only suggestion is that if you aren't too concerned about cross contamination tell them your request for g free is a preference not an \"allergy\" as it is quite the gong show watching the staff gather up the ingredients from isolation."}

If you are in a hurry do not order chicken it takes forever."}
{"text":"Food is delicious. Decent selection for vegetarians
 
It's quite expensive... Almost if not the the same price as if you went to a sit down restaurant."}
{"text":"Went here a few days ago and had a cheeseburger combo. 

The restaurant was clean but very cramped and not very wheelchair friendly as most of the tables were not very accessible, unless I wanted to sit outside on their patio.
I found one table inside where I would not be sticking out into the aisle and blocking it for other patrons, so I just parked there. ( -1 star for that)

The burger took a bit too long to get cooked and the place wasn't really that busy when I ordered. There were only 2 staff and a line quickly formed as I was waiting for my lunch. The girl who took my order had to ask her co-worker how long she had to wait before flipping the burger !! 

When it was finally done, I chose to have spicy ketchup and chipotle BBQ sauce on it. They definitely put on about 4 times more than Big Smoke put on their burgers when I went there recently. 

Combo comes with a small fries and they are not kidding when they say small. 
( -1 star for that) 

I had Mug Root beer for as my drink. Flavour didn't seem quite right but it wasn't terrible. 

A bit pricey but burger was a decent size and the choice of condiments made it better than most places. 
Will go here again, even if I get my order and take it home. I'll also order a larger size fries!"}
{"text":"My burger was not cooked properly.  I will not go back there unless it's to have the New York fries and nothing else"}
{"text":"I had high hopes for this place - a good burger place in Oakville would be a nice addition to our office lunch rotation. Sadly, that search will continue.

Where to even begin?

The menu was confusing - it was not immediately obvious that the difference between Regular and Small was the size of the patty, not the sides. This led to a lot of confusion in our party. Actually getting the burger topped, we were presented with a very nice array of choices - five different cheeses alone! - and astounding ineptitude when it came to fulfillment. I had to repeat each topping twice for the staff member to actually put it on the burger, and even then they nearly omitted my bacon. I'm fairly certain I got a small patty rather than the regular I paid for.

The burger itself was quite dry and tasteless - our group generally felt that McDonald's would have been an improvement. The toppings were good, however, but that's hardly enough to constitute a meal. The fries were not up to normal New York Fries standards, and I have it on good authority that the Poutine was unacceptable - cold gravy and unmelted cheese curds.

Portion sizes were oddly small given the price. The drink was a regular, which would probably be a small at a more honest establishment, and was in the realm of a kid's size by US standards (which are, however, wack). Fries were also on the order of a small at other establishments.

The kicker, however, was the price. My combo - \"regular\" drink, small fries, and a bacon cheeseburger, came to about $13. I wouldn't mind so much if I'd enjoyed, say, the burger part of the meal, but alas.

Maybe some of this can be attributed to growing pains. Maybe the fry quality and burger taste will improve, though I don't expect the value for money to move much at all. I, however, am not likely to witness any such transformation, as I doubt I'll be back."}
{"text":"I like it here. We have eaten here a few times. I enjoy the Nacho burger. They have a lot of variety in toppings, different than the regular toppings. Burgers taste fresh and are quite yummy. The NY fries are always good, but we've also enjoyed the onion rings. Food is good but it's on the pricey side so beware. We will be back"}
{"text":"Head and shoulders above other 'fast food' burger spots.  The beauty of South St. is the simplicity of the menu, and the large variety of toppings for your beef / chicken / veggie burger.

The kicker is that they serve New York Fries (owned by them).

Definitely unseated both Licks and Harveys as my favourite fast-food, but properly grilled burger.

Locations are generally spacious, modern and well laid out.  This one is particularly large since its located in a shopping plaza."}
{"text":"Ventured up to Markham and checked out the South St. Burger Co. joint along Woodbine.  It's a relatively new location in a plaza that's still waiting to fill in.  The decor was nice and simple.  Being a new restaurant helps as everything appeared well kept and clean.

Heading in, I wanted to have a relatively quick dinner before doing my long list of errands for the night.  I ordered a hamburger combo with an added swiss cheese and onion rings instead of fries.  For the fry lovers, South St. serves New York Fries, so that should please a few people.  And for first timers, South St. serves a wide variety of toppings so feel free to go nuts.  This is definitely a strength of South St.'s.  I went with lettuce, onions, tomato, pickles, ketchup, guacamole and garlic mayo on a white Kaiser bun.  

The wait wasn't too bad at about 10 minutes.  But considering its \"fast food\", this could easily be considered a long wait.  But to me, everything is made fresh when you order so the wait was worth it for me.  Grab my food and proceed to try it out.  Biting into the burger was very nice.  I liked the taste of the patty and the toppings well worked together.  However to my surprise, there doesn't seem to be enough sauce with my burger.  I think the problem lied with the Kaiser bun being somewhat very floury.  With each bite, it took away the moisture from the burger as whole.  If it wasn't for the Kaiser bun, this would have been a nice little burger.  The onion rings were nice and fresh.  Battered well and there's a number of seasoning that's available.  I was somewhat rushing but I did put on the California seasoning with my rings and it tasted great together.  

Overall, I liked South St. Burger Co.  Being owned by New York Fries, you can expect better sides than your typical burger joint.  If you're a NYF lover, then you would take comfort in their sides and the seasonings that's offered.  I wish the Kaiser bun wasn't as floury.  I mean it was fresh but the amount of flour really took away from the fresh ingredients, the fresh toppings and the fresh burger.  So even with the floury Kaiser bun, I liked it enough that I would come back."}
{"text":"I tired the mushroom burger and hot dog. I like that mushroom burger very much! One of the best burger I ever had~"}
{"text":"I don't normally eat at chain burger restaurants, but I make an exception for South Street Burger.  I have only seen South St in Toronto, so not sure if they have locations in other parts of Ontario or elsewhere in Canada.

What keeps me coming back is the freshness of the meat and generous, interesting toppings.  They take Harvey's model of build your own burger and amp it up with things like Wasabi mayo, grilled pineapple and sautéed onions (my fav burger is the Hawaiian).  A choice of whole wheat bun is a great option.

The Bay Street location is my fav because it is usually not that busy (I only ever go after a baseball game on the weekends in the summer), is relatively clean and has TVs throughout the restaurant like at a sports bar. I find the King East location much busier and kinda cramped.  Bonus - both locations are licensed!

I don't know if this promotion is still on, but South St used to advertise BOGO burgers on the back of Green P parking meter receipts. My wife and I ate about $50 in free burgers as a result back in 2014 :)"}
{"text":"A burger chain that is a cross between Wendy's and Subway. That is, great tasting burgers where you get to pick the type of bun and toppings you want with it.

There's a significant variety of toppings that gives you a lot of options to try. And, like I alluded to, the burgers are very good.
Fries are decent, not super amazing, but a worthwhile side to your burger. 

They cater for kids too, having varied sized burgers, including smaller ones for smaller appetites."}
{"text":"I ordered a burger combo and it was around $13. I think the prices are on the upper end of burger chains. In comparison with other chains in terms of quality, I would rate South St. Burger Co. above Hero Burgers and Burger King.

I liked the variety of toppings they had to offer. They seem to use whole grain buns which made the burger tougher to bite into. The patties were slightly above average. It just wasn't as juicy and fulfilling as I would like them to be.  The New York fries were decent but not good enough as the ones I get at food courts.

The staff patiently waited for me to decide what to order and was very polite. 

I would come back again."}
{"text":"Have heard about this place a lot from many of my colleagues as it is just downstairs. I went with a friend and we both got the bbq burger but I went for a chicken breast. The \"assembly line\" burger building should work easily but seemed confused and we ended up with each others toppings. 
Burger and fries were good but nothing special. I would probably visit again for convenience but still just pretty meh."}
{"text":"Not the best burgers but they did taste good! The veggie burger was okay, nothing to rave about. Beef reminded me of Hero."}
{"text":"Above-average walk up Burger Bar. Far better than your average take out but on par with its competitors Five Guys fries Smashburger Etc. The service is fast food is tasty inadequate fries are good but you're looking for something different this probably is not your go-to location."}
{"text":"has to be in my top three burger joints now. came here on the recommendation of a boss in my company and was not disappointed in the least. walked in to a bit of a line up, but a very bright restaurant with windows facing the direction of a sunset, and we were here to pick up dinner. when we got through the line up and placed our order, I picked one of the signature chicken burgers and one of the build your own turkey burgers. I was promptly told that my signature burger was set in stone, couldn't take away any topping and could not add any on to the burger...a bit strange, but I enjoyed what the piri piri version had to offer. my significant other ordered a milkshake to go along with our food which was hand made. stood in line to get our food after payment, and the topping selection is kind of over whelming, from simple stuff like lettuce tomato onions and sauces ketchup mustard and relish, to premium free toppings such as jalapeno sour cream, mango chutney relish and Guacamole at no extra charge. with other more premium items being at extra charge (cheese and bacon) at the time of the burgers being made, one lady was doing the fixing of the burgers and one guy was doing the burgers on the grille. even though they weren't directly near each other they were very much a fluid team, which is rare to see, but always a treat to me. I was again reminded that my toppings for the piri piri burger was set in stone, to which I agreed, but when it was time for turkey, I asked for awesome toppings. after all this we grabbed our food and went home to munch on everything. 
the flavors of the piri piri were outstanding, even if it was on the mild side, but the build your own turkey burger was astounding in every way, I also had poutine(of course) to go with this which I have to say, this place has a really amazing, rich and dark gravy which brought everything together. 

a wonderful amount of parking is available, with a little of a crazy parking lot to get to and through. 

transit options are the 110 islington south, and the 80 Queensway if you want to do a bit of walking.

was really happy with my experience/transaction and I can't wait to come back!
5+/5!"}
{"text":"Meh. I've experienced better.

It doesn't make much sense to leave a review for something which is essentially a slightly more polished New York Fries franchise - but just wanted to warn those who may be thinking to visit the place. Don't.

I mean, even for a burger franchise, it is still required to be able to make burgers. And have decent ingredients. And don't waste something like half an hour to make a sandwich.

Guys inside were nice, but they most definitely needed more training - then at least that stuff they make would be served in a reasonable time.

And I call it \"stuff\" because even McDonalds shines in comparison. Sigh. As they say in Argentina when unhappy with a meal but don't want to disappoint the cook: \"Thanks, that Coke tasted really great!\""}
{"text":"South Street Burger is OPEN!!!!!!!!!!!!!! 

I work nearby... In fact, very nearby. I saw it undergo construction and was so excited when \"New York Fries\" logo was all over the walls.

I love NY Fries + gravy. It's my faaav comfort fast food... I first heard of South Street from the Square One location. However I didn't find the price justified when I'd be surrounded by other, more filling food options.

However here in downtown, I think it is quite suitable to pay $13 for the solo lunch. (I'm going to hope you don't eat out often! Bring your own lunch for a healthier YOU!)

They have \"preset\" burgers such as:
- Hawaiian: pineapple, bacon, wasabi mayo, hot pepper relish
- Nacho: cheddar, guacamole, salsa, Jalapeno sour cream

But you can create your own burgers with your own toppings! Of course toppings like cheese and mushrooms would add to your cost, but there are free ones like tomatoes and lettuce.

SO THE AWESOME PART (right now) is that there is NO ONE HERE! I've been here twice at 12PM expecting a crowd. Especially since there are NOT enough tables... I mean, look at Sweet Lulu? But maybe nobody knows about it? (And now it's on Yelp!)

Pretty good burgers (Big Smoke is better)! Thanks for joining downtown!! AND I can get my NY Fries + Gravy without going all the way to Eaton Centre, yayyyy"}
{"text":"Slloooww!!! But burgers are great. Poutine is awesome. Staff isn't that friendly and since they are slow I spend extra time with them. Food makes up for those flaws though"}
{"text":"I was wondering around on my own searching for a reasonably priced late-night dinner in Downtown Toronto. I really struggled to find such a place, until I stumbled upon South Street Burger. I ordered a 6 oz. True North burger with a side of cheese fries.

The burger was juicy and tasty, and the option to add your own spreads and toppings a la carte style. Despite the tasty burger, the fries were greasy/overcooked and overall disappointing and the cheese sauce ($1 extra) was waterier than the drink I got. 

Overall, my growling stomach was thankful to find South Street, and the burger lived up to the bill. I just wish that the sides also had met that standard"}
