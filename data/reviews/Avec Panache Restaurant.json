{"text":"My husband and I have nothing but wonderful things to say about this restaurant! We were looking for a great French restaurant to go to on my birthday and Avec Panache exceeded all of our expectations.  The owners are currently running the show and they do such a spectacular job of it! Such a beautiful and friendly couple! The wife greeted us and complimented my vintage dress; she also gave me some history on the style of dress I wore which made me happy as I love to learn more about vintage history and clothing! When we didn't know which wine to choose she gave us samples which was extremely helpful.   The atmosphere is cozy and romantic, yet good for bigger parties as well. My husband and I really loved all of the art on the walls.  We ordered the shrimp cocktail as an appetizer which was absolutely delicious. For the main course we ordered the French-cut lamb chops which were cooked to perfection and served with the greatest array of vegetables, all delicious!   The chef/owner came out to talk to us, along with others in the restaurant, from time to time. It really made the entire evening special as you can tell how much love goes into the restaurant. When another table overheard it was my birthday, they wished me a happy birthday as they made their way out of the restaurant which was totally sweet! The owners later told us that they have many regulars and at times different tables will end up talking to one another. Such a friendly atmosphere all around (Without being in-your-face!)   For desert we opted for the Chocolate Mousse Cake. The menu says it's for \"Chocoholics\" and that statement is very true! I only like to eat chocolatey chocolate cakes and this cake was exceptional! It is also flourless, and was melt-in-your-mouth good. Will definitely be getting that again!  Overall it was a fabulous experience. My husband and I left in such a positively happy mood. I even think we stayed past closing time but you would have never known. They did not try to rush or kick us out, making the entire experience that much more authentic and enjoyable.  We have put ourselves on their mailing list and will return soon with more friends and family to share this wonderful experience with.  Thank you Avec Panache for making my birthday a very happy and memorable one!"}
{"text":"I'm amazed that anyone would write a good review of Panache. Our food was terrible. One of our party ordered a salad that was clearly iceberg lettuce (I would think a restaurant could do better) and the entire salad was made up of the brown, end pieces of the lettuce head.  Someone else ordered a 3-cheese pasta dish that did not taste of cheese at all and our third ordered a dish that was not distinguishable as food.  The service was surly, at best, despite the fact that we were the only people in the restaurant.  I am amazed they are still in business."}
{"text":"I've just recently begun to explore some of the new additions to the Junction neighbourhood and was excited to try Avec Panache.  I met a friend for dinner on a Wednesday.  Having just received their liquor license, there were only two red wines and one white available by the glass.  My companion ordered the merlot and I had the cab sauv - both were good.  The menu is very reasonable - with entrees from about $10-25 and apps and desserts from $6. (The menu is available online - these prices are just from memory.)  We ordered lamb chops and moussaka, then for dessert - all were very good.  The only disappointment was that the espresso machine was not installed and I could not have an Americano with the rich, creamy trifle.  I settled for brewed coffee (which could have been fresher, but since the meal was so good and for such good value - I couldn't complain).  I have reserved my comments about the service because it was so curious to me that an established restaurant owner (the folks who own Panache have a long history in Toronto) would hire the server we had.    He was not only inexperienced (which is forgivable), he was so obtrusive it became almost comedic.  In fact, it was like being served by Basil Fawlty on a bad day (minus the actual laughs).   The rudest thing he did was a doozy; we arrived at 8pm and he did not mention they were closing at 9pm.  Instead, when we got our bill at about 9:05 - he made a big show of yawning and stretching and saying it was his bedtime!  Then, he forced us to split the bill down the middle - halving it and entering the amount into the hand-held credit card machine without asking.  He also stood over us while we sorted out a tip.  For me, it was a no-brainer ($0!).  For my friend, who gets flustered a little easier - it was really upsetting.   Anyways - I'm sure this guy has gone on to find his true calling, whatever that may be.  Don't let it deter you from trying the restaurant - it really was good and I will be back.  During the day.  (Hint: Not on a Wednesday)."}
{"text":"Came here the other night to celebrate a family friend's retirement. Situated in the heart of the Junction, Avec Panache is a local establishment that's run by a husband-wife team. AP has been open for four years so it's a fairly new restaurant. I really loved the decor - including the exposed brick walls. This place can maybe have forty people so definitely inquire about a reservation. The menu is small, but it has something for every palette. With every dish, you can tell that there's care in the preparation (see my photos). I had the grilled halibut with lemon caper butter sauce, which was delicious! I can't wait to come back again to try other items on their menu, including dessert.  Good for: celebrations, parties, dinner"}
