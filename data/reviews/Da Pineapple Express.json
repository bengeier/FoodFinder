{"text":"Husband and I learned about Da Pineapple Express through UberEATS. The food arrived on time, warm, and taste good. We had:

Simon
Korean Fried Chicken
Lumpia
Spam Musubi* we're saving those for later

We will be ordering from the through UberEATS again.
We give them 4/5 because the lumpia sauce was missing, and the simon was a bit small but good."}
{"text":"Nice place, good food and very nice people.  I will be back to try the Lechon next time."}
{"text":"Awesome food and great service! I've seen them at the Great American Foodie Fest and drove all the way from Mountains Edge to give them a try and was worth the trip."}
{"text":"This location is now Touch of Aloha. See the separate entry for them. Great Hawaiian food!"}
{"text":"What a great addition to the area. Two of my favorite foods in one restaurant (philipino & hawaiian). Great customer service and the food is excellent. Everything is cooked to order. Call ahead and get your food sooner. Cant wait to try other stuff on menu."}
{"text":"I ordered the Korean Chicken the taste was good and the portion was nice. The mac salad was really good too."}
{"text":"I catered an event for work with Teriyaki Chicken, Mac Salad, and Rice. The food was DELICIOUS! It was ready on time and fresh. Everyone at work raved about how delicious the food was and many stayed the mac salad was the best they had ever had. Everything was super ono and with great service. Thank you Da Pineapple Express for such a great experience."}
{"text":"I'm from Hawaii and been hearing about this place for a while from my coworkers. I ordered a poke bowl, chicken Katsu and Pulehu steak. Chicken Katsu was good. The Pulehu steak on the other hand was not. I've had some real good Pulehu steak and this just tasted like hard cheap beef saut√©ed with onions. I am super disappointed. I would come back here only if I am in the area. Other than that I'm sticking to my 808 mixed plate on Craig!"}
{"text":"Tried this place tonight for the first time. I'm from Kauai and I've yet to find food here in vegas that was like those good ole diners you could find in Hawaii. I got the loco loco and it took me back home with a comfort like I haven't had in a while!
The only little disappointment was in the spam musubi's only cause i wanted it to have a little more flavor. Like a splash of shoyu or teriyaki."}
{"text":"I had the lechon kawali w/ tomato and onions. OMG!! This is the best I've had in Vegas (Thelma's being second). The lechon was nice & crisp when served to me... tomatoes was fresh & crisp, not soggy. They served the right amount of meat & fat.  Most places are so stingy and give you a bunch of fat pieces!  I'll def' be back for some of that! My mouth is watering just thinking about it.  I also tried the lumpia which was different. I'm so used to the traditional ground meat in there... not sure what kinda lumpia it is (my friend just offered me some).  It wasn't not good, I just didn't care for it.  The owners and staff are so welcoming!  They were closing and my friend and I were still talking/catching up.  They didn't force us to leave at all.  They said, we still gotta clean up in the back so we can all leave at the same time.  Such awesome people."}
{"text":"Food was delicious, service was great, felt like i was back home.  My hubby was in heaven eating the Filipino food!  We'll be back!!!"}
{"text":"Chicken thighs were chopped up and served nicely in the container, but there was very little chicken. Most of it was chicken skin and it tasted terrible. I ordered through uber eats and am now going to find lunch cause the chicken was not edible."}
{"text":"I ordered the chicken katsu plate, Hawaiian fried rice, and saimin.  The chicken katsu was burnt, almost like that taste when somethings frozen and stuck in the deep fryer. Didn't like it at all! The fried rice was ok..needed more flavor. The saimin was ok too..again needs more flavor. Overall, i was disappointed."}
{"text":"I was so excited to try this place! Kept seeing signs advertising this place, checked on yelp and saw pics of delicious food that I wanted to try. First I tried to order the pulehu steak with onions but unfortunately that's only served on the food truck (so we were told). Second I tried to order the breakfast special with french toast, Portuguese sausage, egg, and rice but unfortunately that's only a \"special\" so they never know when they're going to have that \"special\" (so we were told). Third I tried to order the 2 item with lechon kawali with onion and tomato and chicken adobo but unfortunately they ran out of lechon kawali (so we were told). Well... 3 strikes and you're out so we left! Too bad we couldn't try the food because I'm sure the food would've been delish... I would hope."}
{"text":"First time at this spot, I got the mix plate with steak n onions and Korean chicken and chow fun. Brother got bento and lechon. Sister got saimin. Like other reviews the steak was chewy, but my Korean chicken was delicious.  I was impressed with the chow fun. Hard to find Hawaiian style chow fun in Vegas. Only Chinese style which I like from China one.  My brother said his bento and lechon was good. Saimin was good too. All in all, this place is worth a try.  I'll go back back and try different things. Got high hopes."}
{"text":"Good food, solid value.  A little long of a wait for just two people, but I guess there were a lot of to-go orders being prepared.  

Not a fancy place, but I'd rather have good food and good value than designer paper napkins - as most of my readers know by now.  

Military discount, easy parking, friendly staff.  
Con: No soda fountain when I went, so I could refill my soda water/lime.  I drink about 4 to 6  8oz servings of drink when I eat, so it's important to me."}
{"text":"Absolutely some of the best Hawaiian and Filipino food I've ever eaten! Extremely kind and generous people run the establishment and like their motto says... If you're not feeling the aloha spirit of sharing please return another day  it's well worth the drive out of the strip to taste some amazing food"}
{"text":"Remembering how we all enjoyed the food truck when they're at Pure Aloha so we were very excited about the stand alone restaurant. I want to say fist and foremost about the effort and Aloha you get from the owner and workers, much Mahalos for that!
Pulehu steak and Korean chicken combo was all we used to order from the truck and would always only get that meal, and sometimes order that to go before leaving the event, Haha, how nutz is dat! 
Unfortunately Teri steak and a breaded steak instead is served and not the more basic Pulehu unless it's on a special? I was kinda confused about not having what to me makes them very popular with the truck?
Korean chicken was ONO as I remembered and I had it with the breaded Teri beef (not bad).
Kalua \"pork\" was a little bland and not very much of a portion for a single item entree.
The Teri beef was not very tasty at all and was very chewy.
Overall, just feels like they're still trying to work out the kinks on the menu, I can only imagine getting all of the suggestions from all the customers.
I think you're probably hearing the same things, \"do you have the Pulehu steak\"? Haha, but I bet it's true.
I'm not biased on local foods at all and I know the differences between \"Hawaiian BBQ\" places and the real local Kine grinds in Vegas and Henderson and this one just fell a few spots on my list of to go places.
My 2 cents, Pulehu being the first, Korean chicken being the second items on the menu, and with the cool monitor menu..advertise your entrees with pictures! It'll be a lot more eye appeal just seeing how ONO everything looks before you order. 
You can never satisfy everyone, and the \"Flip Side\" of the menu only made me want to order Filipino food instead, but I drove 20 mins to get my local fix. Almost made me feel like I was ordering from a 2 restaurant menu instead of 1. 
I for one go to places where I know I can order and always be satisfied with the same good old food that there're popular for, I hope this place will be one of them in the future, but for now we'll have to wait and see."}
{"text":"I came in today and we ordered the katsu chicken. Was amazing. The portions were generous.The staff was very attentive. They really showed their true Aloha spirit. Loved it. Will def be coming back for more. We were told to try the Korean chicken for next time."}
{"text":"Homey atmosphere, amazing comforting authentic food and even greater people running the place."}
{"text":"Ordered food today but very dissapointed!!! Ordered pork adobo but meat wasnt tender it was still hard, ordered lechon but it wasnt what i expected because it was cut into small pieces of pork thats deep fried and wasnt crispy enought!!! Hawaiian fried rice wasn't all that great!!!. Ordered peluha steak but it didnt have that much flavor!!! I don't whos their chef/cook but their food is nothing/waste of money compare to other filipino restaurants like Fiesta, Loraine, Nanay glorias, plus their food is more expensive than other filipino restaurants. I regret wasting my money ordering different dishes just to lose interest eating because it wasnt good or flavorful at all."}
{"text":"Came here for dinner!!! Amazing food and service!!! Clean and friendly!  The tuna poke is amazing and so is the chicken teriyaki!!!  Check this place out!!! I will definitely be back!"}
