{"text":"I ordered lunch from Ron's Pizza Palace after a staff member of theirs visited my work's building to promote Ron's to nearby businesses. The staff member gave us all a menu and mentioned a discount we could use for the day, so my coworkers and I figured we'd give them a try. And...I was pretty underwhelmed. 

For starters, a couple people definitely had problems ordering due to a poor connection or something like that. Fine. It happens. But then when our food eventually arrived the poor deliveryman told me that he had no idea how much my lunch cost. Fortunately, I'd gotten that info when I ordered. But what in the world did he plan on doing if I hadn't calculated my payment in advance? Would I have had to call in to sort out their staff's mistake? Would I have just handed the guy a random amount of money and waved him off? I have no idea.

And the food itself certainly left a lot to be desired. I had ordered mozzarella sticks as an appetizer, but they did not impress me. The cheese was anything but gooey, and I ended up eating a couple sticks in one bite because the cheese simply wouldn't rip apart when I bit into it. The batter on the sticks also left a pretty bad aftertaste in my mouth, so much so that I chugged Coke after every bite to try to make up for it. 

As for the sandwiches, my coworkers complained that their hoagies all came with too much mayo - one girl had even asked for her mayo to come on the side. No such luck: it came on her sandwich just like everyone else. As for me, the ranch I had asked to go with my buffalo chicken hoagie didn't even arrive. I used some from the company fridge. And the ranch was the only way I could eat the sandwich, which was drowning in buffalo sauce and could have been taken out of their toaster a lot sooner - entire sections of my sandwich's bread shouldn't break off when I bite into it, but that's what happens when you over toast something so badly...and is what happened here.

I currently don't plan on ordering from this place again. This is a prime example of \"you get what you pay for\" - and personally I'd prefer to spend a couple extra dollars for a tastier and more satisfying lunch."}
{"text":"Ron's Pizza Palace is cheap. If the only requirement for your meal is that it costs less than $10, Ron's still wouldn't be your best option.

Today I ordered an \"antipasta\" (sic) salad that came with wilted lettuce, thinly sliced, low quality deli meat, rotting carrots, and an overabundance of some shredded white cheese. The entire combination filled slightly more than one quarter of the styrofoam container it came in.

On multiple occasions in the past, I have ordered hoagies from Ron's. While I have had enjoyable hoagies from Ron's, that is not the standard experience. The hoagies are very inconsistent in terms of quality, occasionally good, frequently bad. If you get a hoagie, I don't recommend one with produce on it. The produce in their hoagies is as bad as their salads.

I won't be ordering from Ron's again, despite the inexpensive menu. I'm all for a cheap meal, but only if a certain standard of quality is met. With Ron's, you are better off considering fast food."}
{"text":"We ate here often when there were on East Ohio before the road restructure. We have adopted a new life style and try to eat healthier and though they offer salads, I am too tempted by the unhealthy selections. Tonight we dined on one of our favorites and it was just as delicious as I remember...a steak wedgie. Dough as fresh as always. Large was enough for 2, with enough left over for tomorrow. I was as satisfied as I had been in the past! Thanks, Ron's!"}
{"text":"Was going to try the buffalo pizza. Tried to call about 9:15 pm Saturday night and they didn't even pick up the phone. They'er menu says that they are open til 10pm  Disappointed again! No longer going to try."}
{"text":"If you ever wanted to eat in a palace, well then get back in line, because they only do takeout. Ron's is good pizza. Nothing spectacular. I never expect spectacular out of my pizza, just my Primanti's."}
