{"text":"Quaint little \"down home\" breakfast/lunch restaurant. Out of the way so not easy to find but worth it once you do. Service is good, even the owner/ cook came out to greet us. Coffee was filled over and over. Food was good and not too high priced. Good place for a decent meal."}
{"text":"The best breakfast place ever! The food is always delicious and the service is great. I have dealt with stomach issues for years but I can eat here and have no issues. They also have gluten free food that tastes GREAT!  For a wonderful breakfast experience come and eat at JP Pancake."}
{"text":"Found this on Yelp after top rated Butterfield's was jam packed.  There was no wait here.  There was one man waiting tables and two more in back.  What was very odd was that the waiter, who was the only staff member interacting with the customers, completely ignored not only my family and I when we entered (I was pushy and got a seat) but three more families that came in.  I saw him looking at them out of the corner of his eye but no verbal recognition at all so they all left.  It was quite odd.  The food was ok, I had a Western Omlette that was smallish and a little greasy.  The cooks in the backed seemed physically unkempt and wore no hair nets with longer hair.  Isn't that a rule?  Two stars for reasonably quick service and ok food.  I won't be going back."}
{"text":"Slow slow service, very dirty place, menu complicated any topping that you add is an extra charge, food average : Go somewhere else you will be there for at least 1.5 hrs for just breakfast"}
{"text":"I love JP Pancakes the service was really nice and I had BlueBerry pancakes and it was fantastic and my meal was free becasue it was my birthday."}
{"text":"Their baked and regular pancakes are great, we went there two weeks in a row which we never do. The service is also upscale."}
{"text":"I love this place and always take people with me to share the delicious experience. The food is fantastic, the service is good and I can always walk in and grab a table. I wouldn't hesitate to go back as often as I could even if it is located far from where I live. Try the pigs in a blanket, the breakfast burritos or the oven baked pancakes. All the food is amazingly good."}
{"text":"We were visiting our friends in Mesa Az and they introduced us to this fantastic pancake house! They have delicious gluten-free pancake and French toast options.  They made me a burrito that was vegan!

It's a very relaxed environment so you can come in your comfy cloths.  Lee the server, who also created the art work on the walls, is very witty and offers attentive service.  

I highly recommend eating here!"}
{"text":"We loved it here nice service, place, prices and the food to die for... We are definitely coming back because there are many options and it's gluten free!"}
{"text":"I used to love this place but it seems to have gone down the toilet in the past few months. 

My husband and I have LOVED their \"Famous French Toast\" but the last time we went, the French toast was TERRIBLE! It seems like they changed the recipe or have new cooks who don't know what they're doing. It was caked with cinnamon which was burnt and if you've ever tasted burnt cinnamon, you know how gross it is. When we sent it back, it came with even more, as if they were pissed and piled it on just to get back at us for not liking it the first time. When we told her it wasn't good the second time, the waitress was sort-of apologetic but I think it was her boss (the owner) who made the crap so she didn't want to sent it back again and make waves. Being somewhat non confrontational, we paid the bill and went on our disappointed way. 

It's too bad that we no longer have our beloved JP. There are so many places to go for a good breakfast, you have to hire some decent cooks and treat your customers better."}
{"text":"One of the best places to go if you are looking for the true home made feel of breakfast food.  The oven bakes are to die for but the true breakfast you get with getting simple buttermilk pancakes with eggs toast and home fries make for a meal you won't soon forget.  The Staff is very friendly and offer as much help as they can.  This place can get busy but with free WiFi and a good cup of Joe you won't even notice the wait for food.  I tell everyone about this place and so should you."}
{"text":"Love love love the oven baked pancake! Service is hit and miss and seems worse the less busy they are."}
{"text":"I hate being a Negative Nelly. But, here goes. I do not know how this place stays in business. I'm gonna keep this brief. Husband and I went there for breakfast on a Sunday morning. Kind of a cute place, a few tables filled, etc. High hopes since this is within biking distance from home. Order drinks, food. Me: Spinach bacon omelet and home fries He: 2 eggs over easy with home fries and toast. Server informs us out of taters. Huh?! 11 am on a Sunday? Out of a major breakfast staple!?I should have left right then and there. I'm from the Midwest and I need my taters! Alright fine. I get a choice of toast or fruit. I say I would like both since you are out of the taters. She leaves, comes back and says: \"We are going to have to charge you for the toast.\" Say what? You are charging me $9.25 for an omelet and potatoes. You just told me there are no potatoes. That is like half the meal! And you can't throw in a couple cheap pieces of bread to make up for it?! Sorry. No I will not pay extra for toast. No I will just go home and write a yelp review instead. Omelet came, it was dry and boring. My 8 year old could have done better. With tip, this \"delightful\" meal came to $27. (I do not believe in punishing the server for things out of her control.) Rip off of the year. Will never, ever go back."}
{"text":"We eat at their other location at Val Vista and Baseline.  Food is always terrific, they have the best sausages in town and the only great German Pancakes we've found.  Place is a little hole in the wall and nothing to look at, but we drive 40 miles for the food!"}
{"text":"I was once a huge fan of JP Pancake...  But the key word is WAS.  Today's experience was as flat as, Well, a pancake!  I asked if management had changed, or if they had gotten a new cook.  They responded no.  Same as always.  But I can tell you something has most definitely changed...  Quality and portion sizes has gone down significantly.  I am so disappointed that the greatness has vanished."}
{"text":"Very laid back enviornment. I have been here a couple times now and it's always good! I go for the Gluten Free pancakes. My brothers are fans of the oven baked pancakes. Everyone that works there is friendly, give this place a try!"}
{"text":"My husband and I went to JP for breakfast.  I had the special--banana bread French toast with one egg and two slices of toast.  Loved it.  Hubby had the blueberry oven baked pancake.  He also enjoyed it.  I REALLY wanted to give them 5 stars. Really!  The reason I did is because the place its in is weird!  I walked an almost canned my ass because of the slick floors and again walking out.  Weird d√©cor and the table and chairs look like they came from a garage sale set up in a gas station.  Seriously the place looks like a gas station with table in chairs set up in a corner.  So sad."}
{"text":"Gluten Free waffles and pancakes!!!!!  Had banana pancakes.  PERFECT!  Nice to feel like a regular human being at breakfast; instead of my normal staring at everyone else's food.  Hubby had omelet.  Looked really good, he liked it.  Forgot to take pictures as we just dove in.  Kinda weird to get to with yelp mapping- back of shopping center.  First time here.  Will be back. :)"}
{"text":"I wanted to start the day with a decent breakfast in celebration of father's day. Our reasonable expectations were crashed at JP's today. The poor service was disappointing, but more so was the food. After a long while the food made it to our table and it was half the amount normally given. What happened? I wanted to ask the server, but she was too busy serving the entire restaurant; she was in no mood to receive comments. Too bad, I think iHop just got back their old customers."}
{"text":"Service was quick and friendly. First time in a long time that I had an omelette that didn't fall apart when I touched  it. Pancakes were great as advertised."}
{"text":"My husband and I ate at JP's yesterday.  This was our first time at this establishment and I have to say I  was \"underwhelmed\".  After we debated if we should seat ourselves or wait for a hostess we opted to find a table which wasn't hard since the restaurant was only about 1/3 occupied.  Our server did take our order right away.  We received our coffee and then we waited.  While waiting for our food, I unwrapped my silverware pack and noticed I had a dirty fork (food caked on it) and I set it aside to show the server. In the meantime my husband and I finished our coffee and wanted a refill but no one acknowledged us for over 15  minutes.  I finally flagged down another server (which I later found out was the owner) and asked for a refill on my coffee and pointed out I had a dirty fork.  There was no apology only \"here is another set of silverware\".  She left the table and I opened up my new silverware pack and much to my dismay I had another dirty fork.  At this point I asked my husband to look at the fork because I wanted to make sure I was not being too critical due to the lack of service.  He just shook his head in disbelief.  About ten minutes later our food arrived and again I asked for another fork which finally came from the kitchen unwrapped and clean.   My husband ordered the three egg baked omelette which had good flavor but seemed small compared to the title.  It came with home fries and toast.  The home fries were greasy and tasted like they were reheated.  I ordered eggs over easy which was sent out with one broken egg and the second one overcooked.  I ordered a side pancake (we had to find syrup at another table) which looked thin and rubbery but to my amazement just melted in my mouth.  Unfortunately due to the service and the quality of the food versus the cost, I will not be returning."}
{"text":"I received a groupon to eat at JP Pancake and since I had never heard of it before I looked it up on yelp first. The reviews were pretty mixed. Unfortunately I would say this is the worst dining experience I have ever had. 

We got there on a saturday at about noon.We were told to sign in at the front and we went outside to wait to be seated. we were sitting at a table outside and were brought menus and drinks by the busser about 10 minutes later. Although we didn't really want to sit outside, it just happened that way. We were never asked to go sit inside or where we would like to sit for that matter. About 15 minutes later the waiter/hostess took our order. I really wanted to try that oven pancake but we had already waited a while and I just wanted to eat. I ordered the waffle combo and added blueberries. Came with 2 eggs and 2 slices of bacon. My fiance ordered the #1 burrito. What we thought was our food came out somewhat quickly...however, there was another table outside and that was their food. Ours followed right behind. No big deal, we just switched plates.

 Our table was missing syrup and silverware so the waiter told us he would be right back with it. We waited for it...eventually my fiance just got up and got our syrup. The waiter then noticed we needed silverware and finally brought that. He offered to bring another cup of coffee as well and never ended up bringing that. 
My bacon was limp and my scrambled eggs were runny and smelled like fish. Absolutely disgusting. My waffle was nothing special. I would have been happier with an eggo. The breakfast burrito was decent at best. The potatoes in it were still hard. The other couple outside with us mentioned their food was horrible as well. 

They closed at 1 and numerous people were turned down to eat there after about 12:30 and told that they were out of food. Several people left upset.

I will never be back to see if this place gets any better."}
{"text":"Good food. Crazy business on a regular basis. The staff is friendly but it appears they work on a skeleton crew."}
{"text":"Amazing pancakes. Not sure what they put in them, or how they make them. Best I've honestly ever had. You won't be disappointed. I prefer the thinner classic pancakes over the thick baked ones."}
{"text":"The service was spot on, perfect. No complaints whatsoever in that category. Now the food.

We had the baked blueberry pancake that supposedly has wild blueberries. They were a bit more tart than I would have expected. The pancake came out hot and the overall flavor was good. It wasn't huge and that's important since, that's all you get is a pancake. It does not come with any sides. My wife had a burrito. I forget if it was the #1 or #2 but regardless, it was somewhat plain tasting and there was no topping such as a red or green sauce. And again, no sides. Not even guacamole or sour cream. So we asked for sour cream. A few minutes later, our waitress came back to us and said they were still looking for it. A few more minutes pass and still no sour cream. Finally, about 10 minutes after asking for it, she comes back and gives us the sour cream - she was very apologetic for it taking so long (another example of the courteous service). Unfortunately, either the sour cream was bad or it was some brand we'd never had before but it didn't taste at all good.

My coffee was good, hot and was constantly refilled by the staff. Again, they were very attentive and polite.

Their pricing, given what you get, is a bit too high. I don't see us going back there without some sort of coupon in order to try something else. The lack of the meals being complete - not having any sides or toppings - is a disappointment.

Service 5 stars. Food 3 stars. And while great service is important, I would rather have 4 star service and 5 star food."}
{"text":"Food was subpar at best. Dumpy inside, shabby tables and chairs. There are a lot nicer places with way better food that you can get breakfast for the same price."}
{"text":"Dont eat here. We came because of a groupon deal but the service is bad and the food is meh. The greeter was super indifferent and we waited a long time for service at our table. The food was really greasy, the eggs were cold and cooked wrong and my boyfriend had hair in his fruit cup. When this was replaced, by the busser, no one ever apologized. No one even asked how the meal was at any point, but i'm assuming thats because they dont like the answers they get. The final insult to injury was that the waitress wrote in her tip on the bill with out any kind of disclosure. Very tacky, way too much breakfast competition in scottsdale to give this place even a first chance. Go to butters or chompies."}
{"text":"This place seems like it would be nice, but quality is awful. Although the food is somewhat decent,  portions are small, food came out cold, and waiter was not polite (I think he was the owner as well). 
It is not the best place for breakfast...Pretty mediocre. 
Setting is very small, but clean."}
{"text":"I would not recommend this place.  I asked for scrambled eggs and got some sort of fried looking egg that was not close to scrambled. When I attempted to return it the server told me that is how they make egg whites.  Very strange.  The bathrooms are in need of repair and are not clean either."}
{"text":"Some of the best pancakes in the valley ... or anywhere, for that matter. Friendly service and affordable, too. One of my go-to breakfast spots and more than worth the 20-minute drive."}
{"text":"I had no idea such a place existed!! They have the BEST EVER homemade gluten free pancakes & waffles, and they also make all their own bread for French toast! I highly recommend it whether you're gluten free or not. The experience and customer service was exceptional! Thank you very much for your attention to detail with the flavor and texture.  That's hard to do with gluten free food.  We can't wait to come back!!!!!"}
{"text":"Omelet was thrown together & they were out of mushrooms & tomatoes at 10am on Sat.  Jelly was like glue.  Server was unpleasant like she didn't want to be there.
Will not return & shouldn't be a Groupon as their businesses are usually good quality."}
{"text":"Great place for breakfest. When I worked in the area, we would go there for a pancake lunch."}
{"text":"Anything on the menu is awesome. The baked pancakes and omelets are amazing.  I wake up on Sunday morning with a craving for JP Pancake.  I would suggest getting there before 10 am on the weekend. It is a store front restaurant with close tables and in my opinion, WONDERFUL wait staff. I have always found them to be friendly and accommodating. If you want to ditch the corporate breakfast joint and want really excellent pancakes, eggs and other wonderful items, this is the place. I think their pancakes are the best anywhere. A few small outdoor tables.  It is not open on Monday."}
{"text":"Didn't try the famous baked pancake, but the people at the next table had one... looked like an apple pie more than a pancake but smelled really good. The baked omelette was decent but a little dry and the eggs Benedict were good but not great. Friendly service and decent prices. Overall a good breakfast but not worth driving too far for."}
{"text":"I had never heard of this place until I saw the coupon in the 2013 Entertainment book. My husband and I went at 10 a.m. on a Saturday. It is a small place in a strip mall with fewer than 20 tables. The place opens at 7:30 a.m. There is a sign outside that says wait to be seated, so we stood there until someone came and opened the door. She said come on in and is this table ok. We said fine and she said what would you like to drink....before seating us or showing us a menu or anything. So we said orange juice, not realizing they charge $2.25 for an 8 oz. glass with no free refills. She said they just got a rush of people so the wait will be about 15 minutes. We told her about the coupon and she questioned the expiration date and I explained that the year is 2012 so it doesn't expire for a nearly a full year. Then we waited....

And waited. Meanwhile, everyone else appeared to be waiting too. Then a couple came in and waited by the door to be seated. When a server finally noticed them standing there, he said \"uh, I don't know where you're going to sit.\" and looked around in bewilderment. Another server came up and asked them to stand outside until a place opened up. The couple went outside, waited a minute, then just left. There were empty tables inside, but maybe the staff were waiting for larger parties to fill those seats. 

Our pancakes finally arrived, just 3 regular sized pancakes, which they charged $7.25 for. They were yummy, but it's pretty difficult to mess up basic pancakes anyway. They did accept the coupon finally and we ended up paying $13.62 for our pancakes and orange juice. I have never received such poor service at any restaurant before and will never be returning to JP Pancakes."}
{"text":"Do not, ever, go to this place. My friend and I were the only people in there (bad sign). Whoever the guy was that waited on us never even said good morning when we entered. The coffee had no taste whatsoever. If it had been a blind tasting, I would not have known it was coffee. The egg whites in my omelet were not completely cooked. The \"fresh\"  fruit that accompanied the omelet didn't look that fresh. I couldn't say for sure because, like the omelet, I didn't eat it.  I originally asked for home fries with my omelet, but was told it just came with fruit. My friend ate some of her blueberry pancakes. They were o.k. but not memorable. No care was taken with either the preparation or presentation of the food. This place should not be in business. We felt very uncomfortable there and couldn't wait to leave. We will not under any circumstances be back. When we got the bill, it looked as though the guy didn't charge me for the omelet. Nor should he have. Came home and fixed myself a nice piece of whole wheat toast and a decent cup of coffee in my Keurig."}
{"text":"Arrived there at Noon last week. The place was closed even though their sign says they are open until 1:00 PM.
They also had a sign on door stating they were no longer taking Entertainment Coupons.
The last time I was there they charged extra for \"real\" Maple syrup.. They were also out of waffle batter. Bacon was NOT crisp and well drained as requested.
Very disappointing. If you aren't very particular you might find it OK.
I will not be returning!
Too many other places with better attitude, service and quality of food etc."}
{"text":"I have been back a few times since my original review and have always had great service since, so I'm increasing my rating. Still in love with their oven bakes and crave them regularly. So delicious and worth the wait."}
{"text":"Good eats.  Small mom & pop setting, nothing fancy and it's great!  The oven baked pnackaes are worth the wait and the regular pancakes are awesome."}
{"text":"I went there for my first time today.  I've heard good things about JP Pancake, so I decided to check it out.  

I ordered an egg white omelette with vegetables and a side of buttermilk pancakes.  The omelette was terrible!  It was drenched in butter.  My omelette looked more like scrambled eggs sitting in melted butter.  I couldn't finish more than half.  The pancakes were pretty good, but nothing special.  My boyfriend ordered blueberry waffles and said they were decent.

I'm disappointed because I know a lot of people who really like this place.  Maybe I came on a bad day or something, but I don't plan on returning."}
{"text":"OK, I have to admit I'm having a hard time writing this review.  JP Pancake has been one of my family's favorites for years.  They have always been light on the service side but the amazing food made up for it and I always made sure to pack activities for the kids (they don't provide anything like other family restaurants do).
Unfortunately, the last several times we have dined here, the service has been absolutely atrocious!  In all fairness, the individuals working the front really are trying their best but it seems as though the owner has decided to cut costs by only providing one person to run the entire front area.  (Keep in mind, we eat breakfast out on Sunday mornings so we are talking the busiest weekend timeframe.)  It is literally impossible to run a restaurant with one person doing all the seating, bussing, orders, etc.  Granted it is a small restaurant but not that small.
Having said that, the food really is AMAZING!  My personal favorite is the blueberry pancakes with any of their omelettes coming in second.
Definitely worth a try - just make sure to come with lots of patience.  Your tummy will be rewarded."}
{"text":"Great breakfast! Had the blueberry pancakes and hubby had the baked blueberry pancake--both were amazing!! One nitpick-- bathrooms could have been a bit cleaner."}
{"text":"My favorite meal of the day is breakfast so I'm always on the lookout for new, LOCAL-owned restaurants opening as I'm always in the adventurous mood to try... well I saw this advertised on Groupon (although I didn't buy the coupon) I made not of this new establishment expanding to Mesa and couldn't wait to give it a try.
I was NOT disappointed!! The food was absolutely splendid and the breakfast potatoes are second to none... I could have had a plate of just these (unhealthy I know, but decadence... oh my!!)  The apple-smoked bacon was thick and cooked perfectly and the eggs were wonderful.  The highlight was the pancakes that my guest ordered and I had half... they were crisp on the outside and VERY soft on the inside... not quite sure how they griddle them this way, but I loved it.  Another stand-out is their coffee... in fact it was so good that it tasted like the beans had just been roasted in the kitchen... it was that FRESH!!  I asked the waitress about the coffee and she was so informative and told me it was Stella Bleu and that they get it freshly roasted every 3-4 days from a shoppe in Carefree... all I can say it was absolutely delicious and I'd go back just for the coffee and with the food being so great, it's a bonus!!
I have since gone to their Scottsdale location and the food was just as wonderful, in fact the owner is very hands on and actually personally hand-makes the bread items.  I can see from other reviewers that they don't like the ambiance and I can certainly understand it. The Mesa location is VERY hard to find and the restaurant is lay out / floorplan is odd & the Scottsdale location is in a strip mall and the owner definitely makes the most of the real estate space he is probably paying a fortune for, but once you try the food you really won't care...  upon reading the other reviews I decided to go at 12:30 on a Sunday and there were only 4-5 other couples / families there, so it wasn't overcrowded at all... so if space and privacy are important to you, just go at times that others won't.
The only other complaint (if that is even what you call it) is that they're only open until 1pm... wish they were open until 2:30 or 3pm... as I like to eat breakfast later in the day sometimes, but other than that... ANOTHER GREAT breakfast option / addition to the Arizona landscape!!"}
{"text":"It appears from the reviews I've read, you either love it or hate it. Personally, I would not wish to dine with those that rated JPs low.  My wife found this place online and we decided to try a new breakfast experience.  We had the buttermilk pancakes and sausage and we loved them!  We came back several times and noticed that the decor was changing and new personnel.  Vera had bought the restaurant and we feared it might change.  It changed, it got better!  We always seem to get pancakes, buttermilk and/or oven baked.  We are never disappointed.  The staff are helpful, efficient and the service is fast (oven baked does take longer).  Vera always has a smile and a remarkable memory, she remembers what you previously ordered.If something isn't right, let Vera know.  We have taken friends there, always an iffy proposition as we all don't have the same likes.  So far, it has been thumbs up all around!  Buttermilk pancakes, bacon and/or sausage, the best in town!"}
{"text":"Over priced and over attentive.  with only 2 other customers in the place on a saturday morning, the servers alternated asking if we were ready every 30 seconds.  Side order...1 piece of bacon for $1.50???  Are you serious?  Place is trying too hard to be a Portland like niche place.  No decor, over-priced and food was simply ok.  hey, if you are going to specialize in pancakes...how about a granola style???  no?  very popular at regular breakfast places...Guessing from the lack of customers I think they will be out of business before I find ANY urge to go back.  Fortunatley I had a coupon and did not have to pay FULL fare.  $24.50 was the full check for a burrito and an egg sandwich, coffee, juice and milk.  This isn't scottsdale...pass!"}
{"text":"You know it's bad when, after seating yourself, you hear what appears to be the only server apologizing to people for the wait for their food/drinks/checks.

I should've known, because I read the reviews prior to coming here, but was intrigued by the pictures on the window...(Too bad the food isn't as good as it looks!) Upon arriving at the restaurant, you're not greeted by anyone...it's \"seat yourself\" and there isn't a waiting area so you basically just walk into the restaurant and stand around looking for an open and hopefully clean table. I found one right by the front door and took a seat. The table next to me was covered in ketchup with broken pieces of glass all over the floor (and more ketchup). The girl at that table saw me looking and apologized for the mess...she said the server accidentally dropped the bottle on the table when bringing her food, but failed to come back and clean it up...or even apologize. So the girl had to eat her food with the ketchup all over the table...and now she had been waiting almost an hour for her check. I know that should've been my cue to leave, but I was meeting some friends there and figured I might as well just see how it went. It took almost 45 minutes for the waitress to come to our table and when she did she didn't offer drinks, just quickly asked us what we wanted to order and then walked off in the middle of the order. Then she came back and asked us to start over again. After ordering it took another 30-40 minutes to get our food, which was just ok...might have been better if it wasn't ice cold. A bit later the server returned and apologized for the wait and asked us what we wanted to drink??? After we already ate our food?? Strange....She then explained she was the only server working..on a Sunday morning during the busiest breakfast time...okayyyy. We asked for our bill, waited another 30 minutes to pay and quickly got out of there. That was 3 hours of our life pretty much wasted. I would've given 0 stars, but it wouldn't let me!"}
{"text":"My husband and I met my dad at JP this morning and found the place empty at 8. But the pancakes were excellent! The guys ordered the \"4x2\" and were warned that that was lots of pancakes (4 huge ones). They were hungry, though, and enjoyed every bite. My dad is gluten-intolerant so was very happy to have delicious, fluffy pancakes that he could eat, and didn't have to make himself. I'm sad that more people don't go there. It's tucked way back in the shopping center and might not get enough marketing. I'll definitely go back!"}
{"text":"Went there with a coupon from Living Social - love using coupons to try new places (new places to us anyways !).  We went in and right off the bat the place seemed disorganized - no-one greeted us, no sign to say seat yourself, so we hung around and eventually decided to seat ourselves.  Lots of tables were waiting to be cleaned up, so we had very little choice of where to actually sit.  On the way to sit down we overheard the waitress tell one of the tables that they were short staffed today.  We sat for over 10 minutes before anyone acknowledged us - we were on the verge of walking out.  We could see that one girl seemed to be working the tables and another guy seemed to be helping.  There were not that many tables, but still waiting 10 minutes to be acknowledged was a bit much.  We ordered drinks from the girl and then the guy took our food order.  We did enjoy our food, but it was not outstanding.  It did however, come out quickly.  The best thing we had were the chocolate chip pancakes - eggs, bacon and sausage were just OK.  Iced tea was not good.  During our time they did lose several customers who walked in and saw either tables taken or dirty and waiting to be cleaned and no-body greeting them so they just turned around and walked back out - not a good thing to happen as they will probably not be back.  For us, once we got our food after the initial long wait to order, it was good but not outstanding and since we live in old town not worth the drive for another try out - sorry."}
{"text":"We went to JP's for breakfast with a Groupon and  were shocked to find out that not only could we not use the Groupon to get burritos or omelets, but  there would be an 18% gratuity added to the bill.  I don't mind that places have restrictions but the management should make sure then they are listed, and i don't mean just on a sign at the establishment.  Now about the food, it was OK and i don't just mean for the price. As for the price, it is priced for the area  not for the quality.  As for the staff, they were OK but could benefit from watching  some episodes of Restaurant Impossible for some tips.  If you are in the mood for a place that is just average and don't have to travel far to get there, then don't hesitate to stop by this place."}
{"text":"I bought the groupon as many others have stated. I noticed when I printed out the groupon that over 1000 had purchased it and began to get nervous as this looked to be a small place- but I *love* breakfast so I went in hoping for the best.
I have tried 5 different times now to get in and get a table and every time has ended badly. I tried a Saturday at 8am and 10am both times I stood there for about 15 minutes before realizing that it wasnt going to happen within any amount of reasonable time, so I figured I'd try back on a different day and maybe it wouldnt be as crowded. 
I tried a Monday and a Wednesday as well, both with similiar results.

Now I dont mind if the place is going to be busy, as long as it looks like things are running smoothly and organized. Every time its a complete mess in there. Horribly disorganzied, tables sit empty for way too long before they realize they can seat people waiting. One guy is doing all the orders, and he's a mess, running around in circles. I don't mean he's not trying his best, but seriously, with that many people trying to eat, GET MORE HELP!

This is a complete mess- I will eat my groupon before trying to go back here.

{"text":"We received a coupon for this place and thought we'd give it a try this morning.  I think we caught them short handed as they had a single waitress that was obviously frazzled and doing her best to keep up with the rush.  It took quite a while to get our drinks (and the food).  Despite the fact that the service was slow, the food was very good.  I had the California omelette and my girls had the Chocolate Chip Pancakes and Strawberry Waffles.  Being the dad, I got to help them finish their food and it was tasty as well.  I'll go back again and give them another shot, but Beth needs to continue to improve her waitress skills if they want me as a regular."}
{"text":"Hands down this is the BEST breakfast place you will EVER eat at. My family and I eat at JPs at least once a week for breakfast. It is a very cute \"mom and pop\" type breakfast place with amazing pancakes. JP= Just Perfect Pancakes. They are super light and flavorful and they must have at least twenty different combos. The coffee is from a local brewery in Cave Creek and they are very child friendly. I would HIGHLY recommend this restaurant to anyone. :)

Be sure to wave to JP(actually his name is Chad) in the back cooking."}
{"text":"I don't eat breakfast often, but when I do, I like it to be large, filling, and cheap.  That being said, I was disappointed in JP for two reasons -  service and value.  Although the pancakes are excellent, the breakfasts are overpriced for what you get.  My bacon was undercooked, but the personable waitress volunteered to take the bacon and have it cooked some more.

Even with that, the service was terrible.   Once she served the customers, she would play cards with the cook. I had to remind her that she took my bacon to be recooked; and also had to ask for a refill on my coffee. I guess the card game was too fascinating!

Although this location is not far from where I live, I doubt I will be going back."}
{"text":"The house specialty is amazing nice and chewy on the inside and crispy on the outside. It is a great and friendly place. Service is great. I recommend to anyone to stop by and try the house specialty pancakes."}
{"text":"Menu says \"Oven baked pancakes are our specialty,\" so I tried one.  The orange-cranberry version.  It was absolutely inedible.  Nothing but a disc of barely-cooked batter literally floating in a pool of grease.  I was expecting a fluffy poof of German-influenced goodness, but what was served was a stunning disappointment.  To their credit, that item was removed from my check.
I should have known better than to even sit down:  when I walked in before 10am, the place was deserted.  A good breakfast place would have been bustling.
I will not be back."}
{"text":"Excellent Belgium waffles. They just opened, and my wife an I both enjoyed our breakfast very much. Not fancy -- just good food. We'll be back."}
{"text":"I would never go back here again. My husband, friend and I went after buying a Groupon and the place wasn't very crowded. The waitress took our order and said my husband couldn't substitute a Belgian waffle instead of pancakes with his omelette and then I was told they were out of home fries and it was only 10:30. She brings mine and my friend's food out and said she would bring silverware. Over 5 minutes later she brings the check and then my husband's food, still no silverware. I was pretty annoyed she brought the check before she had even served all our food. She said she would bring silverware then goes to take an order from another table, so we have to ask someone else. After finally getting some and being able to eat, I was really disappointed in the French toast. The bread was soggy and it had no flavor at all. The pancakes were ok, but nothing great. I was really disappointed and definitely would not recommend going here, not even with a coupon."}
{"text":"My wife and I showed up at 8am on a Saturday and only one other table was occupied. Other patrons started trickling in while we were there. The place is very casual, not much if any ambiance. The staff was very friendly. We both had oven baked pancakes, my wife the banana and I the German. Mine was very light, fluffy , and tasty. The banana was very sweet. The menu said oven baked pancakes would take at least 20 minutes. Ours arrived much sooner. 

Given the overall experience (food, price, setting), I give it 3 stars."}
{"text":"This place is CLOSED  on Sunday October 20. The phone number (both on Yelp and in the door ) isn't working and the inside looks empty."}
{"text":"I like the changes they've made to the inside decor. We enjoy JP's and they offer a very different and tasty pancake. The new menu is better in many ways. Yet they really overcharge for certain items. I wish they had a more price competitive menu or at least value for the portion. Coffee needs an upgrade, it's not good. Service is good."}
{"text":"JP'S has been our favorite pancake house since my son was dignosed with a severe gluten allergy.  For the last 3 years we have been loyal patrons and my son has never had an issue.  They were recently bought by new owners and though some great changes have been made decor wise, prices have increased in a ridiculous way!  I can't get out of there under $30 now for my 2 kiddos and I.  Everything is ala carte, eggs, sausage and syrup (if you want real maple).  So sad as it is the closest safe breakfast spot... guess we will be driving out to Jewels for breakfast!"}
{"text":"We stopped in here around opening time (8:30) and our waitress couldn't have been more pleasant. The place is in a small strip mall plaza. Atmosphere was great with the doors open, breeze blowing in, and great music playing in the restaurant. The food was excellent quality and there was no delay at all. The oven baked pancakes take about 20mins to bake and it came out as soon as it was ready. 
The price was a bit high for breakfast stuff (the coffee was $2.50/each). I think this should be listed as at least a $$ or higher on yelp, which is the only reason for not giving it 5 stars instead. Overall, an excellent breakfast while vacationing. 

The pictures are of the gluten free French toast and the caramel apple oven baked pancake."}
{"text":"I ordered a special item, banana bread French toast with a sausage, it was very good.  Service was good too.  We went at an off time during the week so it was not crowded at all."}
{"text":"Best pancakes ever! Light and slightly crispy. Worth a try."}
{"text":"I finally got around to trying this place a second time this week. The first time which was almost like more than a year ago, at that time I tried at that time their German pancake. It was kind of flat almost too light. It was too much eggs, that it gave almost a taste like a crepe than a pancake. It wasmy first German pancake here in Arizona and not many places have it on their menu and I have tried more and let me tell you now, not a real decent one out there in this area. 

This time I had another of their signature dish and that is the baked apple pancake or some times known as the dutch baby. This is also a very rare dish around Phoenix Metro area. That is why I came here, to try this dish out because it is a very impressive dish back in Chicago. Here I hate to say was a big disappointment. It is essentially the German Pancaked turned upside down with apples on top. Flat and not very filling. The one I had before, If I could finish 1/2 of it, I could not eat lunch that day. This one, was essentially like eating crepes, I gulped it down in about 10 minutes but could of have done it in 5 but was purposely slow playing it. The apples are too thinly sliced, not much caramel or cinnamon on top so it was barely light  brown on top. The real McCoy should look like 4 giant cinnabon stuck together. 

Okay, I should be realistic here, I have only tried 2  of the apple pancakes here in this area and both were about the same, so maybe it is interpretations. This one not being as impressive as the other, but as a pancake by itself is not that great either. It really had no great texture, more like a thick crepe than anything. I also did not try their regular pancake, but I figure, hey this is a pancake place, lets see what their best pancake is because everyone can do a chocolate chip or banana pancake.

 If I could give it a more detail rating, it would be 2.5 but 3 usually means that I would go back, which likely won't happen."}
{"text":"Enjoyed our bacon and pancakes. It was a weekend morning and was busy.  A comfortable environment very friendly and accommodating server and staff.  They even have things on a shelf for the kiddos to occupy themselves with while the food cooks. But the food was ready in a timely manner."}
{"text":"My husband and I each ordered an omelet with different fillings, his with side pancake and mine with hashbrowns and toast.  We also ordered an oven baked pancake to share since you can't go to a new restaurant and not try the signature item.  The omelets were small and flavorless.  The traditional pancake was nothing special (IHOP's are better). The hash browns were tasty.  The oven baked pancake was the best item by far, but still not outstanding.  The menu is very limited, which is not a problem, but if you have a small menu all your items should be excellent.  The restaurant is small, but doesn't feel cozy and warm.  It was eerily quiet and I could hear the wait staff complaining in the kitchen.  Unfortunately my first trip to JP pancake will be my last."}
{"text":"I'm so disappointed. This has been our favorite breakfast place for years. They used to have a reasonable amount of choices on their menu for vegetarians, including a great breakfast burrito. That option no longer exists with the advent of their new menu (they still offer non-vegetarian burritos), so I asked if the burrito could be made without meat. The cook said \"NO\". Why?? They would have come out ahead since the price was the same, and it would take the same effort and time to make the breakfast. Way to alienate a regular who now has no intention of returning. When a reasonable dietary request is made, why not grant it? 

The second star is for our waitress who really tried to help me, otherwise this would be a one star review. I have never left a review on Yelp before--that's how strongly I feel about the change in atmosphere at JP's. They say the management is the same, so I have no idea what happened to this place."}
{"text":"I've been coming here for the past year, and it's hands down the best breakfast place in town. I have never came here and been disappointed. Service is great and personable."}
{"text":"I went there on 9.11.2011 to redeem a groupon.  Although my meal was discounted by half, it was still a terrible value. 

The place was dirty. The coffee was the most watered down, poorest tasting cup of joe I've ever had.  The coffee pot looked like it hadn't been washed in years.

I ordered pancakes and eggs scrambled well. Like other YELP writers, my eggs were runny on the inside. The pancakes were limp and mediocre, especially for a place that hangs their hat on their pancakes. 

I treat every meal like it's my last. If you value the experience of every meal you eat, you'll avoid this place like a 20-car pile-up on the I-10.  Best to go somewhere clean and consistent, like US Egg, Orig Pancake House, Cafe Zuzu, Dick's Hideaway or Herb Box."}
{"text":"I never go out to breakfast, however I will make a point come here. I have never been disappointed. The ambiance is not the best - but the food is great. Service is good being that there are only two servers. I've never had to wait for food or drinks. Only had to wait in line once and I only go on the weekends. Blueberry pancakes are heaven - melt in your mouth - no butter or syrup needed."}
{"text":"My girlfriend has celiac and a very pronounced sweet tooth. I was very happy to find a local breakfast place that took making gluten free breakfast seriously."}
{"text":"Thank you to the 3 big name chain breakfast spots for being over crowded. Without you I would have never been forced to 'Yelp' other places. With that said - this is definitely a true hidden gem. How this restaurant hasn't grown larger than Costco is beyond me. 
Arrived around 11:30- greeted promptly and served with a friendly and helpful attitude. We ordered the Belgium waffle with strawberries and sausage As well as the biscuits and gravy. Wish I would have ordered double it was just that good. I can't wait I return and have 1 of everything!"}
{"text":"So happy I found this place!!! I appreciate the little things like HOT eggs. (Amazing how difficult that can be it seems at other places). I've got a healthy appetite and here I won't break the bank. Great options and always friendly and attentive service. Always look forward to my visit. I've been to probably every breakfast spot in the area and JP is my fav."}
{"text":"Decent for the price. Used a \"Living Social\" discount so I pair $10.67 for the two of us for breakfast.  Kind of \" mom & pop\" like. I had French toast and it was very ordinary. Daughter ate belgian waffles with fresh strawberries, no big deal. Portions were average."}
{"text":"OMG!  This place is fantastic!  Little tiny restaurant with BIG TASTES! The staff is always friendly and they help each other out with tables.  I personally LOVE LOVE LOVE the baked apple pancake, but my sister prefers blueberry.  If you get the baked pancake, be prepared to wait (it's worth it!) and don't bother ordering any sides.  You won't need/want them after you try the pancake!"}
{"text":"My pancakes had pockets of flour in them. Not scratch, just a mix. One star for service. That's it. Won't be back.  Yeplers, 3.5 stars? Really?  You guys burnt me on this one."}
{"text":"This is by far the best breakfast place I've been to in a very long time. The Carmel Apple baked pancake is the best thing I've tasted in eons.  I highly recommended this place!!"}
{"text":"Took my mom here for something different. What fun the oven baked pancakes were heaven. Loved the service and the food"}
{"text":"Tried it out. The doors were opened for fresh outdoor air. I thought that would automatically mean there would be insects in the restaurant but we never saw any."}
{"text":"I really like this breakfast spot and frequent it as often as I can considering I don't live on that side of town.

The pancake batter and homemade wheat bread are a recipe from who I assume is the owner. Our waiter pointed her out to us but she was walking around cleaning up tables, etc. Whoever she is, her recipes are delicious.

For the cheaper/lighter side, I recommend the Sunshine Combo. Either side you choose will do. The sausages are HUGE here. I saw them served to someone else. I'm normally a bacon girl but may change that next time I go to JP Pancake. Yum. 

Today I had the build-your-own omelette with mushrooms, spinach, avocado and chorizo. I was thinking I was taking a chance with the chorizo but it was so flavorful and the perfect amount of food. Their home fries are also to die for so whatever side you choose is great.

The only thing lacking today was the service, and that's why it got four stars. 

We had to wait 10-15 minutes to be seated when they said it would only take 5. The waiter took forever to come greet us. I understand he's the only waiter serving a restaurant full of people but he never asked us how everything was. They were also out of strawberry jam for the person I got breakfast with. It was okay for me because I like grape jelly. It took forever for our food to come out, but the check was quickly placed on our table only minutes after we got our food. I hate when they rush you like that."}
{"text":"I was so disappointed in this place. Really sad about my experience here. I find that in Gilbert its pretty hard to find a locally owned place. Lots of chains around here. So I was pretty excited to see how JP was. There wasnt a sole in sight was we came in around 10am and the waiter looked like he didnt know where he was, very quiet. We sat and took a look at the menu, mostly typical breakfast stuff. Pancakes and eggs. I ordered the Banana Chocolate Chip Pancakes and my breakfast partner ordered the French Toast Combo. Food was fast about 10 min. Pancakes were average at best. Def tasted like a mix instead of homemade. However, my buddies food was terrible. He insisted that the french toast was frozen and bacon and eggs were not even edible! Thats pretty bad if he couldnt get through the bacon. We sadly will not be returning. I hate to write a not so good review about a local spot. Get it together JP. Prices were a little high as well."}
{"text":"We love JP Pancake. Not only are they very friendly for people with gluten sensitivity/allergies, but the service is always stellar.  Everything we have tried is delicious. My go to breakfast is the Pigs in a Blanket plate and my husband usually goes with the gluten free french toast (the banana bread french toast is exceptional).  We HIGHLY recommend.  I would give more than 5 stars if i could."}
{"text":"food is tasty. 

server was creepy. i'm pretty sure he was making fun of the way i spoke. RUDE. =/

i won't be back,"}
{"text":"The oven baked pancakes are insanely good. I want to go back and try all the different flavors at some point. You'll want to do the same once you've tried it. Trust. This place is known for their pancakes so make sure that is what you get. Everything else is pretty decent making the pancakes the bigger star of the show here.

My fiance and I decided to have our Sunday Brunch Day here since I had a LivingSocial deal that I needed to use. We arrived just before 10am and the place was busy. It's small in size so it feels even more crowded than it really is. The downside was the wait to be seated and have our orders taken which took quite a bit of time. But note that this is not because the staff was not hustling - they were - but the place was full and there was only one girl serving as hostess, waitress and busser all in one. We weren't surprised when it took awhile to be seated, to get our drinks and to order our food. But hey, I can't be mad at her since she was trying. Not her fault that there wasn't additional staff to help. 

Ultimately, we got our food order in and we were prepared to wait a little while longer because the oven baked pancakes are noted to take 20 minutes preparation. We ordered one pancake each - orange cranberry for me and banana for him. We added a side of bacon, two eggs and potatoes for us to share. We LOVED our pancakes and ate every bite. The eggs were a bit runny and undercooked for me but not something that would ruin our meal. The bacon and potatoes were decent - nothing special - but a good complement to our sweet pancakes.

So yes, service was slow but not unpleasant. Perhaps we'll try going at a different time when it's not peak weekend brunch hour but, even then, if we feel like one of their oven baked pancakes I'm pretty sure we'll brave the full house again if we need to. It's totally worth it."}
{"text":"This place was really hard to access by wheelchair. I noticed the inside was not the most appealing. The art work on the walls where nice and painted by the cook we had . The reason I found out it was his paintings is when I was pushing my grandpa out to the car he gave my girlfriend a card and told her he liked the way she handled herself and had a job for her. Come to find out he is an artist and wanted my girlfriend to call him which was not cool of him and can only imagine what kind of work he had for her. The baked pancakes where good but got really doughy. All the other food was average. I don't think I will be coming back here again after my girlfriend was uncomfortable with her experience."}
{"text":"We decided to try this place when the line was wrap around the building at Butterfield's.  It was a pleasant surprise.  We have three small children and I would say it is very family friendly!  They have  a wide variety of pancakes and omelets with some very interesting flavors for pancakes.  I had the orange poppyseed and they were fantastic.  My husband said he would go back  just for the breakfast potatoes.  The prices are reasonable but not cheap."}
{"text":"Went there for the first time on Saturday and was SUPER impressed! My mom and son are both gluten free and JP Pancake has tons of options for them and they both agree that it tastes good - which is no small feat for cooking gluten free! I had bacon and eggs and their biscuits and gravy - YUMMY! We'll for sure be back and the next time I'll remember to try to the pancakes lol"}
{"text":"Can't stress enough what a delight it was to eat here! So nice to have a change from the run of the mill breakfast places! The oven baked pancakes are AMAZING. I make German pancakes at home (recipe handed down from my very German G'ma) and the pancakes here are just as good! Oh and did I mention .. Small, family owned business!!  The service was GREAT TOO !! Doesn't get any better than this !! Try this place .... You will not be disappointed !!"}
{"text":"This is a small, family owned restaurant. They have a ton of Gluten Free options and they handle the GF food with care to prevent cross contamination. The owner and staff are super sweet and they have THE BEST banana bread French toast. It is my favorite breakfast spot in town actually. My friends and I come here every Sunday for brunch before work. I would definitely recommend this place."}
{"text":"I am a nice person, and I prefer writing good reviews, and rarely want to leave something negative. But I gotta say, I've been here twice - with a good enough span of time in between both times, and I've been disappointed twice now. Actually, I attempted a third time in between the two different instances and was turned away - never have I been turned away by a small business. This was close to closing time, but still before, and though normally I would not want to keep people, I figured a small business such as JP Pancake could use the patronage.

At any rate - the last time I went, I ordered french toast - and what I got, I could have made better myself at home. Two tiny, flat pieces of toast, with hardly any flavor and forget presentation. Service was poor as the people waiting and cooking were unattentive and slow - not just to us but in terms of cleaning the tables of patrons who had already left. We walked in and it was litterally, find a table that wasn't strewn with dirty plates and glasses. It was not a pleasant site. And, just as we had been turned away the previous time we had attempted to visit this establishment, we watched them turn away an elderly man about 15 minutes to close.

It was just a bummer - I'm not sure who enjoys this place when literally right down the street is a fantastic breakfast place over and Hayden and Via de Ventura.

To break it down, I would not visit them again. They were:
- rude
- unattentive
- slow
- messy/dirty
- poor tasting food
- poor presentation"}
{"text":"I ordered the Apple Oven Baked Pancake.  I was really really hoping to be wow-ed.  I was mediocre-d.  The service was really great and the waitress super polite.  Liked the feel of a mom and pop shop, but a little disappointed with the overall taste of the food.  I will try again and order a different oven baked pancake."}
{"text":"I try and eat here as often as I can. The food is fantastic and the wait staff is excellent. They are a small business that I am proud to support."}
{"text":"I went here with my fianc√© and had the worst dining experience ever. In fact we had to go somewhere else to get a drink to wash it down because we both felt sick after.  I had gluten free pancakes and he had French toast with eggs and bacon.  The pancakes tasted like butter, tap water and soap.  By far the worst food I have eve eaten.  The horrible aftertaste wad even worse.  The scrambled eggs tasted like chlorine , and how do you mess up bacon??! There were no people there, which should have tipped us off, the floor, table an chairs were sticky and gross an we had to ask for new glasses because our cups were visibly dirty.  The new ones tasted like soap.  We barely ate any of the food even though we were starving, and then that crap cost us $25! I will never go back here!! And I would give it negative 5 stars if I could."}
{"text":"Well it's taken us long enough to try this place out. We have no excuse, we live around here. 

JP Pancakes did not disappoint! The service was fine, though the waiter was a little quirky and harried. He says they were unexpectedly busy on a Thursday. 

Busy or not, the kitchen must be running just fine! The food was delicious! My daughter had the nutty, banana, Belgian waffle and I had the strawberries and cream one, and we shared a side of eggs and hash browns. Very, very satisfying!

Did you know they make oven-baked pancakes? Never heard of that before. We will definitely come back to try them. We would have this visit but we were in a hurry and it takes a minimum of 20 minutes for that order. So keep that in mind.

Overall we felt comfortable here, enjoyed the food, were satisfied with the service, and will be returning soon!"}
{"text":"Great breakfast place small simple menu big portion fresh homemade breakfast. Good prices too. Would recommend this place will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Had a wonderful apple pancake this A.M.  Not only was it tasty, fresh and hot and served by Tracey with a smile, my coffee cup was never on empty, always was full and brewed just right.  You can't beat that and sure got my day off to a good start!  My husband had pancakes and eggs and was equally pleased.  Thanks J.P. Pancake for making our first visit enjoyable.  We will be back!
Mary M."}
{"text":"I felt this place was overrated and pricey for the amount of food you get. The restaurant was somewhat clean and simple (tables were clean but I almost tripped a couple of times because my flip-flops kept sticking to the floor). The waitress was very nice (there was only one).

Famous oven baked pancake: I got the banana and added nuts ~$8.50 + $1.50 for nuts
My mom got 1 egg, 1 (very crispy) bacon and 1 pancake: $5.95
Kids meal $3.50 (??).

With that said, this place was NOT my style and I would definitely not return or recommend it to anyone...maybe just to try the oven baked pancake just to cross it off your bucket list."}
{"text":"Good service, but the food is ok at best. Kelly loved the pancakes and that's the reason for the 3 star vs my 1 star opinion! We will not be returning here and should in no way reflect the level of service we were given. Only thing positive for me was there was no wait to sit on a Sunday, but that too now is saying a lot about the food here."}
{"text":"Home of the world famous oven baked pancake! Basically a half baked stack of pancakes with gooey doughey insides. Imagine funnel cake, but doughy-er. We got the banana nut pancake with chocolate chips on top. Be prepared for a sugar overload!

A small, no frills breakfast joint serving up your standard fare of breakfast items. I liked that they put little board games at each table, to entertain you while you wait. Super casual, friendly staff."}
{"text":"This place is closed, I just got here and there's a sign posted out front saying sorry, closed for business, like forever"}
{"text":"Thought we would try a new breakfast place and after checking Yelp near our house JP Pancake popped up.  We saw more negative than positive reviews so initially passed; however, our normal place was really busy so thought it would be fun to try something new.  Went into it with low expectations and have to say was pleasantly surprised.  

Decor is fun, simple and feels very family owned (which is a good thing).  Waitress (good customer service) recommended we try the oven baked pancakes.  We had our kids with us so she kindly let us know it takes 20 minutes to bake.  If you are in a rush or have crazy kids with you (as we did) make sure you order the baked pancakes as soon as you arrive.  We went with the apple pancakes and they were REALLY good.

We would have given JP Pancakes a 4 star due to the apple baked pancakes; however, some of the other menu items we tried were not as good.  The home fries were fine just a little too oily and needed seasoning.  My kids had a gallon of syrup (just because they like to make their parents super nuts when hopped up on sugar) with a side of pancakes, sausage, and bacon.  They said they liked it so that is good as they are somewhat breakfast snobs.  The kids menu had good choices and prices were fair ($3/order).

If you are up for trying a unique baked pancake experience give JP's a try."}
{"text":"service was very slow and it wasn't that busy. I had an omelette it was ok but the single piece of toast was dry and over toasted, my friend had pancakes and loved them.
Groupon made it better"}
{"text":"Servings were huge! One of the bests breakfasts I've had in a long time.  Looking forward to trying some of the other German pancake selections..."}
{"text":"This place is yummy. You get great service and the food is in large portions.  Only down is I didn't know how to check in. So when you go sign the book on top of the candy machine. They are busy but worth the wait!"}
{"text":"My friend and I were looking for a place to eat breakfast on Sunday morning. Every place we saw had lines and we didn't really want to wait. Using Yelp we found this place and are we glad we did! 

The place was full but had a few empty seats. We were seated and got menus. I ordered the traditional breakfast and my friend got biscuits and sausage gravy. I ordered a side of pancakes not knowing how big their servings are. They are big! I had leftovers. But most important the food was great! My was delicious and so was my friend's. 

Service was good as well. Despite being busy our server checked on us regularly and filled our drinks. 

I will definitely be going back when I'm in the area."}
{"text":"Food was great. Waitress was clueless.  Brought the 2 pancake order instead of three, then gave a lame excuse."}
{"text":"My sister and I are always trying out places near our home and we loved this place. A mom and pop restaurant, single server working. He was friendly quick and has his art posted around the establishment. It brings an updated look to the usual country store ambiance of many breakfast places we've been to. 

We both loved what we ordered, I had a build your own omelette (chorizo, green peppers, mushrooms, cheddar jack cheese) I also substituted for egg whites which usually I find somewhat sacrifice flavor, but not this time. The omelette had full zest. I also chose their home fries with saut√©ed green peppers and onions which were just as tasty. The entree also came with a choice of toast (I used a slice to put a bit of my omelette in). My sister ordered a BYO potato and egg burrito, she's not much for veggies so hers was with chorizo, chicken, ham, and cheddar jack. Also phenomenal, served with fresh fruit. 

According to the menu they are known for their pancakes so she ordered one of those as well, super delicious. Moist and fluffy, served with maple syrup. We wanted to try one of their baked pancakes, but were limited on time. We will be returning and can try those next!"}
{"text":"Wow. Just stopped in to check and see what others were saying and I'm surprised.

We still go here once or twice a month. I'm not an owner, nor do I know anyone personally that works there. We just like it. I guess maybe it has to do with the fact that we do tend to go around 730 in the morning, before the rush.

We usually get coffee or cocoa and waters, so no idea what the issue is with the glasses. The coffee is yummy. The manager (owner?) was telling another table that it's roasted up in Cave Creek just for them, last time we were there. 

I've never had the waffle, but I did get the crusted french toast once, and it had a LOT of nuts, strawberries and banana's on it.... Normally we just get the Sunshine Breakfast with an upgrade on the pancakes to one of the \"special\" flavors for $1.50 or so addt'l.... Guess I'll stay away from the waffles. lol"}
{"text":"I had the Orange Cranberry baked pancake. It was great. My wife had the blueberry waffles. They were great too. Lots of flavor! Going back again tomorrow...The place is very casual, seat yourself, etc. Service was friendly and good."}
{"text":"The food was excellent with large portions. I ate most of the banana pancake by myself. My Husband enjoyed the skillet as well. The waiter was super friendly!"}
{"text":"Went there Easter Sunday, today, had the baked apple pancake and my wife had the orange cranberry baked pancake. Both were great. We have a new favorite breakfast place."}
{"text":"It is our fourth time enjoying some of baked pancake goodness here at JP Pancake.
This place is not for carb-conscious, or healthnuts. However, if you are just like us who enjoys healthy living five days a week, and the remaining two days we eat like normal american diet which includes treats like this (or kronuts)! ^_^

Price is average. 
Portion for the most part will fill a couple of diners in their \"free what you fancy eating\" day. 
Location is fairly easy to spot.
Service is warm and friendly.

We'll definitely pop by here again! *nom nom nom*"}
{"text":"Walking in, seems like a simple strip mall type of restaurant, but it is so much more!  Everything is made from scratch. Best pancake ever!  Made to order - huge, big enough to share but you might not want to, so delicious!  Coffee is bottomless cup and servers are fantastic. You will be happy you stopped in. Prices are great as well. This was a great experience"}
{"text":"JP Pancake has the ambiance of about 3.5 stars but the food and service were 4.5 stars! I had the biscuits and gravy which were scrumptious! And my date had a vegan omelette and the orange cranberry pancakes; she said the pancakes were out of this world!!!"}
{"text":"It's kinda hard to screw up pancakes but I heard this place was good so I went and tried it. The place is basic as far as decor goes. We didn't have to wait which was nice. Some of the yelp reviews said that there can be long lines which is understandable since the place is small. My table was pretty sticky even though it had clearly been wiped down so lost a few points there. Heard great things about the oven baked pancakes but was in a hurry so I'll have to try them next time. Didn't want to order a basic pancake so I planned to order some French toast. Just as I was about to order I noticed that the special was Banana Bread French Toast. It sounded interesting and I had to give it a try. It was different but it was delicious. Three slices of fresh banana bread cooked like French toast then served with whipped cream and sliced almonds. Was really good! Prices are good as well. I will return to try the oven baked pancakes."}
{"text":"Really surprised to see this place have this many stars.

My family & I went here on 12/18/16 for brunch after church. When we walked in I was surprised to see only 2 other couples in the restaurant. 

First impressions of the dining area were that the decor that they were going for was a low budget farmhouse chic. I didn't have a problem with it, what did bother me was that the tables and chairs were wiped down but didn't look or feel clean and the banquettes were old and not sturdy. We stood by the door for about a minute before a server who wasn't very welcoming told us to just sit anywhere. We did and he brought us our menus.
After looking over the menu I couldn't believe that they were charging 7.75 for a breakfast burrito that included just the tortilla, eggs & potatoes. If you want to add any other ingredients it was additional charge of 50¬¢- $1 per item. I ended up adding bacon, onions, mushrooms & cheddar. My wife ordered the Belgian waffle along with a couple of eggs. She asked for them to be basted and the waitress said they can't make them that way. Really? If you can make sunny side up the change to basted is just adding a splash of water and covering it with a lid. So she asked for sunny side up instead. The kids got a side of bacon & silver dollar pancakes.
 We waited about 25 minutes for our food after placing the order. 
When we finally got the order my wife's waffle was placed in front of her obviously burnt. I can maybe understand the cook letting that slide but the server should've caught that. We also received a side of attitude when we asked for a new waffle.
 My $9 breakfast burrito was dry and flavorless. I ended up picking out the bacon and just ate that along with my buttermilk pancakes which were decent. 
 Don't think we'll give this place another shot."}
{"text":"The food we ordered was average at best. It wasn't bad, but like many have said, it wasn't anything that you couldn't make at home. Seriously. 

I did order their signature item, the baked pancake, and I liked it, but not enough for it to be the only thing I come back for. 

In order for me to go back the next time I visit AZ 2 things would need to happen: 
1. The food would need to get way better.
And 
2. The portions a little larger. 

I enjoy going to non-chains places when it's worth it. This isn't.

My BF and I ordered an omelet with a waffle and home fries. When we ordered the waiter(the Dwight Schrut looking guy everybody mentions) acted like we were ordering some giant feast. I also ordered the baked pancake. My dad ordered the pigs in a blanket and his GF ordered the French toast. The waiter had the nerve to tell my dad \"thanks for keeping it simple\" after my bf and I ordered what I guess he thought was too extensive. 

The French toast plate was 2 triangles of nothing special French toast and some eggs. 

My dads plate was to hot dog size sausages wrapped in 2 small pancakes(nothing on the side). 

My bf and my order was just as small. Our omelet was the size of half a small omelet pan, the waffle was the size of 2 eggos, and the side of potatoes was silly. It was like the size of a bread plate. So odd that the waiter would comment that we were ordering \"a buffet\" and then trot out snacks for a tea party. 

My BF and I don't weigh 300 lbs or anything and it wasn't like we were too disappointed about the size of the portions, but just felt the waiter needed to keep his comments to himself. 

The baked pancake was enough for 3 people, though. I only ate a bit of it b/c I wanted to at least try what they are known for. 

So, if you are too lazy to cook at home but want the same taste go ahead and go here. Be prepared to be insulted, though."}
{"text":"Came right in and was seated right away with no wait on a Sunday around 11 am. The baked Caramel apple pancake was delicious and well worth the 20 min wait. Great service. Recommend you give them a try."}
{"text":"I've been to JP Pancake 4-5 times now, so as you can tell I must really like it. 

The baked pancakes are amazing. Once you try them you'll never want anything else for breakfast. I've tried the cranberry orange, pineapple orange, banana honey, and raspberry cream cheese. Every time the pancakes delight. I've recommended the baked pancakes to friends who after trying them become regulars for breakfast the also.

Do yourself a favor. Go to JP Pancake asap for breakfast, get a baked pancake... And you'll never want anything else"}
{"text":"A little over priced but WAY GOOD!! Truly a top notch, quality meal. Best pancakes around"}
{"text":"I really liked the food here I like that they had an option for gluten-free. My son loves the pancakes here as well. The service was just OK nothing to brag about on the service. However it's worth going there for the food. They were a little on the pricey side and seemed to charge an extra fee for every single thing that you get so I didn't like that part."}
{"text":"Stopped by for breakfast - husband said the pancakes were the best he ever had. I had biscuits and gravy. Nice to have real sausage gravy for a change. Az places who do it right are few and far between! Will be back."}
{"text":"My family has been coming here for about a year.  They recognize us and are so friendly.  The food is always wonderful!  They have gluten-free options, also, that are amazing!!!  We love this place!"}
{"text":"This is a very quite little place, there were maybe only 3 other people in the restaurant when we came in for breakfast. The service was pretty good, the only guy working there was a bit quite but very helpful. I have a gluten/wheat allergy and I was able to choose from many different options (which is very rare!). I ordered an omelet with potatoes and one gluten free pancake- everything was delicious! The gluten free pancake was probably the best I've ever had. This is a great little place and I will definitely be back the next time I am visiting AZ."}
{"text":"Amazing German pancake! Let it settle and enjoy all the flavors they have. Everything is enjoyable on their menu."}
{"text":"I would like to endorse JP Pancake. I ate breakfast food for lunch. I am not whistling Dixie when I say, those were the best pancakes I've ever had at any restaurant. Check it out.

Friendly staff.  Clean and tidy."}
{"text":"I was in the area and I remember I used to go to this place about  5 years ago.  It was blah.  Nothing special.  There was only one waitress for a Saturday morning crowd.  That should have been my first clue.  She was nice enough, but it was still early.  There were only 4 tables with patrons, so I think she was managing.  I had the french toast, what can I say, it didn't taste like challah dipped in the egg mixture as they claim.  Not bad, but it was your run of the mill dinner french toast.  Usually when I am going to blow my calorie budget, I want it to be worth it. Now I just feel guilty and want to hit the treadmill.  I know I won't be coming back with the twins either, because the couple that came in while I was finishing my breakfast requested a high chair and the waitress told them all the straps in the high chairs where broken.   I need to make sure I keep my little rug-rats strapped if we don't want chaos."}
{"text":"This place was as good as advertised! If you don't order a baked pancake, you are missing out. Tried the banana pancake, and it was delicious. They also have awesome potatoes and the toast tasted like homemade bread. Definitely a place worth trying!"}
{"text":"The banana-nut oven baked pancake was like nothing I have ever tried before....awesome.  The problem is, you only get one and they aren't filling enough to be the one and only thing a person eats for breakfast.  Just one skinny pancake a little smaller than a dinner plate? for $8.00? That's it? So I ordered a side of eggs  ($2.00).  Next time I'll go somewhere else.

My boyfriend hated his Waffles.  He said:  \"an Eggo is about the same size and would have tasted better\".  He also had to pay extra for 2 eggs and 2 strips of bacon (more like 1 strip broken in half).  

We spent over $38.00 (including a tip for the nice waitress) for our breakfast. FOR BREAKFAST.  My pancake might have been impressive and different, but it ain't worth that...It's worth 2 stars instead of the 0 stars this place would get otherwise."}
{"text":"Amazing service! Alex is a Rock star! Love the baked pancakes. We enjoined the freshest wild Maine blueberry option, not to sweet, just right.    A must stop!"}
{"text":"Also bought the Groupon and I loved the place. It's every bit as good as Butterfields, but without the noise and the 45 minute wait. I got an oven-baked peach pancake and it was amazing. My only criticism is that they only give you those little preservative creamer thimbles instead of fresh half and half. Everything else is awesome though. My boyfriend and I thought it was so good we went back again and will definitely keep coming back."}
{"text":"Update: when you ask if the chicken in the omelette is white meat and they tell you it is....And this is what you get. Bugs me that the waitress never asked if everything was okay either. 

I would drop them 2 stars but my husband loves their pancakes too much. Irritated me to pay extra for something I didn't order. #gross"}
{"text":"Not sure why all the great reviews on this one.  Went in and ordered a pancake and some biscuits and gravy.  This business needs a lesson on prompt service.  It took about 30 minutes to get our food, they brought out the wrong order initially, the food was not that great and as I left I noticed that 80% of the people seated who were either there before I arrived or came shortly after I did, none of them had received their food yet.  The table next to me got their order but it was all wrong.  There were no apologies for the wait either.  First impressions are everything in this kind of business, mine was not good so I won't be back.  Too bad too, we go out to breakfast every weekend and would have been back had the first experience been stellar."}
{"text":"After hearing some good things,  I decided to take my kids for breakfast.  As stated,  slow service and food was ok. Nothing to write home about. Wish I could've given  a local business a better review but it was a stretch at 3 stars."}
{"text":"Worst breakfast I have ever had!!!
40 minute wait to take our order. Then the bacon was undercooked, my scrambled eggs were fried eggs they chopped up, and the Belgian waffle was a thin little waffle I could have made better at home. The syrup was super sticky sweet, too. I could not eat most of my meal.  I was home not 5 minutes before I got violently sick. I'm calling the health department on the morning."}
{"text":"I get the distinct feeling that the management and employees of JP Pancake just enjoy saying \"No.\"  I had a Groupon a while back and it had expired.  Everyone knows you're supposed to still get the face value of the voucher taken off your bill.  Well... at JP Pancake they just give you half the face value off.  Groupon ended up giving me a full refund so I actually came out ahead.

They could not be less accommodating.  You have to pay extra for fruit as a side, even when they're out of everything else you'd potentially want.  Two stars for the food, I guess...They do have good baked pancakes, which you won't find everywhere, but I'm more of an egg person anyway.  

Oh and they just started their \"summer hours\" and they don't serve lunch in the summer, despite the fact that there's an entire page of lunch items still on the menu.  Perhaps they should get a summer menu, but that would just rob them of many opportunities to say No to people.

The atmosphere is pretty bad too.  If you can't get a table, you have to wait outside in the heat, because the dining tables take up the whole inside.  My turn to say No."}
{"text":"I stopped in this morning after hearing how great the baked pancakes were but saw that there was a 20-minute wait for them well my blood sugar was dropping quickly and I ordered something that would be a lot quicker however after 15 minutes the waitress comes and says that she lost my ticket and never ordered my food I had to run across the parking lot to Taco Bell and eat something to get rid of the shakes. This is the kind of thing that should never happen at a restaurant"}
{"text":"After just moving here, I've been searching for \"my breakfast place\", one that is locally owned and has personality.  I so wanted JP's to be that place, but only found ultra-average eats instead.  I had an omelet, whole wheat toast and home fried potatoes.  The potatoes were terrific!  The omelette was supposed to be oven baked, which makes them rise and usually makes them super tasty with a little crunch to the edges.  No such thing here; I simply can't believe mine saw anything but the omelette pan.  It didn't even look like it contained the advertised 3 eggs.  Maybe 3 quail eggs!!  Very, very average.  Toast was toast, and it was even delivered late.  I had hoped for better!"}
{"text":"If you love pancakes then this place rules.  I had their house specialty baked apple pancake. Super good. My boyfriend had the regular pancakes with scrambled eggs and bacon. The pancakes were homestyle and very good and bacon was crisp and thick. Eggs had no flavor at all and had a weird texture.  Over all the service and food were good."}
{"text":"Great breakfast joint!! Friendly staff... Best pancakes I have found in the valley!!
Cool local art for sale on the walls.
I dont mind making the drive from old town for this breakfast!!"}
{"text":"Food- always fresh and delicious.

Service- friendly and relatively fast, but 1 server on a Sunday morning(?!), yikes. 

Price- a little pricey for breakfast fare, but not crazy. 

Overall- a small hole in the wall breakfast joint w/ some decadent pancakes/waffles/frenchtoast, that's worth trying."}
{"text":"Very sweet neighborhood joint. Servers are kind, and the portions are gigantic! Their oven baked pancakes are to die for. Cute and cozy."}
{"text":"This place has awesome funny service if you become a regular here they will def remember you. Very attentive. great food. Very fast. Very small but very cozy to me. French toast is amazing. I am very picky about french toast too."}
{"text":"Simply awesome and so very friendly! I am gluten free and ordered their French toast. Very moist and had cinnamon flavor. They also brought out a gluten free pancake for me to try since it was our first trip their. Everything was excellent. All staff very attentive, friendly and on top of everything ( refreshing coffee removing plates ect). Will definitely return."}
{"text":"Just plain GREAT!!! Impressed by the biscuits & gravy with true flavor & sausage bits. The pancakes are delicious with no need for syrup or butter. Just suuper good. The description of the 'plump' sausage is spot on and does not disappoint. Will absolutely return and try the German pancakes. Waay recommend and Lee was faaabulous!!! My plate came exactly how I wanted it!!!"}
{"text":"Service was quick and the food was great, we tried the baked pancake and it wasn't our favorite but it was different, nothing at all wrong with it just not our taste. The regular pancakes and breakfast were great! Nice friendly and cozy place."}
{"text":"super tasty breakfast with excellent and friendly service!
we split the egg white omelet (which came with homemade wheat bread-fantastic!), the cranberry-orange pancake bake and the special raspberry-cream cheese pancake bake - everything was amazing!! especially the bakes. you most definitely need to get one when you come here!"}
{"text":"I took almost an hour to get our food. Our server barely talked to us. The food was good but not worth the wait. The women's restroom was unusable. I was disappointed over all."}
{"text":"Amazing food and staff. The baked pancakes are beyond amazing!   Came highly recommended and we were not disappointed!  We have been back twice and both time amazing food and super friendly staff."}
{"text":"Neat little breakfast place. The pancakes were, in fact, just perfect!"}
{"text":"Took my family there for breakfast and it was great. The portions are very large, we all had to get take home boxes! I ordered the french toast with banana  and home fries, absolutely great! It was truly french toast! Very thick almost like chunks of cakes, very fresh and light and airy. Definitely not the french toast you get in other places! We enjoyed our breakfast there. We were in and out, it did not take forever for us to get our food. Good service, great little joint. Highly recommend it!!!!"}
{"text":"My fianc√© and I have been here many times and we LOVE it! We've recommended to all of our family and friends! Its definitely our favorite breakfast joint to go to on our off days I've tried different things off the menu each time I've gone and not once have I been disappointed!"}
{"text":"Went here because I was in the plaza. Worst omelette ive ever had. I ate 2 bites and some of the pancakes (gave the rest to my son) I can't even express how gross this omelette was. The bacon was burnt and the avocados tasted so old and like nasty fridge. But the smell was so rotten. Worst place and maybe I just ordered the wrong thing. But I won't be back to find out."}
{"text":"I think it's obvious by other reviews that you'll either love this place or you'll hate it. And by the sounds of it, their service and food are inconsistent. So, if you're looking for a guaranteed \"good eat\" this IS NOT the place. We are a family of four and were looking for a good place to eat brunch one Saturday morning before taking our kids around town. My sister-in-law said she enjoyed JP Pancake, so we thought we would  give it a try. My son (4) and my daughter (1) were very hungry, and thinking this was a breakfast/lunch joint, the service would be quick. At 10:30am they seated us and our order was promptly taken. The waitress was very friendly and brought us our drinks right away. Time passed and my children grew even hungrier, but my husband and I did our best to pacify and entertain them.  I came to the realization that my daughter was not going to make it until the food came out, so I began to prepare a bottle for her. Not only did they NOT have filtered water but I had to walk out of the restaurant, across the parking lot, to another \"fast food joint\" to buy a $2.00 bottle of water to prepare her bottle. By the time I got back to the restaurant our food STILL was not out. At 11:30am our food finally makes an appearance. Everything was thoroughly cooked (thank goodness!), however, the quality wasn't any better than IHOP, Village Inn, or Denny's. If I'm going to wait that long for my meal it better be \"Farmhouse\" quality. The biscuits and gravy were tasteless, the bacon and eggs were saturated in oil and grease.... Pretty much the only thing worth eating was the pancakes/French toast.  To their credit they did offer us a 20% discount for the long wait, which took a whole $5.00 off our bill. When we finally left at 12:00pm, an hour and a half later, I was exhausted! Needless to say we just went home after that ordeal. Thank you JP Pancake for ruining what we hoped to be a fun day out with our kids."}
{"text":"I must say that this place has some fine pancakes and waffles.  I first came here one Mother's Day when the place was packed and the service was awful.  I tried it again and was extremely satisfied.  The chocolate pancakes were simply outstanding.  The French toast as well.  The place normally has a wait, but is worth the patience.  The seating is substandard at best.  Not enough tables during the peak weekend hours, but the staff seems to function, nonetheless.

I am not sure why so many people give subpar reviews to this place.

The breakfast food is amongst the finest in the Valley."}
{"text":"The food is good! Service and atmosphere is not great. No music or anything, kind of an awkward quiet restaurant. The server was off, made a few sharp comments that we didn't understand if he was being rude or sarcastic. If you want a quick breakfast stop in, if you want an experience try another place."}
{"text":"Great little no-frills breakfast spot with reliably good food and decent service. Try the pigs in a blanket for sure!"}
{"text":"Love that they have gluten free options, and their sausage is the best anywhere! Service can be hit or miss, depending on who you get..."}
{"text":"OK I almost didn't go because of the mixed reviews. But I am Really glad I did. We were seated right away and within a few minutes had our drinks (nice strong coffee) and then our order taken. The food was hot, fresh and Delicious! I will say it is alittle more than I usually pay but I will be bring my parents here when they come for the winter. Try it for yourself. I thought it was great!"}
{"text":"Saw this place while I was on my way out of the Frys. Thought I might as well roll the dice and it came out wonderfully. The staff was very helpful and courteous. They always made sure that my coffee cup was always full, never can have too much coffee. (BTW the coffee was real good). The food was also great, I had the regular pancakes and split an oven baked pancake and they were both fantastic, not too sweet, a little crispy, honestly get both of them you can't go wrong. I definitely plan on going back again."}
{"text":"Gluten free pancakes! Can't wait!

I was waiting to write this review because i was really hoping to get in here a second time before leaving Arizona. Unfortunately this didn't happen so I'll go based on my only visit. 

The atmosphere is a bit off, no one greeted us at the front and the entry looked as if it was maybe being remodeled, it was difficult to tell for sure. We kind of wandered in and sat down and someone came over to serve us. 

I had gluten free chocolate chip and banana pancakes with bacon and orange juice and I remember it being most excellent. The person I was with had some type of omelet and bacon I think and he thought it was good, but not amazing. I think for gluten free, the breakfast options are unbeatable, especially in the Mesa area. 

Price was really affordable and service was pretty average. As I mentioned, if I still lived in the area I would definitely consider visiting here again!"}
{"text":"Nice casual place. The owner is an artist so some of his pictures are up on the walls. Everything is very healthy. definitely good for a person who likes clean eating. Nothing is fried the omelette is even baked. They're toast is also homemade and very good. Definitely perfect for healthy people like myself."}
{"text":"Wow. What a disappointment !!  I try to support local small businesses, but this one needs to be shut down!  Server dropped off waters and coffee by holding then suspended from the rim. The most disgusting amateur move ever for a restaurant!  The french toast looked good from the outside until you take a bite of dry bread. Instead of soaking the bread in egg they flash coat it, leaving you eating a dry piece of bread!! My over medium eggs looked liked they were cooked in a fryer!  And my wife's scrambled eggs were not even cooked.  Will never be back!!  What a shame! Pic is example of how they drop off drinks!"}
{"text":"I heard people rave about JP Pancake for a while now so one morning we decided to check it out. The place is cute and homey feeling. Our server was nice but the poor thing was spread very thin and had a hard time keeping up with her tables. We all ordered different things from the menu and we all agreed that the food was average.  Although, it was not the best experience, it was also not the worse. I have them on my list to try again.... Maybe next time I will try one of their famous baked pancakes!"}
{"text":"Fantastic gluten free options! Fresh made breads, waffles, pancakes. The baked stuffed pancakes are amazing even though they aren't GF."}
{"text":"First timers at this restaurant. My first impression  was service was really good, food fairly priced, and oven baked pancakes are huge. I give this place 4 put of 5 because facility needs a lil updating and what we ordered was super greasy (loaded potato breakfast) other then that we will be back soon."}
{"text":"Look- This is the best pancake place in the Phoenix area, without question, no room for debate. Actually, it's possible that JP has one of the best short stacks in the US.

I don't know what it is about Yelp ratings in Phoenix, but the majority of them are:
 * poorly formed: as in, \"...got coffee at Ted's Hotdogs, it was bad, 1 star.\" 
 * inapplicable: \"they were closed at Midnight, 1 star.\"
 * or just insane: \"Great FOOD! But they didn't take my expired 25 cent coupon, 1 star.\"

Because of this, I've noticed a trend in Phoenix restaurants that are rated as an average 3 stars, that are actually phenomenal. JP Pancake, is without question, a phenomenal place to get pancakes, and their current averaged rating of 3.5 on Yelp is baffling and frankly unjust. 

I mean, I've been all over the US getting breakfast. It's a serious subject to me, and to put it frankly, it's my favorite M*****F***ing meal. I've been lucky enough to sample the majority of the west and east coast's famed pancake houses including: The Original Pancake House in Portland, OR, Ina's in Chicago, IL, Richard Walker's Pancake House in San Diego, CA, Pamela's in Pittsburgh, PA, and even good ol' (kinda overrated) Matt's Big Breakfast in Phoenix. 

Out of all of these places, you want to know where my favorite short stack is from? It's from JP Pancake in Gilbert. When it comes to pancakes, there's such a variety out there that it always comes down to preference. For me, my favorite is just a butter and syrup short stack that's slightly just ever-so crisp on the outside, but fluffy, buttery, and melt-in-your-mouth in the middle. None of the places I've been to in the USA does this as well as JP does. 

I've been here several times already and have been lucky to sample most of their menu, and I wouldn't be writing this review if I didn't think it held up to the competition. In addition to their standard pancake, they have a wonderful selection of baked pancakes as well. While their baked pancakes might not be as thick as the ones from Ina's or OPH's, they are just as flavor-gasmic. And you know what? I even prefer their thinner texture over Ina's! I think the thinner but still absolutely delicious texture allows you to appreciate the toppings more than when you otherwise just get a mouthful of fat pancake. Honestly, JP is the only place in Phoenix I found that has a baked pancake, and while it's German styled thin texture is different than the east coast variety, I think it is a needed improvement of pancake to topping ratio which makes each bite more enjoyable, and appropriately portioned. If you're looking for a Chicago style pancake the size of a pie, then this isn't it, but who gives a flying Foucault over size when the difference in texture actually IMPROVES the flavor! (At least in my opinion!)

Like I said, I'm serious about breakfast.

In short, their baked pancakes are superb, their plain pancakes are the best I've had in the US, and they refill your coffee as if it was necessary to sustain your life, which arguably, it is. In addition, their toppings are fresh, flavorful, and diverse, so if you like your perfect short stack with blueberries in it, you're set. There's simply nothing better than this place for pancakes in AZ, and if you think differently, you possibly just have bad taste.

P.S. They also bake their bacon and it 's just f***ing wonderful."}
{"text":"What happened to this great place? New owners? Was our favorite place to go - now is just plain BAD!!! \"home made bread\" for toast was thin, cheap store-bought, \"thick cut challa\" french toast was made out of the same crappy store-bought bread. Never got refills on my coffee, creamer curdled when put in my cup, Over easy eggs were over cooked, and to boot, the waiter looked like he just rolled out of bed and put on week-old dirty crumpled clothes. Gross! What a waste of a beautiful morning and $40."}
{"text":"My family just had breakfast here the other day and it was scrumptious! They have a few kid toys (always a plus), friendly employees and the French toast was beyond amazing"}
{"text":"Just ate breakfast at JP Pancake for the first time. I went with my 5 year old son an he had a great time with the little games on the tables and ate everything in his plate! He had the scrambled eggs, sourdough toast, and home fries with a size of bacon. I had the house buttermilk pancakes and they were FANTASTIC! The owners were very nice as well. I will be returning with my husband and other children... Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"Food: 4.5 stars. Good solid breakfast food with a real home cooked vibe. 
Service:  well. Yeah.  That's a thing.  I've been here 5-6 times and service has fluctuated between 1-3 stars at best.  I've recently had probably the worst experience with service today.  I don't know if there was anxiety with the one server or what but there was no conversation, no eye contact, no follow through.  Most tables were dirty and folks waited a LONG time for service.  (I heard a mumble regarding them just getting over the rush, but TBH we were there for about an hour and we were one of four table total most of the time). 

Would I come back?  Probably.  Its good hearty breakfast food.  But I'll come in with absolutely zero expectations of good service."}
{"text":"First off, if you don't have 2 hrs to kill then don't bother. We went on a Sun morning and waited FOREVER to get seated. Then waited FOREVER for our food.

I am a huge Cracker Barrel pancake fan. I think they have the ultimate butter milk stack you could ever feast upon. 

SO with that being said, I had very high expectations for this place. After all they do claim to have the \"Best\" pancakes. 

Mine were flat with no fluff and not much flavor. Thank god for the whipped butter (which deserves at least 1 more star).

My boyfriend ordered the blueberry baked pancake, eh, its was so so as well. 

The pancake batter is just not up to par. I expect much more from the \"best\".  I bet they don't even use buttermilk."}
{"text":"I love the redecorating that happened since my last visit. Makes it feel more organized. The previous decor was kinda roadside diner ish. 
The last time I was there was during the week, when I guess they didn't offer the baked pancake. I have heard so many people who sing praises about the dish. Finally made it in on the weekend to see what the big deal was about. I ordered the caramel apple variety. It does take a bit for it to cook so don't expect speedy delivery. It shows up and looked amazing! The apples are freshly sliced, so you still get that good cooked apple feeling. On delivery, you could tell that the inside was boiling lava....lol. I cut it up to help it cool down and proceeded to eat my bacon. The flavor was awesome. What I wasn't impressed with was the texture. The batter must have a high egg count because as it was cooled enough to be palatable, the pancake itself became kinda rubbery. I was able to eat about half before being full and deciding that I couldn't chew it anymore.
Please, don't mistake my review as being a bad one. The wait staff were great, and there were so many other dishes that I would love to try. I just wasn't impressed by my order."}
{"text":"Food was really good.  Oven baked pancake was crazy good. Atmosphere was a little odd as it was uncomfortably quiet ....no music made it very easy to hear everyone's conversation as tables are so close together"}
{"text":"I wouldn't want to fully draft my true thoughts here, however, \"very bad\" may suffice.  Here's the run down: coffee flavor was marginal, the 3 egg omelette was very small for that quantity & lacked most of 4 requested ingredients, their signature baked pancake is over priced-wafer thin with more sugar than flavor, but the home fries were excellent.  Overall, no need to return.  Thank God I went with a Groupon."}
{"text":"This used to be one of my favorite breakfast joints but over the past 6 months they have gone downhill, FAST! I go in regularly, and take to go regularly, when they DO answer the phone I am consistently met with their \"open\" times being different from before and from what is on the website, which has been confusing to say the least, but not a huge deal. When I go in, especially lately, I have noticed an abundance of incorrect orders. The past THREE times someone in our parties order has come out wrong, and surrounding tables too, it is a roulette with plates of food and tables being confused in there anymore. A little strange but they're usually busy so that may be the culprit. Last time I ordered the home fries, I found bacon in them, being I am a vegetarian I called the waitress over and she explained they recently made a change to the recipe adding bacon fat to the home fries, this was astounding being it was NOT listed that way on the menu and that is a huge concern being eating bacon is against many religions and dietary restrictions... I was very disappointed in this huge omission. Lastly, the last time I was in there our waitress had a ring of white powder around her nose and kept inhaling in a ridiculous and exaggerated way. It reminded me of something you would see on a Tv show when someone is overacting when filming a drug scene, GET IT TOGETHER JP! What used to be my favorite breakfast joint is now an inconsistent mess of a restaurant."}
{"text":"Ok, so I tried the one in Gilbert and gave it a terrible review because of the waitress and price of food. So a friend said to try the one in Scottsdale because the food is really good and there is a younger waitress that is spot on with the service.
This place is down right scummy! Don't eat here is you value your life. The wiatress no longer works there and good for her. She was smart enough to get out of this dump. This owner Chad is a jerk. So arrogant and sits around on his stupid phone while others are working. I really don't blame the wait staff. The apple bakes are suppose to be the best around. Sure if you like your food to put you in a diabetic coma. There was so much sugar, I am surprise it didn't give be diabetes right then. I had to ask for an egg over easy just to try to eat something good. After waiting for 30 minutes for one egg, wow. $2.25 for 1 egg. It's an egg with nothing in it or on it. My first review of this place was correct. NOOOOOOO Way, Never again!!!!!"}
{"text":"Disgusting!  For all of you that gave this place rave reviews,  you obviously have no idea this place doesn't clean their cooking area. The waffle maker and pans are not cleaned daily.  This place needs a visit from the health department.  Gross!"}
{"text":"Fresh, baked omelettes are delicious.

And the oven-baked specialty pancakes alone are worth the trip!"}
{"text":"Found this place by accident and holy crap. Delicious. The oven baked pancakes are heaven. My girlfriend has to eat gluten free and she legitimately almost cried when she learned that nearly every menu item can be made gluten free. If you're thinking about giving it a try, do it. Especially for you GF people out there"}
{"text":"I brought a groupon deal for this place a few months back. You know those groupons you buy that end up being totally regrettable- enough so that you take to the internet to type a review on Yelp to help other unsuspecting patrons avoid the mistake you made? Yep, that's what I'm doing right now. 

This place is not near our house at all, so I bought a cup of coffee on the road with my husband. As we walked up to the establishment, the coffee police.....errr.... JP Pancake staff intercepted me outside and demanded I throw my coffee away \"That's not allowed inside here, you must purchase our coffee if you are going to have any with your meal\". Seriously?? I hadn't even stepped off the parking lot asphalt yet. Give me a sec. Her demand was loudly done in front of other patrons sitting on the patio. It was embarrassing and made me feel like I was being scolded like a child. Of course I wouldn't have brought my coffee inside. The trash can was still 15 feet away from me- let me leave the parking lot to get to the trash to throw it out, woman!  It set the tone for the rest of our regrettable breakfast.

The inside of the establishment was small. It appeared clean, but I immediately noticed our table was sticky. We were sat at a table practically on top of  somebody else. Upon opening the menu- everything was obviously overpriced. No special ingredients listed that could contribute to an elevated place. Just the Scottsdale zip code and poor management.

I ordered pancakes. They arrived late and cold. On the positive side, I know they were fresh......... because they were completely raw in the middle. Mine actually ran with pancake batter. I'm not exaggerating. I'm not a fan of raw pancakes. I ate around the sides of the pancake that were better cooked and threw away more than half of my overpriced plate.

They are not accommodating even to cover for their own poor planning problems. I had asked for fruit on the side and they said I would have to pay extra. Normally this would be fine- but if your restaurant is out of the 2 other sides I had requested before settling on the fruit, a respectable place would serve the fruit without the upcharge.

Back to the coffee incident- I did buy coffee after the coffee police demanded I dump out my throw away travel cup. I would have bought their coffee anyway and would never bring my own cup into a restaurant- just didn't need the insult when I hadn't even reached the door to throw it out. Their  coffee was terrible- tasted burned and weak. They also ran out of cream and sugar substitute. It seemed as though they just ran out of food they day we came- and made no attempt to rectify the situation. 

To sum it up- nothing was worth coming back. The coffee police really pushed it over the edge for me. Rude customer service, bad food (that was actually available- b/c a lot was \"out\"), bad seating.

Save yourself the trouble- never come here."}
{"text":"Best breakfast joint in the east valley. Staff is friendly and the biscuits and gravy is amazing.

Get here early or you'll miss out!"}
{"text":"Purchased a Groupon and even waited a month before trying to redeem. It didn't matter the wait was 30-45 minutes so we decided to wait, outside in the cold! While I was waiting I noticed a sign on the front door that said a gratuity of 18% would be added to all Groupon customers. I have been a long time Groupon customer and have never seen that before. Is that even legal? Especially since it isnt stated anywhere on the Groupon. It is called a gratuity people! And who do they think they are telling me how much I have to leave as a tip. In general my husband and I leave 20%+ depending on the service. So I guess they lost out there. Its just the principle! After waiting 35 minutes to get seated and another 10 to order we finally ordered only for me to find out they were out of what I had wanted. The main thing they did that really showed me that customer service was important to them was they actually gave my husband and I our Groupon back after eating so we could come back and try them again. I will let you know how it goes next time...........More to come"}
{"text":"Awesome baked pancakes, we like the Apple and/or banana as well as their home fries! Yummy biscuits and gravy too! Definitely a fave breakfast spot!"}
{"text":"Me and my family came here for the first time today and it was great!!! Everything from the Potatoes  to the pancakes were so good!!! Not a real big place, more like a hole in the wall but you know that sometimes those are the best places. Will be coming back for sure. Thanks!!"}
{"text":"We've been going to JP for a couple of years now. All of their food is fresh. The owner and cook shop locally for all of their fruit and veg and support the local growers as much as they can. Nothing comes from a mix here. 

The biscuits and gravy are awesome. The gravy has a nice sage/pepper flavor to it, slightly different from other gravies, but well worth the change.

The oven baked pancakes are awesome. They often try our new flavors, so be certain to check the menu board.  Because of the typical sweetness of the ovenbake, I would recommend getting a side of ham or bacon for some added protein to balance it out.

The staff is friendly and if you catch them on a slower day, they will happily chat with you about local goings on.

Love them"}
{"text":"We are full and happy! The service was excellent and the food was fabulous! We shared a delicious half order of homemade biscuits and gravy as an appetizer while we waited for our pumpkin nut oven baked pancake, which the two of us also shared. The pancake was amazing and huge! We were only able to finish 2/3 of it. It was almost a dessert after the savory gravy."}
{"text":"Found this place because I bought 3 Groupons.  The first time we came here was the week after the Groupon came out, which is always a mistake because this place was filled to the gills!  We were lucky to snag a table for 4 after only a short 10 minute wait.  However, several people ahead of us left because of the wait.  The other 2 visits here were no problem, but that was because it was 4+ weeks later and the Groupon rush was over.

After 3 visits, here's my breakdown of the joint:

+We enjoy the Mom & Pop feel to the place.  It's cozy and comforting.

+The food is pretty good.  I've had the Pancakes, Breakfast Burrito, and Waffle.  All very very good.

http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/V81Ahkb9QFlbEx4PoeRiyA?select=MV3p0qgtMtc0j2wg-rItQA

+There's Gluten-Free options.  The Better Half enjoys those options even though she's not allergic to Gluten.

-The Coffee is terrible.  Watered down.

-The prices are a bit high, but considering the quality of the food isn't too bad.  Just don't expect to come in and get Denny's or IHOP pricing.  Let's just say I'm glad I had the Groupon.

Overall, we enjoyed our visits here.

Return Factor - 60%"}
{"text":"Do not waste your time or money for  bad food, should have known better when it was basically empty 9AM Saturday  Had one of the worst breakfeast burritos of all times with a side of blah pancakes served with syrup that tasted like Great Value syrup. Server friendly maybe she should cook it?"}
{"text":"After hearing about the wonderful breakfasts at JP Pancake, we decided to give it a whirl.  It was Saturday morning and the restaurant was busy, but we were seated after we caught the attention of one of the servers.  There is no hostess at the door.  A waitress promptly took our drink and food orders.  That is the last time that the word \"prompt\" can be applied to our experience.  We decided to pass on the oven baked pancakes because the menu stated it would take twenty minutes to prepare, opting instead for beligan waffles.  It took well over thirty minutes and three inquiries to receive our food.  The waffles were fine, but not exceptional.  The waitress disappeared after we began questioning the length of time it was taking to get our food.  Not once did we receive an apology for the exceptionally long wait.

As noted by another reviewer, the food was good but not worth the wait.  It was a disappointing experience and we will not be back."}
{"text":"If you are looking for a unique local spot for breakfast with amazing food...this is it! Small dining room, but they were able to accommodate our group of 13 with a call ahead. This place is ideal for a tables of 5 or less. 

I tried the traditional German baked pancake that they are famous for with apples and cinnamon. Wow! It was airy, light, delicate and delicious! Even my husband who doesn't order pancakes thought it was fantastic. 

A few people in our group went for their famous biscuits and gravy and they were NOT disappointed! Made from scratch and gravy chocked full of sausage, it was loved all around.

The chef came out to say hi and the servers were very casual and friendly.

We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Service was excellent. We loved our food. Probably the best pancake I ever had. Eggs and potatos perfect. Coffee good diner style. Love this place and the people."}
{"text":"This restaurant sucks!!!!! The service is the worst I have ever seen. The food is nothing to talk about. The dining room is filthy, I actually went back out to my car to get a placemat for my daughter, since the table was so sticky. My daughter's milk didn't come out till after the food was there. Don't even bother with this place, not worth the wait or the calories. Ihop is wayyyyyyyy better!"}
{"text":"Finally got to try this place and the food and service was very good, we will be back!  Had the cranberry/orange baked pancake it was worth the wait, it was VERY good!  The food tastes like good ole home cooking and their homemade wheat bread was so good!"}
{"text":"You cannot come here and order anything beside the oven baked pancake. They are heavenly. We call it our hungover food. It's delicious and they take pride in them! They usually take a little bit longer to bake but once you have the first bite, you will not be disappointed. YUM!"}
{"text":"Baked pancake was deflated and completely flat.  my wife did not like the apple pancake.  my raspberry pancake was ok.  Kind of small portion for $9.00. Coffee was good Servers were Ok, but the busser was more attentive. I would not return here for breakfast."}
{"text":"This place is great! Went w my friends on a Sunday morning, so there was a little bit of a wait as it is a small restaurant. My friend got the bacon pancakes (they taste pretty much how you'd imagine) and I got the blueberry pancakes. They are oven-baked, so they say it takes around 20 minutes to cook. Although the restaurant was busy, we got our food in under 15 minutes. It was great! The pancakes are average size, so I'd say the average person can eat 2. Great prices too!!!!"}
{"text":"Cute place, reminded me if the cafeteria style restaurants in the Ukraine. I had a cheese mushroom avocado omelette and pancakes, it was pretty tasty and reasonably priced. They have \"Baked Pancakes\" here that take 20 minutes to prepare and look like Bundt cakes!"}
{"text":"I went here with my husband on a friday. Less than half capacity and seated ourselves. After seating we waited about 10 minutes to place our order. Our drinks were served after another 5 minutes and we waited and waited for our pancakes... more than 25 minutes. Once the food arrived we were so excited to dig into our meals. I noticed the nice scoop of softly melting butter onto of my  banana waffle and it actually looked so fluffy and light I tasted a small bit to be sure it wasn't whip cream. My mouth was greeted by a small, but overwhelmingly crucial detail....they used salted butter. Not just lightly salted butter....this was REALLY salty butter. I quickly try to scrape as much butter off the pancake, but alas, it had mostly already soaked into the waffle. Even after pouring more than a comfortable amount of maple syrup onto the waffle it was so salty. I tried to move on to the bacon instead and then I really got upset. THEY SALTED THE BACON TOO!!!!  Who does that?!?! It was inedible, but even a little bit made my mouth dry. I asked my husband about his meal and he had the same problem. Salty pancakes.  So, terrible food and lackluster service make this a no-go in my book. Sorry, wanted to like it. Just didn't happen."}
{"text":"You would think a place called \"JP (just perfect) Pancake\" would have exceptional pancakes. Youd be wrong. Average. Like Denny's average. 

Seat yourself. Ok. We do. It took forever for the waiter to see us and forever again to get his attention when we were ready to order. I ordered The \"pigs in a blanket\" w/ a side of homefries. Again, average pancakes wrapped around alright sausage. And they forgot my potatoes. We finally asked for them and the waitress/owner looked at us sideways and then said \"Oh yeah! Sorry.\" I wish I hadnt asked for them. They put some kind of grainy seasoning on them...after theyre cooked. So all I tasted was dry salt/seasoning on burnt potatoes.

Couldnt get our check fast enough."}
{"text":"Two words - Apple Pancake. The boyfriend and I visited JP Pancake a few weeks ago on the recommendation from a friend. We liked it so much we went back the next morning. On Saturday I got the regular pancakes and he got blueberry. Both were excellent but when we saw the apple pancake at the table next to us, jealousy set in. And the guy at the next table said it was really good.
We decided to see if that guy was right and went back on Sunday. He was right. The apple pancake is awesome. It's an oven baked pancake, often called a dutch baby or as I like to say a pannekoeken. So it comes out of the oven all puffed up and then falls as it cools. It's kinda like eating an apple pie for breakfast. Delish. One of my new all-time breakfast favorites. I almost hate to tell people how good it is because the wait wasn't bad and if word gets out that means I have to wait longer. But I also want this best kept secret to stick around so here I am.

As for the woman who said the staff was rude, we found them to be snarky, fun and like an old friend. I guess we have sarcastic friends."}
{"text":"Great Food better service. My coffee is never empty and the biscuits and gravy and oven baked pancakes make it our choice for breakfast."}
{"text":"We've been to JP a couple of times before, but this time we had the worst service I've ever had - ever. We were seated right away, had to wait 10 minutes for menus, then another 15 minutes before the waitress took our beverage and food order. We had to ask for silver ware 3 times and my husband never got his coffee cup refilled. It took about 20 minutes for the food to arrive, not bad, but mine was burnt. Another 10 minutes waiting for the check, and after waiting 15 minutes for the credit card to  be picked up, we paid cash instead and left. We won't be back."}
{"text":"I REALLY wanted to love this place as the owners are friends of my parents and It's locally owned. I heard some good things.

I was disappointed with my omelet. It was cooked to a dark brown & pretty well done. HOWEVER, once I dove in I was pleasantly surprised with the freshness of the food inside. I really appreciate scratch & real ingredients. My friend's omelet looked the same but he ate his up!

The potatoes though...WOW! Deelish and I'd go back just for them. 
The other side of the restaurant, the waiting area & counter, was a mess. The bathroom needs some updating & cleaning as well."}
{"text":"The French toast was out of this world! The bread was moist and had swirls of cinnamon. Honestly, syrup was optional. The service was very quick and our waitress was very friendly. I only had the French toast, but the pancakes and gluten free French toast looked just as heavenly."}
{"text":"Like many others, I bought the Groupon. Won't ever pass up a breakfast Groupon! Plus it's very close to my house. I had seen this place before in passing, so I was pretty excited to try it.

It is a VERY tiny place. Tables are very close together, so if you don't like people, you probably shouldn't go here! I wish I could give it 3.5 stars. My meal was good, but it's hard to mess up simple things like bacon, eggs and waffles. My eggs were kinda brown though.  I also cannot stand places that don't have fountain soda machines. My \"coke\" was a can of coca-cola poured into a glass with ice, which is a big no no  for me. The other half of my complaint is that my boyfriend's blueberry oven baked pancake looked NOTHING like they are supposed to. They are supposed to look raised and fluffy, but this was completely flat and looked bad. He SAYS it was good, though. but still, if everyone else's looks awesome, how come ours looked like a regular pancake? Chef Ramsay would of been sad at the presentation.

I think I would come back, but not without a coupon."}
{"text":"Small restaurant in a fairly empty looking strip mall.  Depending on time of day, day of week or how busy they are you may be instructed to sign in or simply seat yourself.  The decor is simple, volume is low enough that you can actually hear the music (Wonderful Tonight by Eric Clapton is playing ).  
Not sure if there are multiple waitresses and one young lady covering bussing and seating/greeting, but they get it all done in a reasonable manner.  
This IS a relaxed business.  We and the others that are dining here are not in a hurry to get our food, gobble it down and leave.   Don't misunderstand, service isn't slow, it's just a bit more laid back and relaxed atmosphere.  
The qi is good here.
The breakfast options for food loving, gluten free limited consumers is also good here.  
So frustrated when I read reviews saying some place has GF and they don't have sh!t, or they're limited to a loaf of GF bread and they are so creative that they have many options.  Bread, toast, French toast.
Here, the bread is made from scratch.  The pancake and waffle batter is made from scratch, and they're different recipes.    
Let me tell you, the menu is set up so many items seem a la carte.  I didn't think it made much sense initially but I've quickly realized that it's so much better like this.  I can't eat three pieces of French toast, 2 pieces of bacon isn't enough, sometime I want an egg.  So ya don't have to look for a section of the menu that lists items a la carte, you basically order what you want.  You know, just like you would do it at home if you had all of the ingredients- and could/wanted to cook.  
Another crazy thing I love here.  
They have a corking fee.  If you don't know what that is, scroll along.
For my CA guests, this is a must when dining out.  
Most servers in AZ are clueless about this option and sadly too many establishments don't want to offer this service.  
We ate a lot cuz it's just SO GOOD.  Surprisingly we had leftovers so we asked for a small to go container.  
She brings out 2 and I told her we only need one.  She points out I don't want to contaminate the GF with the non-GF.  Very thoughtful.  We stuck with just one container to reduce waste and cuz i suspected my son would eat the leftovers without issue.  Hehehe!
Such a simple place but with many perks.  
Nicely done JB's."}
{"text":"I have been coming to JP for all my breakfast needs for almost two years now since I stumbled upon the place. Service is amazing and very family owned feeling. Super laid back but still quick service. The oven baked omelets are to die for. I always get a ham and cheese omelet an am not a big ham eater but this ham rocks. Also comes with two pancakes that are so good, all you need is butter to devour them. Love love love this place. Any of the people that gave bad reviews to his place obviously came on a weekend morning when they are packed to the max with loyal regulars waiting in line. Best breakfast place in AZ"}
{"text":"Food is really good (when they get your take out order right), service is subpar, always looks like they're understaffed, no hostess, have to track someone down to let them know you're picking up a to go order most of the time. But the food keeps me coming back, so.."}
{"text":"What a great place for those of us who have to eat gluten-free.  However; I have a test and it has yet to fail me.  When I place my water order, usually with lime & light on the ice, I experience that when my water order is brought to me incorrect then our food order comes out incorrect.  And again my water test has yet to fail me.  I ordered strawberry waffles with whipped cream and a side of bacon BURNT.  I even expressed to our waitress that I do not like any life in my bacon.  Well...my order was received without strawberries & whipped cream AND my bacon was still moo-ing.  Needless to say, I had to send it back.  Bacon was okay but not nearly how I like it.  I guess they do not know the consistency of  \"burnt\".  I liked my food ... I just wish I did not have to send my food back.  Waitstaff needs to listen to their customers and inspect orders prior to placing it in front of the customer.  I am in the customer service industry and I do as I ask of others."}
{"text":"I am amazed that this place got such bad reviews. This was the best pancakes I have ever had! The service was great as well. The owner came out and chatted with us as well. Gina is so sweet and nice. I'm telling everyone that lives in the East Valley to go there. There are not many places that you can get fast & good service with phenomenal food! 
I had the oven-baked banana nut pancakes. They were fantastic. The other person I was with got pancakes, eggs, and bacon. I stole a piece of bacon from his plate and it was delicious. Its difficult to find a place that cooked bacon just right. Not too crispy but not flimsy. 
I'm not an owner nor related to the owner. I am just an East Valley resident who was pleasantly surprised that this restaurant is in my neighborhood. 
The restaurant is not much to look at from the outside or the street but the food is what makes this restaurant worth while."}
{"text":"Why are there so many cry babies complaining about the wait??!! This food is so great and made so well and the people are so nice. I don't get it. Good food takes time and isn't made in advance. Get over it already! Yeesh!"}
{"text":"Some of the best pancakes I have ever had. Light, fluffy and moist. Hooked the first time i tried them a year ago. Also, recently been hooked on the burrito they make..a bit pricey but very good. Not many place have good chorizo but JPs surprisingly does. Potatoe, egg, chorizo, avocado and cheese ...awesome...enjoy the art and small mom pop feel..."}
{"text":"12/03/12

Hmm... I could've sworn I had written a review of this place before.  At the very least, I uploaded a few pics of our breakfast here many months ago.  Took my Mom to try the oven-baked pancakes once.  Do yourself a favor and pass on these!  Guess the review AND photos were taken down.  (Let's see how long this NEW review sticks before it's taken down, too.)

Cousin texted me yesterday and asked if I'd join her for breakfast at JP Pancake today, and I texted her back guessing that it was too late to warn her not to buy the Groupon... Yes, it was.  I thought it would be a good opportunity to see if JP had improved on its service and food prep.  As you can see, it hasn't...

We arrived around 7:35 am to see a deserted parking lot with the exception of one car parked in front of JPP.  It looked like we were the only souls there, besides our server and the cook in the kitchen.  I thought perhaps we'll get better service this time, since we were the only customers.  The young man asked us to sit wherever we wanted, handed us the menus and asked if we'd like some coffee or juice to start with.  I asked for coffee, while my two cousins settled on hot cocoa.  He said he'd see if they had any in the back first.  He came back a few minutes later with their mugs of cocoa (Swiss Miss and canned whip cream) and said he'd be back with my coffee.  Upon his return, we placed orders of a \"Golden brown\" waffle ($6.25), two full orders of French toast (one with strawberries, one with bananas, $7.95 per), and two sides of bacon (3 pieces each, $3.25 per).  I later asked if the side of ham is off-the-bone, and after consulting with the cook, he came back with a \"yes.\"  I placed a late order of that, as well.  

While the service was good (food arrived fast, server checked back to see how we were doing), the breakfast we had wasn't as good.  Our French toast slices http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/jp-pancake-scottsdale?select=Q5s2HavHzD9RrGJOUbx0NA#Q5s2HavHzD9RrGJOUbx0NA were very dry-- the menu stated challah bread, but I think it was more like cake, and the slices could've used a longer soak in the egg batter.  Out of the six halves on my cousin's plate, she only had one (and all but one of her berry slices!), while I had one slice and a quarter of another of my platter.  I would've suggested we share a plate, but she didn't want to get bananas, and I didn't want any berries...  As I've said, the only winner this morning was the waffle, and I think the dollops of butter had a lot to do with its success.  (Also, I brought my own bottle of organic pure maple syrup, since most restos offer up a non-organic cane and corn syrup blend.  My cousin tried mine first before trying the restaurant's own syrup, ditched that, and then used mine until she was finished eating.)  Their sides of bacon http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/jp-pancake-scottsdale?select=OP_6MgCnCpDWtxi8JJAijg#OP_6MgCnCpDWtxi8JJAijg were very costly, considering that these were very thin slices and VERY greasy (even for bacon!).  I wouldn't hesitate paying $3.50 for a very nice plate of THICK-SLICED bacon, all-natural even, but these were pathetic-looking.  As unfortunate-looking as they were, however, they did save breakfast for my cousins.  As for the miniature slice of ham http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/jp-pancake-scottsdale?select=cHiSI19XYV1wUDemaXumCA#cHiSI19XYV1wUDemaXumCA I was presented with, I sent that back.  I may have been a fool to agree to waste my calories on a horrible breakfast this morning (thinking it was time to give JPP another chance for improvement), but I'm not that big a fool to allow my cousin to be charged another $3.25 for a paltry serving!

Also, zero props to our server who freaked my cousin out by hugging the wall by the kitchen with what I thought was the hope of keeping out of our vision while being able to hear our conversation without success!  Her sister confirmed seeing this behavior and thought it was very creepy, too.  I wished they'd alerted me sooner (by asking me to switch seats) so that I could see what they were talking about.  Overall, what a lousy way to spend $35* and a breakfast meal out!  :(

*Original ticket was just under $45, which showed the order charges totaling under $38 before tax.  If you account for Scottsdale's food tax of 8.95%, what was the extra $3, or so, for?  A hidden tip?  Finding this hidden charge was surprising, because our server did not know we were using a Groupon.  There was a sign on the door that stipulated that all Groupon customers will be charged an 18% tip at checkout, and my cousin did not mention her Groupon until we were given the check.  Perhaps, just perhaps, JPP assumes that all of their customers are Groupon-users?  Not far-fetched, since the Yelp reviews can't be helping JPP these days..."}
{"text":"I have been to JP 3 times now.  Sadly I have learned to never go on a Saturday AM or you have to wait forever to be seated and to be served.  Go during the week and you will be fine.  I always go with a coupon or buy one get one free deal as they are a bit pricey.  The food is delicious!!!  The place is not very fance, very simple but the people always seem nice."}
{"text":"Maybe 2.5
I ordered the French toast with 2 eggs and bacon. My wife ordered the buttermilk pancakes with home fries and bacon. 
The server said the chef gave me an extra slice because the two I ordered looked small. Ok, that's cool, leftovers for later. My eggs were good, but they and they bacon were excessively greasy. The bacon was... meh. Overcooked and has this \"in the fridge too long\" aftertaste. My French toast had the same aftertaste, and wasn't anything special. My whole meal was around maybe Dennys quality. 

My wife's buttermilk pancake was super thin, not fluffy at all. Her bacon was overdone. Her home fries were full of onions and green peppers, which were on top of her pancake, so guess what her pancake tasted like? Ew. We asked for an order without the onions and peppers, but were told they don't have that. They offered us an pancake in their place because she was still hungry, which we took. They didn't charge us extra for the pancake, but they didn't take the cost of the home fries off either. 

The service was nice, but nothing special, and not much of a sense of humor.

Definitely disappointed, there are so many excellent breakfast places in the area, I don't even know how this place stays open."}
{"text":"Omg! The oven baked pancakes are heavenly and worth the 20 wait. They could use another waitress, but the food is worth it."}
{"text":"We waited 30 minutes from seating to eating and we did not order the baked pancakes that take 20 minutes to cook.  The eggs were a grey/green color inside and overcooked.  The pancakes were good, but not enough to make up for the rest of the experience.  We won't be back."}
{"text":"Fantastic pancakes and huge serving sizes. Proceed with caution, you may end up in a syrup induced coma! So good!"}
{"text":"A friend suggested we have breakfast here today! It was the best decision we made all week!!! Seriously the food is amazing. And the cutest little restaurant I never even knew existed. Upon seeing the amazing & giant German pancakes (oven bakes) coming out, she insisted I order one. I got the apple cranberry and it was amazing-- more like dessert!!!! Two of my friends ordered the omelettes it looked so delicious and there was so much food, enough to feed two people! I saw breakfast Brito come out as well and it was almost the size of my forearm. I cannot wait to go back and take my family with me."}
{"text":"Like many of the other Yelpers here, I came to JP Pancake because I bought a Groupon, twice.
Each time, the service has been sub-par to the point of frustrating.  From my perspective it's a management problem - they don't have and/or schedule enough staff.  
On the most recent visit, we were seated by a server and never given menus or silverware.  A busser ended up taking our drink order about 5 minutes after sitting down.  The coffee was not good.  After about 10 minutes from getting our drinks the waitress came over and asked if we were ready to order - we didn't have any menus...or silverware.
We finally ordered an omelette and french toast.   The food was good once we got our silverware.
Basically, this place gets overwhelmed easily.  You're best bet would be to go on a Tuesday morning or something - or just don't go at all.
 
There are 100 better places to get breakfast around here - put this place on the back burner."}
{"text":"We had Belgium waffle and German pancakes with one side order of bacon and our bill was over$30. Too expensive for breakfast. They charge $1.50 for strawberries and another $1.50 for cream on top of my Belgium waffle."}
{"text":"I got the baked omelette, which was very good and a large portion.  It came with home fries and toast.  I shared with my wife, who ordered the German baked pancake, which was pretty much amazing.   Service was good, food came out quickly, and it was really a pretty good experience.  I think it's a mom and pop operation, but I'm not sure about that.  Definitely would rather come here than one of the chain places."}
{"text":"Bad bad service.   Great food.  Too bad.  We waited for a table and were not acknowledged.  10 minutes for a waitress, another 10 for drinks.  Good food but terrible service although I had bacon that dripped with grease.  Customer service is so rare anymore but I'm going where it's a good dining experience.  While there 3 different parties got up and left because there was only one waitress for all the tables."}
{"text":"My fianc√© and I love coming here, we've been coming for over 2 years together and he has been coming much longer than that. When we walk in they always greet us and then they already know what we want to drink the staff is friendly and welcoming and the pancakes are the best in town!"}
{"text":"I was underwhelmed with our experience. I ordered the Orange Cranberry pancakes, and my husband got the Nutty French Toast. My pancakes had the perfect amount of orange zest, but not enough cranberries. My husband's French Toast was nothing special, and tasted like something we could make at home. 

Our waiter was a little strange. His personality reminded me of Dwight Schrute from The Office. I asked for a pancake recommendation and he said, \"Any of them. Our pancakes are the best you will have in your life.\" He delivered this line in a stoic voice, that reminded me of the aforementioned character talking about his beet farm. 

(Check out this video if you've never seen The Office, and you'll see what I mean: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jxMGklGssS4)

Unfortunately, the pancakes were not the best I've ever had in my life. I can't wait for Snooze to open in Gilbert, so I can eat their heavenly pancakes every weekend."}
{"text":"The food was okay but the service was lacking. I took my friend here for her birthday breakfast because she is gluten free and I heard this place had great gluten free options. We came with my 2 year old and the waitress forgot to put in my daughters order. She apologized and said she would put in her order right away. After several minutes she came back and said sorry but there is a party of seven ahead of the order so it's just going to take a little while. Excuse me but if you put the order in when you should have it should have been done already. Besides its a kids meal, scrambled eggs and a pancake.... You telling me you can't make that quickly? So my daughter was starving and irritable at this point so I slowly started giving me some of my food. When she finally brought over her food it was a half hour later and everyone at the table was done eating. So I just asked for it in a box. As someone that put herself through college waitressing I know that a kids food should always take priority, I also wouldn't have charged the table for the meal that came so late that the table had finished eating and was just waiting. Horrible service, I still tipped her nicely since I know how hard it is to be in food service but I will never go back there and I will make sure I let my it her friends with children know as well."}
{"text":"We've tried the blueberry, peach and orange cranberry oven baked pancakes!  The orange cranberry is hands down the best and I don't even like orange!
The biscuits and gravy are wonderfully different than what I was expecting and worth getting again, and again!"}
{"text":"Omg the Baked pancakes are the bomb that's all I have to say..... Will be returning to this place every week"}
{"text":"I finally made it back for visit number two and the food was as great as the first time. I am definitely going to become a regular here. It was a lot more crowded than my first visit but we did manage to get the last available table. The service did seem a little slow and they can definitely use another person waiting on tables when it is full. The waitress is always friendly even though you can tell on a day like this that she is doing a lot of running around. The waiter is a little strange. He is nice but doesn't always seem comfortable for some reason. I don't know what it is but he is always just so \"blah\". It would help if he had a more outgoing personality rather than just a low, monotone voice asking if you are ready to order. He should smile more but at this point the food is too good for me to really care as long as I get what I ordered and they don't mess it up. I guess the first time I visited I was not too observant but when I looked around this time I noticed the wall art. A bit bizarre for a restaurant. It looked like some sort of alien tribute and one painting looked like it might be some sort of alien abduction theme going on. If you have not tried JP Pancake you need to get out there and give it a try."}
{"text":"Avoid - Went on a Sunday morning, had a coupon from the entertainment book.  This place used to be owned by Flapjacks which is now in Fountain Hills.  First thing wrong is they have you seat yourselves which should not be especially when they are busy and they allow 1 person to sit in a booth made for 5.  The food was terrible, just okay about the same as Denny's nothing special.  The wait was longer then needed to be.  My dad's veggie omelet was sent to the wrong table and when they finally made another one, it came out lukewarm.  My mom's two over easy eggs with two gluten free pancakes - the eggs were cold and the pancakes rubbery like they put them in the microwave.  The waitress asked if we wanted to wait for the cook to make them again letting us know it would be a while as all the other customer's orders were first.  We elected not to wait.  My buttermilk pancakes, well let's just say they are much better at Chompie's or Randy's or even Mimi's or Village Inn.   People were walking out, because they did not have enough help.  Tables sat with dirty plates for more than 30 minutes while people came in and left because no one seem to care.  Not a good place, try other area restaurants for better friendlier service and people who care about the food.  We will not be going back ever."}
{"text":"We love oven pancakes and these were good...but we had to ask for silverware 4 different times and another table finally gave us theirs. Then we had to ask for the check 3 times. Then we had to ask for a pen to sign the receipt twice. Then we had to wait got the server to finish a personal conversation in front if the only door our to our car...it was interesting."}
{"text":"I would love to give a review of the food, but sadly we never even got to try anything here. We came mid afternoon on Father's Day expecting it to be busy.  It was packed, and since we expected this we were okay with the wait. What we were not okay with was being left standing by the sign, stating \"Please wait to be seated\" for the next ten minutes, and have not one person greet us.  The guy behind the bar walked to the other side of the restaurant, and passed us three times and never once made eye contact.  Absolutely horrible service is the only thing to be expected from this place. Do not waste your time or money here. Go across the street to IHOP's. At least there you get the common courtesy of being greeted when you walked through their doors."}
{"text":"Great breakfast joint small, great friendly service. Food is high quality and cooked perfectly.  From scratch as they say. Short hours ,  you will not be disappointed coming for breakfast."}
{"text":"I don't know how JP makes their pancakes - I think there must be space aliens in the kitchen or something like that. They are slightly crispy on the outside and warm and delicious on the inside. The service is really good as is the coffee."}
{"text":"Sad that under new ownership the wait time is excessive.  My lover and I used to be regulars here.  Miss the old waitstaff. Specifically Lee Berger, who created all the artwork prior to their redecoration and new management. We left after a 25 minute wait time without taking our meal order.  This is a travesty!"}
{"text":"Really super scrumptious!!! Delicious house baked oven pancake. Totally worth the wait. Came in at 9 on a Saturday, seated immediately and waitress very attentive and nice. Will be back."}
{"text":"Very bright and open feel in the dining room.

Nicole was my server.

Chorizo breakfast burrito; good size, plenty of meat and potatoes

I asked for only bananas and strawberries, rather than the normal fruit cup, however, the fruit should be mixed a bit before serving.

Prices are kinda steep ($9.25 for the burrito) so I won't likely go back soon, or often.

Good experience."}
{"text":"Growing up in Chicago, I learned that the best places are those hidden treasures. This is one such place. People can complain about things like price and quality. However, this place tops those parameters for me. The staff is very friendly and always eager to hear your feedback. We even got visited by one of the owners (Vera) when we told the chef that the food was superb.

Speaking of the food, I was beyond impressed with the quality of the pancakes.  My wife says I have a tendency to taste pancakes like a sommelier tastes wine (She is right about that). The quality was equivalent to places like Stax Cafe or the Original Pancake House in Chicago. These were the lightest pancakes I have ever eaten and really did not require any syrup. But they did bring the syrup and it was a nice, warm, maple syrup. Definitely very flavorful combined with the pancakes.  Even without syrup, the pancakes had the right amount of moisture and did not feel as heavy as many places typically are. The omelets we had were oven baked and possessed the same light and airy taste of the pancakes.

But the thing that really colors my experience here was the \"regulars\". Seeing the staff interact with them brought back memories of a similar place (A cop hangout) I went to with my father. This restaurant treated us like family and we will look forward to being counted among the \"regulars\"."}
{"text":"Great breakfast place.  Wife is gluten free and they have choices of gluten free waffles,pancakes and French Toast. She had the French toast, had a bite, it was amazing.  Very fresh and had some bounce to the bread unlike other places it's flat.  I had the biscuits and gravy special full order.  Couldn't eat the whole thing.  Very reasonable too.   Definitely swing by here for breakfast if you are gluten free or not.  You won't be disappointed. 
Service was awesome too.  Have the wife a feee gluten free pancake to sample also."}
{"text":"Great neighborhood place.  Try the orange/cranberry oven pancakes & Belgian Waffles- both very good!  Have great coffee & the servers make sure your cup is never empty.  Very friendly staff, the owner even comes out to talk to the diners! Makes you feel at home."}
{"text":"Unbelievably slow service! They either need less tables or more help. French toast was mushy. One star for the pancakes being palatable."}
{"text":"Very casual and family friendly. Little toys on the table for while you wait. The seating area is not the cleanest, but it is a no frills breakfast joint. Our wait staff was friendly.

Came for the baked pancakes. There are other places in valley to get a baked pancake, but we came here because it was closer to us. If you've had a baked pancake before, don't expect the same thing here. On the plus side, they offer many flavors of their baked pancake (their website is not kept up-to-date; some flavors may not be available). However, the pancakes are not as doughy, do not have as much caramelization, not as much apple, and are not as filling as a more traditional baked apple pancake.

I will have to come back to try some different flavors, but in order to compare apples-to-apples (pun somewhat intended), I got the apple baked pancake my first visit. The side of sausage links was nothing spectacular; you are getting some greasy protein at best."}
{"text":"I understand that Sundays at 10am are a busy time for breakfast. This place has some logistical issues that need to be worked out. There is no host stand, and there didn't appear to be an actual host. People just wait around in the \"lobby\" until a server verifies how many people are in the party, and tells them where to sit. 

All the servers seem to wait on every table. This can be confusing. We were seated within about 10-15 minutes of getting there, but the person who sat us didn't give us a menu. We had to flag someone down and ask for a menu. Someone came up after a few minutes to get our drink order. We decided to order our food at that time since we didn't know the next time someone would swing by the table. It took 10 minutes after we ordered to get our coffee and iced tea, and he didn't bring the water we asked for.

When the food came, it was just average. I had a build your own omelette with pancakes. It was not worth the drive or the wait. I won't be back. There are several breakfast options in the area that operate more efficiently and have better food."}
{"text":"The pancakes are fantastic- from the regular old plain pancakes to the deliciously sinful House Special oven baked pancakes.  My husband and I love coming here on the weekends. It's slightly out of street view and doesn't get some of the excessive volume of people that other places have on weekends- places that aren't nearly as good. Unusual paintings on the walls, casual, family atmosphere. We enjoy the male servers sarcastic wit."}
{"text":"This restaurant is terrible.  We went because we got a 2 for 1 coupon. First of all, the place was empty on a Saturday morning. That was the first bad sign. The next bad omen were the prices. They charge $9,25 for an omelet. Then when the food came ingredients were left out of the omelet.  No explanation. When i mentioned it to the waitress, she said they ran out  but she didnt offer to make up for the error. Next my daughter ordered their specialty, the banana strawberry pancakes. Only problem; NO STRAWBERRIES!  Avoid this place. Go to Randys."}
{"text":"Slowwwww service. They weren't very full in there but definitely understaffed (or our waitress was just ignoring us). The menu is wierd with every single item being a la carte. I had the cranberry orange oven baked pancakes...holy sweetness. They had too much orange zest & so much sugar on them they were crunchy. Don't get me wrong, I LOVE sweets but this was way too much sugar even for me. We are breakfast people always looking for a good spot but this was not it. Sadly, we won't be back."}
{"text":"I'm of the opinion that breakfast is pretty hard to fuck up. If you're not ordering something hoity toity, the following formula applies: hot grill+eggs+meat+carb= breakfast. My stomach and I are proud to say inform you that J.P. Pancakes has mastered that formula. They even include some variables in the equation that will knock off your socks and spin them around your head.

It's the small, innocuous looking restaurant in a large strip mall, sandwiched between an Italian restaurant and whatever the hell was on the other side. It's not much to look at, but when the food is this good, it really doesn't matter. Just stick with it until your meal comes. And don't let the constant loop of incredibly shitty KYOT style smooth jazz scare you away. They're willing to turn the volume down, because the waitresses think it's pretty much shite as well.

They're known for their pancakes (duh), but I wasn't really in the mood for a sweet breakfast. I will definitely be coming here the next time that urge strikes though. Their oven baked fluffy cakes looked superb and come in apple, blueberry, strawberry, banana, german and german nutty varieties. Wowzer. There were even more regular pancake and Belgian waffle varieties, as well as traditional breakfast combos and omelets with some pretty cool stuff in them, like avocado or feta cheese. 

I opted for the Hong Kong Omelet, with sausage, wild mushrooms, onions, Monterey jack and cheddar cheese. Ohmygod. It was delicious and HUGE. The mushrooms were gigantic, like portabella size, because they were diced into big old pieces and you could hardly discern the shape of them. The bacon was thick and crispy and the sausage was also delicious. Mr. Man got it on the side with his breakfast. Let's just say it looked pretty phallic, more like a bratwurst than a little link sausage. You'll feel slightly dirty taking a succulent bite out this sucker.

Which brings me to the homefries. They are quite possibly some of the best side order potatoes I have ever had with breakfast. Crisp, small little squares seasoned to perfection. They were delicious alone, but perfection when sprinkled with hot sauce. I'm salivating just thinking of them right now. They were that freakin' good.

It's a little on the pricey side ($9.25 for my omelet and homefries, $8.25 for eggs, meat and fries) for breakfast, the ambiance kinda sucks, and it's located in the hell of old people infested Scottsdale suburbs (side note- we got to see some old biddy drive down the wrong part of the road, twice!) but their mastery of the breakfast art is truly something to wonder at. If nothing else, go for that. You won't walk away disappointed."}
{"text":"No. not gross, just not very good. the meats are good and taste good, but everything else was not good. potatoes \"home fries\" were very bland and just yuck, eggs tasted weird, bland and underdone, kids pancakes were paper thin, but did taste okay. not a very good menu to start off with and too expensive for the taste and portions. large bill and meh experience, as half of us left still hungry because the food just was not good and its way too loud in there to even hear to visit. service isn't the worst, but not good or friendly and it would be nice if specials and such were told to customers. the baked pancakes and biscuits n gravy (not on menu, didn't even know they had those) looked good, but we wont be back to try, unfortunately."}
{"text":"Food was really good, but the place is super unorganized. Two servers seemed to be the only employees around on a fairly busy Saturday morning. No one taking names or bussing empty tables. 
Note to the business owner. You lose 1/3 of your footprint in wasted space up front. You need someone to redesign the eating area to seat more people. Hire more servers for the additional tables. You'll have happier customers and profits will grow. Your prices are are extremely high as 12-15 tables will barely cover your costs. Just my .02"}
{"text":"We frequently enjoy breakfast out together  at many different places in the area. 

JP pancake is definitely one of our top pics.

The baked pancakes are absolutely phenomenal, but they are very rich.

What we do is order a baked omelette with home-fries and toast and a baked pancake and share the whole meal.

The service is usually great, but when things get busy it can get a little thin, but it is completely understandable. Typical of a small town diner and in the end, they always take great care of you.

Overall, a 5 star place to have a great breakfast."}
{"text":"Feels like a locally-owned family-run joint.

Our first visit was last weekend, and a couple of old farts stole the table we were waiting for... and then told me \"we were here first\" - apparently they didn't notice us waiting by the front door when they walked in. Either way, the staff is really friendly, pancakes are amazing and their omelettes are perfect.

If you're ever in this area check it out. ...and bring a bat for the old people.

UPDATE - Dropped by here a couple times during the week. The weekday experience is plain depressing, it's empty, no atmosphere, one slow waitress with no personality. Hate to say it, but I don't think this will make it. PLEASE clean this place up and turn it around before it's too late - Food alone will not make it. Did ownership change recently? I gave it 4-stars originally."}
{"text":"The baked pancakes are amazing so we were going here fairly regularly for a while. But the service is very slow as they seem to be understaffed. When the kids are hungry the slow service is especially tough as toddlers don't wait very well.  So we started to try just pick up and then eating at the park. But then we had to wait quite a while (up to 15 minutes) just to be greeted and told they would be with us soon."}
{"text":"Delicious food! This is not your typical breakfast place like IHOP or dennys. The food tastes very homemade which is a nice change of pace! The oven baked pancake is a must! We had the orange cranberry and it was delicious! Definitely something to split with someone though because it's very big and very filling!!! The only reason I can't give it 5 stars is the dining room need some work. The decor is cute and farm chic but the tables and the booth seats are falling apart. Take the booth seats out completely and just use chairs, the booth seats are old and you can feel every piece of wood in them when you sit down. And then, take the table cloths off the tables and get some new ones (the ones on the table are tattered and torn). Simple changes like that would make a HUGE difference!! Would definitely return!!"}
{"text":"My son volunteers folding napkins here. He is 22 and has autism. They welcome him with open arms.  

We found this place because we needed gluten free. Great options. Friendly family business. Takes a little time because everything is from scratch - be patient - it's worth the wait."}
{"text":"This place was such a wonderful find! We had family in town and wanted to find something we could all enjoy that wasn't too hoitey toiety, but wasn't bland and turned out like Denny's. I'm not gonna lie, when I first showed up, I contemplated arguing to find somewhere nicer. They have a very plain store front, with lunch specials scribbled in marker taped to the window. But we sat down because some of the best places are hole in the walls. Service was so so. It was pretty busy, so I'm hesitant to take a star off for that, but it was a Sunday morning at 10! Anyhow, outside of the service and appearance, the food was FABULOUS!! The apple baked pancake my mom got was amazing! My build your own omelet was a perfect serving with fresh mushrooms and onions and spinach. The fries are like country fried potatoes with a delectable seasoning. My son devoured his chocolate pancakes. My husband had a mix of everything and was pleasantly plump upon departure. We will totally be back, and hopefully it won't be as busy so service isn't as blah."}
{"text":"Impressed with a cheery hello as soon as we walked in.
 
Then, noticed the booth table needed scrubbing, it was sticky. Ketchup bottle very very dirty, floor dirty, windows dirty. It was a dirty place.

Food good, pancakes nothing special as the name might imply. We might give it another try to see if they have learned restaurant basics, like providing a clean restaurant for customers.

Place needs help."}
{"text":"JP isn't my #1 breakfast stop but I felt I needed to put in my two cents after seeing some pretty harsh reviews. I think it's a decent pancake place. I've been there twice and received good service both times. One time they stayed open a little later so me and a pal could eat. The menu states that their special 'baked pancakes' take 20 minutes to prepare, so if you ordered one of those, be prepared to wait :) I've ordered the griddle pancakes with bananas and nuts. I thought they were filling and yummy! The next time I go I want to check out the baked pancakes. Don't be afraid to check it out for yourself - I think it easily beats the pancakes you'll get at the breakfast chains (ihop, dennys, etc)."}
{"text":"Bought a LS deal-- my hubby and I were starving so we both ordered the french toast that came with bacon and eggs.  The french toast was just OK.  I've made better had home.  On a plus side, everything else was quite good.  Service was great as was the coffee.  As I looked around, I saw many people ordering the signature item, the oven-baked pancake and it looked sooo good!  I really wished I hadn't been so impatient and waited to try it.  At least I found another reason to go back!"}
{"text":"Wow.  I'm not sure if Alicia A is an owner or just crazy but my experience is much more in line with Larry's.  Really slow service and subpar food at OUTRAGEOUS prices.

We showed up on a Saturday morning and were quoted a 20min wait for our party of 3.  That wait only took about 10 mins since a party of 8 ahead of us disappeared.  We were seated in a lonely table in a giant empty orange room that would soon become the waiting room.  After five minutes or so, someone showed up to take our orders.  We put in our orders and waited again.  She eventually brought out our drinks.  Everything here is served in glasses that you would expect to see fresh-squeezed orange juice served in - 6-oz glasses.  Inevitably, these glasses would sit empty for most of our experience.

And what an experience it was! We sat there for 25 minutes waiting for our $8 waffles.  Yes, I said $8 for a waffle.  Mine was chocolate chip.  Giradelli's you ask? No...regular cheap semi-sweets.  How many waffles you ask? Just one.  Was it tire sized? Nope...about 8\" diameter.  Sounds overpriced?  You bet'cha.

So our food finally came.  The waffle was alone.  No toppings, no sides of bacon or hashedbrowns.  Nothing.  Just an $8 waffle sitting on a plate insulting me and my debit card.  It then proceeded to insult my calcium intake by challenging my teeth to Mortal Kombat.  This was the crispiest waffle I had ever seen and that was not a good thing.  No malted creaminess to enjoy.  No love whatsoever. 

Ages went by before we saw a server again.  We were surrounded by waiting patrons who I just wanted to tell - Go Across The Street To The Good Egg!  It was an uncomfortable situation that was only made worse by the pool of yellow liquid under our table and the realization that it never went away even after we told someone to clean it up. Eww."}
{"text":"First time here. We were seated immediately, drinks were served & order taken. And waited for 45 minutes for our meals. Don't get me wrong -- the service was great; the server, though, forgot to expedite our order. He owned up to the error, discounted our bill by 50% & pushed our order through.

I ordered the  Sunshine Combo (2 eggs, 2 pancakes, 2 bacon or 1 sausage) & hubby ordered the Waffle Combo (same as mine only with waffle). They impressed me with their gluten-free options (totally appreciated that!), and the food was so tasty!!! When I commented on how good my pancakes were, the server offered to get hubby a regular pancake sample, which he really enjoyed. 

The five-star rating I gave is a big indication of the server's accountability. He got a good tip, too, for handling it with humor. Pretty sure we'll be back!"}
{"text":"I try to write in depth reviews so others can get a real sense of my experience. But this experience was so very OKAY I don't have much to say so here it goes. 

I ordered: coffee and Sunrise combo: 2 eggs any style 2 buttermilk pancakes and 2 strips of bacon. total cost: $10.25 

The coffee was pretty non descript along with everything else. I feel like they purposefully bought cheap old furniture so it looks like it has been established for 25 years. 

Pancakes had decent flavor but there was no crispness to them, I got my eggs scrambled. They came out as some 4 inch radius circle of scrambled something and very undercooked. Bacon sufficiently crisp. 

The staff was pleasant but I kinda felt like I was being rushed out although there weren't any patrons waiting or coming in. 

I won't be running back."}
{"text":"$7.25 for a breakfast burrito with just eggs and potatoes. NO seasoning whatsoever when they cooked it. If you want bacon in your burrito, it's $1.00 extra. Cheese? That'll be $.50. Way too expensive for food with no flavor. The waitress didn't even ask if everything was ok, so she must know it's awful. Won't be back here."}
{"text":"This place is fantastic. I've never had an oven baked pancake before and it was awesome. I've also had omelette here and the are fresh and delicious. We've  been about back about five times since discovering JP Pancake and we've even taken out-of-towners here for breakfast as well and they loved it too.  It's not the same breakfast you'll find at typical breakfast houses. I don't get the bad reviews I guess they can all go back to Denny's or IHOP.  The art on the wall is sort of creepy though."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I come here probably once a month. The staff is very friendly and we usually get the gluten free French Toast which is soooo good! You can add different fruit if you want. We also get the bacon and home fries which are delicious too. Last time we went, we saw a man get an oven baked pancake which was huge and smelled yummy. 10/10 would recommend. For all the food we get the bill was only around $20 -- definitely not expensive."}
{"text":"Great service and loved the biscuits and gravy."}
{"text":"Slow service, I was going to take a picture of my empty coffee cup on a number of occasions.  Pancakes were good, not great. We just kept waiting,  the experience was excruciating."}
{"text":"I have been here once. They are very expensive for what  you get. A waffle with a few strawberries and a dab of whip cream for 7 bucks. Not even any puree. It's an expensive dive. Why they get great reviews is beyond me or they are family friends of the owner. I will not be back."}
{"text":"I also purchased a Groupon for this place a few months ago and it is set to expire this week.  So I called up a friend to meet me for breakfast today, a Saturday, and started on the 41.9 mile drive from Litchfield Park.  I was on their website yesterday and no where did it say anything about them being closed today, but when I got there all I found was a sign saying they were closed today, but would be open again Sunday.  That didn't really help me since I was so far from home and the Groupon wasn't good on Sundays.  Of course the sign was posted just to the side of the sign on the window that says they are open everyday...except today, I guess.  They also had signs saying they no longer accept Entertainment Book coupons, but if they put themselves in the book, they should honor it.  A third sign states that if you use your credit card for less than $10, they would charge you an extra $1 which is quite a bit more than the percentage they would be charged for a purchase so small.  From what I saw this place is on the fast track to shutting down for good...save your money.  However, The Joyful Chinese place in the same complex was delicious and a great deal for the money."}
{"text":"Happened on this place when I had an early appointment. I  gluten sensitive so you can't imagine how happy I was when I read the menu. Gluten free pancakes, waffles, French toast! I had the French toast with fresh strawberries and whipped cream. Delicious! My husband had two regular pancakes and neither of us could finish our meal. We didn't order the baked pancakes, but we will be back to do that. Yummy!"}
{"text":"I just received an email from the owners saying they just read my review and they are sorry and hope that I'll give JP Pancake another chance since they have new waitstaff.  I thought that was nice of them and I seriously thought about going back.  Then I wanted to read my review again since it's been over 6 months.  That's when I noticed that the same owner that wrote to me also is someone who wrote a \"stunning\" review giving JP Pancake 5 stars.  (A.B.   also known as Amber and Chad Dahl who own JP Pancake)

Now I'm sure it is not against the rules to write a review for yourself, but I kind of think that's like voting for yourself for Homecoming Queen.  I just don't think that's right!  It throws off the ratings of everyone else who is judging your restaurant.  I think it's kind of scummy that they did that.

Now I definitely will not return to this dirty, dingy place.   :("}
{"text":"I had breakfast here today around noon.  Ordered the German Pancake with Lemon and Powdered Sugar, and the French Toast Combo with both Bacon and Sausage, and Scrambled Eggs.  Everything was DELICIOUS, except for the French Toast, which was just average. The German Pancake was AMAZING, and I'll be going back for more.  Service was attentive, and the food only took about 20 minutes to arrive;  they tell you on the menu that the specialty pancakes take that long to prepare.  Worth the wait, I wish they had later hours."}
{"text":"If pancakes are your name they better be good. These are great. All kinds of options and great quality. Recommend ordering the real maple syrup to get the full experience. The only reason I can't give them 5 stars is because of the silverware. It's a pet peeve but eating great food of sharp edged tin forks just takes away from the efforts of the chef to provide a great experience."}
{"text":"Too bad there is no option for zero stars, because this place earned it!  The restaurant was not overcrowded, but it took one hour to be served!  Someone at the next table over dropped a bottle of ketchup, so there was broken glass and splattered ketchup on the floor when I arrived, and it was still there 90 minutes later.  A young man finally came by and wiped up about HALF of the mess!  20 minutes later he tried to get the rest, but there was still broken glass on the floor!  My coffee was cold.  My pancakes were somewhat raw.  My companion ate 1 of 4 pieces of french toast.  The final insult was when they ran my credit card for $0.05 more than the total of the bill!  Enough said."}
{"text":"I came here with a girlfriend with a coupon from the Entertainment book. I am a sucker for pancakes, so I was excited. My friend thought it was great that they offer alot of gluten-free options (including pancakes). I am not gonna lie, I wasn't adventurous enough to go the gluten free route. I had the two egg with french toast breakfast. It came with a choice of bacon or sausage...I chose the sausage link. Easily the most tender sausage link I have ever had....delicious. The eggs weren't anything special but good. I was pretty disappointed in my challah bread french toast. It was way too dense and bland tasting. French toast is one of my favorite things to eat so I was pretty bummed out. The server was really great and attentive. I am fairly certain I wouldn't go back as there are closer breakfast spots to my work that I enjoy way more (Over Easy, Breakfast Joynt)."}
{"text":"We came here specifically for the german pancakes.  Very good!  If you haven't tried them or love them come check this place out!  We also had a green chile omelet, also awesome.  They have a corner with children toys too so its nice while you wait to have a distraction for the kids.  It is a small little place but we were seated with only a short wait.   Very good!"}
{"text":"So sad JP Pancakes closed.   You provided wonderful gluten free food and gooey tasty omelettes. Wishing you good luck on next adventures."}
{"text":"I was excited to have a pancake that I have never experienced before...too bad the wait and service spoiled it.  We had a group of 6 adults and one kiddo.  And it felt like FOREVER that we had to wait in their cramped entrance by the door. 

We signed up on their notepad/sign in sheet with the amount of people we had (no hostess, understandably).  It was a saturday morning, we knew it was gonna be pretty busy.

We finally got sat and they just didn't have enough people at that time to handle the rush.  Any who, I ordered the Carmel Apple Oven baked pancake...it is HUGE.  Very good taste and the apples on the side were great.  Food awesome, wait staff and service not so much."}
{"text":"THIS PLACE IS HORRIBLE!!!!! Do not go!!! We had a GROUPON too like so many other reviewers. 

1st reason not to go: Sign that said certain items on the menu could not be ordered when using a GROUPON. 

2nd reason not to go: Sign that said they will automatically add an 18% tip when you use a GROUPON. That way they can give you the worst service imaginable with no consequences because they know they automatically get a good tip regardless. 

3rd Reason not to go: Sign hat says they no longer accept Entertainment Book Coupons.  I would be really ticked off had I driven all the way there to use one of those coupons only to arrive and be told they are no good. 

4th reason not to go: Sign that says you will be charged $1.00 extra if you use an AMEX.  What the heck? Seriously??!? 

5th reason not to go: Server's appearance was not professional.  She had to be in her late 40s and had pigtails, a headband that looked like it came straight from the 80s, etc.  She looked like a little girl.  Weird. 

If those reasons aren't enough, the store hours are peeling off the window & apparently aren't accurate anyway because they said they closed @ 2pm.  My friend and I arrived at 11:30am for our breakfast & we were totally RUSHED out of there.  The waitress blatantly expressed her displeasure when I ordered a refill of Diet Coke - so much so that it prompted my friend to ask, \"Are you getting ready to close or something?\"  The waitress said yes & that they were usually open until 1pm (Remember, the window's hours said 2pm), but that today they were closing @ noon because they had a piece of kitchen equipment out of order, & they had someone coming to fix it.  It would have been nice of her to mention we'd only be given a 1/2 hr to scarf down our food before we sat down to eat.  I was SO ANGRY!  

I think she was lying about the repair person too because before I even got my newborn baby buckled into his car seat, the waitress turned out all the lights, locked the front door of the restaurant, and all but ran to her car.  She sped off.  If there really was a repair man, wouldn't she need to let him in, wouldn't he need light, etc??!?  I'm convinced she just wanted to leave early.

In conclusion, I very rarely wish ill on a family owned business as my husband and I have a small business ourselves, but I honestly hope the next time I drive by, this place will have gone out of business to save the remainder of the Phoenix Metro population from having a torturous breakfast experience.  

I can't say the food was great either.  After all, I was forced to eat so quickly, I had no time to evaluate its taste."}
{"text":"Food is great but the last time i went the cook was sick and coughing up a storm and was not washing his hands i had to leave with out eating my food."}
{"text":"Baked pancakes were worth the 20 min wait. Atmosphere and service were stellar."}
{"text":"This place has it all.  Awesome food, excellent service, huge portions, and low prices.  A rare gem."}
{"text":"As a Celiac disease guy it is hard to find good gluten free breakfast food. JP Pancake is aware of the gluten thing and has awesome gluten free offerings. Their Belgian waffles are crispy on the outside and moist on the inside. Pancakes are delicious. Neither have that heavy 'gluten free' density that others I have tried at other places had."}
{"text":"First time and last time visit to this place, though the waitress are very friendly and efficient the restaurant was very dirty and don't and I plead to you don't use the rest room it was disgusting.  we both ordered different items on the menu and both were not very good at all . My husband ordered biscuits and gravy and my dogs has thrown up a more appetizing plate. I ordered the breakfast plate I don't know how you can mess up egg whites bacon and potatoes but they did. egg whites were edible but everything else was not potatoes were hard toast was not buttered and the bacon tasted like it was made a day or possible two before . Save your money and pass this place up ."}
{"text":"Service is very slow.... Sitting here waiting on my food...  The food better be good."}
{"text":"Delicious food, friendly service in a great location. Small restaurant that has a perfect breakfast menu. Will gladly return again and again."}
{"text":"I learned about this place thanks to Groupon. The first time I went there was Jan 2 2013. We were on our way to the airport, dad had a flight out around 2 PM. I was pleased to see \"Gluten Free\" options in the menu. I forgot to tell Josh (our server) that we had a tight amount of time to eat. At the end I didn't need to let him know, the food took not long to come out.
The pancakes were great & so the bacon. My family was pleased with the food.
Even though they didn't have PB for my pancakes at that time, I knew I will go back!
Second time around was 1/25 and was very pleased when not only I was nicely greeted but also surprised to learn that now they do have PB!! 
Service was great as the time before and the food yummy!
Yep! I went back next day and took 2 friends along with! For sure I will go back!"}
{"text":"I've driven by a million times, always disappointed when it's closed in the afternoon. . Finally had the chance to try it Sunday morning. I was pleased, the 20 minute wait for a baked pancake seemed excessive but it's the specialty, why not try it. It was delicious and did not take the alleged 20 minutes to arrive (however even after asking I think we got the apple not the pumpkin pancake, which I ordered, it was fabulous regardless just oddly different). The biscuits and gravy weren't my cup of tea (which they do run out of apparently) the gravy was way to think and too many tiny chunks of sausage, my preference is a thick white gravy with substantial sausage chucks, to each his own apparently, tasty just not my preference. . Lastly be warned to read the menu carefully, my husband ordered the sausage breakfast which would include sausage, toast and hash browns in addition to you would expect eggs, but you will have to order them on the side if that's what you expect..Just a helpful hint! I'm gonna have to go back to try the rest of the menu to make a definitive decision, for now I'm on the fence but obviously on the side that's wanting to return so it couldn't have been that bad. . A little pricey for what I feel we received but I will be raving about those damn pancakes for weeks, great now I'm hungry! !"}
{"text":"I would give a 2.5 if possible, but it's not. Took the family here for breakfast and walked in on a Sunday morning at 09:30 to a mostly empty place. We sat ourselves per the sign and the waitress greeted us from a distance and welcomed us in. Unfortunately we waited over 5 mins after that for someone to come over and offer drinks. The coffee was decent but lukewarm. My cup was empty numerous times throughout the entire breakfast. As for the food, it was also decent. They do not sell kids meals (weird) so you have to have a full order of pancakes for your 3 year old unless you want the same thing and share. My omelet was cooked perfect but was missing flavor and seasoning. We also had a baked banana nut pancake and it was good but not anything special. 

Overall the issue with this place is that they have to pull it all together. The staff was very friendly and kind. The food was good but needs some work. The environment is very sterile and they could make the place a little more welcoming. For the prices I feel it is below what you should get as an overall breakfast experience."}
{"text":"Good location decent food a little expensive for what you get but waffles and pancakes were pretty good the place was not crowded which was nice. The seats very uncomfortable the bendable type metal you find at two star hotel convention. Don't take the kids the menu for kid's irrelevant not a lot of choices concrete floor was odd and overall decor needs upgrading. I feel for the guy its hard and expensive I know and I will try again and support local owned and operated."}
{"text":"Vera is a ray of sunshine in the morning! After showing up for the first time last week, she remembered my sister and me, asked about our grandma, and recalled our careers! This is customer service that can't be beat!! 

In addition to Vera and the staff, the food is phenomenal!! Their buttermilk pancakes--which she gave us as free samples last week--are incredible! We've tried their oven-baked pancakes and the French toast, and you can't go wrong!! Great prices, too! 

Plus, the restaurant is just a happy environment. There are inspirational quotes on every table, and Vera has slipped a few family feud cards into the condiment containers so you're never bored waiting for food. Our 92 year old grandma absolutely adored the place, and we're very excited to become regular customers! 

Don't miss this place! It's absolutely amazing, and you won't be disappointed!!"}
{"text":"This was maybe one of the biggest food disappointments I have ever had.  My family lives out in the EV and my mom handed me a magazine that pointed out great places to eat in the EV.  Granted, most of them were chains, but we figured why not give the place that got a cover a shot?  First let me tell you that the cover picture was two beautiful Belgian Waffles stacked on top of each other and loaded with fresh strawberries and yummy whipped cream.

I was enticed by this and chose to order a waffle instead of their namesake.  I got the pecan waffle.  Despite being described as malted and loaded with pecans, I got a box mix tasting waffle with a sprinkling of pecans.  I paid 8 dollars for this?  Wow.  The syrup was imitation syrup and the waffles were irritatingly served on itty bitty plates that made a mess.  I would also like to point out that a friend did get the strawberry waffle and it looked nothing like the cover.  She got maybe one strawberry and a blob of Cool Whip.  Sad.

On top of the terrible food and ridiculous prices, the service was awful!  The restaurant was beginning to clear out by the time we got in, so no excuses.  Our drinks took forever to get to us, and that sat empty for the rest of the meal, our food took forever, and it took us forever to get out of there!  This is an all around issue, not just the waitstaff.  To make matters even better, the atmosphere is laughable.  It looks like they painted the walls, slapped some mismatched Kirkland's crap on the walls and called it a restaurant.

This place is a sham.  I will never be back and I have already told my friends and family to steer clear and save their money."}
{"text":"Location:  Great physical location.  The interior leaves some to be desired but didn't turn us away once we started seeing the food come out.

Menu:  A little odd that many of the meals are a base with add on prices but even with them the prices are appropriate.

Food:  Portions are more than appropriate.  Ordered a breakfast burrito with chorizo, green chiles, cheese and some veggies.  Eggs and potatoes are the base.  The Sriracha on the side is an odd choice, but not the worst.  Forgot to ask if they had Chalula or Tapatio.  Nevertheless the burrito was fresh to order and was filling.  Normally comes with a side of fruit but opted for the pancake.  To my surprise it came with 2 pancakes!  So...fat kid heaven.

The oven baked pancakes look great and the folks next to us had a killer looking omelet and Benedict with potatoes that looked so good I almost changed my order.

Service:  I was initially a little concerned but our server was great and kept refilling our drinks ahead of our needs.  Can't ask for more than that.

In a nutshell, we'll be back.  I rarely give 5 stars and the only thing keeping me doing so on this location is the interior and the presentation of the menu.  I have faith these will be upgraded in time.  Additionally I'd like to try more of the menu but have faith that it's going to not disappoint."}
{"text":"What a hidden gem! I didn't try the baked pancakes but I will definitely be back to try when I have the 20 minutes to wait for one. The food was delicious and the service was prompt. It had a quaint, small time feel. The clientele is oddly bipolar (seniors vs hipsters/hippies), which is interesting. The staff is not overly friendly, which probably comes from the fact that the are very busy and there are A LOT of people crammed into a small place. Expansion could be in the cards here. I would definitely recommend this to my east side friends."}
