{"text":"Stopped in for a lunch with a friend.  She had suggested the restaurant and I was able to pick up a Groupon.  The waiter was very helpful with dish selection and he gave us each a taste of all the different sides.  The food came quickly and was delicious and different.  I would definitely stop here again."}
{"text":"Being from south Florida where there is no shortage of delicious Latin food, I was really (really!) impressed with the quality of food here. Don't hesitate if you are looking for super taste and good prices. The rotisserie chicken is superb...awesome plantains...delicious Chaufa. This is a must-try restaurant!"}
{"text":"The food is good when they get your order right. But the service sucks. The staff members are rude and disrespectful. I will not be going again.  Johnny served us and his tone was condescending and he had a bad attitude. He want very helpful or courteous. Service is key to me when eating out. My chicken was overcooked. It was a bad experience. Why pay money to be treated like crap and not valued as a customer. They wont make it in ballantyne area like that. Save your $ people!! I used to frequent here but they have really gone down in quality. Thanks to johnny they lost one loyal customer. I will be putting that on my foodie blog to share with my members."}
{"text":"Beware! This is NOT the same restaurant as the Pio Pio in Dilworth. Don't ask me how they can have the same name but if you Google Pio Pio Charlotte, the one in Dilworth has a totally different website.  I dine at the Dilworth Pio Pio regularly & it's delicious. Don't let this place deter you from trying it.  I recommended a friend try this new location & told her exactly what to order. They seemed a little confused which I thought was weird. I called Dilworth just to make sure it was the same owners & was told the Lancaster Hwy location is different owners (I asked how they could have the same name but the person didn't know). Then called Lancaster Hwy & asked if they're the same Pio Pio as in Dilworth & they guy replied, \"It's the same food\"...I said, no I want to know if it's the same owners. He said yes. I don't believe that, especially based on the reviews here.  I did some further research & it appears Pio Pio is a franchise so that explains the name. But based on the reviews I won't be trying the other location."}
{"text":"Ate at the Ballantyne location Jan. 12 while in Charlotte visiting my son.  Had a discount voucher purchased from Living Social . After 10 minutes waiting for them to try to figure out how to deal with it I was told for some reason they would not honor the voucher, which is still being sold on the Living Social website.  I easily got a refund but if you want to attract business like this it would help if your employees knew what they were doing!"}
{"text":"New restaurant with lots of room for improvement. The menu presents dishes from a variety of Latinamerican countries, but you can't make Puerto Rican mofongo, the peruvian way! Need to go back to the drawing board and define their flavors and identity. Price didn't quite justify the portions. As far as service, I can say they tried. The place has potential, it's fairly new. Give it a try an you be the judge."}
{"text":"My wife graduated Nursing School so about 15 of us went to Pio Pio afterwards to celebrate.  They put enough tables together to accommodate us and took the orders fairly quickly.  The wait was a little long but the portions were great for $35. we fed 16 people for $230  The delivery of the orders was a little confusing, but we figured it easily.  Each portion could feed 2 to 4 people. Three of us men got together and paid the bill and I gave the servers a 60 dollar tip  The taste was good enough for me to want to come back. We will try the Dilworth location next time as it is closer to our home. My recommendation if you like chicken this is a nice place to get something tasty"}
{"text":"I usually visit Pio Pio bi weekly. By far, my most recent experience (yesterday) was the worst. When I called to Place my phone order, I was quoted a 10 minute wait time. I called in 15 minutes prior to my arrival. I arrived and paid for my order. I waited an additional 15 minutes before I asked the cashier for an update on my order. I waited an additional 5 minutes until I received my \"to go\" order. I arrived home and prepared to eat my meal and was appalled at the appearance and dryness of my chicken. The chicken was not fresh. I was to tired and too far to return and receive a replacement for my food since my family was very hungry. Pio Pio need to step their game up and be consistent!!!"}
{"text":"We visited Pio Pio on a Thursday night for an early dinner. The neutrally decorated restaurant was quiet with only a few booths occupied. The server answered all our questions and since it's our first time, they suggested trying the Latin combo so that we can try a little of everything. What a wonderful idea! The moist roast chicken smelled and tasted delicious! The plantains were sweet and yummy. The salad was crisp and tangy - loved the avocado on top! The yuca fries tasted very good and fresh! Definitely a worthwhile visit!"}
{"text":"I love the concept of Pio Pio but have to agree with previous reviews. There is definitely room for improvement.  We ordered a combination of things to get a feel for what they offered. We tried the Mofongo with pork. It was tasty but on the dry side.  I went for the half chicken which was okay. I could taste a slight marinade of garlic and some citrus and it had a good golden color but it probably could have stood to marinate longer. My meal also came with a corn cake which is called an arepa and it was slightly burnt on the outside and bland and dry on the inside. They may benefit to take it off the menu until they can improve that recipe.    The actual show stoppers are their sides and sauces. I went bananas over their beans and rice,  chicken soup, and those little containers of sauce you get to dip the chicken in are garlicky, spicy, and perfect. They pretty much saved the meal which is a shame for the chicken that is supposed to be the star player.    As for our service, it was good but we went during a slow period iin the middle of the day. We met the owner and found him to be very charming and a great host.  So all in all I am not rushing back to Pio Pio but I would definitely return being more conservative with my meal selection. I am certainly rooting for their success."}
{"text":"A friend and I went here for Lunch on Sunday.  The food was okay but nothing special.  You definitely get your money's worth though."}
{"text":"Wonderful food & fast service! Loved the Latin combo & Tres Leches!!"}
{"text":"After reading some of the other reviews I was a little concerned when my dad suggested we visit Pio Pio in Ballantyne. I think they maybe have read these reviews and got their stuff together a little more. I didn't have any issues when i went.  The restaurant was a little small with about 20 tables. It was cute and cozy with some great spanish music playing. From time to time i found myself dancing in my seat.   My parents ordered one of the combo specials with chicken, yucca, rice and beans. The chicken was tender and tasty. My family absolutely loved the beans and even ordered seconds. The second order of beans was delivered by the owner shortly after ordering it. He made sure we were being well taken care of.  I ordered the arroz con pollo with plantains and was a little disappointed but only becauseIi was comparing it to my mom's. It was definitely tasty but at times i felt like I was on an Easter egg hunt. With every fork full of rice i would find a new ingredient such as green beans, or vienna sausage looking things, or corn. It was certainly an interesting meal.The plantains were sweet and delicious.    I think i would go back if i was hungry for some tasty chicken."}
{"text":"I love the food here! I've never actually eaten inside the restaurant, but I've gotten takeout about 5 times now, and I've never been disappointed. My favorites are the guacamole and tostones, chicken soup and the rice. Each of these things I could eat over and over again and not get tired of. Before coming here, I never had guacamole with tostones. I am a big fan of guacamole in general, but I had never tried to eat it with anything other than chips. I must say the tostones are delicious and give a pleasant chewiness that chips don't have. Also, the chicken soup is very flavorful! I love soups of all kind, but I usually think chicken soup is boring. Not this one! All the different ingredients like the plantains, corn and cilantro work well together and make it more unique than your standard chicken soup."}
{"text":"Yum. Just yum. The Chaufa is great and the 1/2 chicken plate feeds two people. Great value, great service, tasty food. I love I found this place!"}
{"text":"My husband and I are new to Charlotte and North Carolina as we've recently moved from NYC. I love Peruvian food and was searching for something authentic. Pio Pio fit the bill!  Lovely ambiance, friendly and hospitable staff and delicious food. Since it was our first time, I stuck with the Pollo ala Brasa and hubby had the Pollo Saltado.  My chicken with rice and beans was delish and the salad that came with it was fresh and the dressing tasty.  Hubby who rarely deviates from rotisserie chicken, literally cleaned his plate and announced it was delicious; another rarity. Upon leaving he told them we would be back!  Pio Pio satisfied my search!"}
{"text":"Now that we know the quality of food, definitely will be back! Fresh and fast Peruvian cuisine and doesn't feel like a chain"}
{"text":"Just got back from having lunch at Pio Pio.  I was excited to have some Lomo Saltado for lunch and I headed to Pio Pio for the first time since it got good reviews on Yelp.  I try to be fair with my reviews and I'll do the same here......  I was very disappointed with my experience at Pio Pio today.  Upon arriving a little before Noon, I noticed there was only one big party of at least 10 people seated.  A waiter showed me to my seat and quickly got my drink and took my order.  The place is clean and pretty nice.  The waiter brought out two dipping sauces.  One was pretty spicy and the other was a little milder.  I liked them both, so it was cool.  Shortly thereafter, my favorite Peruvian dish was brought out, Lomo Saltado!!  Man, I love this dish!!  At least the one I used to get at Misti's in Port Chester, NY.    Simply put..... The dish is made up of fries, rice (usually white, but they served it yellow) topped with beef strips sauteed in onions and tomato.  The problem with the dish is that it was literally tasteless!!  I mean, I poured some salt and pepper on it and it simply tasted like.................. nothing.  I poured some of the dipping sauces and this at least added some heat to the dish.  I was very dissapointed to say the least.  I don't compare it to what I used to get in NY because I know every restaurant uses different seasoning, but c'mon man!!  :).  I will give this place another try though..... I know Peruvian Pollo a la Brasa is very good, so I will eventually go back and try their chicken, but I don't plan on ever getting the Lomo Saltado again."}
{"text":"I went to Pio Pio in Dilworth two days prior and decided that since I live closer to this one to try this. Worst customer service ever! The young lady proceeded go tell me that I didn't say I wanted white meat but she would fix it for 75 cents more. She then proceeded to tell the cook that I didn't ask for white meat. She was nasty from the beginning. If Pio Pio wants to be successful at this location as they are in Dilworth the need a staff over haul. I'd rather drive 30 minutes for better customer service."}
{"text":"After I lot of bad food experiences I have to say this place gets 5 stars! The atmosphere was great the food was excellent,the smell from the kitchen when we walked in was delicious.we were seated immediately during lunch. We also had a friendly waitress and food was served in a timely manner I enjoyed the chicken with pintos rice and plantains. Kudos to the cook don't change a thing 2 thumbs up  I am also a very picky eater so coming from me this is outstanding. My husband and I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Great food, empanadas, the chicken is so delicious. I have a baby girl and always I order chicken soup for her and she love it.  I high recommend this restaurant for Colombian food very natural and healthy."}
{"text":"We've either ordered out or eaten here a few times. The chicken is juicy and slips right off the bone. The tostones, beans, and sauces are all pretty good.  My family is from P.R. so the food is a bit like home cookin' for me. The rice is a little bland, but overall I would recommend this place."}
{"text":"I have been there twice now.  The first time I had never eaten this type of cuisine and the waitress did only a fair explanation of the menu when asked specifically.  The food was EXCELLENT.  The service is terrible.  I had two different servers on my two visits but they were similar experiences.  Horrible.  Lack of customer service, no greeting, no interest, no follow up, drinks left empty for half the meal.  I do not think they have hired one experienced server yet!  I would like for this business to exceed BUT if their service doesn't improve I will not return.  Please get it together."}
{"text":"I love their Dilworth but the drive was too long for me. I am glad they open this new location. Their chicken and spicy sauce are great, ah and don't forget the empanadas!"}
{"text":"Great salads and great chicken!  It's a great place to stop by after work to pick up good for the family. They take good care of you if you eat in too. You can actually eat pretty healthy here if you are looking to.  The kids love the rice and the yucca."}
{"text":"The Rotisserie chicken and plantains are just as delicious as the East Blvd location. I'll be back."}
{"text":"Delicious!  We love their chicken, red beans & rice, plantains, salads; all tasty, moist!  Good service A+"}
{"text":"The food was decent but this Pio Pio Ballantyne location just lost a customer for poor customer service. They didn't have my call in order despite me checking prior to the end of the order that it was the Ballantyne location. Additionally, I had a coupon for daily lunch special that the staff refused to honor. They called who assume is the manager and refused to express weather the coupon was good or not. Then they asked if their establishment was the correct location when the coupon clearly had their address listed. The special was for there #1 quarter Dark and 2 sides. Needless to say, they lost a customer over a side of plantains and poor service."}
{"text":"Everything is delicious!  My favorite is the grilled chicken, plantains and beans and rice!  I haven't had these since I lived in Miami.  Authentic!"}
{"text":"Got door dash and the food came warm and with all the sauces! It was fresh and delicious."}
{"text":"Recently my next door neighbors, my wife and myself had dinner at the Ballantyne location. My neighbors had eaten there a few times before, but it was our first time. It was also my first time dining at a \"Peruvian\" restaurant. I ordered some Tostones with guacamole, shared it with my wife. I'm choosy about my guacamole and I was not let down. It was 5 star guacamole. My main dish consisted of strips of beef mixed with brown rice, bits of mushroom and onion. This was an ideal dish for me in that it contained ingredients that I enjoy all the time. I liked the tostones, too. They're fried Plantains although the taste reminded me of potato- nothing wrong with that. The food was all just great, however there are problems with the service. The servers seem to be very young, inexperienced in their work and also in the English language. I paid by credit card and when they came out to give me my bill, they said that my Visa was not being accepted. I automatically assumed that I had done something wrong with my Visa card that I had just used at a gas station hours before. So, I leave there with a \"block\" on my Visa card because the young and inexperienced server(s) did not run the credit card properly. So, expect great food, pay in cash, and learn a few words in Spanish before you go. Return visit to Pio Pio April 15, 2014.   Returned to Pio Pio this past Wednesday. Again the star of the show was Guacamole! I ordered a breaded chicken dish which was tasty but a bit dry. I did not find any decent sauce to put on it. Service this time was better and I avoided complications that may have arisen with my Visa card by paying in cash."}
{"text":"Great food. Great atmosphere. Highly recommended. The beef empanadas are amazing as well as the roasted chicken special. A must!"}
{"text":"Fantastic food!! I love the arroz con pollo--chicken and rice plate with plantains and yucca appetizer. The chicken soup was fabulous--chunks of Potato, basil, chicken, corn. Amazing on a cold day! They have a great service and friendly staff."}
{"text":"Not much of a crowd for lunch.  Bread on sandwich was fresh and paired nice with whatever sauces that got plopped on our table as we waited for order.   Steak sandwich was on this bread and meat was over cooked, chewy and not flavored much.  No condiments on sandwich, so without the sauces e's it would have been below average.  Got Yuca fries, that consisted of five little fries   Sad.  Left hungry and my order was 10.00 +"}
{"text":"We had lunch on a Saturday, and practically had the place to ourselves, as we were having a very late lunch.   The place is nice, clean, bright and bathrooms were impeccable. They have a nice bar, probably for the younger crowds in the evenings.  The location was great, we are new to the area, and it was easy to find.   There was nice background music (we try to avoid places with loud music when we eat).    We ordered the  Latin (?) combo, Rotisserie chicken, maduros, large green salad, rice and beans and......, salchipapas (mix of French fries with hotdogs.... not my idea, but my nephew's).   The Chicken was nice and the little green sauce (aji) was feisty and good.   The  Lomo Saltado (beef stir fry) was nicely seasoned but the beef was not tender at all.   We ordered plenty of Inca Kola and some \"manzana\" sort of an apple soda, that the kids loved.  Price was fair and we had plenty of food to share, 3 adults and 2 children.  Will definitely return."}
{"text":"The best Peruvian rotisserie chicken in town. The chicken is perfectly roasted with flavorful spices. It's moist and tasty and fragrant !! They have several location in Charlotte. The restaurant is clean and service is fast. I especially love their green sauces for the chicken. It's spicy and tart from the lime and fragrant from the cilantro. Can't stop eating the chicken once you dipped it on their spicy green sauce."}
{"text":"Never tried latin before was very good! Friendly waitress helped describe menu. The 1/2 rotisserie chicken was tasty and not dry. The Polo Saltado had great flavor and loved how it was cooked in pieces. Great place will visit again!"}
{"text":"Not the same as the pio pio on east blvd. different owners, completely different food. I was super excited because I love the other location & assumed it was the same but was really disappointed in the food. The service wasn't great either. Won't go back here again. You should def go to the east blvd location tho!!"}
{"text":"Pio Pio is a chain and I started going to it when I loved in Florida. When we moved here three years ago, Pio helped us get through being home sick.  I love the white sauce and put it on everything.  The soup rocks and the yucca is fantastic.  Makes me remember that I'm Latina in a Southern world."}
{"text":"Great food! Inexpensive Island food in Charlotte.. The fish was a wonderful experience. I look forward to returning..."}
{"text":"Enjoyed a yummy lunch using Ballantyne discount card for a great deal. Chicken soup was full of flavor with big pieces of chicken. Quarter chicken was crispy and juicy"}
{"text":"We love the rotisserie chicken and skirt steak with Chimichurri. A low key locale with excellent food!"}
{"text":"I don't often get to Ballantyne, but when I do this is a must.  I had the the half chicken, rice, and tostones. The level of care in that meal was the best I've experienced in Charlotte.  Restaurant very clean , service was knowledgeable and attentive."}
{"text":"I have been wanting to try this place out since it opened and finally got a chance today.  When my co-workers and I arrived at lunch time, they were not busy...only 2 other tables of diners. The decor is comfy and welcoming and the place smelled great.   I chose the 1/4 roasted white meat chicken. This comes with yellow rice and red beans with a side for $9.50 at lunch.  For $1 more, I substituted black beans for the red beans.  I chose sweet plantains as my side dish.   The chicken was absolutely delish! It was juicy and flavorful. The yellow rice was a bit on the bland side, but tasted better when eaten with the black beans, which were seasoned nicely.  The plantains were yummy. I didn't try the garlic sauce, but the jalepeno sauce was tasty - not a lot of bite, but nice flavor.     Our service was ok... not outstanding but adequate. Overall, I was quite pleased with my meal and my co-workers enjoyed theirs as well.  I am looking forward to going back."}
{"text":"Although the food is good here the service is absolutely horrible!  Standing at the door and waiting to be seated and NO ONE acknowledges at all.  A simple hello would suffice. One waitress just walks by and rolls her eyes and the other looks up from the register and goes back to what he's doing.  I feel the Ballantyne location is sub-par to their other location.  I definitely won't be dining any time soon.  Rather do take-out from now on!!"}
{"text":"Had heard great things about the East Blvd location, so settled for the location a little closer to our side of town. Have plenty of friends who rave about the Latin fare so we expected good things. While I can say the food was interesting, flavorful, and unique, the service was a little lackluster.   We ordered a few apps: Corn cake, cheese empanadas, and the cold potato dish. The corn cake was rather bland and slightly burnt, but if you add either of their hot sauces it turns into magic. The empanadas are pretty standard and nothing groundbreaking. The potato dish is where our interest was focused. Such an interesting cheese and cream sauce that was slightly spicy, subtle and odd all at the same time. I think the temperature is what made it so interesting. Would recommend this to anyone.   My entree was a little confusing. It was a rice dish....that literally was fried rice...I was a little curious since there is an Asian restaurant next door, but laughed it off. Just a bit odd to taste something like this from a Latin place.   The service was also really spotty. Not too attentive for a Saturday evening. Drinks were a bit low throughout most of the meal, but not a huge deal. All in all, I'd come back, but would most likely look to visit the other location on East."}
{"text":"Food is awesome! Service need a bit of improvement. However, I'm a big foodie if the food is really good I can compromise a bit lol."}
{"text":"I went there for lunch time with a co-worker and it was a little busy, so I decided to order my food to go. However, after about 2mins I realized that all the people in front of me were actually one group, so I asked the server how long it would take to be seated and he said about the same amount if I take it to go. So I said we will just dine in then. After waiting about 30mins to be seated, they bring all food in the boxes still and serve us at the table. I said can the food be put in plates? The server replied \"Since you ordered your food 'To Go' it's still in boxes\" and then just walked away. Since we didn't have that much time left for lunch, we just decided to eat really quickly so we could get back to work. But this was very disappointing and somewhat offensive, as I don't think I should even have to ask that question in the first place. The whole point of dining-in is so that you can sit down and enjoy your meal at the whichever restaurant you go. It was very awkward to be eating out of boxes when everyone else had plates, etc...   The second issue I had, was after I finished eating I asked for a glass of water (I didn't order anything to drink initially). Right after I asked for my water, about 3 groups finished eating and went to pay at the same time. So, instead of getting my water the server started to ring up every single person in line. And it seemed like they were all paying separately.   So not only did I have to eat of of boxes like an animal or neglected step children, compared to everyone else, I was neglected again and had to wait for everyone else to be tended to first. I ended up just walking out and just got some water when I got back to work. And for the record the manger was the one that brought out our food in the boxes. So he was very much aware of it.  For these two reasons I give one star. The food is good, but I felt somewhat neglected and not appreciated as a customer."}
{"text":"Poor customer service...  Staff members are rude.   There was miscommunication with a voucher my guests and I had and what the server clarified at the beginning.  It was a different story when my guests and I got the bill.  The rude gestures came from a male also working at the restaurant (was at the front counter most of the time), when he started insulting my guests stating, \"can you not read?\" and other inappropriate remarks.         I enjoyed the food I had (#4) and I was looking for catering options for an event in Charlotte.  I asked if an exception could be made since we were wanting to be returning customers, the male worker said he'd ask the manager... turns out the manager was only on the phone and was a very quick phone call.       Decided to go to this location since it was closer than the Dilworth chain. (rude gentleman worker said that both locations are owned by same person.  is this true?)   I will definitely not be coming back or doing any business with this restaurant again.  I do not recommend dining in at Pio Pio."}
{"text":"This was our first visit to Pio Pio for a late lunch and had an enjoyable experience! We were greeted by a friendly staff member who promptly seated us in an otherwise empty restaurant....three other diners.   After perusing the menu, we asked a number of questions and made our decisions. My Bride and I both ordered the rotisserie chicken. She ordered her bird with fries and a side salad.  I ordered the beans & rice, the ripe plantains, fried yuca and tostones.  Our server was patient and informative and made our experience satisfying.  Our chicken was a generous portion of flavorful moist chicken (white meat).  The salad and fries weren't notable nor were the beans and rice. The ripe plantains were flavorful and moist. The fried yuca was bland except for the dipping sauce which could jazz up a hockey puck. The tostones were equally unmemorable except for the dipping sauces.  The staff is welcoming and helpful, the chicken flavorful and moist and the side......just sides but worth a try!"}
{"text":"I stopped in for the first time today. I ordered Rotisserie chicken take-out. I was disappointed to find that they didn't serve ceviche as the online menu had listed. The restaurant was completely empty so I can only imagine that it was too early for crowds.   The food was good. I was disappointed with the sauce provided for the chicken. Viva Chicken has better sauces. The rice, beans and plantain were very good. I will definitely come back to try more."}
{"text":"Happened to be in the area for a swim class and thought we would give Pio Pio a try. Best chicken in Charlotte?  I dare say pretty good...  The sides, sauces, and service were all great as well.   They serve Lavazza coffee as well. Good all around."}
{"text":"Love this place.   I used to eat at the one in Queens NY all the time and when I saw this place here I immediately dined there.  It is a great place,  food is fantastic,  I always say I'm going to try something different but end up with the chicken again and again."}
{"text":"The food is reasonably priced, well-prepared, and flavorful. I would go more often if I had a reason to go by it more frequently."}
{"text":"Gracias, Pio Pio! You guys were amazing today. Thank you for hosting our event today. The food was fantastic and your staff went above and beyond in serving and accommodating us!"}
{"text":"I just picked up my to go order and when I got home they forgot half a chicken. When I called they said they had forgot to pack it.  I drove back to pick it up, they didn't offer and reparations for their mistake. Also they didn't have my name for the order when I got there the first time.  Do not order"}
{"text":"New to Charlotte and am starting to explore the Ballantyne area a little since I work over here. Was looking for a little ethnic food and discovered this place.  Pio Pio is the bomb. I've already been there three times this week and I just discovered it on Tuesday. The yelp photos and reviews just don't do it justice. The place is very clean, open with good ambiance and has outdoor seating. They also have a full bar and TVs. Seems like a good place to be if you're looking for some good food and to possibly catch a buzz.  The food is fantastical. I love the chicken soup and arroz con pollo. The soup has a great broth and is always packed with veggies like corn and potatoes, plus plantains. The chicken is tender and moist and they sprinkle fresh cilantro on top. Mmmm. The arroz con pollo is what really rocks though. If you've never had peruvian, this is a great beginner's dish. I just love it because it's one of my comfort foods. They give you a good portion of rice, mixed with veggies and shredded chicken. It's seriously so good. Even kids will probably like it. Drizzle some of the green sauce on top for a kick...but beware, that stuff is potent.   The service was also really good. The staff is very attentive and they even let me switch out fries for soup with my entree.   If you're in Ballantyne, try this place. You'll love it."}
{"text":"Quite frankly, this unassuming little Latin American joint serves up the best rotisserie chicken in Charlotte (and yes, I mean the BEST, which I rarely say about anything - check my record!) Their two housemade dipping sauces only add to its glow, just beware the light green one as it is jalapeño based. The servers warning that it is indeed hot should not go unheeded.   Although my wife and I have dined here dozens of times, I can provide only one recommendation but it's all you need. Order the quarter chicken with rice, beans and plantain. All the sides are fantastic but in particular, the plantain is perfectly fried and caramelized. My only other strong recommendation is to add a side salad for $3.50. It is always crisp, refreshing and comes crowned with freshly sliced avocado, all lightly doused with its delicious in house vinaigrette. We enjoy it as much as we enjoy the chicken.  The sanitary rating is always in the very high 95s and the atmosphere is quaint and comfortable. One important note however, if they happen to be playing hip-hop or rap just ask them to change it to the traditional Latino music. It's amazing how that can either add or detract from your overall experience.  Now about the service... Yes, it can be sketchy but most of the time it is very friendly and attentive. Don't tell them, but even at its worst, I'm a return customer. This place is a Gotta Try."}
{"text":"Wonderful Peruvian food, loved the yucca, I ordered almost one of everything to try it out and really enjoyed the empanadas. There is a Groupon out there I think or Restaurant.com. Must try!"}
{"text":"We visited on Saturday night.  We practically had the place to ourselves at 8pm.  It was our 1st visit and since it was empty, I was skeptical to say the least.  However, the food was VERY good.  The chicken is very flavorful and was not dry.  The salad with rotisserie chicken on top was more than I could eat and the garlic dressing was awesome.  My husband had chicken, rice, beans and salad--all very good.  Please go and enjoy!"}
{"text":"I've been here a few times(about 4). The food is usually very good but I was disappointed in the chicken. It tasted \"microwave-ish\". The plantains were delicious as well as the rice and beans. Their Sangria is the best that I have tasted since I've been in Charlotte. I've never seen it busy; maybe because of it's discreet location...which could be a plus for some. The staff was friendly but could use a little pick me up, they were very blah and dry. I think maybe they should incorporate some Latin music to the atmosphere."}
{"text":"The first dining experience here. The restaurant is in a small modern strip mall and has a nice atmosphere. Not very crowded and the food was very tasty.  The waiters were friendly and professional but absent a warning about the green sauce we had a great meal.  My wife poured the green sauce all over her salad and burned the s%$t out of her mouth. Halfway through her meal she was able to taste again and as a bonus, I finished her salad which was hot but I enjoyed it nonetheless. I had the skirt steak and the plantains were very good as well.

{"text":"Great food in a casual atmosphere.  The food is very fresh and tasty.  They focus on simplicity with freshness and quality and aren't hiding any low quality ingredients with added sauces or unnecessary ingredients as some other restaurants do.  Overall, a good dining experience if quality, authentic food is your goal."}
{"text":"Prompt service.  Excellent food .  Unsweetened tea not so good.  First visit, and will be returning."}
{"text":"My first, and most likely the last time coming to this place. Unlike some other reviews, I did not have an issue with rudeness of the staff. But my pet peeves are  other customer service related issues, like WiFi access. I am trying to connect to the locked signal, I asked my waitress (Ruby) for the password, and she said she doesn't know. She said it's for the credit card machine only. Seriously??? Com on!!! What place in Ballantyne does not have a free WiFi now days. If the Sam's clubs, McDonalds and grocery stores have it, why wouldn't they.....anyway, like I said, my little pet peeves. Decor was inviting. I thought it could have been little busier for a lunch, perhaps if it was run differently. For lunch, food was little bit on the expensive side. Most dishes are above $10. I know that prices are going up in that direction, but most places are trying to still keep the numbers in single digits. Food was decent, but the whole experience does not deserve double digit price. As for my dish, lunch menu item #2, chicken soup with plantain, rice and avocado. The combination just didn't work for me. Individually each item tasted OK, but I was not sure what to eat with what. Perhaps I just don't understand Peruvian food. Too much cheap starch. Soup was little on the salty side, with few pieces of chicken, potato and yucca. Than, once I am done with soup, eating bland rice with plantain was like eating a white bred with doughnuts. I suppose that avocado was there to bring some color on the plate. Another detail, my pet peeve (as I get older, I get more and more of those - old fart) avocado vas not even taken out of its shell. I see that as not very hygienic, especially when the the shell still had a PLU sticker on it. It was probably taken out of the box, never washed, cut in half and put on my plate. Maybe it was washed, but the way it was presented to me in the plate, I am tempted to believe that it was not. Serving avocado in a shell, to me spells lazy, sloppy an not creative. If it was taken our of the shell, they might have gotten one more star. I ask myself, should be going there again? I can only answer that with another question...why? So many other choices..."}
{"text":"The sign said new owners... and from reading the reviews below, I'm guessing these new owners are much better than the previous ones.  We tried this place on a whim and we are happy we did.  It was great.  The food was fantastic!  I had the Montanero, which had an assortment of meats and sides and my wife had the skirt steak.  Both were delicious.  We'll be going back for sure."}
{"text":"Probably about the worst delivery food I have ever had. The calamari was a huge order with  90% tentacles. Just subpar. I got another dish that was supposed to be a corn cake with pork. All it was was a corn tortilla and something unidentifiable. Then the dish that I thought would be the safest which was the steak with plantains and beans. Well look at the photo and tell me if that looks like anything appetizing. Terrible terrible terrible."}
{"text":"This place was an alternate option and ended up being a great decision. We will definitely be back. I had the arroz con pollo and omg was it delish!!"}
{"text":"The service here was atrocious. We stopped in for dinner earlier, and as others have noted, the place was empty. The male server was OK but acted like we were an afterthought. I asked him about Happy Hour and he seemed to have no idea what I was talking about.   The female server didn't even TRY to pretend like she cared. My simplest requests seemed TO. TAKE. SO. MUCH. EFFORT. Really. I haven't seen this level of apathy in a long, long time in a restaurant settting. These people clearly do NOT like their jobs and it makes me wonder what is going on with the restaurant if wait staff can be THIS miserable - especially when only two customers are in the place, and so many others have also commented on the poor service? Unhappy employees are usually a reflection of poor management.  The food was OK. I was a little shocked that when I asked for chimichurri sauce I was given a bowl of the stuff, charged $2.50, and it contained jalapeno peppers. I lived and studied in Peru (and have spent time in other Andean countries), and have never seen jalapeños in anything. The breaded chicken breast was thin, bone dry and utterly devoid of flavor. The rice was decent. The yuca fries were dry and bland.   Pio Pio, I hope you figure out your issues. Especially why your staff is so miserable. We couldnt wait to get out of there tonight. The energy was so flat and negative."}
{"text":"Great food. Terrible service. We should've ordered to go. We would've probably gotten better service that way. It's been a long time since I went without leaving a tip, but this was a situation completely deserving of a negative review. I would leave two stars because the food was well prepared. But the time we spent waiting for service in addition to the food coming our way behind other clients in the restaurant we almost feel appalled to be treated as if we weren't paying customers. After ordering the food and a long wait we requested an appetizer and were told that we cannot place the order because it was too late. Thank you but no thanks"}
{"text":"This place is my new favorite local joint, and go-to place for a local, casual business lunch.    You have to start with the Tostones and guacamole.  I am the kind of person that loves to try different things, but I have gone several times now and ordered the same thing: the 1/4 chicken and salad.  It is a home run.  This location hasn't had a ton of luck but I am really hoping Pio Pio makes it at this location because this has all the things I love: healthy options, great food, and good service.  Definitely worth checking out."}
{"text":"I enjoy this location, well because it's location....I live across the street. I tend to order and go so my say on dining in is not accounted for. I used to go to the location in Dillworth and would dine in the location since it was a far drive.   I come from a long bloodline of Colombian rice and bean meals and I truly enjoy them here. I also like their soups. I would definitely say try this one or both locations out."}
{"text":"I absolutely LOVE this place. The food is absolutely amazing. Everything is so delicious, my picky toddler even eats everything that I put on her plate. Great food, quality, value, service, and taste all deserve 5 stars. I only wish there was a location closer to my home."}
{"text":"My favorite place for chicken and tostones,  I keep ordering the same thing because I know it's always delicious,  I can't help it.  Service is great and I'm here once a month for lunch.  Now I'm hungry just thinking about it.   1/2 chicken with rice and beans and of course fresh tostones with their special hit sauce."}
{"text":"Stopped in the Lancaster highway location today for lunch. Purchased a Groupon to soften the blow. We walked in after the lunch rush and the place was completely empty. Something we do not have a problem with at all. The waiter was pleasant enough.   I ordered the soup of the day, which was  chicken and it was awesome. My entree was breaded steak, tostones,  rice and beans. The steak lacked a flavor, but it may be because Peruvians use lots of sauces as compliments with their cuisine. The beans and rice were very tasty.  My wife ordered the grilled steak, maduros and rice and beans. Once again the steak lacked flavor. In our opinions.  If this location wasn't so out of the way for us, I could see maybe stopping in for takeout. But otherwise than that, not sure if we would visit pio pio again"}
{"text":"I reluctantly review this place, because I want small businesses to succeed, and despise chain restaurants.  But honest, I must be.  Since I live close by, I had seen a \"Coming Soon\" banner draped on the side of the restaurant for a while.  Can't wait for it to open!  Sadly, my dinner here was a big disappointment.  The very young server took our order, and five minutes later returned to take our order again.  Sweet mistake, I suppose.  Unfortunately, the food sucked.  I had the shrimp ceviche, which was downright awful.  The main combo platter was huge; called Bandeja Paisa, it consisted of a grilled steak, egg sunny side up, pork belly, spanish sausage, rice and beans, ripe plantains, avocado, and corn cake.  With the exception of the fried egg, everything else must've been leftovers from last night!  Dried meat, tasteless and chewy.  I do hope this place gets its act together.  After all, it just recently opened and is probably finding its footing.  It is very encouraging to see ethnic restaurants open in Ballantyne, or Charlotte for that matter.  So I am rooting for this place, and I hope you forgive me for the 1-star review.  Perhaps a return visit in the near future will change my rating of this place.  Good luck, Pio Pio!"}
{"text":"I unfortunately visited this place on October 11th..  for a special dinner date with my husband and daughter.. they handed me 3 broken high chairs.. Then I wanted a Jalea anyone that has had these before.. they are suppose to come with Calamari, shrimp and other seafood items. This restaurant only offers fish and calamari. So I decided to go with Ceviche. What was that for the fish tasted old, had no lemon flavor.. no red onions in it and the piece of sweet potato in it was a joke! My husband ordered a lomo saltado thinking they cant cook that wrong. well it was bland had no flavor it was HORRIBLE.. Worst $30.00 I ever spent. Then when I got home I was super sick throwing up, full blown **STOMACH VIRUS** all weekend!!! I have been trying to get a hold of the owner since Saturday morning. Since the manager of the store says they cant make decisions on refunding customers. Still no luck! DON'T SPEND YOU $$ ON THIS FAKE PERUVIAN RESTAURANT!!"}
{"text":"Great food and location. The staff weren't too friendly but no big deal."}
{"text":"The Best Yuca Fries Ever! My fiancé and I decided to have lunch here. 12Noon, I expected a long wait for the lunch. No Wait--We were seated immediately. Once we made our decisions, our food arrived within 10mins.   I was surprised, the Lunch portions are huge!! We had plenty to take home. I ordered the Number 4: Rotisserie chicken, Yuca fries, a side rice and beans. I also ordered a side of Plaintain's(another large portion). The Rotisserie Chicken is EVERYTHING!!!! The flavor is awesome!!! I wish I had more yuca fries (still thinking about it)   The food here is Delish!! This is my second time trying Peruvian cuisine. I need to come here more often. Pio Pio is definitely a hidden gem!!!!! Not sure if this place is family owned, thumbs up to the Chefs on duty!"}
{"text":"Great Guacamole, My favorite is the skirt steak that they serve with beans and rice - fries"}
{"text":"While the entrees have been good the deserts leave something to be desired.  I have tried both the flan and tres leche and have to say they need to work on them.  Several other Latin restaurants in the area are better.  The service is ok but they also need to work on the customer service.  Not as friendly as they could be and pay very little attention to the customers needs after serving the food.  I will probably come back when the family wants to go but it would not be my first choice."}
{"text":"This is my first ever review of a restaurant and the only reason I feel compelled to write this is because the utter lack of service I experienced today at this Pio Pio.  I have been to this restaurant menu times before and even though they've never been the friendliest of people they were completely rude this evening.  My family and I sat down and waited for our waiter but one never came out until I asked 'Do we have a waiter?' and 2 minutes later this woman came out who already had a terrible attitude.  We placed our order right away as we have been here many times and already know what we like from the menu and we sat and waited for close to 15-20 mins before our food came out. This probably doesn't sound too bad except typically our food is ready in less than 10 mins after ordering in the past. I asked the waiter ' is there a problem?' and I received a snipe response..'the food is coming' in a very unprofessional way.  Lastly, right before leaving, I asked for the owner's name and how to get a hold of him...\"His name is Ryan but he's in and out and we never know when he'll be here but you can try calling the other location and ask for him\". This was the most dismissive response I've ever received from someone who clearly doesn't care at all whether I'm a dissatisfied customer or not. I did try calling the other location but, surprise surprise, the number displayed (704-379-1911) doesn't work... It rings and rings and no one ever answers. I guess if I was an actual customer trying to place an order I'd be out of luck.  Ryan, if you're reading this, please know that you have lost a customer - not because of your food, which is excellent, but because of the very very bad staff and service you have at the Ballantyne location. Please do something about this ASAP"}
{"text":"Can't say I was impressed with this place. We've heard good things about it and got some take out for a larger group. Well, the chicken wasn't well cooked, the meat was pinkish, it also lacked flavor. Couldn't be more bland in my book. Same with the sides, the yucca fries are just a big french fries, their salads could use fresher lettuce and more vegetables.  Customer service wasn't the best either, they used to give you the house sauces (they're not great, but you need something to give your food some sort of kick) from behind the counter, now it's \"do it yourself\" and that took some time to put together.  Pio Pio has lots of room for improvement."}
{"text":"This is one of those places we've passed by for years - we finally decided to stop this weekend and it was quite tasty!!! It wasn't busy at all (which can be worrisome). The unsweet tea tasted a little beyond its expiration, but the tostanes and flavors were amazing. Our son devoured his chicken fingers and left a TON of French fries because he was genuinely full. (That's rare). Overall, we'll surely visit again, but are likely to go with more of an expert to tell us what to order.... I don't doubt we took the safe road with grilled chicken and rotisserie chicken!"}
{"text":"I loved my experience here! I had the #1 with the 1/4 chicken, rice and beans with the tostones. The food was delicious! The service was great, our glasses were always filled. Although we were assigned a waitress, the whole waiting staff comtinuously checked on us to make sure our experience was delightful! I will be visiting again!"}
{"text":"I was hesitant to come here after reading the awful reviews, but ended up being pleasantly surprised. Mainly, the food was solid - I had the chicken soup which was flavorful and quite good w yucca, chicken and a half corn on the cob. Accompanying rice, avocado and plantains were excellent . Companions had snapper (warning! Whole fish served fried!) which was a bit salty but still good. Sampler platter was heavy on meat - could've skipped this one.   The service was shaky, mainly because our young server was clearly not fluent in English and not experienced managing multiple tables in a busy restaurant. He was pleasant however, as was the host and any billing errors were sidestepped because a different person processed our check. I'd recommend anyone on the fence to at least give this place a shot."}
{"text":"Pio Pio is perfect for an escape from the norm. If you want bold Latin flavors that transport you to a different place, you want Pio Pio!  Two friends and I came her as a girl's night. It was a Thursday, and empty for the most part, but the food was great. The service was attentive and friendly, with enthusiastic recommendations. I tried the rotisserie chicken, beans, rice and tostones. Everything was well seasoned and perfectly cooked. The game changer is the green hot sauce. If you can handle heat, just pour it into your rice and prepare for greatness. Another friend enjoyed the same dish I had, with plantains. She loved it. And my other friend tried the skirt steak. I have to try it next time! It looked awesome.   Pio Pio is great for a quiet dinner or delicious take out! I'll definitely keep coming back!"}
{"text":"The best chicken and Jalea we have had!  The spicy green sauce is to die for! The Tostones are huge and fried to perfection! The Queen City is fortunate to have so many different options! We loved it here! Pio Pio come to Raleigh!"}
{"text":"The traditional Peruvian plate called \"arroz chaufa \" Was a tomatal rip off. Regular 11 dollars I paid extra 15 total to add meat and shrimp thinking it was going to be good. Totally disappointing when I got my plate. Just some regular rice with few pcs of meat chicken and shrimp. Didn't have any of the other stuff regular chaufa plate has totally lacking the vegetables egg sausage seasoning and rest. I  would be offended if i was Peruvian."}
{"text":"This place is Amazing. The food is great. The rotisserie chicken was as near perfect as possible and all the side dishes were outstanding. This is a Peruvian restaurant but the menu does well explaining what all the dishes are in case you are not what to order. The waiter was very friendly and the price was not bad at all.  For under $50, it would be easy to feed a hungry family of 4. So if you are in the mood to try something different, this place will not let you down."}
{"text":"I had high expectations but I was let down . The chicken was dry and could have used a bit more flavor. Price wasn't bad though."}
{"text":"I love the plantains here. The chicken is flavorful but sometimes just a little dry. I really like the beans and rice as a side as well. Great value and really good food overall."}
{"text":"We have visited there quite often since they opened and really enjoyed the food, especially the chicken and beef dishes and the plantains and yucca.  We have carried many friends there who also enjoyed the food and the atmosphere.  Today we went there for dinner to discover a sign out front indicating new ownership. Inside once we asked about it we were told that this location and the East Blvd location are now under the same Ownership, and that prior owners had gotten into trouble with kitchen inspections.  They indicated we would love the food that it was tremendously better.  Unfortunately, that was not to be the case.  I had pork chops and they came to me and were end cuts, taste old, and were about 1/4 inch thick.  I also had beans and yucca.  To say the food was salty is an understatement, it was like taking the top off the salt shaker and pouring it into your mouth,  I wish I were exaggerating.  Oh yes did I mention their prices were about 40 % higher also?  What a waste of $40."}
{"text":"Excellent food and service! We brought our entire family for a late lunch today. Even our children loved their food. Everything was fresh and delicious. We love the chicken and steak, but our favorite thing had to be the salad. It was fresh and flavorful. We will most definitely come back again!"}
{"text":"Allow me to start by saying... The food by itself is AMAZING!!   Unfortunately, this Pio Pio location dropped the ball on service. My party of 4 was seated immediately and out waiter introduced himself as soon as we were seated and took our drink orders. Seems like good service so far, right? Yeah, that's what we thought but once we received our drinks... We didn't see our waiter again until we were halfway through our meal (another waiter brought our food to the table).   As a general observation, this location would do alright if they increased their staff... There were 2 waitresses serving approximately 15-18 tables (not sure how many cooks were working the kitchen)... this included taking call-in orders and cleaning the tables when parties left. For a Saturday evening, that's not good staffing for a place with such great food (of course the place is going to be packed).   If I'm in the area, then I will not count this place out but I will probably go with the Dilworth location over this one, given a choice."}
