{"text":"Levack Block is obnoxious. One of its generation of places that thinks it can avoid quality and responsible management because of its flash decor and location on Ossington. The food is simply atrocious - the one time I ate there I was shocked by how bad it was. A few days later I saw the owner buying salad greens at the nearby Price Chopper (now Freshco) - a supermarket with astoundingly bad produce and not what you expect to be eating when paying for a restaurant meal!
The suburbanites who swarm the place on weekends treat the downtown neighbourhood as their private playground (not to mention bathroom), making life miserable for people who live there. The owners seem cater to this crowd and not care about the effect their business has on its area. Odds are Levack will survive a little longer while Ossington is still cool to those who without discerning taste. Advice to anyone looking for a nice night out: look elsewhere. Leave Levack to its parasitic ways. Once things cool down on Ossington this place will go and it won't be a moment too soon."}
{"text":"It's kinda a bar but it has a big dancefloor area at the back and hosts a ton of DJs on a regular basis.

Ossington is the new West Queen West. Levack Block has a corner spot so it gets the most street traffic, although Ossington is kinda a destination spot altogether.

This is a 100% low-profile, neighborhood populated, sometimes sweaty dance party place. It's what the Madison is to small town UofT students to the urbanite West ender."}
{"text":"After being scorched in the Talk forums for living and breathing within my one mile radius close to the financial district and king west, I ventured out off the beaten path. This time my friends suggested Levack Block after we had gone to Pravda and Maro which both had huge long lines which we were not prepared to stand behind in the cold dead of winter.

So we managed to find parking on the side of Ossington street, dumped our coats in the trunk and made a bee line for the nearest place that was blasting loud music which boomed out of the establishment in the remote, almost residential, neighbourhood.

As we walked in, they announced cover was $5.  Although I don't like paying cover, heck we should be paid to be encouraged to spend large amounts at the tab, it was modest compared to the usual places.

The place had two sections. One in the front playing a mix of reggae, rock, hip hop, and alternative rock.  The back of the house played top 40s hit and some r&b hip hop.  So depending on your taste, you could venture across the two different areas. There were bars set-up in both. The back room has a large dance floor and its own bar.  I found the back room more spacious but the air was very humid and stuffy.  The front was less rammed with fresh air coming from the outside as people step in and out of the place. The crowd was young-ish 21-35. Everyone there came with a large group and appeared to be having a great time.

We went on a Sat night and it seemed to be the most happening place on that block.  I had a great time and found the crowd friendly but not overbearing. My friends also had an equally good time.  They said it was a change from the usual hang-outs and were happier with the crowd that didn't have big \"attitude\". 

It didn't appear to me as though they used a tracktor beam to yank every kid from Thornhill to this quintessential bridge-and-tunnel bar (quoted directly from Daniel B.), but what the heck do I know about hang outs or Thornhill for that matter."}
{"text":"Levack Block is a staple on the Ossington Strip, and really the only place I visit regularly in that neighborhood. 

It definitely is an alternative from \"club-scene\" clubs and hipster clubs. It comes somewhere in-between. 

We have had our \"team\" Christmas party here the last three years (on off nights) and I have had a birthday party here years ago. Otherwise I visited on normal weekend evenings.

The staff are really friendly, not the usual hipster-make-inappropriate-for tipping-awkward-change-give-you-drinks-with-attitude bartenders. These people are legit, nice, normal. They really help.

The layout is a little awkward. A beautiful brick walled pub space in the front, with vertical multi-coloured striped walls in front, and a dim-lit-black-light-rough-neck-dance-hall space in the back for dance parties. The dj usually plays a good range of old-school, electro, current dance hits, mashups, hip hop etc. Ladies washroom in the basement, mens upstairs

Coat Check is SUPER unsecure.. a standard rack by bar #2. Keep those Canada Goose in hand. 

Drink prices a little steep for the environment at about $8.00 a pop. Usually rammed on weekends and uber quiet weeknights. 

If you vist, don't miss the bakery http://www.yelp.ca/biz/venezia-bakery-toronto#hrid:yhNwOtZTM_RyS7JDfWj7jA/src:self and Rua Vang Golden Turtle http://www.yelp.ca/biz/rua-vang-golden-turtle-toronto#hrid:eAoE4T1lX3gApoKHH0C4AQ both in the immediate vicinity."}
{"text":"So we happened across this place on our way down to Queen W on a Friday evening, and decided to stop in for a drink because it seemed quiet enough (probably just because it was only 7pm).  They had Guinness on tap which is always worth a couple brownie points.

I just have to say that although their food menu is tiny - like 6 items total - it is tasty!  We ordered the Mediterranean platter, so good.  It came with a ton of pita and hummus, a pile of couscous, some dolmada, kalamatas, artichoke and feta.  Delish.  Also got a half order of the perogies which was more than enough for two people to share.

I'm thinking it may get a bit sweaty in there later on a Friday or Saturday night, but otherwise it's a pretty pleasant, airy place and they play fun tunes as well.  I hadn't heard Jesus Built My Hotrod since maybe 1994?"}
{"text":"you are entering the set of a canadian version of friends but isn't a comedy. this is a reality show about young professionals dealing with life in the big city. with all of it's complicated condo living and middle management troubles. keeping the beat like a drummer on a slave ship is the dj playing generic but unrecognizable pop/dance that skirts around the idea of being current. lame."}
{"text":"In accord with the other reviews on this page, it was very very busy (you had to grind anyone you passed if you wanted to move). Also had to wait in line for like.... 35-40 minutes? (We got there @11pm)

 The drinks were a bit pricier than I would have liked (Cheapest beer I could get was a Labatt 50 but it was still $6).

The layout is first a bar then a dance floor further back. Lots of cougars in the bar area, slightly older crowd generally. On the dance floor, it was awkward to dance- when people left, I'd get room to break down some moves, then immediately get bumped into as more people come in- again- hella busy in this place.

Overall it was decent music, ok crowd, bustling club for sure... but I wouldn't recommend this place to a friend."}
{"text":"This place is pretty cool. The music is good (old skool, top 40) and the crowd is decent, dress code is very casual. It gets extremely packed. So if you dont like skin to skin contact, dont go."}
{"text":"This is a place i don't quite understand. I mean it's good, but I don't get why it's all the rave with the kids. Yep offers these descriptions above and the 2 stars \"meh, I've experienced better\" describes this place perfectly. I've both eaten there, and gone to small gatherings at the front as well as partied at the dance floor at the back, and I still don't get it. 

Staff is nice, and the atmosphere is good, but it's nothing I'd tell friends about."}
{"text":"It's okay, but I'm not sure what the hype (if any) is about.

We started off having dinner here and then the crowd roared in and made the place inaudible - we had to leave after this point.

I think it's a bit too small to be both. If you come for dinner - do it early."}
{"text":"I felt so compelled to write this review because it is SO HARD to find a place in Toronto where you can go and just dance. No pretense, good bar service and if you're 30( like I am)-- some good retro hip hop in the back.

I will return ready to dance the night away"}
{"text":"This was the \"interesting\" stop for a boys night out. Located on Toronto's hipster-esque Ossington strip, the idea of the spot was perfect for a low-key, easy going, casual night out with the lads. 

While the line up was long, I found the door staff to be much more approachable than the Entertainment district D-bags that work security. Conversational and dare I say approach-ably jovial, this put a positive taste in my mouth while I waited sweet sweet mind-numbing, stress-relieving booze. 

Once inside the layout was fairly simple, lower music and bar in front (more for chilling and boozing), loud and proud tuna can...err dance floor out back. I'm not sure what I liked more about the back room having my leg humped by a 19 year old girl OR the single strobe light going to the beat of its own drum. 

Ironically enough, what I liked most about this place (the run down old house) was also what kinda bummed me out after awhile. I consistently had the feeling of being claustrophobic...however, that may have been due to the people. I \"think\" there was a bar in back, but who knows, I couldn't see the walls let alone a bar 

I'd say get there early, but be prepared to be squished if you plan on getting your dance on. The music was good, pulling together an eclectic mix of dancy classics.

The front room, while easier to stand and actually have \"personal space\" was difficult to grab drinks from, so maybe have a few before arriving. 

All this said, for a casual night on the town with a low key group, this is a decent spot. I got in wearing a baseball cap, so it cant be that bad!"}
{"text":"I had no choice but to go to Levack Block last night. I went to a house party (do people say condo party?) for a childhood best friend who is moving to BC next week; it wasn't my party so I certainly wasn't going to disagree with the choice of bar when we decided to take the party to the streets. Plus I had never been to the place, and isn't Ossington supposed to be a hip area?

HUGELY disappointed. Someone below mentioned a \"sea of people\" and this is pretty accurate. MORE correct, however, would be to say the place was rammed to the tits. You really couldn't move around this place without elbowing your way through the drunken masses. And it was hot, sticky and gross. You know when you see packed club scenes in music videos and it looks kinda sexy? Let me tell you, in real life, not so sexy.

Really annoying was that someone decided the coat check should be at the very BACK of the place. So in order to check your coat and then retrieve it at the end of the night, you had to fight your way through the throngs to do so. It was a tough mission, and for a while I wasn't sure I was going to make it.

Music wasn't my thing either. I don't mind a couple throw backs from my youth for a little camp factor (i.e., DeeLite, Groove is in the Heart) but the DJ has to know when to draw the line (i.e., some Will Smith track).

And the drink prices just made me angry. $6.75 for a bottle of Corona? Really? Was I so drunk I imagined that? And no, I didn't get drunk off of 6.75 Coronas...I pre-drank enough at the condo party to keep me going for most of the night :)"}
{"text":"$10 cover for....sweaty heat?  Beats I don't know how to dance to? Drinks served in plastic cups?  It was all really strange.  I like the location, but there wasn't much else really grabbing me here.  Way overpriced."}
{"text":"Great venue, great tunes, great crowd, affordable drinks, no cover. What more could you ask for? This is the place that made Ossington what it is today."}
{"text":"I must not be cool anymore. I had no idea Levack Block existed. Judging by the sea of people in here, everyone else did though. It's definitely an it spot for a Saturday night.

I don't like crowds. Pushing through to get where my friends are at, shoving my way to reach the bar, having people walk through the group of us is not how I like to spend my weekends. But in here, I didn't mind. This was a no attitude crowd. People smiled at me as I shoved my way to get to my destinations throughout the venue. Normally I get annoyed stares as I box out. Plus I'm a shorty. I get trampled on - but not last night. (It's about effing time!)

Older crowd too. Maybe this is where us in our early 30s have decided to hang out on a Saturday. (See! Over 30 year olds still go out.)

Drinks are affordable. Bought a few rounds, we all left extremely (drunk) happy and I still had cash left to burn. I didn't think this was still possible to do. Leaving drunk with money leftover?! It must be years ago since I last did this.

Pretty good dj, and despite the crowd, you'll be able to find a spot to dance. It's dark, but it may be for the better. Not allot of eye candy even with beer goggles on.  But it didn't matter, we were all here for the same reason - just to have a good time! Meat market atmosphere didn't exist in the air in here. (Thank goodness! Imagine that, meat market bar filled with ugly people?!? Not fun! Fine, I'm being slightly mean - they weren't allllll ugly... some were okaaaay...)"}
{"text":"Hey 905... All good that you like coming into the city to party... but you all need to smile more, and be nicer to those of us who have not arrived in groups of 8, or 12... or 16....

The 905 guys are so funny to watch....  It's as though they need to clearly define female targets and male rivals so they have something to talk about during that 40 minute car-ride home.... Hahahah....

Good times at Levack Block."}
{"text":"I really do love going out on the Ossington strip, yes I love to party and the entertainment district has occasionally pulled through for me but Ossington (and also College St) have never failed me!

So my most recent adventure here was for a friends birthday (quite a while ago but I have been too busy to write a review). When we first arrived here, the place was empty. I had just had numerous shots at Reposado  so I was buzzing. There was only one thing to do, and that was to dance despite the empty back room. Seriously though within 20 minutes the place was filling up nicely and an hour later it was jumping. 

Music was a good mix and before I knew it I was in my own dancing/singing whirlpool!"}
{"text":"This place is legit.  Been twice, had an amazing time both times!  and I am very picky.  Friendly staff, and the DJ's are sick in both rooms...could not believe some of the songs I was hearing.  Other then it being sometimes very crowded, I got no complaints..highly recommend to anyone who likes good house, r and b, hip hop."}
{"text":"Part of the growing scene on Ossington, Levack Block has become a popular hangout for locals and late 20s/early 30s people from around the city.  Way back in the day, and I mean WAY back, the location used to be a bank.  If you look above the bar, you can see the iron bars that used to separate the bank tellers from the common folk.  This little tid bit of information made my ears perk up when I first heard it; it's hard not to be intrigued.
They have a good selection of beers, including one or two you recognize, and perhaps 7 or 8 the average beer drinker won't recognize.  Last time I was there, I had a glass of pumpkin ale.  Pumpkin Ale gets a 3.

The bar itself has plenty of tables, but also a large back area that turns into a giant dance party if you're there on the right night.  However, I find the dance party isn't always a sure fire thing on Friday or Saturday.  I've been there on both a Friday and a Saturday with no Dance Party.  Just something to keep in mind."}
{"text":"This is probably one of those \"you can have fun anywhere if you are with friends\" places. I don't have any ill will towards the place but I can't bring myself to praise it either. Just not that memorable. I've been there once for brunch and once on a Saturday night.

Brunch was fine. It was late in the afternoon so it was quiet so service was quick and the waitress had a nice attitude (no, I'm not being sarcastic, she was quite nice). A decent standby if you are in the neighborhood looking for brunch and want to know what is out there.

The Saturday night was ok. It was fairly crowded and the bar was pretty typical weekend Ossington st. Not bad. A lot of people standing around. Not a ton of people smiling but not dripping with attitude like some places further east.

The music oscillated wildly between pretty great and decidedly meh. I had the \"I feel like I can DJ better than this at home\" conversation with someone in the bathroom. For every \"Award Tour\", \"Wanna Be Starting Something\" or \"Got Your Money\" there was an ill advised descent into Ace of Base or Marley \"Three Little Birds.\" 

The good: the space is pretty big (especially in back) so it would probably be good for large groups. The coat check people were also really helpful in clearing up a mix-up with our jackets.

In sum: I would not be averse to going back, but it as you can probably tell, I don't have any deep burning desire to do so. No ill will but no gushing praise. I'm guessing that two stars is the appropriate grade for that."}
{"text":"I went to Levack Block for a friend's birthday. It's a neat little corner on the Ossington strip. Note that the menu is 5 entrees long and out of these 5, only one includes meat. I get it, the place is meant to be a bar and I probably should have researched that before going out on an empty stomach; it pretty much killed my night. 

I went in at 8pm, which was too early; decided to go out to grab grub at 8:30 ish but Toronto started downpouring on us for 2 hours straight. And I was dressed in white. Never a good idea for a girl. At around 10:30, on a Saturday night, a $10 cover was implemented at the door. Mind you, I would never pay cover to enter this place but surprisingly it got quite full. The bar was so packed but I managed a drink... maybe 2, at that point. And it may have been because of the Beer Fest on the same day, but there were a lot of drunken men - 2 of who sleazed on me. 

I left around 11pm, before I could witness the dancefloor and shake it to some music. My friend left me a message saying that I totally missed out. I'll believe that... but for now, Levack Block gets a 2 star."}
{"text":"I don't get this place - why do so many people love it?

I went there last Friday night and the DJ was shit (to the point that people were just standing, not dancing). I dunno, maybe white people can dance to this.

And the beer here is $7.50 per pint which is a stupid. The only redeeming point is there's attractive women here - although some look like they got in with fake id."}
{"text":"I brought one group of friends here to meet another group of friends at Levack Block who recommended the place. We first had to wait in line -- not unusual. But it was irritating to see people doing who knows what to skip the line to get in. Again, not exactly uncommon, but still enough to lessen my experience. So we keep waiting, nobody is leaving, and after some arbitrary amount of time they decide to let us in anyway.

The front is a really hot and uncomfortable bar area. It's really dark and doesn't have the best music. Head straight to the back where the action is. The bar has shorter lines, there is a packed dance floor (although TOO packed at many points), and a massive fan spinning on the ceiling to keep the room cool. The music was pretty decent, but nothing mind blowing. 

Drinks were pretty standard prices ($6-7) and the cover was $5. Casual dress code.

In the end we had a really good time. The girls were dancing on the raised borders around the room, and the music kept us moving. You will probably have a good time if you decide to come here."}
{"text":"Is this place for real? I've gone to this place a number of times since it opened, and last night was my first time there in a couple of years.

The DJ in the back room was awful. Ja Rule? Will Smith? Are you kidding me? He played the most obvious music Top 40 music you could imagine. To make it worse, the Top 40 that he played wasn't even good Top 40, and the order in which he played his tracks had no sense whatsoever. Although I can be particular about music, even if its not my style, I can still have a good time if the DJ puts a little effort and thought into his set. However, a play list of 103.5 and 99.9 played on from 10 years ago played on random wouldn't have been much different than this.

Also, the bathrooms: The guy's bathroom has had plywood walls with no paint on it for years. I used to think it was under renovation, but after having not gone for a couple of years, only to return and see that the bathroom still had those same temporary walls up makes me think how greedy the owners are. This place is packed every Friday and Saturday night, they charge $10 to get in, and the drinks aren't cheap. The least you could do is provide your customers with an adequate bathroom. 

Why is it so dark in there? It's clear that this is a pick-up bar judging by the behaviour of most of its patrons, so why is it too dark to even see anyone in the back room? 

I only went to this place because it was my friend's birthday, but there is a reason why I stayed away from this place for so long. If you are looking for any meaning, culture, or any sort of substance in your night out whatsoever, stay away from this place. Levack Block is a bland watering hole, devoid of any culture, served in an unkempt package in a feeble attempt to make it \"hipster\" or cool. There is very little difference between this place and Richmond Street West clubs of yesteryear. Being on Ossington doesn't make you cool."}
{"text":"\"It's on Ossington, It must be cool.\"

No. 

Nothing screams \"I have my daddy's credit card, so I can buy drinks\"  like one of the rat-faced, nose-jobed suburbanites that crowd around the tables in the front room of this space. 

A quick wander into the back room is like visiting a high school dance party complete with outdated music, poor hairstyles and overdone makeup.  

It's almost as if they used a tractor-beam to yank every kid from Thornhill to this quintessential bridge-and-tunnel bar.      

Having Brooklyn Lager on tap was the saving grace for this establishment, although this no longer seems to be the case.  It's a shame to watch a bar open with such potential and then watch it turn into a cliched post-high school hangout.

Shark City South."}
{"text":"Levack is a mystery to me. All my slightly older friends kept wanting to go here about 2 years ago. Everytime i went, there was a lineup and the inside was packed to the titties. But it seems convenient for birthdays in the 30+ age group, trying to relive a little bit of youth funk in a 'too packed to be just a bar but not really a club either' atmosphere.  

The good part though is you get into an older and more mature crowd so you avoid all the crap that is now being associated with Queen/Ossington area. The music is ok. The front room looks fine, then the back room looks almost dungeonous. But you're probably too drunk to care.
I guess if you're with a good group of friends, this place isn't too bad, but i would never willingly want to go here."}
{"text":"Ever since I moved 2 years ago, I've been completely and utterly out of touch with downtown Toronto; the renovated restaurant that is now 5 stars and not 3, the new trendy lounge to be seen at, or the once less-than-desirable neighbourhood to be around that is now hoppin'. However, good service and good food is a must for me wherever I happen to end up. Sadly, that was not the case at Levack Block.

Meeting college girlfriends for a night of drinks, food, and catch-up tales, I was less than impressed with their classic burger and even more so when our bartender/hostess/server asked us to move tables so a larger party could take over. Yes people, there was only one person manning the entire floor the whole night; thus, not only were we asked to move, the service alone was just awful. Empty water glasses, lukewarm food - even the side salad was somehow warm and most likely wilting before my eyes, and my very bland vodka-tonic was beyond disappointing. 

It looks like I still haven't found the hip \"place to be\" in Toronto but at least, at the very least, you know where you won't be finding me again."}
{"text":"I moved to Toronto from Vegas for a couple months. This place was my favourite spot. Its completely different from my regular scene (the big fist pumping clubs in vegas). I enjoyed a lot because of the music. Every single time I went, they always played great old school hip hop music. You don't find that many places like that in Toronto. This place has a simple bar in the front, but got a dive bar in the back. Its kinda grungy, but its sooo much fun and chill. If you wanna break from your pretentious king street scene, take a time out at this place!!!"}
{"text":"Came out with some friends on a Saturday night. It's an interesting place. In the front is a bar where they're playing music if you just want to hang out and drink and chat with your friends. The back however is a full-on club. There's a second bar (cash only), a DJ, and the whole space is wide open to dance and for guys to push through when trying to go to the bathroom. Also, the coat check is in the farthest corner possible so you have to walk past every single person in the bar to ditch your jacket.

The crowd was pretty good the night I was there. A good mix of people, some interesting characters, a couple of douche bags, but the general vibe was that everyone was there to have a good time.
