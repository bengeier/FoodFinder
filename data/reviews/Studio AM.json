{"text":"Best brunch in the 'burgh. This place has it going on! Service was excellent, everyone is super friendly, and the food was relish! This is our new brunch spot for sure. The atmosphere is so cool and the staff make you feel at home. 
Hubby and I went with our two little guys for Father's Day brunch and really enjoyed ourselves. Very kid friendly. Kids loved the pancakes and French toast. The hubs and I wanted to lick the bowl of the sausage gravy and the grits. Go now!!"}
{"text":"Studio AM is one of those rare and special places that makes you feel at home as soon as you walk in. The owner, Baron Batch, is an amazing artist and you are surrounded by his work the whole time you're there! The chef, Steve, is also an artist. The food he prepares is phenomenal! I've been there for Thai Thursday and Sunday brunch. Both were phenomenal. If it's available be sure to try the red curry!"}
{"text":"This place is incredible! Great artistic ambience. The sunday brunch is exquisite. Their potato scallions were incredible. The 3 course meal started with coconut pancakes and pinapple cream, and strawberry french toast (delicious!!!). Second course we had shrimp and grits and eggs. For the third course they served sauteed chicken cutlet with sage cream sauce. Everything was superb. Great staff as well, the owner personally introduced himself to us. Highly recommend this place, this will become a regular for us!"}
{"text":"Studio A.M. is the type of place you see on travel shows on TV and think \"when I go to that city I'm gonna visit there\".  It's the most unique Sunday eating/networking experience you will ever have.  There's nothing like it.

Started by ex Steeler player Baron Batch (Now going by simply, The Artist) Studio A.M. is a work of art by a free mind, for free minds.  I'm going to do my best to give you an idea of how your experience will be here off of how mine was but half the beauty of this place is in the interpretation, the other half is the Art/Food.

From 9pm-3pm on Sunday's is typically the only time you can access this place but make sure you clear the time to go.  Studio A.M. is an explosion of the senses, a living breathing display of art created by The Artist.  While you gaze and wonder they will have a dj spinning unheard upbeat oddities while smells of raspberry French toast and locally grown ingredients creep their way from the kitchen to your subconscious.  The visuals and sound and smells will over take you and before you know it you'll be sipping mint mango green tea laughing and interacting with people and making memories.  The Artist is always there greeting everyone and being a hell of a host and you never feel a disconnect from him.  He's a man who loves art like he does life, and that creates a welcoming aura throughout the entire establishment.  

Studio A.M. And The Artist are ever evolving, creating a fresh experience for each new visitor and leaving feeling of positivity coursing through your body after you leave.  If the world had more Studio A.M., the world would be a lot happier."}
{"text":"A very cool space to have brunch!  There is nothing else like it in Pittsburgh. Truly one of a kind experience!  The atmosphere is beautiful as all of the walls are covered with Baron Batch's (Pittsburgh Steelers) art.  There are huge murals and paintings for sale both on the walls and in the art cave downstairs.   Literally everything that could be painted has been painted, even the tables, piano and bathtub!  It is very eclectic and you can't stop looking at the art everywhere.  There is art work for sale from stickers, t-shirts and \"pocket art\" to larger paintings both framed and unframed.  Something for any level art collector who wants something very \"Pittsburgh\"! The food at the brunch was absolutely delicious!  There is a buffet that includes; sausage, bacon, cheesy potatoes, chicken, vegetables and delicious cut up fruit salad.  But you had better save room because Chef Steve Morehouse brings out three more full courses!! First course includes the most delicious banana & chocolate pancakes (super thin!) and French toast with an amazing strawberry and vanilla sauce that is to die for.  Second course was the cutest mini biscuits and gravy and third course varies but today it was crab fried rice!  It is crazy that all of this food was only $25!  The art on the walls changes every few weeks and sells out quickly so get it while you can! I love coming back all the time and bringing guests to see the beautiful art!"}
{"text":"Went to this studio for a photo shoot. Such a nice place to get creative. Got to go downstairs for the photos and hangout with friends upstairs. Baron's art is everywhere. Full of vibrant colors and sayings. It's pretty inspirational stuff. They do yoga sometimes in the space as well. The only thing about this place that I don't like is the unique spiral staircase that they have. It isn't disability friendly. There isn't an elevator, so I imagine anyone with some motor limitations is restricted to upstairs. 

It does look like you can host events in the space. So if you want a fun creative get together with friends, definitely check it out. 

It's located near the waterfront, so after stopping by Studio AM, you could enjoy other activities in Homestead. There is street parking. But, just know, you will be parking on a really busy street."}
{"text":"We had a late brunch here with a large group of friends. It was wonderful, so much so that I hate to spread the word about this gem. The food was excellent -- I'm craving the roasted red pepper and goat cheese quiche now -- the ambiance delightful and the Studio AM crew
 (Barron Batch, Chef Steve, Tori, etc.) were wonderful. We can't wait to return."}
{"text":"I love this Space. I've been in for Thai Thursday a couple of times and the food is amazing. Thai buffet or individual dishes...some of the best Pad Thai I've ever had. Both times I've been we shared dishes among the table. BYOB so share a bottle or two with your friends.

You'll need to make a reservation by email because it does fill up fast. 

Don't forget to take a walk through to check out the artwork. Reasonably priced and one of a kind. You might even catch Baron there!"}
{"text":"If you think that you know the coolest brunch spot in Pittsburgh and haven't been to Studio Am, you should re-evaluate how cool you are.  Studio Am has it all:  Ambiance, Service and food.  

Ambiance: How awesome is it to be able to sit in an eclectic art gallery to eat brunch.  It is community seating, so you never know who you will meet.  Baron Batch made an appearance and personally thanked us for coming.  Class Act.  Don't forget to explore before you leave.  The bathroom is its own little gallery and the backroom and go down the spiral staircase to the base basement where there are some hidden gems that are truly amazing.  

Service:  We were the first ones there and it wasn't very busy at that time.  We were welcomed as if we were just coming over for breakfast.  Great vibe.  Our server was very attentive and not overbearing.  It is a buffet/service.  half the items are on a buffet and half come out family style.  Our server was great.  

Food:  For $25, we left stuffed.  The buffet had great side items such as potatoes, carrots, a chicken roll, beans, but you still get 3 family style courses which included banana chocolate pancakes, banana and raspberry french toast, Sausage gravy and the cutest little bite sized biscuits and this weeks feature Hearty Beef Stew (with the cute little biscuits).  All items were fresh and a perfect mix of savory and sweet.  Advice:  Don't do what I did and fill up on the buffet, there is so much more food.  

Lastly, don't overlook the strawberry water.."}
{"text":"Wonderful, amazing experience to dine and hang at Studio AM. My husband and I took our two-year old for brunch on Saturday and we arrived to a table literally with our name on it. Delicious buffet and family style entrees, great coffee, sangria, tea, juice. Fun and artsy vibe, which only improved when Baron Batch himself arrived. He spent time with guests and was very friendly and conversational.

We enjoyed walking around the art gallery and purchased a canvas. Baron signed it for us and chatted some more before we left. I cannot recommend this place enough."}
{"text":"When I first came to Studio AM two weeks ago, they weren't on yelp! I was super excited to see they are on it now!

This place is AMAZING. In every single possible way! 

Studio AM is Baron Batch's studio, along with his crew. Baron creates incredible and unique artwork and John Malecki creates beautifully crafted furniture. This is their studio and work place, first and foremost. Every Sunday (or the Sundays they are available to do so), they host brunch! The hours are from 11-3 and it is currently RSVP only. You can check out their site to see how to rsvp, I did so by e-mail.

My boyfriend and I were incredibly excited about this brunch! We rsvped for 11 am and each paid $20 up front, for the brunch. Every single person who worked there was friendly, welcoming and made me feel right at home! The setting is not like a restaurant and is not meant. There are plenty of places to sit, but it is in a casual way, with sofas and some bar style seating. There aren't \"servers\" here, it's the crew of Studio AM, that casually walk around and take any orders that you have. There is also a buffet that consists of fresh fruit and various brunch items. When I went, there was a fruit salad, green beans with mushrooms, scalloped potatoes, smoked bacon and chicken stuffed with tomatoes and goat cheese. Everything was so good! I went up for seconds and had more green beans, bacon, fruit and potatoes. Everything was packed with flavor. They also had coffee, orange juice, cranberry juice and bloody mary mix for your taking, too. It's BYOB, so you can bring your own vodka for the bloody mary mix!

Besides the buffet, you can order off of their menu. My boyfriend and I tried a couple things. We asked John what he recommended and he told us that we HAD to try the French toast. I didn't want to order the same thing as my boyfriend, so I ordered chocolate banana pancakes. OMG! The French toast was literally the best I have ever had! It was so good... the drizzle on top made the dish completely. My pancakes were amazing as well, there was even melted chocolate chips on top! Mhm! Before leaving, I also ordered their breakfast club which was incredible! The garlic aioli just took it to a whole different level of amazing. 

Chef Steve is the one behind all of the magic! He was so friendly, shared a few tips with me on how to improve my French toast abilities AND he even took us to the basement to show us how they smoke their bacon and other meat, after my boyfriend asked him how they do it! How amazing is that?!

Baron was painting on canvas during the entire brunch. He was approachable, super friendly and even let us hang out at his work table to watch him paint. What an awesome experience! Everyone there was so laid back.

I plan on coming back and bringing my friends and family. This was honestly one of the absolute coolest experiences I have ever had. The food was amazing, the art is amazing, the people are amazing.. it's just all around an amazing time and I CANNOT recommend checking out Studio AM RIGHT NOW, any more!"}
{"text":"Beyond awesome.  This is a sexy and chill-ass place. The creator, artist and owner has created a really urban hangout featuring his work and some of the BEST FOOD from Chef Steve.
Can I tell you just GO? Don't even think twice?
I've gone for brunch and Thai Thursday since discovering the awesomeness.  Both menus include a combo of buffet and family style.  The menu changes based on whim and ingredients. Everything was flavorful and comforting for brunch. Thai Thursday was spectacular. The red curry and northern Thai soup (can't spell the name) were the higlighta for me. The spices were on point. So good. 
Its BYOB. and they do provide some tasty beverages like tea and flavored water (all homemade of course.) 
Service is welcoming and super friendly. Baron the owner stopped by and said hello. Chef Steve came out to see how things were. Our server was really really helpful and kind. Super genuine. 
I've been there for brunch and Thai Thursday. Both are off the chain. Some of the best food in Pgh combined with the most unique, best place to.eat it. 
Not to be missed."}
{"text":"THE coolest place I have ever been in Pittsburgh, period. 

Went for Saturday BYOB brunch, which consists of a flavorful three course meal plus a buffet filled with plenty of other great dishes and unlimited coffee, tea, sangria, flavored water, etc. Absolutely impeccable food and a killer bang for your buck. Don't stuff yourself with the buffet too early though! They give you PLENTY of food with each course.

As many would guess, the most unique aspect of this place is the ambience. You're surrounded with jaw-dropping pop art and hand-made furniture during brunch, plus we explored a few other rooms (and the bathroom!) that were jam-packed with pieces as well. I didn't have the chance to meet Baron Batch (who is there quite frequently, so I've heard), but talked extensively with some of the managers there who were incredibly friendly and proud to work there. A must to check-out or have an event at in Pittsburgh. Get going!"}
{"text":"Discovered this gem at the recommendation of a coworker. Brunch begins with a buffet and spans 3 full courses. The food is served in a space full of original artwork with an \"Art Cave\" on the lower level. The food is phenomenal and the staff is friendly. If you enjoy quality food, people, and vibes...visit Studio AM.

Brunch is served only on Sundays from 11am - 3pm. They also open their doors for Thai Thursdays from 7pm - 11pm."}
{"text":"AWESOME UNIQUE PLACE!

I cannot say enough about this - Gallery? Restaurant? Graffiti paradise? All of the above!!

I came here with some friends for a special event in the evening. 

To start, parking is minimal on the main drag so we parked in a small public parking lot right across from the Aldi grocery store nearby. It has 24-hour parking meters which only take quarters so keep that in mind. 

We were treated to a special menu featuring quinoa chili, chicken marsala with pasta, spring mix salad with strawberry balsamic vinaigrette, seasoned diced potatoes, vegetable medley, crab cakes, and bruschetta toast bites.  All the food was absolutely incredible, unique, and full of flavor. I could eat that balsamic dressing off of a shoe! It was delicious.  

After eating, we were invited to check out the space, which has a main level featuring some artwork and displays, and a spiral staircase leading downstairs to a basement area with more awesome pieces and furniture. 

We spoke with the chef/owner for a bit and he was very friendly and passionate about the venue and his food. He quoted us a VERY reasonable price for renting out the venue for a private event, and said he is willing to create custom menus for any style of event. He truly seems like he would be great to work with for a special event because he pours everything into his food and it really shows! He's the real deal.

We were blown away by this place and are already planning to return for their weekend brunch or weekday Thai dinners.  

Initially I thought, this might be suited for a select crowd (mid-20's to early 30's), but I was completely wrong! There was a variety of people in attendance for the event I went to, from 20 year olds to 60+ year olds, and all were craning their neck to check out every inch of the space. It was just awesome to see everyone being open to this art experience!

For a unique, fantastic experience with some great food prepared by a very talented chef, I urge you to check this place out!! It totally fits in with the vibe of the surrounding neighborhood, while being open enough for any crowd of people to enjoy!"}
{"text":"This is likely the most eclectic and artistic location I've ever been for brunch.  Studio AM is part restaurant part contemporary art gallery with refurbished tables and art on the walls ranging from cool elephant paintings to old school Chuck Taylor kicks.  I dig the atmosphere.

I don't think they normally do a Saturday brunch right now since they're just getting started but we had called ahead for a reservation of seven and they had prepared a buffet just for us.  Now, you could order from a limited brunch menu and pay $10 to forgo the buffet, but then you would have missed out. 

The buffet was delish with Ratatouille, cheesy potatoes, fried rice and bacon.  You could then ask the chef to prepare eggs for you to go with the other items.  Additionally, they brought out crazy good chocolate banana pancakes that were like crepes and some excellent french toast.  All this for about $10.  They also had coffee, tea, and flavored water included.

Great staff, great atmosphere and fantastic food."}
{"text":"Loved this place. Cool vibe.. Great food... Good service.  Artist Baron Batch went from table to table.  Very approachable. 
We would definitely go back. Art work on the walls was different but amazing. Studio downstairs is open for viewing. Buffet and items brought to table.  Pre determined menu.  Bathrooms were clean."}
{"text":"The space is beautiful and perfectly eclectic. Studio AM has an amazing vibe of chill and creativity. The art on the walls and surrounding areas just pulls you in to take a closer look, and you are free to walk around and explore. 

The food offerings are nearly as impressive and creative as the art. We were able to have their Sunday brunch during a private event on a Saturday. Every item on the buffet was delicious, which is a difficult feat to master. The perfectly cooked rice blew many of our minds, because rice, which is normally a no brainer to cook can easily be delicious or terrible and this was perfectly cooked and flavored. My favorites were the breakfast quiche with the fluffy, and cheesy eggs followed by cheesy breakfast potatoes, caesar salad, and finally the french toast. I thought the quinoa in the vegetarian chili was a unique item, and look forward to trying this method at home.

All of the staff was very friendly and great to interact with. Definitely make this a place to visit!"}
{"text":"If you're looking for something completely different from your typical Sunday brunch spot...THIS IS IT! The place is brilliantly decorated with Baron Batch's colorful pop art and John Malecki's furniture so my eyes never stopped wandering around while I was eating.

The staff: Baron and John are two amazing guys plus the rest of the servers were just as welcoming and accommodating . Each and every one of them came over to say hello and get my name. I dare you to name another place that does that.

The deal: $20 gets you thru the door and you have free reign to the art studio and includes your all-you-can-eat feast. It's open seating so pick a table, couch, or love seat and enjoy. 

The food: heavily and delicious! Chef Steve offers a blackboard where you can order specials as well as a wholesome buffet. Both are all-you-can-eat! John was actually telling us to order everything. I'm gluten free. There wasn't specific gluten free alternatives but they served omelets and other items that are naturally GF. The bacon....OMG!

p.s. if you're a pastry lover get there early because they go quickly. Thanks to Sweet Little Eats."}
{"text":"The hype is 100% accurate. I went for brunch and everything from the moment we walked in until we left was fantastic. 
Ambiance and decor: bright. awesome. creative. trendy. chill. 

Food: AMAZING. WOW. for $30 dollars you get A LOT of food. First course is buffet style: what appeared to be a simple fruit salad but was the best, ever... strawberries, pineapple, and MINT. mmmmm
Quiche, potatoes, meat, green beans, all pheNOM. The other dishes were served on a large platter to share: pancakes, french toast, biscuits and gravy, steak, shrimp, and rice. My parents cut their steak with a butter knife, if that's any indication of how tender the steak was. (I should note we went on Mother's Day, I think the buffet price may usually be 25? My mom received an amazing canvas print from Baron, I was green with envy). 

Service: exceptional. Our server was funny and had the exact right amount of attentiveness. 

It really is an experience. From start to finish. There was a band playing some great tunes when we walked in. And we checked out the art cave in the basement before we left. 

Totally vibin on this place. In all of my social media posts I referred to it as my new favorite place and I'm serious. I can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"Have been meaning to check this place out for a while, finally went for my husband's birthday today.. $25 seemed a little steep for brunch, but we were not disappointed! Really cool vibe/décor, great friendly service, excellent food! Somewhere fun and different to go in the area, I would highly recommend checking it out!"}
{"text":"Full experience at Studio AM. Great environment, attentive team, and delicious brunch meals. Second time dining here and the creative space and inspired flavors will always have me trying to come back whenever in town."}
