{"text":"The best local taco shop. My family has been going here for almost 20 years. Best local taco shop off water street. The place is very clean and the staff is very friendly. The food is great, especially the carne Asada!"}
{"text":"So glad we followed Yelp reviews and chose this Mexican fast food place when we were passing thru yesterday at lunch time.  We (husband, adult daughter, and I) call ourselves \"taco inspectors\"....love to sample street style tacos whenever we get a chance.  Santa Rosas carne asada and carnitas tacos were excellent.  Wished we could have tried other offerings.  I like the little salsa bar, nice to be able to help ourselves.  Very efficient and friendly staff.  Would return often if only we lived nearby.  Highly recommend."}
{"text":"Outstanding food Always great service when I go there. You are never disappointed it's a great spot."}
{"text":"Wow, I'm from the Bay where we have some good Taquerias. Just came here with a few friends after ATVing and this place hit the spot! Great flavor and great prices as well!"}
{"text":"Great food! I asked if they could make me something that wasn't on the menu. And despite the confusion (my bad ;), they made it anyway & it was delicious! Jose Jr, Ruben & Jose H, great job!"}
{"text":"So far best Mexican hole in the wall since I moved to henderson. Very friendly and fast service. Food was great. My girls had the enchiladas, my husband had the Carne Asada nachos and I had a torta DE milanesa. All very good, taste homemade. We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Best Mexican food in Henderson and even Las Vegas. Great staff as well. I've been coming here for years and their quality has remained consistent the entire time. They always use fresh ingredients and have a drive thru which is a plus. They have a small salsa bar in the inside with a few to choose from."}
{"text":"I love this place always has wonderful food,, and they always make it just right,, every time"}
{"text":"First time here, had the 5 rolled beef taquitos. DELICIOUS!! Definitely a hole in the wall, space is small, but the food is authentic. Would have given 5 stars but place could use a remodel. Otherwise food and the salsa was great! Staff was friendly and service was quick. Definitely will be coming back and would recommend to others."}
{"text":"For the food I ate I have to disagree with the previous reviewer about Santa Rosa Taco Shop being better than Roberto's.  I ordered a large salsa, a beef tostada, and a tamale.  The salsa was rather bland.  I would not pay $3 for a large again.  If I am inclined to make salsa I think mine is better.  The beef tostada was good and inexpensive but if there was a Roberto's around I would rather go there.  The beef used in the tostada is better at Roberto's.  Finally, the tamale was fine but the favor of the filling was lost.  Maybe due to the red sauce.  My meal was $8 and though not outrageous I think I would have a better and cheaper meal from Roberto's."}
{"text":"This hidden gem is worth finding.  The ambiance does not tell you anything about the food.  It is very simple, no frills and not much to look at.  But the food...  that is a different story.  The menu is similar to other taco shops,  but the taste is authentic and the best part is that the food is relatively cheap.  I am not an adventurous eater, and only had the quesadilla and rolled tacos; both outstanding options.  Those items and a large drink cost a fraction of Roberto's or other Mexican venue's.  If you're in the area and don't judge a book by the cover, say hola to Santa Rosa Taco Shop.  You won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"This is a lucky find.
Great food and good price.
Not close to our home but we will be back."}
{"text":"If you like Roberto's, this is way better!  Best  Asada, Pastor and Carnitas.  My favorite Mexican fast food place, anywhere!  I ate more at the location on Lake Mead Pkwy on the way to the lake, when I lived at Lake LV.  Both locations are equally great."}
{"text":"Family owned, great clean mexican food that's as close to homemade as it gets. Super tiny, old building. Nothing fancy, just great food, great service. 

Just found out they do breakfast too. 

Get the Chile relleno. Actually, get 3."}
{"text":"I had high hopes for this place... My brother really loved the burritos and I read awesome reviews on Yelp. Maybe I'm spoiled being from Chicago with amazing dive joints to upscale Mexican restaurants but the food was not even near \"okay.\" I wouldn't even give it a solid \"meh,\" since the food was just not good. The guacamole had a strange lime green hue and resembled liquid that came out of the bag. The enchilada red sauce tasted so bland and really like nothing. The beef was gray and tasted like nothing also. The \"carne asada\" was chewy and weird. Even the cheese was off putting. I feel bad writing this because I wanted to like it so badly, since the people were really nice and it looked like a cool spot. Unfortunately, that wasn't the case..."}
{"text":"My two boys had the kids cheese quesadilla and loved them. My husband and I shared the carne asada nachos which were amazing and worth coming back for. We all shared rolled chicken tacos which we felt were a bit bland, but adding salsa from the salsa bar quickly livened them up. Service was friendly and small tables were clean. All my boys loved the horchata.  We'll be back next time we are in town."}
{"text":"This small restaurant has the best service and food in the area! The Tostada taco salad is delicious with grilled chicken or shredded beef. The Carnitas combination plate is also an excellent choice. You can drive-thru or stop inside to get your order. I normally go inside since you can choose from a variety of salsas at their salsa bar.
I plan on trying out many of the other combination plates and burritos since everything on the menu looks great!"}
{"text":"After reading some of the good reviews on here I decided to try this place out for myself. So after going out of my way to find this place and driving all the way to the other side of town I found out that it's in a very sketchy area (right across the Henderson detention center). After walking in you can barely breathe due to the horrible smell of sewer coming from the back. Secondly you receive what would be the worst possible customer service ever, and to top it off they serve you food that is cold to the touch. I definitely would advise to stay far away from this place, and I certainly will not be going back!"}
{"text":"Disclaimer: This review is based solely on their breakfast burritos.

And man are they fabulous!  I typically have them make a beast with eggs, chorizo, bacon, rice, cheese and pico.  It is breakfast nirvana! Next to Los Tacos, I think this place has the best salsa verde in town.  In addition, the staff is super friendly.  Even though the location is out of the way for me, I make the detour whenever possible to enjoy the goodness!"}
{"text":"Love the food here the carnitas are very fresh they got a good selection of salsas as well. Try  the nachos."}
{"text":"After reading so many reviews about the carne asada fries, I had to get them. Upon returning to work from the drive-thru (love that there's a drive-thru!) the wonderfully delicious smell nearly compelled me to mow down small children and old ladies in an effort to reach the lunch room faster. They don't skimp on toppings and the salsas provided only enhance the yummy factor. The price was $7.03, more than I was expecting for an order of fries but the serving size is easily two meals for one healthier than I. 
Happy I found this place!"}
{"text":"Doing some shopping downtown Henderson, Nv and needed a quick Mexican food fix. Santa Rosa Restaurant fit the bill. Quick and courteous service. For a quick fix this is the place to try."}
{"text":"This place is a small \"hole in the wall\" but the food is great and the customer service is second to none. Coming from Southern Ca I have found it a little difficult to find good Mexican food but this place is a little hidden gem. This reminds me of the taco shops or taquerias found in Southern CA. 

Nothing fancy but definitely worth a trip."}
{"text":"Can't beat the breakfast burrito in the morning. Cheap, fast, quality Mexican food that I grew up with. Not the \"whitened\"-version of Mexican food like Chipotle or Baja Fresh."}
{"text":"I've only gone through the drive-thru, but this food is delicious. A lot of locals really like Fausto's, but I thought this food was much better. Where Fausto's can be greasy or bland, this place has really fresh-tasting food with great flavor. I highly recommend this restaurant if you're hankering for Mexican food."}
{"text":"Seriously the best Mexican food I have found since moving here from San Diego!!  Everything is good, never let down."}
{"text":"I was finally in the area to try this place and would not let the opportunity pass by. 

I got there close to closing and the food was still very good! The service was also great! Always a good sign of good business. I examined the menu for a minute before I decided on ordering the carnitas plate to go. While I was waiting for my order, I picked up a couple different salsas to try. They were both good too! 

The plate came with a good portion of carnitas with lettuce and guacamole next to it, rice and beans, and your choice of flour or corn tortillas (I went with the corn). I dove into the rice and beans first, they were pretty good. Next, I assembled a fat taco and ate it rather fast with the salsa I brought back. Safe to say, this place is legit. 

I seen a lot of things I wanted to try on the menu so I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Amazing chicken enchiladas verde! Beans and rice are really yummy! Friendly staff. Our new favorite neighborhood Mexican joint."}
{"text":"This is a hole-in-the-wall Mexican joint with very good food. The service is also fast and the staff is friendly. The ground beef nachos are the bomb."}
{"text":"I love there tacos
Great service and very fast
I would recommend
Like the hours they're open too"}
{"text":"This place is as good as it gets for a taco shop. My wife and I are connoisseurs of southern California taco shops. But we never eat at them when we go to vegas. But we got sick of eating at pretentious Vegas restaurants with prices that don't reflect the quality of the experience. So this time around we ate at local dives and hole-in-the-walls. But to call something a \"dive\" or a \"hole-in-the-wall\" does not accurately reflect the efforts made by the owners and staff to create a culture of excellence. So sincere thanks to the employees of these independent restaurants. Not only was the food grade at this place, but the servers were friendly and hospitable. The prices were reasonable. And the chili rellenos are among the best I've had a taco shop, and the green chili pork burrito was as good as anything I could get in the Southwest."}
{"text":"Good customer service, the drive thru employee was very nice, and the food was delicious. I would definitely go back. I really recommend this place."}
{"text":"Ate there often as it was close to work until I got food poisoning.  Had my usual chicken nachos and was sick for three days.  Still feel nauseous when I drive by."}
{"text":"So I've been here twice now. I find their food to be like home cooked Mexican food.....with love. I saw someone complain about smell, WHAT? Haven't noticed any unpleasant smells at all. The menu selection is fantastic and so are the prices, just what they should be. Hope they don't raise them now that I've said this lol. Mexican food shouldn't be expensive to be good and this place proves that. Great selection at the salsa bar too. Has definitely become my go to for Mexican food. Thanks to all the Yelpers out there, this is my primary source to find good places to eat. Of course it's not always right what some say, so those of you that make reviews, try to be honest without being nasty."}
{"text":"Santa Rosa Taco Shop had very good service, and the woman who helped me was very friendly. However, I can't give them a higher rating because the food was only OK. I was happy to see my favorite dish, chile verde, on the menu, but it was so tangy, probably from vinegar, that I didn't finish it all. The Spanish rice was pretty bland, and I've had better. The pineapple water that the cashier recommended was refreshing and not overly sweet, which is the way I like it. I'm afraid I won't be back and will continue my search for good Mexican food in the area."}
{"text":"Okay! There is competition here for Mexican food but I have been loyal. Stuck by this place for years. But I have noticed a change in the quality and quantity of food here and I'm afraid it's time to file for divorce. I prefer Super Nachos and 5 Rolled tacos. The past 3 times that I've ordered the nachos I've noticed two big things. 1. They changed the chips and 2. The chips taste as if they were rinsed with water and air dried. They are stale chips. Now the quality of the Asada meat?!? I think it was a rump roast placed in a food processor. Luckily I've been blessed with the same cook who does mediocre work. This order tonight had maybe 10 stale chips and the food processor meat and the chips and meat were served cold! Then the rolled tacos. Well let's see. There was no yellow grease paper like there is for the nachos so when you deep fried these things and placed them into the lovely styrofoam container... guess what happens???Yup it melted through. I really hope this restaurant reads this. I would think that would be some sort of health violation right?! Do better guys. The quality has fallen for these items on your menu. I can't speak for anything else. Train your cooks to prepare the food the same. Night time shouldn't be different from a day time cook. In the trash the rolled tacos will go. Waste of money and gas!"}
{"text":"I've been here for breakfast and lunch and this place has never disappointed.
Everything is fresh and the service is great."}
{"text":"Yay! Greasy, flavorful, delicious cheap Mexican food. Hoorah."}
{"text":"From San Diego so we know good taco shops 
This is first rate fresh veggies and brisket beef in the caldo res soup my wife wanted to try the menudo and the lovely owners Caesar and Irene gave her a small bowl no charge
Carne and chicken tacos full of fresh meats not too salty and everything is made fresh
You won't be disappointed"}
{"text":"I drive up here from Southern California this my second time eating at this restaurant I must say the quality of the food brings me back. Great food great staff a must eat while in town"}
{"text":"I'm kinda new to Henderson and coming from LA it's really hard to find a Mexican food spot that's to my standards. Lol. So we came here hopeful that we'd like it. It's pretty much a hole in the wall place. Tiny parking lot but it has a drive thru which is great. The restaurant was small and cozy inside. Staff was very friendly. I ordered some enchiladas de pollo en salsa verde and my niece had the beef chimichanga. Our food was DELICIOUS!!! I think this is our new go to place for Mexican food."}
{"text":"The food is fresh, the staff is friendly the prices are cheap! exactly what I love about this no frills joint. Its a few notches above roberts for sure. I just wish they served bigger cups for the salsal!"}
{"text":"Can I just say this place made me fall in love with Mexican food all over again. And it feels like I'm cheating with my husband's grandma's cooking! Everything is authentic and it has that Mexican grandma's kitchen food vibe I've been looking for a while now. Customer service is great too! Oh yeah did I mention their flan is made in their own kitchen! 
I had the Carne asada plate and a bowl of posole (I know I'm such a pig! Lol) while my hubby had Chile relyeno, green enchilada, red Chile enchilada combination (not on their combo plate menu btw) everything was good! The Chile relyeno is worth the drive it self! Totally will come back!"}
{"text":"Love eating here whenever I'm in the Henderson area the food is really good kind of expensive but you get your money's worth for what you pay for my favorite is the Carne asada burritos and the Carne asada tacos and the cheese quesadilla that in itself is big and you get more for what you order I like this place and it is one of my favorite Mexican restaurants to eat at and the food is always delicious and it's worth the drive if you live on the southwest part of the valley or any other part of the valley I recommend you come here if you are looking for delicious Mexican food as you won't be doing at all."}
{"text":"I love this place.  It is great, cheap mexican restaurant that I wish was on every corner!  The people are friendly and super fast with the food.  Usually I get a combo meal that is about $6.  So great.  They also have a drive-thru if you are in a rush. Go Santa Rosa Taco Shop!!!"}
{"text":"Came here from reading reviews since we were from out of town. It's one of those places that we call a yummy hole in the wall places. It was really great food and their mini quesadilla was HUGE. I had the three tacos, not the best refried beans I've ever had but good."}
{"text":"Great  place to get a quick lunch on the go, when your in, or around downtown Henderson. 

The carne asada nachos are the bomb. Loaded with meat, cheese, beans, guacamole and crema! 

A favorite of me, and Deadpool is the Asada Chimichanga loaded with meat and topped with lots of guacamole. 

If you get a quesadilla order it with extra cheese and be awesome."}
{"text":"Found this place from Yelp... so thank you... place is VERY small and very easy to miss... right across the street from the Henderson detention center!

Food is good... not as big of portions as Robertos but better quality is seems.  The California burrito is awesome... the super nachos aren't my fav... Robertos were better in my mind.... still good little place!"}
{"text":"Amazing food as always! Never have been disappointed, the tamales are amazing and the carne asada fries are the best around!  We stop by 2 to 3 times  every time we are in Vegas!"}
{"text":"Fun fact, this place is owned by the same people that own Roberto's. The prices are pretty spot on with what you would pay at other taco shops, but the menu at Santa Rosa is much larger. Unfortunately I thought the food was very bland. The carrots and onions that I love to munch on had no flavor and not even a hint of spice. I tried to doctor it up with salt and lime but it still didn't really help. Our dinners weren't much better.

We ordered the #12 which is a cheese enchilada and chile relleno plate with rice and beans, carne asada nachos, and two chicken tacos. The tacos are $1 on Tuesdays. The food looked great. The combo plate was smothered in red enchilada sauce and cheese, but sadly the dish lacked much flavor. I did enjoy the rice and beans; the rice tasted like someone's grandma made it. The tacos weren't bad and I appreciated that they were honoring taco Tuesday. Unfortunately though because of it's distance from me and the lack of any real flavor, I wouldn't come back here."}
{"text":"I just found out about this place.  It's around the corner from my job and has a drive thru! Which is perfect for me because I'm always on the go. Amazing carne Asada Burrito!!"}
{"text":"Awesome hidden gem!! Food was delicious. The employee that helped us was so great. You could tell he was new because the manager seemed to be giving him a hard time, but he was so sweet. I will definitely be going back."}
{"text":"This place is absolutely amazing. The bean and cheese burrito, chicken nachos, and chicken salad is so good. Totally come to this place all the time :)"}
{"text":"Amazing food and service. Best part they have a drive through!!! The menu has a great variety of food. Definitely would recommend this restaurant."}
{"text":"I ordered the menudo and pozole. per my husband menudo was good I had the pozole and it was missing flavor and chili. Would love to try their other stuff."}
{"text":"Great food!! Being from Southern California I miss all the Hispanic inspired foods. I must say this place has an authentic taste!!

Ps
The best carne asada nachos and fries in Henderson!!"}
{"text":"I love this place. Don't blink or you will miss it. It's tucked away. Nice employees, and delicious food."}
{"text":"Excellent customer  service and great chicken tacos'
Yummmmmy !  Breakfast burritos and California burritos are very tasty as well!  Try this place if your ever out in older Henderson!!"}
{"text":"The menu here is strangely similar to Roberto's taco shop. Do the same people own it?  
 
I ordered the special of the day - 3 chicken enchiladas with green sauce. The chicken on its own was tender but not memorable. The green sauce was a little watery but just spicy enough. The meal came with rice, beans, and a medium drink-all for $ 5.50. In other words, an average meal at a good price.

I am giving this place 4 stars for the one menu item that stood out. The carne asada fries were amazing!  Crispy shoestring fries topped with steak, cheese, guacamole, sour cream, beans, onions, tomatoes, and cilantro -YES!

The place is located in a dumpy area of Henderson -but a solid option if you want good fast Mexican food."}
{"text":"We were in the area and wanted Mexican food that was close to our hotel.  We saw this was rated as 41/2 star and wanted to try it. It's a nice small place located in an industrial area, not on the main road.  My wife tried the taco and enchilada combo.  I guess her taco had a strong taste and smell of pepper it wasn't bad but she didn't finish the taco, the enchilada  she polished it off.  I had the Carnitas plate which I shared the rice and beans with my daughter.  I made my Carnitas into a burrito and it was great!  You get one free refill on your soda drinks.  I do wished they let you refill your soda fountains yourself. . .businesses made so much profit on fountain drinks. . I hate when they go cheap! If I'm in the area again, I think I would recommend my friends to check this place out."}
{"text":"Santa Rosa's been hanging out on Basic for quite some time.  It's a staple in some Hendersonian's lives, and although I've sampled a few things from there I've never really embraced it like other taquerias that just constantly have me coming back for more.  I don't know if the grease they used for their fried things doesn't get changed too often or their preparation just doesn't get my toes-a-tappin'.  It's not bad.  If people were going there and bringing something back, I'd totally throw in for a little something if I were hungry.  But I'd never go here on my own accord."}
{"text":"I hadn't been here since I was in high school and it was really good then as it is now. The place is really clean as another worker was washing everything. It looks a little run down, but don't let that fool you. Keep in mind the building is really old. The food was excellent and I had my old staple favorite chicken quesadilla and I tried the carne asada fries. I forgot the fries had onions and pico de gallo in it which one I don't like and the other I am allergic to if it's not fully cooked. So I couldn't eat all the fries. Good thing my friend was there. He had the beef chimichanga. The prices are a bit expensive, but you really do get what you pay for. The portions are huge! The guacamole could use a tad more volume, but still delicious. I recommend eating here to satisfy your cravings for burritos and quesadillas. :)"}
{"text":"I come here mostly for the breakfast burritos.  I've gotten lunch a few times.  When in a hurry I call my order in and pick up through the drive thru.  The employees working are always friendly and when I don't call it in they are still pretty fast.  Menu, taste and price is very similar to Roberto's and Fausto's to me.  Not much to set it apart.  Good but not amazing.  Still worth a stop if you are in the area."}
{"text":"This place is awesome! the staff are super friendly. The enchiladas were really good! Next time i am gonna try the tacos,
They look really good as well. The prices are just right. Excited to come back next week. Give this place a try!"}
{"text":"Huge fan of the breakfast burritos,  we're here every Saturday (they're now closed Sunday). Lunch worthy food is always good too.  I feel their quality is better than Roberto's &  Fausto's. They have several sauces,  my favorite are the roasted red and avocado green."}
{"text":"Small little hole in the wall spot - HUGE delicious plates!! After day of drinks and too much sun, we needed a real solid meal. My brother in law found this spot and hesitantly, we left the hotel to try it out. So glad we did!! Cheap but delicious - the meat was on point. Everyone ordered different plates and everyone loved what they got. I had both the carne asada plate and the carne asada fries. The carne asada fries are a must have. Ridiculous amount of food - fries piled with guac, sour cream, cheese, and really well made carne asada all over it. Get it!!! Need a food fix after a Vegas weekend - this is your spot!"}
{"text":"Ordered the chicken taco and chicken enchilada combo, it was pretty good. And of course got a churro which was amazing. Full of cinnamon and cooked in the middle, perfect."}
{"text":"Ordered Tacos Carne Asada.  Food  is freshly made, but the asada was a little to dry.  Little local taco shop, clean.  The food is bland for Mexican food."}
{"text":"Dropped by for $1 chicken taco night. The taco shells were home made and deep fried with the chicken meat in them. Horrible."}
{"text":"For a quick Mexican food fix, this is the place, y'all. I've had the chicken chimichanga, carne asada chimichanga, cheese quesadilla and a basic bean burrito. All were muy bueno (that means very good, by the way. You're welcome.)

The inside is clean but really small. There are only a few tables so it can get crowded if you go at peak times but I've also been there at dinner time and it was pretty empty so it's just hit and miss as far as the crowd. I normally go through the drive through where they have a huge menu board complete with pictures for most items (good for gringas like me who aren't super knowledgable about Mexican food). 

The chimichangas (my personal favorite menu item) are solidly on point. They're nice and crisply fried on the outside but slightly soft on the inside and filled with all sorts of goodness. The carne asada is almost always cooked perfectly (full disclosure: I have had it once or twice when it wasn't all that great-I chalked it up to an off night for the cook). They do the chimis up full scale with sour cream, guacamole and cheese on top and pair it with some awesome refried beans and rice. It's easily enough for 2 or 3 meals for me. 

The location is almost hidden but it's just off Water Street across from the Henderson Detention Center. If you didn't know it was there, you'd never guess cause it's sort of away from all the surrounding businesses in downtown Henderson. 

I think it's just as good, if not better, than Roberto's or Faustos and the prices are lower than both. Give this hidden gem a try! You won't be disappointed! Adios amigos!"}
{"text":"Pigs are so cute, and taste so delicious!  

Santa Rosa is located in what looks like a block from Napoleon Dynamite's street, desolate and stopped developing in the mid-eighties. This taco shop has the classic greasy tacos and the burrito gut bombs that all red-blooded Americans have come to know and love. 

Every meal option is served with rice or beans and the plate is overflowing with salty cheesy goodness! I was craving the some old school bites so I went with a fully loaded with green chile pork plate and warm flour tortillas. This meal sort of looks like it was pre-chewed and spat back on the plate, but if you don't try this item you're missing out.

Tangy, limey, spicy, and salty, t's like the Spice Girls of Santa Rosa are tap dancing on your taste buds. The pork is slowly cooked in that amazing green chili sauce until it gets to that almost spreadable tenderness and pretty much melts in you mouth. Sorry for the cliché, but for reals, this shit is good!

Small place, large plates and easy on the wallet. Santa Rosa, winning hearts and tummies all over the place!"}
{"text":"Decent tacos, but nothing to brag about. Came here after the Henderson St. Patrick's day parade with family. I just have to try hole in the wall taco shops when I know they are close! Wasn't a disappointment, but I did not leave impressed either. Our table had a mix of chicken tacos, a shredded beef chimichanga, cheese enchiladas, and a ground beef taco. 
The ground beef taco was extremely greasy. The cheese enchiladas were decent, but bland. And everything else was simply mediocre. I was happy with the service, and the prices. But overall this was basic, fast, Mexican food with no extras. Even the carrots at the salsa bar were bland. I appreciate that they weren't soggy and old, but they still needed a little spice to them.
The avocado salsa was the best, and it needed to be replenished. 
I would eat here again, but not if there were other taco options in the area."}
{"text":"My friends & I went there, it's small I didn't even know they had seating inside, I've only used the drive-thru but lo & behold they do! Not a fancy place; clean, good food & good service & we all enjoyed our meal! I saw they have Taco Tues, perfect it's closer for me than Roberto's Taco Shop who no longer offers $1 Taco Tues!"}
{"text":"I am never disappointed with santa rose mexican food. It is now my favorite place to eat than any other. I love the tacos, burritos and everything else. Even the sauces. I would eat it everyday of the week. But your not open on sundays!!!!!! Lol...."}
{"text":"Great food like Robertos! Love the drive up window too. Affordablr and good. Love the toastadas, carne asada burritos and nachos."}
{"text":"Just ate here the other day with the family. We had the carne asada nachos, chimichanga, Cheese enchiladas, and beef burritos. It was all good we will definitely be back again."}
{"text":"Authentic as it gets.  Chicken burrito was terrific, one of the best I have ever had."}
{"text":"Hole in the Wall. My favorite type of fair. This place is small but the food is great. My first visual impression was that of Fausto's or Roberto's. That's where the similarities end. If you dine in, the food is served on actual hard plates. The service was great. The guy behind the counter, Carlos, was very nice and personable. He brought out our food when it was ready. 

The food was excellent. I had the #26 Burrito plate, served wet (enchilada style) with ground beef. Rice and beans were very good. My wife had the #1, cheese enchilada and taco w/ rice and beans. She loved it. Enchilada sauce was mild but tasty. The salsa bar had about 6 different types of salsa. Pretty good. but the one that stood out was a creamy green salsa. Reminded me of El Pollo Loco's avocado green sauce. This was a bit better. I didn't see the Horchata till we were done. It will be mine next time...

Yeah... We will be back."}
{"text":"this place was really good! the owners are very nice and it's got a real mexican home feel to it. I had the carne asada sopes, while my mom had the menudo. it was good and didn't take too long to make. it's also fairly inexpensive which is great. I'm glad I found this place, I could even walk here if I wanted to!"}
{"text":"Delicious! I've been searching for a good Mexican place since I moved from LA! Excellent beans and rice! I had enchiladas and hey were amazing! My husband got a burrito. Yum yum! We'll be back!"}
{"text":"You don't have to be slurring words to have reason to indulge yourself with Santa Rosa. Their $2.30 tacos are packed full of freshly grilled carne asada and heaping servings of pico de gallo and quacamole. One taco'll do ya, but I had two. The beans are delicious and you get free refills on Horchata. 

The service could not be friendlier. Santa Rosa also uses solid, reusable plates instead of Styrofoam, which was refreshing."}
{"text":"This place is absolutely a 5 star place because their food is amazing. Everything I've had from here is delicious. Their carne Asana burrito is my favorite. Their beans and rice is sooo good. I love their salsa bar! They have a good variety and they have pickled carrots. The people that work there are ALWAYS friendly and kind. It is my favorite place to eat Mexican for a great price. I recommend everyone to not pass this place up."}
{"text":"I was really craving menudo. I came across this place and it was amazing! The menudo was flavorful and authentic. Made fresh everyday and served with corn tortillas brought from California. The place looks run down from the outside, but delicious in the inside. Prices are great!"}
{"text":"Awesome little place! Salsas are really good, and if the salsas are good, the food is good. We had a huge order because we were in town for a baseball tournament and needless to say we have a big family."}
{"text":"The tamale did not taste fresh at all, and it didn't taste exactly like one either. There just was no taste to it, and it seemed too mushy. My husband has the chili verde and he wasn't impressed with that either. We had our hopes up do to the glowing reviews but it's not the place for us."}
{"text":"The Al Pastor Fries is delicious! The fries are thin and crispy. The meat is tender and marinated. The staff are friendly and accommodating. Will definitely come back again and again!"}
{"text":"First time here.  Food was fantastic, the best chili relleno and cheese enchilada I have had in a long time.  Unfortunately it is about 30 miles from my house, so won't get there often.  Even the beans were evcellent"}
{"text":"3 1/2

Rolled in for lunch with my coworkers. 

Initial thoughts: quaint, clean. 

Sign on the front door: no public restrooms. Hmmm, not sure that's allowed. 

Regardless, I ordered the pork carnitas plate and a drink. $10. It was very good. No complaints. Pork was crispy, tender and delicious. The plate came with lettuce, guacamole, rice, beans, and a huge delectable tortilla. It was really good, required no additional seasoning.  I couldn't finish the huge portion. 

My gal pal was thrilled with her taco salad. A fresh crunchy shell and huge chunks of chicken breast sealed the deal. It had rice, guacamole, salsa, lettuce. Yum. 

My guy pal loved his special beef burrito plate. He says 4-5 stars! Better than Robertos!

They  have a little salsa bar with 5 salsa choices and the usual limes and pickled veggies. 

The girls at the counter were super nice. Definitely comparable or better than your fave fast Mexican place. Give it a whirl if you're on the East side!"}
{"text":"I decided to swing by here one Sunday morning to get a breakfast burrito to split with my husband. I went through the drive-thru since I was still in my pajamas. The lady that helped me was chipper but not annoyingly so. 
I ordered a potato, egg and cheese burrito with pico de gallo on the side. Plus a large horchata. The burrito was perfect, I hate when the cheese isn't melted all of the way and this cheese was. 

Total damage was $6. Not bad at all, I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Don't let the size of this place fool you.  The tacos are insanely good.  The use of fresh cuts of meat and the care in preparation make these the best tacos you will ever have.  I tried the carnitas and the el pastor.  They were so good I went back the next day and had the carne asada.  They are all great.  Make an effort to try this place you will not be disappointed"}
{"text":"Love this place! Hidden gem! Very nice folks too! Best tacos around!!! Found it on Yelp and after trying a couple other places this became our go to for Mexican food."}
{"text":"I was excited to try a downtown Henderson Taco shop because I like the quaint area. This is a small establishment across of the Dentention Center so it gets a regular flow of business.
I ordered the Chile Rillenos plate, Garlic shrimp plate and a Carnitas burrito along with a Horchata drink.
I am always disappointed when an establishment doesn't meet the Yelper's rating and want to let others know my opinion.
The Chile Rillenos was average, the rice was a not as light and fluffy as I expected a 4-1/2 star rating should deliver. The Garlic shrimp was very tasty.
However, the Carnitas was over cooked and dried out. The tortilla is the elastic type made from something unhealthy like L***.
The service is great because these ladies work hard, but for the sake of my dollar value and yours......meh. It is not a 4-1/2 star place for food."}
{"text":"was looking for a small close to home shop i could eat and i'm very glad i came across this place. the food was amazing. came here with my boyfriend and his sister got our food pretty fast. i ordered the 3 small taco meal and they were delicious the meat was seasoned not like any other Mexican place i have ever gone to and it was pretty good. the prices are just like any other roberto's or fausto's but the quality to me is much better. definitely had a great experience here and definitely will be coming back!"}
{"text":"Really love this place. We drive past about 5 taco shops to go to this one about 15 minutes away. It's funny to us how many people talk about how good the breakfast burritos are because that is the item like we like the least. It's not bad but there are better. The rest of the menu is great. It's the same stuff at every taco shop it's just done well with minimal ingredients the way it should be. The sauces are pretty great. They all have a lot of lime which kicks up the flavor of everything. Rolled chicken tacos with cheese and guac topped with carne asada. Can't go wrong there."}
{"text":"El mejor quacamole de la ciudad !! Conduzco todo el camino desde Bonanza y Pecos para este quacamole !!

The best quacamole in town!! I drive all the way from bonanza and pecos for this quacamole!!"}
{"text":"I ordered my food in English, man behind the counter stared blankly an said in broken English \"credit card machine broke\" I then turned around and walked out. I'll be back with cash/money order/debit card, you can't deny me then!"}
{"text":"Stopped here coming back from the Hoover dam heading back to Vegas. Good food for cheap. Tiny place with friendly service. One of the only restaurants we could find that wasn't a chain. Would definitely recommend for some good quality Mexican!"}
{"text":"Ate here again recently. This time, I got the carne asada fries. I was greeted and served by this friendly guy. He even checked up on me after a few minutes to make sure I was enjoying my meal.

The carne asada fries themselves were pretty good. Since I ate at the restaurant, it was served on a covered plate. They even gave me napkins, which is always a necessity at Mexican joints.

The portion was huge, comparable to that of other Mexican spots. I even had enough left over for half a dinner. The guy who served me did not hesitate to give me a to-go container when I asked for it.

The red sauce and the picked carrots, jalapenos, and onions were also good. The carrots were crunchy but still had a degree of softness that made them enjoyable. The jalapenos, however, were lacking that small level of spiciness, but I still enjoyed them.

When I left, I said thank you as I enjoyed the meal and the service. Replying to me was this nice lady who said \"gracias\" as I left. Now that's friendliness, which I really appreciate.

I'll post a picture of my meal once I figure out how to do it. And I'll definitely keep coming back to this place when I'm nearby."}
{"text":"We are from Texas and we stopped here on our way out of Vegas.  The breakfast burritos are huge and so delicious. Wife had ham with onions, and I had King Burrito (which had almost all meats). We recommend ya all to try this. Thumbs up!"}
{"text":"Eating here was a delightful surprise. The food was delicious, the restaurant was clean and the menu was extensive. I particularly enjoyed that the food was served on ceramic plates and the staff brought the food out to the table."}
{"text":"Great little no frills mexican restaurant. I had a vegetarian burrito that was really good--I just wasn't crazy about the tortilla that was kind of thick and too floury. Good value though, the burrito was huge and about $5. Really good refried beans and nice little salsa bar with a lot of choices. There is also a drive through. I will be back!"}
{"text":"This place is absolutely the best in henderson if not nv...best enchaladas I've ever had in myblife ... this mexcan food is as good as it get ... if u like robertos ... then I feel bad for u son ....;)"}
{"text":"I have no idea why there are so many good reviews. The customer service was horrible. The lady taking my order had an attitude the entire time for no apparent reason. I was hoping the food would be as great as the reviews but when I returned home I was greatly disappointed. I would have rather drove the extra 3 miles to Robertos."}
{"text":"This is one of the best honestly taco shops in Henderson. We are here almost every weekend. Carne Asada breakfast burritos are delicious. My son loves the carne asada lunch burrito. I love the machaca, the plate, the burrito and the big tostada bowl."}
{"text":"The place is so clean and smelled clean and the food was so good, the green sauce was my favorite. The people working here are very clean and friendly. They have a large selection and the prices are the same anywhere else and its in a nice little area near downtown. Definitely will be coming back."}
{"text":"Drove to Vegas from Los Angeles and had a craving for some homemade Mexican food. Found this place on yelp and boy were the reviews right. The food was very authentic and most of all tasty. I had the huevos rancheros. The whole plate was flavorful. If you're looking for a whole in the wall Mexican food place this is it."}
{"text":"This place is pretty legit. Very deceiving from the outside, but quality overall. The reason I didn't rate a 5 star place is because when I bit into the delicious carne asada burrito, there were a few tiny charred pieces mixed in there that I didn't like."}
{"text":"The rating for this restaurant on yelp does not reflect my experience as a consumer. As a vegetarian I enjoy the variety of meatless options that Mexican restaurants normally offer. I ordered the chile relleno and cheese enchilada and it came with refried beans and rice. This dish was about $10. 

This dish was not good. The food did not taste fresh and the meal was overly oily. After eating part of my meal, my body just felt full and heavy. As someone who frequents Mexican restaurants often, I know that for the same amount of money, I could have gotten a better dish. 

Overall, not a place I would come back to again."}
{"text":"I ordered a chicken burrito. It was pretty good. It didn't wow me, but it wasn't bad. The location is very small and it did not some time to get my food. I would try this place again but probably something with beef."}
{"text":"Quick, cheap, and yummy--just the way I like it.  Small building, good service from behind the counter. She took our food out to us at the table.  Huevos Rancheros were bueno. Not the best rice I've had but still good, they put the cheap cheese rather than the yummy white crumbly cheese on the beans, and the carrots tasted a bit old, but all things that can be forgiven if the price is right. :) 

Will go there again when in deep Henderson and in need of a cheap meal."}
{"text":"Good little taco shop. Carne Asada tacos were good size and tasted delicious. The shredded beef tacos were just subpar, nothing fantastic about them. 
They were super friendly, and it was a nice little place to grab a quick bite. 
Would definitely visit again!"}
{"text":"Very good Mexican food!! Came here with no expectations but we were full but couldn't stop eating !!"}
{"text":"Family run. Awesome tacos. Everything is tasty, super fresh, and way affordable. Plus a drive thru. What more can you ask for?? :)"}
{"text":"First of all the food was very expensive and you got very little for your money. I ordered two chili rienos.  There was two as advertised, and they were very very small.   About two and half inches long by 1 inch wide."}
{"text":"From Virginia so maybe I just never had good mexican food... but this was the best mexican Ive ever had. Authentic mexican feel and you can tell it is a local favorite! Two thumbs up!"}
{"text":"Let me just say that for an authentic taco shop, this place hits all the spots!  The prices are absolutely legit and you get a lot of food for your money.  The place is small but the menu is huge and from carne Asada tacos to the carne Asada fries.  From fish tacos to tortas, menudo, and burritos there really isn't a bad thing on the menu.  There hot sauce is extremely tasty, and a prefect addition to anything they serve.  Another plus, is they have a drive thru.  They cook to order so if there is a line, it may take a few.  Definitely worth the wait.  If you are in the area and want a perfect lunch, please stop in!"}
{"text":"My mom and I stopped here after reading the yelp reviews while prowling for a good spot to eat.  We were pleasantly surprised and happy to find that they were open Sunday evening, since it seemed to be a smaller restaurant.
The customer service was fantastic.  My mom and I split an order of 5 rolled tacos and a carnitas plate, which was more than enough for 2 people.  Both dishes were fantastic, and we were both pleasantly surprised with the quality of the food.  We spent about $17 with drinks, but it was well worth it; we'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"I'm not sure how these guys got a 4 a half star rating. We decided to try them out after seeing the good reviews that they had.  We walked in and the smell of bleach basically ruined my appetite.  Fountain drinks stand work and it took forever to get our food. The only reason that I gave them two stars the food was actually pretty good once I got it."}
{"text":"Called In an order this morning at 8am when they opened spoke to a women stating it will only be 15 min. Within those 15 min the front door was never unlocked and we even saw a co worker open and enter establishment at 825 and she kept the door locked. I ordered 7 burritos  and had to leave bc no one had the decency to open the door. Left at 830am first time here and never returning. Common curtesy is definitely not present here.

**after leaving the establishment proceeded to call me a hour later to let me know my order is ready. I let them know we were out front for 30 min and the lady called me a liar and stated that wasn't true. I let her know calmly I would not lie over any matter. The fact that the business went to that extreme instead of simply apologizing and moving on shows they have a lot to learn in the hospitality business."}
{"text":"Great for what it is. My family and I visit this taco shop often and I sometimes study here for school - when I don't need wi-fi. They have very consistently delicious tacos. And most of the food is pretty on par.

Every once in a while we get a mess up or they're pretty slow. But overall, they are great, family owned, local, authentic taco shop."}
{"text":"Best fast food Mexican food you'll ever have! Always hot and fresh with homemade tortillas. Stop there every time I'm on that side of town."}
{"text":"Best tacos we've had in a long time ! $1 taco Tuesdays. Much better than Robertos! New favorite place!"}
{"text":"I can't say enough good things about Santa Rosa. Every time I go in or even through the drive thru service is always impeccable!  Food is always delicious. Today is taco Tuesday so I had Chicken Tacos!  Best in town in my opinion!"}
{"text":"First time we came here, they forgot an item (which wasn't really a big deal as we noticed before we left) as soon as I let them know they quickly corrected it and added two free Pepsi's. After trying the food I knew we'd be back. Since then we haven't gone to any of our usual taco spots. Food is delicious, had the supreme rolled tacos (no lettuce) and they were not disappointing. 
Food is delicious and customer service is outstanding!"}
{"text":"1st time here. Like most Vegas \"Taco shops,\" this has almost the exact same menu. Everything from the \"guac\" to the tacos are almost exactly the same. Like they all go to a Mexican taco stand school and learn the exact same recipes. Not complaining.. Just stating an observation.

I've realized over the years, that these shops are only different when going by their salsa bar. Some have more or less salsa options. This place happens to have the best variety I've seen. Red, green, verde, guac salsa, restaurant style, and one other! Pretty impressive. Like a good buttermilk ranch dressing, a good salsa could be the main reason I come back to an establishment..

I ordered a the chimichanga and 2 chicken tacos, since it is Taco Tuesday aka $1 chicken tacos.

The chimi was good, about the same as others I've had, and the chicken tacos were exactly the same as Roberto's or the other non-chain places in town. Just switch the white cheese at Roberto's with yellow here.. 

Service was fast and \"nice enough.\"

Just don't go between 11-2, if you can help it. ALL of downtown lawyers, DA's, police, etc etc crowd this place up for lunch."}
{"text":"Santa Rosa is literally right across the street from my office building, so close that I could throw a rock and hit it.  Having said that, I don't go very often at all because I try to make healthier choices, at least during the work week.  I ventured over there this past week and had the beef tamale combo with rice and beans.  The food was delicious and filling, as usual; I ate one and a half of the two tamales, the rice, and the beans before I had to stop.  The staff is always very friendly and the place is clean.  Nice little spot for some Mexican food if you're ever in the area and tiene hambre."}
{"text":"I've been going to Santa Rosa for years now - not only is it very convenient to my house, they (still) have a drive thru and the food is delicious!

I am updating my review because they have recently updated their menu.  They've added quite a few items.

My Mom used to always order the combo with 1 chile relleno and 1 cheese enchilada, but would switch the enchilada for a 2nd relleno.  Well, she doesn't have to do that anymore, because they've added a 2 chile relleno combo to the new menu!  Hooray!

Most recently, I decided to try the new \"super\" rolled tacos - which are 5 rolled tacos with sour cream, guacamole, cheese and topped with carne asada.  Wow, were they good!  And very filling.

They still have the same friendly service and reasonable prices.  The only downside is that they are only open until 9pm, so it's not a good place for a late night munchie run."}
{"text":"Awesome food. We just moved from SoCal and needed to find a down home family place to eat this hit the nail on the head."}
{"text":"My friends and I came here after our weekend trip to Vegas. We are all from Southern California where we are used to authentic, good Mexican food and let me tell you, this place was what we expected! The food was delicious, I got a number 1 combo and the enchilada and beef taco was amazing. The customer service was great, very friendly and helpful. Definitely come here if you have the chance!"}
{"text":"Bomb.com! We were staying at the Westin lake Las Vegas wanted to have something different than hotel food andddddd not drive far well this place was pretty dang good and fed a fam of 5 for less than 30! What?!? YA awesome sauce dude! We may skip sushi dinner and get this again taco shop gots us feeling homesick missing SD"}
{"text":"A block down the street from work and they have AMAZING Carne Asada fries, that I cannot finish by myself. I really, really wish they did... the Small box for carne asada fries. Also had the Breakfast burrito on another day, which was delicious too. Their salsa bar is always kept clean and looks freshly made. Will definitely keep coming here when I keep forgetting my lunch."}
{"text":"This is a place you'd drive by, and think to avoid at all costs. You would be sadly mistaken to do this, their food is amazing. I tried the tostada and enchilada combo, and was not disappointed. The only reason I gave 4 instead of 5 stars, is the fact that in an attempt to be polite, professional and courteous, the young man set down our utensils by touching the prongs of our forks. The interior of the quaint dining area could use a face lift, but I'm glad to have eaten and enjoyed the food."}
{"text":"Excellent fresh food. I typically only order the breakfast burritos, tortas or salad and they never disappoint. Great service also!"}
{"text":"My favorite place in the Las Vegas henderson valley bar none everything is fresh and wonderfully made if you want some good good food come here."}
