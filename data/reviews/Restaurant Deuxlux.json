{"text":"I give this restaurant a 2 stars because I consider one star to be for a place where nothing was good. We were a group of about 20. The staff was nice and effective. The food was well cooked but that's it. No flavour in any dishes and i tastes multiple plates from our group. Chicken was tender but literally no seasoning at all. The Brie sauce was brietasteless. The veal poutine was very very very watery. It tasted like a melting pot of left overs soaked in water sauce with no seasonings. A more rich sauce would have been a good idea. 26$ for a tasteless poutine is too much. Wouldn't recommend"}
{"text":"Ayant vu ce restaurant en passant, décidâmes de l'essayer. Hésitions puisque les recensions étaient très partagées. Conclusion : déçus. Très cher pour la qualité. Des associations d'ingrédients douteuses (brie, canard en \"bacon\" et linguini...25$). Le potage aux légumes goûtait le prefait, les bouillons commerciaux. 
Cher! 9$ pour une entrée de 3 morceaux de baguettes avec petite garniture... Parmesan faux (ou alors canadien? et pas italien). Imposer 5$ si on ne prend que des entrées et imposer de manger pour plus de 23$ pour éviter cette \"taxe\" repas. 
Et très très bruyant. Vaisselle de cantine. 
Pas très propre...
Le meilleur à table était ... la bouteille! Gaspiller un 1er cru de Bourgogne sur cela ...
Pour le même prix et un réel bon repas italo-canadien allez chez Roberto rue Bélanger."}
{"text":"This is my favourite little Italian restaurant in Montreal. I grew up in a small town surrounded by Italians and the pasta sauce used in Chef Jimmy's recipes bring me back to my childhood! The prices are probably lower then they should be but I am not going to argue! Chef Jimmy is a super friendly guy, treats my wife and I like celebrities every time we eat there. If I had to make a few suggestions for first timers the gnocchi poutine is our personal favourite starter, also the sausage rappini is out of this world (once again the sauce) service has also been on point and we have yet to have a bad experience! 

  I always recommend anyone coming to visit me in Montreal to stop in at Deuxlux! I tell them to say \"manga cake\" sent you. Inside joke (an Irish kid growing up around Italians). Can't say enough good things about this restaurant. Go, try it for yourself and enjoy!"}
{"text":"Très bon resto! Proprio sympathique, la polpetti est gigantesque, moule frite excellente et le spécial pâte super. Prix abordable"}
{"text":"Petit resto italien apporter votre vin. Nous avions un menu de groupe donc certains plats différaient de ce que l'on retrouve normalement sur le menu. J'ai commandé les moules sauce provençale et la sauce était définitivement le highlight de mon repas. Petite entrée de salade un peu trop basique à mon goût: salade verte, une tomate cerise coupée en deux et quelques concombres. Ca manquait de vinaigrette d'ailleurs. Desserts classiques italien. Les prix sont très raisonnables et ils ont même une soirée ladys night le jeudi soir avec dessert et entrée gratuite."}
{"text":"Once again like the night before my meal was excellent but I do try others and also go by the rest of my gang.
First this place is very small and very tight. e were a big group and this was not the place for us. It was also very noisy.
I have the Moules(Mussels) provencal and they were excellent. 5 stars for that but the rest is all down hill. Oh the service was also pretty good.
My wife ordered the meat platter and it was really not that good. I tried all 3 meats and only the chicken was just OK!!! Fries were excellent.
My friend had the pasta and was told it was just tasteless and not good at all.
As I starter I ordered a Brie and that was also very good. 
Would I go back. Yes but only for the mussels and brie. And would only god with my wife."}
{"text":"Where do i start? The service was very good! But it ends there. Food was one of the worst. My husband and i ordered marinara mussels, fried calamari for appetizers. House pasta and lamb shank for main. It came with a choice of soup or salad. We both took the salad. We were told that it would have a balsamic vinaigrette but the salad came without any. The bread basket was sliced sandwich bread from the market. The industrialized ones. Then, the mussels...they were so tasteless! The calamari came with a cold tomato sauce and mayo. Yes, mayo from a tub. The pasta said to be served with a prosciutto rosé sauce but the chef forgot the prosciutto. My lamb was so salty from the powdered sauce mix and the pasta had cream thrown into it. Both dishes had over cooked pasta. And ya, my husband had a chunk of sugar in his pasta sauce! Nothing was good. Everything was bad! I felt like the owners thought that we as customers are idiots and that we could/would eat all this crap and pay for it! Will never recommend this place to anyone. Will never set foot in this place even if it were to be the only restaurant available!"}
