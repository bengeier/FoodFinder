{"text":"Went for the first time and they gave me a stale piece of cake.. What kind of garbage is that. Like it had sat in the back or something all day. Worst place ever don't ever come here"}
{"text":"Chicken Empanadas=Delish!!! 
Gotta try them! I wasn't very fond of the beef :p

I heart their Ube (purple yam) cake! Delish....moist...the best!"}
{"text":"I came today 750am.2 ladies,one in dark brown uniform,one in beige were both fixing the shelf.They were very unfriendly esp the one in beige.Wont even look at me.They made me feel i bothered them at what they were doing.I only went there because Valerio's bakeshop was still closed.
Not only were they more expensive but their chicken pie was not as good."}
{"text":"The food was mediocre.  I tried the glass noodle dish, but the flavor was bland.  The beef empanadas were slightly salty.  The only thing I liked there was the chicken empanadas.  The bread cover was slightly sweet over tasty shredded chicken making a good balance.  

The cakes look good but not moist enough for my taste."}
{"text":"Ordered halo halo which is pretty decent. A good treat for a hot day.  They could improve on their leche flan though, it is not creamy and looks gelatinous. 
Also ordered sponge cake/mamon for takeout which is pretty good as well."}
{"text":"I stopped by in the afternoon (Friday), after 5pm, and though there weren't a lot of people,  the service was awfully slow (took 1/2 hr just to get a cake at the counter, and there was only ONE person ahead of me!).
I got the coffee cake, and well, just like the poor service, the cake was not good at all: I bought the coffee cake but got white cake with caramel chunks only!
The only good thing about it is that since it was pretty much plain, I was able to throw in some caramel syrup around it and aborted birthday cake disaster"}
{"text":"I only frequent Red Ribbon for their cakes. I love their cakes, especially the mango and choco mocha crunch flavor. Recently bought the choco mocha crunch for my mom's bday party and everyone that tasted it, asked for another slice.  The cake is moist and it isn't as sweet.  It's like biting a slice of heaven!"}
{"text":"I came upon the Red Ribbon Bakeshop when I was waiting for Rocket Fizz to open just down the strip mall. I went in to see what types of bake goods were there. I've heard of Jollibee from Buzzfeed but I had no clue that they were housed in the same building. My eyes mostly when to the bread wall than the cakes (those the mango cake slices looked inviting). I love mocha so I bought the Mocha sponge cake and the Taisan chiffon slice. The taisan was kind of dull. Very light sponge and not very flavorful. The mocha sponge was great! It had the taste of mocha and was also very light despite being 240 calories (Got to put in extra work at the gym). My visit was very nice and I look forward to trying other things."}
{"text":"Great bakery but it's a bit pricy. The UBE aka Toro flavored cakes are awesome but there's just a preservative feel to them."}
{"text":"This place leave so bad business for people...  They say they close at 11 but dont want to sell ANYTHING after 10.... Don't understand how the manager or the owner let this happen..  Such a good cakes for a horrible service"}
{"text":"I've never had a problem any time I've gone here and the deserts are always good. When I purchased the sheet mango cake for my nice's party it was a hit, not a slice left."}
{"text":"Horrible service! I ordered $145 worth of pastries and they overcharged me with sansrival that I never ordered. I called them to have them remove the charge, and the supervisor said, they can't refund the charge! Worst guest service ever!"}
{"text":"Two words.

MANGO CAKE!!!!

Try it and you will know what I mean."}
{"text":"I've always had good service here and was so thrilled when they opened since it meant I no longer had to drive to Maryland Parkway for some good ube macapuno cake. The quality is usually consistently good with the rare hiccup. I love that they have individual cake slices in a variety of flavors when I just want a little bit or I'm craving a selection."}
{"text":"These delectables are the truth! When I put the chocolate cake near my face, the aroma wafted into my nose as I bit into it.  Amazed at how delicious it was, I had to grasp the steering wheel while I was driving! Even the chiffon cake was tasty- I don't even care for non-chocolate desserts. This is the epitome of a great deal- it was $1.19!! Forget cheap, mainstream brands that are not worth mentioning...this brand is inexpensive and delicious- now that's #flavafull!"}
{"text":"I've always loved Red Ribbon cakes, they never disappoint! Their cakes are very moist and not too sweet. My favorite is the mango cake, which uses whipped cream frosting. 

My only suggestion - don't ask them to write on the cake. They do it nicely, but with transportation, because of the consistency of the icing on top, causes the letters to shift."}
{"text":"I'm Filipino and I don't even like Halo-Halo, but theirs is so delicious!  The only reason I tried the Halo-Halo here was because my aunt was excited to order this for me on my trip to Vegas, I didn't have the nerve to tell her I don't like Halo-Halo... My husband, who also isn't a big Halo-Halo fan, really enjoyed Red Ribbon's version."}
{"text":"I love this place! They have all sorts of cakes and breads that I still need to try. Chicken empanadas are bomb! Good service too"}
{"text":"The only thing I get at Red Ribbon (and you have to call 24 hours ahead) are the specialty cakes. When I have an office party the Mango cake is always a hit, not too sweet and not too tart. If you need it decorated it's best you go in and spell out the name to go on the cake (it's ok if it's as simple as Mike) as sometimes things get lost in translation over the phone.

As far as service, it's always a hit and miss as the counter help is never the same and they seem to always act like space cadets when they're ringing up your order. I believe this has more to do with lack of training versus lack of trying."}
{"text":"Most of there items are sent form California. They are hard by the time they get to you. Not my first choice for Filipino pastries/baked goods."}
{"text":"I visited another Filipino Bakeshop (who shall remain un-named) and was left with sheer disappointment. So I took my butt over here and it was the best decision of that day. I grabbed the chocolate cake (chocolate lovers cake I think?) and it as moist, dense, and not overly sweet. It's like what you would imagine the cake in the movie Matilda would taste like. You know, the scene where one of the kids get forced to eat the Principal's cake? Yeah, it looks like how that would taste but better looking. The service was quick, and professional. I might go back again later this month to get a slice for myself."}
{"text":"I love Red Ribbon bakery, but this location is really rather sad. The pancit palabok was embarrassing and the lumpia was clearly frozen in the middle when I ordered from here. I came here so excited because I hadn't had any Filipino food in Phoenix in a couple of years (unless I made it myself),but it fell short in every sense of the word. The people at the counter did not know the products. Two star location, rounded to 3 stars because at least they didn't screw up that magical Mango Cake of theirs...Red Ribbon's Mango Cake forever."}
{"text":"Oh, Red Ribbon, how I used to love thee... 

I stopped in with the bf the other night for some dessert. Luckily, they had just what I wanted... slices of ube cake and mocha chocolate crunch. We had just stuffed our faces for dinner elsewhere, so we ordered some slices to go and headed home. Once I was able to change out of my slacks and put on some sweat pants, I dug right into the cakes.

Sadly, they didn't live up to what I had experienced before. The mocha chocolate crunch lacked the mocha and the crunch. And both cakes were dry and missing a bit of the sweetness.

I've had wonderful cakes from here before, so I'll come again to see if I can get what I've been craving."}
{"text":"On previous visits, I've had decent service and always liked their chicken empanadas, which I still like. And If I happen to be at AZ mills already, then I'd deal with the luke warm service just to order one to munch on while shopping.  So, prior to today, I would have rated them a 3 or 4 star. 

Today, I drove out just because my brother had been really craving a good piece of cake. So we trekked it out to Red Ribbon.   Starting with the good.  The eating area was clean.  My almost 2 year old daughter loved playing on the cool orange chairs.  

Unfortunately, my brother & I don't recommend going out of your way, like we did, just to come & try Red Ribbon at AZ Mills.  So, Now with the not so good, my brother decided on a red velvet cupcake.  There were three on a tray along with 3 chocolate mint cupcakes and a white cupcake.  The sales lady told him, \"Oh that's just for display.\"  My brother & I exchange glances, because he was just joking about this possibly happening!   

The sales lady promptly suggested we buy the four pack of mint chocolate cupcakes. My brother didn't like the look of the chocolate cupcakes, plus he only wanted one!  So, he asked for the only other cupcake option, one white cupcake. She told him it was for display also. 

I suggested that maybe they should sell the cupcakes individually. She responded that they do that. So, I was thinking OK, so why can't he order that red velvet cupcake? but oh, well, maybe it was old. 

Slightly perturbed, but not yet willing to abandon our quest, i ordered the Ube Boba Shake, because they were out of Mango.  While my bro made his final choice, he noticed there was one white cupcake, that was in the tall refrigerator behind the counter.  It was inside a plastic four pack container, along with one chocolate mint cupcake.  The lady said, \"Oh, that's just icing from a previous mango cupcake...\" My bro asked to see that one anyway. 

She seemed to me, to be reluctant as she went to the fridge & got out the pack. And lo and behold, it was not just icing, it was a white cupcake. Odd that she would tell us that it was just icing. 

So, my brother asked if he could get that one, specifically pointing to the white cupcake in the pack. The lady again, proceeded to put the four pack of mint chocolate cupcakes in a bag... 

My brother & looked at each other again. I told her that this was just confusing and that she looked like she was getting stressed out & I apologized for that. But, my bro wanted that one white cupcake. She finally rung us up for that mango cupcake. Relieved to be done with us, she quickly asked the next customer if she could help them, without giving me my Ube Shake. I asked if it was ready?  Without saying anything, she walked away to the back, then came back & told me they're still making it. In my head, I'm thinking, OK....I just don't get the feeling that we are a valued customer. 

While waiting for my shake, I tasted the cupcake that was so difficult to get.  I liked the icing, because it was light and not overly sweet.  But the cupcake itself, was nothing special to write about.   My brother also told me he tried their pancit on a previous visit and thought it was, in his words \"Blegh!\"   I told him how I like their chicken empanadas, but he was no longer interested in trying anymore of their food. 

When I finally got my shake shortly after, it was nice & cold and had a thick texture like a shake should have, but really did not taste great. Mainly because the boba had a strange texture to it, like some parts were hard and some semi soft.   Also, to be fair, I'm usually not an ube fan in general. But, even still, I just thought it tasted bland and with a hint of sweetness/ chalkiness. I guess I was hoping for something more exotic with such a bold purple color. I think the price of $3 something after taxes is high for what you get.   I suggest taking two more steps passed Red Ribbon to Gloria Jeans or Haagen Daz if just want a good shake.  And I will save my Boba Shake cravings for Lollicup or AZ Boba Tea House. 

So unfortunate that we didn't have a good experience at all.  I really want to support our local Filipino restaurants. Hence, why we went out of our way to get to Red Ribbon.    I feel bad giving them a 1 star, so I'm giving them an extra star...If Red Ribbon can improve on their customer service at least, then I would recommend people  try it.  Because I'm sure they've got to have something good on their menu, it's just we didn't have any luck with what we ordered nor with the service..."}
{"text":"Ok we hit bakeries all over the nation during our annual road trips. We have tried many different ethnic bakeries but yet to really try an authentic Filipino one. So of course we had to come here and was super excited. Even a local friend who is also a famed baker in town  came with us and liked this place. So we got our hopes way up. 
I already knew what I wanted to get here. Wanted to try their porridge or some of their dishes but when we got up to order we realized it's so pricey for the small amount they give in a Styrofoam bowl :( so we opted not to get our food there but at Grill city across from them. We did pick up two Ube cakes to try. Looked so soft and good n purple :) but upon trying it, it was just ok. Can't really tell the Ube flavor at all and reminded us of any other Asian soft sponge cake we have had. No big deal :( what I really wanted to come n try is their halo halo but our local friend recommended to get it at the halo halo place instead so next time will head there."}
{"text":"The mango cake was excellent, not too sweet, which was greatly appreciated and the cake was very fine. The weird thing was that I had called about two hours beforehand to reserve a cake and asked them to write \"Happy birthday\" on it. When I got there to pick up my cake, they finally decided to write happy birthday. This was slightly annoying because what if I had been in a rush?"}
{"text":"Three words. Brazo de Mercedes. 

I come here mainly for this amazing cake, just like how I go to the Louvre just for the Monalisa. Except, I can't eat Monalisa. It is not a rolled cake made from soft meringue with custard filling, like the Brazo De Mercedes. 

What's good about it? The sponge like texture of the meringue literally melts in my mouth. My jaw loves the break. Plus, the light flavor of the meringue is balanced by the flavor of the rich custard filling. Absolutely delicious! 

I closed my eyes, took a good bite and devoured life while imagining myself being somewhere in sunny Boracay..."}
{"text":"The name confuses me, as in the US, first place usually gets a BLUE ribbon and red is given to second place. I wouldn't rate this place #1 bakery or anything, but I'm curious about the name chosen.

I don't care for the ube cake everyone here raves about, but the vivid color is cool. The mango bar is sweeter than expected but not off-putting. 

But the empanadas are where it's at! Both times I've been in, they only had beef available so I have yet to try the chicken. Empanadas are kept in a warmer and a good size for the low price. Will continue coming back for these!"}
{"text":"Maybe I haven't been here in a while but when we do, we come for a cake in celebration of someones birthday, and i was Really disappointed that the ONE CAKE we came for had to be thee smallest size ever in relation to the other cakes for sale. Sansrival cake is so delicious, they should make a larger (party) version. The mini portion they sell I can devour on my own, im just saying. Also, they sell cakes yet they \"cant write any greeting on it\", it's a bakery for crying out loud, you should be able to write at least HAPPY BIRTHDAY. other than that, i guess if you into filipino baked goods then come here ."}
{"text":"Love Red Ribbon, our families used to order beautiful customized cakes here but they stop making customized cakes we hope they bring it back one day. We also love buying mamons here for our kids but it sucks because when you open the wrapper and remove the mamon, top of the mamon is all gone left with the wrapper lol!!! I hope they can improve that issue.

By the way...
Make sure when you're buying a cake you come at a early time and not when it's almost closing time and you watch where they get the cake from and not from the display. I was not a happy customer when my hubby brought the cake home. 

Also for any last minute occasion when buying a cake and having it with greetings/lettering for the occasion, don't buy the mango cake (we all know mango cake is yummy) because the greetings/lettering will melt away, move in all different directions or all letterings will combine as one. 

When buying a cake, buy it early morning is the best and always ask when do new cakes comes - so you know how long the cake is good for.

Enjoy the rest of the goodies"}
{"text":"This is a typical franchised store with pre made items. The service is terrible (you have to expect this from a lot of Filipino stores) they greet you and then go to the back for 15 minutes or no one is at the counter at all and the food is mediocre. This is a great place for cakes and pastries. I come in for the mango cake and mamon. Nothing frilly or over the top here."}
{"text":"Came here for some Ube sweets.  We found what we were looking for without any issued.  Excellent texture, taste and moisture level.  I will be back here for more."}
{"text":"I do love Red Ribbon.  I know the cakes are not fresh and are probably mass produced but they are still tasty.

The brazo de mercedes is also delicious.  I believe they should have a wider selections of cakes my the slice.  I am a local but I bring family and friends in from out of town and they want to have a slice of cake, not a whole cake and then go back to the strip!

Also, I know there is Jolibee and Chow King next door but the savory food offerings here are extremely lacking.  They do it better in Virginia Beach."}
{"text":"This review is not for my experience in the store.. I was given a cake and had no choice in the taste of it. So I will come later and give this place another shot,

The cak ethat I was given as a present for my birtday at work was horrid. It was beautiful on the out side.. i almost didnt want to cut into it. The inside was icky though. I'm not sure what flavor it was, it tasted sort of like carmel mocha tres leche or something with the same texture. But a thing you must know is I hate tres leche. It just tastes too milky."}
{"text":"I stopped in for a quick bite before going to the movies. I ordered the sotanghon.  I thought it would be quick. However, the lady behind the counter was talking on the phone while she was preparing my food, so it took quite a while.

Once I got it, I had to scarf it down to make it in time for the movie. It was pretty good, kind of like a cross between palabak and pancit. I doubt I'd go back though...good but not memorable."}
{"text":"I love the siopao. Soft white bread. Delicious pork filling. I ordered a pack for a small discount and cooked these for lunch at work. 30 seconds in the microwave and a very very tasty lunch!"}
{"text":"Not so good halo halo... sorry.  It was quite dry and the flavors weren't all that interesting to me.  The colors were artificial and the textures were hard to digest.

I came here just for my halo halo craving, and it didn't go so well.  Maybe go for some of the other sweets... but I don't think I'd be back."}
{"text":"Just like any franchise this place is well run and manage. Came here for the empanadas. Price is a bit high compared to other bakeries. Come here for the specialty pastries and cakes for a taste of home."}
{"text":"Red Ribbon is right beside Jollibee which was very fitting. A Filipino bakery stocked with Filipino desserts. We came here specifically for the ube cake because I didn't know such a thing existed. I am a huge fan of ube ice cream, so I had to try the cake out for myself. We left with the ube and the mango cakes. The cakes were spot on for the flavors, but the moisture was lacking. The mango was much more moist that the ube, maybe because they were pre-sliced and refrigerated. Maybe you can ask them for a fresh slice when you decide to try for yourself."}
{"text":"Red Ribbon serves a few Filipino dishes but is mainly known as a bakeshop so don't expect their meals to be that great. The dinuguan (pork blood stew) lacked meat and was too soupy and the palabok (filipino rice noodle dish) is mushy like it was cooked in a microwave. It's best to get these dishes at an actual Filipino restaurant. The bakeshop, however, has some pretty good fare. Some cakes are better than others but one must try their ube(purple yam) cake. I suggested it to a friend and she loved the novelty of it. It has a very light and sweet flavor. I like taking home the different sponge cakes, also called mamon, and the sweet brioche or ensaymada. Just make sure to check the expiration dates on the pre-packaged goodies because they have a short shelf life."}
{"text":"I purchased a whole Sansrival cake, Mamon, and Brownies with Cashews. The brownies were mushy (like how I remembered it)...but the Sansrival? TO DIE FOR! Delicious!!! I want to go back!"}
{"text":"Delicious Cakes and if you like empanadas, they actually serve Beef Empanadas. Clean environment. Love the MABON!"}
{"text":"Red Ribbon Bakeshop is a chain restaurant from the Philippines with locations in California and Hawaii. This is the only one I know of in Arizona. Think Paradise Bakery, Filipino style. It's in Tempe Mills Mall near the food court. 

My fiance and I went for dinner. I had pancit palabok and he had sotanghon. He got the $8.95 meal, which came with a drink and piece of cake. He got ube cake. The restaurant has all kinds of Filipino pastries, like mamon and ensaimada. 

I liked everything about this place. The service was fast and friendly and the food was cheap. Of course no one can make pancit palabok better than my Tita Fe, but this is a nice place for a quick Filipino fix."}
{"text":"My only complaint... Your arroz caldo bowl for SMD4 is SMALLER than the picture :/ 

Otherwise we love your chicken empanadaaaaas :D They're the only ones, of the Filipino bakeries we've tried, that hit the hunger pang. Especially fresh made earlier in the day when they're hot from the oven!

Your cakes! Googlie-beadly eye looking cakes! Like the Ube and Mango mmmmmmzz! Those chocolate cake singles - so dang moist we need ice cream with that... Specifying 'need'. 

Then, gotcho specialties all tryna give us high cholesterol and diabetes cuz you know we crave your sweets: Sansrival and Brazo de Mercedes. Oh man... Get it away from us... No don't! Just kidding. No not kidding!

Gimmeeeeee nomnomnom"}
{"text":"I dropped in here for a little dessert after lunch.  They unfortunately did not have a slices of mango cake available. You have to buy the whole cake which is over $22 USD!

I did have a slice of their Rocky Road cake for $2.69 and a slice of banana cake for 99 cents.

Rock Road Cake was delicious!

Banana Cake was a bit dry.  They were individually wrapped and on the counter.  I wonder how long it was sitting for..."}
{"text":"If I want quality cake for decent price I come here. This place have good value meals that comes with a slice of cake. 

I always get their pack of mango bar, chocolate slice and banana slice. They used to be $1 but they raised their price since July 1,2015 but still worth it. The mango bar is a Filipino special but I can guarantee you it's yummy!"}
{"text":"If you are Filipino then you probably don't even need to read this review. Chances are you've already experienced these almost perfect pinoy pastries. Located in seafood city, which is pretty much a portal into Manila with the never ending swarm of Filipinos circulating throughout the building and occupying every parking spot within a 1000 yard radius, it's known for it's consistent quality of exotic goodies. Bringing  the always scrumptious light and fluffy mango cake to a potluck party will guarantee a winning contribution that will impress all your white friends lol. If you've never tried the decadent treats from the south east asian archipelago that brought you the nurse that treated your latest ailment    at the local hospital, you're really missing out on some exotic, buttery goodness and some really unique flavor profiles. When it comes to getting an authentic taste of the sweet side of Filipino culinary arts, this is the best Vegas has to offer. My personal favs: mango and mocha cakes, mamon, sans rival, and the empanadas. If your sweet tooth activates and you want to have something other then birthday cake or a candy bar, get your ass to the red ribbon at seafood city, where every Filipino person in Las Vegas is at right at this very moment. Just be ready to spend a lot of time finding a parking  space and being nuts to butts with us Filipinos."}
{"text":"For a Filipino franchise, this place is great. For a limited menu of Filipino comfort food, it is pretty good, but then again, it might be because I have limited access to Filipino food. If you get a combo of Arrozcaldo (chicken and rice porridge) or palabok combo (rice noodles with sauce) it comes with a slice of cake! Super affordable too!

Now it is also called a bake shop. Cakes are actually delivered from another location. I do recommend when you purchase a cake, ask for the most recent deliveries. I just learned that if the cakes are on sale for 20% off, it's because the cakes are close to 4 weeks old. However, don't let that deter you from purchasing a sheet. Just remember, a year old frozen wedding cake taste as great as it did on your wedding day. I've also learned that cakes that are 4 weeks old are just as good as the recent deliveries.

Depending where you're from, it's a rare occasion that you can get an ube (it's purple) mango or mocha cake.. And the cakes is so moist and not too sweet.

Cakes come in a loaf size that can feed 6 people, 9\" round and the largest is 1/4 sheet. Prices for cakes run between $14 to $25. So although you can go to a grocery store for a less expensive option, impress your family and friends with a delightful cake from Red Ribbon."}
{"text":"My son went to this bakery after I recommended this bakery because I had some of their cake from a coworkers birthday ! He said the service was very horrible. They told him the did not have any small cakes at all what so ever! Then after he paid for the cake went to pick it up he was told that he did not order a cake and had to show his receipt TWICE. Extremely bad service !!!! Very disappointed will not be returning obviously!!!"}
{"text":"I love Red Ribbon and I would seriously do ANYTHING to get another Midwest location besides Chicago. Cakes from Red Ribbon are always perfectly moist and consistently good and every Red Ribbon I've gone to always has super friendly employees. 

I actually stopped here to pick up pastries to bring back to Iowa as gifts for my friends. Unfortunately a mocha roll was probably not going to make it back in one piece so I picked up several packages of the mocha mamon instead which worked out perfectly and safely made it all the way to Des Moines as my carry-on item. Everyone I shared them with was really happy since it's hard to get Filipino baked goods here. 

Prices at Red Ribbon are great, and if you buy the prepacked pastries/cakes they even go on a reduced price if a product is within 2 days or so of its sell by date making them even more affordable! You're going to want to buy a lot anyway though."}
{"text":"If you love caramel and coffee, the coffee crunch is the best for you! A whole cake ranges from $15-20 no tax. They also have real food."}
{"text":"By far one of the best new experiences I had, coconut Ube cake, wow!! What a delicacy. Cant wait to go back for more"}
{"text":"I was craving empanadas so I stopped by to pick a couple up. Sure, it's a chain, but Red Ribbon is a good place to get some good Filipino cakes (mango, tres leche, ube, etc.), pastries, and of course, empanadas. I ordered one beef ($2.35) and one chicken ($1.94). Both had a thick and flaky pastry shell, with the beef empanada filled with a mixture of tender beef, carrots and peppers. The chicken empanada was a little dry and could have been more flavorful. The next time I stop by I'll have to stick with the beef, clearly the superior of the two."}
{"text":"I choice red ribbon to get my birthday cake this year. They have a wide variety of flavors to suit everyone's taste. My favorite is the mocha cake. I totally recommend the ube coconut cake. It is sooo divine. Dont forget to pick up some cheesy mamon or the creamy ensaimada when you stop by. I highly recommend this wonderful bakeshop to family and friends"}
{"text":"Oh my gosh -- why is there not a Red Ribbon near us? Why? We were on vacation in Vegas, and this was one of my first stops. Ordered a slice of sans rival. SOOO good! On a couple of other visits we ordered ube mamon (yum), palabok (was okay, but I'm not usually a fan of palabok), and empanadas. I prefer the chicken, but my hubby said he likes the beef better. Don't ignore the sign by the cashier of their different value meals. It's a pretty good deal. I believe it's palabok, plus a slice of cake, plus a drink for 6.99. Or if you want a smaller portion of palanbok, then you also get an empanada with the cake and drink for the same price. Not bad at all!!"}
{"text":"This bakery is amazing. I go in at least once a week. I always look forward to the variety of baked goods"}
{"text":"I love red ribbon....To an extent.

       I was born and raised on Goldilocks(if you do not know what this is given the fact its only in two states CA/NV i forgive you) so it is impossible to sway me from them to red ribbon that's just crazy talk. Red ribbon would have to change their whole way of doing things and add more to their menus and bakery selections.  I find it SEVERELY annoying that a chain Filipino restaurant such as this one to not carry ensymada rolls without ube or macapuno(coconut). I swear Arizona is making it impossible for me all my favorite things i have to order online or have shipped over by family in San Jose, CA. Disappointing and Pathetic if you ask me.  Arizona has a minimal but decent amount of Filipinos in the state...Why can't i find anything worth going to on a regular basis?!  
      Red ribbon has the better cakes so far that i can remember versus Goldilocks but i might be just basing it merely on the mousse cake i tried from red ribbon. I HATE regular cake except my red velvet cake or any of the cakes from nothing bundt cakes will work for me. Anyhow Red ribbon like i said has some Amazing chocolate mousse cake that is just to die for. That is the one thing i will recommend over and over.  I would rather have that on my birthday then a real birthday cake. But hey that is just me! i am not a fan of buttercream at all so does not excite me in the slightest.

Red ribbon managers please make me some ensyamadas with ube pretty please and send it over to the mills mall i would greatly appreciate it so i do not have to order a pack of 12 from Goldilocks for me to eat by myself! =["}
{"text":"You know when you know someone that works somewhere so you \"know the place\" but never go? That's not what's happening here. Sorta. I get to try their stuff ALL THE TIME (I won't reveal my sources), but if I've learned anything from tasting their goods.. I've learned that they need to revive UBE Cake.. AND push for some UBE ICE CREAM. Keep the purple alive."}
{"text":"On the second and third visit, I tried the lumpiang sariwa, the arroz caldo and the ensaymada.  I was struck in awe with the first bite. The lumpia wrapper with the sweet sauce was so good. The filling had only carrots, potatoes, and a leaf of lettuce only (sigh*) unlike the traditional lumpia  which had more ingredients (peanuts, singkamas etc.) .  

I would give a 3-star for that not-so-fresh lumpia and the filling, but the manager was so nice and sweet that I want to keep coming back --- and to add to it, their other dishes like dinuguan and the arroz caldo are delicious. They probably just made a mistake on the lumpia. And I haven't tried all their cakes yet.

I loved the arroz caldo even if it wasn't the traditional arroz caldo I know. Because they added mushrooms to it and I wasn't able to find saffron in it. But it was still good but not as good as what I am used to eating back home, in small food stands along the smoky and busy streets of Manila. 

Back home, the arroz caldo had no mushrooms or anything fancy, it had ox tripe, intestines, chicken, and saffron. I miss the streets food I'm used to =p I haven't tried the arroz caldo in Red Ribbon back home so I am unable to compare it to this one, sayang!

I loved the ensaymada...just like the ones I buy in local bakeries back home but better. I just love the taste of margarine because it tastes like home to me =) This was better than the one back home because they used Parmesan and cheddar cheese.

I am still coming back for more!!! I still haven't tried the sansrival here yet and the mango cake. =) I want the Ube shake next time too =)"}
{"text":"Was greeted right away while I was looking at their variety of goodies. Ordered a slice of Ube overload, Mango cake, butter mamon and a chicken empanada cuz Aubrey asked if I wanted one lol. She was always smiling! Very fast and efficient service. 

This place always has great goodies when you just need something sweet after eating at one of the delicious restaurant in Seafood City."}
{"text":"I was surprise to find a Red Ribbon in Arizona, but just like most Red Ribbon Bakeshop, the snack cakes are already wrapped up and does seem fresh to me.  It's still good, but I don't know why they can't be like a French Bakery and have most of the bake good out on display and not wrapped up.

Not much space at this location, just 6 tables, but plenty of seat at the food court."}
{"text":"Red Ribbon sells some bomb baked goods and desserts. The mocha mamon is one of my favorites, and so is the butter mamon.

If you buy the prepackaged pastries, they sell for a reduced price if the pastry is older than two days. Prices are really affordable. Writing this review and thinking about dessert makes me crave another dessert from Red Ribbon!"}
{"text":"I prefer Goldilocks more, but end up buying from here more often just because it's closer to my house and conveniently located inside Seafood City. I must say they do have the edge in their mango cake in comparison to Goldilocks. The cake and whipped topping is light while the mango is perfectly sweet, however all the other products I think are inferior to Goldilocks. In addition, the portion sizes here are more for like a family of 4 rather than Goldilocks which has bigger options. The bigger options are more ideal since these cakes and rolls are usually brought to Filipino parties. IMO even the ensaymada at Golidlocks is better because I prefer the texture of the pastry itself. Lastly Goldilocks puts together amazing children's cakes, I'm not to sure if Red Ribbon can compete with them there since they have significantly less displays. To add to all of this, better value at Golidlocks with better tasting cakes. If Goldilocks was in Seafood City they would probably do more business. Sorry Red Ribbon you're still the step child in my book."}
{"text":"We purchased a double chocolate roll and a mocha roll...they were very delicious!  They have a reputation of preparing tasty entrées as well....we'll come back for dinner."}
{"text":"There are a few Filipino restaurants here in the valley but this is the ONLY Red Ribbon in the state of Arizona. I've been to a few of these joints in Cali, Vegas, the Philippines... and I must say, for the size of this location and the limited menu its still a great place to eat at if you're craving pinoy food. Its located inside of AZ Mills Mall (not in the food court).

The baked goods are not fresh but the entries are. The palabok is on point! One of my faves. Its really hard to mess up palabok though. The deserts were ok."}
{"text":"Empanadas are so yummy! My favorite! I had the pork and chicken. Ordered one but should've ordered a dozen!"}
{"text":"I had cheesy mamon (sponge cake), pretty good, but the cheese sprinkled on top was an overkill. Next time I'll just order the plain ones. 

Halo-halo is a good summer treat but theirs is a bit too sweet and the mango preserves they put in it threw off the taste. Leche flan has consistency of creamy jello, this could be improved on. 
Otherwise, service is fast and place is clean and conveniently located beside Jollibee."}
{"text":"LOVE LOVE this place. This Red Ribbon is the only location I will go to. It is on the corner of Sahara and Fort Apache. It is a nice and quiet plaza. Inside the shop the staff does a great job keeping the place clean.  Jollibee is right next to the bake shop, which is nice because you can choose to get something from both shops! I love their Ube Overload cake, I got it for my birthday and it was so delicious! I also had merienda their with my mom. I tried their pancit and my mom tried their dinuuguan with the mango cake, it was a great. The food is clean and well made. Their mango cake is really yummy as well, I would definitely get the mango cake again the next time I go..along with the ube cake haha..I have no complaints about this place. 

The customer service is A+ the ladies that work there are so helpful. We wanted to get the ube cake around 3pm but they ran out so quickly (I suggest calling in to order or stop by in the morning to get the ube cake) so one of the ladies helped us order ube cake at the Seafood City location.  However, my mom and I decided to just wait the next day when they get their ube cake deliveries in the morning, since this location was much more convenient.  The lady that helped us was so patient with us. We loved it! Definitely the only Red Ribbon I go to in all of Las Vegas!!"}
{"text":"I always buy our favorite Mango cake! It's a staple in every party Since it's not too sweet. And some of their pastries, the cheesy ensaymada & mamon taste so good. The service is quiet good."}
{"text":"Love the area, lots of parking, movie theater in the complex, Jollibee and Red Ribbon sitting like an oasis in the dessert. Couldn't decide where to get the halo halo from so we chose the one with no line.  Service was good and quick unfortunately halo halo didn't blow me away.  The ice cream on top seemed like it had been in the freezer thawed and then refrozen too often. I've tried Goldilocks halo halo and that left me \"ooh and aawing\", this was mediocre.  I would come back for the bakery treats but not the halo halo."}
{"text":"I ordered the Arroz Caldo (Chicken/Shitiake Mushrooms/Green Onions in Congee)- it was very tasty.  My friend ordered the Palabok which was unfortunately not so great.  The cakes that I've tried are stupendously moist, light and flavorful.  Most pleasantly suprised."}
{"text":"I had heard of this bakery from a competitor who holds shop in Chandler.  I have fond memories of delicious cakes from Red Ribbon from birthday parties of years past back home.   Filipinos LOVE to throw a party, and I swear cakes from Red Ribbon were always present.  You can imagine the nostalgia that swept over me, then, when I finally found this bakeshop situated near the food court in Arizona Mills.

The shop looked so pretty- all lit up and all these enticing baked goods wrapped in plastic/cellophane with candy-red printing.  (Hmm... an alarm went off in my head after seeing them all wrapped up.)  The shop looked very clean, with welcoming tables and chairs, and my, how lovely those cake rolls look in the case!  Imagine, then, my disappointment upon reading the nutrition info on these plastic-wrapped goods to find that most, if not all, items are made with margarine, not butter.  These baked goods failed the \"farm vs. factory\" test- ingredients listed sound more like they're mechanically-produced in a factory rather than being all-natural, such as \"flour, eggs, butter, milk,\" etc.  Before sampling what I must admit was a delicious morsel of mocha crunch cake, I asked if the frosting contained powdered sugar.  The sales clerk looked at his coworker, whom I assumed is a manager, who looked at him, then looked at me, and then said \"We think it's whipped cream.\"  Think??  How can you not know what ingredients are used in the products you sell?  I also inquired if any items are made on-site.  No, he said.  Everything is shipped/trucked in, and the only preparations done at the bakeshop are the frying- the FRYING- of the empanadas and the re-heating of the siopao and noodle dishes.  

Sorry Red Ribbon, but this Filipina only wants goods baked with butter, not margarine.  I said BAKED, not fried.  With the exception of the pie shell used in the egg pie, all of the pastries served at Manila Bakery are made on-site, so you won't find preservatives listed in the ingredients, as well.  

My fond memories of those cakes will have to be just that, memories.  All the better when it comes to those twice-daily weigh-ins..."}
{"text":"I cannot say that I'm a fan because I can't eat most of the food here. Since most of their baked goods are shipped from somewhere else, I cannot bring myself to give them a higher rating than 3.

My mom likes to buy the ensaymada here, but it is made with margarine.

I found out why!

Margarine actually helps extend the shelf life of their product. Obviously it's found in cookies, crackers, and many \"manufactured\" packaged foods.

The employees were nice and sweet, though I did try their ube cake. It was edible, but I couldn't finish it since I'm on a diet."}
{"text":"Tasty small selection of Filipino food and Good variety of Filipino cakes and mamon (Filipino sponge cake). Red Ribbon is known for their variety of mamon and cakes. Their Forrest, ube, and mango cake are my favorites. I LOVE their mocha mamon, but there's also the butter mamon for starters.

They have a small selection of food, which is perfectly fine, but I will say that I come here specially for either the Arroz Caldo (chicken rice porridge....ask for lemon packets and fish sauce on the side because it is delicious with those!) or Pancit Palabok (Filipino noodle dish...look it up. Also, good with lemon). You can order those ala carte or as meals (I know a couple of options comes with your choice of empanada or slice of cake). You can order Palabok as a party tray as well, but just be sure to invite me.

I know there's two other Filipino restaurants next door to Red Ribbon that carry Palabok, but I really enjoy theirs. If you like thick noodles, look elsewhere though.

Their Arroz Caldo is delicious for a cool day or just to feed yourself after grocery shopping.

When you're done eating, don't forget to purchase a hug full of mamon for work, family, or friends. They taste so light and good!"}
{"text":"Their Mocha Mamon Sponge Cake is really good! It's not an overly sweet sponge cake which I enjoy a lot. The girl cashier working was nice. The place was also really organized."}
{"text":"Delicious unique cakes and pastries at a reasonable price. It's fun to browse through all the different sweets to pick out what you want. I got a ube mamon (purple yam sponge cake), a mango bar, and a slice of banana bread. Each was $1, tasted very fresh, with great flavor. Too bad there isn't a Red Ribbon in AZ anymore!"}
{"text":"Good service, limited selection of pastries compared to Valerio's. Looks like they specialize in cakes."}
{"text":"This is a review for their mango and ube cake. 

I don't know how I'll ever ... ever see cakes from Sams Club, Walmart, Albertsons etc.  the same way again. The first time I tried Red Ribbon cakes, I just melted. They've got a genuine taste to them that doesn't scream 'artificial ingredients!' like their more commercial counterparts. My father and I got my mom a mango cake for her birthday last month (it's $29 for an approximately 15x5 inch cake) and it was gone the next day.

It was that good."}
{"text":"bombbbb ! (: aroscaldo is so good, and their ube cake and mango cake are always great for any occassions"}
{"text":"We came in around 4:30pm on Christmas Day. I was actually surprised that they were open since Filipino places are usually closed on Christmas Day? Or maybe they're not, I'm not really sure lol. 

Anyway, we came in for desserts! They carry one of my favorites: brazo de mercedes. Super yummy! It's very light but full of flavor! We also got the mango supreme cake. I thought that cake was good too, but I like the Brazo one better. They have different kinds of desserts & they're all really delicious. The mamon they have is great for an afternoon snack! 

Their customer service was okay. They didn't really smile or anything but we didn't dine-in so I can't elaborate on that. Anyway, will definitely be back for the wonderful treats!"}
{"text":"is your favorite color - purple, and your favorite dessert - cake?  

well you can have them both and eat it too!

try their taro cake, but visit the ATM first."}
{"text":"Closed today.  I don't know for how long, maybe out of business?!"}
{"text":"Red Ribbon is a bake shop located right next to Jollibee. They have good Filipino style cakes. You can also buy by the slice which is ideal, if you want to try a variety of flavors. I used to not like buying by the slice as they tend to be hard on the ends. But they have now discovered what all other bake shops do, cover the side to keep it fresh.

This bake shop also serves a limited selection of Filipino food. My sister said they have good halo halo (mixed fruit with shaved ice) dessert. Something to try next time.

Been back a few times and the last two times, the soap dispenser is still broken. Restroom needs some attention."}
{"text":"I'll admit that I've never actually been inside of this place since its been there which has been a mistake. I've been bake in Vegas for a week and I've already been here 3 times. The empanadas are so cheap and so good, flakey and sweet. The best one is the pork, followed by the chicken, and then the beef (in my opinion). I tried the ube mamon, ube coconut cake, butter mamon, and the halo halo. I'm very picky about my halo halo, so I won't complain about it much. I just really didn't like the ice cream used on top, but that clearly doesn't affect my opinion of this place at all. The mamon and cake were very good. It was my first time trying the butter mamon and it tastes just like a pound cake! 

The ladies who have helped me here have been consistently nice and helpful. 

For a quick meal, snack, or something sweet; definitely recommend!"}
{"text":"I like Red Ribbon, a lot.  Their food is delicious.  Lasagna (though not your average lasagna), Palabak, and their Fresh Lumpia dishes are awesome.  

I won't describe them, because I make them seem less appetizing.  Their empanadas are AWESOME.  Chicken is the best, beef is decent.  UBE CAKE!  AHHHHH!  The ube cake...I love when they have it as their 'cake slice of the day'.  I haven't ventured to try anything else other than the ube cake, mostly because I don't like mango or coffee.  And if ube's on the list my mind is made.  It's purple, moist and delicious, always!  Ube shake is good, too.  I had the halo-halo once...it's interesting, for me.  I'll have to try it again to get a for sure decision on it but it's interesting."}
{"text":"The staff here is so polite! And I absolutely love their chicken empanadas. I was kind of obsessed with them. But know that I have discovered the rest of their menu. I've got to try it all!"}
{"text":"***YELP 100 CHALLENGE 97/100***

Between the popular Filipino bakery chains, Red Ribbon sits atop my list. Why you ask? Because its taste is consistently good across the board. Products are always fresh and service is superb every time. Whenever I visit any one of their stores, it always reminds me of the hospitality and friendliness Filipinos are known for.

Everything that I've tried from Red Ribbon from cakes and pastries to their mini snack offerings like Palabok and Arroz Caldo have been good. Among our favorites are their Chicken Empanadas, I have yet to find a better version anywhere in Las Vegas or LA. Perfect flaky buttery crust with an abundant chicken filling. The kids favorites are their butter Mamon and Cheesy Ensaimada. Of course they're famous for their Mango Cakes that's always a hit to bring to parties, Filipino and non Filipinos alike. It's very light and just the right amount of sweetness to let the true mango flavor shine thru. Recently they've introduced a new variation which is called Mango Supreme (starts at $20.99) that's even better than the original one, more prominent mango flavor. The prices are very affordable as well which is a big plus."}
{"text":"Cakes aren't overwhelmingly sweet. I love the mango cake and the black forest. All red ribbon shops are very consistent with their cakes. Whatever I ate in the Philippines tastes the same here in the US. From Cali to Vegas. I can testify to that."}
{"text":"Famous to Filipinos.  I love their Chicken Arroz Caldo, Chicken Enpanada & pretty much everything...Reminds me of HOME (Philippines)"}
{"text":"LOVE it here. This is the only bakery I know of where I can get cookies and cream Polvoron - Filipino cookie that crumbles and melts in your mouth.  YUM

I have my Fiance hooked on these things .. I should have bought more ;)"}
{"text":"Consistency...is when you go to any Red Ribbon location and you get the same quality and taste of food. Red Ribbon in Las Vegas, L.A. and Manila...they're all the same.

I like the cakes here especially mango, sans rival, chocolate mousse, choco mocha crunch and crema de fruta. Their desserts aren't extremely sweet which is unusual for Filipino desserts. A lot of Filipinos are diabetics. They use real fruits and the cakes are soft. They have the best mango cake ever. 

Their mamon is super soft and buttery good. If you like mangoes but don't want cake, the mango bars are great. Chewy and sweet bars with mangoes. They also have banana slice, brazo de Mercedes, mocha roll, ensaymada, empanada, siopao (steamed pork buns) which are pretty good.  I'm not a fan of ube...but I heard from reliable sources that their ube cake is delicious. Their palabok (noodles with sauce, pork, fried garlic, sliced hardboiled eggs and green onions) is yummy.  And what Filipino doesn't like pan de sal (warm and soft bread rolls)?

I'm sure there are so many new bakeries and cafes in Manila but for now, the best chain bakery that has reached this country/city is Red Ribbon. The other Filipino bakery is what my mom used to call \"poor man's bakery\"."}
{"text":"I'm not here to settle the debate between Red ribbon vs Goldilocks, but I must say 
their ube roll is outstanding. Wish they have a bakery in Chicago!"}
{"text":"I was recently went here for there mango cake since I have been craving for there mango cake. My coworkers had a birthday that week so I decided to buy them a mango cake to share at the office. I didn't know that they have recently change the way there mango cake look since they have added more mango puree with mango slices on the top. There is not much of a difference before but I felt like the mango bits were little bit sour for my liking but I still enjoyed eating the mango cake. The customer service overall was great."}
{"text":"I'm a big Goldilocks fan but it's across town so when I saw that Red Ribbon was adjacent to Jollibee I got excited.  Where else could I get pan de sal, mamon, and mocha cake.  Plus, they make cakes for special occasions and when you are in a jam and need a cake they are ready and waiting.  Great service and I didn't have to speak tagalog which I hate to do unless its my fam because everyone talks too fast!"}
{"text":"Butter Mamon is always a favorite!!! My kids gobble it up. I prefer the Ube Ensaymada. Lady working that helped us was great. Two thumbs up."}
{"text":"Fresh Lumpia, FTW!!!

It rivaled that of my aunts...and THAT says alot as she made the most amazing lumpia ever.  

I think that the sauce is one of the best parts about it...so this one was realllly good as it had just the right amount of garlic in it.  Very fresh ingredients, too!  Try it out!  

I also brought back a ton of ensymada and mamon.  The mocha mamon is really good!  Wish they sold that in Chicago!  Next time I hit up Red Ribbion, I'm definitely gonna try out the empanadas!  Sad I missed out!"}
{"text":"All red ribbon shops are basically the same layout.  Bread and packaged cakes open to purchase next to the refrigerated desserts section with mango and ube cakes and rolls calling your waistline to eat them. 

Red ribbon is always good and always a must stop for folks who don't have access to Filipino bakeries."}
{"text":"Purchased spoiled mamon bread one time and this location doesn't sell the signature Red Ribbon siopao aka pork buns. This location is so close to my house compared to driving to Seafood City, I am disappointed."}
{"text":"Stopped here after the Rebels game on 11/17/11 with my friend Wesley C. because he needed to buy a cake for his mom's friend because his mom forgot to pick it up. After walking over a mile from the Thomas and Mack to that shameful, bakery-less Vons on Trop. and then to my car parked at Freakin' Frog, I said let's get on down the road. He wanted to try out Albertson's but they didn't have a large enough cake. 

At 5 seconds to 10 PM, we ran into Red Ribbon and they told us they were closed. We ignored that and told them we needed to buy a cake. Wesley quickly picked out a chocolate cake, they wrote on it for us, and we each purchased some purple yam pastries. I got some sort of cake, he got a sweet roll. Now Wesley is totally not into any ethnic food, so he wasn't too pleased with the pastry and gave the leftovers to me - each item was just okay, not as good as the homemade stuff that I've had. I have no idea how the cake he purchased tasted but it sure was pretty!"}
{"text":"Just bought 2 Taisan Loaf we opened the second one after 2 days and the molds are internally spread throughout the cake."}
{"text":"Clean area, and bomb baked goodies. Ube mamon was on point tho! Everyone in there was super polite too..I'd definitely come back if I'm in the area."}
