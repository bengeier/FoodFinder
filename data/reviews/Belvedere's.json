{"text":"For a restaurant at a hotel. These guys are pretty damn good. 

Full hot buffet breakfast good hot stuff good cold stuff. 

Lunch dinner and bar menus are awesome with local Phoenix flavor. 

I don't leave reviews very often. These guys are awesome."}
{"text":"Burger was decent. Table service in the bar left an awful lot to be desired. Need dedicated servers in the bar."}
{"text":"Stayed inside the Hilton which is connected to the property. Came out for Breakfast three monrings, and waiters have a grouchy face the whole time. No Greeting, nothing, granted it's buffet, but a smile is nice. One morning, my husband and I got up to get some sugar for coffee, and noticed that the table had been cleared and another guests stuff was sitting on our table. Told the guy that and his answer was, \"go ahead and sit at the table next to it\" no apologies or nothing.

The potatoes at the breakfast were constantly running out. Why not making bigger batches? the coffee station was out of stirring sticks one day. 

The bf was so-so."}
{"text":"A typical hotel type restaurant with a fair selection. Ordered the roast chicken for dinner which was above average and quite tasty. I would eat here again but would hope that the service next time  (very polite though it may be) would be much better than what it was."}
{"text":"There was not even one vegetarian option on the menu aside from the fried macaroni bites appetizer. Not even a salad. This restaurant is in a Double Tree hotel and we are here for 4 nights. Sadly, we won't eat a single meal here. I gave them two stars because they gave us directions to an Indian restaurant down the street."}
{"text":"I ordered the Arizon guacamole burger with BBQ wings.   The wings were great and the burger was pretty good.  I would have liked it more if it were half the size though.  It was too big a burger for my tastes.  I ate in the bar\lounge area.  I had great service."}
{"text":"Came in for lunch. Place wasn't too busy, quiet, clean, and good service.

Coffee was above average for bottomless drip.

Split the achiote chicken flatbread and Mac and cheese with sweet potatoe waffle fries.

Flatbread was crispy, chicken was tasty, and came with a fresh salsa.

Mac and cheese was awesome and came in a cast iron. Generous amount of cheese which was wasn't bland at all.

Waffle fries were a nice pairing and the meal was filling for two.

Would come back!"}
{"text":"Good food and service.  Attached to Double Tree hotel where I am staying.  Free breakfast is better than you would think.  Steaks are pricey but very good.  This also is a real nice hotel to stay at.  Nice courtyard to relax on a beautiful evening."}
{"text":"Ate two meals here, the breakfast buffet and dinner, and was happy with both. The service was a little slow for dinner, but they were all very pleasant and gave us our own little room off the back of the restaurant so we could be loud without bothering people. Drinks were decent for a hotel place but cost a little bit of money. Yeah expense account! :)"}
{"text":"Not bad for hotel food!  The service was outstanding and the food was pretty good.  I loved their beer selection....Kilt Hiker.  A local microbrew..delish!!"}
{"text":"So mediocre. Had side salad out of a bag and some soggy mozzarella flatbread. Service is good though."}
{"text":"Didn't feel like driving anywhere so I came to the restaurant since I also had a free drink for any well or beer . The service was great and my burger was prepared well. I asked for my whiskey on the rocks since I don't drink it with crap and was charged .50$ for this ? Crazy I order this drink everywhere and never get charged at other hiltons"}
{"text":"Calm environment. I ordered the Loaded Mac n Cheese, it was delicious, a bit salty, but delicious.
Restaurant staff check up on a normal manner."}
{"text":"This restaurant sits inside the DoubleTree Hotel in Phoenix and since I was staying at this hotel I ate here three out of five nights.  First night I had a NY steak which was really good but a little pricey I thought given the venue.

The other two nights I had the 1/2 pound Angus burger smothered in bleu cheese crumbles.  This is only $10 and is worth every penny.  Normally served with french fries or coleslaw you can also substitute their cheddar mashed potatoes or grilled vegetables. The mashed potatoes are really good.

Several flat-screen TVs surround the bar area (I ate in the bar but there is regular restaurant-style seating available). These TVs were quite predictably tuned into various sporting events, which was fine with me since football season is back in full swing.  

Not a lot more to report on this place except to say that a colleague of mine ate here one night as well and said \"That was the best chicken sandwich I've ever eaten.\"    NOTE: He did request BBQ sauce which is not standard so to experience what he did... I say get some BBQ sauce too.

If you are going to be staying in Phoenix I highly recommend the DoubleTree (http://www.yelp.com/biz/doubletree-hotel-phoenix). Its clean. Its comfortable... and it includes a complimentary buffet breakfast at Belvedere Bar & Grill each morning.  This is not your normal continental breakfast of coffee, juice and sticky buns in plastic wrappers... No... This is coffee, juice, scrambled eggs, bacon, sausage, fresh fruit,and assorted baked goodies like cinnamon rolls, biscuits and bread for toasting.  I think they even had pancakes and/or waffles a couple days but since I am trying to stay low-carb I wasn't looking too closely at the baked goods, etc.

I don't imagine too many people would think to eat at Belvedere Bar & Grill unless they are staying at the DoubleTree but I gotta tell you... this place was really very good and even if you are staying somewhere else, I suggest that if you want a really good burger, check out Belvedere."}
{"text":"Used Yelp to locate a place to connect with two friends staying near the airport. Pressed for time and not really familiar with what's in the immediate area, so decided to hook up here. The Doubletree - place has to be good, right?

Wrong! This place is an embarrassment to the Doubletree/Hilton brand. It does have the exorbitant pricing you'd expect (when I walked in my buds were waiting and first comment I heard was - you wanna order one of the $5 Ice Tea's? lol). But it is in a state of disrepair and needs a serious facelift. I couldn't justify paying the prices shown on the menu. That coupled with the price we forked out for a few beers had us QUICKLY looking for another  place.

This was one of those RARE occasions that Yelpers left me hangin..."}
{"text":"Excellent in hotel restaurant, not trying to be anything more. Greeted, seated and waited on in a friendly efficient manner. Food was tasty and well prepared. Priced reasonably to be the hotel restaurant. We thought we received value."}
{"text":"Pretty decent for a restaurant in a hotel. Mainly just American food: sandwiches, some fish entrees, sides of potatoes and veggies etc. I liked the waiter, he could hold his own in a conversation and was pretty witty. He seemed quite confident and he kept my water full. 
The food was good, not exceptional, but certainly not bad. The baked tilapia with spinach and mushrooms was tasty and cooked just right (i.e. not dry). The bread and butter the waiter brought out for us before our meal was delicious! I've never eaten so much bread in my life. I felt quite satisfied when I left and the cookie I got on the way out the door was a nice way to finish the night."}
{"text":"Just enjoyed a nice and quiet lunch. The restaurant and bar area were not at all busy as it was early lunch time on a weekend. The lunch menu isn't long but the choices looked appealing in every section offered. I decided to go with the Crispy Buffalo Shrimp Tacos and they were well worth the $13. You get three large tacos that are presented nicely as they are full of fresh toppings and flavor. The \"buffalo\" sauce on the shrimp has some good heat to it without loosing the flavor. The side of salsa and chips that come with them was a nice add and the salsa tasted fresh and had a hint of smokiness to it. The most impressive part of lunch was the great service and quick attention we received. The food was brought out hot and fresh and our drinks barely got a third of the way before it was topped off. 
I'd recommend anyone staying in the hotel to eat here. The lack of the two stars merely comes from knowing there are plenty other food options available if you are willing to go look for them but the convenience of this is key if you need something quick and relaxing near your room."}
{"text":"Solid 3 star....this place is located in the Double Tree Hotel. It is typical bar food with some better food options as well but everything for me here is just middle of the road, but if you are staying here and don't feel like driving anywhere then it's for sure a good option. My personal favorite here is their salmon it is actually a pretty good dish and I have found that if you ask them to cook it a certain way the chefs in the kitchen will honor that pretty well. They also have a great relaxing atmosphere were you can relax with coworkers and friends and catch your favorite game and unwind after work. Great option after a long day and you just feel like chilling out and not figuring out where to go to dinner."}
{"text":"Not bad for a hotel restaurant.  Had breakfast here while staying in Phoenix, and although the selection is rather simple, the quality is decent.  The fruit is the best part of their breakfast buffet-- they are constantly swapping out fruit containers as they empty and bringing out other types of fruit, so keep visiting if what you see the first time doesn't suit you.  The bacon isn't crispy, but the flavor is okay, and the eggs are decent.  Service is fair, and breakfast is complimentary with your stay."}
{"text":"As I have mentioned in many reviews, customer service and product knowledge go a long way with my wife and me.

Unfortunately, this place tarnishes a pretty nice brand and does not live up to the Doubletree/Hilton minimum standards for customer service. 

Strike one came when our server (Bryan) did not know the non-alcoholic drink selection. My wife asked about that because there is nothing written the menu listing those kinds of drinks. 

Strike two came when she wanted to ask a question. Before she could ask, he actually turned away from her. We both looked at each other with a \"WTF?!?\" Expression on our faces.

Strike three was the icing on the proverbial cake. When we got our bill, we saw a charge of $1.00 for grilled onions. On top of that, our bill did not reflect what was ordered. Instead of saying \"Blue Cheese & Bacon\", it said \"Angus Burger\" with an additional charge for bacon. After relaying our concerns to him regarding the extra charges, he gets the manager. This is when the fireworks start.....

a) I have worked in the restaurant industry and been to four and five star restaurants in my life. But I NEVER met someone so condescending as Ms. Hansen. When my wife relayed her concerns about the drinks not appearing on the menu, she basically told my wife, \"We can put what we want on our menus!\"

b) When my wife relayed her concerns about what was on the ticket, Ms. Hansen gave the same answer as the server (We had to do it this way so the chefs wouldn't be confused). The BS flag was waving proudly at this point.

c) Very few things could make my wife snap but this manager's condescending tone accomplished the feat quickly. She kept pushing my wife to get her card to pay for the meal which exacerbated the situation. After a terse exchange, the manager decided not to charge us for the meal (first thing she did right).

Bear in mind, this is a place that my wife likes to eat lunch at while out and about. Because of the experience we had this evening, wifey is never coming back."}
{"text":"We were pleasantly surprised with the dinner menu.  Good selection of entrees and didn't hurt the pocketbook.  No gouging here.  Good service.  

We ate here twice over our two night stay.  The hotel shuttle could have driven us to one of several close by restaurants but it was too darn hot.  Even in the evening.  Over 95f in dry desert heat.

The daily comp breakfast buffet was also served in the Belvedere."}
{"text":"Complimentary breakfast buffet! Change it up, and get a plastic to-go plate, go to the outdoor seating in the courtyard and enjoy your fountain and pool side break fast! Quiet, Zen."}
