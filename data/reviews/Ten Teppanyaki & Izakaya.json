{"text":"We just had a wonderful dinner at Ten ! The service was wonderful and the portions were very generous. We couldn't finish our dinner!!! The staff go out of their way to make it a great experience. I would recommend this place to anyone who loves Japanese Tepenyaki !!"}
{"text":"Had multiple good meals here, the kids love it. To be honest I do too. The food is very good. The service is great. Always puts you in a festive mood. For 30$ per adult you have plenty food and it's delicious. Not sure what other reviews mention about being overpriced, but a meal at McDonald's is 10$-13$ nowadays, so let's keep that in mind. This is not McDonald's. We always do the mignon with tiger shrimps and extra shrimps. Love shrimps. They have a kids menu, the chef whips out some teriyaki chicken for the kids they love it. My wife is celiac and they make her food separate with GF sauces. Thanks guys, keep up the good work!"}
{"text":"Nice cozy place good for a group of 8 to share a live Teppanyaki station but they can do better on the entertainment side especially with their Cheff acrobatics"}
{"text":"The staff was very courteous and quick. However the food is sub par. It's ordinary meat, chicken, rice just with a little show. In my honest opinion the plates are very overpriced. 30$ for a plate filled with chicken, meat and vegetables. It's just not what you would expect. The show was fun though but latested only 10min since we were only two at a table of 10."}
