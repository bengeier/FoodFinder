{"text":"My problem with this place is that the salad serving size is the size of a small side salad, not at all an entree size.  However the pricing is the Entree pricing.  This is the 2nd time and last time I order here.  I ordered a Cali Cobb Salad, and while it tastes very good, paying $8.79 for a side salad and still being hungry when lunch is over is ridiculous.    They do give you a hunk of bread and a chocolate strawberry, but if you're ordering a salad instead of a sandwich you are probably watching calories and can't eat the CHOCOLATE strawberry or the hunk of bread.     So the whole thing is very disappointing, and now I'm wondering what I'm going to have for lunch now that I finished this expensive tiny salad."}
{"text":"This place is just awesome! Try the Wisconsin Cauliflower soup you will not be disappointed. The sandwiches and salads are fresh and tasty. This spot is the place to be on a cold n rainy day."}
{"text":"The good: good quality food. Portions are smaller than other places but very reasonable.   The bad: line up to order is awkward, you order up front from someone behind a Subway/Chipotle style bar but only for Salads, so if you order a sandwich you see nothing being done and eventually your sandwich appears somewhere down the line.  Place was kind of smelly and staff seemed more self involved."}
{"text":"Super nice service, delicious food, fresh ingredients.  Doesn't get any better than that.  The sandwiches are a bit on the small side but it gets the job done and fills you up pretty good, especially if you get their combo - two of a full size sandwich, half soup or half salad."}
{"text":"Staff is very friendly and helpful. My mom is very picky with food and they let her taste the salad dressings and was very patient with her order. I love their Chicken Tortilla soup and their salads are all fresh and flavorful, I wish they would open some in Southern California. I will continue to stop by any time I'm in phoenix."}
{"text":"The set up was cool here! Very bright and energetic. The employees are nice.   I ordered a chicken chop salad and the chicken enchilada soup combo. It was fresh.  I also tried my friends lobster soup. It was too fishy for me.  This place was not bad but it was not the best. I have had better."}
{"text":"The salad and soup were very well done only to be bested by the friendliness and enthusiasm of the staff!  The meal was topped off by an amazing chocolate covered strawberry.  If the competition is Paradise, I think they have edged them out slightly!"}
{"text":"We love this place! The food is always so fresh! Everything we've tried has been delicious. The portions are large - enough to split...tho we usually can't just decide on 2 things. We also usually have dessert bc the Carmel custard is to die for. Kids meals portions are good for the money also. They also have a bunch of flavored syrups for sodas. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Very Fresh, and good atmosphere. However the girl we dealt with behind the counter was neither fresh nor very good with patrons.  We decided to build our own Salads and instead of just advising us that the price would increase with more than the four standard ingredients, she chose to tell us that we couldn't add them, trying to hold us to the four ingredients.  A build your own salad should be just that, \"Build your Own\", or at least allow you to have it built your way.  When all was said and done, the salads were tasty and fresh, and my son's sandwich was good as well.  Hopefully when, or if, we return we don't have to deal with that gal again.  The prices are fair.    This sentence is from my 6 year old son.  he wanted to say something as well.  it was a very good time."}
{"text":"Awesome food I had the 2 combo for like 8.50 give or take a few ,I got a whole crab and avocado melt really good ,and a half chicken Cobb salad to much for me .Shared it with the wife ,awesome service friendly staff help you pick out food and the desserts looks good ,and you get a chocolate coverd strawberry and they have a 3.99 kids meal awesome place good food."}
{"text":"Great concept, great service, great soups and salads but was not impressed with the sandwich my wife got.  Everything is pre-done to make things roll quickly.  It is a Chipotle style restaurant that you order as you go down the line and pay at the end.  The variety was awesome but the sandwich was a little soggy by the time we got to eat it.  The place is large and super casual but very bright and lots of fun for the kids too.  Will come back for sure to try more soups and salads."}
{"text":"If your in the mood for great soup and sandwiches and desserts that are as good as any I have ever had, then your in luck. Cafe Zupas won't let you down. Give them a try. They are super friendly despite being opening week."}
{"text":"Over-priced, but super friendly staff, great quality food, very fast for the quality as well, and great selections! Kind of lame you can tip the ones cleaning your table, but for how much they program the people to up-sale and get every last penny out of everything, I can see why they don't want you tipping.  Aside from the closed on sunday and weird corporate feel of the place, love to get a good salad and soup in 2 minutes!"}
{"text":"Great fresh food at a reasonable price! Lots of healthy options. Similar to a paradise bakery"}

{"text":"This is probably my go-to and favorite fast food/ restaurant in the valley. When we have friends and family visiting we always make sure they never leave AZ without trying Zupas' salads and sandwiches.  Our personal favorite: Protein Cobb Salad, Strawberry Chicken Harvest, Mango Berry Salad. We also love their grilled cheese sandwich, all avocado based sandwiches and the honey bacon sandwich. For every try 2 combo we also order a small soup to share and their Lobster Bisque is match made in heaven! I also love their variety of water and fruit mixes/ juices.   Service in this branch is incredible, they may have left our salad's dressing one time when we had a to go order but never happened since then and we noticed they had new staff which are great!   P.S. We haven't tried their million dollar cookie/ brownies and their parfaits but they always look so good on the counter.   Zupas is like a weekly thing, I really recommend everyone to try them!"}
{"text":"I have been going to this place since it has opened, I have never has the worst service like I had yesterday. In working in a busy location this spot is always great to get fresh fast food however yesterday we did a pick up order and they did not put everything properly in the trays. I called about the missing items and talked to a \"manager\" Kristina who appeared to be a manager in training because she keep putting me on hold. Ten mins later she disconnected the call I had to call back and she failed to resolve my issue which lead me to return my food. When I did the manager who helped me on the phone went to the back and was laughing at the situation with other associates while another Mgr helped me. Worst rude service ever, will not recommended this place to any one anymore. When I asked for the Corp number I was also told I could not have it they are not allowed to give it out, and was told I had to call back to talk to the gm if I wanted to talk about the situation further."}
{"text":"Jury still out. I need another visit.  Hard to describe the place. Bright well decorated. Probably not correct but to me I would call it trendy.  What it reminded me of was the old cafeterias. Go in order what you want as you walk along. Drink vending is in an awkward place and causes you to have to look to find. What reminded me most of the old cafeterias is the noise level. Very loud. You have to talk loud for the people at your table to hear you talk. The food was good and the price was a little high for the quantity of food you receive.  Oh! you do get a chocolate covered strawberry with your meal.  This is another place for me to visit again."}
