{"text":"Hidden gem in downtown Brampton.  First time visiting and we will be back. Good goulash, great atmosphere..unique decor..and lovely staff. Be warned that is is a small place so if you get there a bit later you may not get a table. Love this place and will return!"}
{"text":"Absolutely Delicious!!! I eat here weekly, I can't get enough of these homemade fresh eats!!

The owners are friendly and welcoming.. And their chef takes true pride in his food.

Pirogies and the bake potato soup are to die for!!"}
{"text":"This restaurant is something different from the everyday place.  It's influenced by Eastern European food and everything is made from scratch.  On a Thursday evening it wasn't very busy.  It's very close to Rose Theatre so it was a great place to grab a bite before going to the theatre.  I tried the goulash and my friend had the perogies. The goulash plate was very filling and is a lot of food.  It was tasty and I enjoyed it.  The menu description could have been better.  The plate comes with beet salad coleslaw and cornbread. I am not a fan of cornbread and I hate beets.  I would have preferred more coleslaw instead.  The cornbread was a bit dry in my opinion.... But I am also not an expert.  I would recommend this place.  Especially if you feel for a good home cooked type of meal."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere.  Fun cozy down to earth, feel like your on a holiday type place. Great for after work drink and more. The owner is supper friendly and knows regular customers by name. She went out if her way to look into something for me that was none business related. I ordered two meals to go...cabbage rolls and a stew. Both were tasty. This was my first visit..I'll be going back to dine in. Can't wait to try the progies:)"}
{"text":"A must see/try if you are in the Brampton downtown area. Homemade delicious food. Friendly staff. And a cozy decor. Since the new year they have upgraded the seating area and now have a liquor license! I've had just about everything on the menu and its all very good. I do recommend trying the pierogi's the first time. If you aren't into pierogi's you can't go wrong with the other items on the menu."}
{"text":"Small but very nice what really matters is the food. And it will not disappoint you very good home made style food."}
{"text":"Although they've been operating at the farmers market for some time, this is a new business to the downtown core.  As a residence of the area, my wife and I make frequent walks downtown and enjoy seeing new and trendy businesses opening their doors.  For the few times we've been there already, the owners and staff have been friendly and helpful.  The coffee is better than the other 2 coffee shops around the corner and the cinnamon buns are delicious.  I would definitely recommend the Queen Gypsy to others as this is my new downtown cafe of choice."}
{"text":"Best European cuisine with unforgettable service. The pirogies are my favourite in the country and the desserts and Turkish coffee will have you coming back for more. I took some strudel home and warmed it up, served it with vanilla ice cream. The guests loved it!"}
{"text":"Hey Brampton, have you been downtown recently? Well if not, you should because there are some AMAZING businesses popping up down there that you need to check out ASAP. 

You heard it here first: Queen Gipsy is THE cafe you need to try out.

Found this place while walking the street and when I entered I knew it was something special. It's decorated with a a gypsy elegance and a little flair. I liked it.

I wasn't able to try their coffee (I was already 2 in that day) but I did have a green tea and a sausage roll. Sausage rolls are my weakness, but then again when I found out that all their baked goods are made fresh and in house, everything became my weakness. 

I saw their massive sticky buns and their cinnamon bunz and my knees went weak! This is definitely on my food bucketlist for the next time in around - diet be damned! 

Eatcrest Out!"}
{"text":"Small and intimate restaurant in downtown Brampton.    Bruschetta for $9 had four pieces on a plate.....overpriced and so-so.    Pork schnitzel with sauerkraut and onions and coleslaw with pita bread slices for $12 was decent (breading seperated from meat).   Perogies dish with coleslaw and pita bread was $10 and tasty.     Gypsy stew was really good for $12.    Notice anything?    No cornbread as per the menu.....pita bread instead...... Explanation was that they only make one loaf of cornbread per day to serve all customers....then they serve pita bread until close.    Asked for baklava on dessert menu.....didnt have it.   Alcohol prices are very high....guess this is where they make up for cheaper main dish prices.    Service is excellent from one server for the whole restaurant..... Always checking in and making guests feel comfortable.     Would recommend as a quick dinner and drinks but not as a repeat restaurant.....there were many regulars on a friday night when we went there and they seemed to have a great time.    Atmosphere is excellent....wall decorations, music, and 3 tvs with CP24 showing."}
{"text":"Hanging out with my fiancé and some friends! A customer recommended the pirogies, and holy damn they are to die for!!! We all had them, and my fiancé even had two servings! Arrive was fast and not only friendly but also funny. We will definitely be back soon!Thanks so much QG xo"}
{"text":"I love the home-made style food, the warmth of the owner, and the charming atmosphere. I would have given this five stars because of how comfy and delightful it is, but the service has been quite slow both times I visited. I will definitely be back, but not when I am in a big hurry."}
{"text":"What a find in Downtown Brampton! 

I met up with a friend on a Tuesday nite to finally check this place out and only wished I had much sooner!

I was greeted immediately and was allowed to choose my table. It was a visual adventure with all sorts of nik naks to discover scattered through out the place. 

Our server was super friendly and informative. I was shocked that she had only been there a few weeks as she was so familiar with the menu and extremely helpful. 

We ordered hummus to start. Pitas were fresh and hummus silky smooth. 

We chose 2 entrees to share- perogies and pork schnitzel. Wow. We were informed that all items were made from scratch, in house which was obvious from the tenderness of both dishes. Perogies were perfectly done and although the schnitzel was a bit thicker than I'm used to was incredibly tender. 

I was so stuffed but couldn't resist the blueberry desert perogies. Totally worth the extra calories! 

I would recommend this place to everyone and will definately be back!"}
{"text":"Brampton, and downtown Brampton in particular, really needed this place and I really hope they're around a long time. A great coffee shop/bistro and even bakery as they bake their own goods - including full loaves of artisan bread. Their food is Central/Eastern European based and make their own Goulash, Schnitzel, stuffed peppers etc... They also offer you standard (but good) sandwiches and possibly Paninis. I know many (including myself) complain that Brampton doesn't offer enough locally-run, 'cool', high quality places. So check these guys out and support them - I'm sure you'll enjoy it.

On another note: they plan to be open for dinner when they get their liquor license which is apparently a month or two away. Good for me since I'm generally out of the area at work most times they're presently open."}
{"text":"Love love  love this place!!!
Love The people... The food 
The conversation 
Ambience is outstandingly warm and hospitable !!!

I can't wait to go back to this restaurant and I've heard the menu has recently been changed to include some of my favorites. I'm coming back to look out"}
{"text":"Its three for three great meals on my visits to the restaurant! It has to be the most unique restaurant I have ever visited in Brampton from its decor. Very friendly environment as the owner and staff make you feel like you are visiting a friend's home. Their twists on Central European dishes brings something different to the cuisine. Definitely more like comfort food. If the Apple Stoodle is there, DO NOT LEAVE WITHOUT EATING DESERT!"}
{"text":"A great place for coffee, baked goods and savory meals. Liquor license coming soon. Good eastern European style food like cabbage rolls and schnitzel with other offerings like panini sandwiches, and tacos.
A funky decors makes it a cool hangout."}
{"text":"I'd be lying if I said I didn't find this place in a drunken stupor but that does not take any value out of the following review!

Downtown Brampton has something that is cool and original. I didn't know if I would ever say that.

The décor is amazing. The whole concept seemed so fresh and modern and yet inviting; I can't say enough good things. The service was really friendly. The food is almost unreasonably inexpensive. 

And the offerings are different enough that I want to try everything on the menu. How bold is it to serve beets with so many menu items? Bold but awesome because beets are dope.

Even as I'm writing this review I am mad at myself for not coming here since the last time I came here. GO NOW. Support this place Brampton. Seriously."}
{"text":"What a great experience! 
We were trying to figure out what the options were for Taste of Brampton and Queen Gypsy's looked like the best deal - one appetizer or small salad, one main and dessert for 20.00. We called about 20 minutes before heading there and the woman that answered was super helpful answering questions about vegetarian options and she reserved her last empty table of two for us.
They were easy to find right near Brampton city hall but the parking can be a bit tricky on a busy Friday night. The restaurant is small but really cute inside. Gypsy chic we will call it! 
The menu has a nice array of options (mostly meat driven but that's to be expected) and it's not too big which I actually like because in most circumstances that means they do what they do well. For my appetizer I got the roasted red peppers, main - eggplant and zucchini panini, dessert - blueberry perogies. The roasted red peppers were amazing! I have never had something like that before. They are skinned, seasoned and in oil and vinegar, they were perfectly tender, I need to do this at home. The sandwich was super delicious - I got it without cheese (which would probably make it even more amazing lol). The bread was super crunchy and the veggies were perfectly cooked inside. The panini came with beets and slaw both were really good. The dessert Omg, I would say maybe it was so good because it was cheating on the no dairy (btw I am failing at least once a week at this lol) but these were spectacular!!! They were kind of chewy (in a good way) not overly sweet, the sweet came from the custard they sat in. 
My boyfriend got the Bruschetta which was done with roasted peppers as well and feta, the bread looked great and super crunchy. He confirmed that it was delicious and I could tell by how quick they went! For his main the gypsy stew which came with rice, corn bread, slaw and beets. He ate the whole thing and confirmed it was great, he also got the blueberry perogies and feels the same as me! 
This experience reminded me of what it would be like to go to a Serbian friends house and having an amazing home cooked meal. Seriously that sounds awesome? Highly recommend."}
{"text":"What a hidden gem in Brampton!  Make reservations as there are only a handful of tables. Dont come in a rush- food is all cooked from scratch so it does take a while. Id rather my food take long than fast and feel like it was just sitting there for reheating 
Only thing i can say is the food is a little heavy- come for a delicious comfort meal
Will be returning :)"}
{"text":"Great ambiance. The stuffed red peppers were amazing! The staff is friendly and the music is at a perfect volume. Pub like atmosphere with a little bit of funky appeal. Great date spot!"}
{"text":"Another great experience at the coziest restaurant in Brampton. Apart from the convenient location, ( indoor parking at city hall on a snowy evening) this is a warm and welcoming space with big servings of delicious soul food with an Eastern European twist. I could not resist the Gypsy stew again. It was just as good as I remembered. At $12 with all the fixings, cornbread, coleslaw salad, beets, cheese and very tasty, it's a great bargain, eye catching and very colourful. 
I asked for hot sauce, it happens that they make their own! It was very tasty. Found out after on the website that they sell hot sauce! Would have bought one if I knew. My dinner mate had the pirogies. They were $10 with all the fixings. I tried one. It just melts in your mouth. Definitely a must try! Very delicious. We shared a blueberry pirogi plate for dessert. Delicious, not too sweet and the sauce it comes with is subtly cheesy. The drink choices are perfect, wines and beer. We went for the non alcoholic grapefruit and orange sodas which went down quickly. 
Some perfect looking breads were put out in the bar for sale about halfway through dinner. Braided egg bread, Chelsea buns, current rolls. Some tables before us had left with loaves of bread. 
The service was warm and welcoming. The atmosphere is easy going and relaxed. The decor is bohemian ranch, which I personally love. There is a bar with 5 or 6 chairs, pub tables and 2 tables for 2. I was privileged to get one of the tables for 2. This restaurant is tiny, but definitely makes the most of the space. 
Ticks all the boxes for a great evening out in Brampton. This was my friend's first time here and she will be back soon and spread the word. How could this little treasure be so unknown by the masses? Hope I can still get a table when this gets out!"}
{"text":"Looking for a Slavic place, I decided to search online and found this amazing Serbian restaurant. There are many amazing dishes here. I would especially recommend the Goulash and the cabbage rolls. The owner and the assistants are really friendly people, and the atmosphere is interesting. 5/5 rating, come to this place, you will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"I knew it was going to be a good night when I entered this little cafe/bistro/best place in Brampton! I encourage anyone and everyone to skip The Works and all of the other more popular places in downtown Brampton and try Queen Gypsy! Why, you ask? Well, to start with the staff are amazing, friendly and very personal, the owner stopped at our table throughout the night to chat with us, offered some secret menu options..pst. Blueberry pierogis are a thing and you can find them here!
I ordered the goulash, a corona and my girlfriends and I shared a plate of their pierogis... The cafe itself is so sweet, full of DIY art and decor, when the food comes it is just like you're at home or a friends house, I swear I almost said \"thanks Mom\", when the waitress brought my dinner; it is THAT comfortable. Anyways, back to the food, this is heaven on a plate, we were all \"mmmmm\" and \"yummmm\" throughout the night. The pierogis are great, they are so different; smothered in alfredo and filled with cheese, deepfried on both sides, delicious! The goulash is so homemade it will make you smile as soon as you put the fork in your mouth, it is a rich stew with beef and carrots served on a bed of rice, with a side of salad and cornbread. 
I am beyond grateful for the hospitality of Queen Gypsy, this is just the place to be when in Brampton! All of this and the bill cost under twenty dollars for each of us! Woo hoo!
Just a friendly tip: It is a small area, I am not sure how many tables are in the place or if they can accommodate large groups."}
{"text":"Chef's night off?

I really wanted to like this place - absolutely LOVED the atmosphere and the girl working here - but what I ordered was dreadful.  Friend's dish (Gypsy Stew) was better, but both came with undercooked rice, a no-no for Asians.  

(Not sure why people continue to cook rice with anything other than a rice cooker!?!  They're not that expensive and it takes the guessing game out of the equation.)

I ordered the Goulash and I've had it a couple of other times at Polish/German places, but never at a Serbian restaurant, so maybe it's just \"different\", but it did not taste good.  The Goulash here was really dark, espresso brown in colour and sour.  Tbh, it initially tasted 'off' to me.  Chunks of beef were half grisly, all overcooked, dry, & tasteless.  Barely any sauce, whereas the other goulashes that I have tasted before come with a lighter brown sauce that is basically a gravy.

Again, I'm not sure what it's supposed to taste like, but I don't think it's supposed to be sour.  Meat for sure is not supposed to taste like that.  This much I know.

Friend's Gypsy Stew was much better, spicy - be warned, but again, rice that came with it was undercooked.  Salads that accompanied both dishes were delightful, especially the coleslaw!  No complaints there.  Didn't see any baked goods."}
{"text":"I did what I normally do and make decisions based off reviews. This place was delicious and hand crafted. Everything was fresh and the service was very personable! I had the perogies and gypsy stew, I'd highly recommend both! The perogies were so soft and rich, just melting in your mouth. The stew was extremely flavorful and filling. I wish I had a place like this in Baltimore."}
