{"text":"We came here for dinner and the service was outstanding and the food was just excellent.  This restaurant is a hidden gem!"}
{"text":"Llega con hambre y pide la hamburguesa, carne deliciosa pero grande la porción. El filete mignon es una muy buena opción también. 

Come hungry and ask for the hamburger, great and juicy meat but quite big. Filet mignon is a great option too."}
{"text":"This restaurant is excellent! (Diner June 6th 2015)
The menu is elegant and well researched.
The service is great and desert...I will have to come back to try them all!
In Summary I loved it and I support all the other great comments."}
{"text":"Great food and service. Went on a Monday night, and it was quite slow. I'm surprised, because if I lived in the area, I would likely go often. Few too many have discovered this restaurant. I would recommend giving this place a try. I got the grilled salmon and it was cooked and seasoned well. Although, my partner said their risotto with shrimp and scallops had too much butter and salt. Either way, great atmosphere and service."}
{"text":"Convivial, excellent service and unique dishes"}
{"text":"I would come back again. The ambience is nice - suitable for larger groups or dates. My friend and I ordered the duck confit and lamb shank.  We both enjoyed our mains. For desert, my friend ordered me the orange cheesecake as it was my birthday, and the waiter brought out two cheesecakes (one on the house): one with a candle on it and he sang me a happy birthday song :) Really accommodating and pleasant staff."}
{"text":"I came here on a weekday for lunch after reading all the glowing reviews. The lunch menu is rather limited. I had a taste of the squash ginger soup, beef carpaccio, and smoked cheddar burger. I ordered the pasta special, a fettuccini with spicy tomato and fresh herbs. The beef carpaccio was delicious: tender, melt-in-your-mouth meat with a zesty blend of dressings. Burger was average as was the soup. 

So why did I give this restaurant one star? Because the service was terrible. Not only was it incredibly slow, but the waiter was pompous and not attentive. Water glasses were not filled. When he brought my pasta over, it was pretty cold - okay I can deal with that. But it was SUPER SALTY to the point that I spat it out almost immediately! When I asked him for a new one, the waiter looked very annoyed and said it would take a while. No problem I said, I could wait. Some time later, a new one was brought out - this time, ZERO SALT. Not sure if the chef was confused that day or what, but the pasta and service turned me off of this place forever. A final note: this place is way overpriced. Save your money, go elsewhere in Toronto."}
{"text":"Food and staff here are amazing. Would go back and would also recommend to anyone. We had the cornish hen and the burger. Both were incredible."}
{"text":"Amazing service, amazing food, amazing atmosphere. Love it! A must come!! Really love how they give you a palette cleanser between the appetizer and main courses, so thoughtful!!"}
{"text":"The Elm Tree Restaurant offers high quality food and lovely service, without the pretension or usual annoying crowd. It was one of the best meals I've had in a while. 
My friend and I shared the roasted beets (with goat cheese, beet purée and garlic chips) and arugula mushroom salad to start. Both were flavourful and fresh. We then both had the duck confit risotto as our mains. Again, flavourful, fresh and overall really enjoyable. If there was one criticism, it would be that the risotto wasn't put on hot plates, so they were just warm by the time we got them. Forgivable, though, in view of the really great taste. 
The service was nice. Attentive, without being overbearing. We stayed past the 10pm closing time, having wine and chatting, and we did not once feel pressured to finish up or leave. 
I'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"I'll remember the service here for sure.   We had 6 of us with 2 kids 6 and 11.    The chef created a special for little man and he loved it.  We had the lamb shank, burger, pork chop, scallops and Salmon and it was all great.   Would recommend this place in a heartbeat."}
{"text":"I'm struggling with the review, the food was good, I had the Cornish game hen and my wife had the swordfish, both very much enjoyed.  But my Old Fashioned was horrible and the service was uneven.  As we we still looking over the menu, the waiter put in for an order of the heirloom tomatoes.  Good choice, but we each wanted an order.  Then came the track race to get us our entree's; they came before my wine arrived.  ugh!  So I'm sorry I can't give a better rating because your food was good, but not the overall experience."}
{"text":"Amazing staff, chef and food! We had the most fabulous experience here!! Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"Early Friday dinner with wife. Waiter very knowledgeable and helpful with the menu. Scallops cooked perfectly for starters.  Lamb Shank outstanding and salmon was spot on. Presentation of both dishes excellent.  Hard to find a complaint!  Highly recommended."}
{"text":"Good, but nothing to rave about. I had a steak and that wasn't up to my expectations."}
{"text":"Had a veal chop with mashed potatoes and brussel sprouts. It was delicious!  Service was excellent.  Would definitely go again."}
{"text":"Extremely welcoming from the moment we got to the restaurant. We called ahead and they held a table for us. The place was right next to the Chelsea Hotel so very convenient. The hostess was extremely friendly and even offered to take a picture of me with my friend. Waiter was so fast and accommodating to his whole section that I swore he had a twin. Very good recommendations and he was able to cater to our tastes and wants with the food and drinks. The charcuterie platter was delicious and the mozzerella was so fresh! The scallops were the best I've ever had and the pasta was so fresh and delicious. Best service and food I've had in a while!"}
{"text":"We came for lunch on a Sunday. Staff was amazing and great atmosphere. We had the duck risotto, burger and sweet potatoes. Everything was delicious and we really enjoyed our lunch!"}
{"text":"Seriously? How this place gets 4.5 stars is beyond me. We had a steak that was medium well rather than medium rare, served with oily fries and dressingless salad. The salmon proved to be reasonable but it was swimming in a strange oily sauce. The side of turnips was just bland. $120 price tag sealed the deal on one of the worst meals I had recently."}
{"text":"This restaurant is amazing. Absolutely amazing food. 

We have been on several occasions for private dining, as well as for a birthday celebration, so we have tried most of the entire menu. Each bite being more heavenly than the last! This is a great find in the city.

I would highly recommend it!"}
{"text":"This is a very nice little restaurant tucked away from the busy streets of downtown TO. The service was excellent, as was the atmosphere. Myself and my girlfriend ordered the pasta of the day and the couple we were with ordered a rack of lamb and fish. The food was delicious, however the portion was far too small. I am 6'1 215lbs, so yes I like larger portions. But to put into perspective, my girlfriend is 5'8 125lbs and she looked at me and said: \"is this all we get?\" Like I said, the food was delicious. But with a 200$ bill, you would expect to leave the table full."}
{"text":"I had lunch there today.........wow is all I can say. second time there and was as good as remembered.

The Greek salad, Sea bass and of corse the poached pear.........outstanding


Roman keep it up love the place"}
{"text":"This place is fantastic but disturbingly quiet.  Too few people have discovered this gem.  I worry that it won't survive the winter. 

I have visited weekly for the last three weeks.  It has been superb every time.  The food is first-rate and the service is very attentive.  This evening I had the braised lamb shank on a bed of squash puree. The two previous times I had the duck confit and mushroom risotto.  On all occasions I drank the Cotes du Rhone by the glass--delicious!

The menu is a bit eclectic, which may be why it isn't drawing a strong crowd.  Perhaps it needs a stronger ethnic or food trend identity.

If you're on Elm Street, skip over the passionless and over-priced Italian options and give the Elm Tree a try."}
{"text":"Food:
Liver Pate: a bit salty but alright 
Duck Confit Risotto: the duck confit was crispy, but rice was over-seasoned.
Pork Chop: overall a legit dish but my friend did not like how the meat had a sweet taste to it

Service:
Not friendly not rude. SUPER slow. Unacceptable. We spent more time waiting (for food, for water refill, for the bill, for everything) than eating.

Reply to Jonathan:
Thank you for following up. We visited about 2 months ago sorry I cannot recall the exact date, but we do remember our server was a slim male."}
{"text":"The food is decent. Would recommend grilled calamari, duck confit and lamb shank. Wine choices are satisfactory. Desserts are way too sweet. Our server was nice enough to offer another dessert and that too was extremely sweet. We had already paid not that we asked for a refund. The night ended on his sarcastic comment: \"why you order dessert if you don't like sugar\". It was just a feedback, I guess they did not need it."}
{"text":"Rude waiters, mediocre food, and overpriced. Was really expecting better service! The only upside for this place is the decor."}
{"text":"Perfect spot for a romantic dinner.The place has a nice feel to it, I would even say ...cozy ?)
Loved the lamb, it was delicious. The server seemed very interested in helping us in the beginning, but later disappeared so we had to get up and pay at the bar."}
{"text":"Had an amazing lunch today. The food was great, the service was very personal and professional. Great atmosphere and interior design,  overall a great place to dine. Prices are average. Will for sure recommend to everyone. I got the lamb shank which was a 5/5 - yum!"}
{"text":"Hidden gem in downtown Toronto. The food and service here is so good! Definitely worth trying and once you do you will go back."}
{"text":"OMG! Food here is delicious! And the service is so friendly! I will definitely keep returning here. So far is a happy long weekend dinner for me and my wife! :)"}
{"text":"My colleague and I were in town for a meeting and had dinner at The ElmTree. The food was spectacular. We both had grilled salmon that was delicious. Our server, Leif, was very attentive to our needs. The service couldn't have been better. The atmosphere is relaxed. We will certainly visit this restaurant again when we are in town."}
{"text":"Great ambience. The servers were friendly and humorous.

Ordered the mushroom risotto duck confit, which was a tad too salty. However, extremely rich and creamy, and a dish I mostly enjoyed."}
{"text":"Sean was an excellent waiter and made the good dining experience even better! Salmon was great!!!!"}
{"text":"Had checked this restaurant out with a group of work colleagues while visiting Toronto.

A colleague had booked a reservation at this restaurant based on reviews she had read and we were not disappointed.  The food was excellent and extremely flavorful (from the appetizers to the main dishes).

We had ordered a wide variety of dishes and it seemed you could not go wrong with any selection.  The waiter was extremely attentive, knowledgeable and friendly. 

Whether you wanted steak, chicken, pork, or seafood, it was all amazing.  Their chef creates daily specials that are just as appetizing to the eyes as they are the taste buds.

If you are into a great Mediterranean dining experience, you should definitley give this restaurant a try."}
{"text":"BAD Service. We accidentally spilled a glass of water and the server STARED AT US WITH A FIERCE GLANCE. He wiped off the water with our napkins and when we said thank you, he said \"my pleasure\" in a sarcastic tone. When we asked ANOTHER SERVER for more napkins, he only gave us two when there were three of us. Unbelievable service on Valentine's Day. 

Food is okay."}
{"text":"Wanted to try a restaurant in the downtown core area and found this nearby eaton center with good reviews.

I'm not sure if I've been eating out too much or what but this restaurant didn't wow me, but still it is very good.  My expectation before I came here was that everything is going to be great and it's gonna be a 5 star rating, unfortunate that was not the case 

To start off, the bread with their homemade sauce was extremely good, much better than your traditional butter that most restaurants provide.

As for appetizer, grilled octopus could have been perfect if it were more tender, our jaw was tired after the grilled octopus appetizer.  It could have been the cooking process or the octopus was simply too old.

The sea bass tasted great, very tender and the vegetable that came with it was amazing.

The pork shank is average, wife agreed with my opinion on the pork shank, she thought it was average too."}
{"text":"Excellent service. Great food! The stuffed ravioli with squash was awesome and quite filling! Highly recommend."}
{"text":"Amazing service, amiable waiters. The food on the other hand is nothing out of this world.  We tried their infamous lamb shank and the salmon for the main entree.the salmon was quite nicely prepared on a bed of tasty couscous salad. But the lamb shan came with a sweet and salty sauce that felt quite heavy and tasted awkward. Overall it was ok but the taste was not to the point that can draw me back again."}
{"text":"The food was fabulous and the staff were friendly and attentive. The lamb shank was tender and full of flavor. I would definitely return!"}
{"text":"Hummus is great! We had the scallops, which were fantastic with the pesto. The cauliflower is very nice and light. Burger is quite large and tasty though I prefer the previous iteration that had fewer toppings as this one got quite messy. Best service we've ever had in a restaurant! Literally impossible to improve, wish I could eat here every day!"}
{"text":"Great atmosphere and amazing food. We had the rack of lamb and the salmon, and both were awesome. The toffee cake was also superb. Not the cheapest place, but well worth the price!"}
{"text":"Wandered into the Elm Tree while traveling on business (staying at the Marriott Eaton) and was more the pleasantly surprised. Great place to sit at the bar and eat if you are alone, or they can sit large groups. My food was excellent and prepared exactly as I requested. Staff was very friendly and attentive. A new place that is already excellent and will only get better."}
{"text":"A group of close friends chose The Elm Tree based on the Yelp reviews. This was a quick dinner before going to a nearby show and we all agreed that on the next visit we would be spending more time to do it justice. The service was simply top notch from entry to quick exit. The dishes were uniformly spectacular with honorable mention to the duck risotto. We did not have time to order wine but the list was more than adequate with a few that I dearly would have loved to try. As it was, there is a selection of craft beers that hit the right notes. The ambiance is sophisticated without being overwhelming. Perfect for a date night but comfortable enough for a group. I will absolutely be back to try it under a less pressing schedule but good to know they can accommodate that also."}
{"text":"My friend and I came here last evening because the restaurant we intended to visit was having a holiday party and was closed to the public. Neither of us had been here before, but the menu looked good so we thought we'd give it a shot. 

Service was really good. Well-paced, friendly, and efficient.

The food was quite good as well. I ordered the lamb shank and it is tender and succulent. They present the dish with a few large stems of parsley across the top. Frankly, I would have preferred that they finely chopped that parsley and sprinkled it on top so I could eat it with the dish. The sauce was quite rich and it could have used those pops of bright herbaciousness to give your tastebuds a wakeup. Serving the parsley as merely a garnish was a wasted opportunity. 

I ordered the poached pear for dessert and to my surprise, it came with a whole plateful of sweetened mascarpone cheese. If the menu had stated that it came with cheese, I would have asked them to hold off because I don't eat cheese. I think they should more accurately describe the desserts on the menu. When you order a poached pear, you're not really expecting a pile of cheese. That was a waste of cheese and that's not good to surprise people who might be lactose intolerant, or allergic to dairy, or merely a cheese hater."}
{"text":"I will definitely come here again. 

This is a nondescript restaurant from the outside and in fact a bit out of the way to get to as it's on the quiet Elm Street off of Yonge. It's nice and cozy inside AND PACKED. It is evident that a lot of regulars come here and it is there secret place they don't want to share!

We were promptly brought tap water after sitting down and given ample time to review the wine and food menu without pressure. While I occasionally order bottled water, I hate how all the restaurants are pushing it nowadays - I want a glass of water right away when I sit down and I don't care if it's flat or sparkling!!! The wines were reasonably priced and so of course we had to start with some prosecco which was actually really good - I also finished off the evening with this.

The food was very good and the dishes were presented beautifully (my pictures don't do it justice due to the dim lighting and lazy angles I took them from). The Cornish hen was a beautiful dish with in season Brussels sprouts. The wild mushroom risotto as you can see only had bits of duck now as opposed to the whole duck you see in pictures - the waiter informed me the changed was made 2.5 months ago. Anyway I was a bit disappointed but the risotto was good but a bit too salty, there wasn't as much duck as I had hoped. 

The dessert was a lemon pistachio pie/tart - it was the daily special. It was quite a generous sized dessert - I couldn't finish. There was a very strong lemon flavor which I loved and a generous portion of pistachio. The rum hot chocolate was also amazing. The waiter let's you smell the rum before pouring it in - very honest pour!

As I said at the beginning... I will be back!"}
{"text":"We came here while visiting Niagara Falls and my cousin recommended to come eat here. Had a wonderful experience eating at the restaurant! Chef Ben and his staff were exceptional and each dish which was plated beautifully was outstanding in taste!! There was not one dish that failed our taste buds! Even our teenagers who tried the crispy sweetbreads and beef carpaccio enjoyed it - which are dishes they would not normally try! The smoked salmon, fried cauliflower, and scallops were delightful as well! The mushroom risotto with duck confit was very filling! My parents had the rack of lamb and we had the Cornish hen - all very delicious and the hen was truly moist!! Loved all of it!! At the recommended wine pairings with each dish was perfect! And our server Kelly was just wonderful, she explained all the dishes to us and made us feel at home! Definitely a place great for groups!"}
{"text":"Came here for a family dinner. We were the only table seated in the restaurant upon arriving. We ordered the beef carpaccio as an appetizer and mushroom risotto, lamb shank, cornish hen and barramundi as our mains. No complaints about the food and it was reasonably priced. The only complaint we had was about the water we drank. Upon recieving the bill, our waiter, Andrew, had charged us almost $13 for the water we drank! When we ordered water to drink we did not realize we were asking for the most expensive water the restaurant had. We felt as if we had been swindled, which put a huge damper on our mood. Food was satisfactory but doubt we will be back because of the expirience."}
{"text":"My Aunt and I ate there the other night. I've been travelling on business so it was wonderful to find a place where the service was attentive but not over bearing. They left us enough space to catch-up and enjoy our conversation. The food was wonderful. I had the lamb shank and she had the burger. Both top notch. Her Greek salad had a great balance of feta to pepper and cucumber ratio. I would go there again."}
{"text":"Great food. Amazing service in a cozy atmosphere. I would go back, it must be even better for dinner . The waitress went above and beyond for us."}
{"text":"Woah, how did I just now discover this place? So charming and romantic inside. Great date spot. The service was excellent and the portions were very generous. We split the fried cauliflower (beyond delicious and flavorful), scallops (very good and served on a tasty parsnip purée), and the Cornish hen (tons of flavor, very well done, and a huge portion). I was really surprised with the portions as I was expecting tapas-sized portions. We were so full from the two apps, we couldn't finish the Cornish hen. And we rarely have leftovers. This is going to be our go to date spot for celebrations, birthdays, etc. 

Oh and the complimentary bread and hummus. The hummus was amazing and bread was warm. When we finished our first basket they asked if we wanted another. We said sure and they brought more bread and hummus at no extra charge!"}
{"text":"Keeping it short, had an amazing experience at the restaurant while on a business trip. Service was great, very friendly and had excellent suggestions. The decor was nice and the food was fantastic. Whenever I'm in Toronto again, I am coming here."}
{"text":"The lamb shank is really good. The service is really nice."}
{"text":"Will definitely be back, most likely for supper.
We went hear for a team lunch on the recommendation of a friend.
Food was great.
I had the mushroom risotto which was very tasty. A friend had the steak which he says is one of the best he's ever had.
Service was average, but attentive throughout most of the meal.
Price is a little above average for lunch, but the food is also above average, so depends on what you're looking for.
Will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Went there in Sept 2017 with my boyfriend for our anniversary. This is one of the best restaurants we have tried so far. The service was amazing, food was excellent and I loved the atmosphere. The servers were very attentive and answered all of our questions, took away the plates as soon as we were done and filled our water glasses regularly. We got the soup of the day (squash ginger soup) which they split into two for us, lamb shank (sooooo good) and the autumn herb salad. We also got a dessert which I do not remember the name of but it was heavenly.
In summary:
Amazing food, excellent service and great vibe. If you are debating whether you should go there or not, GO!"}
{"text":"Lovely food, lovely service. Large portions of delicious food. The deceptively simple mushroom and arugula salad was simply scrumptious. As a woman dining alone, sometimes service can be an issue: not here. The service was efficient, professional and thoughtful. This is a little gem. The atmosphere is conducive to enjoying your meal, relaxed and unstuffy, friendly without being intrusive. Go here! I had a wonderful Manhattan cocktail too!"}
{"text":"Amazing food and drinks with super friendly staff!! Definitely a spot I would recommend, keeps me coming back and wanting to try the entire menu!! Nice change from some of the typical restaurants in the area!"}
{"text":"Legitimately the best meal I've had in well over a year.

The Elm Tree is a lovely little establishment that's still pretty new on the scene. The environment is casual but nice, and the food is absolutely amazing without being snobby (read: decent portions, and at reasonable prices!). Our server had a refreshing understanding of his wines and pairings, and his enthusiasm really carried through in making our experience a positive one.

I had the Chilean Sea Bass, which was spot on - perfect buttery flesh with a crisp, well-seasoned skin. There was nothing about it that I would want to change. My friend had the pork chop, which was also good. For dessert our server recommended the toffee cake, which again was everything I'd ever hoped for. Even the eggplant the served with our bread was tasty, and a nice touch.

Overall, this was such a positive experience, and I'm already looking forward to my next visit."}
{"text":"Wonderful dinner experience at the Elm Tree last evening.  As others have mentioned, a compact menu, but everything appeared thoughtful and delicious.  Our food was terrific and really felt like good value.  Our server was knowledgable and enthusiastic, guiding us through food and wine choices with real expertise.  In all, a nice relaxed dinner experience, I would definitely go again."}
{"text":"Food was amazing, service was very friendly and knowledgeable, a real hidden gem.

Three of the four people in my group had the duck confit which is apparently their specialty and everyone raved about it. My girlfriend had the sea bass which was very good as well.

I'll definitely be back"}
{"text":"Impressive service, spectacular food, great date spot. I loved everything about the spot and the food."}
{"text":"Hands down my favourite meal in Toronto so far. I cannot stop raving about this place.

We were making our way down Elm Street and a man greeted us outside in the cold to bring us in. He was outside the entire evening, welcoming customers. Our main server was very pleasant and attentive. Other servers were happy to ensure that our glasses were always full of water. Great service altogether. The ambiance was also nice. Not too dim so that you can actually look around and see things; and there was soft pop playing in the background. 

But most importantly...what about the food? TOO GOOD TO MISS! 
We started off with complimentary fresh baguette with housemade hummus. Boyfriend and I ordered 2 appies: the beef carpaccio and grilled calamari + ratatouille. The beef carpaccio was huge, nicely presented and very well flavoured. The real winner (though honestly every dish was a winner) was the calamari. I actually am not a fan of squid or octopus, but this calamari was amazing. When cutting it, the knife slides through like butter. Eating it, it was so soft and far from rubbery. We were blown away and never had anything like this. How on earth was this prepared?! And it was only $10!

For mains, I got the roasted pork chop, which literally could feed a dinosaur. If this was Masterchef, Ramsay would be sure to say that this portion size was ridiculous. But I ain't complaining! The pork, although thick, was juicy and cooked through. Again, how did they treat the pork? Mushrooms and fingerling potatoes were also delicious with the sauce. My boyfriend ordered the Chilean sea bass, with saffran rice. The sea bass flaked off so easily and melted in our mouths like butter. Amazing. Its skin was good as well, and the rice was fragrant. 

Given the generous portions, we were both stuffed at the end of the meal and couldn't find any room for dessert. 

Go to Elm Tree Restaurant for a wonderful meal in downtown Toronto! You won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"In our first night in Toronto we had the pleasant surprise to have dinner at the Elm Tree. The service was impeccable and very friendly. We decided to share an octopus as an entree and as themain course, the wild mushroom risotto and the beef tenderloin. All three dishes were marvelous. Incredibly fresh and flavourful! We truly recommend this restaurant!!"}
{"text":"The lamb shank is the best ...believe the hype. The duck confit was pretty good too but the duck was a bit dry, the risotto on the other hand is one of the best I had. We had warm toffee cake for dessert which is delish"}
{"text":"This is my go to place for a nice and fancy dinner. It's a bit on the expensive side, but the food is always good and each dish has a different flavor. Had the lamb rack and the Cornish hen, both were juicy and tender, hen was a little bit on the burnt side though. Waiter was incredibly friendly but was a little slow to take our order."}
{"text":"The entire dinner was more of an experience. From the appetizer to the dessert, each course was consistently of the highest quality with delightful service from Leif.

We had the Calamari (7/10) and Ratatouille and Sauteed Shrimp (9/10) for appetizers, Duck Confit (8/10) and the Lamb Shank (10/10).

We went with the suggestion of fellow users for the dessert and got the Toffee Cake. OMG so goooooood (11/10).

Overall, an excellent venue and everyone working there seemed to genuinely love their work and appreciate your business."}
{"text":"We visited Toronto for fun this year (from the US) and found about this restaurant on Yelp. While trying to find it, we actually walked right past it! It's definitely a little hole-in-the-wall, but what a gem. 
The service was great- we loved our waiter. The atmosphere was also really special, and I loved the decor and feel of the entire place. They put out bread and a special olive spread which I couldn't get enough of - I begged our waiter to take it away! It was so good. We then had the cheese stuffed portobello on top of a bed of arugula. Very good.
For our dinner my boyfriend had the Bacon Grueyere Burger, and although I don't eat meat, he said it was delicious. The waiter told us they make the patties right on site. I had the papardelle with mushrooms and black truffle oil and it was soo good, I wish I had a larger stomach to fit more in. I did manage to find a little extra room for dessert, though, when the waiter mentioned a toffee cake served with vanilla ice cream and caramel - IT WAS AMAZING. So soft and the flavors were just spectacular.
I hope this place lasts, because we will definitely be back if we venture back to Toronto!!"}
{"text":"We thoroughly enjoyed our meals. My partner is vegetarian and she was able to select from the menu. We recommend this place."}
{"text":"I don't often get to this part of town so I looked at Yelp reviews to find a place for us to eat. What a nice little place. A really enjoyable atmosphere. I had the lamb shank and it was very good and no overcooked. My wife had the Cornish Hen and though it was excellent as well. Place was a little dark for my taste but clearly most people like it. Certainly worth a return visit!"}
{"text":"This is a follow up to my original review a few months back. 

If you haven't been to Elm Tree, you're seriously missing out. The food is fantastic and the people who work there are the absolute best. I travel alone and sit at the bar but it's a great date place or a nice spot to hold a party. 

Stop reading and get over there!"}
{"text":"Came here around 7:30pm on a Saturday night, and surprisingly there were still a lot of seatings available. We started off with some homemade bread (not quite warm enough) and hummus with olive oil - I must say, the hummus was pretty good. 

For main, I ordered the Wild Mushroom Risotto. I was pretty disappointed that it's not offered as a whole duck leg anymore as previous pictures but rather small pieces mixed in. Overall, it was mixed well with the risotto, making it very flavourful. 

Pricing are fair - approx. ~$30-35 after tax+tips."}
{"text":"Was introduced to the Elm Tree last night by my son & daughter, where we (plus my wife) had a late supper on the street side patio. What a lovely place! Though it was a hot, humid night (& I was at first wary to be outside) the patio was shaded by the surrounding buildings and a nice, gentle breeze kept the air fresh. And the food was excellent! I started with a grilled calamari/ratatouille salad (superb!) and my wife found the beet & goat cheese salad \"yummy.\" The women had the grilled salmon with fennel and loved it. My son was impressed by the Chilean sea bass, while I was whisked back to my time in Marrakech by the braised lamb shank with couscous and a gravy which noticeably included fig. Tender, sweet, succulent! Our waitress was quick to attend our needs, be it freshening water, checking into (and attaining) our special requests/modifications to our orders, or finishing up our meal with bill and payment. This is definitely a place I will come back to for a medium-ranged price meal. Well done!"}
{"text":"I love coming here on special occasions. Food is yummy and service is excellent. I highly recommend the duck risotto or the steak sandwich."}
{"text":"We had a wonderful dinner and desert there during our recent trip to Toronto. I recommend the lamb shank. The toffee cake was a tasty dessert combined with a perfectly made cappuccino."}
{"text":"Everyone else seems to be enjoying this place so much that you should ignore this review and give it a try.  If you're like most people, you'll like it here.  Me? I know I won't be back. This place just doesn't tickle my fancy.

A warm mushroom and arugula salad was my favourite dish.  It reminded me that anyone could really make this at home without breaking a sweat.  Scallops in a sweet pear sauce just didn't quite work for me.  The pear sauce was too sweet for my liking and didn't really enhance the scallop flavour.  However, there's no denying that the scallops themselves were high quality and seared perfectly.  

The same cannot be said about the duck confit. I had to spit out the first bite because it was burning my tongue.  Was it microwaved?  It was certainly overcooked and quite dry.  The confit was very good though.  I also tried the leg of lamb with couscous.  The lamb was perfectly cooked, but, like the scallops it was in a sauce that was a bit too sweet and perfumed for my tastes.  

Service was extremely friendly and attentive.  The atmosphere was very comfortable.  Music was enjoyable R&B classics and not too loud. It's a busy room, with lots of diners packed in tight, so conversations require a bit of voice projection.  But you probably like that kinda thing.  So, enjoy!"}
{"text":"We ate here last night. The food was superb. And the service was outstanding without being pretentious. The room is simple and cozy. All of the food we ate , grilled salmon, lamb shanks, and carbonara can be found at many restaurants but each of these entrees not only was cooked to perfection but had extra ingredients that made them special. The salmon was on a bed of fennel and the two went together perfectly. Finally, this meal in the U. S. Would have been twice the price. Also, I wear hearing aids and sometimes can have difficulty hearing in restaurants; this place had acoustics like you are in your own living room. Eat here, you will be happy."}
{"text":"Just had the greatest meal. The lamb shank, Duck confit , Cornish game hen, orange cheesecake, creme brûlée and beet salad were fantastic. Crazy Tracy was an awesome server and host. She was so knowledgeable and fun!"}
{"text":"The veal special was outstanding!!  As was the salmon.... everything was perfectly cooked.  Blue cheese mashed are amazing!!    Delicious!
Ambiance was comfortable,  casual.  Not too loud, not too bright.  
Our waiter, Sean.  provided excellent service.  He was friendly and personable.   Above and beyond expectations!
Love this place!"}
{"text":"Beem open for 3 months, off to a good start, but has a few kinks that need to be worked out. Price is a steal for the serving size of the dishes. The food is beautifully plated, but the execution and conceptualization needs a bit more work. Cozy interrior, though the room is all hard surfaces which means the dinnertime conversations were loud. The waitress was attentive and quick to offer bread basket and tapanade refills. We ordered the pan seared pesto calamari on a potato latke. The latke was delicious with the slight sweetness if the onion coming through, though much too oily/heavy for pairing with calamari. The calamari was tender, but drowned in the pesto, lemon sauce. The balsamic reduction on the bottom of the plate, while pretty, didn't cohere with the rest of the dish. The boyfriend had the flattened cornish hen which was served on a heap of coleslaw. The hen was flavourful and temder, but the coleslaw was flavorless, chopped too finely, and warm from the chicken atop it. My duck confit risotto was definitely the better dish with a rich, creamy risotto generously dotted with mushrooms. The skin wasn't crisp, however, and I found it weird that the risotto was garnished with green onions (I would've preferred chives). All in all, a great meal for a fantastic price given the part of town we're in. Would definitely be back for the attentive service and to see if the food improves."}
{"text":"Pros:
Food is crazy good ( duck confit) 
Price is decent 
Service was incredible and very knowledgeable 
Interior design is great! 


Cons:
Nothing yet"}
{"text":"My partner and I went to this restaurant on a Monday evening and were the only ones there. So grateful to have stumbled upon this quaint, cozy, welcoming, lovely little gem. We loved everything we ate, the drinks were great, and the service was excellent. I highly recommend this place!"}
{"text":"We were visiting Toronto and we found this restaurant due to reviews.  We did not have a reservation and we were lucky we only waited a few minutes on a Thursday evening.  We ordered the pork chop and shank and some wine.  After our first bite of our meal, our mouths.were so excited by the wonderful flavors.  We ate slow because we did not want the dinner to end.  The wine was also a good choice with the help of the waiter.  The service was great and a very friendly staff.  We loved it so much we returned a few nights later.  This time we had the pork chop and the steak.  Delicious!!!"}
{"text":"I enjoyed my time at this restaurant. Andres is a great waiter and the food was delicious. The menu items I had during my two visits here were grilled octopus, duck confit, lamb shank, and toffee cake. My only tidbit is the overwhelming flavor of the lamb shank sauce that could be easily fixed by placing the sauce on the side.

I had a great time and will be back on my next visit to Toronto. Thanks Andres and Jonathan."}
{"text":"Stopped here by chance. The waitress was super nice, convincing us to try it out. This place has a great little outdoor seating are that is surprisingly calm in the midst of the city.
First they bring you bread and hummus which was very very good. I had the cheddar burger at her recommendation which was quite tasty. I'd say the toppings were what made it as the burger itself didn't seem all that great but over all a decent option.
I ended with a cappuccino which was also very good. Great service, would definitely recommend coming here."}
{"text":"I had a lovely meal here with my sister when visiting Toronto a few weeks ago! There were so many great dishes on the menu - it was hard to know what to get. We opted for sharing several plates including: fried cauliflower, which was quite creamy, the Scallops, with the pancetta and pistachios adding some nice flavour and texture, and the daily pasta, which was a cheese tortellini with some greens and a light sauce. Everything tasted great!

The service made the dinner a 5-star experience! The waiter was very patient as we made our decision and helpful with recommendations. We did not feel rushed at any point, even after we finished eating but were enjoying the rest of our wine.

The restaurant was rather empty on a Friday night - people should definitely check it out!"}
{"text":"I loved the mushrooms risotto. Very good food, both fresh, delicate and tasty. Perfect !"}
{"text":"The place was a close 5-minute walk from Eaton Centre. It was off of a Yonge side street. The restaurant had a dim, dark atmosphere. It's a higher end, more upscale restaurant. The crowd was more for romantic dinners or professional dinners for work.

There was complimentary bread with butter to start. The food was unique, with a lot of flavour. However, it was quite oily. It'll give you the runs if you have a weak stomach  =|

I got the pork belly. It was a bit too fatty. There weren't many sides. The portion wasn't a lot. It wasn't cheap either, $25 per dish. Lots of alcoholic options. Overall, it was just okay."}
{"text":"Very good atmosphere, staff is friendly and helpful! The food is amazing, ordered a beef shank,sea bass,grilled octopus,beef carpaccio and steak. Lamb melts in your mouth! Sea bass is very rich tasting! Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"The food was alright, but I really like the environment. It is very family oriented place."}
{"text":"4.5/5 
Came at lunch. Ordered duck liver Pate (not as creamy and smoothy as the regular pate, nonetheless It's delicious. Not enough toast came with it tho :3 ). Lamb shank. Pan seared sea bass. And duck confit (risotto under it were sooo good) 

The server feels like your uncle. He was so happy Cuz we emptied our plate. 

Poached pear as dessert. The mascarpone cheese tastes fantastic with the pear. 

Overall very nice experience. 

Sugar high right now ...."}
{"text":"I had walked by this place countless times and had no idea what a little gem it is! The food was absolutely delicious - we went for lunch and tried a few different things: grilled chicken salad, broccoli, crispy brussel sprouts, beef shawarma. The salad was very flavourful and a great portion size, and the brussel sprouts were definitely the highlight. Service was very friendly and our waiter always made sure water was replenished. The restaurant itself is rather small, but very cozy. Overall a really great experience and I will definitely be going back!"}
{"text":"We thought an outside table was our choice, but we were happy to go inside the restaurant to begin our dining experience with a cocktail or bottle of wine.  Although the cocktail menu had some interesting choices, we opted for a bottle of Argentinian Malbec, which was so satisfying with our \"special-of-the-day appetizer\" - Carpaccio, my husband's Rack of Lamb, and my Barramundi.  Came inside and remained inside - the front \"garage door\" window was open which made us feel like we were outside (without the street invading our peace).  Lovely music, decor, and exceptional waitstaff.  Miran, our waiter, could have been the owner; he clearly loved his career and excelled at food knowledge and philosophy!  We felt like our first night in Toronto would be our best memory of our time visiting.  Thank you Elm Tree Restaurant for your gracious hospitality!"}
{"text":"I'd like to preface how I chose this restaurant. We were at the Eaton center shopping, and I was on yelp trying to find a vegetarian friendly place that was within our budget. This place popped up as vegetarian friendly (there were 8 of us, and 6 vegetarians). It was a very last minute decision but I called they could accommodate our party, so we went. 

When I got there, that was the first time I saw the menu which displayed a dinner entree with meat. It was disappointing for some people, but they had to be marked vegetarian friendly for a reason, right? I asked our server who was absolutely a gem, and he let us know that they could prepare certain entrees without the duck jus, etc. We ended up getting food family style instead of traditional one entree per person. A lot of their appetizers and sides were vegetarian, we got one of everything with 2 main entrees - the mushroom risotto and the butternut squash ravioli. 

If I could do it all over again, I would probably look at their menu before going there and maybe not go with so many vegetarians (they were left disappointed), but I personally enjoyed my experience there!"}
{"text":"It was a busy night for the restaurant and we appreciate that they gave us a table even though we did not have a reservation. My daughter and I had the cornish hen and the lamb shank, which we shared. Both were perfectly seasoned and cooked and were very enjoyable. Plus the yummy crispy fries. But my favorite part of the meal was the summer salad. It's hard to make a salad with wow factor but this salad had it. The presentation was artistic, the components were a perfect complement, and the dressing had just the right amount of acid and fat. Note that most of the offerings on the menu are rich and heavy - it is not the place to grab a lite dinner. Service was very professional."}
{"text":"Outstanding! We didn't have a reservation and they were still able to seat us. Very nice ambience. Food was fabulous and beautifully presented -- appetizer special was a salmon crudo with beet and other vegetable purée. The fried cauliflower was delicious with yogurt and harissa. Butternut squash ravioli and mushroom risotto were also excellent. Hazelnut baklava was okay (a little dense). The server was super friendly. Will definitely come back here next visit."}
{"text":"Ok... so I'm in the industry so I'll only review places far far away from my market.

I ate here alone because I was in town in business.. looked at the yelp page and was ambivalent, but wanted a good gamble that was close to my hotel. Pulled the trigger.

Service was excellent. I play a game where I ask the waiter what he's order given three options... one lower price that I mention I saw a positive review about, and two higher price that look like signature dishes... he did extoll the virtues of the lower priced duck risotto, but pointed out that with the wine I had ordered the duck breast would be complimented compared to the filet mignon. I was sold.

I was dining alone so I did not sample an appetizer.. but the carpaccio looked great on he menu, and on the table beside me.... I will return to sample that.


My duck breast arrive perfectly presented medium rare, was exquisitely seasoned, warm, with a perfectly crisp skin. This ain't easy... people do not order duck. The side of pistachio stuffed endive was maybe the best thing I've eaten this year. And the bugler cous cous dressed with duck jus and figs was delightful.

It's a busy place... but it's Toronto. Do yourself a favour... try this restaurant."}
{"text":"This was a great experience in central toronto. Definitely stop by! Kelli was a wonderful server, very attentive, and sweet. The food was superb. Everything we ate had a myriad of flavors that complimented each other exquisitely. Pictures is the lamb shank, mushroom risotto, salmon over a bed of beet quinoa, French fries, and the brussel sprouts. The brussel sprouts were surely a favorite, but pomegranates with the salmon dish made for a refreshing treat"}
{"text":"mixed feelings about this place.  it was a last minute choice when original reso fell through.  wouldn't go back but didn't loathe it.  our annoying server was dripping with smarm and that didn't help matters.

the pros:

*the daily pasta was f'ing delicious.  full stop. tagliatelle with mushrooms, cream & parsley.
*thoughtful and well executed specialty cocktails
*lovely hummus and warm bread for the table
*prompt and constant water refills by server assistant

the cons:

*phony, icky server. years of serving has ruined me and made me cynical and picky.  what can i say? fine, get your up-sell on, but don't be so desperate and transparent about it. and yeah, if i'm ordering a \"vodka martini\", go for the gold. but if the resto offers house/specialty cocktails, with house infused spirits, why are you trying to swindle me into an unnecessary charge? the reason i picked this drink was because of the ingredients listed. this may work on the average diner, but just a crappy thing to do.
*if you have daily specials listed on your menu at MP, mention the market price! the item is described as \"daily fish, MP\". which means the server has to tell you what it actually is. if you're going through all that, it's only intentional to leave out the price.  either the price is too low and you're trying to discourage guests from ordering it to keep your tab high, or it's high and it's better (for you) left unsaid.
*server went through 75% of the menu, line by line, after we had read it for ourselves. yawn.
*my partner ordered the duck confit with risotto.  he found it on the small side and left feeling not quite sated. 
*i ordered the scallops.  a bit of a disappointment. a robust size, cooked slightly rare, on a bed of apple puree. it was well intentioned, but a titch too sweet and the cold puree only served to make the rare-ish scallops colder. the sear was beautiful, but the inside...lackluster. 

overall, had the server been...genuine, it would have been a better experience. improvement needed on a few of the dishes, but a solid delivery."}
{"text":"What a great gem of a place.  I didn't have high hopes b/c I am generally lukewarm about Mediterranean food.  I went with a larger group and I'll start by saying that the service was wonderful and pretty much seamless.  

Complimentary bread was a nice touch - fresh and the hummus it was served with was really good.  Reminded me of Boba on Avenue (anyone remember this old place from the early 2000s?).  Excellent.  Why can't you buy hummus like that in stores??

I had the carrot ginger soup to begin.  It was pretty good, but nothing special.  Maybe a touch under seasoned.

Then I had the burrata salad which was phenomenal.  Truly.  The cheese was a large ball and the dish was flanked with roasted garlic cloves, a delicate pesto, crispy shallots, roasted cherry tomatoes, micro greens and wonderfully toasted bread.  Fabulous.

As a side (which I didn't need b/c the aforementioned salad was generous), I had the crispy cauliflower.  It was served atop house made labaneh, which google tells me is just yogurt (essentially), but it was delicious.  Lemon, fresh tasting, and the accompanying radishes and onions went well with the cauliflower.

A cute spot for after work drinks and dinner.  I will surely return!"}
{"text":"I LOVE this place!!  Came by for dinner on a Friday night and everything from food to atmosphere was simply PERFECT!! 

Waiters were very knowledgeable and helpful with the wine and food menu. The atmosphere was very romantic which was fitting for 2 (or even 4) people. Let me just say that if you want to impress someone on a date - this place is it.

The butter that came with the bread was SO unique!! If I remember correctly it was made infused with honey! So good!!! For the main course we got the Cornish hen and the lamb shank. The Cornish hen is amazing and the lamb shank?! Omg fall off the bone tender and sooo juicy and tasty!!

I am DEFINITELY coming back and I highly highly recommend this restaurant!!! You won't regret it!!"}
{"text":"Best duck confit risotto I have ever had! And my mother said their appetizers were so special that they tasted even better than the entree she had. We ordered every appetizers and they are really good! Nice classy atmosphere!"}
{"text":"Interior is a bit outdated, food is salty/burnt. The owner is either outside escorting people to come in or inside talking to customers with too much enthusiasm. It's a bit too friendly when you're trying to enjoy a nice meal. 

I understand that mediterranean food tends to be on the saltier side and my personal preference is 'light seasoning'. I'm certain other people did enjoy their food, unfortunately Elm Tree is not my kind of restaurant. Just a personal preference."}
{"text":"I ordered a dirty martini, the scallop appetizer, and the duck confit on a bed of wild mushroom risotto. The martini was great and came with 3 olives! However, I wish I had known the warm table bread would come with an olive purée spread. It was delicious, but I had a hard time finishing my dirty Martini which came with a lot of olive brine. The scallops were seared to perfection and had a very complimentary salty flavour to the sweet apple purée that it comes with. The duck was also seared, causing its skin to have a fantastic crispy texture while keeping the meat juicy. The risotto had the perfect bite to it, and its creamy sauce had just the right amount of umami so that it was incredibly satisfying but I was able to finish the entire (generous) portion of risotto. My boyfriend had the lamb shank which was fall off the bone tender with a great butternut squash purée and gravy which played against each other very subtly as sweet and savoury.

The service was attentive but not smothering. The restaurant was relatively empty, though it was a Monday at 6pm. Most importantly it was refined food in a setting that wasn't stuffy and pretentious. I felt like I was in a classier venue, but I didn't feel uncomfortable or out of place. I had such an enjoyable experience that it has garnered my first ever restaurant review!"}
{"text":"Best meal I have had in a while!! Top notch restaurant, the favours are incredible and you truly get to enjoy every single bite! We have learned while at the restaurant that they lamb shank is halal if you're looking for halal options in the downtown area! Deftly retuning"}
{"text":"Our first day in Toronto and hard to find a Friday night reservation. So glad we found this place. Super friendly. Excellent cocktails. (mine included my favorite Fernet Branca). I had the duck confit and my husband had the cornish hen. Chocolate mousse for desert. The staff were very nice and the place had a great vibe. Everyone was having fun. An easy walk from downtown."}
{"text":"I came here on my birthday with a few of my friends and I had an awesome time! We had a reservation on a Monday night, which wasn't really necessary as it wasn't too busy but better safe than sorry right?! We were greeted from outside of the restaurant where the waiter welcomed us and tok us to our seats inside. The atmosphere was perfect for us - not too loud, dimmed lights, warm and suitable to dress nicely.

We ordered some appetizers which I recommend the carpaccio! For the main dish, I order grilled salmon with the side of sweet potatoes glazed with maple syrup and topped with pines. Surprisingly, the portion s were pretty good. I got a nice, beautiful salmon belly and was stuffed after eating the whole dish without even starting on my sweet potatoes! I absolutely had no room for dessert although I really wanted to try some. If you're going to get appetizers, don't order any sides with your main dish! 

Our waiter was super friendly and was glad to help us take many pictures of us for the ocassion until the end of our meal. After rejecting dessert, he was curious as to why we came here for dinner and we told him it was my friends and I birthday. We asked for the bill and it took him quite a while to bring it to us. We didn't really noticed since we were just talking and catching up until he came out with two desserts for us!! He sang happy birthday and gave it to us on the house (ofc, we gave him much more tips!)

Really great experience and  service, will come here again for sure."}
{"text":"We ate at elm Street, last night. I can say that it was honestly one of the better meals that I have had in a restaurant. To give a little background, I have two friends that have been chefs in Michelin star restaurants, and I also love to cook. We usually don't expect much in restaurants. However, the duck confirm, and the lamb shanks were perfect. I don't have a better description than that. I started with the calamari with ratatouille and it was smoky and flavorful, and the calamari was buttery. I tried the salad and the scallops and they were both excellent. The only hesitation I have is to blow a good secret. But, I really wish for this restaurant to succeed, so I had to give this review. Good job guys. Really."}
{"text":"During my 20 hours in Toronto, I went here for a late work dinner (reservation was for 9pm) on Thursday night. We chose this place because of its proximity to our venue, the Marriott Eaton Centre. 

The space is cozy and chic, with dim lighting and nice decor. Our group of about 15 were seated comfortably at the long middle table. We ordered cocktails, the Golden Hour and Ginger Cosmo were both hits, as well as a bottle of Pinor Noir. 

A variety of appetizers were speedily brought to our table, and I enjoyed sampling scallops, octopus, smoked salmon, and beef carpaccio. Oh and how could I forget - the bread came with this AMAZING butter, and when we asked, the staff informed us that it is made with date syrup. I never thought I'd like bread & butter this much!

For my entree, I asked our waiter which lamb dish he recommended, and he immediately said the shank. Boy, was he on point. The lamb shank was tender, flavorful, and with a great sauce. Those of us who ordered this devoured it happily.

The dessert menu is just as enticing as the food! We ordered a variety to share: pistachio cream, maple cheesecake, chocolate torte, and baklava. The cheesecake was probably my favorite, but each was a delight to try! Topped it all off with a decaf latte which came topped with great foam and a Swiss chocolate. Simply perfect!"}
{"text":"Thank you, Yelpers, for leading us to a culinary delight! Seared scallop, roasted beet with goat cheese appetizers...main courses loin steak, rack of lamp, fish of the day--all excellent! Outstanding service, great atmosphere. Best meal of the trip so far."}
{"text":"I had a great experience at The Elm Tree this past Sunday night. My friend and I had just finished at the Elmwood Spa down the street and walked in with no reservations this long weekend.

Food - I was very impressed with the dishes for the price served. My friend and I shared the Calamari w/ Ratatouille, while we bother ordered the Duck Confit w/ Risotto. The calamari was one of the smoothest I've ever had, and complemented the spices in the ratatouille. The duck confit w/ risotto was very creamy and ended up being a very heavy dish. They also served bread w/ hummus throughout the meal, which was a nice Mediterranean touch.

Service - Excellent service. Our waiter constantly refilled our bread and hummus throughout the meal and was attentive. 

Ambience - The restaurant was slightly dim and had a nice ambience to it. Would recommend for a date or gathering with friends."}
{"text":"We had our company lunch at this location. When we walked in, I felt it was pretty tight but the place feels chic. Nice casual decor. 

The options are fairly limited but for what they do have, it is flavourful. I did have the Morrocan lamb shank whose foods are known to be flavourful. Needless to say, I was satisfied, price and portion wise.

They could really have more beer options, but I guess it's more of a wine place."}
{"text":"So as I was Yelping for a restaurant, Elm Tree came up to be reasonably priced for a restaurant downtown as well as the food portions/ drink menu and etcc....

I made reservations for 6pm and walked here from work, for the love of downtown..everywhere is practically walkable...which I love....the ratings here 3.5-4 star so in the back of my mind, thats a pretty good average...Walked in, was searted promptly, drink menus were provided and food menu as well. So as I was waiting for my friend to arrive...i ordered a prosecco to start the evening

The menu did have limits in terms of variety but that didn't bother me too much as long as the quality was there...i think they have may 10 items in each category from steak to seafood...

I ended up ordering a couscous salad to start which had a nice chic presentation and it tasted good as well, got myself another glass of chardonnay which enhanced my overall experience...

For my main dish, i got the mushroom with duck confit risotto but mine didn't look like any of the Yelp pics as those had a whole duck leg or something, mine was just pieces and scraps of duck meat...(minus 1 star)

Overall, it was a good experience, a place where I will come back"}
{"text":"Before heading to Elmwood Spa I decided I wanted a bite to eat so I decided to check this place out that's located pretty much across from the spa.  

As it was a Monday after the usual lunch time crowd (around 1:30pm) it was pretty empty.  It's a huge space that can definitely accommodate a large crowd.  It must be packed at dinenr time.

There's a big window overlooking Elm street, low lighting, cushions on the booth seating. The service was really great and super friendly - making small talk, telling me about the specials etc.

The menu (at least the lunch options) are small - something that I appreciate.  I hate being overwhelmed with too many choices.  I decided on the Duck Risotto, with crispy duck pieces.

You do get started with some warm bread and hummus, which is a perfect option to have while you sip on your wine/cocktail.

My risotto was pretty much perfection (slightly too salty as I got into eating it, but still delicious).  I only wish there were more of the crispy duck pieces on top - oh my - the flavourful crunch to the softness of the risotto was lovely.  

The risotto itself was nice and creamy and had lots of pulled duck meat in it.  It was a decent size portion and I was incredibly sad that the little bit that I had leftover I couldn't pack up and take with me because I was visiting the spa next and there was nowhere for me to store it.

I will definitely check out this place again - maybe for dinner."}
{"text":"The service matches the creativity of the menu and the freshness of the ingredients - amazing! What a great way to spend an evening when visiting toronto. Delicious!"}
{"text":"Very nice and cosy place, and also would be a perfect date spot. Our server was very friendly, he helped us pick our meals and  they turned out to be good. The downside is that the server disappeared after bringing our food, so we had to wait for a very long time to get the bill. He didn't refresh our drinks either."}
{"text":"Very well made fresh food. Not cheap but worth it. Everything  from the fresh baked bread to the main course was superb. Would come back."}
{"text":"As the amazing waiter said, this place provides the real food!!
My friend an I came there around 1:30pm at weekday. Only two tables people were having their lunch. We picked a seat near the window but felt a little cold. Then the nice waiter helped us to close the giant window so as to avoid changing seats. The man also know customers' need very well. I just lifted my bottle once and called him, he didn't answer but brought water a few minutes later. Overall, he was very nice and friendly. 

We ordered one lamb stew and daily special. Actually we waited for a really long time and felt a little disappointed. They provided bread and butter before served the main dish. The bread was ok but the real food were their morocco lamb stew and grilled trout. The lamb was so tender and almost fall off the bone. The couscous below mixed with the sauce was full of flavour and so delicious!! Best lamb I ever had! The trout was fresh and grilled till the skin burnt and crispy. Yes. We ate them all!! Maybe we were both too hungry because of waiting till 2:30pm to have lunch. But this place was deserved to go. Nice decorations and reasonable price for their good-quality food."}
{"text":"This is my go-to spot whenever I'm craving duck confit; sits on a bed of delicious mushroom risotto. 

Warming and cozy atmosphere!"}
{"text":"Menu: http://www.theelmtree.ca/dinner_menu

What we had: calamari in ratatouille, pan seared scallops, duck confit with risotto, and stewed lamb shank with couscous, orange cheesecake

Taste: 9.5/10

The pan seared scallops were super tender and juicy, lightly seared on the outside. They were the highlight of our dinner. The calamari was just a grilled calamari (seasoned with just salt) on a bed of ratatouille, did not taste particularly special. The lamb shank was decently flavourful, but it wasn't as tender as I expected. It wasn't dry or tough, but tender is a word we are very conservative about and that lamb was not tender. We ordered it based on raving reviews on Yelp and we conclude that it's decent but not a must-try.  The duck was fried and very crispy on the outside while tender on the inside, delicious.  The risotto was very flavourful, and mixed well with the duck.

The cheesecake was served in a cup where the cream cheese layered with cake pieces.  It was much lighter than a normal cheesecake, but still full of flavour.

Value: 3/10

15$ for the scallops, 10$ for the calamari, 19$ for the duck, 22$ for lamb shank, 8$ for cheesecake.  Unlimited bread and hummus dip.  We were both full after the meal, although we had 2 basket of bread and hummus (which were both excellent). 

**Average cost per diner: 40$ After Tax+Tip

Service/Convenience: 8/10

The place is fairly easy to find. The waiters are generally attentive and timely in bringing the food, water, clean utensils etc. However we asked for warm water and it never came. We made a reservation, it was pretty full throughout our stay there so making a reservation is definitely recommended, especially at peak meal times.

Would go back? Maybe, for special occasions, after we tried some other restaurants.

Would recommend to friend? Yes, just order the scallops. 

Similar places: None that we know of for now

**Disclaimer: Average cost per diner constitutes the amount (per person) we eat to get full without drinks. Total cost is usually divided between 2 diners, one of whom can regularly eat 7 slices of XL pizza (16\") in one sitting."}
{"text":"My boyfriend took me to The Elm Tree Restaurant for dinner. The atmosphere is romantic and classy. Service was excellent - a server would bring out our meals, then our main server came over to tell us the dish ingredients, cooking style etc.

DRINKS:
Sauvignon Blanc, Eradus (for me) - more on the sweeter end, which I preferred. 
Pinot Grigio, Serenissima (bf)

APPETIZERS:
PAN SEARED SCALLOPS (3/5)
(Seasoned with curry salt, green apple purée)
The scallops were seared perfectly - very delicious. Unfortunately, I didn't think the green apple purée was a good match with the scallops.l, it was too sour. 3 points goes to the scallops though!

MAINS:
DUCK CONFIT (4/5)
(With wild mushroom risotto)
Mm the duck confit was delish! The skin was very crispy with just the right amount of fatty and duck meat. The mushroom risotto was also great - it gets salty after a while but still a great mix with the duck leg. 

PAN SEARED CHILEAN SEA BASS (4/5)
(Saffron infused rice, caper meuniere sauce, diced tomato)
For those who would like something more healthy tasting, this is a good choice. A very light dish - the sea bass was tasty and fresh. I enjoyed this dish very much. 

DESSERT: 
TOFFEE CAKE (5/5) 
You would be missing out if you didn't save room for this dessert!! I looooved this toffee cake. So good - there was a crunchy glazed toffee on top of the vanilla ice cream and the toffee cake is at the bottom. I would come back again just to order this dessert. So so yummy, great end to our meal! :)"}
{"text":"Came here for a double date night.  The service was friendly.  Food fresh and tasty.  I don't mind paying for good food and ambience, but I the prices seemed a tad on the higher side with portions being fairly small.  Still a good evening overall, however, and would try it again.  An excellent spot for an intimate evening or special event."}
{"text":"We went there for my husband's birthday. As it was a rainy day, we sat inside which was dark and seemed packed to me. I liked the decoration though. The food was also very good, well-cooked, well-garnished, and in good portion. I didn't like their pasta though, but the daily soup was just great! Our server was OK but made us a bit uncomfortable by standing on top of our table most of the time and rushing us as he wanted to collect the dirty plates. Overall, it was a pleasant experience, and I do recommend this place."}
{"text":"Was terrible, I ordered burger , for some reason they bring salad! They are rude! They don't care about customers at all."}
{"text":"Came here based on the huge Yelp rating... And I'm not quite sure it lived up to the Yelp score.

We tried the following:

Beat and goat cheese salad: A solid salad. Good presentation. Fine flavour.

Pan seared chilean sea bass: the fish tasted good but still felt it lacked something to put into a higher tier

Duck confit: kind of underwhelming, though I'm not sure what could have been done to improve it

Brownie for dessert: amazing brownie, the dessert was excellent. Highly recommend. But I am a huge brownie eater.

Overall, it was a good experience but I don't think I can give it 5/5. Felt like it was missing something to achieve a 5/5."}
{"text":"The Elm Tree is a great addition to the downtown Toronto restaurant scene. It is the perfect blend of everything you can want from a restaurant. Elm Tree offers a great food menu and an extensive selection of alcoholic beverages all at very reasonable prices (especially when considering the area). A must go to for food and drink enthusiasts. Last night was my third visit to the restaurant in the last month and I will definitely be making plans to visit it again in the very new future!"}
{"text":"Very friendly employees. They will have good suggestions on what to eat and drink.  I had the rissotto wirh duck, very savory. Located in downtown, a confortable walking distance from any hotel."}
{"text":"I ordered a seafood orzo pasta dish for 18 dollars
 
2 shrimps. 2 scallops.  No mussels no calamari no nothing.  Just 2 shrimps and 2 measley scallops.

Suffice it to say impressed I was not.

Although they were cooked properly I couldn't get over the stinginess.

Also I noticed the wines were extremely over priced at 50 dollars a bottle minimum and glasses at 14 bucks.

Better value could definitely be found elsewhere and why this place has 5 stars is a mystery to me

Oh and I might add that to top it off the waiter was quite rude.

I guess it just wasn't meant to be."}
{"text":"Amazing food, quick and polite service. I'm definitely coming back with the entire family!"}
{"text":"Solid joint. Nice atmosphere. Ordered the lamb shank and Cornish hen. Both were missing a kick

Hey Jonathan! 

I visited last night! Your concern is much appreciated. I will be back and try something else. The food was great, but I guess was in the mood for something spicy. 

Thanks for your concern!

Sumit."}
{"text":"Hmmm looking for another spot to eat and took out thee trusty Yelp app and SCORE! BAM! POW!  We have a winner.  Yelp does it again!

I'd be lying if I didn't say that the drink menu didn't bring us out, as soon as we saw the list of bourbon, we knew that we had a winner.  

Alright, beautiful restaurant, with nice, outdoor seating.  Quaint in the interior, but nice indeed.  

You are initially presented with a bread basket with an hummus/olive spread.  Just divine.  

For dinner I had the pasta of the day, the tagliatelle seafood,  which was basically a seafood pasta in a rose sauce.  

The portion was nicely sized, and there was plenty of seafood; shrimp, salmon, scallop to go around.  For dessert I tried the pear and the spiced cake. 

The poached pear came over a mascarpone cheese that was spiced and I believe also had saffron.  The presentation of the plate was awesome, the pear tasted great; although, I do not believe that the mascarpone and the pear were a good mix with one another.  I kind of preferred the mascarpone with the cake.  It really added a nice creamy mix to the cake.  

The staff was awesome, knowledgable and accommodating.   Another winner."}
{"text":"Definitely not going here again! This place is so overrated including the food, prices and the service. The food that we ordered was just mediocre nothing exceptional or inviting. The menu didn't have a good variety to choose from. I'm not sure how other people find this place above average."}
{"text":"Loved the menu, the service and the ambiance!   Stumbled upon it while on a business trip and decided to take a chance.   So glad I did!  Got seated with a colleague about the same time as a large party, so we were worried about service and noise, but the staff was great and noise was not a factor.  Our server was appropriately attentive and very knowledgeable about the menu.  The lamb shank was one of the best preparations I have ever had and the portions are very reasonable.   I will look forward to coming back to Toronto to dine here again!"}
{"text":"I absolutely recommend The Elm Tree to everyone! :)
The food is absolutely incredible, I had the Chilean Sea Bass, and it was amazing. The menu is incredible and the food presentation is extremely sophisticated.
I loved the customer service, everyone was friendly and approachable.
I will definitely visit again."}
{"text":"free bread is good. does not see any Mediterranean feature food. ordered the duck confit which had a few good reviews on yelp. However it is very oily, heavy flavor, made you sick after eating half dish. other food like sandwich and burgers do seem like a regular bar food type."}
{"text":"The wife and I went there for dinner this evening.  I had the crispy hen.  It was absolutely amazing.  Also,  the wine was delicious and the service was absolutely excellent.  Definitely recommended."}
{"text":"We visited the Elm Tree for our one year wedding anniversary.  Overall, we had a great experience.

We started with the beef carpaccio, which was perfectly tender.  Our mains were the Duck on Mushroom Risotto and the special: Arctic Char on Potatoes.  I'm not usually a huge fan of risotto, but I think this converted me - the mushrooms were delicious and plentiful, and the risotto was creamy and not over done.  The duck was a little over salty for me, especially since the risotto was also very flavourful as well - it would have been better paired with a less rich flavour in the meat.  My husband's Char was delicious, but on the same size portion wise.

We each decided to go for dessert. I had the chocolate mousse and my husband had the toffee cake, which came with vanilla ice cream.  Both were delicious and very large portions (we packed it home).  I am a huge chocolate lover but I do feel like the mousse could have been better served in a smaller portion with wafers or something to break up the chocolate a bit.

The one major disappointment was that there was nothing special done for our anniversary.  I was surprised that there was no complimentary wine or desserts.  A bit more of a personal touch on a quiet night in the restaurant would have gone a long way, especially as we were celebrating a special occasion."}
{"text":"A delicious fusion food restaurant with a cozy vibe and friendly staff! Highly recommend the Creme Brulee for dessert!!!"}
{"text":"The patio is great for people watching and the food is pretty good, but maybe a bit pricier than it needs to be. I really enjoyed my salmon but wasn't overly thrilled with the fried cauliflower or the buratta. It's a nice place to check out if you're in the area and the weather is good, but I wouldn't go out of my way to come back here."}
{"text":"Food is great.  The risotto is excellent, a must try.  Unfortunately, the server was being too pushy and forcing us to order app while waiting for a friend to come.   The server had a bad attitude towards us.  Once he knew we weren't ordering more, he toss us the bill.  We just ignore him and continue our conversation.  The restaurant weren't even full.  We like to take our time with dinner and have conversation.  I don't like being rush through dinner.  When we did want to leave and pay, we couldn't get the server attention.  I wouldn't come back for the reason of the service here."}
{"text":"Came here with a work colleague for a quick dinner. we were greeted with a friendly waiter who showed us to a table immediately. 

The menu isn't exceptionally large but a good selection. 

We both ordered a steak. It was a piece of good quality meat. I liked but it is not my favorite. They also don't offer any sauces or condiments for the steak. a bit disappointing as I am used to having mushroom or red wine jus back home.

Not a bad place. It had great atmosphere and very friendly staff."}
{"text":"Unfortunately our second visit was not the same experience as the first.  Decent food muddled by a waiter with attitude spoiled a nice evening out for our group.  Maybe the positive reviews got to their head....

(Update a day after)
Reflecting a day later, I'm still in shock at the experience.  The waiter literally mocked one of the participants in front of the group.  He gave attitude the whole night.  And he charged people water when they didn't have any, or when they asked for \"regular water\".  Just a huge disappointment."}
{"text":"What a hidden gem!  The Elm Street is a beautiful spot and the staff is warm and welcoming. Food is amazing and fresh."}
{"text":"The waiters and waitresses are SUPER nice and friendly. Owner is REALLY REALLY nice too. Food is fantastic. Best place to be for special occasions!!"}
{"text":"Loved this spot last time we were in Toronto. We went for a business outing and had no issues making a reservation. I would suggest you reserve because the place fills up. 

Great ambiance in the restaurant. Be careful with Google Maps - the address was listed as Elm Street only, so it doesn't actually get you to the restaurant. We told the host and he said they requested the change, so hopefully it is fixed. 

We split a ton of appetizers and the highlights were the cauliflower and the burrata. I got the duck breast for my entree and it was delicious! I wasn't crazy about the endive side, but that is just because I don't love endives. 

We split the Nutella cheesecake and creme brûlée for dessert. 

Everything was so tasty. Great wine selection as well!"}
{"text":"Elm tree had amazing ambience, courteous service, and decadent food at a steal of a price!!

We had the scallops for appetizer and it was perfectly seared and paired with a fruity sauce. 

For our entrees, we tried the duck confit and Chilean sea bass! Duck confit came with perfect al dante risotto. It's not everyday that you see Chilean sea bass on the menu so it's a must try!

Dessert was also superb. We had the poached whole pear with mascarpone cheese and cream brûlée. Poached pear was the highlight! They also offer sticky toffee pudding which will be tried next time. 

Overall, the great decor, gorgeous plating, and flavour profiles are all reasons why we'll be going back for more soon!"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I went to elm tree for date night and had the risotto with duck and salmon. It was all very good, but a tad too rich for my taste. The salmon was in a heavy cream sauce. Personally I like don't like heavy cream in my food. That being said, the chef did a really good job of making the food taste good. The service was also excellent!!"}
{"text":"UPDATE: We had the NY Steak and a second helping of the burger. Unreal. So good. Add the Manhattan and the ginger Cosmo and this place is a legit foodie experience. The servers are great, the management is friendly and it's a great way to spend time out.

Tip: The front is best for quiet dates."}
{"text":"Attentive awesome service and every bite was flavorful and amazing. The filet mignon cooked rare was a glorious experience. Just fantastic af."}
{"text":"Very great value for the prices. Portions are large. Everything was quite good - the hummus app was great. I enjoyed the risotto. The fish was not as soft as I would have liked it but the atmosphere and service was great. Would come back."}
{"text":"We came to this Restuarant because it was outside the doorsteps of our hotel and I was just too tired to walk to restuarant- what an unbelievable surprise- this was one of the best meals I have had anywhere . I had their special- a seafood stew and my son had their lamb shank- both dish were delicious !!!
For dessert we shared a creme brûlée . I highly recommend this place- the atmosphere was quiet and the service was impeccable!"}
{"text":"The best appetizers! Mediterranean scallops and octopus and Greek salad! Perfect sizes for two eating light at night. Lovely small neighborhood place. Excellent service! Visiting from California.  Not good for kids and a little noisy due to size."}
{"text":"Made a reservation for ~6:45pm on a Friday and the restaurant was surprisingly only half full. The entrance of this place reminds me a lot of the restaurants in downtown Montreal. Inside, it's dim, mellow, and calm.

We were first served with bread and some hummus. I personally love hummus but I know plenty who don't, such as my friend who came with me. Would have been nice if we were offered butter or some other choices.

We ordered a cocktail (gin and cucumber), lamb shank, and cornish hen. Hands down the most amazing cornish hen I've ever had. The skin was crispy and flavourful, the meat was tender and juicy. Vegetables provided on the side were delicous too. I loved dipping the hen into the sauce on the plate. Friend's feedback on the lamb was 2.5/5. I tried a piece and agreed with him too. It tasted like any other lamb dish you find at a decent restaurant, nothing stood out. The size of the food is definitely reasonable for what you pay. Both of us could not finish our food.

Also, I loved the cocktail! 

Service was good, we never had to ask for our water to be refilled. Our server came around every 10-15 minutes.

The restaunt was quickly filled with people at around 7:30pm. Great spot for a date night!! Would be back again for other cocktails and the cornish hen."}
{"text":"This place was absolutely excellent.  We were walking around Downtown Toronto looking for a place to eat and the hostess greeted us as we were passing by.  We checked out the menu and the owner came out to show us our table.  The waiter was very patient as we could not decide what to eat.  He pointed out dishes that other patrons had ordered and we saw that they looked very good.  We finally decided on the Oven Backed European Sea Bass which was one of the dishes he recommended.  Wow!  We both ordered the same thing and agreed that it was amazing!  The service was good and the food was as well.  The owner seemed very involved with the operations and the entire staff was accommodating.  I will definitely be back.  Everything was just perfect at this restaurant.  So glad that we walked off the main road and wandered here."}
{"text":"My wife and I found this place on Yelp and since it was close to our hotel, we decided to try it! We had reservations but got there early looking to have a drink at the bar. Unfortunately there was a private party going on in the bar area so we decided to be seated early. The waiter was very friendly and attentive. After ordering drinks, we placed our order. My wife started with the octopus as an appetizer which she loved.  It was tender and not over cooked! I ordered the Barramundi for my dinner and she ordered the beef carpaccio. Both turned out very good! What a nice atmosphere. We'd recommend this place. Thought the price of the meal was reasonable for the quality of food!"}
{"text":"We went to the Elm Tree restaurant for Friday dinner. The Elm Tree restaurant is located on Elm off Bay Street. It is beautifully decorated restaurant and the staff was friendly and professional.

I ordered the fried cauliflower as an appetizer. It was delicious and I enjoyed it. I ordered the lamb shank for my main dish. I enjoyed it.

Would I go back to the Elm Tree Restaurant? Yes, since the food was very good and the service was excellent."}
{"text":"I am a big fan of risottos, and one of my secret food missions is to find the best risotto ever. I would say that The Elm Tree Restaurant's mushroom risotto did not disappoint! 

From reading the reviews on Yelp, I came into the restaurant set on ordering risotto. However, their menu had a few items that also sounded attractive. My boyfriend studied the menu for quite a bit, but also set his mind on the risotto. Usually I prefer if we order two different things so we could have a taste of both, but this time I knew I didn't wanna share my risotto, so I didn't mind him ordering his own. Once the food came, I knew I was right. The risotto was the perfect amount of creaminess, so fragrant and all the ingredients were infused into the rice. The pieces of duck confit gave the overall dish a good texture. Each bite was so flavourful and perfect. 

For what you pay for, the portion size was decent, I was full and satisfied. The ambiance of the restaurant was great, perfect for a date night. I would definitely return to try other items on the menu, if I could resist the risotto next time!"}
{"text":"SO LET ME TELL YOU A STORY ABOUT THIS RESTAURANT STEALING OUR FOOD. We went there for a friend's birthday. Our cake had decorations on top with several cream puffs in the middle. While they were serving the cake slices, we noticed our decorations were all gone  While we were wondering where they went, a friend saw them eat the cream puffs in the kitchen LOLOL so when we asked them the whereabouts of cream buffs, they lied to us saying that they threw them out because apparently they didn't think they were \"edible\"  which is shocking considering the fact that we saw them eat them  all they did to compensate was to take the cake cutting fee out which doesn't justify the fact that they TOOK OUR FOOD? AND ATE IT? AND LIED TO US? I just can't believe something this unprofessional could happen at a such well known restaurant. Please dear manager, feed your workers so they won't steal from the customers. Oh yeah never going back again for obvious reasons."}
{"text":"Love this place!
My husband and I decided to try another restaurant on Elm St. I'm so glad we picked this place. The restaurant is nice, open and airy, not cluttered at all.  The staff was friendly and attentive. 
They had their specials but we opted to try what was on their menu. The dishes we ordered were all delicious.
We were served with complimentary bread, olive tapenade and lemon water. The bread and tapenade was addictive. They gave us a second round of bread. 
For our appetizer, we ordered the grilled octopus and ratatouille. The octopus was grilled perfectly. It wasn't chewy or rubbery and good enough to cut with a fork. 
Our entrees were the duck confit with mushroom risotto and braised Moroccan style lamb shank. Both dishes were delicious and flavourful. 
We didn't have any room for dessert but we'll save some room for next time. 
We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Wonderful meal here! The waiters Leif and Miran were awesome - spot on descriptions and suggestions including a perfect wine match! We had the arugula mushroom salad to start - delightful with grilled mushrooms topped with a bed of arugula and shaved Parmesan cheese and dressed in a very light but tasty vinaigrette. The rack of lamb on a bed of mashed potatoes were delicious - the duck confit over mushroom risotto was amazing with crispy duck skin and oh so tender duck. The chick peas with sweet potatoes and harissa were outstanding! Portions are very generous - great to share things so you can try many different things. The homemade chickpea spread with the baguette that is given to you at the start of your meal is terrific as well! Definitely will put this on my list of must return to places!!"}
{"text":"This place was way better than what we expected. It's probably one the best places we've ate in a while and the prices are not ridiculous. Must haves: the octopus appetizers and salmon dish. I would definitely come back here again!"}
{"text":"I was here for a friends birthday. I had the Grilled Salmon... it was cooked very well, portion size for me was a bit much but for the average Joe it would be perfect.

Complimentary bread and olive tapinade were delicious. 

Service was superb.

The vibe was comfortable and on a really cool street I didn't really know existed"}
{"text":"As a local, I have always avoided restaurants that are fairly close to hotels just on the basis that it \"might\" be an overpriced tourist trap, and hence avoided the area around Elm street. Luckily, a food event brought me to The Elm Tree Restaurant, and I have to say I am a fan of this place!

For our dinner, we had a sampling of their winter menu dishes, so we had smaller portions that usual (so ignore the portion size of my pictures). They are now at their Spring menu, but some items will probably still be there.

- Pan Seared Scallop: This was perfectly seared and scallop was not overdone. The sunflower seed pesto was great with it, as is the confit tomato.

- Beef Carpaccio: This is a great starter and I loved the truffle oil with the beef.

- Grilled octopus: I tend to be picky about octopus and hate it when it is not done right. I am happy to say it was quite well done here. Love the giant caper berries and the chorizo salsa with it.

- Pork belly: This item has all the other reviews raving about and I can see why. Pork belly needs to be tender to be good and this one is tender! It comes with sauerkraut which is not my favourite, but a good dish nonetheless.

- Cornish hen: While not an overly photogenic dish, it is quite decent and I like the roasted brussels sprouts that came with it

- Duck breast: This dish was a slight miss for me. While the duck breast is perfectly cooked (pink in centre) and has great flavours with the pistachio rumble and duck jus, the cut of the breast was not good and there was a hard ligament within the meat. It took us a bit of effort to chew. YMMV on this one.

- Herb crusted rack of lamb: This was my favourite dish. I loved the combination of the lamb and herb crust, and the parsnip puree was so good with it!

Overall, I really liked The Elm Tree Restaurant and the prices are not too bad considering the location (Yonge and Dundas very close to Eaton Centre and TTC; $20 to high 30's for mains). I think this is a great dining option in the very competitive downtown Toronto scene."}
{"text":"Being Asian I have been to sooo many Asian restaurants. Chinese Japanese Korean to name a few. To be able to try something new to my palate is soooo great . This place I think is an absolute  must try ! The taste of the dishes are very simple and refreshing from the Asian food. The hubby had the Gruyere Burger and he loved it , I had the porkChop and I loved it. Though the price was a bit more than your usual dinner fare, with the quality I would come back. First time I tried porkchop cut so thick that I doubted i'd be able to chew (i have real teeth that have seemingly dentures characteristics) , surprisingly the chops were sooo tender and juicy . I will go back and try their other fares . Oh and I almost forgot to mention the ambience and service !! Definitely good, both for going with friends or on a date . From the looks of it they also seem to have a good wine menu. 6thumbs up !"}
{"text":"Must try: Duck Confit with Mushroom Risotto

The atmosphere was relaxing, with the rustic lightbulbs and shimmery candles. Not to mention the pillows!! Adorable touch. It's good for larger parties (I saw many long tables) as well as a nice date night. 

The service was pleasant. Our waiter was lively and conversational. One thing that almost soured my mood was how his tone and facial expression would change when he heard that some of my party didn't want an app but instead a drink, or that two of us wanted to share an app instead of getting one each. Cmon sir, not all customers go for the traditional full courses, especially on a weekend when they just wanna loosen up and not bother with the formality, you just gotta roll with the punches. But this was immediately redeemed when he took the effort to ask the kitchen to modify a dish for my friend's picky taste bud. Kudos to going out of the way to accommodate!

The food was wonderful! I definitely enjoyed it from start to finish. The (1) bread with baba ganoush was great, I could just eat that as a meal! Wish the bread was warmer though. I also tried the (2) Grill Octopus to start and it had a good texture and interesting flavouring. The highlight was without a doubt the (3) Duck Confit with Mushroom Risotto, with the crispy skin and tender juicy meat on top of a bed of wild mushroom infused rice. I don't usually order risotto but this is decidedly going to change my mind in the future. It was perfectly al dente, buttery but light; and complemented the duck perfectly until the last bite. I will definitely crave this. 

Will definitely come back, and will make sure to not be too stuffed for dessert.

{"text":"Nice ambiance and very affordable mains. The waiter was nice and serviced our group of 8 efficiently. However, the interactions were kind of off and he didn't seem to take allergies and vegetarian inquiries seriously. 

We got the lamb shank and mushroom risotto.

Lamb Shank
- seems to be a hit or miss but I personally really didn't like it
- don't get this if you're not a fan of sweet meat
- the lamb did not have a lamb taste at all or any other flavour; it was really bland

Mushroom Risotto
- this was great but slightly on the salty side

Overall, I was let down given the great reviews here but would give it another shot and try some other things on the menu."}
{"text":"Elm Street is a charming street with a few nice restaurants, all with outdoor seating.  We choose to eat at Elm Tree because the owner greeted us as we walked by and told us we would not be disappointed and we weren't.  

I had the Cornish Hen and it was cooked perfectly and had great flavor.  The lamb shank did not disappoint and the beef tenderloin was good.  My friend wanted it cooked medium rare and Miran, our waiter, talked her into getting it cooked medium and she regretted it.  Apparently Canadian's are afraid of under cooked meat. 

We dined there the day after my birthday and dessert was a gift from Miran.  Thank you.

This was one of the best meals we had in Toronto."}
{"text":"By far, the best meal I have had in Toronto since this summer. 

If you have not been to Elm Tree Restaurant yet, I implore you to make a trip this weekend. It's located right near Bay and Elm Street, snug in the row of restaurants. It's hard to peer into the restaurant if you were just walking by, and to be honest, if not for the Yelp reviews I probably wouldn't have ever eaten here.

The modern-Mediterranean restaurant is family run and the servers are very friendly and accommodating. A true 5 stars for service, which unfortunately is quite rare in Toronto. The servers were very attentive and showed a genuine interest in ensuring our dining experience was perfect. 

Dinner starts out with complimentary homemade bread with garlic and olive oil. Bread is really well done and the dip was extremely fresh and fragrant. 

The Braised Moroccan Style Lamb Shank was almost ungodly delicious. Very tender, intricately flavourful: a non-ending mouthful of goodness. The lamb also came with couscous, carrots, onions and dried figs. 

I also tried their Pork Chop with fingerling potatoes confit in duct fat, sautéed oyster king and button mushrooms with madeira sauce. Once again, absolutely impeccably made. 

I couldn't recommend this restaurant enough! Prices are fair, around the $30 range. 
For its affordability and quality of food, the Elm Tree Restaurant really puts all other fine dining restaurants to shame in the neighbourhood."}
{"text":"Best salmon ever! Tender, juicy, great balance of taste. Hen is good too, could be better if there was less chicken :p"}
{"text":"3.5 stars for me. Everything was good but not mind blowing.
I finally tried this place after seeing stellar yelp ratings.

I had a Duck Confit main dish for lunch. The wild mushroom risotto was super delicious! I didn't enjoy the duck piece as much. It was dry and a little burnt. I didn't like fat parts so I only ate what looked to me to be meat. That may have been how the duck was supposed to be cooked but I like my meat juicy and tender.

The atmosphere is warm with wooden chairs and creme-coloured walls. The service was good. The waiter, though he was the only one working at the time we were there, was attentive. There are a couple of coat racks."}
{"text":"What a lovely place!  Decided to book this place last minute on Valentine's day. My husband and I don't usually celebrate this event but thought it was nice to spend the evening out since my parents decided to take the grandkids out for dinner.  The only time left for 2 on OpenTable was at 5:45pm.  The place was pretty full and by the time we finished around 7:30pm the place was completely packed.  It was really by fluke that I picked this place that had the perfect ambiance for a romantic dinner....dim lightings and soft music.

The menu was a simple 1 pager, easy to read and great options on the starters and mains.  Everything listed on the starters sound amazing.  We decided to go with the Carrot Ginger Soup and the Charred Octopus to start....WOW..these were delicious.  For mains, my husband got the mushroom risotto with duck confit and I got the Tile Fish.  We were also very pleased with our dishes.

We were really happy to discover this wonderful place and we'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"Came here around dinner time, didn't book ahead of time and this was the only place that was able to accommodate all of us!
I didn't expect much even though the review was pretty good, however, all of the appetizers surprised me! We had eggplant, cauliflower and sweet bread which were all very delicious! Would definitely recommend!
Side note: sweet bread is not actually bread but meat! (Maybe I'm the only one who didn't know?)
Speaking of the main course, I had the lamb shank which was pretty good. The portion of it varies, I got a huge one  and I tried very hard to finish it but my friend got a relatively small one. Maybe we should've exchanged our plate lol

In general, would recommend their appetizer a lot! (Also their freshly baked bread was sooo good!)"}
{"text":"Incredible meal.  Would recommend to anyone.
My family (13 of us) ate here and everyone enjoyed their meals immensely."}
{"text":"I came the The Elm Tree for a celebration dinner with my boyfriend. We had made reservations but still had to wait about 20 minutes.. slightly annoying, but fine. We were seated and shared the beef tartare which was yummy but I think the tarragon really threw me off.. my own fault. I got the beef tenderloin and my boyfriend got the rack of lamb. The tenderloin was great although the lamb was a bit over cooked. We also shared a side of seasoned potato wedges which weren't impressive nor dissapointing. The nutella cheesecake however is absolutely delicious and a must try, even if you don't have much of a sweet tooth. Overall I think that the food is good especially for the price, our server was great, and dessert brought this from a 3 to a 4 Star review."}
{"text":"Very good lamb. Bold Moroccan flavours.  Friendly staff. Really good meal.  Came in because the other restaurants in the area were full. No regrets."}
{"text":"My friends were excited to try this place so we went. Small intimate atmosphere. Appetizers were ok. Small portions and pricey. The lamb shank was good, duck leg was okay, and stone bass is not good. We were 5 ladies and the bill came out to $400 before taxes. Menu has limited items and wine list was mediocre. don't need to try this place again. for the same price there are more options in the city."}
{"text":"The duck confit is their specialty, you must get it. It's a smaller portion but it was extremely tasty. I asked for my duck to be extra crispy and they delivered. The crunch was a perfect compliment to the risotto.

The rib eye sandwich is a really good portion, it came to the table and everyone was eyeing my friend's ribeye. The fries were good and I tried the sandwich and it was good too. Nothing memorable though, still preferred my duck confit.

Another friend got the orzo pasta. It was alright for $18. Still preferred my duck confit. My risotto was so much better than his orzo pasta and I got a duck on top of it. Very little seafood in it too. 

A shared app was the beef carpaccio. Extremely tasty! Amazing appetizer, glad we got it. I'm sure it's an acquired taste for people who aren't accustomed to eating raw meat. But it's the same as sushi to me - glad I got to try it.

Apart from the beef carpaccio, the restaurant also offered some sort of pâté ?? as a complimentary pre-dish. The table was unsure what it was, we assumed it was a beef pâté served with some good bread. But honestly it tasted more like an olive pâté. Way too much olive taste, but hey if you like olives! 

I'm not a beer fanatic but thee general consensus on the Hopcity Hopbot IPA was two thumbs up! Not a fan of the beer but I could at least describe it as having a strong floral taste? I hope that paints your imagination and feel free to try it, wasn't my cup of tea but everyone else loved it.

That atmosphere was lovely, the washrooms were clean, the service was wonderful and despite going with a big crowd for a going away party (15 people) - our waitress handled us perfectly. It was a good size place and we didn't feel like we overpowered the rest of the diners."}
{"text":"In Toronto with my Fiancés family and we were searching for a place close to our hotel. We found the Elm Tree and had just about the best meal we could have imagined while in Toronto. First off, service was fantastic, we were seated right away and we met by a friendly server. The menu isn't large but the choices had our mouths watering, I would recommend the Beef Carpaccio to start and the Duck Confit for dinner. They have a great beer menu and drink menu and everything is reasonably priced. One of us wanted Scallops for dinner, an appetizer that normally costs $15, the waiter agreed to double the order for meal without blinking an eye. No one had a single complaint the meals were brought out in a timely fashion, the other servers were fun to speak to and on top of everything. Lets not forget dessert, they don't have a dessert menu because it changes frequently. They had a number of delicious options including a very interesting Orange cheesecake and a sticky toffee pudding cake that was incredible. We will absolutely be returning when we come back to Toronto."}
{"text":"Beautiful restaurant and great food. I had the pasta of the day which was simple yet very tasty."}
{"text":"For a beautiful September Friday night, this restaurant was surprisingly NOT packed. Much appreciated as a diner without a reservation, but curious because I had such a great experience here!

The atmosphere is set for intimate dining, filled with ambient lighting and throw cushions against the upholstered booths. I think the ambiance could be improved on if the candles were a BIT brighter, but the effect was there

Bread was served first with some hummus with olive oil - very nice indeed, and the hummus was delicious.

My girl friend and I ordered a glass of wine each, and tried the duck confit with mushroom risotto ($19). What I like about this dish is that a lot of restaurants will serve you the risotto on its own entree, but here you get to try both the excellent (succulent and crispy skin) duck AND the risotto. I love this dish, it's fantastic! My friend got the braised Moroccan style lamb shank with couscous ($22) and found that it was intensely flavourful. This may be the style of the dish, but we were simply downing bread with this dish to disperse some of the flavour.

I'll have to return again to try their desserts! Definitely warrants a return trip!"}
{"text":"Located right in the downtown core. Make sure you make reservations because this place fills up fast. The wait staff was especially patient with us as not all of our party arrived on time for our reservation but we were able to keep our table. The ambiance was nice with paintings everywhere and candles lite throughout. They mentioned that they change their menu 4 times a year to keep things interesting.

We came for dinner. There was an extensive drinks menu. The waiter was good at recommending many drinks that weren't on the menu. A bunch of us ordered red wine sangrias that were also not on the menu. Unfortunately, they tasted like watered down wine with a few pieces of citrus in them. Would not recommend. 

I ordered the lamb shank after reading a bunch of reviews and the creamy sweet potato was delicious and texture was contrasted by the crunchy quinoa. The lamb was perfectly tender without being dry. The pine nuts were sadly stale and took away from the pleasure of the dish. The lamb was a good portion but the rest of the plate was not very filling.

Luckily they don't charge mandatory gratuity on groups greater than 6 and were accommodating to separating the bills."}
{"text":"Nice atmosphere here and good service. 
We ordered the lamb shank and sea bass fish with the nutella cheesecake as our dessert. Both the entrees were delicious, nicely flavoured. The lamb was tender while the sea bass was pan-seared with a nice crispy side. The cheesecake was average - it would've been better if there was a little scoop of ice-cream on the side.

We would come visit again. The entire meal was around $75 which was at a good price, we were definitely satisfied."}
{"text":"Came here for a friend's birthday and the place was pretty packed. We had to wait a bit even with reservations but the service provided was impeccable. As we were waiting, the owner (I believe) came to apologise for the wait with a bottle of champagne.

The food was also delicious, I regretted not getting a fancier dish since I had just eaten before dinner but the smoked cheddar burger was well cooked and juicy. My fiancee also had the wild mushroom risotto which was so excellent that it rivalled my own (lol).

All in all, great food, great experience, great service, and great dining."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I ate here our first night in Toronto, 8/30/14. We had a wonderful meal. I ordered the orzotto, he had the risotto. The flavors were amazing in both dishes. The scallops and shrimp in my dish were perfectly cooked and seasoned. I can't wait to come back to Toronto for another great meal!"}
{"text":"Spanish music played in this Mediterranean restaurant with simple decor. It's an open area with some large tables for intimate group dinner. 

The basement washroom was surprisingly bright, clean, spacious and had a nice colour on the wall. 

I ordered a burger which I mentioned \"no cheese\" and it came with it!!! No apologies but they wanted to take it back. I didn't want to eat at a different time than my friend so I waited until it was a bit cold and peeled it off the burger. For a high end place, they used iceberg lettuce which wasn't appealing. The bun was toasted and soft which was nice. The fries was thrown unto the plate instead of placing it nicely into another small plate or container. 

My friend ordered the Cornish hen and it was nicely displayed. More veggies would have been nice. I'm glad she liked it since my hamburger was okay. Not great!

Service was mediocre. My friend's water was not refilled at all.

Verdict: I probably won't go back. Good thing I didn't have allergies since they can't even accommodate to the customer's order."}
{"text":"The food was amazing, service was really good. Ambiance was nice and calming. I highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"Great place to meet friends or take a date. Great atmosphere for socializing. It's dimly lit but not dark and the music is good but not loud. You can have a conversation. The service was really good and our server was attentive and helpful. The menu is Mediterranean and not overly complicated. The food is really good but simple. Most of their sauces were sweet which was a little different for Mediterranean food but somehow it worked. The food may not be for traditionalists. It gets busy but clears out fairly quickly. Got the feeling it was a tourist spot because you'll see many Americans sitting around in track pants and hoodies which is totally fine. Kind of weird for higher end dining but I love that vibe. Food and drinks might seem pricey but the prices won't shock a foodie. Overall I can definitely recommend Elm Tree if you're out and about on Yonge Street after finishing a day of shopping."}
{"text":"Awesome service :)  We went for dinner, our waitress was very friendly and helpful. The burger with eggplant was delicious, my friend had the scallops (appetizer) and reported it was scrumptious! Great wine selection. Would absolutely go back again."}
{"text":"I was taken here for our anniversary and it was such a good find! To be honest, this restaurant had never been on my radar before - there isn't much hype around it and I don't think it's on a lot of Toronto hot spot lists. But Sweetheart seems to use different restaurant finding techniques/tools than I do, and I'm very glad he he came across this place.

When we walked in, I thought the ambience was nice. Simply decorated, cozy, and comfortable. We were also welcomed particularly warmly because the person working the front turned out to be one of Sweetheart's countrymen. 

(Again) To be honest, I wasn't super excited when I first looked at the menu - there wasn't anything I was particularly interested in. I ended up choosing the barramundi with chraime, eggplant, lemon, and a bunch of herbs. I think Sweetheart had the lamb shank, but I don't remember for sure. We shared the fried cauliflower for our appetizer and we shared brussels sprouts as a side. 

Everything was delicious. The cauliflower was really refreshing - not heavy or greasy at all even though it was fried. The barramundi far exceeded my expectations. I vaguely knew that chraime was a spiced tomatoey sauce and I was a little worried at first that it might overpower the fish but it actually complemented it perfectly. I normally don't love peppers but the spices went perfectly with the cooked bell peppers and made them surprisingly delicious. I think the fennel took away the flavour I normally dislike from bell peppers. The citrusy/fennelly sauce was also rather refreshing. The brussels sprouts were slightly charred/very caramelized and went great with the citrusy accompaniments. The portions were very good - generous without being excessive. 

I'd be happy to return!"}
{"text":"I'm pretty sure this is the best piece of meat I've ever put in my mouth. 
Got:
House white wine. Delish. Sweet.
Greek salad, sans onion and added chicken breast. Amazing. Chicken falls apart succulently, perfectly dressed. 
Bread with a olive dip

We walked onto the patio, super underdressed, and the waitress was still wonderful and very cool. Will definitely be here again."}
{"text":"Thoroughly enjoyed our meal here. We were seated in the patio on the street and the whole atmoshpere felt very Mediterranean. Service was fast and friendly would recommend to anyone."}
{"text":"I was not very satisfied with my experience with the restaurant considering how good the reviews were. The food here was just not that great for me, and we had an awkward encounter with one of the waiters. 

The waiter who served us was very nice. He was attentive and checked up on us often during our meal. My friend and I were looking at the menu, and decided that we would order the duck confit and lamb shank for our mains and share the beef carpaccio for starters. While looking at the menu and waiting for our waiter to take our orders, a different waiter came to us and randomly said \"duck confit and lamb shank\". At first we were confused as to what was going on. I thought he overheard us talking about what we were going to order. For about a second or so both my friend and I stared at him with confusion. Then he said \"Do you guys even understand English?\". We then both looked at each other with more confusion and we were both speechless and did not know how to reply to that question...Then he proceed to say \"Duck confit and lamb shank is what I recommend.\" Then we suddenly realized what he was talking about and he walked away. We then both stared at each other again with the \"what just happened\" look. We thought it was kind of rude of him to ask us if we understood English - he probably asked that because we weren't Caucasian. But anyways, that didn't really affect our experience at the restaurant...I'm sure he didn't mean to be offensive.

The appetizer was my favourite part of the meal. The beef carpaccio melted in my mouth and the flavours from the dressing, cheese, and arugula salad all blended well nicely together. The main course was what I was disappointed in. The lamb shank was nicely cooked but the whole dish lacked flavour and tasted boring. I love lamb, and the 'lamb' taste from the meat just wasn't really there. The duck confit was also quite disappointing. The meat was dry on the outside and was quite salty. Again, it also lacked flavours. The risotto was nice and creamy but the whole dish just did not go very well together.

As we left the restaurant, we were greeted again by that water who randomly came to talk to us. He said \"you guys ordered what I recommended so I don't know why it was so awkward when I went to talk to you guys.\" My friend explained that he came to us out of no where and we just got confused. Then he proceeded to tell us that it is his job to talk to other people as he is in the service industry. I mean I understand that but I just wished he could of approached us differently. 

Overall I didn't have the best experience at this restaurant. It seemed like a lot of other people really enjoyed the duck and lamb dishes in the reviews but both my friend and I were pretty disappointed with it."}
{"text":"duck confit is a must try. like other review, it's very good.
our server was very funny and their orange cheesecake was in a cup which i never tried before."}
{"text":"The server was friendly but managed to get everything wrong.  We also had to request things multiple times.  The hostess did a great job trying to fix the situation.  The food was good but all we remember was how bad our server was."}
