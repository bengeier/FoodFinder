{"text":"Guys this place rocks. Can't say enough good things about the food, service, and prices. I always get either the teriyaki chicken or hibachi chicken. Def worth it!!!"}
{"text":"Don't waste your time. Overpriced low quality hibachi. You can tell from the moment you walk in (cardboard handwritten signs screaming no return/ not responsible for food issues) that maybe you should turn around and leave. I however made the mistake of staying. I purchased the beef teriyaki combo (which was rung up wrong and had to be fixed after I waited for my food for 20 mins). The beef was over cooked and too lightly sauced, the rice was bland and carrots overcooked into mush. Not worth the stomach ache I had the rest of the day."}
{"text":"This is probably my favorite restaurant. They give you a ton of food and the price is great. I took my boyfriend, who is allergic to mushrooms, and they put mushrooms on his plate by mistake. Instead of just picking them out they re-made the whole dish. The staff is super friendly and the food is always amazing. My boyfriend and I go at least once a week!"}
{"text":"Great lunch spot! The food is delicious and quickly made. The portions are large and the price is fair. Definitely will return :)"}
{"text":"Pedestrian stir-frys you can make at home. Chicken was over-cooked. Sweet tea had an off taste. Service was friendly."}
{"text":"Pretty good hibatchi! Not exactly like I used to but a good replacement being relatively new to the area!"}
{"text":"Been here a few times over the years and the food keeps getting worse and worse. Today was my last time. Rice overcooked into a mushy paste. Rubbery overcooked chicken. The \"scallops\" were definitely NOT scallops rather looked and tasted like little crumbles of white fish. Carrots tasted and looked like baby food. Terrible does not begin to describe our meal."}
{"text":"My boyfriend came with me to eat but was not eating. It took 20 minutes for my plate to come out. In the meantime I drank all of my Coke, when I went to ask for a refill the lady said no refills when sharing! I told her we are not sharing that I bought my plate and I'm the only one eating and she kept pointing to the sign that said \"no refills if sharing\" I told her again he did not drink any of it and he is just sitting with me. She still would not give me a refill then I asked for water and she just looked at me like I was stupid. I ate my meal without anything to drink and I told her their service was far from acceptable and I would never come back if that's how they treat their customers. Take your money elsewhere."}
{"text":"I just started teaching nearby and thought I'd try this place out. Yes, it is bare bones when you walk in, but you should know that by the \"Express\" in the restaurant's name. This is somewhere to get your eats and keep it moving. The portions are HUGE and at a fair price. Service is quick and food it hot. I ordered chicken and shrimp combo. Both were moist, and with broccoli, mushrooms, and carrots I didn't feel so bad about my Japanese craving. I'll definitely return!"}
{"text":"The outside of the building seems unassuming enough but when you step inside, the reality is a small restaurant with the bare essential.  The food is acceptable but definitely not my first choice of True Japanese cuisine. The portions are small but when the price is very low you can't expect much more. If you're in the area,  Niyoshi will do but if you're looking for more upscale and better quality then look elsewhere."}
{"text":"Good food for a great price. Just wish they had more than carrots and mushroom as vegetables"}
{"text":"This place is my favorite Japanese take-out. We visit the restaurant at least once or twice a week just depending on our schedule, the food is amazing and hearty portions. I would definitely recommend trying them out you won't be sorry!"}
{"text":"We eat here about once a week. Great food. Great service.  You can't make the food yourself for the amount of money they charge.  It's so cheap and the portions are big.  I always get the hibachi chicken with  a side salad and a side of stir fried cabbage. The cabbage is to die for! Don't pass up this place"}
{"text":"Great food! I have been going here for several years & they never disappoint. I love the sweet carrots."}
{"text":"The food is okay. I should have made this at home, I have before and it was a lot better.i have never in my life had bell peppers in fried rice . I ordered hibachi steak,  medium well. I received well done steak, extra chewy. Needless to say, I will not be eating here again."}
{"text":"I work in the same shopping complex, they are very kind enough to deliver my food most days. Sometimes the shrimp is a hit or miss based on size and taste, but the rice and vegetables are always wonderful. Definitely would go for a quick bite or for lunch."}
{"text":"Great specials averaging around $7.  The portions are extra large.  Large seating area.  This is your typical quick Japanese style stir fry.  Teriyaki and Hibachi stuff!   One thing that sucks - No egg rolls!  WTF?"}
{"text":"This place is good if you want a quickie! Good Japanese hibachi and an inexpensive place. It is a simple restaurant with no fancy decor. No private parking. Large dining room and has public restrooms! Would recommend!"}
{"text":"This is the place for great priced hibachi. The selections are the same as those restaurants who put on a show (but also charge double for the food). The food is always fresh and the service is always friendly. I moved back here from California recently and I can say that I've really missed these guys! Would recommend to friends & family."}
{"text":"The place a hole in the wall with handwritten signs all over the place. The food is decent at a fair price and the people are friendly. I most likely will return."}
{"text":"Holy cow... lived in the area for a few months now and never knew this place existed. It's 2 miles from my house and I'm in love. I will now be eating here at least once a week. I would even say this is the best Japanese hibachi I have ever eaten. I'm so excited I found this place!!!!"}
{"text":"I really like it here. When I'm in town visiting my parents, I always try to come back. Service is always friendly and prompt. Good hibachi style food at really good prices. It's a great stop for a quick bite. I highly recommend you give this place a try. I've never been disappointed."}
{"text":"I had the vegetable platter which comes with broccoli, onions, zucchini (which I didn't eat because they weren't cooked all the way), fresh mushrooms (which were delicious), sweet carrots (aka canned carrots) and rice. I wanted white rice, but they said they were only making fried rice which didn't make much sense. The rice was not very good. It came with 4 ounces of shrimp sauce. The platter was a little over $5 with tax included, which is a great prize for the portion. Food quality was alright, but I was really hungry and it was delicious as I was eating. My leftovers were so so.   Given the price and quality, I would give them another shot. Friendly cashier and food came out quickly.   https://youtu.be/z2_UYp5YvFY"}
{"text":"This place could certainly be 4 stars on a good day but the food is almost always over cooked. The taste is pleasant but no more exceptional than what you can make at home.   The reason why many of us in the community return time after time is the price. Their menu is shockingly cheap and the amount of food you get is beyond gracious.  Staff is always friendly and food is prepared quickly."}
{"text":"This place is pretty good, i come here once in a while, price is fair for what you get. My kids and i love their sweet carrots and the shrimp sauce is pretty good, i dont really care for it.   I have never had any problem with my food when i come here. And the wait is not usually long unless you have a big order. They do have signs on their wall telling you to check your order before you leave, and other stuff too. Service can be a little better and i think they should move some stuff to the back of the house. Maybe hire some more people, but i think its mostly a family run business."}
