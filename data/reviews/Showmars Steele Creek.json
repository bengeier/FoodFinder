{"text":"Far below East Blvd Showmars in Charlotte. We have not bothered going back. Fries pasty, fish fishy, gyro dry."}
{"text":"Having eaten a lot of gyros in Germany I did not have very high expectations. But I got the gyro pita as it comes (diced onions. Diced tomatoes. Zaziki sauce and of course lamb.) It was wonderful! Very flavorful. Hubby went for the gyro platter. It was a ton of food. Lol. We asked for extra sauce and they brought it right over. They come to your table and refill your drinks. Don't know if tipping is normal but the girls were all so sweet, so we did.  The staff were all very friendly and the place is super clean! Would I eat here again? Yes indeed and I'd bring my family!"}
{"text":"Had two meals here, the burger was sad and bland. The chicken was equally unappealing. Will not be visiting again."}
{"text":"We stopped in for a quick bite on a busy Sunday and knew Showmars wouldn't  be too busy and allow us to get to our next event on time. I have been to Showmars multiple times, but not recently and never to this location   I ordered the single patty mushroom and cheddar pita burger with onion rings and sweet tea. It was all okay, nothing exciting but not terrible either. The pita was actually really good, but the quality of the burger and toppings was just meh.   The hubby had the four chicken tender platter with fries, hushpuppies, slaw and a side of tzatziki sauce. It was normal fast foodish quality and aside from the tzatziki sauce was nothing special. The sauce was quite tasty, those it's possible it was bottled.  The table waitress who refills the tea and takes your plates was friendly enough and refilled our test before we departed with a smile. They have the \"good ice\" so I had to get a refill.   I might could stretch it to a 3.5, but it probably wasn't a solid 4 star meal, so we'll stay on 3. We'd go back but it won't be the top of our first choices list any time soon"}
{"text":"This is a brand new location open just a few days. I've eaten at other locations over the years. All good experiences. The staff is always very friendly and courteous. Very welcoming! I love the seafood platter, the flounder and shrimp are always cooked perfectly. This new location carry on the goodness. Tonight I got the pita burger. Sooo very delicious!! Puts regular burgers to absolute Shame I tell ya! Every time I crave a burger it will be Showmar's pita burger over all the rest. So glad to have this new location in my neighborhood!!"}
{"text":"I'm overall happy with this place. Customer service was on point. They get to you fast and neat. Came back and check on us a couple of times. I alway get the gyros when I go to Showmars.. And they never fails. So happy they now open one near my home!!!"}
{"text":"Always a good experience. Love the gyros, love the fried fish. Great value for the money. Prepared fresh. Attentive service considering how busy it can be. They come around to refresh your drink and so forth."}
{"text":"All I wanted was a fish sandwich..it was delicious..make sure you add cheese. Never again will I buy another processed fish patty from a fast food restaurant..also purchased the cactus chili which was yummy."}
{"text":"Great location, great food, great customer service. What more could ya want? Most of my friends want to hit up the showmars on fish sandwich special day (I forget if it's tuesday or wednesday). I like showmars in general - as a whole I give them a 4 star rating but, this location gets 5 - I feel like they go the extra mile. Go eat there and see what I mean."}
{"text":"We came in at 2pm. They were very friendly and fast. It took 10 min to get a fish dinner and gyro. Food was fresh and employees were going around the dinning room making sure the guests were okay."}
{"text":"My wife and I have eaten at this location a couple of times, with no problems. Tonight we were in a hurry and asked for a take out order. After arriving home we discovered both Gyro platters we ordered were not as expected. Eating in they provide onion, lettuce, tomato, tzatziki sauce, and a nice presentation. Instead of even close to the standard we see dinning in, we were greeted with a pile of meat covered with wax paper, and a single piece of pita bread. (plus our ordered sides)  I believe a consistent product between dinning in and take out would go a long way towards improving customer experience. Also note, we drove an additional 15 minutes to return to the store, in order to find our missing tzatziki sauce; which goes a long way in improving the flavor of the cold food we returned to. They did however offer 4 replacement sauces instead of the two that should have been provided."}
{"text":"I believe this is the best location in Charlotte.  The place is new, clean, courteous, efficient and well in a great location.  The other locations can take lessons.  Especially the one on E. 7th Street they need to tear it down and start over. ; in that order"}
{"text":"This place is relatively new in the Steele creek area. I've visited a few times, enough to form a good opinion on this fast casual Greek restaurant.  The staff is always friendly and the service has always been quick for me. I usually get orders to go.  When an employee locks eyes with you it's usually followed by a smile. Nice these days.  As far as the food is concerned, it's always good. I know what to expect when I come hear. I'm not looking to be transported to Greece while I'm eating  or Anthony like that. They don't pretend to be something they are not. Which I appreciate. I'd be happy to recommend this showmars to anyone asking my opinion.  My go to meal? Gyro platter and a hamburger."}
{"text":"Updated review . Ordered tonight at Showmars to go , A bowl of chili with a side of onion rings and a Gyro platter. Side salad had no dressing , and no feta cheese , platter had soggy fries and no Tzatziki sauce . My side pitas could've broken a window because they were hockey pucks . The onion rings were dried out with no taste . The only thing that was decent was the chili and definitely not a reason to return . Almost $30 bucks out the window and not worth driving 30 minutes in traffic each way."}
{"text":"I am just amazed at how fast it is here for takeout. I was ordering a pita platter and the souvlaki platter and it was barely three minutes from the time I paid until my number was called. Impressive!  The order was perfectly accurate and had all the appropriate fixings including tzatziki sauce, salad dressing, ketchup, cutlery and napkins. Well done.  The restaurant is clean, too. As is the parking lot."}
{"text":"I've been going to Showmars every once in a while for over ten years. I almost always get the Greek salad with gyro meat. I love the dressing, gyro meat, and the crunchy tortilla bowl.   Today I stopped by this location for the first time and ordered my usual for dine in. It comes to my table, but instead of the familiar warm crunchy bowl the whole thing is in a big white bowl with a few pieces of normal pita bread on the side. I was a little surprised and asked the guy what happened to the bowl and he proceeded to give me a lecture on how Showmars is trying to go healthier and they are doing away with the bread bowls. He went on and on about going healthier while I just stared at him. Then finally he asks me if I want a bread bowl \"because they have a few.\"  No thanks, I said after being shamed into needing to eat \"healthier.\"  Then he keeps asking me if I'm sure. Not twice or three times, but four times. By the last time I stopped being polite and just said, No, I am fine, I would like to eat now.   I get the menu change, but somebody could have told me while I was ordering and the guy should have just left with a smile after the first or second time I said no thanks."}
{"text":"Sicilia is very rude. I paid 10 dollar for a lunch platter to find out no drink included. After I paid for the order she handed my card and walked away. No thank you...No have a good day. You can get better service at eastway drive with better prices and cold beverages."}
{"text":"Showmars have always been a go to place for lunch or dinner, but I was disappointed in the Somora as it was not good as it has been in the past. The manager informed me that there was a change in food vendors where the pre-packaged souvlaki was not the same. This was always my favorite dish. However, the salmon greek salad that I replaced it with was very good."}
{"text":"food is good, but check your order. I ordered cactus chilli and broccoli cheese soup, and I got 2 broccoli cheese soups.  also ordered a salad and only got spoons in my bag and no pita...  :/ I rated it so low because when I pay 20 something bucks for take out I expect it to be right. to late to drive back up."}
{"text":"Stopped by for a gyro the other day. Very friendly staff, food tasted slightly better than cafeteria food. Overall not likely to go back for round two, but again super friendly environment."}
{"text":"I am not a big fan of their \"Greek food\" and I love Greek food. But the burgers are OK. The fish is not to my tastes either as I prefer thick pieces of fish rather than long pieces. And for my tastes they put too much breading on the fish. all that said, they couldn't be friendly here at this location. They always stop by your table more than once to check if you need anything."}
{"text":"Great fries and the burgs are a great combo to get. I love the Gyros are always great too, I am so glad Steele Creek has a Showmars. They are very friendly and polite too. I would recommend this place without a doubt."}
{"text":"We ate there today for lunch. It was quick not crowded. Service was good and fast. Restroom was clean and so was dinning area. Food tasted good but not anything to brag about.  Would eat there again but would not go out of my way."}
{"text":"Good food, service and environment. One waitress walked away with my drink and never returned. Had to ask for another drink from another waitress"}
{"text":"Our \"go to\" place for lunch. Fast, fresh, and affordable. The employees are all friendly and super helpful. They check in to make sure you have everything you need and run for refills as needed. It can get busy/crowded, burnt service and turnaround is quick and efficient. Menu favorites: Greek salad with gyro meat, fish pita (get extra tartar sauce), pita burger, gyro.   During our last visit, the food arrived at our table as we were sitting down...can't get much faster than that!  Oh, and if you are lucky enough to work where I do (nearby), you get a free drink! VIP status! :)"}
{"text":"Show are is excellent for families. My daughter & I share the the platter every time."}
{"text":"Showmars is my favorite Greek restaurant in town,  love the Super C and fish platters.  Gyros are awesome too.  One of my favorite stops on the way home from a long day at work."}
{"text":"We really liked this restaurant. Everything was really fresh and the service was outstanding. I couldn't believe how quickly we were served."}
