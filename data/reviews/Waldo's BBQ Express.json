{"text":"If the app would let me I'd give this little hidden gem a 4.5. For the price, it's some of the best BBQ in Phoenix. Nothing at Waldo's is over 4 bucks! Large drinks are $1.00. It's perfect for the Moon Valley residents. Fast drive through and tremendous sauce. I got the Brisket Sandwich. Warning...portions aren't huge. I also got the \"pig\" burrito. Moist pulled pork. So for $7.00, I got an awesome meal and diet coke. Oh yeah, the menu price is the actual price. They pay the sales tax! Im going back tomorrow! (No I'm not a friend of theirs. Driving by and saw it around 7th St and Hatcher. Little place... From Waldo's bbq in Mesa.)"}
{"text":"Very pleasant surprise.  I had to meet someone nearby, and while I was waiting, decided to grab some lunch - saw Waldo's and thought I would give it a try.  Food was great, service was surprising good - a couple of young men behind counter and in the back who where very well mannered and attentive.  The food is served promptly, the restaurant is very clean, the service is great, the food is great, and the prices very competitive."}
{"text":"New owners who eliminated the $5 deal and there wait time is extremely long.  Left afterbeing in drive throughfor over 30 minutes.  Time to find a new place."}
{"text":"I love this place! The food is delicious! The portions in the sampler platter will feed two easy! The sandwich sizes are a bit smaller but if you order a double meat with fries it should cost around 6$. This should satisfy most appitietes. The young woman who usually serves me is very pretty and dispite her beauty she is very polite which is rare these days. Im used to an additude from women who know they are attractive. Tho the food isnt prepared at this location it is slow smoked in mesa. Also the prices reflect the fact that it was cooked off site, and costs slightly less than mesa. I would highly recommend the sampler platter."}
{"text":"Ordered via Grubhub after a coworker was so thrilled with her food. The food is equivalent to the price. No seasoning; definitely would consider it Tex mex and not 'bbq.' I ordered the beef brisket (mush, no texture or flavor), beans (they're not bbq or baked beans...more like refried), and the mac n cheese (it had cabbage and bacon in it ). Probably won't waste my money or calories again here lol"}
{"text":"My family of 6 came in for dinner and we only spent $34!! We were completely satisfied with our food and for the price you can't beat it. I like that the sides are individually portioned and only $1!!! We will definitely be back!!! Very reasonable BBQ, quick, and satisfying!"}
{"text":"Short and sweet...Awesome BBQ,  clean place, fast and friendly  and damn reasonable.  Spicy fries are amazing.  Try this place.  I regret I only just found this great place last week .  Returned twice since.  Yum!"}
{"text":"I absolutely love Waldo's food. The meat is so tender and delicious. The spicy fries are also really good. I recommend Waldo's to everyone I know."}
{"text":"Awesome brisket sandwich yummy!! Sweet potato fries Olord to die for.  Great food cheap prices very smart!!!! We will be back and as for customer service excellent thank u!!!"}
{"text":"This bbq is just okay. I had the brisket today around 1pm and I found it to be flavorless and dry. It felt like I had bought brisket from the frozen food section at the grocery store. I had the side of mac n cheese which was good, no complaints there. If you know bbq like I do, then you know that this doesn't even fall in a top 10 for best bbq in phoenix. I will not be returning. Do yourself a favor and drive up the street to Naked BBQ it's 10x better."}
{"text":"Love this spot and I'm picky about bbq. Drive thru is quick. You can buy ribs by the bone. Cooked to perfection, fall off the bone. Don't even need the sauce. Do yourself a favor and go there."}
{"text":"Cute, little restaurant!  The food is good for the price.  I love the BBQ sauce,  just wished they gave more of it.  The young lady at the window was very friendly and helpful. I will definitely come back for more!"}
{"text":"For real deal smoky BBQ, you've must eat at WALDO'S.  Exceptional service.  Bought some sauce to bring home."}
{"text":"Great food great price.  Not great food at a great price or for a great price.  Just cheap ass great food! I suggest a two sandwiches not a double and two sides.  Try the slaw on the wich........."}
{"text":"This place is always busy so expect a long line however people are friendly so it makes the time go by fast. You can bring your dogs to the patio. Breakfast is yummy. Not your conventional way of ordering.  You order and pay first at register then your given a number for your table. Get your beverage they have a huge selection of milks!"}
{"text":"Just say no!! BBQ fast = no bueno!! Save your money, go to a really bbq place , horrible service, crappie food, definitely not worth the money"}
{"text":"Lets see, you live in north central Phoenix, you love good BBQ and you haven't stopped at Waldo's on 7th St. yet. What the hells the matter with you? It's right there across the street from the post office on Mountain View. Go in there, and for six stinking dollars, you can get a pig sandwich, a side of beans and a drink. For a couple of bucks more try one of the ribs on a bone. You can thank me later."}
{"text":"The bbq is really good & service was quick, unfortunately the spot has homeless people that keep asking me for money at the drive thru both times I have gone.  Also the staff charge me twice by mistake and didn't refund.  They had me called the manager the next day,  he promised to refund the money to my card but never did.  I keep on calling he keep saying two more days.  After three weeks I got tired and had my bank deal with it.  After my bank called I got the refund."}
{"text":"Counter girl peppy and nice. The building is an old Taco Bell building with a drive through and a front ramada with three picnic tables. The eating environment is between rustic and beat up, which is the only reason it is receiving 4 stars instead of 5 stars. The building and kitchen are clean. I looked for dirt and was unsuccessful. They obviously work hard on cleaning. Again the restaurant is somewhere between rustic and beat up,  but it is clean.  The barbecue is 5 star all the way. It is flawless in texture and taste. I had the 'Pig' Sandwich and potato salad. The Sinaloence (wife) had the same sandwich and an order of Pork Ribs,  with Sweet Potato Fries. .  Excellent, excellent, excellent. . This was our second time here and both visits were the same high quality. I fully recommend this restaurant to any barbecue lover."}
{"text":"Pretty good, priced fair. They didn't have a full pound of brisket by time we showed up so they didn't charge us full price. The sauce was on the side, it was pretty spicy in a good way. You should try it."}
{"text":"Great experience here,  at first glance I was a but skeptical,  but oh my gosh the food is good. I shall return.  Yum!"}
{"text":"This place is literally a lil gem. The menu is simple n the prices are more than fair for the quality of bbq they serve. Pig sandwich is awesome."}
{"text":"This place is a joke. When you come for lunch, they will tell you the brisket, mac n cheese, and fries are \"not ready\". Try coming for dinner, and they will tell you they are out of those same items. This has happened to me four times now, no joke. This place has good food, but only for an incredibly small window of time every day. Do yourself a favor and go to the 7th street location. Its is a much further drive for me, but they appear to be better managed and stocked because I have never had them tell me the menu items were not available."}
{"text":"Amazing BBQ.  I've been to several places around the valley.  Dickys bobby q, bootleggers etc.  and this one seriously has the best food.  It's a little intimidating since it's kinda a weird drive thru situation in the hood but every time I go there I'm one happy girl.  The brisket is delicious.  The pulled chicken-- heaven.  I'm serious ladies and gentlemen do not let the exterior fool u this is seriously a hidden gem.  Their BBQ sauce is perfect tangy/sweet and doesn't seem fake or filled with preservatives or fillers or sweeteners.  Just go and try it.  Place is clean- well lit and staff is pleasant.  U may have to avoid a bum coming out of the nearby circle k as u drive up- but do it.  I never spend a lot- have a good sized portion and tasty food."}
{"text":"Good bbq - the meat, sauce, and bread work well together. I like the brisket sandwich (the cow).  For a  great bbq value, get the sampler (choose 2 meats & get 2 meaty ribs for $10 including tax).  I would drive here for the cheesecake jars alone, but combined with the bbq makes this a favorite place to eat."}
{"text":"This location has been closed for a week. No idea if they are still in business as of 4/29/2016. I like the 7th Street location better anyway.  Good bbq - the meat, sauce, and bread work well together. I like the brisket sandwich (the cow)."}
{"text":"When I heard there was an \"express\" BBQ place not too far from my home my first thought was; how good can it be?  When I showed up, I noticed  the restaurant itself is \"divey\" which I don't mind. I was really impressed with how good the food was. I had the sampler platter with pork ribs, brisket and the sausage link. The brisket is super tender and tasty and the ribs were falling off the bone. It was more food than I should have eaten but I powered through like a champ. Best of all, the sampler was only $10! My son had the BBQ chicken sandwich and fries for only $5. While I'm no BBQ expert, I thought it was very good , especially for the price & the young lady at the front was very nice.  I'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"Contrary to the big red banner at the top of the page, Waldo's Pig N Out is very much open.  The meat is good. The sauce is good. The bread - a small piece of a baguette - is the weak link to this place. Baguettes don't have the proper structure for a BBQ sandwich, and you end up with more meat and sauce on the table than in the bread. Hold off on the sandwiches and buy the meat by weight, and get some buns at the convenience store on the way home."}
{"text":"Small place with great BBQ that's served quick.  Folks working there are helpful and friendly. Very basic small dining area inside and out.  Had the ribs and the brisket which are served no-frills and were great. Very inexpensive and with sides and drinks for $1, you get a lot for your money."}
{"text":"Waldos by far is one of the best bbq spots in Arizona for sure. Not only is the food great but the service is always exceptional as well. I would recomend this anyone passing by the area!!! It is amazing all the way from its ownership to its food!"}
{"text":"Tried Waldo's today for lunch, as we were actually in the area grabbing tacos at Most Wanted.  Since we were already having a \"first\" lunch down the street, we only ordered the pork ribs... and they were delicious!  Super tender, smoky pink, truly fall off the bone and juicy.  Great prices and love the round pricing.  Can't wait to try the other menu items another day!"}
{"text":"Great food but small sandwich. No salad option available for sides. Brisket is done right. :-)"}
{"text":"WARNING! Waldo's prices are $2 higher in-store than currently shown on their site  for the meat by the pound. Chicken and pork are now $12/lb.(up 20%) and beef is $14.. That said, the take-home bulk meats are the still the  best value per portion IMO.  My $5 brisket sandwich was moist and tender, with a hearty beef blast and sauce on the side. However, I'd say that the sandwich was tiny, rather than small, and not a good deal, in my mind. I read that brisket  is in short supply nationwide, so I guess I should be happy, just to have it at all. Yet, if you add a $2 'side' and a $2 drink, you're now at $9, for which you can get a more generous lunch special almost anywhere. But dang, the food is so good.  Individual ribs are also up 50 cents, which equates to a 25% increase in the past three months. I didn't get a 25% raise on my paycheck this quarter, did you?  I believe Waldo has confused the terms 'gradual', and 'drastic' in regard to price hikes.  To offset my minor pains, the spicy fries remain $1. Maybe the very best buy on the planet; and what you get is as many fries as I'd care to eat in any one sitting. Have a drink at hand for these.  Service was, once again, friendly."}
{"text":"Pig sandwich, spicy fires, coleslaw. DELICIOUS. Simple, affordable goodness. The service is friendly!"}
{"text":"I drove by this place last week, and it looked inviting, so I swung by today. Overall it was delicious. You know when people say meat \"falls off the bone\"? The meat on the ribs here literally fell off the bone; I had do ask for a fork as a result. The sauce was very tasty; its in a squeeze bottle and I wanted it to have been warm, rather than room temperature, but my tastebuds didn't seem to care. It was very clean, reasonably priced, and the service was friendly. I'd return by myself, and with others."}
{"text":"drive thru BBQ what I else do you need brisket sandwich in like two min for 5$ no tax man what a deal it the the best BBQ but it's still good if your lazy like me don't want to vet out if the car try these guys"}
{"text":"Place was clean, but the BBQ didn't stack up to several others in the area. It was worth the try, but wasn't quite there."}
{"text":"Wow! We were looking for a fast place north of the airport that wasn't a fast food chain, and we're so glad we found this place on Yelp! We tried the meat combo with ribs, brisket, and pulled pork, and it was heaven! The kids had the chicken strips and they devoured them, saying they were some of the best ever.  For sides, we tried the Mac & cheese and sweet potato fries - both divine.   Not a fancy place at all, and quite small, but it was perfect for our needs. And the prices were unbelievably low! Two thumbs way up."}
{"text":"I went to this place a few weeks ago and all I can say is wow...Best bbq i have ever had and price was super cheap...If your in the area you have to try this if you love ribs.."}
{"text":"Why even have a restaurant that serves such garbage? My first and last meal from here was meat that was almost spoiiled...turning and mushy. Never going back!"}
{"text":"The two stars are for the nice person who took my order.  I'm sorry but this is not a good barbecue place.   The food wasn't bad I've had worse but I don't know the barbecue sauce was just horrible.  The macaroni and cheese was super watery. Potato salad wasnt bad and the pork was tender but Didnt have a good flavor.  I went the first time because it was convenient but I don't believe I'll be back I tried the one on Thunderbird and 19th also and that's just as bad  The employees were nice though"}
{"text":"Tiny place. Service was great. Had a liittle bit of everything. Brisket, chicken, pork BBQ Mac and cheese, cole slaw, Cajun fries. Meat was tender and sauce was flavorful. The sides were ok but who can beat the $1 price for them. Will be back again."}
{"text":"Do you know what I hate? When people write a review but don't take any pictures of what they're actually reviewing. Don't worry I took pictures of everything I ate :)  Don't let the exterior fool you this place is home to some yummy BBQ and friendly service. I knew from previous reviews that the sandwiches were on the small side so I ordered 2 (one pig and one chicken) plus a mac and cheese and fries...I skipped lunch and everything sounded amazing and had a fat kid moment leave me alone ;) Sandwiches were $3 a piece and sides/drinks were $1 a piece as previously mentioned by other Yelpers.   Food came out promptly and I started on the chicken sandwich first which was flavorable then came the pork which tasted yummy as well. I put their BBQ sauce on both just because, it tasted nice and sweet but not too sweet. The roll was nice and soft too not like the hard ones that hurt your teeth biting into them. Mac and cheese tasted homemade not the boxed version that these other reviewers must be used to and the fries were almost shoestring style and crispy. After eating all that I can definitely tell you that 1 sandwich will do the trick of filling you up, don't overdo it!  They have a sign posted that you find another BBQ place that is better to please still visit them. I think that says something along the lines that they aren't claiming to be the best there is cause there is definitely better out there but if you're in the neighborhood do check them out!"}
{"text":"This place is a real diamond in the rough! Amazing food, even without sauce...but try the sauce, it's really really good. The \"spicy fries\" are great, the mac n cheese is traditional southern style (milk n flour base), the potato salad was decent.  We had the 5.00 combo that came with choice sandwich, side and a drink. Great value, and the roll is fresh. Worth a visit!"}
{"text":"I heard about this place from a friend and so glad I tried it out. I tried the ribs, brisket and pulled pork. The ribs were amazing!  Fall off the bone delicious. Side items are only $1 each. The sweet potato fries were yum, the Mac and cheese I didn't care for but other people did so it's a personal preference. We got a root beer float to go for $2. Wish I lived closer. Check it out. Delicious + low prices = score!"}
{"text":"Hidden little gem in the Sunnyslope neighborhood that serves great barbeque. Offers your standard fare of BBQ chicken, pork, or beef or a combo platter of all three. The meat is so tender its falling apart and it comes with an excellent sauce that is tasty and not too sweet. Prices are very reasonable and service was friendly. It's a tiny place so you'll likely want to get your food to go and you need to be careful where you park or you might get blocked in, but if you're craving some good BBQ this is a great place to go.  They also have locations in Mesa and a new one at 19th Avenue and Thunderbird if you're in those areas."}
{"text":"First time I tried Waldos Express. The staff is friendly. The food was ready fast. And most important the food was awesome ! The home fries are delicious . The bbq brisket was yummy . You get a lot of food for the price. I would  go back again"}
{"text":"This place has been on my bookmark list for a really long time now and I got to try it last week with some work buddies..  Wow, was it delicious!  Barbecue is a very personal subject and virtually everyone likes it  in one form or another.  I was raised on the Texas version---smoked meats with sauce on the side, if needed.    On the staff's recommendation, I ordered the pig sandwich.  My side was classic mac and cheese.  Others in my party ordered the brisket with coleslaw.  The food is fantastic!  many places make the mistake of overlooking the sides in favor of the meat (or vice versa) but this joint was on point all the way around.  We all had the lunch special which ended up costing us $5. each.  We ate inside but the drive-thru was also jumpin' the entire time we were there.  The staff was really nice and the service was really efficient.  I was so impressed by this place that I recommended them as a lunch option for our quarterly mailing season--we are usually slammed and end up having food catered in.  This will be a great change from pizza and sandwiches!!  I also intend to take advantage of their very reasonable by-the pound price...beats the heck out of cooking !!"}
{"text":"I really struggled between 2 stars and 3 stars but ultimately decieded on three because of the quality of the food, however, I have a huge disclaimer when it comes to portion size.    My dad and I noticed this place about a week or so ago and I've been dying to try it so we did.  I had read the reviews about the portion size but it was a huge let down.  I will start this by saying I know that most BBQ is on the rather pricey side given the time that goes into making it.  So when we came across what seemed to be a reasonably priced BBQ joint, I was excited.  I orderd a pulled chicken sandwich ($3), a brisket burrito ($3), and a side of cowboy beans ($1).  I believe the total for that was $7.  My first issue was when I asked what exactly made up the \"cowboy beans\" as im not a huge fan of heat when it comes to sides and the guy at the counter replied \"It's just baked beans\" which to me meant sweet, soft beans.  Opened up the container and first thing I see is green chili chunks.  Now, the beans were fine and not too spicy but when I customer asks what all is in a dish/side dish/menu item, its probably best to make sure you name the ingredients.   Second issue was that calling the Brisket Burrito a burrito is a huge over statement.  Mini burrito is much more accurate.  I got three, maybe four bites and thats all she wrote. At $0.75 to $1.00 a bite, itd be nice to get a little more than something smaller than most granola bars.  Parking was also a huge pain with three spots jammed in front but they do have more parking on the sides and a drive thru as well.  The Pulled chicken sandwich was good but again small, little better value than the burrito. Good in taste and BBQ sauce was on the side.  The good points of this trip were the size of the Pork ribs (giant really, after seeing the \"burrito\" I couldn't believe how big the ribs were), the brisket (which hands down was the best I've ever had) and the BBQ sauce (which they gave us about 8 mini containers of.  It was sweet but still had a bit of a kick to it and I will likely go back just because I want to get some of that sauce to try on my own grilling.  Overall, they need some work on the descriptions of their food, portion sizes, and better sides (mac and cheese should be a must for any BBQ joint).    Gave it one \"$\" because you can (and we did, much to our shegrin) get out of there for under $10 per person, but do yourself a favor and order more than you think you might eat, then it might be about right.  I'll probably give these guys at least one more chance when I go to get some of their BBQ sauce but I may give them a month or two to try and get things worked out."}
{"text":"Can't go wrong with their BBQ ribs and their mac and cheese! Great food for the price!"}
{"text":"This is a good bbq place for Phoenix. After being disappointed from trying other 4+ star Yelp BBQ places in town, I decided to try Waldo's. The brisket is good, moist and lean with a good smoky flavor. The pork ribs were tender and moist but lacked smoke flavor and almost seemed boiled. The sauce was pretty good and complimented the meats pretty well. Will come back to try other items in my quest for some good 'cue in the valley."}
{"text":"I'm writing this right after having lunch here and now debating if I want to eat here again for dinner.  Everything we had was wonderful and the meat had a touch of smoke!  The sampler plate I got was packed with fall-off-the-bone ribs (2), pulled pork and brisket for $10.  Their BBQ sauce is unbelievably tasty.  I also ordered mac n cheese and cowboy beans (each were $1).  If that wasn't enough food, I had to complete my meal with a mason jar of strawberry cheesecake for $4.  Ok, I've decided to come back tomorrow."}
{"text":"I personally like this place. Cheep and tasty, the ribs are a little unusually prepared, but the pulled pork is excellent."}
{"text":"I've been curious about Waldo's for a while, and then discovered that they'd moved in to the old Dairy Queen at T-Bird and 19th Avenue. It's an \"Express\" location, which means they receive food cooked at their main location-when it's gone, it's gone. But that's the way BBQ works anyway, with cook times from 5-15 hours... Pulled Pork and Chicken sandwiches are $3. They're on the small side, but...they're $3! Pork was fair--no bark, smoke flavor was, uh, delicate at best, but serviceable. The chicken was impressive--moist, better flavor than the pork. I had a small taste of the brisket, which is sliced very thin. It displayed a smoke ring, and tasted pretty good. The meat was a bit dry, but there was plenty of pan sauce with it. The french fries were incredible, I must say. And they're a buck. The last little tid bit of info is that all the prices are tax inclusive. Couple sandwiches, fries, drinks, ten spot flat. Give 'em a try. It may not be luscious like the higher price q joints, but it's priced accordingly!"}
{"text":"Very good BBQ, the sauce was incredible and the BBQ-Baked-Beans are the best I've ever had. They had that slight spicy kick to them but weren't too overbearing. The Mac and Cheese was also phenomenal. The only reason this place doesn't get 5/5 stars is because their portions leave something to be desired, literally! The sides come in perfectly fine portions but the sandwiches are on the small side. Now, if you're a smaller person with a smaller appetite OR you don't mind buying two sandwiches then go ahead and pretend my review is 5/5 stars.   What's the worst that could happen from you visiting this establishment...? You might end up buying several delicious BBQ sandwiches! LOL"}
{"text":"Well, I use to go all the way downtown Phoenix, to get great Bar-B-Q, but now it's 3 minutes from my house.  Great food, very friendly service and the Manager, Laura Davison, has one of the sweetest dispositions, I've ever seen, from anyone in the restaurant business.  I'll definitely be passing this info. along to my Facebook page.  It's nice to be able to recommend a business, that goes out of their way, to do it right.  Also, this place is squeaky clean and well lit.  Small dining area inside, but plenty of room on the patio.  Very reasonable prices."}
{"text":"Great BBQ without a ridiculous price gets an A+ in my book.  Good BBQ is not brain surgery and the price should not make it seem like it is in my opinion. Waldo's has it down on how to make a good meal.  The meat is very tender and the portions are perfect.  They do have an amazing special for $5 that includes your sandwich, fries and a drink.  They offer sides for $1-$2 and they portions are such that you can even share a side.  The whole family (4) can eat for $22 and still manage a movie out.  :)  The inside is no frills but I don't want to pay more just because there is a fancy table or picture on the wall.   We not only eat here as a family but I bring the food in for the men at work (15+) and there is not a peep among them while they are eating.  A new addition to the menu is a spicy bbq sauce that is good for those who like some spice in life, otherwise their regular sauce is quite flavorful too.  Enjoy!"}
{"text":"I had this bbq for the first time and I can say I was impressed.  For $5 I got a bbq pork sandwich, cole slaw, and an order of spicy french fries.  The sandwich was pretty small but it actually filled me up quite well, especially for only $3 for the sandwich, it is a steal.  I really liked the spicy fries as well.  I will definitely go back here again.  You get a homemade bbq sandwich with two sides for $5!  They even gave me extra bbq sauce and ketchup without having to ask for it."}
{"text":"I have driven by this place more than a few times. To be honest we were really skeptical. At night the lighting looks straight up suicidal like in a scary movie.   I forgot my most favorite place to eat tacos, is closed on Monday. We were just driving and in a split second we decided to go through the drive thru.  Upon glancing at the prices on the drive thru menu we decided that for something this cheap if it turned out to be bad, no big deal!  We both had the bird, or BBQ chicken sandwich. Also ordered: chicken burrito, side of Mac n cheese and cole slaw and a large soda. Literally It was $12- $13 for everything. And then when it actually didn't taste like garbage as we so wrongingly assumed we were pleasantly surprised!   The place looks old as shit and I too remember when this was a Taco Bell long ago as one other reviewer mentioned.   The woman working was very nice. Cold BBQ or cold Mac n cheese are unforgivable sins. Our food was piping hot when we got it. The sauce was a classic sauce just enough smoke, little vinegar bite, tangy and sweet.   It wasn't the best I've ever had but it's ridiculously affordable and above average in taste. I put the cole slaw, and Mac n cheese on top of my chicken and covered it with BBQ sauce accordingly. Would recommend you do the same.   The burrito was simple. Not huge. But it gave me a good excuse to eat two or three to go ramekins worth of BBQ sauce a condiment I don't get to enjoy as much as I should."}
{"text":"The food was amazing!  Authentic Bbq and very very good I recommend this to anyone on the area.  Pulled pork is stellar. Thank you guys!"}
{"text":"Nice down-home place.  I got the sampler and chose the sausage link, brisket, and ribs.  I'm a big brisket fan but the sausage stole the show here.  It had a softer, more uniform texture inside and it falls apart in your mouth.  Juicy without being greasy.  Really well done.    The brisket was good and the ribs were really, really tender.  When I left I didn't have the usual \"heavy\" feeling that you get from BBQ.    One thing I didn't try (but wanted to) was the cheesecake jar.  I included a picture of it.  Very friendly staff, clean, easy to order, fast, and the tax is included.  They also have drive-thru."}
{"text":"Gotta love this place. It's small, unpretentious, has an abbreviated - hence, express - menu, the food is really inexpensive, and fun signs decorate the walls (my fave: \"If you can find a better barbecue, please eat here anyway\"). The guys working there are really friendly and even accommodated my request to use the gluten-free bread slices that I brought with me to use for making the pig (pulled pork) sandwich that I ordered. The sandwich was really good; the meat was moist and tender, with a pleasant smoky flavor. The creamy slaw I ordered as a side was the perfect complement, and I enjoyed the cheesecake dessert which came in a cool little mason jar. I hike the nearby North Mountain Preserve often and this will be a cool place for me to drop in after hiking to grab a quick tasty meal."}
{"text":"Gooooood BBQ & GREAT prices....! $4 pig Sand $2.50 for big ass BBQ RIB $1 buck for Cowboy beans & they're freakin Bomb! All prices incl. tax... Easy to know your bill...."}
{"text":"Only good things to say about this place. Let's start with something honest, though: it's a little, one room barbecue hut, so I'm gonna go straight to the food. I'll have to skip the friendly cashier, clean atmosphere, and quick service. Now onto the food. First course: a sweet potato fry on the way home with takeout. AKA the freshest food I have had all week. Imagine a crispy coat over a soft, fresh potato, still with the texture of sweet potato flesh. I felt loved even as it burned my mouth a bit. Then the MEAT. Authentic cuts of tender goodness (I had the sampler platter with two servings of chicken). A great little thing- no salt on the fries, no sauce on the meat because they know you're an adult. It's all there on the table for you to apply at your own discression. Only warning- sandwiches and sides are smaller than you may expect, so get enough if it's your dinner."}
{"text":"Honestly I'm ticked. I waited for about 10 minutes to get to the window. Got sandwich and fries. Simple right? I get home which is literally one minute away, and the bread is soggy. The fries are limp and soggy. I've been here before and it's nothing to write home about. But geez.... Is it too much to ask for some decent quick food?"}
{"text":"Excellent food, clean atmospere, great service.  Reasonable prices.  Love this place!"}
{"text":"Excellent, Excellent, Ecellent! You have to try it! Great price and awesome staff. We have been several times and just love it."}
{"text":"Good BBQ at a great price. Fast service thru Drive Thru.We had the Brisket, Pulled Pork, and Ribs......all were great. Spicy fries and coke slaw were excellent as well. Will go here again."}
{"text":"Just ok. The mac & cheese was great but the ribs where  not cooked all that well. Would not recommend unless you really want BBQ fast. It truly is express!"}
{"text":"Stopped in the other day for the first time. Was shocked at how reasonable the prices were AND they pay the sales tax. The food was good not great BBQ but good. I tried the sampler plate with brisket and pork. The pork had a real good taste to it and the brisket was tasty and tender (which is always a good thing). The ribs were still fatty though, the bone pulled out which for most of us is a good thing (unless you're an official KC BBQ Judge, they don't like that) but I think the heat could have been set a little higher to melt the fat more. The ribs were on the fatty side. The disappointing thing though was no rub or bark on any of the meat, the pulled pork obviously would have had the bark mixed in but should have been present on the brisket slices and ribs the bark also adds a bit of seasoning ad flavoring to the meat. So it tasted like smoke but not much else flavoring wise.   Overall it was an enjoyable experience. I would go back this is not really a good destination BBQ that I would go out of my way for place but good for a quick sandwich or in and out stop if in the area. Trust me I have had much worse then this. I really want to try their hot link sandwich"}
{"text":"We initially tried Waldo's on a whim, but have returned a couple of times because the food is really tasty.  The place is a bit of a dive and the door is really hard to open, but they have a handy drive-thru if you want to by-pass the inside.  I have tried all of the meats and the pork is my favorite.  Both of their mild and spicy BBQ sauces are great.  They also sell delicious cheesecake in little mason jars.  The service has been efficient and friendly during all of our visits.  Just writing this review gave me a craving for it..."}
{"text":"I live in the neighborhood and had noticed Waldo's while driving by, made a mental note to try it one day. Finally, on a night when I just didn't want to cook and pizza, Chinese or burgers weren't sounding good, I looked the menu up online and took a shot.  My husband and I tried the sampler plate, two good sized ribs with choice of 2 meats, as well as some extra ribs to share. Our meat choices were the brisket and the pulled pork.  I particularly loved the ribs, fall off the bone tasty and a great bargain at $1 each ala carte. The pulled pork was mighty fine as well.  We weren't crazy about the brisket. It was tasty but a little tough, but then again the price was terrific. The sides were good, nothing to rave about but a good accompaniment to the flavorful meats. I went through the drive through so I can't speak to the store itself, but the drive through experience was quick and accurate. This will now be a go to place for picking up dinner after work."}
{"text":"Nom Nom Nom. I decided to try it after driving past it a few times. It's delicious. I had the pig sandwich and Mac and cheese. The pulled pork is tender and stuffed in a tasty hoagie roll. I wish there was more cause I wooded it down. Lol Mac and cheese tasted homemade and was hot and fresh. Idk if they make their own BBQ sauce but it's seriously mouth watering. Loved it! Great food and great price. Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"If you're almost broke, meaning you can't afford to get BBQ from a real restaurant and you crave BBQ then I guess Waldo's is the place for you to go. Don't even look on the website because apparently they don't have the items on the website. I wanted the super sampler for $19.99. They said they didn't have it so I got a sampler with three choices of meat. I asked for chicken, pulled pork and brisket and they said 'no substitutions' so I had to get ribs instead of chicken. Service with an attitude here. I was happy that they didn't have the super sampler as I would have been even more upset spending 20 bucks on below average BBQ. Also please use the drive thru as you might have people in the parking lot pull a kitchen knife on you and ask for your wallet. Yes, it happened."}
{"text":"I go out if my way to stop by this place from time to time. I have always had a perfect service experience, and the food is consistently tasty and piping hot! These guys definitely under charge for the quality of their product."}
{"text":"Amazing food! Good prices. Definitely will return. Pulled chicken sandwich is incredible. Can't wait to try everything! Yum! Great customer service too!"}
{"text":"Very small portions at the 19th Ave. location. Food was average at best. I wont bother to go back. For what I got the brisket sandwich  was overpriced.   Small portions and just so so BBQ. I have had a lot better."}
{"text":"This is like my 3rd time going here. Good Mac n cheese and brisket sandwiches. They even give you barbecue sauce to put on it. Very yummy! :)"}
{"text":"Yummy!!! I got the sampler platter with pig and brisket, it was delicious! Well priced and the portions are huge!"}
{"text":"First time here & wow! Portions are huge and super reasonably priced! Sweet potato fries were delicious! I recommend the pork & brisket!"}
{"text":"I am a big fan of BBQ and this place was great. I was able to get 2 meals worth of food for under 15 bucks. The spicy fries are really good, and definitely spicy. I had the brisket and hot links as well as 2 ribs and it was all really tender and really tasty."}
{"text":"Pretty good for the price. Even though I knew I wouldn't be able to finish everything, I ordered a small variety of menu items for the sake of being able to try more things at once. The French fries were my favorite. Sounds strange but I'm a big fan of thin cut, limp, darkly browned fries. I can see how that might be a turn off for some people, but I thought they were great, especially with the course sea salt they were seasoned with. They reminded me of the fries at Outback Steakhouse. The Mac and cheese was really basic and simple. It was really bland at first but all it needed was a little salt and it was decent. The hot link sandwich and brisket sandwich were about as simple as it gets. A hot link sliced in half on a piece of baguette and a helping of brisket on a piece of baguette. Both with BBQ sauce on the side. The hot link was very good. The brisket, on the other hand was really disappointing. I love brisket, but the brisket here had ZERO flavor. It tasted like boiled meat. There was no tenderness, no juiciness, and worst of all no smokiness. At least the BBQ sauce was good. Lots of sweetness and not too vinegary. I will definitely be back to get another hot link and try a few more of the menu items. Oh and the prices are great - which earned them 4 stars instead of 3 from me."}
{"text":"This was one of my favorite places to get cheap bbq. Last time I went their it was no longer cheap. The sandwiches are small like 3 inches and for 5 bucks they're not worth it. If you do go try the spicy fries with the barbecue sauce they are awesome."}
{"text":"Really really good BBQ. Drive thru primarily, although they have a tiny area inside to eat. Small restaurant that's been in Phx for a long time. Check it out. It's worth it!"}
{"text":"Great prices for great food! It's the best BBQ I've had since moving to Arizona from Missouri. $9 for the sampler plate that filled me up and then some! The two of us ate for $20 plus tip and were thoroughly impressed with the taste and quality of the meats. Sauce was excellent as well. The sides were good too - the spicy fries are addictive."}
{"text":"Waldo's has great BBQ. Very tasty and tender. The sandwiches are a little small, but very good."}
{"text":"Better then I expected. The place was clean and there was a group of 4 ahead of me. The service was a tad slow considering they call themselves express. (I do not mind slow over rushed poor food) I had a pork sand and mac. The mac was forgettable but the pork was on a hoagie roll with a decent amount of meat. Sauce was on the side and was a decent flavor.  Please flavor the mac better and offer a spicy sauce as well.   I would be back for the $5 deal."}
{"text":"We walked in on Saturday night, they were out of Brisket and we wanted to try the meat combo because we have never eaten here before. The guy at the counter says we are are out for 30 minutes. I told my wife want to order sandwiches and split them and order different sides? She agrees and we tell them we want cowboy beans and mac and cheese, to which the guy replies \"no substitutions\" I nicely say \" but you do not have what we want to order.\" It is not as if you had what I ordered and I am being unreasonable.\" To which he replies \" I do not make the rules.\" He could have said just about anything and it would have been better than that. \"Let me see what I can do,\" \" We will do it for you this one time\" etc... I then said that I did not want to really eat here and he replies \"go somewhere else and have a good night\" This is just another place that may have decent food but they will be out of business in a year because they do not know how to treat people. Stop going here and go to Heck Yeah BBQ it is phenomenal and the customer service is great. It is 10 times the BBQ and without the attitude."}
{"text":"One of my methods of rating barbeque is whether I'd come back. With this place, I'll be coming back again and again. The barbeque is average plus, far better than store bought but not as smokey and artistic as award winners. Where this place excels is its low prices. Its what took my vote from a 3 to 4 stars.  It would be great option for a cheap delicious lunch or quick dinner....plus the house sauce is pretty unique and tastes great."}
{"text":"Loved it! Tender, tasty and moist.  Meat fell right off the bone. Perfect for anyone who loves meat and eats a ketogenic diet.  There are fries and a couple of desserts but I didn't get any of those.  The place is cuter inside than out."}
{"text":"Here we are again and I'll reward them for consistency...my wife had the same meal and I had a very generous half pound of brisket. We were drinking water this time instead of tea. Same good food and service. Next time we're in town I'm sure we will do it again."}
{"text":"Wow- what an unexpected find in my Sunnyslope neighborhood. This place picks up the sales tax, so what you see on the ordering board is what you pay. I got the \"Pig\" sandwich for $3 and a side of potato salad for $1. The freshly made potato salad was a large size- I was surprised at the price. Now for the goods- the pork. Wow. It was so good. It even kept my attention while NBC news broadcasted Will and Kate present their baby to the world on TV. The pulled pork sandwich was deliciously smoky, soft and incredibly tender. It was served on a fresh French roll. I was surprised to find the BBQ sauce served in a container on the side apart from the sandwich. Make sense- kept the roll nice and soggy free for to enjoy at home. This is a tiny drive thru place in an old Sunnyslope taco shop before being re-opened at Waldos. I'm so happy it is here! I will definitely be back to try other items on the menu- especially the brisket which has been reviewed well. This is a definite \"MUST TRY\". I don't know of a great BBQ place anywhere else near here. Go support small business with the added bonus of cheap & delicious"}
{"text":"The sauce is delicious! The food was cooked on the spot fresh! Lastly the price is affordable"}
{"text":"Great barbeque at a super reasonable price! My current favorite for take-away 'cue.  Try the brisket or the hot links, both are excellent with deep smoky sweetness. Sides are good, too."}
{"text":"I've been here a couple of times, it's cool cause it's right by my house. I had awesome experience here in the past But Sunday wasn't all too good. when i was ordering through the drive thru, my boyfriend said man the prices went up said it a couple of times and i was discussing with him bout it. i know they could hear us through the microphone. and when we finished The guy at the window had no personality, no smile..when we got our food, My pig sandwich, when i opened it up, the bread was broken and hard the meat was all mess up had a little on one side and alot on the other, wasn't spreaded. gave us half cup of BBQ. and on top of everything, i had a thick black course hair in my sandwich, and im a blonde.. SO EVERYONE MAKE SURE WHAT YOU SAY THROUGH THE DRIVE THRU CAUSE THEY CAN DEFINITELY HEAR YOU. They might do something to your food.. you never know.  I will not be attending back at all."}
{"text":"I've been across the states a couple of times in my life, all the while eating as much food (mainly BBQ) as possible. I've never had a juicier pulled pork sandwich in my life as I've had at Waldo's off 7th street. It has the perfect amount of smoke flavor and you have to add your own BBQ sauce so it makes the sandwich that more personable. Speaking of their BBQ sauce, it's a sweet tangy combination of divinity that they make in house and sell by the mason jar. All of the sides are made from scratch as well. The service is amazing, fast, and very cheap for the amount of food you receive. I recommend any and all to go grab a pig or brisket sandwich from Waldo's and float on BBQ cloud 9!"}
{"text":"Stumbled upon this little place and what a surprise! Everything is so inexpensive and tasty - We had the pulled chicken sandwich and pork burrito, with the spicy BBQ sauce, and sides were Mac and cheese (just ok, kinda bland and noodles overcooked..), close slaw (he seemed to like it, I didn't try it), and sweet potato fries with ranch - those were super yummy. All sides are $1 (wow) except for the Sweet potato fries which are $2 and totally worth it. Will definitely go back!!"}
{"text":"I hate doing this but seriously, this is the worst bbq that I ever tried. Their sandwiches are cheap I'll give them that but they are also very small and tasteless. I went there for lunch and I actually bought 3 different sandwiches cause I wanted to try out different stuff. Long story short; I took one bite out of each sandwich and I threw them away. Fries were super old and soggy...I just can't find one positive about this place."}
{"text":"I was driving up 7th Street yesterday when I spied an old friend: Waldo's BBQ. I used to spend a lot of time in Mesa and ate at Waldo's Mesa location often. Discovering a Waldo's within 10 minutes of my house was as if the food gods were smiling down on me.  Waldo's Pig-N-Out location is set up a little different than their Mesa location: Pig-N-Out caters to the take-out and drive-through crowd. I ordered the Pig Sandwich and Cole Slaw. The bill was a measly four bucks. Granted, the size of the sandwich was a little smaller than the super-sized portions that ordinary fast food joints are pushing. If you have a big appetite you may want to order two.  For me (and my wife as well) the sandwich and slaw made a perfectly-sized meal.  And it was 4 bucks!  Waldo's uses their own unique sauce.  It's different from most BBQ joints.  My wife raved about the flavor and the fact that the sauce is served on the side so you can put on as much or little as you want.  If you like BBQ I strongly suggest you try Waldo's for their unique flavor.  I know that I'm going to be visiting Waldos very frequently."}
{"text":"Picked up lunch for the This Old Vape Shop crew. We are def bbq fanatics and now that we have discovered this place we will be coming back!   We are all so full and so happy with our food!!  The girl who took my order was very polite and friendy. Best part was the wait time was not as long as I anticipated.   $10 for a plateful of meat is probably the best deal I have ever had."}
{"text":"This is by far one of the best undiscovered secrets in the area. I got the sampler plater, two meat PLUS two ribs. Someone bring me a wheelbarrow because I need to roll myself out of here. Great food, the chicken was wonderful. Brisket was nice and smoky and the ribs!? By God good."}
{"text":"Not good and portions sucked. Ordered the platter and plate was small and brisket portion was non existent. Bbq ribs werent all that. Pulled pork portion sucked but was tasty..."}
{"text":"Not that great. Its cheap, sure, but the food can be improved. The pork is average, the beans are horrible, and the potato salad tastes like it's generic store bought. I give it 3 stars only because the prices adequately reflect the quality of the food. I believe that's fair."}
{"text":"My favorite place for a BBQ crave that doesn't break the bank.  You get high quality bbq for probably the best value in AZ.  Watch your orders though, as they tend to mess up often (but they give you things extra due to it so I'll let it slide)."}
{"text":"Place has really bomb bbq  Don't judge it by the outside though  Super quick and damn tasty bbq  Staff was friendly as well but i was there for the meat and it was impressive  A++ in my book"}
{"text":"very close to where i live and always satisfies my craving for bbq ribs. their macaroni and cheese is really good too. the wait isnt long at all. im thinking not enough people know how good this place is. oh well, more food for me! lol"}
{"text":"One of my favorites. Whenever I visit Phoenix I try to stop by. Price has gone up since last year but now still totally worth it."}
{"text":"Not the best bbq in the world but this place is good. The customer service is awesome the sides are really good too. I will continue to eat there."}
{"text":"Apparently, Pig N Out is the drive through version of Waldo's Bar B Que.  They have \"Pig\" sandwiches, pulled pork, brisket and chicken.  I had the brisket.  It was honestly, the juiciest brisket I have EVER had in my life.  It was wonderful.  There was even a little bit of burnt end in mine... YUM!  I'm not a fan of pork, but my friend said it was very good.   The potato salad was pretty good.  The cole slaw was a sweet style that is not my favorite, but it was ok.  It had way too much dressing though.  I especially liked the sauce.  It was just spicy enough with a good touch of smoke and sweet.  They served mine on the side.  I don't know if that is par for the course or not because my friend ordered hers on the side, but it was DELICIOUS.    The meats were perfect.... and that's why you go to a BBQ place, right?   That combined with excellent sauce and the really good prices earns Pig N Out more of my business.  It's nice to see an old taco stand being put to good use."}
{"text":"I love BBQ and Waldo's Pig-n-Out satisfied that crave. I see the reviews regarding the small portions, but apparently they now have a large sandwich which has double the meat. The pork sandwich was $6 and the brisket was $7. I got the large and it was plenty for me. That is still very reasonable for BBQ. I would say it is more of a take out place. The sauce is really good, the kind I like.I would recommend this place to everyone and I hope everyone goes so it will stay in business. I see the are open for breakfast, too."}
{"text":"Very convenient however their BBQ at this location is probably some of the worst.  Te brisket was way over done and dry as well as being cut extremely thin.  If you are coining to sale it by the pound it should be sold like it thicker cuts.  The chicken on the other hand was ok.  If not for the chicken I would not have even given them 2 stars.  I hope there BBQ Sauce I good?  Because if they are counting on the meat, they are DOOMED and destined for failure!"}
{"text":"Go elsewhere!!!!!!!!! Dry meat, small portions for the price. The mcrib at mcdonalds is better. I ended up here cuz dickies was closed. I had the brisket sandwich spicy fries and ice tea. The tea was good that's about it. I won't be going back."}
{"text":"We dropped into Waldo's for some pre-bowling dinner the other night and were not disappointed. The staff is very friendly, the food is tasty, and the prices are very reasonable!  I had the ribs with a side of mac and cheese - the ribs were incredible, and the mac and cheese was tasty. Not the best I've ever had, but still decent.  My boyfriend had the brisket sandwich with a side of potato salad, he enjoyed every bite.  All of the above, plus drinks came to $14 - as far as I'm concerned that's amazing for a bbq joint."}
{"text":"Solid BBQ and the price is right. Don't be put off by the sketchy location. I tried the place because it was local and have continued to return since. That's usually the most basic test. I doubt anyone will leave here thinking Best BBQ On Earth just because bbq snobs are even worse than pizza snobs (!) but I rate it a solid Very Good and it's a place that will definitely be in my rotation for the future. Five stars because this is the type of local shop that needs to be supported. They do a great job, serve good barbecue, and don't charge through the nose. Not impressed with the ribs so much (could have got a bad piece??) but the sandwiches are awesome. The menu prices are really good. Sides are a dollar, sandwiches are four or five dollars. Everything is even dollar amounts with tax added in. The quality of the food is vastly better than just about any fast food place out there and is cheaper on average.  The pig sandwich with the spicy sauce is my favorite. The cowboy beans are really good too but I'd rate the mac'n'cheese as bland. The only complaint I have is that the fresh-cut fries tend to be soggy if you don't remember to ask for extra crispy. Really cool little place. Slip through their drive-through instead of McDonald's and tell me you don't regret all the times you could've been eating good food instead..."}
{"text":"What an awesome concept. An express BBQ drive thru (or dine in) that's open when I'm actually hungry! After a morning hike I'm in the mood for some meat!  Usually wait until restaurants open at 11 but today I decided to use the Yelp 'open now' search filter and found this miracle BBQ joint.  They were open since 6am although hours will be 1030am starting 05-31-2016.      I've been going to Waldo's in Mesa and Scottsdale (SW corner of Hayden & Thomas (remember that place?)) for 18 years now.  Didn't realize I had this express option available on the North side of town until using the Yelp 'open now' feature on the Yelp app. Hint: \"Open now\" search also lets you change the time manually to any time of day.       The food is AMAZING and always so consistent. This is identical to the food in the Mesa location and what an awesome meal it made!  The St. Louis ribs are so tender you can just eat them with a fork.  Light rub, tender and super filling....that's why I only got 1.  Meat by the lb. is available so I ordered 1 rib and 1/2 lb.  brisket.        I saved half of the brisket for dinner.  Put it in a pan, let the fat melt a little then threw in the 2 BBQ  sauces they gave me. Let the sauce simmer, reduce a little then BAM!  Food crack!  It was so good I forgot to take a picture, just imagine it on a wild-flower ciabatta roll and you have 1 awesome BBQ sandwich."}
{"text":"I'm not a big BBQ person, but I always enjoy Waldo's. The prices are reasonable and the food tastes authentic - nothing fake about it. This location has great service and fresh food. I love their potato salad, cowboy beans, BBQ sauce, and pulled pork sandwiches. I'm not a big fan of French fries either, but their Cajun fries are tasty."}
{"text":"I hate to admit that I have eaten here three times and every time the bbq is just really not good.  My ribs were way over cooked the last time with very little flavor and lots of fat. The pork and chicken sandwiches seemed to either be a couple days old or just plain bad meat as the texture and flavor was not good.   In addition the the descriptions above, some other information that will hopefully be helpful:  Pros - drive thru (the reason I have been there multiple times), prices are very reasonable if you stick with the sandwiches, sweet potato fries are good and the staff always seems friendly   Cons - bbq is not good, Mac & cheese is chalky and even my kids won't eat it, fries are soggy   In summary, I won't be back and without the drive through I would have not given them a second chance."}
{"text":"Unfortunately I am not able to actually review the food or restaurant because contrary to what the website says they are actually closed today, but that's only if you can get past the fact that they only have half of their actual menu at this location."}
{"text":"A hour and a half after accepting our order and us not receiving it, I check grub hub and it says the restaurant has closed but I can pick up my food at the window on the right side of the building. I have no phone calls, texts, or emails telling me there is or will be a problem with my order. I call the restaurant and the young woman tells me the driver should be back at the store in 10 minutes but she had no idea how long it will take for my food to arrive. She then says she will check and call me back. A man calls me from a cell phone and tells me I can go get my food (that they changed me a delivery fee for) or cancel my order. The man then informs me, they don't have a driver, they hire a delivery company to deliver their food, and it is not their fault or in their control if the food gets delivered. But they advertise on grub hub as having delivery. That's why I ordered food to be delivered from them! No apologies, just this is not our fault, they obviously also feel it's not their problem. I won't eat at any of their locations again. Horrible customer service. If you take orders that you can't fulfill, you tell the customer, you apologize, you don't wait for them to call you and then blame others. Ridiculous."}
{"text":"Pretty good BBQ. I have been here 7-8 times and I've never been let down.   I usually get a sampler platter with ribs, brisket and pulled pork. It's big enough to share. I got a hot link once and it was tasty. I tried the chicken and it was ok, but I like the pork and beef better. I like their original sauce a lot. Not too sweet with some vinegar bite. But they have jerk sauce that is spicier that is good too.   The fries are excellent. The mac and cheese is decent. The beans are okay but have too much sauce for my taste. The only item I don't like here is the coleslaw. I prefer less mayo/dressing.The cheesecake is pretty good but not exceptional. It tastes like a mix.   Prices are reasonable for a BBQ joint. Some BBQ restaurants can be expensive."}
{"text":"Too greasy, fatty and unflavorful for my picky palate, but I must must mention that I am not the biggest BBQ fan, my husband is and he gets food to go from Waldo's at least once a week."}
{"text":"Really good food and I have been in here a few times and I do have to say, the young men that work here are very nice and easy to talk to every time. Just want to say thank you to them for being good people. Great food also."}
{"text":"Great place! The meat and Bbq sauce was fantastic. Husband got sampler plate with a side of Cole slaw."}
{"text":"I am Waldo's biggest fan but the food here is a complete disappointment!  Waldo's in Mesa is the best bbq anywhere with its fall off the bone chicken.  This Waldo's isn't worth the drive."}
{"text":"Second visit - worse than the first.  Ordered ribs.  They should call them boiled ribs instead of BBQ ribs.  Fatty, greasy and pink with no BBQ char at all.  So bad I let the dogs eat some and threw the rest away.  I made myself two pieces of toast instead."}
{"text":"Amazing food. Very clean. Great service! The pulled pork is incredible and the mason jar cheesecakes are wonderful. I would recommend."}
{"text":"I got the pulled pork, brisket and 2 ribs with coleslaw for 11 bucks. Wow. It was so good it melted in my mouth! This is my go to bbq place now."}
{"text":"Been here numerous x's throughout the years, the food is usually outstanding as well is the sauce for a place so small and unassuming. Great to have in the neighborhood and is nice to have an option for some inexpensive quality BBQ in the area. They do smoke their meat as you can see they have a smoker behind the counter."}
{"text":"OVER PRICED, EXTREMELY SMALL PORTIONS.   Left the sketchy drive short time ago and will never return. Spent $17 on the worst meal for my family. The ribs UNDER COOKED, the brisket sandwich was 3 small THIN slices, hotlink sandwich was 2 itty bitty parts of 1 hotlink itself.   How cheap can you be? You can get a FULL brisket for $15 at Fry's Grocery down the street? The bread it came on most likely cost more from the amount of \"meat\" on the sandwich.   How does this place stay in business? The hospital down the street provides majority of its customers, but none are returning customers!  You can find WAY better quality anywhere else, STAY AWAY. LISTEN AND STAY AWAY."}
{"text":"Went here last night because it was close. Pulled pork was good but the bread had a lot to be desired. I expected a bun but got what looked like uncooked French bread. You know the kind of French bread you buy in the store that you have to throw in the oven to beown. Bread was mushy tasteless. If I had wanted a sub I would have went to a sub store. Very very disappointed. Will definitely remember not to go here again."}
{"text":"If you cooked it in an oven, it's a roast. How can you serve a roast and call it barbq? By putting cheap sauce on it, apparently. Greasy bland sausage and roast beef with ketchup... Welcome to fake barbq.  At least it's cheap and fast."}
{"text":"Restaurant was clean and smelled amazing. Ordered the pulled chicken sandwich to go and it was so good I almost went back and bought another."}
{"text":"Fast food BBQ? Sounds like a gamble.  I have been a regular since they opened. My co-workers are now regulars too.  They serve their meat without sauce on it but give you plenty to pour on. The sauce is pretty tasty.  I'm not going to say it is the best BBQ ever because BBQ is too subjective. I will say I've been to places that are WAY more expensive and reviewed well that weren't as good as this place. I am willing to say that I don't think you'll find a better BBQ joint in this price range. The menu is simple.   My only con: Mac and cheese was a bummer."}
{"text":"Thank you for catering the Woman in Business Chandler Chamber of Commerce event today. The BBQ lunch of pulled pork sandwiches and all the fixins was absolutely delicious. The staff was kind and efficient and I would definitely recommend your menu and service for a catering event."}
{"text":"I drove here from East Phoenix to get all the way home to discover that I got 3 pieces of fat for each of my 2 brisket sandwiches. I called back to inform the cashier of the issue. She then told me to drive all the way back to her to bring the sandwiches back. After, telling her that I live in East Phoenix so bringing the sandwiches back wasn't a option. She then asked for my number and told me the owner would contact me. At this time I told her that I was going to post pictures of these ridiculous sandwiches to yelp. She then said that's fine and to send her pictures as well. I asked if I could get a credit or something. She said that the owner MIGHT call me if he felt it was a issue!! WTF, what kind of business is this. After, sending the pictures to her, i then get a text messages stating that I have a credit. So to all that reads this!!! Stay away from this place! Or never order brisket!!!"}
{"text":"This was my first time here. I went through the drive thru which was speedy. I got the sampler and the meal special. It was all amazing and very tender. The extra bbq sauce on the side could have been warned but other then that I can't complain. The guy at the drive thru was very nice"}
{"text":"Good for a quick BBQ sandwich around this area. Always clean when we come here. Service is fast and friendly."}
{"text":"To be honest, I wasn't expecting much. I just moved here from Memphis, a city known for its BBQ. Seriously, there are over 100 BBQ joints in the city limits and it's a much smaller city than Phoenix...they're not messing around. But Waldo's is close to my house and had decent reviews, so I figured why not. I'll give it a try for a Sunday night meal, but I didn't think I'd be that impressed.  I'm not too proud to admit when I'm wrong. So here goes: I was wrong.  The menu is simple and small, which made ordering a breeze. My husband and I split a brisket sandwich and hot fries and ordered a side of mac n cheese too. I like that they offer the sandwiches \"Memphis Style\" as well, AKA with slaw on top. They're not lying--most places in Memphis make their sandwiches with slaw, but my belly isn't cut out for cabbage, so we didn't try theirs. The brisket itself was chopped and had tons of flavor. I didn't put the sauce on the sandwich because it didn't need it on every bite, but when I dipped it, the sauce proved to be as good as the brisket. It was spicy but not too intense for most. The hot fries on the other hand..man, those suckers got really spicy after a while. They seemed to have cayenne or something sprinkled on them and were really tasty dipped in the ranch that they provided. The mac n cheese was really creamy, not that gross hardened cheese, stuck together stuff you find at some other places.  Over all I was really pleased. I love the round prices: our was $7 even. The only thing was bugged me was that I couldn't find the menu for this location online, only the larger location in  Mesa. They have a more extensive menu, so I arrived hoping they had fried okra, which they didn't. I'd love a menu for their location on their website to avoid confusion, but it's a minor annoyance for such tasty, affordable BBQ."}
{"text":"This place is delicious and fast!  Try the Mac n cheese. It's a bit spicy for kids but the green chili mixed in was the perfect touch."}
{"text":"Had Mac n cheese tonite. Bought three. One buck each. Added some BBQ sauce. Yum!!!! You cannot go wrong for price and such tasty food."}
{"text":"So I'm basically a barbecue aficionado and have been to most of the barbecue joints in the greater Phoenix Valley. Waldo's BBQ Express on 7th Street is in a very unassuming neighborhood with a very very unassuming building. Very small and old but I must say this is a real and authentic barbecue joint. We both had their beef brisket sandwich, with different sides coleslaw and potato salad. One reviewer states that the portion sizes were extremely small. When the sandwich comes it does look like a very small sandwich but by the time you're through eating it you realize that they have put a very adequate portion of beef in it. This brisket is done the correct way with the pink stripe and rich smoky flavor. I see they have multiple locations which brings me to a point that I've noticed with several of the barbecue restaurant companies in the Phoenix Valley. Like some of the other authentic cue joints,it seems as though it was not done freshly and recently. Perhaps like it was done the previous day and then transported over to this location. To back that up you don't see any smokers in the parking lot as you will see with a lot of the companies. So although it wasn't the largest portion the price was $6 which is relatively inexpensive compared to some of its competitors. The side salads of potato and coleslaw we're good tasting but rather standard and almost supermarketish, in their flavor and textures. Service time was adequate and punctual."}
{"text":"My family and I really enjoy Waldo's BBQ. We think portion size to price is spot on. I love the pulled chicken, and their BBQ sauces are good. Their cheesecake in the mason jars are enjoyable, nice treat to compliment your meal."}
{"text":"Good quick barbecue drive through spot great   customer service,  pulled pork sandwich was just on point, Good food at a great price,  looking forward to stopping in again to try something else on the menu I strongly recommend..."}
{"text":"The bbq here is the best I've had! The ribs are tender down to the bone! And their sauces are delicious as well! The staff is also very friendly they gave me a run down on the menu items since it was my first time here."}
{"text":"Great little Express barbecue place. Very good food excellent service and very inexpensive. Will definitely be coming back. Highly recommend trying it. Wish they would open one in North Scottsdale."}
{"text":"Good spot on the west side. Same as the one on 7th street but independently franchised not corporate store. But still does a good"}
