{"text":"Very good food. Owner can prepare any item you may like it. Fresh and testy. Good for carry out or dine in. I will recommend visit once."}
{"text":"The best Indian cuisine we have ever tried!!! The service is super friendly too. We are definitely repeat customers and this is out go-to place for Indian food!"}
{"text":"Excellent Indian cuisine. Freshly prepared to your taste and cooked to perfection. Arguably the best Indian food you can get if you are in the Toronto area. Do yourself a favor and dine there!"}
{"text":"if you want Indian food that will tackle your tastebuds too the ground (in a good way), this is one of the best spots to do so! The best butter chicken in town for all of you butter chicken fanatics out there! The food has a nice homely vibe to it yet at the same time has that professional chef touch. If you like spicy food they even have a spice meter. I got 7 on the butter chicken and it that was a little bit too spicy for me. Go for a 5 or 6 if you like that heat kick. Overall, good spot with amazing food! Check it out!"}
{"text":"Try weekly service with Ancila!   Her Naans are favorite in my home, try aloo naan!  Her customer service is the key and food is Cooked with love!"}
{"text":"Best Indian food we've ever had! The food was fresh, tasty and melted in your mouth! Thank you so much for a fantastic experience!"}
{"text":"Great food! Ancila took our order, and since it was our first time she explained that she doesn't do menus. She was very kind and told us that she prefers to talk with the customer to see what they like and puts together a suggested menu and then cooks it. So fresh! We had an eggplant dish, an okra dish, and a daal dish, rice, naan and pakoras. Mango juice and a sweet lassi drink. Everything was delicious! Preferred the okra over the eggplant but we would definitely come back!"}
{"text":"All of the food is made fresh.  The only issue is that there is only one lady working and we were there for 1 1/2 hours.  She asked us about the spice level and there are no menus to look at."}
{"text":"Glad I had an opportunity to try a new restaurant this evening. Absolutely fantastic meal, had the butter chicken, samosas and channa masala. Everything was incredibly fresh and flavourful. It's a shame I live out of town as I would definitely make this a regular spot. The owner was friendly, passionate about food and chatted with me about the meal. If you like good spicy flavourful food, then I recommend this place."}
{"text":"There is only one way to describe Ancila and her food and it is OUTSTANDING.   Ancila was my caterer for a dinner party of about 50 people. We first went to her restaurant to meet her, try the food, etc. before placing our big order. She was so warm and welcoming, and we were instantly blown away by the quality and freshness of her food (even my mom - the best cook in the world- was impressed... which says a lot!). She offered excellent advice on putting together a menu which would be perfect for the guests, and was so thoughtful about every detail. The price was also very reasonable for the quality and amount of food we ordered. Ancila remained in communication leading up to the event, and happily answered any questions that I had.   On the day of event, the food was ready and hot right at the time we agreed to pick it up. My guests LOVED the food - they were raving about it - and several asked for Ancila's contact information for future catering events. Ancila even followed up with me afterwards to see how everything went. I cannot stress enough how amazingly positive this whole experience was... we look forward to going back for dinner soon to thank Ancila in person!"}
{"text":"Sometimes you find ratings inflated or too good to be true. This is NOT the case with Ancila's.  I was in town overnight to pick up my wife and friend from Toronto airport and was in need of a good meal. I chose Ancila's due to the close proximity to my hotel and the resounding consensus that this was the place to eat in Missasaugua.   Ancila's is located in a small strip of shops and restaurants. Please note there is a side door that steals you a peek into the kitchen. I was immediately intrigued and sorely disappointed, albeit momentarily, seeing a \"Closed for private event\" sign hanging on that door. Fortunately, I walked past the front door as I thought I would have to settle for the Asian restaurant next door. The front door had no such sign and I walked straight into an intimate dining room, conservatively decorated in stark contrast to what I normally associate with Indian restaurants.  Curtains draped from the ceiling create each table's own private seating. I was greeted by the hostess within a few minutes of arriving, only having to wait due to the fact that she is also the bartender, waiter, and sous chef.   After staking my claim to the table of my choice, I ordered a Kingfisher beer, was served a plate of complementary pappadam, and began one of the most memorable dining experiences of my life.  This restaurant is meant to be savored, so do not plan to rush it. You will wait, but the wait is worth all the while. There were two or three couples seated around the perimeter and in the middle of the dining room was a large party of eight or ten. This fact is key because, as I mentioned, peering through the kitchen revealed only two women running the whole kitchen and come to find out, the whole show. One after the next, I saw all the dishes come out and served to the central table and could not wait to order.  Following the last dish out of her kitchen was Ancila to take my order.    Ancila knows what you want. Trust me, she does because there are no printed menu's.  After a few questions about spice persuasion and meat preference she retreats as quickly as she appeared to begin your meal.  One more Kingfisher ordered and my meal arrived table side.  Spiced basmati with remnants hinting her recipe's secrets of toasted cinnamon stick, clove, and whole black pepper. Tender fish curry with a decadent, silky brown gravy with bits of fresh tomato, ginger and green curry leaf.  All accompanied by the complementary fresh Naan and the cold Kingfisher made for a symphony as sweet as the classical music playing subtlety in the background.    I thought I would include a note for ordering and spice levels. As other's have noted, levels range from 1 to 10. Now I like spicy food and I ordered conservatively at a level 5 to 6. At first it left me wanting more heat, however it will build as you eat and it allowed me to fully enjoy the full array of flavors.  Bottom line, go here. You will not regret it.  There are no menu's to browse while you wait in anticipation. There are no televisions playing the latest Bollywood hits.  There is no need to distract from what you are meant to experience, which is definitively Ancila and her food.   I will definitely make a return trip with my wife, even if it means making the two and a half hour drive, just to eat here.   **For those looking to get a taste of her food quickly, whether it be a time restraint or just impatience, follow as other reviews state and call ahead to place your order."}
{"text":"Warning: no menus. Chef comes out and chats you up and out comes food that hits the spot. Great authentic, delicious food that breaks away from all the bland chain restaurants in the area. My go-to Indian place from now on."}
{"text":"Called and she was closed.  She calls back and asked if i wanted takeout. Sure I days. Butter chicken ok she says. Fine with me. I arrive and she asked what spice level. I say white boy spice and she laughed. I say 3 out of 10 and it was perfect. Amazing flavour. Not too much heat. Nice lady."}
{"text":"Very unique take on dining. As other reviewers have stated, Ancila takes your order, customized to your interest. Service took about 45 min for the food to arrive. When it arrived it was fantastic. Very different than your run of the mill Indian restaurants that use the same sauce for multiple dishes, you can really tell that each dish is custom crafted. Best Indian food I've ever had!! This will be our new go to place for Indian food"}
{"text":"Amazing just amazing it is food made on the spot for you! Just amazing. Wow. I'm hoping Ancila will teach me how to make it!!! Great women! Well done!"}
{"text":"This restaurant is a bit odd...a drastic departure from the well oiled machines that are most corporate restaurants today. Overall, the food was really good! The service was very friendly, but very slow...this just seems to be the way they run things...very 'relaxed'. So, if you're not in a rush & want what seems to be a home cooked Indian meal, then it's definitely worth a try!"}
{"text":"Food was fresh and very delicious!! I had the chicken biryani, nana and raita. I will definitely go again."}
{"text":"I do not usually review much but wow what an amazing food. Being from india i am picky and by far best food tasted."}
{"text":"If your looking to experience some magical, soulful, healing food, you have to visit Ancila's! I've been a regular patron for the past 5+ years & the cusine has been nothing but perfection, catered to your liking.   The restaurant is fully owned and run by Ancila herself. Ancila is more than just a good chef, she's really like a food artist, & adds her own flare and touch, along with her secret ingredients (passion and love) to each dish she prepares, which are always made fresh upon order, resulting in some of the finest Indian cuisine you will ever experience!  From her renown Butter Chicken, to her Lamb Biryani, Special Chilli Paneer, Chicken Kebabs (Saturday only), Baingan Bharta (Eggplant vegetable)... & the list goes on.. but let's not forget one of the side stars on the menu.. the NAAN Bread! (Which just melts in your mouth!)  All I can say is, if you're ever looking to enjoy some realllly good food, or need a pick-me-upper, or some soul/healing/home-style cooked meal!.. You gotta visit Ancila's!  ***Keep in mind, Ancila runs the whole place by herself (Yes, by herself!, I don't know how she does it, but she does), so if you're planning on making your way there, IT'S BEST YOU CALL HER AHEAD OF TIME SO SHE KNOWS & CAN PREPARE FOR YOU (IF YOU'VE GOT YOUR ORDER READY, LIKE ME, EVEN BETTER), OR SO SHE CAN ADVISE YOU WHETHER SHE'S GOT A FULL HOUSE OR NOT!  I hope you enjoyed reading this review, but I wish even more that you go to Ancila's and experience for yourself, and write your own. You may just get hooked, like myself & all of her other regular patrons!  Bon Apetit!"}
{"text":"Let me tell you that this place is incredible. This is the second time I've been to this restaurant, and it completely blew me away for a second time. My sister and I came in the other day and we were in a bit of a hurry. She informed us about the dishes that could be quickly prepared, and it took her about 15 minutes to prepare both dishes. We had the yellow lentil dish and the butter chicken. Both were delicious. Additionally, the owner/chef is so incredibly kind. If you have specific needs, please be vocal about it. She is more than happy to help. Finally, I would highly recommend this restaurant. It's probably one of the best Indian restaurants in Mississauga. So Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Delicious food, great quality, and always a nice surprise -- the downside, a little overpriced at times (a curry with shrimp for almost 18 dollars, and only 7 undercooked shrimp). Stick with chicken and you won't be disappointed. Always, always call ahead."}
{"text":"Wow....what a great find.  Some of the most authentic Indian Cuisine that I have had in a while.  Having the Owner and Chef come out and explain that she will cook for you based on her interview of you and there is no menus, this exudes confidence and swagger. The food did not disappoint. A must stop for the serious foodie."}
{"text":"I read the reviews here about calling ahead, and that was the best advice. Ancila is truly talented, and everything is always so fresh - you can tell after dining at other very busy Indian restaurants. I had a bad experience once with the naan, which seemed to be made with an entirely different flour and completely changed the taste. My concern was met with denial, and no offer to make things right, despite being a regular customer."}
{"text":"Wow! We wanted a place to celebrate R's annual 29th birthday, and this was a great choice! Don't be in a hurry, call ahead, and be prepared for amazing flavors. \"What heat/spice do you like?\" asks Ancila. Choose on a scale of ten. \"What do you like to eat? Meat, fish, vegetarian?\" We chose two meats, but I'm certain everything wonderful. The rice and nan we're the best ever. You'll be greeted by smiles, and leave feeling happy. Thank you Ancila!"}
{"text":"While traveling on business I decided to be adventurous and try Indian food for the first time. I have to tell you that this place set the bar HIGH. This was some of the best food I've ever had!!!!  The service was also excellent. The owner/chef spoke to me for a while about my preferences (heat level, types of meats, etc) and then brought me what she thought I would like...and she was dead on. It was a slow night, so I ended up visiting with her and another patron for probably 2 hours. I'll definitely go back next time I'm in the area."}
{"text":"Dirty place, foods are overpriced and over cooked, too much spice, we stopped going there few years back. The owner is also super rude, stay away!"}
{"text":"Listen, the place is run by one lady, so give a little slack on the service-front, but the food is spot-on.  Flavours smack you in the face, in a good \"Carousel\" kind of way (seriously, watch that movie and tell me the ghost dad slapping his wayward daughter isn't the most f'd up thing in a 1950's musical you've ever watched).  But I digress...  Ancila will chat with you and describe how she found herself cooking food for a living (something she never intended), and then you just sit back and enjoy the results of the happenstances that led her here.  She encourages you to call in your order, so it's ready for dine in when you arrive, or for takeout - there's no menu, she'll recommend dishes based on what she does well and what she has in the way of ingredients that day, just trust and try.  The channa masala, specifically, is just amazing.  Only negative is that she now closes on Sundays, which makes it harder for me to enjoy her food."}
{"text":"Outstanding restaurant!  There was no menu; the owner/chef provided me with a customized meal based on my preferences. Very tasty food - full of spice and flavor."}
{"text":"Loved my experience here! They will come out and have a chat about the kind of food you like and then do a custom dish! Appreciate the homely vibe and focus on quality. Just a heads up - if you can't wait around 30-40 minutes for your food to be prepared, call ahead!"}
{"text":"Ok this place had some good reviews.  I was tired, didn't want to drive far, so gave it a shot.  Located in a strip mall (hmmm...).  Walk in - place is dead quiet, diners are quiet..... hmmmm.  A nice woman comes out and tells us they don't have menus.  Ok...  She starts asking questions \"do you like vegetarian or meat?\"  \"How spicy, from 1 to 10?\".  She make some recommendations - we told her to do what she thought best.  Waited a while for the food - what can be taking so long?......  Food comes - oh Heavenly Father - this is incredible.  I wish I could remember the names of what we had.  Dishes prepared with just the right amount of heat we specified.  The chicken dish we had was out of this world.    Definitely, definitely will come again."}
{"text":"Amazing food. I don't know how to describe my experience. As it was already pointed out the dining experience is personalize. The chef came to see us and she was an absolute gem. But the best part, obviously, was the food. Such an amazing experience. Extremely tasty, fresh food. There was so much taste in each bite. I hope to be in town one day again"}
{"text":"My husband and I were staying near by for a business trip and decided to stop by for supper one night, one word AMAZING! when we walked in we  didn't realize there was no menu, we were confused, and then we were notify that Ancila's herself was going to take our order and cook it. My husband loves spicy food, so he had some spicy lamb and I like decently spicy food so she complimented his lamb with the chicken I had. I forgot what it was called because we threw away our receipt but we didn't stop talking about the food until we left Canada! Will be stopping by again!"}
{"text":"Ancila's is my favourite indian restaurant in Mississauga. Freshest food around! Every dish is made to order and customized to your spice preference. The owner is a lovely woman with a warm heart and her passion for what she does is evident. Highly recommend. Call ahead to avoid the wait!"}
{"text":"Ancila's is a personal favourite of mine and the food is always cooked fresh to order. While theres usually wait times of 30-40 mins the food comes out fresh and has never dissapointed.  Today we had the beef karahi and the chicken briyani both spice level 5 which was more than enough for me and my girlfriend. I can usually handle 5 but next time ill have the spice at level 3.   Btw shes on vacation july 9 2017 to aug 9 2017 on a journey to find new dishes for the restaurant."}
{"text":"Holy shit this is good.  No menu, super authentic, the owner will talk to you to know your preferences, and cook it fresh.   Appetizer: 4/5. No idea what it is. Fried mixture of potato and onions with spice sprinkled all over. Good but a bit greasy.  Chicken masala: 4.5/5. Chicken breast, a bit sweet, creamy.   Chicken kahari: 5/5. Thank god I found this dish. Chicken thigh, full of spice, ground ginger, aromatic. A miracle.  Garlic naan: 4.5."}
{"text":"The price is a bit high, but I will say the food is awesommmme... The owner is the chef and also the server lol. It takes long time to be served since all the food is fresh prepared and made. I believe that's why the food is so good. Butter chicken and mango lassi is my favorite. Suggestion is call and order before you go."}
{"text":"Homemade, delicious Indian cuisine. Have patience with ordering and you will be greatly rewarded. Ancila is truly a doll."}
{"text":"We caught the chef as she just came back from India so she wasn't serving dine-in, but she made an exception for us and let us in. Ancila is so kind and thoughtful in her cooking and can custom your dish to the meat you like and specific spice level.  We got the Chicken Vindaloo, Chicken Tikka Masala and Lamb Karahi, with some garlic & butter naan and rice. The dishes feel very authentic and are cooked to perfection. The meat is incredibly tender, juicy and works well with the sauce. You can call the chef ahead so she can take the time to prepare your custom dish. It feels very homey and how an Indian mom would make it!  I would highly recommend this place and it's well worth the drive from the city of your don't live in Mississauga! Ancila also does large party catering and take out, which can be all ordered ahead."}
{"text":"Great Indian food. Owner who is the cook comes to your table and asks you several questions. She takes it from that point on. Only thing I had to decide on whether chicken, lamb or beef and how spicy you like your food. Fresh hot food! The best! Not fancy and since food is being prepared on the spot. Expect some time for food to come to your table. Nan bread is the best I've ever had and fresh."}
{"text":"Great place.. the best thing is the food is custom made for you by Ancilla.. its a different kind of experience!! Take ypur time when u visit and enjoy your meal.."}
{"text":"Great food! Unique experience!! Went with my hubby and MIL to the place post a movie. Decided to wing it, considering it was our first visit to the place. We were prepared to head out elsewhere if we didn't get a table. However only a handful of tables were occupied, so we were glad it wasn't a trouble. But the chef/hostess told us it'll take at least half an hour for her  to even talk to us about our meal options. Honestly we were a little intrigued! Meal options?? Whatever happened to menus? Anyway, it was only 7.30pm so we were ok to wait it out and see for ourselves what she meant. The simple ambience, decent lighting and soothing music were catalysts in ensuring our time passed quickly enough. When the chef could finally talk to us, we told her that it was the first time we were visiting, and would like to know the MO of the place. She cheerfully explained that she didn't do menus, as she cooked each dish fresh, and as per every customer's preference. The starting point is the spice levels in each dish (ranging from 1-10) upon which she builds up the order - veg, non-veg, type of meat/vegetables, dry, gravy etc. We ordered pakoras for starters, a veg gravy (Paneer takatak) for my MIL, a non-veg dish (Chicken something) for ourselves and rotis (Indian bread) for all. Honestly, by the time the meal arrived, we were ravenous and polished off the whole thing in a heartbeat. The chef/hostess was attentive without being intrusive and chatted with us while we were having our dinner. The whole experience was quite different and we enjoyed the freshly prepared simple fare. Will be definitely visiting again!!  P.S: Spotted quite a few take away orders being delivered (seemingly to regulars) while we were waiting. Remember to make reservations beforehand. You would get a slot allotted specifically for you and dishes made according to your palate!!"}
{"text":"I went to this restaurant with high expectations (mostly based on the high reviews here, and on other sites), but sadly I was let down.   The service: The service here is almost non-existent as there is only two people at most who run the restaurant at a given time, and one of them is the cook/owner. The one person who serves predominately has no manners whatsoever and isn't that strong with English sometimes making it hard to ask questions etc.   The food: The food was a huge let down for me as I was really hoping for something spectacular, we ordered the Chicken Bihari and Chicken Tikka Masala. Both these dishes fell below my expectations as they lacked the taste that I'm used to from these dishes from the other restaurants I've been to. Considering you have to wait for quite an extensive amount of time for the food; it doesn't correlate with what I was served.   The prices: The prices are a little high based on the food and level of service, for two people we paid close to $60 (I should add I paid $2 for soda that came from a 2L bottle and served to me in a small glass). Needless to say thats a little funny seeing considering you're at a fully established restaurant.   I would probably skip this place and try another Indian restaurant in the area."}
{"text":"The best indian food ever. This is even better than having in India.  We had the butter chicken Naan and karahi lamb. Biryani is to die for. Definitely visiting again for such awesome preparation."}
{"text":"Called to see if they were open and they were closed  Called right back and took a pick up order Great service great food made to order for my son who had not liked Indian good before His butter chicken was delicious"}
{"text":"This was such a unique place. I eat all over the world and I rarely write restaurant reviews but I really need to for this place.  I was travelling on business with two other colleagues and we came here not knowing what to expect.  A woman came out and said, \"I'll ask you what you like and then I'll cook for you.\"  We went through a list...what spice level do we like, which meats, which vegetables, and she provided recommendations on dishes she would make that all complemented each other.  I think it was a beef curry, some amazing thing with shrimp that I ate enthusiastically even though  I don't really like shrimp, and butter chicken, which she said would balance out the spices but I would have never selected it on my own.  In fact, I typically go for my usual favorites and this was such a great way to open me up to something new. And it was FABULOUS! The 3 of us were still talking about it the next day.    We got up to check out not knowing what the price would be (not really caring, expense account!), and the dinner with 3 meat dishes, 1 veggie dish, appetizer, naan, rice, and mango lassi's x 3 was just $90.  TOTALLY reasonable.  I wish I lived here as I would come back often.  It was really great.  Loved it.   I am not sure how they do it with just 2 people (that we saw) and I thought that our service was reasonably paced with only one other couple in there that was wrapping up their meal.  Definitely not a place to go if you are in the rush.  A place to go to savor and enjoy. When we were leaving, she said that next time, we should call ahead. Not sure why, but I'll suggest that as well!"}
{"text":"The taste here really sets a high benchmark for other Indian restaurants! Hands down, one of my most favourite restaurants in Ssauga. Ancila is a kind lady, who's the server, the cook, and also the owner.  We got lucky on a Saturday night, an hour before closing as we were alone and Ancila helped us pick the right dish that we were looking for. It's her questioning and getting to know you better helps her guide you to pick the dish that you're looking for. She first asked us the spice level (1-10) and then what kind of dish we were looking for (meat, fish, vegetable etc). She suggested us the combo of beef karahi with dry potato subji along with garlic naan! The aroma from karahi gravy instantly tells you that it's made right on the spot with fresh ingredients! The meat was tender (absolutely not chewy like many indian restaurants) and full of flavours. The potato subji, dry cooked in hint of masalas with onion, green chilli and fresh coriander was also extraordinary. The smell of coriander infused with green chillies was just mouthwatering! The thickness, smell and taste consistencies of the naan was just perfect. No burnt, no chewy and absolutely fresh out of the tandoor oven! It is a relatively expensive place and wait time is bit long but if you're looking for an authentic Indian taste, skip all the restaurants in the area and go to this one!"}
{"text":"It was our first time at Ancila's. The experience was great. Ancila is very pleasant and friendly and accommodated us although we didn't  have a reservation. She is really a gifted cook and prepared the most delicious Indian food that we've ever eaten in town. Definitely a hidden gem in Mississauga. We can't wait to go back again!"}
{"text":"TIP:  Make reservations.  It's primarily a 1-woman operation, so owner prefers to know when you're coming!  First, you don't come here for the food, but more for the EXPERIENCE.  Don't get me wrong, the food is delicious, freshly prepared, but that's not the *main* reason for your visit.  The rumours are true.  There's no menu here at Ancila's.  Instead, Ancila herself comes out, chats with you regarding the spice (or not) level, the available proteins, and perhaps the style of cooking she can offer.  After that, she goes back into the kitchen and customises a dish pour vous!  So it's definitely a unique experience that attracts a certain kind of patron.  Second, either go with good company OR patience.  Do not go super hungry, alone.  Food does take a little longer to prepare.  So be forewarned!  Third, food was SOLID.  We got a Butter Chicken, some kinda Lamb Curry, and Palak Paneer with Garlic Naan & Rice, and ended off with Chai.  Butter Chicken stood out and was really good, a bit sweet, with a kick to it.  (I think Ancila said it was only a 2-3 in spicy level.)  Lamb Curry was good too, with a thinner gravy, Palak Paneer was thick, galicky.  Garlic Naan was really good.  Nothing was too overly sweet, salty, creamy, or oil laden.  I usually expect Indian food to bit too salty &/or oily, so that was a nice surprise!  Bill will be a \"surprise\" too, but Ancila emphasised that it's a \"good surprise\".  Everything that I ordered came out to approx. $52, including tax/excluding tips.  So it's not terribly expensive in comparison to other Indian restaurants.  Plus, there were leftovers, so...  Ancila is down-to-earth, welcoming, and really makes it feel as though you're a part of the food making process.  So if you're feeling like something that's unexpected and taking just a small food \"risk\"...or should I say \"adventure\", check this place out!"}
{"text":"We came here a few times already. The food was really fresh and Ancilla's the type of proprietor that makes this place feel like you're having a meal at a friend's home. The Chicken Tikka Masala is something you don't want to miss.  The biagan is pretty amazing too.   Its the first restaurant I've ever been to that I want to ask the chef to bring us what she feels like cooking!  Try to call ahead before you go with your order. It definitely takes some time to get served after you order, but either way the food is definitely worth your time at the restaurant."}
{"text":"Love Indian Food!!! This is a really great place. The people are friendly and the food is fresh. Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Easily the best Indian food I've ever tasted!  To taste her Chana Marsalla or Saag Paneer compared to most places you would think it is a different dish. Bright, simple and balanced flavors."}
{"text":"Get ready to have a perfect Indian meal custom designed to your taste that will spoil you for all others. As others mentioned: no menu, instead a conversation with the owner to discover what you're interested in eating, she will make suggestions and you'll order based on the conversation. (You can also tell her if there is a particular dish you're craving of course). The conversation approach is especially useful if you're an Indian food newbie but is also just a really nice way to order for all. If you really can't handle the lack of menu, read the takeout menu online first, decide what you want & order it, or better yet just get over it & live a little!   The food is perfect, fresh, rich flavors & made to order. Get over here!"}
{"text":"Adorable hakkah chinese, i had an amazing teryaki steak, the service is good ... The soup was very hot and savory, added some hot sauce in it :)!  The restaurant in itself is very spacious, and i found it very very clean ! What i admired the most was the prayer ' it allows visitors to go pray while waiting for the food ! I definately recommend and suggest anyone in the area to go and visit it"}
{"text":"AMAZING! The food was so delicious and the service was great! I can't wait to come back.  Just as an FYI even a 3 rating is still hot so be vary. But regardless the food is so great!"}
{"text":"It was a wonderful dinning experience.  We have always wanted to try this place out and it was better than we expected.  We were greeted by the owner. She explained how the process works. Based on our answers she recommended she dishes. If you are indecisive this is the place to be.  Anyway. We ended up getting curry shrimp and yellow lentil with 2 butter naans. It came down to just over 30 dollars.  * Tip be prepared to wait. She pretty much does the greeting the ordering the cooking and the bill. Go with good company!"}
{"text":"Omg all I can say is AMAZING! !! I had butter chicken it was perfection, the blend of spices and sweetness was great!  The naan bread was homemade fresh to order as was other items ordered. I also ordered samosas they were good nothing special though and lastly I got channa masala with no green chilli and my mouth was watering.  Customer service is impeccable as well."}
{"text":"Food is good but  dont like the idea  of not having menu and waiting for chef to take order and make food is too long to wait.  Whole idea doesnt work. Good for takeout. Dining experience is not good."}
{"text":"No menus! Whoa! Owner cooks & serves. Hmmmm. Ancila's is a different experience altogether. There are no dine in menus, chef comes out and talks to you about your likes and then serves food the way you like it.  All our encounters with the wonderful food being served, be it dine-in, takeout or catering have been truly satisfying.  We love her Saag Paneer, Dal Makhani, Goat Biryani and Chicken Karahi. Naan's are made to order just like everything else.  And, call ahead since it may take her a while since she seems to be running this magnificent operation all by herself!"}
{"text":"The positive reviews are spot on. This place was empty when attended to pick up my take out, but the aroma from the kitchen was awesome. The owner (Ancila) is such a nice lady and she was finishing up my order when I arrived. My order was Mutton Biryani, Butter Chicken, 2 garlic and 3 plan naan's. The total was just under $40.00. When I got home and looked and the portion sizes, I thought I did not order enough food. I was surprised how rich and filling the food was. I can tell you that everything is made fresh and per order. I usually go to Nirvana for my food, but this will be my new favourite spot. Ancila's is very authentic Bombay style cooking."}
{"text":"Absolutely delicious food. Indian food is too spicy for me but no regrets the flavour was great. Service was accommodating and the hostess was very nice to me and my friends."}
{"text":"1) After reading these steps, immediately go see Ancila. 2) Eat here, often. 3) Repeat.  We decided to try Ancila's based on the 5-star reviews from 4 people. That isn't exactly a ringing endorsement but it seemed the best option.  We parked out front on a frigid, blustery Tuesday evening and joked there was not a soul in the place except for the warm, friendly woman behind the register. I asked if we needed reservations and we laughed for a minute before picking out table.   There were no menus, no place settings, and the place was sparsely decorated, no frills. The woman behind the register approached to ask how spicy we liked our food, from 1-10.   She explained 7-8 was fairly spicy for Indian and that 9-10 is almost too hot to taste the food through. We both settled on 8.  Next, she asked what styles we liked. My friend mentioned vindaloo; phaal was the first thing in my head. Our host informed us she would create a couple of dishes and solicited protein choices. Chicken for me, goat for my friend.  After walking into the kitchen and not reappearing for a few minutes, we discovered she was also cooking our food. We had a couple of beers and some papadum and in 15-20 minutes, our food was done.  It was phenomenal! The goat dish was a coconut-based dish from Southern India and the chicken was in a fiery tomato base. Our host/waitress/chef quipped the goat dish was Muslim while the chicken was Christian and we laughed about negotiating peace through food.  Our multi-talented host was Ancila, owner and namesake. My friend asked if she recently opened, hence the lack of customers.   Ancila replied she prefers word-of-mouth advertising and desires to keep the dining experience personal and unique. It is.   If you're still reading, stop. Go there. You won't regret it. Oh, one tip from Ancila: call ahead and talk to her about your spice preferences, the sauce preparation takes a while and if she can get started before you arrive, you won't wait as long for your food."}
{"text":"It's my first time in Mississauga, ON and my cousin happened to be visiting his Indian girlfriend who lives in Toronto from NYC. We get together for lunch and we come across this restaurant on Yelp. We arrived at around 3pm, past lunch time, and there was only one person dinning, wrapping up at that point. Even though the door was open the restaurant looked like its closing for the afternoon or something. Seconds after, the owner/cook comes out of the kitchen to greet us and she had the most welcoming smile on her face. We asked her if she was open for lunch and her response was, you look hungry and you need to be fed so of course we are serving lunch. Sitting down, the very first question the owner/cook asked us was, on a scale of 1 to 10 how spicy do you like your food to be? After a discussion among ourselves we have decided to go with level 8, 7, 6 and 5 that way we can try different levels. The food was AMAZING and to die for. I have had Indian food in many places including India before but this was exceptional. I highly recommend this place if you would like to experience and authentic Indian, specifically Bombay/Mumbai food. Lamb Biryani and Butter Chicken with Garlic Naan are my personal favorite. Go try this place you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Amazing experience.  The owner is absolutely amazing. She should really be showcased on a cooking show somewhere. ...the food is made fresh while you wait...but she literally makes it just for you. We will go back time and time again..so refreshing nice change from all they typical Pakistani and Indian restaurants. ...this place is Def 5 star!!! We had chatta put curry chicken..shrimp curry w coconut milk...potato dry curry and butter chicken..naan are best we have ever had!!!"}
{"text":"yes 5 pandas everyone love a panda! And 5 pandas are better than 5 stars!   WOW! The food is amazing, everything is made on the spot. Service was fast and family friendly.   We called in advance to make sure they were open, and the lovely lady that runs the place asked us our spice level and what kind of dishes we liked. We asked for butter chicken, saag paneer, and she recommended a shrimp dish on top of rice and butter naan.  We got there by 5:30 pm and it was empty, but there were lots of people picking up takeout. Radio was playing and it's a casual spot that's not too formal.  This is by far the best restaurant Indian food we've had! Call in advance to give her prep time."}
{"text":"Best Indian food I have ever eaten, and I have tried a lot of Indian restaurants. Please go in with the expectation that you will have to wait at least 1 hour if you are dining in. As other reviewers suggested, you can call ahead if you aren't able to wait. She truly customizes the dishes to your taste, and the result is absolutely amazing! She obviously loves what she does and is such a joyful, wonderful person! The prices are also lower than you would expect, comparing it to the average Indian restaurant. You wont be disappointed!"}
{"text":"Not only is the food very good but the lady doing everything is so nice ...what a treat. I asked for chicken tikka masala ,  a little rice and a garlic nan. You can tell that this lady cares ... Everything as very taste .. Well spiced and very flavorful ... Can't Wait to go back"}
{"text":"Ancila's is truly a hidden gem. Eating here is like having a personal chef making you some of the best Indian food. Please note though that if you don't make a reservation you will end up waiting. This is because the food is cooked fresh.  Ancila came out and talked with us for a few minutes to get a feeling of our likes and dislikes and then proceeded to cook up a spectacular dinner.  We didn't have a reservation but no one minded the wait. The food is definitely worth it!"}
