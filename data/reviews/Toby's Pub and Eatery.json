{"text":"Big portions, great quality, nice variety, good service, and surprisingly good for a pub. Really can't go wrong."}
{"text":"I used to go here all the time for cheap drinks, and one time I made the mistake of ordering food. It does say \"Eatery\" in the title, so you would think the food wouldn't be the worst, but you would be wrong. French Onion Soup that was so salty it was inedible, and my friend ordered a club sandwich that seemed to be made with wonder bread. Why even offer food that you don't know how to make?"}
{"text":"I came here for a friends going away party and I have never been so disappointed with a restaurant before. I walked in and the music was so loud I had to scream so my boyfriend could hear when he was standing right beside me. We sat at our table and after ten minutes without a server even walking by, I went to the bar to get our drinks. I had to wait another five minutes for the bartender to stop talking to her friend and take my order.  After all the screaming back and forth I decided to order some food. When I asked for a menu the server rolled her eyes and walked away. when she came back she gave the menu to the girl two seats down from me (I can guarantee we look nothing alike) The food itself was mediocre and bland, and once again delivered to the wrong girl. The rest of the night was filled with more screaming over the music, and waving our arms in the air hoping the server would take her eyes off her cell phone to see if we needed anything. When she finally did the service was nothing but rolled eyes and never paying attention to who they were talking to. The only saving grace for this place was that the drinks are cheap, too bad the service was so bad I couldn't get enough drinks enough to forget this awful experience."}
{"text":"Going to this place seems to always be followed with a \"Never again am I drinking that much again.\" And yet I return, and get just that drunk not that far into the future. It is what it is, and there are definitely better options. That said though, there are worse places, and it has its charms (though I feel that \"charm\" is not the right word)."}
{"text":"I've been coming to Toby's for years and yeah the establishment isn't the nicest, especially the back area but I still love it.  The wings are in my top 5 of Toronto and an added bonus is that they come with fries.  People rant and rave about Duff's, St Louis but the wings at Toby's are better in my opinion.  They're a good size (not super steriod looking) and they're nice and saucy.  The servers are nice and they can take a joke.   On cheap pitcher night there is nothing to complain about except for the occasional loud and obnoxious group which happens in most bars/restaurants.   The other food on the menu is pretty average.  I've had the nachos and a burger but the jewel of this place is the cheap wings and cheap booze.  If you're looking for a low key fun night then I'd highly recommend Toby's."}
{"text":"Came on Sunday and was filled with angry crutch wielding irishmen and servers that swore when we asked a question regarding their flat beer. The wings were okay though."}
{"text":"Drinks are cheap, food is pretty good.  Washrooms are meh.  Service is different depending on the server. I've had awful service by this one girl who kept sitting with the Karaoke host... Never again will I sit in her section.  If you want good service, sit in Katie's section. She's friendly, efficient and overall a pleasure.  Karaoke Sundays & Mondays!!"}
{"text":"A great place to grab a cheap bite and nice cold drinks. They offer mini pitchers for 10 bucks which you can get it as mixed drinks which is hard to find. It's a nice option from a pitcher of beer. The atmosphere is relaxed and you can always meet new people. Their is a long table in the center which I find is the best seat in the house"}
{"text":"Loved this place for three things - cheap beer, cheap wings and the most random crowd.  Always had a good night, half price wings like 5 nights and always a $10 pitcher of something. Totally random as to whether it was busy or not and to be honest it's not in the best shape (holes in the walls etc), but really that just adds to the charm.  Hungry, want some beers and watch some sports? This is the place!"}
{"text":"So a friend and I decide to go to a karaoke bar, spontaneously, and we Google what's around our place. We found a list of the \"best karaoke bars in town\" and this place was recomemded by the blogger, saying it was much better than sneeky dees,that the sound is better and the crowd is better and we decided to go check it out. We get to the bar, order drinks, and ask the karaoke dude how do we sign up, so they only have ONE song book for the whole bar to pick from, so I went on a hunt for it, after a few tables I found it and the guys on the table didn't mind me taking it, they were done with it, so as soon as I pick it up and making my way back to our table, this waitress, kinda medium build brunette, with a ton of attitude and a dash of rudeness asks me for the book, not even nicely, she just said \" hey I need that\", surprised by her tone I just said \"umm...no??\" To which she asked,with even more attitude and a grin on her face like I was insane to say no to her , she said \"why??\" Lol and I told her I just walked from my table to the whole bar to find it and I want to pick a song, she rolled her eyes and just left lol. So I went to my table, picked the song and as soon as I passed to my friend for him to pick miss rude waitress came back, and just as rude as the first time she asks again, and this time I point out how rude she is and ask to talk to a manager, another girl comes and offers to handle it...she didn't even talk to her after talking to us lol. So we wait for our turn to sing, mind you no one picked a song while we were picking from the ONLY song book in the bar,and there wasn't many people when we got in. Later we notice that even people who came way after us were called to sing,twice...3times lol after like the 20th song we left. You make your judgment yourself if you want to go to this place, I only shared MY experience.  Thank you."}
{"text":"The food is not great- bar food and not at its best  The drinks are cheap- I especially like the cheap mixed drink pitchers, you can get whisky sours, long island iced teas etc  Service is not fast or accurate- but order enough drinks in good company and it won't matter!"}
{"text":"Happy Birthday to me!!  Perhaps you might say that I am not qualify to give this place four stars seeing that I have never seen the menu, nor am I a Toronto native.   But cmon guys! 10$ mini-pitchers- no need for presents, just lots of vodka sours."}
{"text":"I came here with a big group a few weeks ago and I really like the service I got. It sucks when the waitress only takes my orders for food and beer, but when I ask for glasses of water they almost never came. I first got a pint, and hamburger with fries, then another pint, and then a pitcher. I asked for water like 5 times in between and water came once at the beginning and another time after. No good. Also, I thought mayo automatically comes with the hamburger. I thought they had forgotten about it so I asked for it...then I see $1 charge for \"extra mayo\" on my bill. There was no mayo to begin with so how it is extra? Again, no good. Lastly, I wish the waitress told me about a pitcher special at the beginning. I could have saved some money. My error for not knowing. The waitress not giving me water was the worst thing."}
{"text":"Toby's to me and many others is an institution of cheap beer, an oddly eclectic crowd, an oddly eclectic menu, and fantastic wings. These wings are half priced every night of the week except for Friday and Saturday (or perhaps they are just double priced on those nights), but basically you can get a pound and fries for $5. Or two pounds and fries for $10. And they're very good. And they come with a carrot stick. So how about that. Vegetables and meat...together. For $5."}
{"text":"Came here a few times for my favorite karaoke guy Jason Rolland who does karaoke there on Sundays and Mondays. Not as intimate of a setting as I like in general for karaoke but its a great time.  When I was there on a Monday they were serving up $10 pitchers of Canadian among a bunch of other brands but to be honest my Canadian tasted 'off' - I am unsure how to describe it other than that. Maybe they need to clean their pipes of their bar? Again, I don't know. The Jalapeno Poppers with creamy dip for $6.99 my friend got were delicious!  I got as a main the Butter Chicken for 12.99 at the recommendation of Jason Rolland and it was really really good. Nice and spicy, came with two types of bread, lots of sauce a big thing of rice. Very filling."}
{"text":"If you come to Toby's with the right people, perhaps their company will help you enjoy your experience.  The beer is cheap.  The food is terrible.  The place is dirtier than dirty.  The music is just barely tolerable.  If you want to catch the game, it might be on.  Service is hard to find.  Even when you want to pay them, it's a struggle.  Toby's is convenient for groups as you can put as many people as you want at the long center table.  The booths are a little more restrictive for numbers, but a little cozier.  This is actually a one-star establishment, but I've had some good times here so I felt oliged to kick it up a notch.  What exactly is this place famous for?  Certainly not their eats."}
{"text":"The elder and - as is often the case - superior brother to Dog's Bollocks, we attended the opening back in 2009 when there were no ceiling tiles and to play music you could just take a CD from a big cardboard box and play it in a discman hooked up to the stereo system. While there have been many improvements - it's hard to find a better place to watch the game - that super accessible and indifferent attitude keeps Toby's on my list of great joints.  Incredibly cheap pitchers and you MUST try the suicide hot wings and butter chicken. Both amongst best in town."}
{"text":"Bar classique à la canadienne c'est la clientèle et le style musical qui se démarque ici : j'entends par là hip hop et RNB US pur jus! Moi qui adore ce style je n'ai pas été déçu, en effet à Paris les seuls endroits où on peut entendre ce son c'est en boîte de nuit et rarement dans les bars. A part ça le service est sympa et les consos correct. Ne soyez pas intimidés par les mecs au look gangsta rap bougeant sur le dancefloor, ils sont super cools, vous prendront en photo si vous leur demandez poliment et n'embêteront jamais les meufs."}
{"text":"I have no clue what people are thinking this place gets 2/5. It isn't some fancy bar or a high-end pub - it's cheap as hell, and a great place to watch sports. The food is just decent pub food. If you are going to exotic food at a cheap bar like Toby's, the problem is you."}
{"text":"Its a student bar, with student drinks and student eats... Maybe I'm just getting old. Came here two weeks ago for a bar blitz on the long weekend with two old buddies from the area. My friend D, not known for his classy tastes, and I decided on Toby's, a place we had been kicked out of often in our youth.  We sat at the back and the poor waitress was actually quite good, considering how busy it was on a Sunday. She promptly arrived with our pints of mixed drinks (yikes) and our specials. The pints of mixed drinks were almost undrinkable (not that stiff, just poorly mixed) and the burger I ate, Had at one point resembled meat, but not anymore...   Highlight of the evening was an old-timer rocking  out to Ramstein... definetly  beat outs the tweens who sang House of the Rising Sun."}
{"text":"We went for the Leafs season opener and it was packed to the gills. The food itself was just OK. Not bad, not amazing. I'd say it was a decent value because the prices were pretty good. The atmosphere was what you'd expect from a sports-oriented pub. Lots of big TVs and even a projection screen (which we were lucky enough to sit in front of) so getting that sports action was easy and fun.   I was impressed with how well our server manged to keep tabs on us given how busy the place was.  Anyhow, I would go back with friends for another sporting event, but I am not sure I'd go for other reasons."}
{"text":"Cheap beer and chicken wings. Too bad about the service.  We've been here quite a few times now and usually the service is good enough. One of the waitresses, Sevda, was incredibly rude, enough to warrant this review.  We were sitting on the patio with our dog tied up outside the fence/gate. We were enjoying our meal and drinks, but as soon as Sevda started her shift, she came over and accused us of letting our dog, tied up outside the premises, take a poop on their property almost a month ago. She yelled at us in front of the entire restaurant, accusing us of intentionally letting him poop and purposely covering it up with a piece of tissue. She said she remembered us and saw a video of him doing it, and that she was barring us from being there.  Our waitress (the one who was serving us prior to Ice Queen's rowdy arrival) was totally sympathetic and apologetic, and confirmed that we were not kicked out or barred.  After talking with Sevda with a manager present, it turns out she didn't actually see the video. She saw dog poop there an HOUR after we left. Come on.  They've promised to try and show me the video if it exists. I've given them the date and time we were there last month to help them find it.  Now, if our dog pooed, and we didn't notice either during or after, I will apologize to them and delete this review. I seriously doubt it though- I am sure we would have seen it and picked it up right away, or at least we would have seen it when we left. Until I see the video, I think they owe me an apology. Seriously, there are tens of dogs walking by every hour. In any case her approach to us was totally brash and uncalled for.  The way Sevda handled the situation today was just totally out of line. Even the table next to us was totally turned off, and said they'd avoid coming back on Sevda's shift, lest they be randomly yelled at, and on grounds that are totally circumstantial at best."}
{"text":"Toby's, where no one knows your name. It's the kind of place where you jump in, grab a pitcher (or 2, or 3) and jump out to another \"cooler\" bar.   That's what I do. With $10 pitchers, one being Flying Monkey's Hoptical Illusion, you can't beat the price. It's a good starting point for a great night. Staying is an option, but it's full of mixed randoms. Some older, some creepy, some balding, most younger. It's eclectic and casual but it's also dingy. The vibe isn't exactly rowdy, it's just semi-loud. Service is not that great, they take their sweet time between pitchers and take three times as long to bring your bill.  Overall, it's the fuel that get's your motors runnin'. For anything else, you should check-in to another rodeo."}
{"text":"I need everyone to know that not even the pitchers are worth it. Just waited a full hour to get service and went up to the bar many times to serve ourselves. I know that toronto bars don't have the best service but this is crazy."}
{"text":"This is my second time coming to Toby's and I'm usually not a fan of food from dive bars but I was pleasantly surprised when I came here. The food part of this review is only on the South East Asian food of their menu. The most recent time, we came with a few friends after softball practice.  FOOD: Both times I came here I ordered something from the south east Asian section of their menu. The latest time I got Chicken Tikka Masala and I asked the waitress to make it extra spicy for me. It came with ample amounts of rice, naan and papadum (large crispy chip like naan). It was delicious and the perfect amount of spicy for me. My friends got their half priced wings since it was a Monday and they enjoyed it.  DRINKS: We shared some pitchers of cheap domestic beer. It was cheap domestic beer, nothing else needs to be said here.  SERVICE: The server was great and very attentive. When I asked for my food super spicy she said she wasn't sure if that's possible but she will try and she definitely delivered.   Not the best pub in the world but decent enough for their south east Asian food and cheap beer. Would recommend if you're looking for a decent dive bar."}
{"text":"Can't say anything about the food because I didn't try anything. We came to watch a soccer game and the waitress was very nice and put it on for us. Service was great, she kept checking on us regularly. The place isn't fancy at all but if you're here to watch sports, this place is a good choice."}
{"text":"This review is really only pertaining to wings on wings night, which is on Thursdays and wings are half price. The wings themselves are large, meaty, and hella crispy. House sauce and hot and honey are my favs but they've for a great array! The only constructive feedback is their hot isn't going to burn your face off, but hey, you want your food to be edible!   The sweet potato fries are super delicious. I upgrade the fries that come with my wings!   The service is always friendly, even when it's a little slow on busy nights. It usually depends on if there are big sports games on."}
{"text":"I went to Toby's Famous Eatery on a friday around 6pm or so.  It was not too busy at the time.  They had an English food special going on that day so me and my gf ordered the Steak and Caesar Salad Special which was only $7.99 along with a pitcher of Steamwhistle which was only $10.  I have no complaints regarding the food that we got for the amount that we paid.  Overall, I'd recommend this place to anyone looking for cheap food and drinks.  The quality of the food isn't going to be 5 star restaurant-like, but you get what you pay for.  P.S.  They also have specials on Monday (Indian) and Wednesday (Italian) in addition to the english special on friday."}
{"text":"Mixed feelings about this place. It's a pretty standard sports bar. Lots of high back chairs and tables, tvs within every sight line, and your typical sports memorabilia and UFC posters lining the walls.  Admittedly I was coerced to come here for the promise of cheap drinks and chicken wings. The chicken wings were pretty good and they were on special for half price when I was there (so about $6 for 7 wings with fries and a couple carrots/celery). Medium had a surprising amount of spice, and even the mild had a bit of zest. Wings were pretty tasty and might be the best thing this place has going for it. Beer selection is decent in the sense of your normal big brands but still a couple of decent craft options. I will say that $7.20 per pint of Flying Monkeys and $6.75 for a vodka mixed drink isn't really what I would define as cheap, but it is a pretty standard going rate.  Service is the biggest flop to the night. While our waitress was nice, she was very hard to get the attention of and seemed to like to hang out at talk with the bartender instead of servicing her area, so whenever she came back all the tables in the area would fight for her attention.   I don't know how often (if at all) I will return here, but its not as bad as a lot of the reviews here make the place out to be. Approach with low expectations and you'll probably have a decent time."}
{"text":"Came here after work for an early dinner.  This place was recommended by a friend as I was craving for some chicken wings. The pub is located in quite the interesting area at Bathurst and College. First impression I had on this place was it seemed pretty dingy inside.  The good thing about this place is they have  1/2 price chicken wings when the purchase of a beverage. I was pretty hungry and ordered a coke and 2 lbs of wings in the house and butter chicken sauces. Food came out relatively quickly and was definitely surprised the size of the chicken wings were much larger than I expected.  Wings were good. Loved the house sauce as it added a nice kick to it. The butter chicken sauce tasted great as well. Very generous portions for  1/2 price wings night!  I was little bit disappointed to find out later on that there weren't free refills on the soft drinks.- the waitress told me after getting my 3rddrink. I know it's not good to never assume things but traditionally at many restaurants, there are usually free refills on soft drinks considering you are charging about $3.00/pop.  Overall, a decent restaurant to come get some pub food.  Service was okay. Definitely come by on Tuesday for their wings night. It's cheap and delicious!"}
{"text":"We used to come here every Sunday after hockey with the team.  If it wasn't for our last experience, I would've given this place a 2-3 star rating because the beer is cheap and the half-priced wings on Sunday are well worth it.  After almost a year of coming here every Sunday, the service didn't get any better.  We didn't really care though because we were there for the beer and wings.  If the server was busy, we used to go and pick up our own orders, ketchup, and utensils while she was serving the 1 or 2 other tables there.   Last experience there nothing went right.  The beer was flat, there was a roach under one of the glasses (when we showed the server, she didn't seem surprised), and the server was outright mean to us when we told her about the beer and showed her the roach trapped under a glass.    Used to love Toby's... won't be going back anymore."}
{"text":"I go to tobys on wed for DJ Laws Da what parties straight ol skool hip hop and some RnB, with request taken by LAW, beer is cheep as the $10 pitcher changes one week canadian next week honey brown, oh half price wings on wed so u get 20 wings and fries and veggies and dip for 9.99 get a pitcher $10...Do you understand what I am saying to you.  I took a star off cause twice they had no bbq sauce for the wings LOL.  PS they have a waitress who is black and actually should be modeling you guys so go check her out and tip her well too."}
{"text":"Poorly named, Toby's is neither famous, nor should it be marketing itself as an eatery. Do not come here to eat (but if you do, get the honey hot wings-- theyre really good, and from the sounds of the other reviews not much else here is).  Toby's is the place you come to pre-drink and end up staying the whole night.  Come here for $10 pitchers, karaoke, and a fun, down to earth crowd. For that, I'm a fan."}
{"text":"This isn't a fine dining establishment so don't expect much.  If you're looking for a great place to grab a few beers with your friends and eat some inexpensive food this is a great place.  $10-13 Pitchers of domestic to premium beer.  Half price wings which are quite large considering the price.  They also have some other daily specials but I've only ever had the wings and the nachos."}
{"text":"Prices are not great.... Young staff, often distracted. Overall is ok. Good size with the interior."}
{"text":"Ok place to get drinks, don't know about the food - i cant imagine it would be anything other than your standard pud fair. There isn't much room to stand around unless you're able to snatch up a table on the weekend and lemmi tell you - good luck!   At 9pm on a Saturday night it was already packed. They have mini pitchers of vodka cranberry and rum and cokes and mixed drinks like that which was great - a much better deal than getting drinks separately!   Music was ok, we actually just got prety tipsy and started dancing right next to the bar cuz we DUN CURR. I would come here again if it was a meet up spot and stay a while before going somewhere else to get ma freak onnn"}
{"text":"Worts possible service.  I was there for hours watching UFC.  In that time our waitress managed to forget 4 orders.  Our drinks went dry every round and we had to wait 10 minutes and work pretty hard to get her attention.  It isn't as though they didn't expect the volume with the fight either.  I went in ahead of time to find out how busy it would be and they new that they would be turning people away.  When we did get food it was terrible.  The cheep booze just isn't worth it."}
{"text":"Came here looking for a late night bite with friends. Waited over an hour for our food which is a little ridiculous considering it wasn't too busy in the there for a Friday night and by the looks of it, it was mostly just customers there for drinks. The waitress apologized for the arrival time of the food because there was only one chef working/cooking...   The restaurant inside does not look very presentable (needs better decor and nicer seating).   The food was not worth the wait. $12.99 for bland three cheese mac n cheese, the onions inside the mac n cheese was brown and mushy. Oddly my boyfriend enjoyed the mac n cheese, I did not. You could also taste something powdery in the dish. Might as well have made Kraft Dinner at home.   Our waitress was very nice but was not consistent on checking up on how we're doing or if we needed anything. Waited forever to pay the bill.   The only thing that might have looked fun was the pool table. I think this place would be okay for a few friends to relax, watch a sports game and have a beer/drink."}
{"text":"For good food and cheap drinks this is decent, and conveniently located: the owner also owns The Dog's Ballocks on Queen street.  The difference I think between the two is that this one is a bit quieter than Dog's and somewhat smaller.   The food is yummy here  too - about average in price-  but well proportioned.   During the summer it's always crammed with drunks watching sports on TV screens that seem to be everywhere in the bar. It IS a bit warm inside because of all the people but they try to keep you cool with cheap beer and opening every window they possibly could.  If you're looking for a good dive, this is it."}
{"text":"So my partner and I come to this place every time we want wings. 1) they're so cheap; 2) the portions are huge and so far the only place that serves wings with fries; 3) the best damn wings I've had in Toronto. (PLEASE tell me there are better ones out there somewhere)  We love coming and will continue.  My only complaint is the service isn't great. The waitresses tend to be chatty by the bar or with other patrons. While they're all very nice and some go the extra mile to make us laugh, they could be a little more attentive to the tables they're serving.   Other than that, 100% would recommend."}
{"text":"Food: 2/5 Service: 3/5 Location: 2/5  Came here for half price wings and a beer during a game and my first impression was the weird odour that was emanating from the kitchen - not a great start. The hot and honey wings were pretty good and my friend got some great sweet potato fries. Our server was nice, but overall the experience was pretty mediocre. I probably wouldn't come back."}
{"text":"I used to love Toby's for the cheap booze (even though it tasted a little watered down). However the service is just too poor. The last time I was there, I saw my server eat one of my fries as she carried the plate over to me!!!"}
{"text":"Dined at Toby's after a long day of work because it was convenient for us.  My colleagues and I each ordered a pint of beer.  They have a good selection of beers on tap and are roughly $6-$7 each.  We also ordered the Mighty Toby's Combo Platter (chicken wings, calamari, chicken fingers,  potato skins, garlic bread, pub fries, and onion  rings).  It was a good combination consisting of different variety for us to enjoy.  The chicken strips was a bit hard.  Not a big fan of their garlic bread or onion rings.  I mostly enjoyed the calamari, wings potato skin and fries."}
{"text":"Damn (re: the ratings on this place, but also relevant as the DJ was playing Kendrick's new album while I was here).  My friend and I wandered in here because Sneaky Dee's was full, tbh. I don't drink anymore but they had a fair amount of beers on tap. I noticed that they had Indian food on the menu, which was weird? Is that a British pub thing now? Like... Britain, you know Indian food ain't yours, right? Calm your colonial urges. Anyway, my Indian self wasn't about to order Indian food from this honkey joint. But I digress....  I ordered bruschetta and yam fries, and they were both delicious. The yam fries came with this creamy, spicy dip that was magic for my taste buds.  Our server was fun and friendly, and the atmosphere of the place was fun and laid back. Ya done good, Toby's!"}
{"text":"They have half-off wings.  It's like that Christmas store - you know that year-round Christmas store that sells half-off merchandise for 11 months out of the year?  It's like that but for 12 months out of the year and it's for chicken wings."}
{"text":"Key Feature: Flying Monkey: Hoptical Illusion pitchers - 10.99  The thing about Toby's is that you need to feel the place, to really enjoy it.  From the outside, there's not much to it.  It's a little bit too loud, and it's a little bit too dark.  Twice a week there are university students who pretend to enjoy karaoke while looking to find bond-pairs.    But, at the heart of it, you'll find that Toby's can be a charming joint to grab a pint or seven, and just hang out, in the ever darkening, bar.  About once an hour the lights dim another 5%.  There are, of course, times when the lights hit about 50% efficiency, but I've always assumed that was to create 'sexy times' that only soft light can provide.  Sunday - Thursday the wings are half price.  They're the only real food worth buying.  Once upon a time I had a quesadilla, and the cheese they used was a Kraft single.   At the end of the day, it's the beer that drives you in.  With over six types of beer (Including Flying Monkey, Hoptical Illusion) for 10.99 it's a place to pound back the pints without destroying your wallet.  That, and the bathroom tiles that get kicked away, one by one, make Toby's a place you'll either love - or hate.  For me, though?  There's no better place to grab a pint, than by the open window looking out onto College, at 1pm on a summers day.  And the booths at the back; that's where I spend my winter evenings."}
{"text":"Food was mediocre. Chicken dry fries flavour less really would not reccomend for more than beer and wings. Service was ok"}
{"text":"Toby's started off by underwhelming me and then things went downhill.  A few friends and I went there for pitchers and breakfast (don't judge me, lol) and my first impression was meh.  A standard sports type bar with standard pub fare and breakfast.  Before i get into the reasons for the 1 star rating i have to say that our waitress was fantastic.  She was friendly and attentive (I guess that's easy when we were the only ones there).   First strike was that they had lost their breakfast menus.  Luckily the waitress could remember what they had so that was good.  The beer menu was good as well and cheap, no problems on that front.   The food was average but reasonably priced, however they muddled details of the order (no big deal, but still not great).  All of the above should generate a 2 or 3 star review but we are coming to the big issue, the cleanliness (or lack thereof) of the men's washroom.  There was paper towel all over the floor and one of the urinals was full of puke from the night before, that's really gross.  Now I know that cleaning up drunk peoples puke sucks, but you have a bar frequented by college kids, this will happen, you should at least clean it up before opening the next day."}
{"text":"We came here in a group of 4 on a Saturday night around 7:30. Place wasn't pack and a group of servers were just talking to each other ignoring us. One was on her cell phone and the rest I assumed just gossiping. Dont get me wrong, beer is really cheap here. $12 for a pitcher. Thats the only good thing about it."}
{"text":"Had the Nachos last night with chilli - it was absolutely delicious."}
{"text":"it was my first time in toronto and was visiting a bunch of friends who lived here.  came with a group of 7 girls for someone's birthday party, and urgh WORST bouncer experience ever!  and i live in manhattan and bouncers there are pretty ridiculous  Toby's bouncer refused to accept my US driver's license, even though I had multiple back up IDs with my name and everything (and I am legal to drink in the US and therefore obviously Canada).  He said for foreigners he'd only accept passports.  Since we were here for a party, we couldn't just go elsewhere so I had to take taxi back to my friend's place to get my passport.  The bar seemed fine but that just killed my mood for the rest of the night  ironically, we had two underage girls with us using other people's ids, including a British girl who was using a canadian id that looked nothing like her and obviously spoke with a foreign accent... both got in no problem. haaaaaaa redic. lesson learned... lying is always better"}
{"text":"I love this place.  I come here and to the labyrinth lounge on bloor for my cheap drinks.  This one more so for $10 pitchers of beer, and food I can actually ingest (and n joy!)"}
{"text":"Only go to Toby's if you are looking for delicious food, inexpensive beer and great company. Basically, Toby's is the standard by which all other bar-eateries in the city should be held up against.   If you go to a bar like Toby's and order anything that strays too far from wings, fries, nachos or a burger, well you get what you deserve. It's a bar, so stick to the basics people. That being said, the fries are outstanding. I have had fries from all over the world, but none are as good as the ones they serve up at Toby's (though Swiss Chalet is a close second). And the wings are equally impressive. I would suggest a mix of hot and honey-garlic. I have no idea why anyone would go to Duff's just down the street. Toby's wings are twice as tasty and about 1/3 the price. So obviously it's way better. I don't think I've had better wings in the city to be honest... there are some spots out in Oshawa that may have Toby's wings beat on taste, but nobody offers better value. And I'm all about value.   The waitresses are super cute and provide just the right amount of friendly/flirty banter. Sometimes they remember my name, which is a great touch.   Everybody used to complain about the bathrooms because they were covered in graffiti, smelled like dirty mop water and there were no mirrors. I never thought this was really such a bad thing. At Toby's, you don't need to keep running to the bathroom... to check your hair and makeup... you can just come as you are. But I'm happy to report that they have renovated the bathrooms and they are beautiful. Lots of mirrors and no dirty mop smell. In fact, there is a lovely cK one cologne smell since they added a bathroom attendant. He sells bubble gum and squirts of cologne and will also turn on the taps for you. A very nice touch. It kinda reminds me of a strip club, but that's not such a bad thing. I just hope Toby's isn't going too fancy on us... they have also added faux alligator skin benches which look and feel very real.  Toby's is pretty much the opposite of almost every other bar-eatery in the city. It's unpretentious, inexpensive, friendly, tasty and brings together a wonderful mix of people. And you'll often get to see a pretty good fight. It's everything a great bar should be."}
{"text":"For the record. I think Toby's is the worst. The pits, Bush-league, crummy, miserly, kids day at the Ex. If you have any standards, this place is going piss you off and it takes all my will power to not run screaming from this bar whenever I happen to visit it.  I subjected myself to Toby's for so long due to it being my boyfriends 'home-bar'. It's a 2 minute walk from his apartment, he has a soft spot for the owner Moe, AND we're big leaf fans, so we had A LOT of game dates here.  The Good: This place gets a star for the servers, 99% of them are really cool chicks that have a great sense of humour.  Another star goes to their wings. Which are basically the ONLY thing they do right here. They do the classic sauce style in mild medium or hot and golly are their wings saliva inducing; the right amount of crispy and saucy. Saturday you get them for half price so that's always a treat for Hockey Night in Canada :D  The Bad: The rest of their food is pretty scary and VOM inducing. I had their git fit burger (no bun) and the patty was practically a charcoal. It was also TOTALLY flavourless and unseasoned. Suck city. I also had their butter chicken a couple times and although it wasn't totally terrible, every single time I had it, they left a HUGE dollop of unmixed curry paste at the bottom of the bowl which just ruined the meal. MIX YO DAMN PASTE.  The Worst: Some people think their cheap beer and $10 pitchers are in the plus category, but if you actually enjoy the taste of beer...don't buy the drafts, stick with the bottles. I think the secret to their cheap beer on tap is that almost all of it is SWILL. No matter if you order Canadian, Pabst, or the higher end stuff like Sapporo it all practically tastes the same with very subtle differences. If you're a experienced beer drinker, you can tell that every beer has unique characteristics and flavor profiles. NOT AT TOBY'S YA'LL - they probably throw it into a large vat all together at the end of the day and sell it the next day as both domestic and premium draft. The only thing I know that they don't mix is the Labatt 50 because it still tastes like suicide. I KNOW YOUR SECRET TOBY'S AND I'M TELLING EVERYONE.  Fun fact! My very sweet and down to earth boyfriend once got bottled here while trying to diffuse a fight situation. Some tweaked out college kid thought it would be best to show off to his buddies in the most absurd way possible. Their group ended up getting kicked out, and Moe offered free beer to my boyfriend hoping he wouldn't sue.  In conclusion; Toby's, visit at your own risk."}
{"text":"Great Karaoke, cheap beer, average food.  Toby's on College is a large bar, with long tables at the back that are ideal for big gatherings.  They also have many big screen TV's throughout the bar to catch the game or a wrestling or MMA event.  Sunday and Monday nights are by far the best nights to hit this place up as they serve up the best karaoke DJ in the city Jason Rolland from 10pm til close each night.  Jason is a great karaoke DJ that offers up several laughs with his commentary in between songs... however the narrow set-up of Toby's and the karaoke set-up in the middle of the bar can sometimes make it hard to see who's singing.  If you're a beer lover, the bar offers up a good selection on tap, plus 3 or 4 drafts that are priced at the amazingly cheap $10 a pitcher!  The food is very average though.  DO NOT get the nachos, they use bruschetta mix of tomatoes and onions on them which is an awful combination.  The fries leave a lot to be desired, but the burgers are a good staple to go with here... they offer up a decent selection of different types of burgers, and they're all pretty good both in taste and portion size."}
{"text":"I am very disappointed with the service we got from Toby's famous eatery.   1) I reserved the back area of the place a week in advance and once I got there, they gave the seats away to someone else.  2) the service was horrible. Our waitress took forever to serve us and spilled drinks on us as well  3) when we left, they gave us the bill and it was ridiculously over priced. The waitress charged us on stuff we didn't order (eg. Nachos, extra shots, extra pitcher of beers)   Overall. It was a horrible experience and I seriously do hope this restaurant reads this review so that they can change the way they serve there customers. The only thing that was \"alright\" about the place was the music. The Dj was fantastic."}
{"text":"Had wings and a pint of beer, total came to $15.85 gave $40 and my server decided to tip herself by keeping my change. Wasn't very impressed by that, then when I asked for my change she told me only gave her a 20 bill. Long story short, some.battles are not worth fighting. And yeah Dont hire squeegee girls as servers. Good price for food and drinks but the sad service really drags this place down and into the mud"}
{"text":"Not sure what everyone's major moan about this place is. Hey, it's not great, but I fail to see what is wrong with it. It's a shitty sports pub, what do you expect?  I've been here a few times to watch UFC on Saturday nights (no cover charge, but if you arrive past 10pm you likely will not get in).   Sundays/Mondays they do karaoke, which is mostly rock & roll themed(no Celine Dion allowed, most similar crap songs have been removed from the book of song selections) Lots of drunk guys rocking out to GNR and Metallica.   They always have lots of drink specials, including small pitchers of mixed bevvies for $10, booze is equivelant to 3 regular drinks so it's a decent deal. They don't chince on the alcohol either, those bad boys are potent.  The nachos are huge and apparently the wings are good (don't eat wings personally, but my mates speak highly of them)  The wait staff has always been decent. I've sometimes had to flag our server down to get the bill, but that's to be expected when a place is packed.  The bathrooms ARE awful though - on par with Sneaky Dees. Super dingy, doors falling off their hinges, bad graffiti, dim lighting, direly in need of some kind of renovation."}
{"text":"Toby's has called for a quick and somewhat uninspired review! I have visited this location twice with a large group. The fact that it is very spacious and there is an elevated separate space for groups at the back earns Toby its first star. Half decent service and food earn the other star. Fast forwarding through cheap prices and mediocre pitchers, I find myself annoyed the most by the dirtiness of the bar. The last time I visited, a roach calmly climbed down from the wall next to our table before finding its way under the table and keeping the group a little paranoid for the next little while! The restrooms tell another tale I won't get into... Toronto can do better."}
{"text":"There is literally no blessed reason why the rating here is so low.   What Do You Living Idiots Want From a Cheap Bar?   Ok so the wings are mushy and REALLY weird chicken and the hot sauce is just pure tongue incineration but the whiskey is cheap and it's big and dark and the tables are totally capable of having glasses on them. So that basically covers everything I think. The carpeting is dirty but you don't have to touch it if you don't want to.   Bathrooms are Incongruously Nice."}
{"text":"This is the go to place for any TSCC floor hockey evening league for cheap wings and beer.  On a Tuesday you will find yourself amongst other adult sport playing beer league team or simply locals for a cheap pint (can change each week).  Always a special at any given time but Tuesday is $6.99 wings and fries which is pretty cheap.  You can upgrade this to a poutine for an extra $3... service is not the greatest especially when there is a hot sport on like the Leafs, Playoffs or any interesting sport, slow service.    A dive of a sports bar but cozy and comfortable where you need not to get dressed up or what other people things.  Free wifi, sometime.  PW is their phone number.  Do not bother with the salad... just don't.  Stick with wings, burgers and you'll be fine--Sheppard pie isn't the greatest.  If you're feeling brave try the Butter Chicken poutine"}
{"text":"It's five o'clock on a Monday during a partial black out... do you know where your children are? Well if they work at my call centre they was a Toby's having an impromptu after party after and epic work booze cruise.  I hesitated at first to come here based on the reviews but my coworkers were set on a cheap place. Seven large wings, fries and carrot/celery sticks for $4. Mini pitchers with three shots were $10 and shots were $3.Despite the price, me and my 15 coworkers managed to drop a few hundred dollars (during the day time).   This place was cheap but we definitely paid for it with attitude and shitty service.  Our server was horrible. She rolled her eyes at every order and avoided our table like the plague!  At one point a hand talking friend knocked over his drink and she condescendingly asked if everyone could please stay in their seats and settle down... REALLY?! We were definitely loud but not out of hand... drink spilling happens to the best of us sober.  Shortly after our bartender decided to cut us off.... it wasn't even 8pm! We decided to go to Sneeky's instead.   The lesson here is that sometimes you have to read Yelp reviews and voice them to your friends before going to a random bar!"}
{"text":"I'd like to preface this review by saying I love classless joints. The cheaper the beer, the stronger the star power. I like when servers aren't too nice and when the clientele is down to earth and eclectic. But Toby's just sucks.  Wait, so why have I been here more often than I can count? Cheap drinks. Convenient location. Sports on TVs. There. Those are the three redeeming factors. And that's why I give this place two stars, not one. But everything else is just so, so lame. I don't even know where to begin.  I'll start with the awkward service. There'a a particular server who -- to put it gently -- is annoying and greedy. She always wants to settle the bill ASAP and before you leave a tip she talks about her financial woes, literally trying to guilt trip you into giving her a big tip. She'll also share lots of personal information that you probably won't give two poops about. I totally understand developing casual friendships with clients but you have to know social cues. You can't just go around spreading your business like Don Juan spreading his seed. Place and time.  Weekends are packed. The karaoke here is great but the clientele is trashy, messy and starved for midnight encounters. I guess it's an ideal playground for 19 year olds, but anyone who possesses intelligence, wit or dignity might be turned off from this place.  You still might find me here on a Thursday night with a pint in hand. Hehehe."}
{"text":"Surviving my previous dining experience here gave me the confidence to go deeper on the menu and order some Real Food. I got a $0.99 burger (with fries and toppings it works out to $5.50) and my date ordered the perogies. Awful. (Her exact words were \"barfaroni\", actually.) I didn't try the perogies, but the audible rap of her fork against their hard exterior was sufficient.  As for the burger, the bun was stale and the meat was thoroughly burnt. Please note that in spite of my rock-bottom expectations AND my pre-order warning by an Elite yelper that happened to be there (thanks Payam Z) I was still offended by the plate -- low, low prices notwithstanding. Never, ever, order food here.  And the real star-loosener? Pitchers are now a dollar more expensive. What a bummer."}
{"text":"Nice vibe; came for a quick pont; PBR $5 and tax. Next door they had a night market so it was nice to chill around the block for a bit. One pool table, lots of space for groups. Bartenders deliberating who to send home despite sizeable Thursday crowd. Picked his place over Sneaky's for the quick pint."}
{"text":"Came here with a group of 9 for the Pacquiao fight, was seated in the back area, there was only one waitress and for this type of establishment I thought the service was gonna be rude, slow, and useless. Boy was I proven wrong. In the 4-5 hours we sat there; the girl remembered every order, was quick to serve, even provided separate bills for everyone, and while she wasn't super friendly, she was not even close to being a b****. Lots of other bars can take note of her service  (unfortunately did not get her name).  4-stars for the service 2-3stars for the nachos (marina sauce instead of salsa?? Gross.)"}
{"text":"In my day, Toby's was a famous eatery with at least 5 popular locations, and Toby the mascot was still alive. Admittedly, my prime barhopping days were a couple of decades back...  Today, Toby the dog is long-dead, and this hollow shell of a location is all that remains of the franchise. Back when, crowds flocked in for the burgers and cheezy fries - and for good reason. They were damn delicious.   Today, they're barely edible.  As some have mentioned, the wings are still edible, but only good value during \"Happy Hour\" at half price. With the cheap pitchers of domestic draft, it's worth considering, if that's what you're after.  Otherwise, don't bother."}
{"text":"Toby's is an institution in my life, and last year I came here with a group of buddies for old time's sake. Though I love it, I've always recognized it as being awful... but you know what? I'm getting soft in my old age. I'm going to update this review to three stars.   Half price chicken wings on week nights, cheap beer (even Bone Shake was $14/48ounce pitcher) and nice service. Is it still a really sterile, strange giant student pub with club music on weekends and horrible karaoke on Mondays? Yes. But it's A OK by me."}
{"text":"What can I say about Tobys ha, I am there quite often. If you want to drink and watch sport its ideal and fits the bill. But if you want to eat or get food just no. Sorry Toby, but again for crowds who want to drink and watch soccer perfect."}
{"text":"Good Mac and cheese  Sub par service Lots of TVs and a great sized bar  Good pricing on beer"}
{"text":"One should go to Toby's just for the booze.  Not for the food (for the most part), not for the atmosphere, not to tag the bathrooms, and not for pool (that table is warped).  Get lubed up with their cheap pitchers and move on elsewhere."}
