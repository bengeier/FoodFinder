{"text":"What a wonderful find! We loved the cozy Czech-inspired atmosphere and decor. Also great service and lovely menu items! So happy to have discovered this little piece of Europe in my own town."}
{"text":"We primarily like to support local chef-owned restaurants but sadly off Tashereau and Dix 30, there's really not much of that to go around. So we were very happy to discover cosy Bohemia. Can't believe it's been around for decades and yet we just found them.  The food was decent but the atmosphere and service were really lovely."}
{"text":"Belle découverte, excellente cuisine maison, probablement l'un des meilleurs resto sur la rive sud. Martha très sympathique et accueillante :)"}
{"text":"I have been to many brunches places, yet when I went to this place, I felt the change of atmosphere, like being in a quiet place in an European mountain. Every plate has love in its preparation, and it taste like home."}
{"text":"This is a literal hidden gem that is surrounded by residential area. I only been there for brunch, but I can tell they put all their heart in their food, every ingredient might be simple, but all cooked right with just the right seasoning."}
