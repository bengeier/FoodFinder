{"text":"Subs aren't really my go-to meal, but when I heard they had hot subs and fries I was intrigued. It is a franchised chain which seems to be easier to find upon research than how/where the chain got started which struck me as odd. 

Onto the food... The bread was fresh, soft and even though I'm a very slow eater, the bread stayed consistently soft which was impressive. I ordered the steak, cheese and onion. It was a little dry but other than that it was on par with any other chain's generic cheesesteak. The fries were ok, not bad, which is oddly possible. My husband got the bacon cheeseburger and the chicken salad, he said both were ok and he would get it again. 

I'm in no rush to return, but I'm sure we'll eat there again"}
{"text":"I heard about this spot opening up so I came by after a workout at the nearby LVAC. The Beef Bomb sando that they're known for is a hefty sub filled with beef, grilled onions, mushrooms, peppers, and bacon with tomatoes and provolone. It's pretty tasty and I like how cheesy it was, but the beef wasn't seasoned. There also seemed to be mayonnaise on the sandwich, which I do not care for and was not mentioned in description. That said, there's enough on the menu that I'll probably come back and try another sandwich again soon enough.

Since the restaurant recently opened, management was circulating and getting feedback. No one approached me, which may have been an oversight. I would suggest adding silverware to the drink station (had to ask an employee for it from behind the counter) and adding window shades, as the dining room was quite sunny and warm. Hoping they do well in this spot!

TIP: Bring in your LVAC ID for a discount. Wish I'd been asked, considering I came in wearing workout clothes. They also have wheat bread available, but you have to ask for it."}
{"text":"I have already been to Jon Smith Subs twice since they opened and I will definitely keep going back. The service is great, the lady behind the counter was patient and recommended some of the house favorites since it was my first time. The Cajun chicken is so yummy and the fries are amazing. Plus, the fact that it's next door to Starbucks doesn't hurt."}
{"text":"The food was great and the service was even better!! Fantastic menu options. This place is a must if you're in the Vegas area."}
{"text":"I would've took a picture of the food but after the first bite it was devoured... walked out about 15min ago and want to go back. Had a Cajun smoked chicken. Wasn't too spicy but just right. Keep it up. 2 very satisfied customers will definitely be back"}
{"text":"Sandwich was bomb! Staff was friendly and efficient. Store was clean and even had a highchair for my baby, which I didn't expect since they just opened. 
I had the Rueben on Cuban, my husband had the Maple Bacon (with no lettuce) and baby boy had French fries. 
I will definate eat here again."}
{"text":"I was at Starbucks next door and decided to try this place out. It did not disappoint! It was freshly made and it was very juicy (my favorite). I had the steak bomb which had cheese, steak, mushroom, peppers, and onion. I also had my dog with me and they were so nice me about it.  The owner even came over to our table to speak to us! This will definitely be my go to spot from now on when I'm craving a good sub!"}
{"text":"This place is awesome! They have the best subs! The three star reviews have no idea what they are talking about! They must be working for a different sandwich place. When I walked in it was so clean and the employees were super friendly and very helpful. Will definitely tell people about this place. My new favorite sandwich shop!"}
{"text":"This shop that just opened has THE BEST subs I've ever tried. And don't even get me started on those fries !! YUMM. My favorite sub they have is the teriyaki bomb sub. Also won some coupons during their grand opening so I will be definitely coming back ! It's in a great location as well ! Can't wait to go back for a lunch grub !"}
{"text":"My new favorite sandwich shop! I've tried the Smoked Cajun steak- delicious and perfectly spiced with jalape√±os, grilled onions & Cajun seasoning topped with melted provolone. The Cuban was also delicious! Served on real  Cuban bread yummmy!! Service was great and space was clean and the owner is super friendly"}
{"text":"What can I say other than that this place is amazing!!!! Dare I say, they are better than Caprottis. Their ingredients are top notch and fresh. I ordered through Uber eats (huge bonus for people who can't leave work). I got the 6\" glazed teriyaki cheese steak. Let me tell you. As someone who grew up in a sub shop, this placed nailed it. The steak, onion and mushrooms were actually cooked IN the teriyaki sauce.  Everything is made to order. And they have fries as well as chips for those who like something a little different.  All in all, I will definitely order from here again."}
{"text":"Heard it was open so I thought I'd give em a try. In a small strip center right off 215 and flamingo. 


Walked in and was not impressed. Place was filthy. Garbage on floors. Dirty empty tables. I actually had to clean off a table myself in order to have a seat.

 And the place is about the size of a porta potty. Not really much room to sit. Don't come during lunch unless you're getting it to go. Because you won't find a seat.


On to the ordering. Ordered a meatball sub. Placing order was easy. Staff was not very friendly or very helpful. After ordering you either hope to find a table or stand there waiting for them to call your name. Which results in people just standing by the soda fountain machine and all your other drink needs. Very inefficient and annoying to have people standing there texting and instagramming and yelping completely oblivious to their surroundings by being in the way.


Sandwich was ok. Nothing great about it. Nothing bad about thus the average rating. I'll come back after they get some of the bugs worked out."}
{"text":"Maybe caught them on an off day, but the Reuben on Cuban sub came out soggy and a complete mess. For 10$ with drink I'd expect a bit more out of it. Can't say I'll be in any hurry to get back."}
{"text":"Tried a grilled chicken 12\" sub to go last week. It was pretty bland. Just not much taste at all. Service took a little while but since they are new in town, that might be an anomaly. The Mrs wasn't impressed either. May not go back. With the price point it shouldn't be lackluster. Maybe I need to try at steak sandwhich. Even so, if you are making something bland just take it off the menu until you find a way to make it better. Decor is okay. They have an open kitchen similar to Caps. Finishes and lighting are pretty standard. About as uninspiring as the sandwich. Location is a little out of the way because you have to pull into a commercial development and which makes it not worth trying again. I guess if I'm jonesing for a steak sandwhich and I'm in the area, then I suppose I can give it another go. But heck, at least the food wasn't bad and that's why it gets 3 Stars."}
{"text":"Wow!!! Super delicious subs and service!!! From ordering to the taste everything is 5 stars!!! We will be back for sure. Great location and hours. The fries are my favorite fries around town. As a Miami native I had to try the Cuban and see if it was as good as my Cubans in Miami and it was sooooo perfect!!! Authentic homemade fresh baked  Cuban bread with the perfect amount of mustard and pickles in the pork and ham grilled to perfection!  If you never tried a Cuban sandwich do yourself a favor and try this Jon Smith Cuban asap!! I also cannot wait to try the Rueben on a Cuban next!!!! Thank you Jon Smith and welcome to Las Vegas!!!!"}
{"text":"Great sandwich spot added to the neighborhood, heck completely new addition to Vegas! Jon Smith subs is located next to Starbucks off of Grand Canyon and Flamingo, the location is pretty easy to get in and out of thanks to the multiple entrances/exits from the shopping center! 

For my first excursion I shared a 12 inch Steak Bomb(grilled onions, peppers, mushrooms, tomatos, bacon, mayo, and provolone) and a large fry with my mom. I ordered our food to go, upon emptying our bag we discovered a rather large order of fries(think large McDonald's size cup)(yes, I'm a bad Yelper I should have taken a picture) filled over the brim. 
Our sandwich wasn't soggy and the bread was still soft till the last bite! I had never had bacon on a cheesesteak before, I loved it! I tried a bite of just the meat and I found it a tad under seasoned, perhaps I'll ask for extra seasoning next time? 
I'm excited to return and try the Cuban and Maple Chicken sandwich's, work my way through the menu :)"}
{"text":"So, I really want to like this place. I'm not sure if it's just because they're still working on training the staff or what. 
I had the Cajun chicken sandwich. The chicken itself tasted like nothing remotely Cajun I've ever eaten. It was honestly tasted bland except for the enormous amount of liquid smoke flavoring. I agree with the other review, the cheese was on point but the lack of seasoning just made me sad. 
The girlfriend ordered the chicken bomb and had a similar experience. She said it just tastes bland, oh and also she requested an addition to the sandwich that wasn't put on.  I've no doubt that we could've gotten something worked out if we'd eaten there instead of getting it to go.
The ingredients were all fresh, the staff was very polite and accommodating. I will be going back to try something else on the menu though."}
{"text":"I absolutely love this place! All the hot subs are made from scratch right in front of you. They are so delicious I can eat a sub from there EVERYDAY. My favorite is the Cuban but I also love the chicken bomb. Highly recommend!!! 

That staff there is so friendly and nice. If you don't know what to get they will help you find the best choice. 

I love the location because I can head there for a healthy sub after the gym or grab lunch after getting a coffee from starbs"}
{"text":"Came here during their test run! Interior is clean and looks just like any normal sub place. Super friendly staff who even handed out complementary cookies! Quite attentive even while just sitting without ordering and waiting for the rest of my party to join me. They definitely need to invest in some tinted windows or some shades to cover up the sun during sunset though or get ready to be blinded when it's crowded and you can't sit by the tables on the sides. Fries are hot and good! Mushroom steak sub was alright, tastes like a mushroom sub."}
{"text":"Super friendly and attentive staff. Apparently it was a friends and family event, but they were super nice to honor their free sub offer to us. I was asked if I wanted to make it a combo and that was comped too. They didn't have a tip jar, instead they asked for us to come back next week during their grand opening.  I ordered the Italian steak, I should have paid more attention to the menu, totally missed the marinara part.  It was a little too saucy to me and I couldn't really taste all the flavors of the ingredients which was a little disappointing. They could probably go a little heavier on the salt for the perfect sub since my boyfriend ordered the steak bomb and also agreed a bit more salt would have been ok.  Good thing is that they have condiments for you to tweak your sub!  Their fries are actually pretty darn good... YUM! Perfect golden color and a  great crunch to them.  Did I forget to mention their subs are served piping hot and fresh soft bread!!  A lot of sub places have the dreaded dry, roof scraping bread, but not this place!"}
{"text":"The sandwiches are bomb and the employees are so kind!!! I love new places in Vegas like this!!!"}
{"text":"I found out about this place today from a friend.
Had the Tuna (made with Hellman's mayo) and on a wheat freshly baked sub roll. Great portions
You must give it a try, it's in my neighborhood and I will be back there soon.  The also make fries and salads.
Give it a try, you won't be disappointed."}
