{"text":"Nice place! Friendly crew! Good coffee/munchies! But completely (almost) lacking in outlets to plug into... And, NO solar panels to generate electricity for laptops etc or electric vehicles... Sad, really...

{"text":"Stopped in for a latte which was not good.  Probably made with low-quality beans, it had too much foam and was lukewarm.  

They have Dufflet's desserts, so you can't really go wrong there.  I had a date square that was a little over-refrigerated, but I could have waited for it to come to room temperature, I guess.  That's IF I had any patience.

The pictures make this place look nicer than it is.  The dining area is actually pretty depressing.  I feel bad giving this place a bad review.  I wanted to like it.  Maybe their breakfasts are amazing!  Someone else try it and let us know."}
{"text":"Remember little Lauri that was the only good thing left about the Dip 'n Sip near the end of it's tour. I was cutting through the alley near the library at Main and Gerard when someone yells \"hey biker man.\" Well it was about five feet even of Lauri. Said I would be back and today I kept my word. I was so glad to see her I actually left a tip. She is working at the Fade in Cafe at 145 Main St. Make sure you drop in, especially if you crewed the \"Dip\" Enjoy a coffee and say hello.. They got an all day breakfast too. Coffee was good.  .  . (I will update review when I try the breakfast.)  15/07/15 Well 2 eggs bacon toast and hashbrowns with coffee was passable and about 8 bucks with tip. I think the pastry is overpriced so I won't even try it. Did I say the coffee was good?"}
{"text":"Culinary S.'s review from 2013 is very much still relevant today.
This place is cheap and good with counter service. Breakast with three eggs, toast, a hashbrown, three slices of bacon for $4.95. The food is basic diner food that comes out in a reasonable time. The place has a bar so it's a neighborhood hangout.
It's right next to main street library which has wif and workspace."}
{"text":"I like it here... The \"All Day Breakfast\" caught my attention.

This is clearly a neighbourhood spot as the person behind the counter was quite friendly and seemed to know the others coming in. There seems to be a nice selection of easy to prepare comfort food, so far I've only had the breakfast and will likely update my post once I've had more.

The breakfast was nice, nothing fancy. The eggs came perfectly, so did the bacon (three slices). The toast was your typical diner bread. The hashbrown wasn't great, the frozen kind which is fine, but it was a bit undercooked. I had a cappuccino, which was a very mild brew with a good foam.

This is a very casual spot, so if you're comfortable with cozy food and aren't expecting a chef, you'll likely enjoy it here. I'd come back simply because I found the staff so inviting and it's in an area I find myself frequently."}
{"text":"We stumbled upon this movie-themed caf√© after a jaunt to Grinder for an espresso and were pleased to see the $3 all day breakfast special. The quality of the kitchen that it's prepared in is questionable, but it's passable for a two egg and bacon breakfast. I did not like the McDonald's style hash browns. You can get Montreal-style bagels here with butter or cream cheese."}
