{"text":"Great place. My family is usually very demending when it is about breakfast, and we were not dissappointed at all: egg sandwich, tacos, orange juice, espresso coffee, everything was fresh and tasty. Very good and peaceful atmosphere too. I warmly recommend this place....and do not forget to take a look at the cycling shop next door!   Damien (NJ)"}
{"text":"really yummy  sandwiches and salads!  great staff, excellent beer selection!"}
{"text":"Exploring my local area... The baristas here have been super friendly. I came in wanting to check out the local coffee shops and also wanted to expand my coffee knowledge. From behind the counter came nothing but smiles and good conversation - and coffee knowledge! - as I sat sipping my Americano.  Great atmosphere... I feel like a lot of the folks who have come in might be local but that just makes it feel friendlier. Plenty of tables, good light and free wi-fi. Nice little outdoor seating area too which is perfect for Arizona in the spring!"}
{"text":"Whenever you tire of Coors Light bars in Cave Creek, try out Local Johny's for something real.  In the world of chain restaurants, it's refreshing to have a staff that gets to know you and becomes like family.  Love the food, the beer selection, and most of all the staff - Trish, Alex, and Hanna in particular."}
{"text":"Love this place. Delicious coffee and the food is unique, fresh and always on point. So glad to have food of this quality in our little town."}
{"text":"The fish tacos were bomb.  Nice beer selection and... they love bikes, apparently.  I'm into it."}
{"text":"A great addition to our Cave Creek dining options. A friend and I stopped in January 9, 2015 for breakfast. The coffee was great the pancakes were a thing of beauty and the breakfast sandwich very good. Prices were below any other Cave Creek restaurant. OUTSTANDING RD Evans"}
{"text":"Great music with David Sheehy, great wine, great food and great service!  What a local treasure.  Can't wait to come back."}
{"text":"I had a great lunch here today. I highly recommend it and it will become one of my regular places! My mom and I had the cilantro chicken salad- very generous serving and was amazing! My dad had the spirachi turkey sandwich- was fantastic and came with a side salad and cookie!  There is also a bike shop/ repair store here too! Super!"}
{"text":"Just stopped at new incarnation of the old C4 coffee. They did a nice job fixing it up. Had a a very good salad & coffee for lunch. A great addition to Cave Creek and it shares the building with Flat Tire Bike"}
{"text":"Holy yum!! We were up in the area and looking for good food to go and some beers. Local Johnny's was perfect! Even though it was hot, we sat on the patio with our dogs and had a few beers while we waited for our lunch to be ready. The server brought waters for the pups without us even asking. Nice, chill vibe with great food. Don't miss out on the Turkey Sriracha or the Happy Hippy! Wish it was closer to us so we could go more often!"}
{"text":"Great as a casual hip place to hang out with alcohol. Food is better than pub standard but still not great."}
{"text":"What a gem, this great place for breakfast in Cave Creek! We live here part of the year, and like to try all the restaurants. The oatmeal sounded really weird, but it had fantastic reviews. Being in an adventurous mood, I tried it.  YUMMY! Basically using the oats like a polenta or grits- pairing it with savory ingredients. Will definitely order it again. We sat outside- great place for observing the bazillion-dollar rigs driving by. We also had dinner there several nights later. A nice wine selection, they had a good Malbec at a very fair price. And, once again- great food! The owners (a young husband/wife team) pay a great deal of attention to service, cleanliness, quality of food, and interaction with customers. They know what they're doing (I was in the business for a very long time and know when people know their stuff....) their dedication to making this a very enjoyable, a very delicious, a very Cave Creek establishment is apparent."}
{"text":"Local Johnnys puts a capital \"C\" in Community. Great spot loaded with great people, tastiest food from a coffee shop I've ever had, a long list of beers and cocktails and fun-loving hospitality. Lauren and John (owners) are seldom away from this gastro pub vibe coffee shop/ restaurant and their hard work and dedication to their business  makes it easy to get exactly what you need. This place is becoming a cave creek staple, so get your seniority while you can  A CAVE CREEK MUST TRY"}
{"text":"coffee on the shaded porch with a gourmet cookie in the afternoon with our labradoodle, bailey !!!! the best in town !!! wade and nina"}
{"text":"My wife and I went here on a Friday night on the spur of the moment. Not too crowded yet as they have only started opening for dinner a few weeks ago. Limited menu but everything we tried was superb. Shepard's Pie was fantastic. Served beer and wine. A true neighborhood hangout with a bright future.  Dan O."}
{"text":"Great menu selection. Easily accommodates dietary restrictions. Had a custom gluten free flat bread with kale pesto, spinach, ricotta, and mushrooms. Best food I've had in my four days here in Phoenix. Love the cozy casual atmosphere."}
{"text":"I love this place, and you will too. First and foremost, scones. Get there early so you can get 'em when they're warm. And the coffee here is excellent. Better than previous establishments in this location, and they were no slouches with the brew. But if you can't get here in the morning, get here in the afternoon and evening for the other kind of brew. Local Jonny's has a great selection of wines and beers, along with a small but excellent food selection. I keep trying different stuff and it's all been fantastic.  There's some outdoor seating on the dog-friendly front porch, including a comfy leather couch I could be convinced to spend entire days on. The dining room is small, but there's ample seating for a decent number of people both at tables and the bar. Local Jonny's has live music on some evenings, ranging from singer-songwriter types inside to the occasional raucous rock and roll band out in the backyard.  The staff is always friendly and helpful, and because Local Jonny's is next door to the Flat Tire Bike Shop, there's always a lot of activity. In fact,  although they are two different establishments, the two are physically connected. You can enter the bike shop from one end of the restaurant or watch the service department through windows on the other end. It's neat. Local Jonny's is active on Facebook, so follow them to find out about specials and events. We finally have a winner in this location and I wish them great success.  Update - May 2015: I've developed an addiction to the shepherd's pie. It's fantastic."}
{"text":"A phenomenal new cafe that is co-loated with our local bike shop.  Hosts Jon and Lauren will make you feel welcome and special, every time you visit.  The coffee is great and the food to die for.  Local chef 'Kathy' has developed an eclectic menu with traditional favorites and interesting twists.  Ever thought of trying Savory Oatmeal? Yep, oatmeal with a crushed red pepper pesto folded into it, and topped with avocado, egg and tomato.  Also recommend the Berry Pancakes and the Kale & Quinoa breakfast bowl.  Basically you can't go wrong with anything on the menu! Beer and wine available and evening service coming soon."}
{"text":"Awesome little Cafe. Good local coffee and beer. Gluten free stuff isn't so gluten free."}
{"text":"Visiting Scottsdale and found Local Johnny's on yelp. Came once and returned the next day. Great place, food and awesome Bloody Mary's!  Next trip back Will definitely return."}
{"text":"Local Jonny's is everything right! I was excited to see that this place opened up where there used to be a cool spot in Phoenix. This place was exactly what Cave Creek needed.   We had the savory oatmeal and eggs - so unique and tasty. It was very filling and had many complimentary flavored. The egg sandwich was homemade-esque with great flavor.   The ambience is chill, with reggae music and comfortable decor.   Jonny, himself, took our order. A very cool guy."}
{"text":"Stopped here for breakfast on the way to a hike at Spur Cross. Really comfortable place, very good coffee, and good food at reasonable prices.  I'm looking forward to checking it out for a couple of beers some afternoon."}
{"text":"Located in the heart of Cave Creek-we are so fortunate to have non franchise business here! Love the atmosphere- totally casual and friendly. I was in the mood for a salad so I salad had the Cilantro Chicken Salad-good clean and yummy! Perfect for these hot summer days!  Check them out and keep in Local!"}
{"text":"Great local hangout with a wonderful staff. Coffee is full of flavor and they have a small decent craft beer list. They do a nice job of promoting local vendors."}
{"text":"This is a fun, comfortable spot for coffee, brunch, lunch, light dinner, or cocktails. The owners are terrific, and the staff are always friendly."}
{"text":"Great spot! We ate here twice while we were visiting. Once for breakfast and once for lunch. Both my 8 year old son and I were very happy with our meals. I had a breakfast burrito the first time around and the turkey sammie for lunch (AWESOME, btw!).  My son turned 8 (on 3/28 - I mention the date because I'm not sure the name of the two people who were working at the time!) and we stopped in here for lunch. While I was in the bathroom my son told the man and woman working at the counter that it was his birthday. After our meal they brought him out two scoops of ice cream atop two cookies with lit candles (see photo)! We were both surprised and my son was so happy! What a thoughtful and kind thing to do for him! This is the kind of thing that sets restaurants apart from others...you can find good food and poor service almost anywhere, but this place has a staff that cares.  We will most certainly be back during our next visit! Thank you both again for adding to my son's special day!"}
{"text":"THIS PLACE IS SOOOOOOO YUMMY! I came here with my parents while in town and my dad told me to get the Kale Quinoa Power Breakfast bowl and it was one of the most amazing things I've ever eaten. I'm so sad I don't live closer because I'm still craving it now :(  They have really great ambiance and I especially love sitting on the patio and enjoying a coffee or tea. The staff is awesome and super friendly as well!"}
{"text":"This place is great. I got a burger and it was really good. I'm not usually one to mess around with the sanctity of ketchup, but their sriracha ketchup was amazing. Great service and the live music was awesome. I think we have found a new favorite place in downtown Cave Creek."}
{"text":"This was our third visit to Local Johnny's.   Very disappointed.  Messed up my drink order.  Two people missed the not very difficult ingredients.  Then, they misplaced our order.  Finally, after 20 minutes, I went to the counter to inquire.  Then, miraculously, the order would be \"right out\". Later, not right out, our order came out.  My husband's burger was dry and disappointing.  My sandwich was not good. We will return to our regular, Earl's, maybe doesn't have the \"cool\" factor, but ALWAYS delicious.  AND, no attempt to say, Oh, sorry, our bad. And, that was all she wrote! Not going back."}
{"text":"THE place to go for excellent coffee, a relaxed atmosphere, and creative, delicious food.  I usually get their Americano - FireCreek coffee made just right with the water added to the 4 shots instead of the wrong way around. (Jonny's baristas are skilled at their craft.)  The pancakes are justifiably famous, the savory oatmeal is wacky in a particularly tasty way, and everything else I've had there, I look forward to ordering again.  Put all that great food and coffee in such a pleasant location with friendly people - how can you not come here all the time?"}
{"text":"UPDATE:     Well... I've come in the last 2 mornings and I order the spicy breakfast sandwich... it's suppose to have ham on it, but I just add an xtra egg... and well, yumm... it's a solid 8... and the coffee is GREAT!... so, we decided to come in tonight for the \"Burgers and Brews\"... WE WERE NOT DISAPPOINTED!  His burger had the perfect cook on it... all you $hytheads that cook it well done, you need a smack in the mouth!  You ruin it!!! CUT IT OUT!... Anyway... it was lovely, everything was lovely... live music... AMAZING SERVICE... and just rocking on the food...   Old review: Great atmosphere... friendly staff... concept is cool...  LOVE THE BIKES... coffee tasted a little watery, my husband made a comment that it tasted like paper, he was right on... we ordered the savory oatmeal and the kale Quinoa w/egg salad...  the egg, cooked perfect on the salad... for 9$ the portion size was terrible... add more kale, lower the price and ease up on the dressing... as for the oatmeal... let's talk about the lack of seasoning...Please Please dry the poached egg thoroughly... I had to drain the water off the top of the oatmeal... we had to add Tabasco just to give it flavor... the tomatoes weren't ripe, inconsistent on sizes, again no flavor... we will try them one more time... however I will say, if you are going to charge these prices, let's do something about the flavor/seasoning... why a 3  the ambiance, music, staff and the guests that frequent here... this amazing woman gave us her scone... we asked her how it tasted... she was kind enough just to give it to us... told us she comes in every morning just for the scones on her way to work at Brians bbq... says everyone at brians LOVES the scones... so glad they support each other in this small community..."}
{"text":"Stopped in on a whim - great coffee. Had the breakfast burrito and the southwest sunrise breakfast sandwich - both were delicious and great portions. Definitely a place to go in cave creek."}
{"text":"Stopped by for breakfast after being disappointed when our hot air balloon ride was cancelled and this was delightful!! Friendly hellos from everyone and delicious fresh food - what more could you ask?  The breakfast sandwich on sour bread toast was fantastic and the traditional breakfast of eggs, potatoes and thick cut bacon was perfect. The setting was comfortable and relaxed. I'd eat here regularly, but it's a long drive from Chicago, so I'll look forward to visiting next year."}
{"text":"Love this spot. So charming in a great location in Cave Creek.  PROS 1. Tasty food with a number of healthy choices 2. The oatmeal and blueberry pancakes - enough said. 3. Amazing location in cute and quaint (and most importantly, non-chain) Cave Creek 4. Great bar and they have a very awesome Bloody Mary  CONS N/A"}
{"text":"Given the fact we only tried a few things off the menu, I can't be held accountable for everything on the menu. My wife and I each had The Adult Iced Coffee and it was great. I ordered the Black and Blue burger, medium rare (duh!). My wife had the Protein Power Salad. The burger was cooked perfectly, but it didn't seem to have all that much blue cheese. The salad was spot on. Both the dressing and the amount thereof were perfect. The wait staff was great. All in all, if we lived in the area we would be regular customers."}
{"text":"Love, Love, Love this place! My boyfriend and I have been here multiple times since moving to the area!  They have a wonderful selection of beer and wine and the food is very yummy!  We enjoy ordering food and sitting outside during a Friday night happy hour.  Doesn't get much better than Local Jonny's.  They sometimes have bands and the music is always great!  Gotta go there on a Thursday night for trivia night! My pup loves it outside and they have heaters for the chilly nights.  His face says it all!"}
{"text":"Mikey and Ryan were awesome friendly dudes (barista and chef). So the customer service experience was wonderful.    The food:  Veggie bean wrap 10/10. Super tasty. Do yourself a solid and try this. Very satisfying. Avoid the meat sweats people.   The drinks: large iced Americano is a 4 shot yummy drink. No bitterness. Very good and taste like fresh micro roasted beans.   Bonus: they serve beer and have GRAPEFRUIT SCULPIN IPA. If you don't know about it then I will tell you it's the best IPA ever. If you do know about it your probably already making plans to come get a freshly poured pint straight from the tap here at Local Jonnys.  Respect!"}
{"text":"A great spot....Loved my coffee. Very friendly and accommodating to specific needs."}
{"text":"What a Find!!!  My mom and I love to find excellent breakfast and lunch places - and they're hard to find. We've been just about everywhere in the greater Phoenix area. There are some places that have very high Yelp ratings and were disappointing.   I rarely leave Yelp reviews but I HAD to for this place. The food is beyond EXCELLENT.   The place is small and casual with not much outdoor seating. It is clean and well kept, pleasant. You order at the counter (like a coffee house) and they bring out your food when it's ready. It takes a little while which I think is a GREAT thing (they're actually taking time to prepare and cook the food??!? - Love it)  My mom and I split the Savory Oatmeal & Blueberry Oatmeal Pancakes - The Oatmeal was outstanding. The depth of the flavor was incredible and so delicious. Topped with an avocado and 2 perfectly poached eggs. The oatmal tasted like steel cut oats which take a lot of love and time to prepare. This is a SUPERB dish - The Pancakes were equally incredible. Made with what seemed to be toasted oats/granola as they were still cruncy even within the pancake. Beautiful pops of bluberrys in the batter - not soggy at all. Topped with a lovely multiple berry compote and delicous whip cream (pretty sure house made as they were so goooood)  I CANNOT WAIT to go back! Probably this weekend already!  Please try - Support Local!!"}
{"text":"First time we've been in Cave Creek in a few years, and stopped for breakfast...great food and coffee - cool vibe with a bike store/ restaurant space. We'll return!"}
{"text":"Update from last time there. Music was being played but much lower and could enjoy it. Service and food good. Like supporting local business and hope they stay open a long time. Go give this place a shot. Small menu but food looks good."}
{"text":"Pretty good coffee and the flat tire burrito was fresh and not too greasy like filbertos! Cute place too in cave creek that allows doggies on patio. I would come back!"}
{"text":"First time here. One star due to experience and not food. Let me start with the food. Husband ordered the pulled pork sliders and the fries. They were delicious!! I would highly recommend the sliders. I had the chicken tacos. They were ok. Not much flavor but the salsa helped. All the ingredients were fresh but just uneventful.  Coffee was great! Smooth and not bitter.  Now the bad. Needed to use the restroom which is a unisex restroom which had a message on the door as such and it also noted that if you wish privacy that you should lock the door to the restroom. Got it! I entered the restroom and it was a two stall restroom with doors. One stall was being used because it was closed and locked and they other was open and was ajar. I proceeded into the open stall and upon entering there was a man standing and urinating.  Really??!!! The guy couldn't lock the stall door??? I immediately left and I felt this totally ruined my experience.  So parents and women be aware of weird men in the restroom who can't take the effort to lock the door of the stall or restroom door!!!!y"}
{"text":"Owner is very arrogant ,rude an unappreciative . He has lessened the portions of food since he first opened. Seating is very uncomfortable. Also sun is in your eyes because there are no shades on the windows.  I asked the owner why and he said he wants people to eat and leave. This is a not to hangout. Not very cool for a local coffee shop!! not a place to relax. I see this type of owner as very greedy.I wont be supporting"}
{"text":"Been here a few times and really enjoyed the food/service for lunch but today I was very disappointed with their breakfast. After placing my order I receive my drink promptly as usual. The problem was with my food. I waited for 25 minutes for a to go order of traditional oatmeal. I could understand that they were busy so I waited patiently. During this time I see several people come up to the counter about problems with their orders. One woman return with her to go order that had been messed up and the kitchen was making her a new one. When my order did come out it was not to go. This is when I knew I had to check my order. When my to go container came out there were a few pieces of banana on there, what appeared to be one slice strawberry and one blackberry. I had to as for the brown sugar and more berries for my order. This is all after waiting 25 minutes for my order of oatmeal. After this experience, I think I'll just stick to lunch at Local Johnny."}
{"text":"I absolutely love this place!! Been here a few times food is wonderful Coffee great good for everyone"}
{"text":"This place has a really cool atmosphere. The flat tire burrito was fantastic. Service was okay, a little slow. The only other downside was price - $14 for a burrito and a coffee."}
{"text":"Sriracha Turkey sandwich is the best. Comes with some sort of pasta that is also very good. Get one."}
{"text":"This is a cute place with friendly staff. Had breakfast and street tacos. Delicious! Fresh flavor! Filled us up! Coffee was delicious as well. Will definitely revisit when we're back in town."}
{"text":"A great local spot!  I stopped by here for breakfast with my parents and sister for a quick bite to eat.  Little did we know what we had in store for us, and how lucky we would be to stumble across it... Or more so, thank you to Yelp who helped steer us to this place :)!  The lovely people that work there gave us a ton of fun outdoor and bike trail suggestions for us tourists and were overall really nice and cheerful.  The food was amazing.  My parents had the Power Breakfast Bowl the first day--which was super yummy and I definitely \"tasted\" a few bites too many-- sorry rents!  My sister and I opted for the Greek Granola Parfait--also really good--and a latte.  If I do recall, they also had some great music playing in the background, so I was immediately smitten.  We loved this place so much, we were back the next morning.  This time, I went a little crazier and tried the Veggie Breakfast Burrito.  Very different style, but so good!  Incredible.  The lunch items all look wonderful as well and next time I'm in the area, will need to come by for a lunch time brew and snack.  Thank you Local Jonny's, y'all are awesome."}
{"text":"Love. It. Here. I admit, it's a little strange not seeing C4 here. We really loved C4. After a few more weird changes after C4, this place split into 2 and became a bike shop and a coffee/beer/food place. It's bright an happy and they have freaking GREAT COFFEE.   Veggie bean wrap = A+. They have a fairly small yet healthy menu, that is very satisfying.   Mikey was out barista. This kid made us feel right at home - he was super friendly and accommodating. (Why can't all baristas be like him!?) A guy named Ryan made our food, he was great too.  Beer on tap people! Grapefruit Sculpin people! Race over here now!  Outdoor section is totally redone, and looks very nice!   We saw many new people come in and try the place and leave smiling! Mikey even offered people water to go on the way out on this 110 degree day.  These guys are tasty, and got customer service down right!!"}
{"text":"The atmosphere is great! The food is delicious, my only complaint is they messed up our orders pretty bad, they gave us the wrong burger, and forgot avocado on my sandwich, and cooked the eggs way under what I asked.  I really enjoyed the food I just wish they got their orders correct."}
{"text":"Food was fresh and tasty and service was friendly. Have to go to the counter to order then food is brought to you. Soda is out of cans would be much better if it was fountain soda. Ordered burgers and fries and our mouths were on fire. Called someone over and found out it was the ketchup. It's a special ketchup with sriracha hot sauce In it. This would have been helpful to know ahead of time since children were eating too. We did ask for regular ketchup but by then lunch was already ruined by burning mouths."}
{"text":"I have been to LJ's a dozen times. Their food is not that great. I have tried a bunch of stuff and nothing is that good, darn it. The salads are probably the best, if I must. Their beer is awesome!!! The live music, dope! Love the atmosphere. Service is hit or miss. Seems like it was better about 6 months ago. Lately, the servers act annoyed when you ask questions. Maybe the taps change so much they don't know much about the beer? Anyway, they seem bothered a lot lately. It makes the food taste worse! Haha. Overall though, I come in this place to get great local brews, Listen to music and have hope that there will be something on the menu I like. One day, I'm sure!"}
{"text":"We rode our bikes -pedal power not fossil fuel- to Cave Creek and was going to take a quick stop for coffee early Sunday morning. Saw the kale protein bowl on the menu and decided to order it. Yum, yum, yum! The dressing on the salad was amazing!  The perfect meal to fuel me back up for the ride home."}
{"text":"We had a coupon from the kitchen manager for food and drinks because of a really bad meal we had.  Went there yesterday and the waitress was too busy talking to refill our water glasses or find out how the food was.  It was worth another try but we won't be back"}
{"text":"We stumbled across the town of Cave Creek while tracking down a specific dining room light that was listed in stock at the nearby Lowes in Carefree. So glad we did: really quaint and full of charm! Cave Creek that is, not Lowes. :p  We discovered Local Jonny's thanks to Yelp, and so decided to give it a try. Again, so glad we did. Quirky little place with rustic charm. They have a small menu but do have one or two vegetarian options. Oh and they also have a small selection of craft beer. Sweet! We both ordered their veggie bean wrap with a side of slaw. DELICIOUS!! While finishing up lunch a young lad dropped in to play some live music. Talented chap and this rounded off our lunch experience here nicely.   If you're in the area, drop by this place. They have wonderful food and drinks plus it's a cool place to just hang out."}
{"text":"We don't live close to Local Jonny's but that doesn't ever stop us to make the drive. From their delicious black coffee to their outdoor seating that allows dogs, we love coming here. Whether you want coffee, beer, and/ or mimosa this place will quench your thirst. The breakfast and lunch menus have never disappointed and are the reason I want to come back and try it all. Hope you enjoy this treasure as much as I have. Cheers."}
{"text":"Excellent! Love their local roast coffee best of all. We have have breakfast there about 5-6 times and ordered several different things, all of the food is wonderful I recommend the burrito, (it comes with egg, sausage and ham!) or the pancakes. The atmosphere is really rustic and quant, and it's great to sit out front on a cooler cave creek day while you sip coffee. The staff is friendly and quick, taking orders and getting your food and beverage out fast. I suggest checking them out on a weekday, it's a popular spot and weekends can get hectic! Enjoy!"}
{"text":"This was such a cool little place! You go in and order at the counter, pay, then they bring your food! A decent selection of breakfast choices without being too overwhelming; a nice variety of sweet, savory, healthy and vegetarian options. They also have a bar, and a coffee bar but I only had black coffee and water. They did have $6 bloody Mary's which maybe they do every Sunday!? Cozy inside seating offering high tables, booths, and even a big couch and chairs to read the paper. Oh, and outside seating.  I'd definitely go back! The veggie burrito was excellent :)"}
{"text":"Amazingly unique with delicious food and cocktails. Knowledgable staff that helped find a great gluten free meal for my wife with Celiac's disease. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"After hearing a lot about the local coffee and good food from local Jonny's I had to try it myself. Immediately welcomed at the door, I became transfixed with the positive energy of the employees, the customers and the stores over all vibe. The food was fresh and tasty and the coffee was fresh and real quality. Would definitely recommend this restaurant."}
{"text":"Located in heart of cave creek town local Johnny's has great food, prices, and service. The sandwiches are my favorite."}
{"text":"Will clearly be returning to this establishment. I got a bag of chips on the side after hearing that the street tacos had no side dish. You do not need the chips because the street tacos are huge and filling. Loaded with white chicken, pico and a sneaky avocado sauce these monsters do the trick. The quesadilla with chicken and green chiles was top notch as well. I only tried an iced coffee, but that was just standard coffee over ice. Great place for lunch."}
{"text":"This is a \"biker bar\" but of the Schwinn variety rather than the vroom-vroom bikes so popular in Cave Creek.  Cute, homey place with a small menu (this is usually a good sign and in this case, it was) and lots of coffee-shop beverages.  The folks were extremely friendly and it was a lovely spot to sit and chill for a while.  I'd like to come back in the evening to try the mac n' cheese."}
{"text":"Stopped in here for lunch. Enjoyed a great coffee (vanilla latte). Hard to find a good coffee, so I will be back for that alone. I had the lunch special, a turkey club. Was very tasty and fresh. My husband enjoyed the the black bean veggie burger, was seasoned nicely. Very cute place and the staff was very friendly. Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Fantastic service,  great fast paced place with very good food! Look for it!   Very welcoming!"}
{"text":"Food was ok, but waitstaff was rude and impatient when asking any questions. Hungover? Hate their jobs? Maybe a bit of both? Who knows. Also, if you want a refill on water they'll be sure to roll their eyes and not make it happen. With how great the reviews are, I may try it again but will have low expectations.  Update: Owner reached out to follow up. Places who have owners like this definitely deserve a second chance. I'll update the review to 3 stars, and after my second visit I'll be sure to update it again."}
{"text":"A great place for coffee,a snack or a meal.friendly accommodating staff,and a funky vibe. Meet your friends,stop in to relax or maybe a date nite."}
{"text":"What a wonderful find for four lifetime friends wandering through the desert while celebrating their friendship and turning 60. Young and dynamic artsy servers provide great coffee, inventive bloody spicy Mary's, craft local beers, and delightful breakfast burritos, Protein salads, flat breads and perfect salsa. The setting is rustic in the best and inviting way. Can't recapture youth but the meal and surroundings reminded us how brilliant is one's spring."}
{"text":"Overall I enjoy this place! The sliders & beer are great but avoid the fish tacos, they were over cooked and seasoned horribly and so dry! But the band, beer and people are awesome!"}
{"text":"Stopped in here for breakfast and it wasn't bad. The menu is a bit limited, but the staff is friendly and the food was fresh and hot. A bit on the 'healthy' side, but I was able to make do."}
{"text":"Local Jonny's is a breath of fresh air for this area! I like my cowboy bar, coors light, and bbq as much as the next person, but it is very nice to have a change of pace. Local Jonny's is like a bar you'd find in Tahoe or Bend - laid back, lots of stone/wood, craft beer, and food made with fresh produce.   I had the vegetarian breakfast burrito and my companion had the 2 egg platter. The food was fine and suffered from the fact that I went to Butters Cafe the next day for lunch and their breakfast food pretty much is the best I've had in the valley. The platter was on the small side and the burrito was just basic. I saw other people's lunch orders which looked a lot more appetizing, so we'll try that next time.   When the weather is cooler they have a really cool outdoor side patio that looks like the perfect place to enjoy some beers with friends."}
{"text":"I love this place.  Good food, good beer selection, and good tunes.  What more could you ask for.  Great place to day drink!  You need more details? Come here and try it yourself and write a stinking review. I'm far too relaxed."}
{"text":"Chill, friendly atmosphere -good coffee. Decent food. Fun to people watch. Sharon was attentive and helpful."}
{"text":"Here from California visiting friends and checked this place out for breakfast. Amazing! A must for anyone great service and atmosphere, also dog friendly on the patio"}
{"text":"Very happy to notice this place on Yelp! Great beers  on tap and, from our small sample, very solid food. Oh. And a great price. We had the pork sliders and fish tacos. The sliders had the right amount of sauce and a nice spice. The tacos were really good. A touch of heat and great composition. We will not only be back, but will bring friends."}
{"text":"Great place, have only been here for coffee and breakfast. Staff is all very friendly And the food is good. Great place to have coffee and read the paper. If you want a relaxing visit go when cave creek has less tourists. Weekdays between 8-10 is probably perfect."}
{"text":"I don't know how you folks are rating or if your basing your review on some sort of bias. I just paid 9 dollars for the equivalent of a McDonald's egg mc muffin. English muffinthawed out pre-made low quality sausage pattycrappy generic cheese. Sandwich complete.........Can't see this one surviving. I use yelp for every new restaurant I try and am extremely disappointed by you other yelpers."}
{"text":"Great spot... busy with locals.  Pretty decent food with friendly and quick service; we had the blueberry pancakes and breakfast burrito.  Loved the trivia cards at the table - played while we waited."}
{"text":"Been here twice now. Once for breakfast although we just ordered a breakfast sandwich to go so didn't experience the cafe or bottomless mimosas which we will be back for! Lunch was awesome! We had the beef tacos and the fish tacos. The flavors were complex and fantastic! Just enough spice to get your attention but did not over power the other flavors. We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Had the savory oatmeal this morning. Steel cut oatmeal with poached egg, red bell pepper pesto, tomatoes, avocado and feta cheese. You mix it all together when you get it served. Very tasty. Not sweet. It truly is savory. Very creative dish"}
{"text":"Wow..... where to start. 1st I am a sandwich junkie. The bread, meats and craftsmanship of these sandwiches are undeniably epic. Simple, classic recipes with a perfect AZ Cave Creek twist. The Wicked Pig and the Sriracha Turkey are perfect both served with a Orzo salad that is light and refreshing.  2nd the Bloody Mary's are the best in Phoenix. Delightfully spicy served with a dill pickle and green olives.  Plus they serve local Firecreek coffee!!!"}
{"text":"This is a fun little local place. You order at the counter of a bar to get food. We ate breakfast and it took awhile for our family of five to get our food. The food was okay. The coffee prep area was in the back of the place. We had to go back to the counter for everything, like butter. The experience was alright, overall."}
{"text":"We try to support local businesses when we can.  We've been here about six times, at different times and on different days, and it seems like it's always the same. The food is good. I haven't tried a whole lot,  it I do love their egg sandwich with avocado instead of sausage. It is so delicious! It's a nice little set up, but the service is just so dang slow. It makes sense on a busy Sunday morning, but on a Tuesday afternoon, not so much.    I would recommend this place for sure, but not if you're in a hurry."}
{"text":"Received a note back from management - so figured I best update. Great reviews, so we thought we'd give it a chance.  We ordered at the bar as is the custom.  No problem there - but the system asks for tip up front - we thought it only gives you three options for tip, which is requested BEFORE any service or any food to taste.. odd.  We missed that you can select either custom or no tip.  That's good - wish we would have noted that at the time!  Our bad.  Just for me - it's odd to tip a normal 20+ percentage when you order at the bar, run your payment yourself, and the service is really only bringing the food to the table. The food was good.  Not OMG WOW THIS IS GREAT - but good and solid.  (We ordered burgers).  The service - friendly - but normal - nothing out of the ordinary. The beer?  Cold - but again - not a lot of selections, but it was good.  It was trivia night - so the place was busy - and the person coming around to the tables to talk was LOUD.  Lots of background noise and not much ability for the location to muffle. It was also an expensive evening out.  Probably won't be back, but I think a lot of folks won't have a problem with the things that distracted me."}
{"text":"Great food/drink and service. Staff are always friendly and helpful. Veggie bean wrap is very good. Good selection of beers as well."}
{"text":"Came here yesterday for an afternoon snack with a friend. The staff at the front was kind of short with us, not very friendly. We ordered the spinach dip and an espresso drink. The spinach dip was okay and the coffee was pretty tasty."}
{"text":"This is our favorite place in Cave Creek to go to since we moved here. Friendly staff and a nice variety of healthy and yummy food choices and drink selections that are a little bit reminiscent of the cafes we are use to from Los Angeles. I  am hoping for vegan options in the future (hint hint) but vegetarian options are available (they are more than willing to accommodate any requests). We love the sun-dried tomato aoli sauce and fries and the Sunrise Breakfast Sandwich. They have a nice bar and even Kombucca on tap. Walk up to order and they bring it all out for ya. Cool coffee bar atmosphere and outside covered seating which is very dog friendly. We bring our St Bernard with us all the time."}
{"text":"I got the impression that mostly Locals really do love it here. I saw many people riding their bikes here and people sipping coffees and banging away on their computers. The vibe is very friendly. The atmosphere is warm with a fireplace and is sort of rustic but with modern touches. This is a small Breakfast - Coffee - Lunch Cafe  - with Wine and Beer that sits in the Flat Tire Bicycle Shop. The menu is limited but does offer some unique eats.  I went with the Grilled Rye Sriracha Turkey Sandwich. The tasty rye was nicely grilled and the turkey seemed like your everyday lunch meat turkey. The sandwich was tasty with the Sriracha Cole Slaw but this sandwich had a drip factor that might be high for some people. The plate was presented nicely with a sort of Black Olive/Corn relish and a fresh baked chocolate chip cookie.  My husband had the Grinder Sandwich (without the Mayo). It was filled with Ham, Soppresata, Provolone, Olive Bruschetta, lettuce and tomato. The meat is the sandwich was mainly ham on Ciabatta Bread. This plate was also presented with some Black Olive/Corn Relish and a fresh baked chocolate chip cookie.  An Alternative to eating the mostly BBQ or mostly Mexican in the immediate area.  Worth a Try when your visiting Cave Creek."}
{"text":"Great place with great service. I really enjoyed the craft beer on tap and always rotating with something new. A must stop while your in the Creek."}
{"text":"Great food, great service....some unique breakfast items.....love the Power breakfast bowl.....I got mine with poached eggs.....would love the lemon vinaigrette recipe.....look forward in returning before we head home....."}
{"text":"Always A great experience in atmosphere and food. Love sitting on the front patio and watching the traffic go by. Good beer line as well"}
{"text":"Coffee great food great def must try if you've never been super cool hole in the wall you mistake for a bike shop"}
{"text":"Super fun place in the middle of tourist central. Laid back, coffee shop vibe with a real bike shop attached-like the kind where people who build bikes work. Excellent food, service and ambiance. The savory oatmeal is most delicious and unique!! Refreshing change from the usual in this area!!!"}
{"text":"Love this little spot.   Food is excellent!  Breakfast food was amazing.  Good meeting spot for friends in the morning."}
{"text":"Local is the best! We support family businesses. Our food was delicious. We had the southwest wrap & pro turkey sandwich with a side of their potatoes wedges. Service was attentive and friendly especially for an order at the counter café. They had a good selection of food for any appetite. We will have to go back for breakfast. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"I'm new to the area and today was the first time we came here because I've heard so many great things about their pancakes I just had to go try them. I was really disappointed. First the feel, it's a confusing place, is it a coffee shop, a diner, and bar? You have to get your own menu, seat yourself and order at the bar, you pay and tip before you're served. The coffee was okay (I would get an extra shot in my latte, it was weak) when we finally got them, the mocha wasn't good, it was mostly whip cream and tasted like bitter hot chocolate.  The pancake were not good. They were all varying degrees of cook, 3 of the 4 I got were very under cooked 2 completely raw in the middle. Some had all granola and no batter and there were maybe 4 blueberries. The staff was friendly and asked for feedback, apparently they have two cooks that aren't on the same page and an old griddle (sounded like excuses). They gave us a voucher for a free breakfast, but with the famous pancakes not being good I am unlikely to ever use it."}
{"text":"Went here for the first time last week. Food was excellent, really good fresh sandwiches and great craft beer. You place your order at the bar and they bring it to you-they could put a sign up that says \"order here\", I watched an older couple walk out after they were not waited on. No servers=no waiters! It was very clean, and the bartender was happy to let us taste the craft beers before selecting. Delicious and LOCAL, go check it out! Don't forget to check out the Flat Tire next door if you are into biking, very friendly staff even if you are just looking they are happy to answer questions."}
{"text":"Local Jonny's is a hidden gem. This restaurant provides a breath of fresh air in a sometimes stagnant and monotonous town of Cave Creek. For those seeking a lively establishment with a real sense of community, this is your spot.  The staff is accommodating and personable. I've yet to encounter an unfriendly or uninteresting character working behind the bar. From personal experience I recommend their southwest sunrise sandwich or savory oatmeal. Their breakfast menu is outstanding, but don't sleep on their lunch/dinner options, they're criminally underrated.   Great coffee provided from Firecreek Coffee based out of Flagstaff, AZ. Constantly rotating craft beers on draft (Local breweries too). Decent selection of both liquor and wine. I find it difficult to believe there is not at least one thing Local Jonny's provides that would not appeal to the average person. Jack of all trades, master of all too? Local Jonny's is definitely a worthwhile destination if you happen to find yourself in the beautiful town of Cave Creek."}
{"text":"Was looking for a local place to try while here on vacation from ND.  Staff was very friendly and helpful.  The food was very good. Had  spinach and creamed avocado salad and potatoes with sirrachia catsup  The coffees were most excellent with very  thick fluffy froth. Jonny is awesome and very personable. A must stop when here again"}
{"text":"Tried Local Johnny's recently. Glad we did. My wife had the Turkey Pro, my daughter had the classic eggs, bacon and toast and I had the Roadhouse Burrito.   Each dish was equally good and and tasty. The place seemed to attract a very nice crowd and they all seemed to enjoy the place as much as we did.   The reason for 4 star v 5 star was the food took twice as long as we expected to bring out. Did not impact our morning and meal.   We will go to Local Johnny's again and recommend the restaurant to others."}
{"text":"New burgers added to an already great menu. Salads are excellent and the staff is courteous and friendly.  One of the gems of Old Cave Creek"}
{"text":"We had burgers and it was a super delicious burger! Customer service was great. Laid back environment. Enjoyed my coffee. If I lived near Local Jonny's I would probably frequent it often."}
{"text":"Haven't made it here for any of the live music in the evenings, but have had breakfast and lunch quite a few times and never been less than very happy!  Not to mention countless gallons of coffee, all topped with pretty designs by the baristas.    I am going to say off the bat I have never tried their baked goods.  The scones and muffins and a plate of chocolate chip cookies are all sitting on the counter with customers and counter help breathing and sifting dust and stuff all over them and I think that is ick.  Too bad, because when the place was C4, I loved snagging a scone (from a case!) and a coffee to start my day.  I love a good scone.  But that is the only negative thing I can say.  I debated if I should drop a star because of that, but I don't know if I should visit my germ obsession on such nice people, so I didn't.  (Okay, I am being lenient because I really like this place.)  Otherwise, everyone who works here, including Jonny and Lauren, the owners, are just the nicest, most care-about-your-experience people.  Love their crazy breakfasts---read what the Savory Oatmeal or Power Bowl breakfast is and you are like wha...?  Then you have them and you are like, \"Wow\".  My only problem is either of those are so filling that I am done eating for the day!  They stoke you up!  Love their lunches.  Have been working my way thru the menu and have not yet had a salad or sandwich that isn't delicious and fresh and usually has a bit of a twist that makes you go: Oh?  and then OH!  But I am already learning what my favorites are, lol!  Never tried their burgers, but I don't eat burgers out.  Unless it's In-and-Out but that's a special case.  Even if most of the tables aren't occupied, there is a constant stream of locals going in and out with to-go coffees and breakfasts and lunches.  It's a busy place, but you always feel like a individual and they are happy you are there.  They welcome you, give you smiles, check in with you and ask sincerely if you are enjoying your food.    The other day at lunch some Moms came in with three or four kindergarten age kids and there was some discussion if there was anything suitable for little kids to eat.  The server heard and came over and I don't know what happened, but she arranged to accommodate little kid tastebuds because when I finished my sandwich and left, moms and kids were chowing down.  I thought that was nice.    Wish them all success, though I don't think they need my good wishes---they are doing great all on their own.  Hope they keep it up!"}
{"text":"We popped into this place for a late breakfast/early lunch.  The people working there were very nice.  My husband said the tacos were okay.  I ordered the protein power bowl and it was SO BLAND!!!!  It needed more dressing and salt.  With all the great places to eat, we don't feel the need to go back."}
{"text":"Great spot to grab a burger.   We have been in a few times an always had a delicious meal.  You order and pay ahead of time and they you are given a number and food taxes 20-30 mins.  Good beer choices on tap! Yummy potato wedges served with the burgers!  Clean co-ed/shared bathrooms:)"}
{"text":"Salads are super fresh, street tacos are the best I have ever eaten, the turkey sandwich very good, blueberry granola pancakes very good get the half portion unless you are starving, they are big, coffee is great and try the pistachio muffin you will like it. That is everything we have eaten here and nothing disappoints."}
{"text":"Hadn't been up here since C4 went away, but Vince and I finally went in on a tip from a neighbor!  We are so glad. Its our new favorite Go-To for delicious food, fun music. Not an elaborate menu so don't expect a book of everything....if you're looking for a book of food to choose from, try one of those silly chains that offers everything in way too big family size portions. Geeez..  What they do have at Local J is FABULISO! Salads are refreshing and tasty, pork sandwich was yummy, and various other appy's and tappas are delightful. Fun, casual hang out especially for the loco locals!  We love what they did with the place and will continue to chill here as long as they'll have us!"}
{"text":"Eight of us stopped in for dinner...having looked at the website and seeing the menu, I was prepared for the sandwich/salad offerings, but also was expecting specials, such as mussels, which were pictured on the website.  No such luck.  The ordering process is inefficient at best...I got my wine delivered to me at the register, but my husband waited over 15 minutes for his bourbon and water at the beverage pick up spot.  And the gal serving the drink was hostile when he mentioned the delay.  You are also expected to tip on the meal when you place and pay for your order at the cash register/order spot.  Tip before any service is given?  That's an interesting concept.  We placed our dinner orders within minutes of each other, and the food came out at 15 minute intervals...the first two were done eating by the time the last four got their meals.  And we all had sandwiches.  The food was fairly good, in spite of the fact that most hamburgers came well done when they were ordered medium.  All in all, as a local, I have too many other spots to choose from so won't be returning to this spot."}
{"text":"Great breakfast foods, burgers and Bloody Marys. Friendly service. I Always stop in when I'm the area."}
{"text":"I really liked this place. A warm and friendly place where locals like to go. We sat for a nice long time enjoying our drinks without being bothered. Later a guitar player came in for some pleasant entertainment. Didn't try any food but what I saw others getting looked good so the next time I go back I want to try something."}
{"text":"I didn't enjoy the CAVE CREEK shopping area, touristy and gaudy. The coffee here was decent, good service. I really liked the wall w marathon bibs."}
{"text":"Great food, friendly staff and comfortable environment. What more can you ask for? Great place to get lunch, coffee & listen to music."}
{"text":"I've been here three times now and I really like it! The food seems a bit \"different\" but it is absolutely delicious! It's not the cheapest place but you can tell from the quality of the food that it's worth it! The staff is friendly and helpful. I'm excited to be a new Cave Creek resident so I can stop by more often and keep exploring the menu!"}
{"text":"We went this weekend with some friends visiting from the UK.  This is the coolest little place.  They had a guy playing guitar and singing.  He was so good.  The food was the best.  I ordered the waffle with strawberries.  So good!  My husband had a breakfast sandwich on rye.  Wow!  My friends were very impressed too.  I will be going back for sure."}
{"text":"The Firecreek coffee and Chai Tea used to be my favorite thing here, until they added FIVE burgers to the menu! I can't stay away from the Cowboy Burger. We still get the coffee & tea though. :)"}
{"text":"We stopped here after a long hike. We were hungry and thirsty and this place killed two birds with one stone! We had a Turkey Sandwich, Sea Salt chips and an Orange Blossom beer. Man, did that ever hit the spot! The folks working there we awesome and kind as well.  Thanks and I think that I have new favorite beer!"}
{"text":"Try the California sandwich. It was awesome. Coffee was good and the service was super friendly."}
{"text":"I have always come in for the powerful Protein Bowl. The kale and quinoa are blended so well and the lemon dressing is the right match to the sliced hard-boiled eggs. Where else can you get probiotic kombucha on tap? I have to get it every time. The chef was so agreeable to come out to help my coworker make an enjoyable choice for his current sugar free diet."}
{"text":"Had the blackened fish tacos! Wow spicy and awesome!! I'll be back and recommending this to friends!"}
{"text":"We really enjoy Local Johnny's. The coffee is good and the pancakes are fabulous. We also enjoy the Power Breakfast Bowl. Very clean and comfy.  We had the flatbread and the taco's too. I don't think I would order  those again. We wanted mussels but no one knew how to cook them. Oh well maybe next time."}
{"text":"We decided to try this new restaurant, my wife and I could not be happier with our experience. The restaurant has a really cool bike store attached to it, giving you the feeling of something you might experience in the east village in New York. We ordered a homemade blueberry muffin, delicious, an egg sandwich and a breakfast burrito  all hitting the right notes. The side of their homemade salsa was just the right condiment for these dishes. Congratulations to chef Cathy. The coffee was a refreshing change from the usual $1.50 all you can drink coffee you get in most restaurants in the area. If you like coffee as much as I do you will enjoy this coffee. And finally the staff and owner were friendly and helpful. Give this place a try."}
{"text":"After all the great reviews, I was disappointed in the sit-down experience. If I'm going to sit down and order a meal (not just  scone or muffin), coffee mug refills should be free, not 50 cents, especially when I paid $2 for an 8oz coffee in the first place. If you're going to serve coffee, you've got to be willing to do refills for free for your guests who buy meals.   I was surprised when the kale and boiled egg salad came. For some reason, I was thinking the kale would be sauteed or something since it's billed as a breakfast item. It was a bunch of kale in a bowl, accompanied by 2 boiled eggs and about 1-2 TBSP of quinoa. Guess I should have asked more questions. My friend has the egg sandwich and said it was very good."}
{"text":"Went here today for lunch and got a kale, hard boiled egg, avocado salad with a lemon vinagarette. It was both tasty and healthy which I love. The atmosphere was fun and quaint. Prices were perfect for the amount of food and I couldn't be happier!"}
{"text":"Amazing iced coffee and incredible scones. We tried the apple cinnamon scone and raspberry white chocolate scone and both were incredibly delicious.  I enjoyed my iced coffee, and wish I could find scones as good as these in Portland, they truly are remarkably delicious.    We were quickly greeted with a friendly face, and were efficiently served.  We quickly popped in while on our way to another destination, so we got our treats and coffee to go, and if I'm ever in Phoenix again I will definitely head out here for some iced coffee and a scone."}
{"text":"I love everything about this place. I usually do take out for lunch because we work close by. Great place to sit and chat over coffee. Casual. Menu is innovative/fresh/accurate and fairly priced. Spicy Veggie Bean Wrap is my favorite."}
{"text":"Food was excellent. Limited menu, but what we had was delicious. Would recommend the blueberry oatmeal pancakes."}
{"text":"Everything about this place is great! Kombucha on tap, Bloody Mary's made with green chili vodka, and the best tuna salad sandwich made with crunchy green apple. I never order tuna salad at a restaurant but I crave Local Johnny's. The atmosphere is so comfortable and welcoming. Food can take awhile but it's so worth the wait."}
{"text":"I've stopped in here twice after finishing a ride, or after dropping off my bike at Flat Tire Bike shop (to which Local Jonny's is attached).  I've had the Sriracha turkey and the wicked pig sandwiches. Both were really tasty. The people who work there couldn't be friendlier. This is the quintessential neighborhood place with good food, good people, and a good vibe. You don't have to be a cyclist to go there. I've seen families there, bumped into riding friends there, and seen out of state visitors to cave creek wander in."}
{"text":"It's a small little coffee shop/eatery that's easy to miss if you're not looking for it, but it's definitely worth the stop. They serve breakfast all day on the weekends, they have a fully functioning coffee bar, and have a good selection of beers on tap.   I had the drunken sliders and they were seriously delicious. Their BBQ is amazing, the meat was tender, and they remembered to toast the bread before putting the meat down, which makes all the difference. And they have homemade ranch, which is a big plus in my book."}
{"text":"Good food, very original menu. Coffee was better then most around. Original review is still posted below. I was contacted by the owner and I feel that level of customer service required and upgraded rating.   Nice people and interesting menu. The oats and peppers with avacado and poached eggs was very good. Coffee is not bad either. Set-up is order at the counter and they play where's Waldo finding the owner of the food. If you like the laid back \"hippie\" \"whatever\" atmosphere this is a solid option. If you want a professional culinary experience when your out, skip this one."}
{"text":"Great location, right next to all the little western shops. The atmosphere is very cozy with a modern cabin type of feel. The service was extremely friendly, even when they mixed up my order (accidents happen) they realized it immediately and offered me a free coffee. I got the veggie breakfast burrito and an iced mocha and they were both delicious! I don't live in the immediate area but I will definitely go back anytime I'm in Cave Creek!"}
{"text":"OMG!!!! Best burger in Cave Creek!!!!  Totally a cute coffee lounge & bar with a dog friendly patio.  It seemed to take an inordinate amount of time to get our food, but it was totally worth the wait.   My mom had the kale veggie breakfast wrap. Her only suggestion was that the kale could have been cut smaller to make it easier to eat.  As previously mentioned the burger was to die for. The pretzel bun was fresh and added the perfect amount of salt. The meat was juicy and flavorful. And the ketchup added a nice Arizona kick to the meal. I can't wait to go back next time I'm in town."}
{"text":"The food is great!!  The menu is very limited, but what they have is very very good.  The owner is around most of the time and the staff is very attentive.  There is nothing fancy about the restaurant, and yes, you do order from a counter, but the prices are very good.  All in all, I would return there often!!"}
{"text":"Great local coffee and breakfast that won't break the bank. The fraps are better then Starbucks and the muffins are made fresh!"}
{"text":"Stopped in after golf for a quick bite - fish tacos and the grapefruit sculpin beer was fantastic! Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Went there with a group of friends for New Year's Eve.  They did a nice job, good music, good food.  My only complaint is that the only gin they offer (I like my martinis!) is a small batch boutique gin, which I thought was awful."}
{"text":"Not a Local  Stopped here for a quick lunch. I don't like when they make you leave a tip before you have the service. You order at a counter and they ask for the tip before you finish the transaction. Isn't the whole point of a tip to give an amount based on the service you received? Anyway, maybe just me but that bugs me.   I thought the food was okay. I ordered a salad. It was good but a small-ish portion for the price and just sorta okay for taste. The chicken on it was quite good though, but that's about all I found remarkable about this place. Oh...and also that it's connected to a  bike shop which was notable.   I'm not local, was in town on business but even if I was from the area I don't know of anything here that would bring me back into this place...except maybe if my bike broke down."}
{"text":"First. Best hospitality and a great staff. Two. It's connected to a bike shop. And finally, the food, especially the tacos and breakfast burritos are off the hook. Hannah, Tabitha, Cassie and Alex rock the bar big time.  Totally worth the drive. Find me at the end of the bar. Oh, Thursday they have trivia night!"}
{"text":"Great local coffee shop. Good service, good food, good drinks (coffee and adult bevvies), good vibe! Happy hour specials and local music. Worth the stop day or night!"}
{"text":"First time trying Local Johnny's and were very happy we stopped by and already looking forward to coming again.  I had the Build a Breakfast and the bacon was phenomenal.  Was a KY Bourbon based bacon and was not overly salty.  Great smoky flavor and the eggs were cooked to perfection for sunny side up.  My other half had a breakfast Burrito that had both sausage and bacon and the standard eggs and cheese as well on a wheat tortilla shell.  He said coffee was really good, local brew called Firecreek. Atmosphere is open and friendly and clean. Love to see the steady customers which show it should be around for a while.  You won't regret the drive to come try them out."}
{"text":"I too, was inspired to try the savory oatmeal! Yum! Coffee was so smooth and very good, it hit the spot. Lots of people are taking the pastry to go.  They look great but the oatmeal is so filling it will need to wait for another visit."}
{"text":"Local Johnny's is my favorite place for breakfast! Great vibe, great food, amazing patio seating and super friendly staff. It is our Saturday morning happiness! LJs also has a dog friendly patio and they are really nice to the dogs that visit. It's my dog Coopie's favorite spot in the valley! Everything on the menu is amazing! My go to is the Egg Sandwich with Potatoes! Great pours on the mimosas too!!!"}
{"text":"The food was good... yummy blueberry pancakes.  That being said, the people behind the counter had an unfriendly attitude.  We accidentally ordered an extra latte... well actually we didn't... but we were officiously told that we did and that we'd be charged for it even though it hadn't been made yet.  They expressed annoyance that we asked for water and again that they needed to clear our table when we were finished with our meal....all in all I left the restaurant with a bad unhappy feeling. Don't think I'll be back."}
{"text":"Wow! Fantastic meal and service today, even though we arrived ten minutes before they closed. We split a black and blue burger and a spinach and avocado salad.  The best lunch we have had for weeks!"}
{"text":"I'm a pancake snob. I bring my own real maple syrup to places. Live in Carefree, Az.. Our lovely \"in\" spot  changed owners and pancakes so ordinary now. Not worth the calories.  Drove to Cave Creek based on reviews of Local  Johnny's. Wow!!! Outside it was Cave Creek. But inside, Cape Cod. Williamsburg, Brooklyn. The Lower East Side. Fabulous. Comfortable. A copy of The NYTimes. Friendly service. And Famous Johny's Pancakes.........delicious! Good coffee. Nice people.  Will be back. This is my place now.  Has beer and wine, lunch and dinner. Will try it all. Go! Enjoy!"}
{"text":"We liked the name and the food was even better! The coffee was just right and portions will fill you up. The pancakes are huge and the home fries have a great taste to then. They are not too salty. Atmosphere is relaxed like a surfboard shop!"}
{"text":"Great coffee....and nice people.  Good food....am just getting acquainted but so far so good.  My husband liked the beer and the sandwiches were yummy!"}
{"text":"bikes, beer , food! What more do you want? Been here many times.  Try the upslope lager.  nice wait staff laid back."}
{"text":"Love this local joint. The elote dip is  and their johnny's favorite burger is a favorite of my fiancé's. We've been meaning to drop in when they have live music."}
{"text":"Was out visiting my sister from San Diego. Had a great meal followed by excellent music provided by David Sheehy."}
{"text":"Decent wine and beer menu. Cool and laid back. Good breakfast and fish tacos. Chill vibe"}
{"text":"Thursday. 1230. Impromptu lunch with a girlfriend. There was one couple ordering when we arrived. We sat down with menus to decide what to eat. I went back up to order, no waiting. The order taker was efficient and calm. Not fake friendly but seemed to care about her service. We split the Greek salad and veggie burger. They put the order on two plates for no extra charge. The salad was fresh and the dressing had a zing I already want more of. The only weird thing was green olives instead of kalamata olives. The burger was yummy. They grill the brioche bread in some gooey yummy pesto. It was like a healthy light greasy burger, greasy in a good way (not in a gross way).  We will definitely hit it again."}
{"text":"I'm increasing my rating due to great customer service and follow-up by the owner about my complaints. It's clear they care very much about their business and the satisfaction of their customers. As for the food I finally got to try - I can't say I was in love with it, but some else might be. Anyway, it's worth giving this small business a try."}
{"text":"Food was great!!! Always a favorite when we go in town! The staff is friendly and always welcoming"}
{"text":"Local Johnny's wins for most adorable coffee shop in town!! The atmosphere is super relaxed, funky, and cozy. I love the fireplace! I went on a Sunday afternoon and the place was fairly empty. I got an espresso con panna, which is an espresso shop with whip. It was $2.50, which isn't bad but it was really small. The espresso was STRONG! I had to put cream in it, which I usually don't need to do! Overall it was decent. I probably wouldn't go out of my way here to  grab a cup of joe, but I definitely would stop if I were driving by. I would be curious to check out the Thursday night trivia. I reccomend!"}
{"text":"Good, unique craft beer selection, great iced coffee, and we had nice salads (favorite is the roasted beet and pistachio). Our 2nd time here and our new local favorite. Why wait an hour at Oreganos when you get great service and just as good of food at a local place?"}
{"text":"Very fun, friendly, comfortable atmosphere. Great food for breakfast, lunch or dinner.  Excellent outdoor patio that is dog friendly. I am not a coffee drinker but I hear it is very,very good. Plus fun activities during the week like drink and draw and trivia night."}
{"text":"Great food (Sriracha Turkey Sandwich) is da bomb!  Great atmosphere (comfortable, clean, cozy)! Great Service (people who care if your there)!  Great ownership (I usually see at least one there always)!  Plus, I can pick up new mountain biking gear and check out the new bikes for sale (a bike shop is connected)!  I'll bet you'll love it too!"}
{"text":"Eclectic fun environment to knit, hang w friends and yummy food! Great for families/friends and kids too."}
{"text":"Great food, atmosphere, and service. If you're going for breakfast, I highly recommend the pancakes!"}
{"text":"One of my favorite places in Cave Creek. Very comfortable atmosphere, excellent food and friendly service. Indoor and outdoor seating!"}
{"text":"There gluten free burger was tasty! I choose with out the gf bread and went with the lettuce. I wish they would have a gluten free option beer or cider though. The atmosphere was nice the waiters/bartender/barista where so sweet and helpful. I can see coming back and listening to the live music on the weekend for a relaxing evening! The burger was a little up there in price paying 10 dollars for a piece of meet with out a pretzel bun or gluten free bun and with out a side is a little much but the coffee was amazing and the iced vanilla chai tea was also tasty !!"}
{"text":"Best breakfast I've had in years! Oatmeal with roasted red pepper eggs and avocado? Who would thought that would good? Absolutely delicious! Any place that has a guitar hanging on the wall for budding guitarist has a special place in my heart!!"}
{"text":"Great coffee, friendly and welcoming staff and fabulous coffee drinks.Wish them lots of success. Glad to know there is a new coffeehouse, breakfast and lunch place in the area. Love the latte art on the coffee drinks ! Good job Lauren !  Also had their tuna salad sandwich and tasted very fresh. It was a big sandwich so  wrapped the rest to eat it later at home and it was my dinner!  Bottomline..Love the look of the place and the staff could not be friendlier."}
{"text":"Another great experience at Local Jonny's.  Cilantro chicken salad with lemon vinaigrette.  Awesome environment for a relaxing lunch during an otherwise crazy work day!"}
{"text":"I had the great pleasure of stopping in at Local Jonny's, for my first time, yesterday - [us] dirty and smelly from a fun all day hike in the heat. Starving, but not wanting to \"spoil our appetites\" for dinnertime around the corner, my mom and I settled on \"The 'Burger'\" to share (read: to stuff our faces with). It's vegetarian (which suits me well!); made in-house, the black bean patty comes with a chipotle aioli sauce, lettuce, tomato, and I think even feta and avocado, on a ciabatta bun ($9). A nice light salad and a little chocolate chip cookie came on the side of a cute presentation with a steel pizza pan, covered in parchment(-type) paper. It was really delicious. I've made and eaten my share of veggie burgers (served scratch-made three kinds on a food business I had years back), and really loved this one. There was something tangy, with a nice spice, which offered a bright flavor in and around the patty. The ciabatta seemed fresh and nice and chewy, and worked well with the rest of it (not too big or too bready to dominate). I even liked the dressing on the salad (and usually am super picky about any dressing with, but especially on, a salad) - it was a sweet and a little sour... something (maybe a kind of honey mustard?). The plate was clean in moments, letting us enjoy the drinks we ordered and the great setting. Jon made a great recommendation to my wine-drinking mom who was craving a beer after hours on the trail - she was very happy with the SanTan SunSpot. I had a decaf Americano w/ soy that was really tasty - ordering Americanos can be risky, as they often come overly diluted and lose the flavor of the coffee; asking for a milk to be added can mean you get milk with a bit of coffee, or some kind of curdled mess (for nondairy milks...). This was great strong coffee flavor (which, if you have to drink decaf, you often have to settle for medium- or light-bodied flavors, which is less fun), nice complement with a bit of the milk, and even the offer to remake if not to my liking. We interacted with four staff members, all of whom were beyond pleasant, making the experience warm, as comfy as your own dinner party might be, and totally appealing all around. Looking forward to trying Local Jonny's again soon for other lunch, and definitely breakfast or dinner items - I hear the live music acts are great, too!"}
{"text":"This is our favorite spot in Cave Creek! The coffee is fabulous, and their breakfast is always on point. You have GOT to order the pancakes...a delicious granola crunch smothered with a berry compote, those bad boys don't even need syrup! We love sitting out on the patio on the high top tables with our kids watching the cars and bikes roll through Cave Creek while chatting with other patrons. The atmosphere is great, and the owners are awesome!"}
{"text":"Im still in limbo on this. I have only gone twice. First time, got a vanilla iced chai, and it was great! Second time, had to wait in line, no problem. The cashier def looked like she had better places to be. A lady behind me kept inching up on me and I could \"feel\" that she was in a hurry. So my turn comes up, and the blonde barista girl calls the lady behind me up and skips me. Hmmm, not that cool. Anyways, I order an iced dirty chai and then wait to pay. The woman who was allowed to cut in front of me was trying to pay for her two drinks with cash and the cashier didnt have enough cash in her drawer, so she was asking the male owner to get her change. Cashier then looked at me and  said, \"youre not paying cash, are you?\". I said \"no, I could pay by card.\" And my drink came just under $7 dollars! I was surprised that a smaller version of my Starbucks favorite, was actually MORE than Starbucks- heck at least I get a \"star\" for my drinks from Starbucks. So I may try this place once more and see how that weighs in. As for making a dirty chai- wasnt impressed and threw it away before I was even halfway done. Epsresso was just too bitter. I havent tried their food yet, but have heard and read some good things"}
{"text":"What a great find!  Stopped before heading out for a hike at Cave Creek Regional Park, so glad I did! Super friendly staff, great menu with unique items.  Had coffee and the Savory Oatmeal - both were awesome! I will happily make the drive back up here from East Mesa just to eat here again. Great town as well,  a lot of interesting shops."}
{"text":"Cave Creek is a small, adult party town. Within a half a mile from Jonny's you could watch Long Horn cows being ridden, rub elbows with Veterans at the American Legion, join in the rivalry at the Steelers bar or rub elbows at the Harley motorcycle bar. All around Jonny's is the makings of a western town with all kinds of novelty shops. Jonny's is a cafe nicely done and located inside a Bicycle shop. I had a delightful egg sandwich with avocado around three in the afternoon. They have wonderful coffee and alcohol selections to go with your meal. This cafe reminds me of a cafe at the beach where everyone goes to come in out of the sun and enjoy a nice meal in a pleasant atmosphere. The service is fast and friendly. I now know why most people love this place. If you have a happy heart, come check this place out, you will walk out smiling."}
{"text":"Wow. A hidden gem. Went for a beer and then came back for breakfast. BREAKFAST!! Go there and eat everything. We got the famous pancakes and the traditional breakfast. Everything was delicious and on point. My husband loved the kombucha and I'm still savoring the coffee as I type this. Beer selection is great and the staff couldn't be any nicer. I'm sure it goes without saying that we will come back here every chance we get. Nom nom nom."}
{"text":"The Stars Wars breakfast at Denny's will have to wait...  Jedi-Johnnies!? A lot of interesting characters here but not quite in as far out a way as the original cantina scene. Kind of like most of Cave Creek...it's nice to see the locals and tourists - bikers, cyclists, muscle car drivers, luxury vehicle drivers, drivers of old Rovers and new Jeeps...you get my point. The parking lot is a \"what's what\" of interesting modes of transportation and you'll see it all if you sit on the front porch which is just dandy until someone comes along, plops down next to you and starts kicking the foot-rail. This of course is felt by adjoining tables and it's annoying.    The food!! It's delicious. Generous portions. Interesting flavor combos. LOVE the savory oatmeal and the hearty fruit pancake. I was delighted last visit with my Mexican hot chocolate. (This is how we almost had happened to go to the other direction Denny's over by I-17 - jonesin' for that hot chocolate.) Prices are fair. You order at the counter, get a number and food is brought to the table. You have to self-serve back to counter for coffee refills and this is the kink.   The queue inside gets a little messy - customers who want coffee refills kind of pushing ahead you when you're standing in line to place your order. It'd be nice if they have a separate line for this during the peak hours. (My Utopian life.) Or if in fact, other customers were more courteous and just waited their turn. Not sure which is asking more - the separate line or for people to just ChillTFOut. But hey, this is the cantina scene, right? Takes all types.    Oh! and sometimes, there is a band of musicians. Haven't been here in awhile for drinks/dinner but definitely worth a go if you're inclined."}
{"text":"Awesome coffee, cool environment! I ordered an americano that was really good. I pulled off the lid to put in cream and it was so nice and frothy that I could t even bring myself to do it. We sat on the outdoor patio and it was a perfect way to start our Sunday morning. If I had one qualm it would be that the service was just ok, but what can you expect from a hipster establishment. Go check it out!"}
{"text":"Local Jonnys is a favorite here in cave creek! I stop in weekly for a almond milk latte. Never disappoints and is always just what I need to get my through my work day. The staff always greets you with a smile and makes you feel welcome which I really appreciate as well. Food wise I love the veggie bean wrap! It's huge so I usually split it between 2 meals. Hold back if you don't like spicy though, it definitely has a little kick. The kale pesto flat bread is really yummy as well. 5 stars from me! Well done Jonny (and lauren)"}
{"text":"Had their Southwest Sunrise sandwich the other day!  Phenomenal!  Will definitely be back to try the famous pancakes we heard about!"}
{"text":"Great beer selection. Great owners.  Great staff. Love the Sriracha turkey sandwich.  A great place with great people and great food. Take a trip to cave Creek"}
{"text":"One of my favorite spots up in cave creek. The coffee is amazing. My go to is the breakfast sandwich with ham and it is so tasty and pretty big. The staff is always so welcoming and the atmosphere is great. They also have mimosas in a van which is a pretty fun treat"}
{"text":"Wow! It's almost impossible for me to find a good breakfast place that also has good coffee. This place is it! Both breakfast and coffee was spot on. As you walk in, you are greeted by a tray of pastries filled with free samples. It's not tiny pieces either. The muffins were quartered and given out as samples. It looked delicious, but I wanted to save my appetite for my breakfast.  You order at the counter and go sit and they do the rest. I ordered a breakfast sandwich and my friend ordered a Flat Tire breakfast (breakfast burrito). My sandwich which was made with English muffin was amazing. It was tasty without feeling greasy and the English muffin was perfectly toasted. The side of wedged fries came out very hot and paired nicely with the sandwich. The breakfast burrito was tasty as well. It was perfect with salsa that it came with. The portion sizes were big too; we both had leftovers.  Did I mention the coffee? They have full selection of coffees. They had Irish coffee but I will have to get that next time as it contains alcohol :).  The restaurant was very clean and cozy. The staff was friendly and they also offer bags of coffee beans and souvenirs for sale. This is my new spot for good breakfast. I'm so happy I tried it today ."}
{"text":"five stars all around!   5 stars for food. 5 stars for atmosphere. 5 star for drinks. 5 stars for service.   so happy Yelp directed me to Local Jonny's while visiting Cave Creek for the weekend. I have been visiting AZ my whole life, however this was my first time to Local Jonny's. Came here for Sunday breakfast, and couldn't be more satisfied.   I ordered the veggie bean wrap, which was delicious. it goes great with a touch of hot sauce or salsa on the side. i also tried the southwest sunrise breakfast sandwich. It was SOOOOO GOOD. the egg was perfectly cooked, and the yolk juiced up the sandwich once bitten.   i would recommend trying the bloody mary--it comes with a pickle and olives--my 2 favs. also you can get a beer sampler on the side for a dollar more.   all in all great experience and will make this joint apart of all my future AZ visits."}
{"text":"First time visitor to Local Jonnys, long time AZ resident. We tried this restaurant for breakfast. Nice and clean. Not crowded. Not too impressed though. We had no idea how the place worked. No greeting when we walked in and fumbled around until we finally asked how to order. The coffee which is from Flagstaff was very weak. They need to add another scoop to the pot. Also, we had no idea if there were coffee refills because no one asked. Staff wasn't very friendly. The three chorizo breakfast tacos were bland and dry. If not for the pico, there would be no flavor. Sorry, had high expectations but we were let down."}
{"text":"Craft beer and coffee bar to satisfy two important needs in the Cave Creek area.  Very clean and sleek decor, open and airy, with friendly service from local folks.  Beans from Firecreek in Sedona, which deserves the good reputation it has as a roaster.  While enjoying your coffee you can observe the bike mechanics working in the adjacent and connected store, if you're voyeuristically inclined."}
{"text":"Yep!  Locals meeting 4 coffee.  Friendly staff, good breakfast burrito but had to add salsa to spice it up.  Good muffins.  Western vibe complete with \"open carry\".  My kind of place!"}
{"text":"If you're driving through Cave Creek you gotta stop here. Great beer selection, great coffee and a really cool setting. Wish we had this in Queen Creek."}
{"text":"What a great little surprise! My husband and I live in Cave Creek and on a whim decided to try this place fir breakfast. Neat atmosphere, friendly service, and great food. What makes the good great is half the quality of the ingredients (not just any old sourdough toast or English muffin) but also how it is cooked...how many places can you go to where your over medium egg is actually medium?  Or your toast is actually fully toasted (but not overdone)?  Sounds simple, but I'm a goody and I'm very impressed. We will be back for lunch and dinner!"}
{"text":"Absolutely delightful!!  Relaxed ambience. Breakfast was hot, fresh & yummy. Hubby had eggs, crispy bacon & blueberry pancakes. I had veggie burrito with fresh salsa. Generous portions.  Many thanks to Courtney who helped us during her first hour on the job. Special thanks to the manager who brought us a screwdriver on the house for our anniversary."}
{"text":"I tried Local Jonny's about 7 months ago for lunch, and the food was excellent.  While in Cave Creek again this evening, I made it a point to visit them with my wife and one of her friends. The dining experience on this occasion was, however, negative on 3 counts.    Count 1 - The food. The Veggie Bean Wrap I ordered was poor (i.e.the tortilla was dried out and the \"seasoned bean medley\" was significantly overcooked). The side orzo salad was equally unappealing and bland.  My wife and her friend ordered \"The Crunch\" and the \"Southwest Chicken Salad Wrap\" respectively.  Neither enjoyed or finished their meal.    Count 2 - The noise. The restaurant commenced a \"trivia contest\" as we sat waiting for our food to arrive.  In the contest, the customer who correctly answers the most trivia questions is apparently eligible for a free drink or some food.  During the contest, an individual (I'd guess to be the manager?) continuously circulated throughout the room repeating the same question (or story problem) to each table in a loud, animated voice.  There were 15 questions and 8 or 10 tables involved.  The contest was thus ongoing throughout our meal.  The noise made it hard to have a normal conversation, and hearing the same question repeated loudly 8 or 10 times was grating.    Count 3 - The tipping.  At Jonny's, there is apparently no table service (other than delivery of the food to your table).  You order at the bar and pay for the food in advance.  Their system also prompts you to tip at the time of payment; prior to knowing the food quality, service or overall experience.  In our case all 3 were substandard, but the tip was already in the system (very annoying).  Here's the good news - The ladies behind the bar were very pleasant and the sauvignon blanc was good.  This might well have been a good place having a very bad night, but I cannot imagine returning.  I can understand messing up the food (new chef, equipment failure, whatever . . . ), but the trivia contest was deliberate and it was unbearable."}
