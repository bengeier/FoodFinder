{"text":"Friendly staff, seems to be off the busy beat of downtown but refreshing change to the hustle. 
ordered grilled sardines as an appetizer, super good! Tomato basil soup was tasty but a bit thick for my  liking, chicken salad sammich was not for me. Too much mayo and the saltiness was unbearable. Not sure if it's  from the butter on the bread and or content of the chicken salad mix. Loved the beer selection,  they are committed to micro brewers  for sure. Gave them a 4 star because of staff, decor, not crazy busy location and decent food experience."}
{"text":"Excellent food, great service.

A wonderful social enterprise too!

The menu was very limited for vegetarians but what was available was amazing!

The quality of ingredients is palpable from the first bite.

They also serve some good Ontario wines from innovative wineries such as Southbrook.

The price reflects the quality, i.e., it is not too cheap.

It is also not open on Sunday, I believe.

Cannot wait to go back here next time I am in Toronto!"}
{"text":"Really excellent service and food. I had an eggplant dish that was EXCELLENT. My sister had a remix of a Big Mac that she really liked too. Funky inside--highly highly recommend! Good prices, too, and ethical practices."}
{"text":"Put together by Squarefood Design, Hawthorne seats as many as 42 diners, both in tables and at the bar.  The windows span from ceiling to floor all along the wall, casting light on the beautiful preserved mason jars that occupy various shelves throughout the room.  I know that this whole pickle-container thing is a little overplayed in restaurants right now, but I still really love the look. A far cry from the popular \"eclectic\" look most restaurants are going for, the light wood tables and chairs are a little IKEA-esque, but are surprisingly comfortable for sitting none-the-less. So, no, the Hawthorne may not be the most sexy of dining rooms, but even with the lights dimmed, it feels organic, cheerful and bright. It likely appeals more to the lunch crowd than to a romantic date night out, which is the only reason I can find for it being only half full on a Friday night.  
Having said that, unlike so many other \"hot\" spots in the city who sport the aforementioned sexy decor, the Hawthorne lends itself fairly well to a date night in other aspects of its atmosphere. The level of music in the room is at a moderate volume- just loud enough to catch a buzz, but not to distract one from an intimate conversation. And the tables (particularly the deuce booths we were sat in) seem spaced far enough apart that I don't have to worry someone's going to be listening in.  I also found the temperature quite nicely controlled- all the more reason to bust out a little sassy leg or maybe even a pre-mature shoulder-action, G-d forbid.
Complementing the comfortable setting, the service was pleasant and professional. Being stuck in the middle of the worst bout of allergies I have ever encountered to date (where I have practically lost my voice and choke after more than 10 words of talking), I really appreciated our adorable servers' attention to my water glass. The cutlery was also consistently replenished, and the whole meal moved at a comfortable and appropriate pace-in and hour in 1  1/2 hours.   While our server was certainly knowledgeable about the food and drink offerings, I appreciated that she brought in the bartender for some of our more detailed requests.  And let me tell you, that bartender knows her s*it. Just listening to her describe different bourbons' tasting notes made me wish I could just stay all night to drink, drink, drink- but sadly, we had choices to make.
At the Hawthorne one can choose from the all-Ontario beer list, a more globally inspired short wine selection (all $10-11/glass), and of course their housemade cocktails. The cocktail list was extensive and tempting, to say the least. Honestly, I hadn't eaten or drank a thing before I had decided I needed to return- there are just too many delicious and gorgeous concoctions waiting to reach my liver! But for those whose livers need a rest (and let's be honest, we all have those morning/afternoons/nights), the Hawthorne actually makes a solid effort to make staying sober sexy. Suddenly being the DD isn't such a burden anymore!  Here, they whip up a unique line up of classic sodas in house using only natural ingredients (that's right folks, no high fructose corn syrup here). Well, as you know, we are drinkers ourselves so over the course of the night opted for.

Twist of Faith (Devils Cut Bourbon, Averna, St. Germain Elderflower, Orange Twist, $12)
All booze, yet remarkably smooth and balanced. Totally his kind of drink.

Just Pluck'd (Vodka, St. Germain Elderflower, House Pear Cardamom Syrup, Rosemary, $10)

{"text":"Walking in I was greeted by a young man whom sat me at the bar for my meal. Overall the place looks a little like its trying too hard to be something instead of just being. There is a uncomfortable atmosphere and no tv to watch behind the bar while you wait for your meal. It was almost empty besides two others sitting at the bar eating also which I found odd for 7pm in a Saturday night.

I asked what they would recommend that night and they suggested the pork belly, which I was excited to try. I watched the cook start cooking and globed in a yellow gelatinous substance with the beans which made me a bit wary of my meal. It was presented to me in a large bowl with the fat side lightly torched. 

I began eating and the flavor a were ok, it was very, very rich a bit too much and that gelatinous broth the cook used was almost too much to handle. I finished up, paid and left. 

I took a long walk on Younge and about a hour after my meal my stomach started turning, enough to make me cut my night short and go back to my hotel. It was there that I started throwing up and the oil that came up coated the toilet and I had to flush it many times for it to actually go down. I know that might be a bit much to hear in a review but I was sick the entire night from this meal and it ruined my whole and last night in Toronto.

I won't be back to this place ever but there are soo many other options in this great city that it won't be a problem."}
{"text":"Go for the Four Square meal--it changes every day according to the chef's whims and is a great way to get a sampling of what the place is capable of.  The box looks small, but even though there's not a lot of each item, there's a lot of food as a whole.  It's very reasonably priced for such a great selection, too.

Service was fast and friendly and the new space looks great.  Definitely worth a return visit."}
{"text":"I went to the Hawthorne last night for dinner with my partner. We got there pretty late, just under an hour to closing. It's got that trendy, wooden toned and simple look that's popular these days, but what can I say, I like it.
I tried the Strawberry soda, which was really delicious and came in an adorable glass boot. We had an appetiser of the Lemongrass Ribs and OMG if that isn't one of the best prepared ribs I've had in Toronto.
My partner had the roast chicken, which came as an entire half chicken within a roasting pot (along with the associated sides). I had the tilapia, which is branching out as I have never ordered fish at a restaurant outside of salmon sushi. I really enjoyed the dish, and the sides complimented it perfectly, practically a masterpiece of flavours.
Why not 5 stars? Service was friendly, but a bit problematic. Our drinks came out with the appetiser. We had just taken our first bites of the appetiser when the waiter cleared our plates from under us and apologetically brought our mains, which rushed me through the ribs for fear of my food going cold. Now maybe this had something to do with the late hour, but it either was a kitchen mess up or rushing us out the door, and we still left before anyone else seated in the restaurant left their tables. With only 2 other tables filled, I really feel that this wasn't, and shouldn't be, an error.
The second irritation was that I had shown the yelp \"free soda\" to the waiter and he acknowledged it, but still put the soda on the bill, which is fine because the soda's worth the money.
Overall the quality of the food redeemed these issues for me, but I go out for food and not for service. The price is right for the food, but the service lost some of its value for me."}
{"text":"One of my local favorites. The food is beautiful and always tasty and fresh. The staff are lovely and extremely attentive. As a plus this place operates as a social enterprise. Eat well and feel good doing it. Win win."}
{"text":"What, Hawthorne? How can you let me down so? 

Here is the backgrounder on the relationship between Hawthorne and me: Hawthorne sits on my hood, so when I walk by, I was always like \"sup, H, looking cute today\" and checking out its pretty d√©cor. Then Yelp holds an elite event there and I was so excited to be invited to get to know lil H! It pleasantly impressed me with fun drinks, nice bartenders and neat treats. So then I, being all for social enterprises, fresh food, and supportive work training, decided that I'll host a birthday dinner there for 15 peeps, show my friends what's good, and expand Hawthorne's good work and food to my spheres of influence! 

Great idea right? 

The manager of Hawthorne thought so, and was very on top of calling me multiple times to make sure my party was a go! So. Then. Why: why was the manager whom I talked to numerous times over the week of planning not there to at least acknowledge or greet the party? Why was the atmosphere so hostile? Why did it feel like the servers did not care to serve such a large party?  I understand service sometimes suffers in exchange for job training, but this was not so much about the technicalities of service (I don't need to be refilled water every 5 minutes! and I don't even mind waiting a bit for my food!). What really made me sad was the underwhelming and unfriendly atmosphere, especially with the advanced promise from making a big reservation with them.

My friends were not impressed at all with the service nor the food. So my great idea to put Hawthorne on the forefront failed and it was, unfortunately, a truly less-than-mediocre birthday dinner celebration. I was so disappointed because I had built such a strong, positive initial rapport with Hawthorne. 

Atmosphere - 5/5 (the d√©cor is lovely)
Service - 2/5
Food - 2/5
Price - 2/5"}
{"text":"Literally a 5 minute walk from the Eaton Centre, Hawthorne is the sole restaurant on Richmond E among all the new condos being erected. It is the sister restaurant of Fabarnak on Church and, similarly, is run by a community kitchen staff.

Our meal started with the Smoked Salmon Cakes. Their portion was rather on the skimpy side, but the flavour profile was spot on. The cakes were coated in crispy Panko and were creamy and rich on the inside. The sauce Gribiche that accompanied it was speckled with chopped capers and had the perfect acidic zing.

I had the ribs as my main, and unfortunately they were tough. While some pieces fell off the bone, they were still leathery. No matter how much I chewed, I felt like there was an opportunity for it to get stuck in my throat :| The accompanying sides were very bland. No seasoning at all. 

We got the fries as a side and they were pretty rock on. I really enjoyed the malt vinegar aioli that they provided for dipping.

Overall an okay experience."}
{"text":"Overall, I had a great experience. I had made a reservation for 8, and the table was ready on time. I went on a week night at 08:30 and not many tables were occupied. As we sat through the night, the tables started filling up, many for drinks and dessert. The service was great, the waiters were friendly and followed-up in a timely manner. My water glass was never empty. My friends ordered a bottle of white wine, which they described the wine list as \"pretty affordable\". The cocktails were good as well.

In terms of food, I would have to say it was inconsistent. The appetizers were spot on! The fishy and chips, as well as the quail was delicious. The mains was where the problem was. I orders a half roasted chicken, and the meat was so pink and raw that I could squeeze a bit of blood from the leg. My friend ordered the dunk, and it was a big underdone as well. The Arctic Char was very salty. The pork belly was tender and delicious though. For dessert, my friend and I ordered the chocolate torte, which was AMAZING. The toffee sauce on the torte was divine. 

I will most likely go back to Hawthorne, but only for appetizers, drinks, and desserts. It is a quiet and warm atmosphere, perfect for date night or girls-night-out!"}
{"text":"Hawthorne TO is the newest restaurant from Chef Eric Wood, formerly of the ever-popular Fabarnak http://www.yelp.ca/biz/fabarnak-restaurant-and-catering-toronto#hrid:nJfEiH26IWnXMy68_s0rKA. As anyone who has ventured to Fabarnak knows that Chef Wood's fare is thoughtful, creative and draws inspiration from around the Globe. 

Hawthorne TO, further south along church at Richmond, is all that Fabarnak was and then some. Wood's classic interpretation on the Bento has followed him to Hawthorne, as the \"four square lunch\" - a TREMENDOUS value'd tasting meal at $16. While everything I have tried has been outstanding, the true standouts are the wok-fried edamame and the Lemongrass, Nam-Pla Ribs which might get my vote as the most intelligent and delicious dish of the YEAR. Without exaggeration - I have never seen anything like it.

Chef Wood's focus is on social change initiatives, as well as presenting local and truly inspired foods. As a chef he is completely underrated, and one of the best in the city, no contest. Hawthorne TO is fairly priced and completely worth the trip. Be sure to check out their house-made sodas for a special treat.

Open now for lunch, open for dinner in the new year. This place will get popular FAST so get in while you can. 

Five, very enthusiastic stars."}
{"text":"The restaurant is very small, at first we were not sure we were in the right place. It is run by a community kitchen staff.. The server/host was very nice and attentive. Service was very good

The food is very delicious! Fresh ingredients and well prepared but portions are very very small!! Main dishes (average of $14) don't come with a side ($6) so I ordered the brisket and tongue dip with seasonal veggies. The sandwich was a bit dry without dipping it in the au jus, but it has a pleasant strong meaty flavor. The seasonal veggie was a garlic steamed baby bok choy. It was light and delicate, perfect paring with my brisket. Unfortunately it was just ONE bok choy

My fiancee ordered the fried chicken, it was perfectly seasoned and very moist and tender, unfortunately (again) the portion was very small. We also shared the fries and they were pretty rock on. The malt vinegar aioli was fantastic.

Given the price and the portion sizes it was an okay experience but I may go back again."}
{"text":"I love this place. I highly recommend the negroni, any burger, anything with potatoes. Nice and small, quick and friendly, ever evolving menu. Great for a business lunch or a date with the one you love. I heard that Hawthorne also sources their staff from orgs that are trying to help people get on their feet again so I definitely appreciate that."}
{"text":"Very good service and attention by the staff ... But the food makes or break the evening ... Well Hawthrone's failed in our books ... The food was simply not good at all ... Actually one member in our group had a less than desirable experience having to lay down at home with a terribly sore belly.  

There is no common theme or direction in the cuisine's tastes or composition.  It is truly all over the place ... Simple items like fries seem to have originated from a \"greasy spoon\" not a up-scale establishment ... 

Unique tastes are good but completely \"off the wall\" TASTES ALWAYS does not make for an enjoyable experience especially when paying a little more than the norm.  And what was that \"stale tasting\" sampler when we left?"}
{"text":"My wife and I came here on a quiet Wednesday evening, which I couldn't believe because they have half-off bottles of wine on wednesdays. The atmosphere in a booth was nice and you could see the whole restaurant and the kitchen from where i was sitting. We got a bottle of the cabernet franc and thought it was just ok.

For food, I ordered their special salad, asparagus spears with hen of the woods mushrooms and monforte tomme cheese and shallot vinaigrette and my wife had the chickpea and fennel soup. The salad was very pleasant, the soup was a little spicy and lacked a creaminess that I'd expect from a blended soup.

For mains, I had the ricotta gnocchi with wild mushrooms and arugula and the special vegetable of the day, fiddleheads in ramp butter. My wife had the buttermilk fried chicken with a slaw salad. While I was expecting traditional-looking gnocchi, what I got was 7-8 3 centimeter rolls of gnocchi dough filled with ricotta cheese. It was simple and delicious. The fiddleheads were the same - very pleasant. My wife liked the chicken but was a little concerned about some redness inside. I assured her it was ok, but didn't say that I thought it was probably because the chicken wasn't cooked super fresh (I imagine they pre-cook the chicken before they batter and fry the chicken).

Overall, the meal was super fresh (with the potential exception of the chicken) and the flavors were very clean and identifiable. I liked that the food wasn't covered in thick , creamy flavors and that after all that food, we had enough room to have an order of the chocolate bread-pudding with butterscotch ice cream. The pudding was a bit sweeter than I'd normally like, but that's more so that I don't feel like such a glutton for enjoying such a rich dessert.

We enjoyed everything and would come again should we ever happen upon Toronto again."}
{"text":"Being a huge fan of Fabarnak, I had wanted to check out Hawthorne Food and Drink and had high hopes. (Note: Chef Eric Wood is no longer there)

I went with 3 other friends and each of our meals were underwhelming in terms of the actual taste of the food. The presentation however, was really nice and made the food look better than it tasted.

Although none of our dishes were \"bad\" they were not great either, nothing more than average. (Hence, the 3 stars) I got the duck and it was too peppery, salty and chewy. I don't have much else to say about it...

I also got a glass of white wine sangria and that was really good. It was light with a slice of lime and grapefruit inside. The chilled wine glass was also a nice touch.

Overall, the meal was unmemorable aside from the company and I will not be returning."}
{"text":"Being a fan of Fabarnak, I wanted to check out what Chef Eric Wood was offering at Hawthorne.  

I think it's great that Hawthorne is involved with the community through it's association with HWTC promoting workforce training.  

It's one of those places where the food is good and you feel good eating here.
The menu is crafted with fresh local ingredients in mind, supporting local Ontario farmers.   

The restaurant is about a 5 minute walk east from the Eaton center.
We came here on a Sunday evening for dinner and it was pretty quiet.  
There were a few tables of tourists and groups.

The decor was simple, warm, and comfortable.
I liked the two seater booths, the noise level was good so that we could chat without shouting. 

The Yelp special for a free soda did not pop up on my phone when I checked in (sadface).  The server we had was newer and he did not know about the special.
That's okay, I ordered a beer, they had a decent list.

There was a fixed price menu available for the evening which was a good deal and it included wine!  However, I wanted to try the fried chicken that was not on the menu, so we ordered a la carte.

To start I had the roast squash salad ($9) with apple, kale, and a curry dressing.  It was more squash than kale and the curry sauce had a little kick and complimented the sweet squash.

The smoked salmon cakes ($8) were light and tasty.
There were two small cakes that were perfectly crispy but I found them slightly bland.

For my main, I was tempted by the buttermilk fried chicken ($13).
When the chicken arrived, I thought the plate looked sparse. 
The chicken served was wing and thigh and a small portion.
The slaw served with the chicken was asian vinaigrette dressed... 
and I didn't love it.

Now, I really liked the french fries ($6) which made up for the slaw.
Thyme, malt vinegar, and aioli.. OMG, so crispy and delicious.

Overall,the food is good and our meal was pleasant.
I'd come back for lunch, I want to try one of these four-square meals mentioned by others. :)"}
{"text":"10/10 great food, great service, and great cause for the community & environment! Plus the bathrooms were clean and stylish which seals the deal"}
{"text":"Lunch Menu - I highly recommend the Lambton Beets! The service was great, and the restaurant has large windows which means beautiful lighting and lots to window watch while awaiting your meal. 

Lambton Beets 
6oz Ontario Wellington County Strip 
Double Chocolate Cake 


6oz Ontario Wellington County Strip ($MP-3.5/5) 

This medium rare steak is served with potatoes and seasonal vegetables. The steak was pretty good, but nothing amazing. However the frites were pretty good and tasted very fresh! 


Lambton Beets  - ($16+7 - 5/5) 

Though I am generally not a beets fan, but this fish was my faaavourite dish! This dish included roasted beets, baked squash, malted wheat berries served with cranberry sauce. I made the salad a main by adding the smoked chicken (+$7)and it was very smoky, tasted like little bits of shawarma heaven added on. This definitely made the appetizer more like a meal size.  The squash melted in your mouth, beets were seasoned nicely. Cranberry sauce was thick and consistent and it added to the dish very well. The malted wheat berries really made the dish. I HIGHLY recommend ordering this with the add on. 


Double Chocolate Cake - ($9 - 3.5/5) 

This slice consist of layers of dark chocolate ganache, buttercream, wafer, strawberry & pineapple bits. This hit the spot, especially with the chocolate ganache that spilled with every cut. It has just the right amount of chocolate. Plating presentation was amazing. 

Hawthorne practices Farm-to-Fork by using local, seasonal and sustainable ingredients, which is always appreciated. Hawthorne also provides free training and career deceleration for people in need of skills and employment, which is great because giving back to a community is just as important! ???

{"text":"Have been wanting to try Hawthorne for a while, and Summerlicious provided the opportunity for a work lunch with the girls. The service was a little spotty, but when we advised the waitress they took all pains to rectify and speed up service to ensure we'd be done in a regular lunch hour. The food was delicious, and for Summerlicious it was the cheaper option, and reasonably portioned. Looking forward to going back."}
{"text":"Neat and clean restaurant. Food is ok went there for dinner and ordered couple of items, one of the items never showed up. The order was for spicy food however the food was not spicy, but was good so did not complaint. The waitress however recognized the mistake came over and insisted on getting the food corrected which was nice if her. Spicy food in this restaurant is not good. All they do is add more hot sauce and make the food really not without proper seasoning. 
Overall ok food."}
{"text":"Disappointed in the summerlicious menu. 

The Mexican corn and grilled peach appetizer caught my eye immediately - but had no flavour and used canned peaches. The ball park dog had a delicious mustard, but was otherwise nothing special. 

We had the steak and chicken shmaltz carbonara as mains - both good, but again, nothing special. 

Dessert was the beet cheesecake, and although the I wouldn't describe it as a cheesecake, it wasn't bad. The cheese plate was probably the highlight - which says something given that it's not even really made by the chef. 

Service was poor - drinks arrived after 30 minutes, already 10 minutes into the main course. I think they were training new waiters as they kept coming to the table and trying to take plates at inappropriate times. Not heading back anytime soon!"}
{"text":"What a delightful experience here this evening!  First of all, the welcome is warm and sincere.  A good start.  

The menu offers interesting choices, and pushes the envelope, but is never weird.  It's quite meat-heavy, as another reviewer pointed out, but is not in the same realm as all the nose-to-tail dining so prevalent in Toronto as of late.

Appetizers were delicious: the fried smelts with chips were done to perfection, as were the quail.  I also enjoyed the ribs.   Mains were very solid as well; the most interesting and successful of which was the scallop ceviche on one dining companion's \"four square.\"  My arctic char was expertly seared, though I question the accompaniment of the onion compote (just an observation, not a criticism).  I tasted my other dining companion's beef cheeks, and found them meltingly tender.  A very judicious use of spicing throughout.

I also give my highest compliments to the service.  The waiter was friendly and knowledgeable, attentive but never hovering.  Though the pace between courses was perhaps a bit slower than in other places, this is largely due to the fact that the food is genuinely cooked from scratch (no pre-mixed salad from a bag here or characterless steamed vegetables).   I liked the wine that he recommended, a lovely Gamay from BC that complemented the slight spice in the food.

Creative, delicious desserts; the panna cotta was not overly sweet and was flavoured with lime leaf (one of my favourite aromatics).  

I praise the attention to detail that I found everywhere. 

The lone drawback was the coffee, which was bitter.  But hey, we can't all be perfect!  And some may find the music slightly loud (but they were playing 80s music, which I happen to love -- just my own personal taste -- so I can't complain).

 I'll definitely return."}
{"text":"My first stop at Winterlicious was Hawthorne Food & Drink. They provide free training for those unemployed youth and those receiving Ontario Disability Supports for free! They help people get the skills they need to land work. Amazing! I did not know this until I got there and my Chef Aunt educated me on it. A cozy spot with an organic feel serving up local eats and the good they do makes it taste even better! 

We started with the Daily Croquette. It was a mashed potato croquette sprinkled with old cheddar. Wow. They don't mess around! The potato was pureed smooth and the coating was perfectly crisp.  

For the entr√©e, I went with the Carbonara and my Aunt chose the Jerk Pork. I smoked chicken and crispy chicken skin were the highlights of my dish; I found the sauce a little salty, but the pasta was cooked perfectly. My Aunt could not say enough good things about the Jerk Pork. It was deconstructed and delicious.  

Dessert time! My Chef Aunt chose the Winter Vegetable Cheesecake and I picked the Portuguese Egg Tart. The Cheesecake was really interesting. I was trying to figure out what the vegetables were and I was terrible at it! When my Aunt told me what they were, I got it, but I definitely failed that test! My tart was deconstructed. I wish I'd had the original tart before, so I'd have something to compare it to. It was alright. Pastry was nice and flaky. 

The service was great. Knowledgeable and personable. Plates were cleared quickly and water glasses kept full. They also had a great local wine selection.  Not bad for $28!"}
{"text":"Checked this restaurant out during Summerlicious 2015. I would have liked to see what the 'usual' fare is but they only had the Summerlicious menu going. I went with a friend of mine so we were able to try two apps, entrees and desserts. I thought the lamb gyro had some really good flavours and while the chicken skin tacos were a good concept, the execution just wasn't right. The ribs were really good especially with the kozlicks mustard rub - will have to try that at home! I really enjoyed the aged cheddar ice cream with popcorn. Never thought it would taste good but now I'm adding popcorn to all my ice cream. The dinner was $25 fixed price. 
The food was okay but I think I'd stop by to try their regular menu to see if it's any different."}
{"text":"One of my favourite restaurants anywhere! In a very selfish way I'm glad to see so many negative reviews and this should keep away those that can't appreciate a good thing. 

Everything here is topnotch! Gary (host/server/drink maker) is super nice and extremely efficient. He's easy going and funny too. On my last three visits I had Rick (or was it Ricky? I'm terrible with names!) as the chef and he prepared some of the best burgers I've ever had... Ever!!! The steak & frites is delicious. The chicken sandwich? You got it: phenomenal! Desserts to die for! 

The restaurant has a decent price for the quality of the food and the restaurant decoration is simple yet sophisticated. The floor to ceiling windows let in some amazing natural light. 

Fantastic! Definitely a place that everyone should try!"}
{"text":"I was excited to try Hawthorne based on their mission to train hospitality workers. Happy to support a restaurant with a social purpose.

I was disappointed by the food though: the food was mediocre (lemongrass ribs were fatty and the sauce not particularly tasty) and the portions were incredibly small. 

The cocktails stood out as the best part of the night, but pricey ($12). 

I am happy that I came once to try it out and support the hospitality workers training centre. But the food is underwhelming an not good enough for what they are charging, and I wouldn't go back again."}
{"text":"Stopped by for the Summerlicious '16 menu and will definitely be coming back. Unfortunately, next time I'll have to be kind of annoying/high maintenance and ask the kitchen to use about a quarter of the oil/butter they made my meal in. Still feeling that amount of oil and/or butter sittin' in my tummy. If you're sensitive to that kind of cooking, it might be tough here (or any other gastropub, actually). 

THAT ASIDE, I'll be back because: 

1) Hawthorne has a very ethical backbone. They offer free training for those looking for employment but don't have the skills just yet to get there. And don't think this compromises the service - our server was dropping knowledge on every single dish in front of us (she even knew how they prepared each item) and my water was perpetually full (always a big up).

2) Elegant & casual feel to the place. I'd say it's the perfect spot to dress up a bit, or not, and get some great food on a night where you want to spend just a bit above average on dinner.

3) Save for the excess oil, great grub (yay using words just for that alliteration)."}

{"text":"Best place to work for free forever!

It is sad to see how they take advantage of people eager to work, grow and learn but they do not know where to start looking for jobs as they are starting to adapt their lives in Toronto or have special needs.

I worked for them in 2016 for 3 months full time, spent all my savings paying for transportation, uniforms and lunches.

I heard from the second week of the course that I was \"so ready and prepared to work\" as well as promises of help to start working with hotels and recognized companies and that never happened.

I was only offered to work full time for free. In 3 months of work I only covered about 5 paid food events where we were not offered food or drinks and the payment was minimum wage. But I worked 8 hours, 5 days a week in Hawthorne without receiving any payment, without right to eat anything, and with a break of 15 min maximum. Pops where the only thing we could consume freely.

After some weeks of training they believed I was capable enough for me to open or close the restaurant by myself. I did it. For several hours I was in charge of the whole restaurant by myself with 1 or 2 cooks until the trainer or another trainee came. So I was managing the whole front house by myself and not getting paid, or offered food and breaks longer than 15 minutes.

I met people with quick learning skills, and at some point all those people were very disappointed with the course. Some of them did not continue the course, others like me, we had already lost so much that we had no choice but to stay and wait to see if at any moment the promises came true.

After several months of my experience with this company, I got a job in a restaurant (without the help of is company) and the reality is completely different from what they do in Hawthorne. I get all the food I want to eat for just $4 per day. I get paid tips plus a salary. The training was just 3 days and it was paid. The break is 30 min every 5 hours of work, one hour every 8 hours.

I did 2 courses with this company. Front of house and Guest services. I regret so much doing both courses. I would never get that time of my life back again.

This is all my personal opinion and experience and I wanted to post it so people are aware of it before starting losing their time.

If you are new in Toronto and thinking about starting one of this courses because you feel lost about where to start finding jobs in Toronto, send me a message. I'm not an expert, but I can give you my opinion on the matter and maybe make your life a bit easier."}
{"text":"Friendly staff, inviting ambiance. Ordered the shrimp linguine off their lunch mention; large portions which actually included a good number of jumbo sized shrimps. Got to enjoy a glass of their PEI Riesling. Love their good deeds in how they serve their community! Would definitely come back."}
{"text":"Portions are of a regular size, so not huge but just right, with good flavour.  I had the Charred Romaine Heart, which would have been perfect if the egg was actually warm.  It was a bit weird feeling the coolness of the yolk.  If they could warm it up a little bit, it would go well with the warmth of the romaine.  I had the buttermilk fried chicken which was very tasty.  The eggnog cheesecake was delicious!  My friend had the chicken liver creme caramel which was pretty good too."}
{"text":"My girlfriend suggested this spot for its local inspired dishes and the social enterprise nature of the restaurant. They provide free training for those who need skills to enter the hospitality workforce. 

Now on to the food. I had a pasta dish with smoked chicken (which seems to be popular among a number of menu items. My GF had salad with a maple salmon. Both well done and reasonably priced. Both were good. 

I'd go back to try their burger and fries, which looked excellent. 

And while it's a small thing, it's worth noting that the washrooms were immaculate for an establishment that seemed short staffed."}
{"text":"The food here is amazing. Really yummy and unique! It was a quiet place so good for when you want to converse. 

I definitely want to go here again. Especially since the menu changes all the time with new options."}
{"text":"Hawthorne refers to an English hedge plant which has large sharp thorns.  The only thing sharp here is Chef Wood's cleaver that he uses to debone a duck!

The restaurant has officially opened for lunch but hopes to be open during the holidays for brunch.  Full dinner service is expected to be full swing in January.

The decor is very Jamie Kennedy with all sorts of preserved goodies lining the walls.  Apart from being a kitchen, chef Eric Wood hopes to make this a training ground for aspiring chefs and servers alike.  

For drinks you can opt for housemade soda served in cute boot-shaped glasses, a selection of craft beers or a generous glass of wine.

We started with a plate of Edamame with ponzu molasses, chilli and peanuts.  While I felt they were a tad overcooked, the flavours were amazing.  

We then moved on to the Fish 'n Chips (fried smelts with Kennebec frites, MALT VINEGAR DUST that I would snort if nobody was looking - it was THAT good), tartar sauce and ketchup.  

There ain't no fried chicken here, but there is fried quail in a buttermilk batter drizzled in honey.  Not as crispy as fried chicken, but definitely tender and more delicate.

The signature 4SquareMeal ($16), imported from Chef Wood's square pegs in his Fabarnak days see the same format.  Think jazzed up bento box.  Today's selection included:

Whole Grains Salad with Squash and Kale - Delicious AND nutritious? Apparently these words CAN co-exist!  

Chestnut Gnocchi with Vanilla-infused cherry tomato - The gnocchi for me was a bit starchy - not sure if it is because of the way they are shaped (thick, round slices).  The vanilla-infused cherry tomato was bursting with flavour.

Lemongrass Ribs on a bed of Cannellini beans - I want the recipe for these ribs now!  Wet rub with hints of fish sauce.  These were nicely caramelized without being too sweet.  The beans were really fresh. 

Chocolate Oatmeal Brownie - If you are a slow eater, the gelato will have melted by the time you get to dessert.  I felt the oatmeal brownie was a tad dry.  Whenever you're using oatmeal, it sucks out a lot of moisture, so definitely more wet ingredients in the mix could solve this problem.

Chef Wood is extremely down-to-earth so you are in good hands at Hawthorne.  I like that he is creating employment for the community and that he is hoping to add an educational experience for his staff outside of the normal scope of running a restaurant.  A great addition to the neighbourhood!"}
{"text":"Totally not sure why this place has such mediocre reviews, I had a fantastic meal there last week and have been telling everybody about it ever since :)

I went with a friend on a Tuesday night and the intimate bar and restaurant was quiet but the music was fantastic. I believe when I sat down that a Doctor Who cover was being played over the speakers -- who told them I was coming for dinner that night?

They have a good selection of wine, cocktails and craft beer. Since this was just a few days after Thanksgiving, I opted for Spearhead's Hawaiian Style Pale Ale. They still had their summer beer menu selections, so I'd be interested in seeing what the fall/winter ones will look like.

To start, I ordered the Niagara Tomato and Peach Salad, a colourful and bright plating of fresh fruit and vegetable, served over a peach mousse with pine nuts and basil. Not a huge serving but enough to whet the appetite. My friend had the quinoa salad which looked like a cute square of quinoa with goat cheese and other fillings.

Since this was more of a lighter dinner (as I said, day after Thanksgiving!) we opted to split the ribs instead of getting two meals. The ribs fell right off the bone and were extremely succulent. A bit pricier than I usually spend on ribs, but they also tasted completely different that the regular rib-fest style that I'm used to. I'd highly recommend getting it, but it's not the easiest to share. 

Our server was charming and attentive, it lead to some great conversation and the smaller tables made it seem more intimate and charming (I hate restaurants that have two-seaters with a huge, deep table in between, making it seem like you're miles away from each other.)

I hear their lunch specials are pretty good, I'd definitely return to check this place out during the day, and you should too."}
{"text":"Can't delete my review, inadvertently left for the incorrect restaurant. Please disregard this review."}
{"text":"food overall was okay, although duck confit probably had entire week sodium intake.
but what left a bitter taste though was a $5 charge for a glass of filtered Q water! even though we clearly asked for good old tap water. what a great way to scam your customers, while pretending to care about environment and sustainable practices!"}
{"text":"Great food and outstanding service by the two gentlemen who served me this afternoon. 

Shrimp was a little bit on the blander side, but overall, a very satisfying meal for the price point. 

Only downside is ... menu does not have many options."}
{"text":"Nice service, underwhelming food.

I booked a table for six at six on a Saturday (easy, friendly service there). It was quiet when I arrived. The main dining room is not large, so I'd recommend reservations even if you're only two, if you're set on trying this place. I could see one or two groups suddenly filling the room. The atmosphere itself is clean and bright, next to the street. 

I don't think there was a Foursquare feature that day, which was a little disappointing. Maybe I just missed it being offered, so that might be my fault. 

A couple of us got the housemade sodas, and one was a fantastic ginger flavour. 

For an appetizer, we split the meats and cheeses sharing plate. Although the large portion was marked for two to four people, it was fine among six. Our server thoughtfully split the portions between two boards so we didn't have to reach, and she brought us a fresh basket of crostini without being asked (she was great).

The sharing plate had smoked duck, sausage, sliced beef, figs, three Quebec cheeses, gelatin, grainy mustard, and other items. It was a nice assortment, and we had a good time mixing them in different combinations. Even though there were more of us than the portions were intended for, I think each of us got to try everything. 

For mains, it turned out each pair of us had the same dish -- steak frites, Peking duck pho (me), and the special of the day, which was perch with spelt risotto. 

The steak frites looked delicious. The 8 oz. steak came pre-sliced, which I have mixed feelings about ... but it was done the way asked, and the fries were praised all around the table. It came with a spoonful of homemade (?) ketchup. They gave my friend salsa verde when she asked for some hot sauce (kind of a fiend for spice). 

The Peking duck pho, on the other hand, was kind of terrible. Maybe we just didn't get it, but neither of us liked the broth at all. It was strangely dark, and a little oily by the end. It smelled good, but tasted bland, with a vaguely bitter taste in the middle. The pickled pumpkin was interesting and provided a nice tart and sweet flavour contrast to the fatty duck. 

I didn't get to taste the perch, but the risotto was not very good. It seemed undercooked for risotto, even if it was just risotto-style. 

The portions here meant you could easily leave room for dessert if you so wished. They have a small menu of desserts. I was up for trying the Elvis, but when my friend found out that they had run out of the Earl Grey creme brulee, we decided to settle the bill and move on with the evening.

Our server was very sweet. She was quiet under the medium-loudish music, so if you were sitting at the end of the table, you really had to lean in to hear her. Otherwise, she was polite, attentive, and helpful. When we asked at the beginning of the meal, she had no problem splitting our checks, which is always super appreciated. She brought us a little palate cleanser with our bills.

Maybe I had higher expectations because of the 4-5 star reviews here, but I wouldn't come back."}
{"text":"I had my eyes on Hawthorne for many months after learning about their farm-to-fork (=locally sourced ingredients) concept and commitment to supporting employment training - very cool! Tonight I was finally able to make a dinner reservation for Winterlicious '17 (a miracle since they are usually totally booked out, which made much more sense after I saw how small the restaurant actually is). 

5/5 stars for the flavors and quality of the dishes! I truly did enjoy the food here and they are vegetarian friendly. Unfortunately all the portion sizes were SO TINY... I definitely left still hungry. I guess this is Winterlicious after all, but I felt like Hawthorne may have interpreted this to a new level. My partner and I ordered the Daily Croquette Poutine and Sunchoke Trio for starters. The croquette dish can be made vegetarian by asking them to not use poutine sauce, but I would not recommend getting this dish since it was literally just 3 potato balls sitting on a bed of grass. Sorry, but the flavors weren't there. I would recommend getting the Sunchoke Trio however! It was also so tiny, but the texture of the potatoes was so crispy, yet chewy (perfection) and the grey SAUCE tasted amazing. I ordered the Whole Roasted Carrot Ginataan  main (vegan!) and again it was so small, but they used the same yummy sauce and the crispy onions (?) were delicious. The carrots were undercooked however and the presentation was a bit lacking since such a tiny portion was served in a huuuuge, deep bowl... Why. After being thoroughly teased by my super small, but delicious appetizer, I was so excited when I saw the size of the massive entree bowls until I saw the actual amount of food :')

The dessert was my favorite! I took my Lactaid, so was able to have the Winter Vegetable Cheesecake, which did not disappoint! The sauce was not overly sweet at all and retained the earthy flavor of beets like it should. The carrot cake crumble was perfect too in that it tasted freshly baked and had large strands of real carrot. The cheesecake itself was not too sweet and was rather light with a hint of pumpkin.

3/5 for the service since they were pretty slow, but all the servers were very friendly and their smiles made us feel very welcomed :)

Also pretty LOUD here - I had trouble hearing my partner from across the table.

I would come back again one day, but maybe order from their regular menu next time for a more satiating meal!"}
{"text":"Came here for a summerlicious dinner on a saturday night at 7.30pm. There were still a few tables available when we were seated. They had a large wine selection on the chalk board and good cocktail choices too, their drink special that night was $6 for any classic martini. They only have 2 beer choices, one was steam whistle for $7

We got the lamb gyro and chicken skin taco for appetizer and both were delicious! The lamb gyro had lots of flavour with home fries like potatoes and their tzatziki sauce was great. Chicken skin taco had kimchi and some diced cucumber and radish on top of deep fried chicken skin as the base (you can't go wrong with crispy chicken skin it's always the best part when you eat fried chicken anyways)

The ribs for entree was presented nicely, the corn bread wasnt dry and mealy, however the ribs were a tiny bit on the dry side. They also provided a bowl of water and lemon on the side to rinse your hands out (old school swiss chalet style!) The beef brisket entree with grilled endvie was delicious. As a person who doesnt like peas - the mashed peas were amazing almost felt potato like. And the green curry sauce had a strong kick. 

Got the cheese ice cream for dessert - which was fun - it came with popcorn and caramel sauce! Also tried the Eton Mess - sweet cherries and strawberries with fresh cream and meringue bits it was sweetly satisfying. All the portions were a good size and wasn't left hungry.

The service was nice, a bit slow but that didn't bother us, we were seated in a comfy 2 seat booth, it was quite enough to have good conversation as well. When we left around 9pm there were only about 2-3 other tables left restaurant. It was felt very casual and cozy in there, would love to come back to try their regular menu!"}
{"text":"I would call Hawthorne a hidden gem. The food is great, the staff have always been friendly and the restaurant itself is quite lovely."}
{"text":"I didn't like this restaurant too much. I was not impressed by its carefully curated menu of local Ontarian goods, its stylist menu brought in a cutting board.  I was put off by the fact that the soup of the day was a cold Borscht one. A cold soup on a rainy day!  Couldn't they adjust the menu? There were only 3 tables having dinner. No one would have noticed the menu change!

The main dishes are pretty limited and there were items I had no interest in ordering (hamburger, pickering, red cabbage). I ordered the summer pasta which came with seasonal, summer vegetables. It was good except for the inch thick oil at the bottom of the dish! My tummy paid for it later in the night.

I had the lemon creme brulee which was exquisite. A glass Cabernet Franc from Niagara (Between the Lines) accompanied my meal.

The service was great though. My friend and I stayed there until they started dimming the lights! We got the message and left. Good service, menu can be improved."}
{"text":"Some dishes were delicious while others were mediocre. 3.5 stars rounded up for good service

The beet and beef tartar was our fav dish. Interest taste combination. The whole grain salad and ribs were average and nothing special. The four square dish was interesting. Thought having the pancake in the end was a bit strange tho.  Everyone has to try the panna cotta. Mmmmmmm
The petit four at the end of the meal was an excellent touch :)"}
{"text":"Best meal we had during our week in Toronto. Fresh, flavorful, very high quality ingredients. Friendly, attentive service. Bavette steak was perfect. Fries amazing, including the house made ketchup. Piri piri chicken quite flavorful. Bulgogi tofu crispy and delicious with flavorful slaw. Portions neither small nor giant. A perfect dining experience."}
{"text":"Came here for summerlicious - great decor and friendly staff. I got the Mexican street corn - delicious but small in size and thankfully not on the cob so it wasn't messy. The Caesar salad was delicious, and the egg served with it was perfect. The blueberry pie was okay, I wish I got the cheesecake. If you check in on Yelp, you get a free glass of wine which was great - house selection of a white and red, I got the Sauvignon blanc. One of my friends ordered the egg roll and streak frites and the other ordered the sausage and schmaltz carbonara. No complaints from either of them!"}
{"text":"Joined 3 friends for dinner on the recommendation of one of the girls who was dining with us, who had been before and loved it.

I wasn't so impressed.  The menu changes regularly so they don't post it on their website which is a little inconvenient but they did have a fair number of options written on their blackboard.  Good thing I'm not a vegetarian though, because their only meatless/fishless option was rice and beans... yes. Rice. and. Beans.

I started with the Diablo cocktail ($14 for 2.5oz) which was interesting, but good. made with Tromba tequila and ginger beer. It was nice without being too sweet. It was good enough to enjoy but not something I slammed back (which I usually do).

Anyway, the 4 of us split two orders of arugula salad and a starter of \"bruschetta mussels.\" I'm not a huge fan of mussels but they were pretty average, in a tomato and wine broth. They were a little fisher tasting than what I've had before and that kind of turned me off. Plus, they knew there were 4 of us but they only brought 3 small --- SMALL, thin slices of toasted baguette.  I asked for another piece, which they were happy to bring. I'm just surprised this wasn't addressed before it came to our table.

We ordered: 2 x deconstructed shepherd's pie, fish (I think it was haddock, but I can't remember) and I had steak.  The shepherd's pie was chosen based on the recommendation of diners at an adjacent table and as far as I know, my friends enjoyed theirs. To be honest, I wish I had ordered that instead of the flank steak.  My flank steak was ordered medium-rare but arrived rare (which was fine... I don't mind it that way) with roasted radishes and fries.  It was pretty basic...expected. Nothing more to say there.  The steak arrived already sliced which I think caused it to go a little cold, and my steak knife arrived after my meal was placed in front of me.  The fish, which my friend ordered came uncooked or just very, very undercooked - cold inside and well, just raw inside. She had to send it back.  

We opted not to go for the bread pudding, which did sound good or ummm... whatever else they had that night... and decided to go for just coffees and biscotti.

The biscotti was nice and the espresso was smooth and tasty - great way to end out meal.

All-in-all this was an OK place.  Service was alright. Our server was very pleasant and knowledgeable and able to make recommendations.  The busser was really sweet if a little awkward (could have been a newbie!)  They did comp my friend's coffee to make up for the undercooked fish.  As we paid, our server presented us with free tickets to the Green Living Show.

As usual, company makes a meal so I don't have any complaints about this place, although I have nothing outstanding to note either.

I would probably go back to Hawthorne and would recommend it as worthy of a try for people looking for somewhere different to eat.  The price was fair and the meal portions were fair - not too much, not too little. Food was fresh and generally light. The cook should refine his/her abilities given that my steak was undercooked and my friend's fish was raw but meh... it was quickly corrected so no biggie.  

I wouldn't recommend this place for vegetarians.  While there were 3 options for veggies (carrot soup, spicy or crusty tofu or something, and arugula salad) there was only one veggie option for a main, and as I said... beans and rice. What people feed their dogs in the Caribbean."}
{"text":"I REALLY wanted to like this restaurant but unfortunately I was disappointed.
It's close to my work and home and it's new and looks really nice on the inside but a few things were disappointing.

First of all, we went at lunchtime which was around 12:30 and upon being seated we are told right away that the mussels are out. How could they be out when we came during lunchtime, the restaurant wasn't THAT busy and I feel like that sounds really disappointing and discouraging when the minute you sit down you are told that they're out of something.

I found the menu to be quite simple and not with too many choices, I am not sure if they have the same menu for dinner as they did for lunch, but it was a bit boring.

I had seen online that they have a lunch box item which looked pretty interesting but when we asked the waiter about it he didn't explain much and just said that they don't carry it. Was that a temporary thing? Was it never there? I guess we will never know because he didn't seem too apologetic nor did he give much justification.

We both ordered the pulled pork sandwiches which we were thoroughly disappointed with. I had a salad and my friend had the tomato soup.

The pulled pork was extremely dry. Usually pulled pork is really saucy but this one was extremely dry and not very flavourful. My friend literally had to soak up her sandwich in the tomato soup while I dumped all of the ketchup we had and asked for extra. We felt bad complaining so we tried our best to eat it but as excited as I was when I initially sat down, the sandwich really is what did it for me.

I am not sure if the other items on the menu taste better but the selection just did not \"wow\" me and my friend mentioned she had been to the restaurant before and had a chicken sandwich which she also said was quite dry and flavourless.

Not sure if I will give the restaurant another try. The waiter as hard to wave down even in such a small place so maybe they were short-staffed that day."}
{"text":"Through my workplace recently, I had the opportunity to dine for lunch at Hawthorne. I was excited because it had so many accolades and positive shout outs about it that I couldn't wait. I'd heard so many good things about the place and checked out their site for the menu items. I was happy to learn that their food was made with local produce and meats and that they had a MealShare program where you buy an entree and a they give a meal to a starving child.

Because our lunch was being paid for by the organizing group, we were a bit restricted to the menu options but I had thought that wouldn't be a problem and since my lunch was being paid for, I had no right to complain. Besides, even on a restricted menu, I can usually find something I like to eat.

Out of our selection I chose the mixed local greens with beets salad over the onion soup because my stomach hasn't been doing well with onion-laced dishes lately. It was ok but nothing special really - just a mixed green salad with some large-a** beet chunks which I cut into smaller pieces and some kind of basic dressing but I wasn't sure what that was. I saw a colleague's onion soup and it smelled/looked delicious which she confirmed was.

Since I knew I wouldn't do well with the 'mushroom cream sauce' in the pasta and I wasn't in the mood to have the beef-cheek Ramen, I opted for the Smoked Chicken Breast/Turkey sandwich which I thought couldn't really go wrong, right? Sounded great...

My 'sandwich' arrived and it 'looked' delicious although, from the start, the Texas-thick toast didn't impress me much (maybe a nice soft bun would have been a better choice) and I absolutely HATE cranberry sauce or anything like that on a sandwich. Since the description of the meals are very scant, I was not expecting this for my meal.
Regardless, I cut into it with a fury of an appetite because I was starving. The first thing I noticed (and made me want to spit it back out!) was that the \"smoke\" of the chicken breast was so overpowering, it was nauseating - I've eaten plenty of smoked food in my life and this was way over the top. Now pair all that with a smudge of cranberry sauce smeared onto the bread and a glop of gravy and, sadly, this did not go over well with my taste buds nor my gut. My colleagues around me (one of them who enjoyed the soup) also did not like this sandwich and they all had similar complaints to mine - there were about 6 of us who ordered this dish.

Needless to say, I didn't finish the meal.

To end, it would have been nice to be able to order their Earl Grey brulee but due to the restricted menu, this was not an option for me. They did provide our two tables with platters of brownie tidbits and basic shortbread cookies. Again, nice but no WOW factor there either.

I did hear my other colleagues give positive comments about the Fife Pasta dish and the Ramen but having seen the dishes, there still was nothing really outstanding about their food. I've eaten at other 'organic' or 'local food' restaurants in the area - one just up the road from this one - and they really did have that 'wow' factor in their dishes.

Overall, my expectations from what I'd heard far exceeded the actual dining experience I had. I couldn't figure out why this place was so packed. Have Torontonians really lost their ideals for actual good food??"}
{"text":"I returned here recently for lunch and although my original order came out looking lacklustre, our server quickly remedied the situation with a fresh order and a discount. I really want places like this to succeed because they seem to offer a great blend of educational opportunity, local food, and a pleasant dining experience. Burgers normally aren't my thing, but the one I had here was A-OKAY!"}
{"text":"We were here for summerlicious lunch and the food is really delicious! Had the chicken skin taco which I thought was going to be greasy but it wasn't and very crispy. The kick of spice from the kimchi was a nice added touch. Next I had the piri piri chicken which was crispy on the outside but so moist on the inside...and the sauce went perfectly with it. For dessert I had the aged cheddar ice cream with corn jam and popcorn which was hard to picture in my head but the flavour mixed so well! A little salty but a little sweet with the caramel sauce. Service was excellent all the waiters and host were very attentive and made sure we were enjoying our food. We will definitely go back just to try other items on the menu."}
{"text":"Since my last encounter with Hawthorne a year ago, I have always been dying to come back again. Chef Eric Wood's 4 square meal was delicious, creative, and memorable. All in all, great experience from food & beverage to service!

On our recent visit in January 2014, my friends and I have decided to drop by Hawthorne for a quick, light dinner before heading out to our board game night at Castle. I was very surprised to find out that Hawthorne has changed ownership! They have taken out the famous 4 square meal and no longer had the Yelp app check-in offer for free house made pop. #shocked #speechless.

Luckily, I saved a check-in offer a while back that I never used for Hawthorne. The server told me that the Yelp offer was taken out a long time ago, and was confused why I still have the offer hehehe... It was very nice of the server to still honour the free house made pop :) and so, we each received a free drink on the house! We all ordered their Ginger pop, which was sweet and refreshing. Sigh, but I do miss having my drink in a glass boot (see old photos!) lol.

Moving on, we ordered a few dishes to share:

- Smoked Salmon Crisps (2pcs) - tasted alright, wish there were more pieces!
- Buttermilk Fried Chicken (3pcs) - the coleslaw and aioli were a nice touch
- Mushroom Gnocchi - decent dish, flavours go well together :)
- Pulled Pork Poutine - loved the fries, but not enough meat, meat was a bit jerky-like 
- Flourless Chocolate Torte - delicious cake, but the marinated salty(?) Hawthorne REALLY threw me off
- Lemon Creme Brulee - SO sour. RAWR. but one of my friend loved the tartness.

Overall, I felt that I did not enjoy it as much this time around, even though the food was not bad. I guess I was just a bit upset that the highly anticipated 4 square meal was taken off the menu. Service is still excellent - very friendly and accommodating, thank you so much! I believe there are still lots of room for improvement. Keep up the great work, Hawthorne. I shall be back :)"}
{"text":"Came for the Summerlicious lunch with a friend. I was intrigued by the menu and was pleasantly surprised by the flavours presented. I had the chilled Tomato mole to start and my friend had the Chicken skin tacos. My chilled soup was well blended and had nice subtle mole complex flavours. The tacos looked plain but was reported as crunchy and good. Next we both opted for the sous vide Chuck burger. I've never had sous vide red meat so I didn't know what to expect. The burger was very juicy but was missing that charcoal grilled flavours that the best burgers in the city have. However the corn relish and grilled peaches definitely added sweet and fresh flavours to the burger. An overall small but good burger. Finally we both had the Aged Cheddar ice cream with corn jam and popcorn. I was intrigued by this one on the menu but could barely taste any cheese flavours! It tasted like a bit pungent vanilla ice cream. Loved the corn jam and the crunchy popcorn. I definitely appreciated the corn toppings! So fresh and summery! 

Overall, the menu was interesting and the food was tasty and cooked well.  Service was nice as well. I also had a pint of Steam Whistle beer for only $5. I'd definitely come back for their regular menu."}
{"text":"We had been \"stalking\" the restaurant for several weeks waiting for them to open as I live down the street. We finally had a chance to eat there last night. Excellent!

My boyfriend and I are light eaters so their menu format works perfectly. The server was very knowledgeable about the menu too which I appreciate as I can't eat gluten. Any dishes he had doubts about he confirmed with the kitchen. They were friendly and accommodating without making me feel like a pain. I love locally owned and ran restaurants where the food is made with a love of food and they know everything that goes into it because they make it all! 

We started with the Lemongrass Ribs with saut√©ed greens and white beans. The ribs had a nice subtle smokey flavour and melted in my mouth while making  me think of a crazy combination of southern BBQ and Thai street food. 

Next up was the steak and frites. The steak came perfectly medium rare, sliced and arranged on the plate with kale and sliced mushrooms in a red wine au jus. The kennebeck frites were crispy and soft plus salted and spiced perfectly. They make their \"ketchup\" in house as well and that was a lovely accompaniment to the frites. 

Next was the chocolate gelato with fresh strawberry. 

For beverages we had the bottomless in house carbonated water and I had the watermelon basil soda. The soda was very tasty and a nice change from an alcoholic cocktail. I like that they offer this as an option. 

Service was excellent. Friendly, humorous but not intrusive. 

Admittedly, the meal was a little on the \"meaty\" side but that was our own doing. Next time I plan to try the pho!"}
{"text":"Finally had a chance to check out Hawthorne with some of my besties. Definitely was not disappointed. 

I picked the Four Square meal ($22 for dinner), which changes on a daily basis, but on the evening we visited it consisted of a lentil dish, a gravlax salad, a meat dish (I think it was beef cheeks) and the dessert were mini eclairs. 

Some of the other mains looked very interesting (duck pho?) so I will have to head back to try some other dishes.

The decor here is lovely, much more homey and upscale than Fabarnak - great date venue or for dinner with the girls. 

Service was A+, the server was knowledgeable on the menu and gave us a great description of what we were eating when the food did arrive.

Take advantage of the Yelp check-in offer and grab a homemade soda (5 flavours to choose from) served in a cute BOOT-shaped glass!"}
{"text":"I came here for lunch for Winterlicious 2017. The restaurant is very quaint and quite small, with an open concept kitchen. Our service was great, and I love that this restaurant participates in training people to enter the hospitality industry. 

To start, I had a carrot and ginger soup. It was pretty good, and I liked the texture, but it was missing a bit of seasoning. For my entree I had the beef brisket sandwich. The bread was fresh, but there was way too much bread for the amount of meat in the sandwich. I ended up eating only half of the bread. The caramelized onions were really nice, and the small amount of beef I had was tender and flavourful. 

For dessert, I had the french toast bread pudding with Chinese Tea anglaise, sprinkled with brown sugar. This was my favourite dish by far. I loved the flavours and the portion size was nice. 

Overall, I wasn't super impressed with the execution of the dishes, but I love the restaurant concept. I want to come back to try their regular menu, because I find winterlicious/summerlicious isn't always the best indicator of the quality of a restaurant. The plating was absolutely gorgeous as well."}
{"text":"Food was shockingly delicious! The restaurant is used to train people in the food industry so sometimes it's less than polished but food turned up looking to get and A on the quiz!!"}
{"text":"Personally I have always had great experience here--not to mention the fries are amazing here!!!

This time, my review is based mostly on my experience as a sole diner during Winterlicious.  I decided after a long stressful day at 1.45 pm (after being in the office at 7am) to go and enjoy lunch.  The menu was decent at Hawthorne and it being the last day of Winterlicious I decided why not .

Walking in I was greeted with a friendly smile and was given the option of sitting at a table by the window or the bar, I opted for the bar.  The host and the bartender were very friendly and attentive.  A bit awkward (I assume the host was quite new) but with good intentions.

The Kale salad I ordered was quite large but delicious.  I ate about half and left it there, took some time but the host/waiter realized I was not going to finish it and asked if I wanted to keep working on it or clear it--I told him I would work on it with my main and he said Ok!  The main was brought out promptly thereafter, burger and fries which was a huge portion.  I ended up packing half the burger, half the fries and the rest of my salad in a take out box (and boy was it still delicious for that nights' dinner) .

The dessert I tried was a coconut bread pudding which was alright--I was never a fan of bread pudding but love coconut.  All in all I wasn incredibly full and had a lovely experience.  $23 was well spent!

{"text":"Tis the season of giving and that is certainly what is happening at Hawthorne Food & Drink in Toronto.

The concept of Hawthrone Food & Drink is all about giving back to the community. The restaurant is a social enterprise of Hospitality Workers Training Centre (HWTC), a non-profit organization based on a sectoral workforce development approach. People who are unemployed can access free training and career development at Hawthrone to help them gain a job in Toronto's hospitality industry. In 2015, HWTC trained 300 participants at Hawthorne and other partner facilities and about 80% of these trainees were successfully placed in hospitality jobs around Toronto within the same year.

Not only does Hawthorne provide training and career development to those in need of the appropriate skills, but Executive Chef Ricky Casipe believes in a 'Farm-to-Fork City Food' approach and uses only local, seasonal and sustainable ingredients to create the delicious dishes at Hawthorne.

 
I finally had a chance to check out Hawthorne Food & Drink and was seriously impressed with every aspect of this restaurant. First and foremost I love supporting restaurant's that give back, so it was a real pleasure to dine here and taste some of the locally sourced meals from Hawthorne's innovative menu. 

The atmosphere of the restaurant was quite cozy and beautifully decorated for the holiday season. The wait staff were very attentive and friendly and we didn't have to wait long for anything. Everyone was warm and welcoming which really made my experience at Hawthrone one to remember.

The menu includes small shareable plates and main dishes. For drinks, there is a selection of wine, beer, cocktails and non-alcoholic beverages. We had quite the varied tasting menu which left us feeling very full but completely satisfied!

All of the dishes were beautifully plated and contained many ingredients from different cultures which Chef Ricky likes to use as an inspiration to create his dishes. My favourite shared plate was the Cauliflower. Although it's meant to be shared, I could easily eat the entire thing by myself. I really enjoyed the different variations of cauliflower as well as the sumac and black tahini to compliment it all. My favourite main dish was the Trout. It was cooked perfectly and paired nicely with the light tea broth and fennel. I also must mention that the french fries here are UNREAL. They are dusted with a delicious sweet and spicy seasoning and cooked to perfection.

I had a great experience at Hawthrone and I hope you all get a chance to stop by this holiday season. Not only will you be supporting a wonderful establishment that does good for others and the community, but you'll also feel good knowing that everything you're eating is locally sourced, seasonal and sustainable."}
{"text":"Free Yelp Soda at Hawthorne Food and Drink?!

Just make sure use Yelp App and check in and you will receive a complimentary House made Pop that serves in a cute little boot! We enjoyed our Pear Cardamom and Lemon Lime Ginger Mint both really refreshing! Burp!

Since we were here during lunch time, so we decided to order:

Soup of the Day - Mushroom ($7)

Paella Bomb ($9)
- Nicely plated and it tasted as good as it looked! Clams, Mussels were so tasty with just a hint of spiciness and so much flavours!
- Rice was cooked perfectly al dente with great bite!

4 Square Meal ($16)
- changes daily so best to follow them on Facebook or Twitter for updates
- I found 2 of the squares were very similar taste and ingredients (Beans)
- Though light and healthy but just something lacking

Hawthorne has this really laid back vibe. And I love the social responsibility and helping the community concept!

Hawthorne is definitely worth repeat visit!"}
{"text":"I've been looking forward to going here so was sadly disappointed when I got my meal. I had the chicken pasta and it was a gummy completely tasteless dish. For dessert had the cherry cake which was also a gummy raw like middle. The kale blue cheese salad was misleading I expected chunks of blue cheese but there was some sprinkled in the salad dressing."}
{"text":"After being spurned at Beerbistro because they were \"too crowded\", I looked on Yelp for another highly rated place nearby and discovered Hawthorne.  It was early on a Saturday evening and I was freezing cold and it was nearby so I made the scary trip down Richmond Street a couple of blocks past Yonge to the restaurant.

I sat at the bar and was promptly greeted by an enthusiastic young lady (who I took to be a manager of some type).  I ordered a cocktail, which she prepared expertly.  It was called Sexing the Cherry or something like that and it was quite good.   I asked what the cut of the day was for the steak frites and she didn't know and she asked two line cooks and they didn't know, but finally found out.  Several minutes later when one of the guys came up and told her the cut, she was kind of snarky when she told him \"You're 20 minutes too late with that\".  As I was sitting right there and witnessed the exchange, it made me uncomfortable.

The food was okay.  I see people raving about it but I'm not there.  The steak that night was more like roast beef, which is fine but I would have preferred something like a skirt steak.  It was cooked well but the sauce/gravy on it was sweeter than I would have liked and tasted like a mass-market bottled sauce that had some extra spices thrown into it.  Fries were fine although the accompanying sauce was also very sweet.  

For dessert I had the Elvis, which sounded good on paper but was only so-so in execution.  It consisted of banana bread, three tiny squirts of some fruity sauce, powdered peanut butter and some carmelized bacon-banana brittle.  That last part was outstanding.    However, the banana bread, which was grilled, in combination with the powdered peanut butter and the inadequate amount of \"jelly\" left the dessert feeling very dry.  Luckily I had another bottle of their wonderful seltzer with which to wash it down.

Service was on point the whole night, but it seemed very scripted.  It was as if someone had read a book by Danny Meyer or something and then tried to re-create that.  It was textbook good, but it seemed to be missing warmth and sincerity.  The right things were said and done because those were the right things to say and do, not because they were actually felt.  It's hard to explain but the whole thing left me a little cold.

I think this has potential to be a four-star place, but when I looked back at other restaurants of this ilk which I rated four stars, this just isn't quite there yet."}
{"text":"Bravo!  I don't have enough superlatives to express how much I enjoyed this place.  RIght downtown but a little off the beaten path, I came here for a work function.  We ordered a number of the appetizers including the Brussels sprouts with bone marrow, fries, chicken skin tacos, and croquette poutine, and they were all off the charts delicious.  Perfectly seasoned.  The main I ordered, which was the Christmas Double Down, was a vegetarian dish done RIGHT.  It had a light sprinkling of chevre, sauteed mushrooms, cranberries, and two slabs of stuffing - the balance between all the ingredients was perfect..  I find a good mark of a restaurant is how well they make the vegetarian dish, and in this case Hawthorne Food & Drink nailed it!  

Our server was also very engaging, and had a great sense of humour to boot (a lady with glasses and an asymmetrical haircut).  

Wine selections, all from Ontario, were all very smooth (a surprise to me that this exists in Ontario!)  The Sangiovese from Prince Edward County was particularly pleasant.  The Southbrook was great too, although frankly, we tried all of them and they were all great!  

Also: one more thing - I really appreciate the ethos/business model of  the Hawthorne as well - supporting trainees in the hospitality sector, and also supporting local ingredients.  Great idea and execution.  

I hope to be back again soon!"}
{"text":"Hawthorne is built not to just serve tasteful healthy meals that are farm-to-fork but is also an establishment that caters to people who need hospitality experience.

Hawthorne is a social enterprise -  Hospitality Workers Training Centre (HWTC). HWTC has trained many individuals at Hawthorne and at other partnered establishments. Individuals who have been trained include unemployed youth, Ontario Disability support and Ontario Works. In 2015 with the help of HWTC, 80%of the people who were trained were successfully placed in hospitality jobs within Ontario.

We were hosted by the executive chef Ricky Casipe who is only 25 years old. Ricky has flourished at Hawthorne as a creative chef who embraces the farm to fork city food ideology. He explained all the dishes with great detail which exemplified a passion and knowledge for what he does. The dishes he provided also reflect that age does not determine the experience needed for a title, but the motivation you have to accomplish something you believe will also get you there. Thank you for providing great service and dishes.

This is the half roasted squash drizzled with coconut+ginger ginataan dressing with fried shallots and quinoa. Chef Ricky inspired by his Filipino cultural background had used a sweet dessert flavour of ginataan to accompany the roasted squash to bring out a sweet fresh taste to the squash."}
{"text":"I have been meaning to try Hawthorne Food & Drink (@HawthorneTO) since it first open but maybe it's a bit too late since Chef Eric Wood, the visionary behind the restaurant have since left for other projects and his sous-chef Bihn An Nguyen have since taken over. Hawthorne's mission is to empower and educate hospitality workers in the city and work alongside UNITE HERE Local 75 to create a paid intership program.

Wanting to make a reservation for 8:30pm Friday but was told that they were full and only seats at the bar available. But arriving on time, we found a half empty restaurant 

Upon entering the place, I can only imagine how bright and beautiful it will look during the day with light shinning on the mason jars through the large windows.

 They had an all Ontario Beer list, very short wine list, house-made sodas and an extensive cocktail list.... with pages to choose from, I just had to decide on one.

JitterBug Perfume $12
~ Victoria Gin, Lillet, Candied Beet Juice, Honey/Craked peppercorn
~ Since I love beets, I just had to try this one and it was delicious. Not too sweet w/ a hint of the beet juice and don't you love the mini beet salted beet skewer on top 

Lamb Empanada $10
~ braised lamb, sweet potato, salsa verde, cured lemon yogurt
~ Haven't had a lot of empanada before but I quite like this especially with the delicious salsa verde.

 Crispy Fried Quail $10
~ 12 herb buttermilk crust, boxwood honey, z'athar sprinkle
~ This was probably my favorite dish of the night,the crust was super flavorful and crispy while the quail itself was slightly undercooked which left it incredibly moist and soft. 

 Smoked Beef Cheek $22
~ butter braised bak choy, stone crab chow chow, crispy potato cake
~ This is where the where the disappointment start; the beef cheek was melt in your mouth but the sauce was very one dimensional (something was missing).... ~ couldn't taste the butter in the bak choy, it felt like it's either steam or boiled and then slightly grill.
~ The stone crab was overall unnecessary and everything was lukewarm

 House-made Pappardelle $17
~ kale, leeks, charred fennel, toasted pecans, raisins, tomato, spiced butternut veloute
~ Love everything here except the pappardelle itself which was way overcooked and was stuck together in messy bobs/balls which is unforgivable.

 Elvis $7
~ Grilled Banana Bread, Candied Bacon, House-made PB&J
~ With that description, we just had to order this dessert although the disappointment with both of our mains. 
~ But thought the Banana bread was rather dry and even drier after being grilled.... then there was only a slither of the Jam and while the PB was in dehydrated (powder) form... which left the dish without any moisture. 
~ The thing that I enjoy the most was the candied bacon which was more a brittle had such intense bacon flavor.

 Apple & Rosemary Jelly (Complementary)
~ This was tart and refreshing, perfect way to end the meal.

Verdict :
~ This meal left me with more disappointment than anything
~ Maybe I'll come back just for the Quail and the cocktails ;)"}
{"text":"was so excited to go because seen them have booths at different food events and i follow them on instagram. accidentally went during Winterlicious (didn't mean to, just wanted to try it) and was thoroughly disappointed. the food was a good attempt at being creative but pretty bland for my taste. we sat at the bar and service ok. it was bright and nice atmosphere inside though"}
{"text":"Hawthorne Food and Drink is located near Richmond and Church, a short walk away from Queen Station. I had heard about this restaurant for a while now as it is which provides free training and career development for individuals in need of skills and employment. All the profits go back to the program which trains more people who are unemployed. The food Hawthorne uses is local and seasonal as well. Supporting the community, my friend and I decided to dine at Hawthorne Food and Drink for Summerlicious recently this year.

The restaurant itself is quite small and seats around 20-30 people in an intimate setting. During our time there, the restaurant was not full which allowed us to take our time and catch up during our meal. Upon entering, I was greeted and seated. Waiters came by to ask for drinks and I ordered a sangria. For the appetizers and mains we both ordered the brisket latkes and the pulled pork. For dessert my friend ordered the maple tart and I ordered the chocolate bar. The appetizer and pulled pork were both very good but the desserts were lacking. The chocolate bar I ordered was too sweet and too hard.

In terms of service, the waiters were super attentive and friendly. Our water was refilled every time it wasn't full and the service and pace of the entire meal was great. Overall, a great experience, would definitely come back to try the regular menu."}
{"text":"Such great service and a awesome menu for winterlicious. Can't wait to go back! Already telling my friends about my fantastic experience at the restaurant last night!"}
