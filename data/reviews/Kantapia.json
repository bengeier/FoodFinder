{"text":"Vraiment très bon. En lisant le menu je ne savais pas trop à quoi m'attendre mais mon choix à été excellent!"}
{"text":"Really good service, my new go to favorite Korean food in montreal, I'll be coming back here next time I'm in town"}
{"text":"Resto coréen sympa, mais trop de monde quand j'y suis allée et un peu serré comme disposition."}
{"text":"This place has decent Korean food at an affordable price. We had the bibimbap and tuna kimbap, which were relatively simple dishes. Be warned - the yelp page claims that they accept credit card, but I was told I could only pay with cash or debit card. I took 1 star off for misleading information."}
{"text":"I tried the Dolsot Bibimbat which was very good. Also, the fried Tofu with sweet and spicy sauce was excellent, the tofu was melting and the crust was perfectly crispy. I will come back."}
{"text":"Très bon coréen ! Je recommande fortement le bibimpap ainsi que les dumplings en entrée.
Service très agréable ainsi que prix très raisonnables."}
{"text":"I like the food here but my friend said it is not so good. For korean food, it's a little bit bland."}
{"text":"Had the kim chi jjigae here. It was really good! Generous portion of meat, rice cake and vegetables in the soup, seems relatively authentic, and the soup was tasty. Good amount of food for 9 dollars. 

Service was good - polite and friendly and efficient. Restaurant atmosphere was casual, not too cramped, which is nice. Would definitely go back."}
{"text":"Ordered kimchi jigae which had little taste and very salty and fried chicken rice which had a tasteless sauce."}
{"text":"Cute, really fast, food was tasty. Nothing super special but an affordable and filling meal."}
{"text":"i have always wanted to go to kantapia seen its colorful decor from the window everytime i pass on sherbrooke, when i finally went there i was not dissapointed, the waiter took us rapidly to a seet and the staffs were always very attentive for their customer they were nice and friendly, the food also came fast, i had a kimchi soup with soft tofu and it was delicious, my bf had a plate full of rice, beef and salad and both of them are delicious, then we shared rymnium which basically was the korean instant noodle hahah a bit dissapointed by that but welll instant noodle are still delicious haha, the only thing i could picked on was maybe the taste of kimchi that lacked a bit of sourness of well marinated kimchi ah well it was still good and obviously homemade so that's a plus. solid 4 stars!:)"}
{"text":"Ne croyez pas les photos les portions ont diminuées et les prix ont augmentés. Des serveuses anglophones. Niveau nourriture j'ai pris un combo les genre de croissants mondu étaient vraiment bons, les Kimbap étaient frais j'ai bien aimé par contre il y avais tellement peu de tteobeokki j'ai été déçu pour 15$ c'était bon mais pas les meilleurs pour moi niveau sauce j'aime bien avec l'huile de sésame.  Mais j'ai vraiment apprécié les tteoks qui étaient moelleux et vraiment agréables ! Il y a du bon et des choses à améliorer dans ce restaurant. Mais pour moi c'est assez cher niveau quantité/prix.

Ps: Je trouve ça sympa cette impression de \"homemade\" quand on voit tout le monde cuisiner."}
{"text":"I love this place. Or rather, I used to love this place. The food is excellent, service is fast, the little korean snacks are tasty, it's the korean restaurant the McGill ghetto needed. 

But the service sucks donkey balls. The tall girl is nice I guess; but the other shorter waitress is a BITCH. It was during busy hours, which I understand is stressful, but her attitude is crap. She threw the chopsticks on the table as well as the water bottle... which resulted in water everywhere, obviously. Every dish served was THROWN on the table, not placed, not served with a smile. She looked away from us and angrily freaking threw each and every dish. and, btw, they also made a mistake with our order. She ruined our lunch as her attitude and shitty service made us lose appetite and we left there feeling like shit. I'm not even expecting amazing service from an asian busy place, but having a waitress pissed at us because, uh, we chose to eat at their restaurant is not exactly what I expect either. 

So go there if bad service don't affect you, I guess, but me and my friends aren't going ever. again. or fire her please."}
{"text":"J'y suis retourné et c'était moins bien qu'avant. J'ai essayé le stew au tofu mou avec porc, le porc n'était pas bon.  Le bouillon manquait de complexité le goût tombait à plat.  Aussi je mettrais une sauce avec les kimbap sinon c'est un peu sec."}
{"text":"It is a kind of cute small Resto, not many seats, so in rush hour, maybe you need to wait quite more time but it will be worth it. The food is good and the price is very reasonable . They have takeout service also. We will be there often."}
{"text":"I've been to Kantapia numerous times since it is so conveniently located on Sherbrooke between McGill and Place-des-arts. Without the address ready in hand it could be easily missed due to its uninspired appearance. The decor is nothing outstanding but the place is always kept very clean and comfortable.

The first time I went, I got the seafood pancake which tasted more like burnt eggs than anything else. Turns out, I was unlucky and probably ordered one of their worst dishes. Later, I got to try their bibimbap, tonkatsu and kimbaps which were all very filling and reasonably priced. My favorite item on the menu is the spicy tofu stew which is one of the better ones in town. It's nothing you couldn't get in other cities with a larger Korean population, but great authentic Korean food is hard to come by in Montreal without getting away from downtown.

I have to mention that the staff is extremely friendly and helpful. One of them actually went out of his way to use his own data to help me find an address. 

Great experience. I will definitely return."}
{"text":"Super happy to find an equally cute and tasty place as Ganadara near where I live. Kantapia serves similar food, without several types of ramen and kimbap. But I'd prefer their bibimbap. Why? Because they put the freshest veggies in! Not shredded carrots, but actual vegetables like zucchini (it's really rare for Asian restaurants to use anything other than lettuce and carrots).

The meat dishes like galbi are really delicious, they never skimp out on the meat nor the banchan (side dishes). They often come to you when they notice that you're running low on your kimchi and ask if you need more, which is why my boyfriend and I often go there whenever we're too lazy to cook for ourselves. Kantapia is the place to be for some heartwarming home-cooked Korean food."}
{"text":"I am East Asian and I eat a lot Korean food back home. This one has a fair taste of the Korean. It took me three week not to eat Asian rice before I came to this restaurant. I was full and happy with the familiar food."}
{"text":"Its only once and a while do you food authentic tasting Korean food. I was in town for a mini vacation to start off the summer. I ordered bibimbap and my Fiancée ordered donkatsu. The service was decent and the place was quaint. My food came quicker than I thought and it was delicious!! It was one of the inexpensive places close to our hotel and I would recommend giving it a try. My only concern is outside seating was OK and kind of dirty especially between the space between restaurant and deck area. My puppy was happy to be out and about, we enjoyed our meal and what else could you ask for?"}
{"text":"Friendly staff. I didnt like the decor or the food. Went couple of times, but was always disappointed with their food. It tasted too much like homemade dishes compared to other korean restaurants in town. Maybe more healthy? But not that appealing for the money im paying. I dont think it is the worst korean restaurant but after trying couple of times, I don't go back."}
{"text":"Nice Korean food for a lunch break- it has a strong student life vibe and friendly crew."}
{"text":"Just one of the worst Korean restaurant in Montréal. I have been poisonned after eating in this restaurant. I am suspecting people working there gave me the rests or not fresh Products. In addition to this some racism issues (people are not treated the same in this restaurant)"}
{"text":"I ordered the vegetarian bibimbap and meat came on it. When I told them about the error, the insisted that I didn't order meat and told me that they wouldn't exchange it for free. I explained calmly that it was a mistake. I would NEVER come back here again. The server was rude and condescending. Avoid!"}
{"text":"Ganadara always has such a long line that Kantapia might be a good substitute. Bustling place, and we were 5th in line but we were in and out in about an hour due to the speedy service. 

Large portions for appetizers, and I liked that the free side dishes included more than just kimchi. 

Only complaint is that the bibimbap (stone bowl) was not prepped to a high enough temperature. It wasn't hot enough to turn the rice into crispy pieces and sizzled for less than 5 seconds I would guesstimate. Should be much hotter!"}
{"text":"You get what you pay for. It's good and all depending what you choose. Some dishes are way too salty, like their soups. It's a good spot for students though."}
{"text":"I love going to Kantapia! We found this place on Yelp a few years ago. I am surprised at how quick the service is and how fast food comes out. They have most of the traditional Korean staples and some interesting additions and specials. The service is friendly and informative. There is a semi open kitchen which looks clean. BimBimBap is amazing here! Everything is always great and loaded with flavor. I've never had anything less than perfection food wise. It is a bit fast paced and small so they want to get you in and out. It is a casual place. There are more traditional, formal Korean places in Montreal but I love dining here. It is a great place to start the night off right before hitting the town."}
{"text":"I got food poisoning after eating food there. I do not recommend the place unless you want to have terrible days and nights."}
{"text":"Reviewing this place again because I cannot reiterate how good it is. The service is friendly, quick and efficient. I've never had to wait more than 15-20 minutes for my food! The value of the food for its quality blows my mind. I order the soon tofu stew (accompanied with rice, kimchi and soy marinated potatoes) almost every time I eat here, and I leave stuffed to the gills.. For 8.50$!!! (Minus tax and tips, of course.) If it's extra chilli outside the day of your visit, ask for some barley tea (balli cha). You'll be warmed up in no time.  The tteok mandu guk (rice cake and dumpling soup) is a great cure for hangovers too."}
{"text":"I love going there after work or class, with friends or even by myself. Waitresses are super sweet, food is really good and inexpensive. The place is cute I enjoy the music... Nothing to dislike there!"}
{"text":"I've been waiting to review my favorite restaurant in montreal for quite some time. I've been here more times than I can say and normally that is paired with \"spent more money than I'm comfortable telling\" but that isn't the case for Kantapia. Everything is reasonably priced, with an average of $8 or $9 for a main dish. Everything on the menu is delicious, starting from the appetizer dumplings (fried or steamed) to the bibimbap (served room temperature or warm) to the always deliciously warm (and slightly spicy raymans. A favorite of mine & my boyfriend is to share the bibimbap & mandu rayman to balance out the cold & hot, fresh & salty tastes of the platters. 

What I can't skip out on though is the overall atmosphere of this place, quite literally from a Korean cartoon \"Kantapia\" exhibits it so with a bubbly charm. The homey setup of the kitchen that opens up to the eating area creates a comfortable experience so that you know your food is served freaked and prepared with care. Usually I can find a small negative in every place that I feel necessary to point out, but honestly, this is one of my favorite Asian food places Montreal, keep on doing great things!

All servers are generally foreign so have patience when it comes to comprehension! It is not out of rudeness that they ask you to repeat your order!"}
{"text":"Good food, great customer service, cute mom and pop restaurant. 

I got the spicy pork, which was great :) very tender and lots of flavour. I tried some of the bulgogi and ribs also, and they were pretty good too :) the servers were quite attentive and food came out fast

Great experience. I will return :)"}
{"text":"Lovely Korean food, nice staff, and very reasonable prices! I particularly loved the dolsot bibimbap that had lots of fresh vegetables and the kimchi and potato salad they served us banchan."}
{"text":"We ordered 2 dishes and paid for 3 because the waitress failed to ask what option we wanted and brought us a seafood option when we thought seafood and porc we're optional additions to the default vegetarian stew. Then they charged us for their error. Food was good. But our waitress wasn't effective and made sure that we paid for her error."}
{"text":"A small-ish place that does good Korean food. I got a tofu soup with rice, which was more than enough for me. I ordered it without egg, but the kitchen messed up my order and put an egg in anyway. Since it was at the bottom, I didn't find out until I'd eaten maybe half. I'm not allergic or anything, so it wasn't a huge deal, and the waiter was very nice and took it off our bill. Kudos for the service!"}
{"text":"We went here because it was cold and close to the Hilton hotel. The service was fast , food was decent & spicy but the proportions were small for the price. Ordered the bimbabap, veg ramen and the dumplings."}
{"text":"This was my very first time eating Korean food. The restaurant is a little small but is very bright with pop music playing. I ordered the dolsot bibimbap vegetarian (tofu in place of beef). My order came out quickly and the dish was very, very good! The blend of texture and flavor was an eye-opening experience with the kimchi included. The final mix of rice, sauce and vegetables was absolutely delicious. I used a lot of hot sauce for the dish though. It was also quite filling."}
{"text":"Amazing food for a cheap price. This is by far my favourite Korean restaurant in Montreal. The service is always quick and friendly. Wouldn't recommend to go there as a big group, since the place is quite small and every time I went, it was packed!"}
{"text":"We ordered the bibimbap and the combo which included 3 dishes: kimbap, tteokbokki and an assortment of tempura and other fried delicacies. I was expecting this place to be really good but unfortunately left very dissapointed. That's not to say that the food was bad, but it didn't meet my expectations. The fried foods were very heavy and greasy, the bibimbap was pretty good, the kimbap was dry and tasted a lot like grocery store sushi and the tteokbokki was decent. Overall just okay, I probably won't be back since Ganadara is down the street and hits every sweet spot you could have regarding Korean food."}
{"text":"walking distance to my office in downtown and it is not very crowded during lunch time.

the korean food here is pretty standard but the portion is a bit small

one thing i really like is they used a bit of purple rice in the rice they give you (not just plain white rice)"}
{"text":"Good food at very reasona le price. Every week we come to this place. Rice roll has a very mild flavor but blends all the ingredients well. Fried Kimchi Rice is our favorite now!"}
{"text":"I only went to there once,cos the dish is just ordinary! But the seafood soup is great."}
{"text":"Kantapia was packed full when I went. The waiters were overwhelmed but the food did not disappoint. My tuna kimbap was delicious and the tofu soup was as well. I've been to several Korean restaurants in Montreal and this is the best that I've tried."}
{"text":"This place rocks. Looks can be deceiving and this place would be a testament to that. 

The place has some great authentic Korean food. You can eye-witness the cooks making the food from scratch in the area right next to the tables, so that's as authentic as you can get. Can i get a BIM BI BAP? 

The price is very reasonable, and the wait staff are very friendly. 

You will not be dissapointed."}
{"text":"I have been to kantapia a thousand of times.  Ok... Maybe I am exaggerating here, but I have been here very often, I used to live 5 minutes away from it.  
Delicious korean food, sooo affordable, super friendly and attentive staff!

The restaurant has a cute feeling to it, very homie.  It gets pretty busy, but if you need to wait for a table it usually doesn't take too long.  I tried a bunch of different dishes here, and they consistently served me very good food."}
{"text":"Studying next door at UQAM's science HQ, I come here often for lunch. Their bibimbap is really good, mandus as well. So far nothing but good things to say about this place. Taste is authentic. Always a good option if you need to spice things up on lunch."}
{"text":"The loveliest Korean place I've been to in Montreal! Servers are detail orientated and quick to notice anything we may need. Warm atmosphere and not too rowdy. Bulgogi is authentic and highly recommended."}
{"text":"What a cute little place this was! The servers were super friendly, and the food was just great! We were surprised by the metallic chopsticks, but they were easier to use than expected. We had the Kalbi and the Bulgogi - both super excellent. The portions are slighhtttly on the smaller side, so you might need to order a few plates to share, but a really nice place overall."}
{"text":"Je suis allée dans ce restaurant au moins 3 fois et toutes les fois j'ai adoré! La place est petite, il peut y avoir de l'attente mais sa en vaut la peine. La nourriture est très abordable et excellente. Je vais y retourner sans hésiter. Le personnel est gentil. C'est de la nourriture réconfortante et typique, ne vous attendez pas à de la haute gastronomie."}
{"text":"Cute little place with non expensive korean food. The chicken katsu is very crispy and they serve those healthy rice to make me feel better while eating fried stuff."}
{"text":"Kantapia has been my recent favourite for several months. Their food suits Asian tongue. Their tuna kimbap tastes superb, one of the best in Montreal. All their rice meals are on par with typical Korean food style. Although I haven't eaten in the restaurant, from what I observed, it is a bit crowded and can get loud as this is a much popular place. I always call in advance for take-out during dinner hours, and despite the rather heavy lineup they always get the meal ready within from several minutes up to twenty. Top-notch flavour, unquestioned five stars!"}
{"text":"The seafood soft tofu soup was better than I've ever had. Flavorful and spicy. This opinion is coming from a Korean that have lived in and traveled to Korea, Los Angeles, New York,  northern New Jersey, Virginia and Chicago. Please don't change a thing so I can come and eat your soup on my next business trip out to Montreal."}
{"text":"awesome korean food!  you know it's legit when an entire korean family is cooking in the kitchen.  very cute establishment.  felt like i was eating at a friends house.  if i visit montreal again, i will definitely make a pit stop at kantapia."}
{"text":"The server was very nice and friendly, and the experience was quite pleasant overall. Their cucumber water is very refreshing! My only issue was that the food was a little bit bland, and I would have preferred a little bit more meat in the bibimbap. A great place if you like Korean food!"}
{"text":"Had the kimchi soup. Was your standard, authentic flavor, with all the right stuff (kimchi, pork, tofu), but nothing too special.  Soup was not spicy enough. 

Kimchi was newly made- I prefer kimchi that is aged more and with more sourness and kick, but that may be personal preference. 

Altogether good meal, at a wallet-happy price."}
{"text":"went back and had the kimchi jigae, and actually sat and ate there. delicious! piping hot and super flavorful. I really appreciated the fast service, side dishes, and whole pitcher of lime water for myself. definitely will come here regularly when I'm in Montreal."}
{"text":"Jeune. Service est excellent et la nourriture saine et délicieuse. Je recommande vivement pour une ambiance coréenne à Montreal."}
{"text":"Excellent petit restaurant sur le pouce. Un repas typiquement coréen, loin de barbecues et autres. Un petit coin  de rue de Corée en plein coeur de Montréal. Très bon repas, Service rapide et efficace. Un repas comme le  bas."}
{"text":"amazing food! amazing fast and sweet service!!! amazing atmosphere, so cute and one of the best restaurants in montreal the dolsot bibimbap and kimbap are delicious"}
{"text":"I was in Montreal for a quick get away and was craving some Korean food.  Living in New York, I yelped for a Korean place to eat in Montreal i originally missed this place when I came here a month ago due to maintenance they opened after 2pm didnt know assumed the place was shut down.

I ordered the bulgogi and the kalbi and the bi bim bap was real good there better then I had in a long time. They give you a decent amount of food but coming from America the standard here is much more then the standard served in other countries so I knew I would have to eat twice the normal amount to satisfy my hunger.

The restaurant has really nice decor and the chalkboard adds a nice touch to it. The kitchen is literally right in front of you so you see them cook the food and the staff is very attentive and kept asking us the food was up to our standard. All in all it was great food and a good atmosphere will repeat."}
{"text":"I'm currently indulging in their Soondubu Jjigae while writing this review. Their price point isn't too expensive and they're located at a very strategic place. It's near McGill and walkable from Place-Des-Art metro too. Their food isn't as spicy as other places, which might be great for people who aren't too familiar with Korean food. It looks sort of like a little cafeteria and is not too fancy, which I enjoy as well. They also have vegetarian options for a lot of their food, which is super considerate! I always appreciate a good heads-up. I also love their multi-grain rice since I'm pretty health conscious!"}
{"text":"Had an amazing experience here, great service great food, nice place for students and feels healthy yet tastes so good!"}
{"text":"I come here quite often as its one of the only Korean restaurants near McGill. The atmosphere is very nice but the space is quite small, and there's often a wait, which is kind of annoying because it's still a bit of a walk from McGill, especially during the winter. As for the food, first of all, they have the best potato side dish in Montreal. Sweet and soft. And unlimited. Make sure you ask for them if you're taking out (sometimes they don't give it unless you ask). As for the dishes, most of them are good but not spectacular. The kimchi jiggae is not bad, a bit sour, but quite small portion wise. I always avoid the bibimbap because I find that there's not much in it. The lettuce is raw and does not match at all with the rest of the ingredients. Their meats are quite savoury though, especially the pork. Another plus is that they always give black rice instead of white rice, which is supposed to be better for you. Finally, the price is very very reasonable. Overall, I like this place mainly because of its prices, because I love Korean food and because there aren't that many good Asian restaurants around McGill, but it would most likely not be in my top 5 Korean restaurants in Montreal."}
{"text":"We had to wait a little but it was well worthy the wait ! Food is great , the tofu soup is on par with some of the best I have had . service is fantastic which makes the dinning experience feel that much better .

It is debit and cash only ."}
{"text":"Kantapia is a youthful, cheerful place that kinda reminds me of a kindergarden.
The taste of the food is good (yay for side dishes!) and everything looks very cute, but I really wish the portions were bigger (especially the ramyun dish that barely contained one pack-worth of instant noodles). 

I guess it's a good place for a quick/cheap lunch, but since the restaurant is often packed, I don't go there anymore."}
{"text":"Got takeout of two bibimbap (one veggie and one not). It was fine. but that's all. I'm not a Korean food expert but I know what I like and I have had better bibimbap. The staff was nice and we didn't wait long for our order. Waiting was pleasant, as the restaurant was mostly empty and we could sit at a table to wait. I will probably not come back."}
{"text":"Great location downtown, near my job. Korean staff and cook.
Gets overcrowded really fast cause it is small. They serve Korean fast food such as bibimbap, bulgogi, Korean style sushi, spicy sea food soup, ramen soup, etc.

Good price, tasty, ok service. Better French service would be appreciated even if I don't really care myself."}
{"text":"I have often, of my own bias, ignored the establishment when walking by; the store front is a bit cartoonish even if subtle. Albeit it's form is alone a vanity of a personal approach, the food itself is delicious!

I had (and will always do) the soondubu. Considerate portion and fair amount of spices and tofu. Nestled in a stone pot, the serving vessel keeps the stew to an mindful temperature. Will be back."}
{"text":"Affordable and tasty food in general. I ordered the combo with teokbokki, tuna kimbap and vegetarian mandu. You get a pretty big portion for only 20$. Special shout out to the rice cake, they are amazinggggg! Super soft and chewy and they don't stick to your teeth. I was amazed by their teokbokki, they have probably the best texture and tasted great too. I took the non spicy option and it was still good. 

My friend ordered the bibimbap and I don't know if they change their ingredients according to the season, but their bibimbap suited summer weather. The vegetables tasted refreshing, especially for the iceberg lettuce. 

The deco is pretty casual, nothing too special. Btw, their washrooms are really dirty..."}
{"text":"Disappointed in my meal! So much more expensive now, my sundubu jigae wasn't good at all. I used to love this place"}
{"text":"La place est vraiment sympa, on s'y sent de suite bien. Et la cuisine est toute ouverte, on peut donc voir les cuistos, et ça, c'est sympa !
Côté repas, c'est bon mais sans être original ni très surprenant. A choisir un resto coréen, nous irons dans les autres déjà testés"}
{"text":"Korean food, yay! I feel limited on where to eat korean food as I don't necessarily explore enough. This is another good place to go to."}
{"text":"I've tried their donkatsu, tteokbokki, kimchi jeon, and some of my friend's bibimbap. All of the food I've tried was amazing. The only bad thing would be that size of place and manpower might be slightly insufficient as they are quite popular. My Friend had to get out water from his own bag because no staff had the time to answer to our water request. Then again, it was understandable. The restaurant was full and the food was great. We were satisfied and happy."}
{"text":"I visited this place last year. If I could, I'd give it 3.5 instead of 4 just based on the fact that we were constantly ignored by the staff (yes they were busy but come on!!) 

Randomly stumbled into this small restaurant and it was constantly packed. We waited too long time to be noticed, seated, order, get our food, and pay (we had to get their attention each time). 

The food was really good. We got the beef dolsot bibimbap, chicken gang jeong (the breading and sauce were good but the chicken was weird and tough - definitely not chicken breast!) We also ordered appetizers, including deep fried veggie dumplings & sauteed rice dumplings in spicy sauce - excellent. The veggie tempura basket is large so only order if you're very hungry or many people. Their kimchi is also really good. 

Would go again and overall, a great culinary experience but expect long waits."}
{"text":"I went to this restaurant because of some good reviews. The restaurant is just few blocks away from my work place, so I thought it would be nice to pay a visit. However, I am kind disappointed. The meal has very small portion. The soup is only half full with 3 slices of pork. The price is also raised up compare to the menu I saw on the internet . Although staffs are nice, the food is not up to my expectations. This kimchi soup only have spicy flavor which lack some complexity. I would maybe visit again for other things on the menu if I didn't bring my lunch to work but I don't really recommend this place to someone who look for a good meal with reasonable price. You can find better place in the area."}
{"text":"Kantapia is a cute little home-y korean restaurant less minutes away from McGill University. The lineup is always long when you go during lunch or dinner time but I find the food very average. However, it is worth mentioning that their prices are student friendly. 

Throughout my 4 years at McGill, I've been here many times and tried a lot of things on their menu but I have yet to find a dish that is above average. Their ramen is just a pack of glorified instant noodles, their rice cakes are very ordinary, their tofu soups lack a depth of flavour, their kimbap rolls taste more like rice than anything else and their katsus are over cooked, too oily and heavy and drenched with too much gravy. 

Overall, Im not a big fan of this place."}
{"text":"I'm no expert on Korean food. Before ordering from Kantapia I had eaten Korean food once in Toronto and it was delicious. 

I decided to try this place because it is near my job and I was tired from eating at the same restaurants. 

I was happily surprised to note that there were a lot of Korean people eating in Kantapia, which is always a good sign. As I was completely clueless about Korean cuisine, I asked a couple of questions to the waiter, who even let me taste the sauce for the Don Katsu (fried pork), which I ended up ordering for take-out. By the way, they have a particular take-out menu. 

It was absolutely delicious. The fried pork was filling yet not heavy. I was a little concerned about the purple rice but it was really good and sticky thus easy to eat with chopsticks. There was also a small salad. Overall, a great balanced meal. 

Best of all: The price. $10.06 with taxes. What is there not to love about a full meal for $10 or less?"}
{"text":"Seating is limited and suitable for at best a party of four maximum. Atmosphere is crowded - but that's to be expected considering their low prices for their fare. Water is provided along with side dishes of kimchi and pickled potatos (which tastes great). Ordered a Mandu Ramyun - while the noodles were nice and thick and quite filling, the dumpling is nothing to write home about. Service is brisk and friendly - waiters/waitresses will ask you how's your meal going, but they're definitely in a bit of a hurry. 

Suitable for students. Will prolly come again."}
{"text":"Loved this place. Delicious, eclectic & inexpensive. Awesome dumplings, fried tofu & raymun with delicious broth. Left full & feeling super healthy."}
{"text":"I've heard good reviews of Kantapia before coming here and I wasn't disappointed. The service was quick and efficient. I received my food in a timely matter. The food itself was pretty good, of course not the most amazing Korean food, but the quality meets its price. I got the kimbap rolls and the ramyeon. Both were delicious and perfect for a cold winter day. The prices were cheap enough for you to eat a good meal and not worry about breaking your wallet. I personally will be returning again, as it is one of the most convenient and delicious Korean restaurants in the neighbourhood. Highly recommend trying it out"}
{"text":"I ordered the Bulgogi and it was delicious. It came with really good rice and salad. I went on a Wednesday during lunch and the place was full. Luckily, I got a seat and the service was very fast. The only disappointing part is that they don't accept credit cards so I had to go across the street to an ATM."}
{"text":"Every time I walk by Kantapia, it's full. Every time I eat here, it's full. And I know why. The restaurant is kept clean, the food is fresh and delicious, the servers are polite and helpful (but they should work on smiling more), and the service is actually pretty quick for such a crowded restaurant. 

The moment my Mom and sister arrived at the airport, they wanted me to take them to a Korean restaurant, and this was the first place that came to my mind. I've always looked forward to eating here. Bonus is that the prices are more easy on the wallet than other Korean restaurants I've been to in Montreal (If I were to give you a count, I would say about 5 others. Seoul Chako doesn't count as a Korean restaurant to me by the way.) 

We had a combo of kimbap, dukbokgi, and tigim. Along with that, there was some jaeyook bokgeum. Everything was very delicious. My mom was satisfied; she couldn't pick what she liked best because they were all equally satisfying. I would recommend this place to any of my Korean friends. Or any friend for that matter. I do suggest that they give out more side dishes (called banchan in Korean) because offering only two side dishes for one group seems a bit unusual in a Korean restaurant. 

We had a young Korean waiter. He was very polite, announcing the names of the dishes when they were ready to be served and apologizing when a customer sat too close to us. When we wanted to add cheese to the kimbap in one of the combos, he told us of the extra charge that would be added ($0.50). And I love it when a waiter reads off all our menu items the moment we finish ordering. It gives me the reassurance that there won't be a mistake with our order."}
{"text":"Price is great for students and its location attracts a lot of students nearby in the ghetto. I've been here four times and always ordered bibimbap with plenty of sweet and spicy source on top to make a good mix. I also tried Bokki this time and liked the soft rice cake. Kantopia is my first choice when my craving for Korean food hits hard."}
{"text":"Cheap, quick, and delicious.

They don't have a large variety of offerings, and what they do have is very casual Korean cuisine. Nonetheless, they do it very well and I have yet to leave there disappointed. 

My choice meal for a quick dinner with friends or just a small reward for getting through that midterm!

My favourites are the seafood soondubo jjigae and chicken cutlet kimbap."}
{"text":"Great service and good. As an American coming to Montreal for vacation, we were pleasantly surprised by this Korean restaurant. Staff was super friendly and service was quick. Everything tasted home cooked and delicious. Bulgogi and tteokboki were delicious; honestly the best tteoboki I've had. Highly recommend. Nice casual spot with plenty of indoor and outdoor seating"}
{"text":"This is not the best Korean restaunrant i've been to, but definitely not the worst. Their food is average. Service is quick and effective. I recommend the stir fried pork with rice and their fried chicken as appetizer."}
{"text":"Donkatsu is so good! Bi Bim Bap was so colorful and fresh and the staff were friendly. Price range is reasonable, I've been to expensive Korean restaurants and Kantapia serves way better! I would definitely come back!"}
{"text":"Yum! Super tasty Korean food near McGill. Totally comforting and cute decor with nice staff. Also affordable for the student budget but only downside is that it's constantly busy!"}
{"text":"Oh, Kantapia and your nostalgia-inducing days of being the only Korean restaurant within a suitable walking distance during the cold winter months. No matter how much I like to rag on you for not having the best Korean food I've ever had, you're still better than what almost all of the sad Chinese restaurant offerings that Montréal has. *cue sobs*

It's a cute little place that clearly caters to the college crowd given its close proximity to the McGill campus and several residential halls, so don't be surprised if you have to wait a while for a table. The food makes it pretty much worth the wait for the most part. While the banchan (kind of weird-tasting kimchi and a sweetened potato dish) are nothing to rave about, the bibimbap is always a solid choice. The cooks fill the bowl with vegetables and actually create a rather solid meat-to-topping ratio so that you get a bit of everything in each bite. Also, they use colorful purple rice as an added bonus! Make sure to add some of the spicy sauce that comes along with it for an extra kick and dimension of flavor.

Overall, Kantapia is a great place to go if you're on a budget and want to fill up your stomach at a cheap price. Go for it!"}
{"text":"Great spot for Korean food! The service is friendly and fast. Small location but very nicely decorated Korean style. I ordered bibimbap and dumplings, both were delicious. Highly recommended, but I suggest you arrive in small groups as seating is limited... Enjoy!"}
{"text":"I was in Montreal for a bachelor party, staying at the Hilton right next door. We opted to go light on food expenses and spend more on other activities. Kantapia was a great solution for 3 quick meals. The food tasted very authentic, the combos they have are pretty cheap, and the service was good. At least for a meal, or two, or three.. it met our standards for what it was."}
{"text":"????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????1;1??????OK???????????????3??"}
{"text":"I had fried chicken, fried rice cake and tempura udon. The food was o.k. The floor was too dirty even for a snowy day."}
{"text":"Super affordable and delicious Korean food! Plenty of options for vegetarians too."}
{"text":"Kantapia is a small little Korean eatery, located off of Sherbrooke.  On my way back to my place, I decided to get a to-go order for a later lunch.  The place itself is cute, and the menu offers a mixture of Korean and Japanese dishes such as ramyun, kimbop, donkatsu, and bulgogi.  I decided on the Jae Yook Bokeum, which was the spicy pork.  The meal came with a healthier version of the rice (purple color, due to the bean's bleeding), which was cooked perfectly and quite delicious.  The spicy pork was not that great, as while the meat was thick-cut and generous, the taste was just mediocre; the hubs was not a fan of the food at all!  I liked that they gave you a side of chopped iceberg lettuce, dressed in Italian vinaigrette and also a small side of gamja jorim (these came hot and was pretty good).  Service was super friendly, and you can see the ahjummas cooking in the open kitchen, preparing each service.  Many Korean exchange students were seen here, slurping down on some ramyun and chowing down on the kimbop.  On a side note, CCs are accepted here.

{"text":"One of my favourite Korean restaurants in town! I've come here a countless number of times since I've started school in Montreal. My favourite dishes are the dolsat bibimbap, songdubu jiggae, and the bulgogi (sooo flavourful). Their kimchi and potatoes are delicious too! Staff is wonderful, although it's a shame that they're usually super busy. They really need to expand this place -- there's almost always a line! And the wait can be 20 mins. The price is reasonable; I usually spend $13-$17 with tax and tip per meal."}
{"text":"Very cute little place and the Korean food was very good. Our 11 month old enjoyed it too! Very reasonably priced too."}
{"text":"I love love this place. Been to many in Canada, they have the best tofu soup! I am in love!  
This is a very small place, super busy, but the girls work like a flash, very efficient. Their portion is good as well. I am full, but not overly stuffed."}
{"text":"On the hunt for something new, Kantapia stood out with good reviews, friendly prices, and fairly close.

Turns out, it's a tiny place that seats 15-20 people. Located downtown on rue Sherbrooke close to McGill metro. The floor to ceiling bay windows, perfect for people watching, ensure plenty of light brightens the dining area. The colorful signage and K-pop(which wasn't blaringly loud), along with the young attentive Korean staff create a nice vibe. The open kitchen is a nice touch. 

Service was stellar. The waitress brought us menus and a carafe of clean cold water after we sat down. A small dish of kimchi and another of sweet potatoes were provided while we were waiting for our food, which came out quickly. I expected prices to be on the high end(being downtown and all) but was pleasantly surprised that $10 was enough for my meal with enough leftover for a tip (check out the photo of the menu).

As to the food, the sweet potato appetizer thingy was really nice, but I found the kimchi a little too salty, I've never had kimchi so salty before, so that was a bit off putting.  My friend had the tofu jjigae which was very nice and I would definitely recommend it to anybody that enjoys tofu.  I had the kimchi bokkeumbap with ham, which while also tasty was a bit too salty thanks to the abundance of kimchi.

Definitely more of a lunch place than a dinner place this as a nice option for anybody that works in the area.  The prices are friendly as are the staff and the food seem fairly authentic for  Korean \"fast food\"."}
{"text":"Great food, good prices, and quick service unless they are PACKED (which is admittedly quite often). Love their vegetarian bibimbap and the tempura! The decor inside is also really cute. This is the first place I ever tried Korean food and now having tried other places, this is still my favourite. I make a point of eating here anytime I'm in Montreal!"}
{"text":"Irrefutably, my favourite fast-food Korean restaurant. They have excellent service and provide you with small side dishes for gratis! Miss this place already. The price is very fair too."}
{"text":"It is cheap, near mcgill, i have been there many times, the food is not bad."}
{"text":"This was close to out hotel and well reviewed, so thought we would give it a chance for Saturday dinner. 

Sat right down and were informed that their credit card machine was down - cash only. We said this was fine. Started with with beef dumplings, followed by bibimbap and ramyun - both original/classic. Everything was tasty, especially with the addition of hot sauce. Ramyun was very spicy - so no additional heat needed there. Service was quick and friendly. I'd try some different options next time, but we didn't have enough cash on hand to get crazy this time around."}
{"text":"Such a yummy spot to eat at. The service was great. Definitely will go back the next time i'm in Québec."}
{"text":"I used to work around here and I frequently had lunch here. Maybe I'm a bit tougher on Korean restaurants since I compared everything to my mom's food, but I found this place just to be okay. I find that the food could be better seasoned and sometimes I feel like it's a bit bland.

I usually go for soft tofu soups because it's one of my favourites, but I end up asking for soy sauce or salt to get some flavour out of it. However, their tookbaegi bulgogi (Korean BBQ in broth with rice on the side) is great, and this is the dish I get most of the time if I want to leave satisfied."}
{"text":"We stopped in for a few apps, as we were staying at a hotel nearby. It was quite delicious and I would recommend this eatery to anyone in the area.

My only disappointment was that they did not seem to serve beer, but I got over it.

Everything was delicious - especially the fried tofu balls!"}
{"text":"ONLY TAKE CASH OR DEBIT CARD!  NO CREDIT CARD--This place offers variety of very authentic korean food.  we tried ttuckbokki, Kim Bob, udon, dduck  mandoo  soup and fried vegetables.  all of them were really delicious!  we eat korean food at home so we know how authentic their foods are.  we thought the food would be sweet to cater to more western taste but they were actually prepared real korean style.  I would totally come back here when we are in town again.  two thumbs up!"}
{"text":"Debit or cash only. Great place for lunch time since it's quick and casual. The food is incredibly delicious but you might have to wait a bit to get seated. The bibimbap and the tteok bokki are my favourite items on the menu."}
{"text":"Definitely get your money's worth for your korean food cravings every now and then (everything is within the $10-15 range, after tax and tips). The atmosphere has a nice cozy feel. That being said, the restaurant is a bit small so I couldn't recommend it for large groups; it's more suitable for going with 1-3 other people. The take-out time is also a bit slow but it's nice to see your food cooked in front of you."}
{"text":"Really delicious home-cooking Korean food right near McGill that is super affordable. I arrived at about 5:30 and waited maybe 5 minutes for a table at this tiny spot. The whole time I was there I watched the line fill and empty quickly and repeatedly, they are great at turnover here. 

The room is bright and adorable, the menu is full of delicious meals, all kinds of options, more than you see in most of the other Korean restaurants around town. The food comes out quickly and is clearly freshly made and super tasty - the fried dumplings and dolsot bibimbap were both excellent. Maybe not quite as excellent as Chingu, but cheaper and easier to access if you're downtown and definitely full of fresh ingredients cooked up with love. 

My one suggestion: get rid of the plastic plants that line the half wall between dining room and kitchen, they are just gathering dust and starting to look bad. Also maybe give the bathroom a scrub and a fresh coat of paint before it gets really scary in there. 

The staff here are awesome, fast, friendly, multi-lingual, working hard but never making you feel particularly rushed, smiles for days, just a general good vibe that, as much as the delicious food, has me looking forward to coming back."}
{"text":"Solid korean offerings!

Everything tastes fresh and authentic of a korean family kitchen.

Plenty of classics here, plus a few unique spins.

Kalbi, bulgogi, bibimbap and all your faves.

Prices are completely realistic and student-friendly.

Just bring cash or a Canadian ATM card. 

No credit cards allowed.

And no booze. 

A solid 4+ star meal any day of the week."}
{"text":"Absolutely delicious. I discovered this place probably 2 months ago and have been back at least 4 times since. The location is extremely convenient but more importantly- the food is great.

I made the very wise decision of coming here post-workout and starving, so we ordered a large portion of what was on the menu. The bibimbap was delicious and quite large. The seafood pancake is one of my favourite dishes at an Korean place, and it is equally as delicious here. I also LOVE the soft-tofu soup- nice and spicy and perfect for those cold winter, snowy days. My boyfriend likes the pork katsu and dumplings, both of which I tasted and also enjoyed.

The prices are also great, especially given that I'm a student. My only complaint is that I wish the little side dishes at the beginning were more extensive. At the Korean places I'm used to, in the San Francisco Bay Area, there are way more little starters than what is offered here. Also, a couple times it took quite a while to get served even though we were there at an odd time of day and there were very few other customers. 

Anyway, despite these small issues, I plan to come back relatively often- especially once the temperature drops even more!"}
{"text":"My family and I walked into this place as it was in a very convenient location downtown. We had to wait approx. 15 min (we went in around 6pm), as they had open spots but did not have a table for 4. We ordered kimchi fried rice (which wasn't too sweet and rly big in portion), kimchi soup, and bibimbap. The portions were really generous compared to the price. As a Korean, I would say the taste was 3/5 (compared to traditional Korean food), as it was more on the sweeter side (and catered to the western taste). However, the huge portions, cheap price, and convenient location make up for the loss in taste!"}
{"text":"Cute korean restaurant. The food was delicious and the service was really good, the waitress was super nice! The service was also pretty fast. I really enjoyed the food and the price is pretty fair."}
{"text":"Visited on Mon., but unfortunately it was closed. Didn't regret making all the way again to it on Tuesday. Fair enough price. Recommend Dolset bibimbap!"}
{"text":"Cheap, fast, really delicious. Servers are friendly. Just wish there was some seating room for people waiting for takeout!"}
{"text":"Small but homey and delicious. 

This place is small and unassuming, but clear, cute and fast! 

Ordered the spicy tofu soup (delicious, possibly the best I've had to date...except for my Gma's of course), the dumpling and rice cake soup (also delicious, super flavourful soup and full of stuff!) and the ¿kimbap? And dumpling and spicy rice cake dish combo (also delicious and super plentiful). Everything was super hot and fresh!!! It came with small side dishes of kimchi and the sweet potatoes. We also had fried chicken in spicy sauce and it was hot, fresh, and super crispy...everyone was ordering it for good reason (this is why we decided to try it :p) 

If I lived here, I'd probably come back all the time! We came at three in the afternoon and it was still full, so I can't even imagine how long lines would be at peak meal times."}
{"text":"4.5 stars. This was my second time trying Korean food (the first time was just awful; food was way too spicy and too hot, and my stomach was off that day - definitely not a good combo!). My sister and I split pajeon and bibimbap. Both were great and filling. Pajeon is like an egg flour pancake with seafood, and it was quite good with a generous portion of seafood inside. Bibimbap plate (not hot stone bowl) was delicious, light but also filling. Definitely drizzle it with a bit of chili sauce, even if you're not a big fan of spiciness (it's not too spicy if you just drizzle it, and the chili gives an extra kick to the dish). 

Great, quick service. Highly recommend this place to be introduced (or re-introduced if your first experience was bad!) to Korean food."}
{"text":"Okay ramen, yummy chicken and bibimbap. Crowded usually but you can find a spot when its not supper or lunch time. Also another close place to McGill if you want to grab a quick bite."}
{"text":"I think here is exactly A-OK. At the same time im not a big Korean Food fan, but this place is good if you want basic, not too expensive and small cute korean food place. The food is okay, but I've had better korean food before, the service is good, and the location is good as well, in downtown on sherbrooke. They sometimes put outdoor tables and chairs, to make a small patio, so that may be nicer than eating inside in a nice summer day."}
{"text":"Perfect Asian food fix for our trip to Montreal. We got the soondubu soup, donkatsu kimbap, and steamed mandoo and they were all amazing! I personally loved their kimchi. Will definitely recommend to friends and would love to come back!"}
{"text":"Small but very busy self-seating eatery frequented by college kids but I have to say the food is very tasty. We ordered the pork & seafood tofu and fried meat dumplings and they are delicious. The 2 complimentary kim chi and potato sides are good but I am used to Korean restaurants serving 5+ side dishes in the states."}
{"text":"Very good prices for delicious food. The fried chicken app is a must-order!!! It's not as spicy as it looks - it has a nice sweet taste to it. Will definitely come again next time I am in Montreal"}
{"text":"Kantapia is great for what it is - a quick eats restaurant in a student area. 

The seating isn't spectacular, the ambience is bare but there is a lively buzz to the restaurant that is endearing. 

The staff are friendly and give advice on what to order and take the time to explain the more complicated menu items. The food is okay - the portions are generous. 

They have specifically marked vegetarian items on the menu which is a really great point and are sweet to warn that the broth for their ramen is chicken based. 

Go on a cold day when you're close by and are looking for a good meal to warm you up."}
{"text":"Franchement, pour le prix, c'est impeccable!  Les portions sont généreuses, la viande est tendre, la marinade est à point. Service rapide et courtois.  Ce n'est pas le meilleur coréen à Montréal, mais pour un bon repas rapide dans le secteur, dans des prix variant entre 10 et 15$, c'est dur à battre."}
{"text":"Awesome place! Highly recommend this awesome place! Verry good and pretty affordable price. Kinda small, but very delicious. Everything taste fresh and homemade. Not recommended for large group of more than 4. There's a 2 small  outdoor tables for terrasse option."}
{"text":"Some of the best Korean food I've ever had. Get the Galbi it's amazing. The tempura is very light and fresh and comes with shrimp, asparagus, sweet and regular potato."}
{"text":"This place was amazing! It's a small, family- run Korean snack bar. I suggest going sometime before 6pm if you wanna beat the dinner rush hour. We arrived around 6pm and we waited for about 5 minutes before being seated at their small bar (we didn't mind). We ordered tteokbokki and KFC (non-spicy for me), beef bulgogi, and some tuna kimbap. Everything tasted like authentic, homemade Korean food, even their side dishes. Their beef bulgogi was well seasoned and paired with purple rice. The tteokbokki was a pretty big serving for an app, and so was the KFC. Overall, it wasn't only cheap, the food was good and the service was very friendly. Would totally reccomend!!"}
{"text":"I went to this place while traveling in the Quebec area and had EXTREMELY rude service. I arrived here at 11 sharp which I thought was when they opened. The door was open and I was able to see the workers in the kitchen. I did not go inside but was standing on the doorstep. A young woman who looked like the owner said something to me but I wasn't able to hear because the restaurant was right next to a busy street. I asked the woman again and she answered that they open at 11 30 very rudely with an angry expression. Of course I did not go back to the place again. They might have good food but the most important thing should be respecting customers."}
{"text":"Je me suis rendue chez Kantapia un peu par hasard un midi. J'ai été assez déçue car je m'attendais à mieux, mais en soit ce n'était pas mauvais non plus.

J'ai testé plusieurs plats :
- Poulet Frit (gang jeong) : Très décevant selon moi. Trop gras et insipide. La sauce est un peu relevée, et on ne sent que ça. Le goût du poulet en lui-même est absent.
- Kimbap végétarien (similaire aux makis) : Bon et rafraîchissant !
- Mool Madu végétarien (dumplings bouillis farcis aux légumes) : Un peu fade également.

Les petits plus : une salade de chou fermenté et une salade de pommes de terre sont offertes et le restaurant est ouvert sans interruption du midi au soir."}
{"text":"Amazing Korean food! Among the best kimchi we've ever had. Beautifully presented dishes that taste just as wonderfully. Great service, as well. Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"Muy buena comida, haces un mix de varias cosas y realmente es rico, lo mejor de todo que es barato, ten cuidado que te ofrecerán tu comida en un tazón pero si lo quieres con el tazón son 2 dólares más."}
{"text":"My love for Korean food started here. As a uni student, the budget-friendly options at Kantapia were always appreciated and the food was for the most part always tasty! I have very fond memories of the tuna kimbap and the bibimbap. The concept is similar to the Ganadara restaurant without the crazy lineup. Highly recommended for Korean food lovers or those wanting to discover a new type of cuisine!"}
{"text":"Disclaimer: my sister and I are from LA and therefore have access to really good Korean food. I don't know how many Korean restaurants there are in Montreal, but will be reviewing from my perspective/experiences. 

Kantapia is conveniently located near the Hilton Garden Inn on Sherbrooke- my sister and I went to Kantapia around 6:30PM and were immediately seated at one of the counters. We were served pretty quickly, but service was a little harder to get a hold of in the latter part of our dining experience. Banchan (side dishes) were limited to two. 

My sister chose a bulgogi with noodles in soup (I forget the specific name of it) and my one sip of it was actually quite good. I don't think we've seen this dish in other Korean restaurants (or maybe have just missed it) but it was quite good. I stuck with the Dolsot Bibimbap. Food was good but nothing spectacular. I could definitely see how this would be hot comfort food during colder weather/winter. 

Although not apparent, customers are supposed to go up to the counter to pay for our food. At this point, the restaurant was packed and employees were running around looking a little frazzled. A large group of guys ended up getting all of their cards run by one of their own (I guess he's related in some way or form to the restaurant) but he shrugged at us after paying for his own portion and headed out. The waitress who replaced him afterwards looked a little unfamiliar with the machine. 

Overall, 3/5."}

{"text":"KANTAPIA IS THE BEST BIBIMBAP IN TOWN!

It's not a special restaurant - it's got weird murals on the wall and the menu is cartoon-themed - but the bibimbap is so good for the price, and they give you these INCREDIBLE potatoes and kimchi on the side every time. 

Also it's pretty damn cheap!"}
{"text":"The chicken was raw.... Maybe it was because there was too much dough.  

The food was okay overall - not worth the trip.  The waitress didn't even attend to us - was super thirsty at the end cause of lack of water."}
{"text":"A youthful multi-colored sign greets you outside the simple glass and metal framed façade. Around a quarter to 2pm, three patrons still sat at the front counter enjoying their warmth and view of the spring snowfall. I was greeted promptly and chose to eat in as I attempted the challenge of translating the paper menu (half French and half Korean). For this effort I was awarded thin stainless steel chopsticks that also looked to be a challenge in and of themselves. After a friendly server explained a few dishes (some of which I had heard of before and others that were completely new to me). I selected the 'Bulgogi' (strips of marinated beef served with rice and salad) over 'Galbi' (short ribs) or 'Dolsot Bibimbap' (a hot rock bowl version of Bibimbap which is a signature Korean dish). I also observed a combo plate that I decided better for a potential next visit. I passed on a dish that I had tried years before in Seoul called 'Katsu' (corn flake batter style fried chicken). The water they serve without being asking tasted funny so I drank my own tea to keep the bill under $10 before tax and tip. You can opt to sit at several counters, at a table or take your order out which lends to the local University crowd. Two women and gentleman worked diligently in the open kitchen area, which is only shielded by a hanging chalkboard menu. Small bowls of 'Kimchi' (a national dish served with many meals made in this case of carefully marinated Napa cabbage) and marinated bean sprouts are served first (the neutral bean shoots balance the spicy Kimchi). I noted that the servers and cooks taste their own creations which is usually a good sign. I managing the silver chopsticks better than expected piling a little of each taste onto each bite. The meat (beef) tasted a little like it had an \"American chop suey\" flavor which brought back memories of my youth (ironic in a good way I thought as I blended the bean sprouts into the beef). My fingers where getting fatigued I put the Kimchi on the main plate as well and ate the second half of the meal together ending with a few last bites by spoon. North American pop music was playing at a decent volume. My meal cost $9.75 before tax. Tired fingers, spicy lips and happy stomach sum up my first tasty visit."}
{"text":"Kantapia is a decent place for a quick lunch. They offer a classic menu of korean dishes and the service is quick. While not my personal favourite, I think it's a great place for someone new to korean food, as they offer combos at a reasonable price that let you sample different dishes. The ambiance is very casual."}
{"text":"I've tried a ramen dish, the bibimbap, and a pork rice dish.

For the price, the portions are a bit small, but given the quality of (most of) the food and the fact that Korean food is generally more expensive, it's warranted. 

The bibimbap and pork rice dish were both great, very tasty and classic Korean food. For these dishes I'd give the restaurant a solid 4/5.

However, the ramen (the dumpling ramen) was a gigantic disappointment. It could've just been the one I had, but if you've ever had real ramen before, order something else.

For roughly $10, the ramen came in a tiny bowl. It literally tasted EXACTLY like Nong Shim instant ramen noodles, which go for roughly $1.50 at the supermarket. I grew up eating a lot of Nong Shim ramen, and the resemblance was uncanny. The noodles were clearly prepackaged and the vegetables were practically the veggie packet that comes with Nong Shim ramen, plus a few pieces of corn. It's an shame to charge $10 before tax/tip for something I could make at home for $2. This would get a 1.5/5.

Otherwise, the atmosphere is great, it's a very cute place and in a good location. The service was at times inattentive, but for the most part quite good and courteous. 

Food: 3/5 (don't get the ramen)
Atmosphere: 4/5
Service: 3/5"}
{"text":"Got the chicken katzu, it was good. The purple rice I think was a cute touch... It was tasty overall, it was just not as great as I expected it to be, after being so hyped by friends. Oh, well."}
{"text":"Cest vraiment une ambiance de vendredi soir en tout temps ici. Délicieux plats frais.

Il ya de meilleurs Restos coréens mais pour de l'authenticité sur le pouce dans une embua ce dynamique vous ne serez pas déçu."}
{"text":"I've lived in South Korea for a couple years and I can say with confidence that this place does Korean food right. One of the things I miss the most is Korean street food and this place has a wide variety of mandu, dokbokki, and kimbap to offer. Very good prices and friendly service. Good place to go to for take out or in you are eating alone. One of the best dokbokki dishes that I have had outside of Korea. You can have a decent meal here for under ten bucks. Definitely recommend this place!"}
{"text":"This would be the perfect place to be at during a blizzard storm. Why? It's because you can get tasty boiling hot soups for cheap that will you keep you warm for the rest of the day. With charming atmosphere and service, this place would be hard to beat during winter. Once that soup is down in your belly, you feel like you can tackle snow storms!"}
{"text":"Back in Montreal after a month in Van, went here again for dinner as it was open on Labor Day, tried to go to Lola Rosa a couple blocks away but it was lined up (all the uni kids starting) so we went back here as we knew good food awaited. Anyway here was JAMMED pack and we waited 2 mins to be seated at the bad but then moved to a table before our meals when one freed up. Super busy, service was pretty good but staff seemed rushed. (understandable because of Labor Day and it being busy). Great food again and nice people when we were paying ! Had a good convo. Will come back again and hopefully update this review to a 5 star!"}
{"text":"CUTEST Korean restaurant in town! The inside decor reminds me of Gandara once-upon-a-time, the restaurant is small but cozy, love the ambiance. Their price is fair but don't expect very big portions. Their bone soup was really good and nutritious, but bimbap very average, but I would definitely return for the cuteness of this Korean place!"}
{"text":"This is a genuine Korean restaurant. I went their with a friend. We ordered two Dolset Bibimbap and one Chicken Gangjeong. They are delicious! The food was quickly prepared and the price is not very expensive. Thus, this restaurant is a good choice for work lunch."}
{"text":"Me ha encantado. Súper rápido en atendernos y servirnos. El sitio pequeño y acogedor. Muy autentico lleno de coreanos comiendo. La comida fantástica, hemos pedido un combo grande para dos y nos ha sobrado y muy barato."}
{"text":"As a former Concordia student, our go-to Korean was GaNaDara. When I heard about this place and saw the menu, it instantly reminded me of GaNaDara but one for McGill students basically. I went with a friend to try it out and wasn't super impressed. Everything tasted Ok, but not great - with the countless options of Korean in Montreal, I won't be coming back here."}
{"text":"This has very delicious and inexpensive food; very authentic. The place is not very large, so you may have to wait for a table at dinner time, but they also do takeaway."}
{"text":"Kantapia offers one of the most affordable and tasty food you can get near McGill campus. 

Within a solid 5 minutes walk distance from the campus, you can get their very reasonably priced food.

The inside decor is simple yet welcoming. Super good service and legit food.

Their dishes are not very spicy, but you can add spicy if you ask.
I personally liked their sundubu jjigae and seafood pancake.

Overall, I would recommend this place to any of my friends. Absolutely my favorite spot."}
{"text":"Great place for lunch! They have a varied selection of entrees, and the complimentary side dishes are quite tasty. While it gets pretty busy during lunch and dinner, it's much better to wait and have food here, than to do takeout."}
{"text":"I came here for 5 days straight. Loved everything about it... from the price to the staff. So cheap yet so good. The spicy tofu soup is great so are the kimbaps. Plus unlimited kimchi and potatoes.. perfect for the cash strapped student."}
{"text":"It's good. We had the dolsot bibimbap and bulgolgi.  The flavor of the bibimbap was great but the stone bowl was not hot enough so the crispy crust of the rice did not develop. :( The bulgolgi tasted great!  It comes with delicious rice and salad."}
{"text":"This place is always pretty crowded with college kids (like me lol) during rush hours and I can see why: very cheap, and tasty korean food. It reminds me of home food which I love! They also use the healthier mixed rice rather than just plain white rice which is a plus and their service is pretty fast and nice too. The inside deco is cute as well but nothing fancy. They offer a good amount of choices, and surprisingly all of them are pretty good! They also have set menus which offer decent portions for a variety of foods at a good price so I would really recommend their sets--you get to taste a little bit of everything if you're new to korean food!  Personally though soondoobiijigae (soft tofu soup) is always my favorite but the donkatsu kimbab is awesome as well! 

Would definitely come here more often!"}
{"text":"You want to eat Korean? Check. Cheap? Check. In downtown Montreal? Check. Have you ever heard of Kantapia???

If your answers are all \"yes\", then come! If you already know this place, then you should come back! This little restaurant is 100% Korean (I think... based on my hearing skills by comparing the staff's Korean to Korean shows that I watch...) Price is cheap, so lots of students here! Not lots of space though, so be careful and come sooner! Or just good luck! Food is good! Something that you would expect out of a small restaurant! And yes there is kimchi served!"}

{"text":"I was in Montreal for business and was craving some serious Korean food.  Living in Los Angeles, I have pretty high standards when it comes my peeps cuisine.  I was very happy to have found Kantapia.  The place was decorated very well (Korean style), it was packed with many customers, and the service was fast.  I believe this place was only open for three weeks when I went.

I ordered the soon tofu chigae (hot soft tofu stew), haemool pajun (seafood pancake), and daeji bulgogi (spicy pork).  Yes, I ate all three.. i was hungry.  My favorite was the spicy pork and soft tofu stew.  The marinade was just right and spices were perfect.  The seafood pancake was more of an egg omelet and the scallions were a bit big, so it wasn't the typical seafood pancake style, but it was still good regardless.

After my meal, I had a nice conversation with the owner's daughter (who was very cute by the way) and learned more about Montreal and the Korean community.  Overall, it was a great dining experience and I'd recommend this place without any hesitation.  I was pleasantly surprised to find such an authentic Korean restaurant in Montreal.  Kantapia is a must try!"}
{"text":"Had the soondubu, It hit the spot considering it was below zero outside- I ordered a pork version but got a seafood one instead/ overall not bad however its missing the flavor and level of intensity of spiciness found in general Korean restaurants- served with a wild rice and kimchi (wish they had oi muchim) ; ordered beef boiled dumplings, insides were cold - my girlfriend ordered the galbi which she liked, place is very affordable, its quite small however the staff is nice, worth visiting while you're in montreal."}
{"text":"We were tired after a day travelling around Montreal, and this place had good reviews and was very close to our hotel, so we came. However, the food was quite disappointing. Regular Kimbap had little flavor outside of the pickle. The pork tofu soup was also a bit lacking in flavor outside of being a little spicy. The bibimbap didnt have the most outstanding flavor on its own, and still mediocre with the sauce. The boiled dumplings were literally worse than frozen dumplings you can buy at the grocery store. The service wasnt anything amazing, either."}
{"text":"Good little Korean place not too far from Quartier des Spectacles. We didn't wait at all to get a table on lunch hours. Took a little while to put in our order but given the fact that they were busy, it's understandable. We ordered four plates to share. Fried mandu, Korean seafood pancake, tuna kimbap and chicken gangjeon. The only downside was the fact that the pancake batter was still quite undercooked and that even though I asked to have the chicken made spicy, it wasn't at all. Service was pleasant and fast. We'll have to come back and try their main dishes next time."}
{"text":"Resto rapide, nourriture en bas de 10$. Pas vraiment de goût dans la nourriture, petite portion, la.majorité sont épicé, probablement pourquoi il n'y s aucun goût. Perso, On dirait un resto pour étudiant sans argent. Aller chez ganadara à place."}
