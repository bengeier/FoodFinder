{"text":"I've wondered for a long time why restaurants serve such mediocre breakfasts when it is so simple to make really good ones. Here's the place I've been waiting for! Locally sourced, high quality and delish food! We had the pancakes, with REAL maple syrup no less, bacon and sausages. Yummy cakes! I consider myself to be a bacon aficionado and this bacon did not disappoint. Piggy perfection. As were the sausages....plump pork goodness. The wait staff were cheery and helpful and it's clean as a whistle. We will be back often for breakfast AND lunch."}
{"text":"Country place cafe is a very unique place to eat in that all of the food is hand crafted by someone who actually cares about how food tastes. Texas road house, Olive Garden, red lobster, and other places of the like are good, but their food isn't grown locally and it's filled with unhealthy preservatives and msgs. All of the food served at country place is FRESH, it doesn't sit around, and whenever possible grown locally. I live in evansville, and whenever possible, go to country place. I've gotten the tenderloin steak sandwich multiple times and its never failed. The Friday fish fry is also awesome. This place is definitely worth checking out. If your pallet is limited to greasy flavorless bar burgers and fries, maybe this place isn't for you. This is real food people!!! Oh, don't forget the breakfast!"}
{"text":"terrible, would not recommend going here to anyone, they dont have hashbrowns for breakfast, they dont give you american fries after 11am, so you get to eat french fries with your eggs? who does this?  have done 2 carry-out orders and both times they have screwed it up. i will not be going there again, i will drive to mcfarland or oregon for my sunday breakfast."}
{"text":"Had breakfast today and it was tasty.  However, plan a few more minutes into your scheduled visit here.  There was one waitress on duty and she was having difficulty attending to the 9 a.m. rush. (about 6 tables). Our second cup of coffee was barely warm.  Food / flavor made up for it.  We'll be back."}
{"text":"Number one place to go for breakfast in Dane County if you haven't been here it's a must Cook is amazing very friendly and the French toast is the best in the state!!! Every meal I've had the has been absolutely perfect the staff was very friendly and helpful"}
{"text":"Friendly and attentive service, high quality food and great menu secections make this place a winner.  Finally a resturant in Brooklyn!!"}
{"text":"Great place.  Friendly staff, friendly owner.  They are very kid friendly and take the time to talk to you.  The eggs and french toast are awesome!  Reasonable prices.  Love looking at farmland while I eat!"}
{"text":"The usually reliable Yelp let us down with this restaurant. As mentioned in previous reviews the owners are friendly and care about thier customers. Maybe neighborhood friends pumping the ratings.But ultimately its about the food and we received a big greasy serving of disapointment. We were encouraged to order the turkey reuben it was promised to be \"fantastic\". I noticed the menu stated cole slaw instead of saurekraut, just assumed it would be german cole slaw, caroway seeds without mayo...silly me. I also assumed the sandwich would be served on rye, instead of a tasteless whitebread. They used the reuben cooking method buttered the bread and put it on the grill. So the whitebread soaked up the butter and the heated slaw mayo melted converted the sandwich into greasebomb. I just wrote it off as a creative reuben experiment that went bad. But what was inexcusable were the undercooked french fries. It was obvious the fryer wasn't hot enough the turned soggy and soaked. I did mention to the waitress the fries were unedible and suggested they turn up the heat on fryer. I'm hoping my poor experience was due to inconsistancy and not incompetence. Will try again in the near future to find out."}
{"text":"We tried Holstein's this morning on the recommendation of some friends and WOW.  It is a little treasure box of flavor.  The french toast (ok it is not called french toast, but I can't remember what it was called) was good enough for me to steal off of my husband's plate.  I would go back just for that.  The vegetable omelet was stuffed with fresh cooked vegetables, local cheese and an amazing pesto.    The staff was friendly and very helpful explaining not only the menu options, but where the ingredients were locally sourced.    Chef Scott came out and talked with us for a few minutes.  It was easy to see he has a passion for serving fabulous food.  It was an awesome breakfast and we cannot wait to go back for the friday night fish fry or Lunch."}
{"text":"I have been here a handful of times in a six month period for breakfast and our family has enjoyed it every time. French toast, sausage and egg combinations like no other, simply amazing. The added plus is that while I'm supporting a small local business, I'm also supporting local farms. Excellent quality and prices."}
{"text":"Menu, ingredients and final product are outstanding! All local meats, cheeses and veggies make for exceptional fare.  It is absolutely worth your drive to Holstein (new name) in Brooklyn.  The server was well informed, the chef came out and shot the culinary breeze- really cool place with A+ fare."}
{"text":"4.5 wish they had better fresh cut fries with their outstanding burgers and sandwiches.  Of they would have had fresh cut fries.... I would have scored a 5!  The burger was huge, tasted of real beef covered in cheese and juicy as the best burgers in the Madison area.   Chicken sandwich my partner had gobbled without a breath in between.  I will be back for breakfast!  Only other request is for a website with a menu and a more clearly printed menu.  It was difficult to read without really concentrating (this is just small stuff).  Wish these guys were in Verona, it's just what our town needs."}
{"text":"Outstanding food, friendly staff and killer breakfast. This place is next level and deserves way more attention than it gets, but I am content to not have to wait in line to get in. Best breakfast I've ever had. You won't be disappointed, regardless of what you order."}
