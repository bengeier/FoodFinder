{"text":"This is an amazing & authentic French bakery! I drive to Lawrenceville most Sunday mornings just to hit this place up as soon as they open. They have croissants, fresh bread, all sorts of pastries, quiche & a variety of French sandwiches - everything is incredible and truly French. I take people there all the time & they literally can't believe how good the food is. It reminds me of my summer in Paris. They only have two tiny tables inside though, so don't bank on being able to eat there. But you can take your haul home, sit on your back deck & enjoy a French brunch. J'adore La Gourmandine!"}
{"text":"This place has become a part of my weekend routine.  We've had their croissants, sandwiches, and several other dessert type things (eclairs, mousse).  They are affordable and a nice change of pace from the weekday bagel from some chain downtown.  Their coffee is pretty tasty, too.  A welcome addition to Lawerenceville!"}
{"text":"i live right around the corner... the joys of being able to pick up a fresh, authentic baguette cannot be underestimated.  their breads are delicious and pastries lovely.  i've ordered assortments for work and they're always a hit.  getting there earlier is better, especially on saturdays, as i've seen the line start to snake out the door."}
{"text":"My opera wasn't rich and sweet at all. I just wasted 3.75."}
{"text":"One day I got bored and I decided to go on a mini self-guided tour of Pittsburgh bakery (I went to Vanilla pastry studio, La Gourmandine Bakery and Jean-Marc Chatellier's French Bakery.)

 I got there in the afternoon and by that time most of their stuff was gone already,  I was disappointed, however, I really enjoyed what I got. I got this square chocolate shell thing filled with chocolate mousse, crunch caramel and something else inside. It was DELICIOUS. I wish I got there earlier and got to try other stuff from that place. Ladies at the counter was super nice not that it would've matter if she was being rude cuz I was busy stuffing my face with the deliciousness. Overall, really enjoyed this place."}
{"text":"The ham and cheese and the prosciutto and pickle sandwiches are amazing!"}
{"text":"La Good, man! It was all fantastic! It was nice to feed a family of four for under $20 bucks. Food, coffee, service, and price are all 5 stars! Standing room only if you're looking for a sit down place. Didn't take pics or remember the names of everything so try one savory and one sweet(I had an eclair and pistache). So maybe two sweets and you will be happy all day:)"}
{"text":"By far, the best pastries, desserts and sweets in Pittsburgh. They have the best and only true eclairs I have tried in the U.S. and I am a great fan of them! Hope they would open more hours but I guess the owners have to be there to keep it is this good and they need a break."}
{"text":"I'm guilty of making fun of places for being \"the best of Pittsburgh\". By that I mean it's the best of Pittsburgh but not even close to being the best I've had or the best in any other major city. 

THIS IS NOT ONE OF THOSE PLACES.
Every morsel of food from here has pleased me greatly!"}
{"text":"Delicious treats! This is amazing quality with different bread, pastries, and desserts. They also serve sandwiches which are fantastic!!!

Expect to wait in line if you go on the weekend. But oh so worth the wait!"}
{"text":"There are way better choices for French baked goods in the area such as Jean-Marc Chatellie in Millvale and Gaby et Jules in Squirrel Hill. The sweet bread/tea loaf that we purchased was extremely dry and quite frankly, I could have done better with a Bundt cake. Something must be working as there are always lines on the weekend. Last time for me though."}
{"text":"A Pittsburgh gem. Wonderful pastries, bread and coffee. Possibly the best pastries in Pittsburgh. Very affordably priced too."}
{"text":"La Gourmandine is amazing.  The owner has brought a touch of France to Lawrenceville.  Serving crusty bread, custard like quiche and wonderful lemon tarts...how could you go wrong?  If you are visiting on a Saturday make sure to go early because the line can get quite lengthy.  This is by far one of my favorites places to go when I am in Pittsburgh."}
{"text":"Finally I found this amazing French bakery very yummy and friendly staff. But I closes early around 5pm"}
{"text":"Best place to get nice treats and spoil yourself. I feel like princess every time I eat from there. Pastries yummy for breakfast and many options for desert good price"}
{"text":"The macarons here are so awesome. I wish they were nearer to where I am staying so I could eat them everyday. I have tried many flavors, but my favourites are pistachio, lemon and raspberry (the pink one). But all the other flavors are really good too. It's not too sweet and perfectly crispy on the outside and still moist on the inside."}
{"text":"I loved going into this place when I lived in Lawrenceville! The pastries are really good. I love macarons but find them hard to come by, and pretty expensive most of the time. However, I got a giant macaron in here and it was to die for! The place is pretty small but it's got a nice little seating area."}
{"text":"This is my happy place. 

I love their Flan Patissier and the Parfait Chocolat. So much so that I cannot buy one without buying the other. But if I had to pick, I would consider trading in my lovely husband  for a lifetime supply of the Parfait Chocolat. I wouldn't actually do it because somebody has to do the dishes at my house, but I would CONSIDER it for a few seconds. There is something indescribably amazing about bitter chocolate mousse encases a spongy cake and topped with chocolate sauce. 

Everything I have tried here (most of the sweet stuff, haven't tried the bread) is just decadent and lovely. Go. Try. You will not be disappointed ."}
{"text":"Im actually a bit offended that someone gave this place less than a five star review. This place serves what dreams are made of. The staff is super helpful and accommodating. Next time you go, just order one of everything. Yes, everything."}
{"text":"This place has done me wrong: I can no longer bring myself to eat quiche ANYWHERE ELSE because they have done it so perfectly and beautifully RIGHT. It's soft, it's light, it's fluffy, it's buttery... My favorite is the red pepper and goat cheese. The chocolate chip pistachio creme-filled treats are another go-to. But please, get more real plates and silverware! Disposable ones are far too much of a waste!"}
{"text":"Seriously, so fortunate that this is in our neighborhood. Every single morsel I've sampled from this place is perfection. I live for the almond croissants and the brioche.  Also, the cases are so pretty and service is always friendly and swift."}
{"text":"Absolutely amazing. How they are able to make such amazing bread with less than stellar Pittsburgh water is a mystery. The desserts are to die for. I went with the prosciutto sandwich on fresh French bread. One of the best sandwiches I have had and it was only $5.99. I would crawl through 10 miles of broken glass to go back there. It is THAT good. Just go and you will see for yourself."}
{"text":"In sum, consistently fresh delicious baked goods. Come early. It is worth the wait in line. 

I would not be surprised if zombies start appearing on Butler. If I were a zombie, I would dig myself out of the graveyard up the street and grab a nice hot cup of La Prima coffee (that they brilliantly serve) along side buttery, flaky, and scrumptious brioche, pain au chocolat and the quintessential croissant. 

I have been here numerous times, but my favorite visit was this past Saturday morning. This zombie do not like to get up early in the morning. Yet, this Saturday I was able to convince both Jared and I to partake in the goods.

I have not previously had the paris-brest or délice de pistache. However, after reading others recommendations for such and confirming aesthetic appeal, I ordered both. The nerd within felt the need to research these tasty treats. I was impressed by the history in these delights. I came to learn the paris-brest is pastry made to honor the 1981 Paris to Brest race. Hence, the wheel shape of the choux. Naively, I was thinking it would resemble the tire I will be wearing around my waist with the calories I consumed! I much prefer the French history and not my own. Nevertheless, this delightful pastry has all the sweet and playful bubbled texture of most choux, but its cavernous hallowing was not for any cream- but a hazelnut nut kissed one. The hint of roasted hazelnut, an ever so light touch of sweetness, and the richness of the cream. Worth every single calorie. I will wear my tire with pride.

The délice de pistache a demonstration of the magnificence of pistachios not so much a historical precedent as the paris-brest. Choux dressed with a pistachio mousse that supported a thin plate of dark chocolate. The subtle flavoring of the nuts paired with rich fresh mousse and a thin dark chocolate sheeted tier was perfectly balanced in taste. Admittedly, I would have preferred a drizzling of chocolate as opposed to the thin sheet. The sheet made for awkward eating. However, I felt my personal preference may not be an appropriate deduction. 

I also partook in the broiche. I cannot come to this place and leave without broiche. Airy and buttery, flaky and sweet, ahh the broiche! This visit was the first time I managed to contain myself from eating broiche in the car ride home. The broiche was still delicious- even hours later. I only wish I purchased more than one!"}
{"text":"my cousins took me here and i was just blown away. one word to describe their food and that is delicious! i had the tartelettes au citron and it was amazing. i definitely have to come back and try more. your taste buds will feel as if they died and gone to heaven.  so GOOD!"}
{"text":"Cannot believe I haven't written a review of La Gourmandine yet. All you need to know is to get their almond croissants. Amazing! We take all of our houseguests here for the almond croissants, and it is typically one of the highlights of their visits (and we eat well around these parts--I don't starve them). 

If you're thinking of trying a regular croissant or a chocolate croissant, don't. Get the almond croissant instead. You won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Their bread has the French bread sound, if you know French bakery, you know what I am talking about. And I love their pastries, not too sweet, just right texture and right amount of cream, milk, no fake ingredients; I can taste them right away. Good food means start with good and right ingredients, cook them the proper way and the right timing.  La Gourmandine Bakery & Pastry Shop hits all of them, it is a place you will go again and again and never get bored.  But they only have three tables inside, so usually you can only take a to-go."}
{"text":"I love this little French bakery. It is very consistent, everything tastes amazing every time and is executed very well. The lemon tarte is my personal favorite, so delicious."}
{"text":"Many items are phenomenal and fresh here! Almond croissant is my absolute favorite. Just wish the people behind the counter were a bit friendlier."}
{"text":"*****Patisserie et Boulangerie par excellence!***** Very authentic French. ***** The type of pastry shop Pittsburgh needs. Everything is prepared by hand, none of that pre-processed bakery junk. This reminds me of a place in Gordes in the Provence. For the best pickings, go to the shop when they open early in the morning. Their quiches are terrific for breakfast or lunch or coffee break. Tarts and flans are very light. And the sandwiches are savory, none of that fried greasy stuff sold in fast food chains."}
{"text":"My 3 year old loves their crossant..
I ordered a birthday cake Fraisier..it is so good!"}
{"text":"This place is a gem. Stopped in yesterday for some macaroons and a croissant and they were all amazing. By far the best macaroons I've ever had. The croissant was light, fluffy, and buttery.... all-and-all a little slice of heaven."}
{"text":"???????????????????????????????????"}
{"text":"As I finished studying abroad in Paris for 4 months last spring, one of the hardest things I knew I would have to part with were the pain au chocolats. I literally DIED when I followed the reviews on here to this lovely bakery, and have been going back every weekend. Everyone I have taken here has fallen in love with the small yet so parisienne bakery. Their croissants are as similar to the ones in found in the small back streets of paris that you are going to get, the sandwhiches remind me of walks along the Seine, and the customer service is warm and makes you want to come back again. There are 3 small tables (mostly ones for standing) that you can enjoy your croissant, sandwhich, or coffee at while you listen to the owners speak french (along with the different languages of the customers stopping by). There is quite the foot traffic in this small bakery, so go early on the weekends or risk a small selection!
Overall, this place is making the aching in my heart a little less, so if you have studied in France, read about France, dreamed about France, or are just curious about french pastries, PLEASE go to this bakery!"}
{"text":"Give me all of the pastries. Chocolate hot dogs, especially. I want to swan dive into a pool of raspberry macarons and eat my way to the bottom."}
{"text":"We got the massive raspberry and cream filled macaron. It was almost as big as a sandwich. The cream was the perfect filling between the two macaron discs with fresh, tart raspberries cutting through the filling. We wished we could have tried more. We will be back!!"}
{"text":"We loved the fresh pastries and sandwiches. 
The chocolate eclair reminded me of Paris."}
{"text":"Pretentious.So, I am trying to buy a cake, and I ask her what other cakes can she suggest other than choc mousse cake, her reply is \"Sorry we are very busy right now\". If you have opened a bakery and you are not able to handle your customers, may be you might want to hire another employee rather than insulting your customers. I understand that you are cost cutting and your goal is to get more money from customers, but no need to be so desperate about it. This is Pittsburgh and not France first of all,   and I have lived in Paris for 3 months, and never had an actual French person  behave with me this way, no matter how busy they were. Seriously? And, honesty, their French baguette tastes like crap as compared to the real thing. People buy it because probably there is o other option in Pittsburgh and its what is making these bakery people so complacent and full of themselves. Yuck."}
{"text":"I've been coming to this shop for almost as long as they've been in business -- and I'm so glad they're now around to stay!  Few places in Pittsburgh have pastries this good.  I buy bread when I'm there (baguette, any kind of rustic bread too), but I make the trip for their tarte tatin, which you have to order special, in advance.  Have eaten their pain au chocolate (chocolate croissant), brioche, pastries with pistachio, all manner of fabulous deliciousness.  I know they've recently opened another place in Mt. Lebo, which means, I hope, they're here to stay!"}
{"text":"Once every semester, I take the hour long bus ride from Oakland to Lawrenceville in order to treat myself to La Gourmandine.

The routine goes something like this:
I wake up early on a Saturday morning (11 am). I get on the bus at noon, and I arrive at La Gourmadine at 1 pm. I wait in line for 15 minutes (because there is ALWAYS a line). And then I order six croissants.

That's right. Six.

And I eat them all in one day.

Its a day of pure bliss. The next day is filled with regret. And a trip to the gym. But it's always worth it.

The croissants are flaky and delicious. The brioche is just the right amount of sweet, but not too much!

Treat yourself to La Gourmandine. You won't be disappointed. However, be sure to have somewhere else to go once you pick up your lovely pastries - they have no seating."}
{"text":"I stopped by around 1 pm on a Saturday, and although it wasn't busy, there seemed to always be at least two or three people in the store. The staff were friendly and knowledgeable about the pastries in the case. I got a délice de pistache and a raspberry macaron, which totaled under $5.

I ate the macaron in the small park across the street, and it was delightful. The outside of the shell was crisp, but the inside just melted in my mouth. The filling was nice and tart, but a little too sweet for my taste. I enjoyed the délice de pistache the next morning. It's basically pistachio cream and chocolate chips sandwiched in soft choux pastry. The creamy filling tasted more of lemon than pistachio to me, and it had a crunch from pistachio bits. The chocolate was hard to taste in the cream. I wasn't really a fan of the texture from the nuts, but overall, I enjoyed the pastry.

I'll definitely be back to try some other things when I'm in the area!"}
{"text":"This morning there was a line out the front door and there's a reason for that: everything is really good. There are a few tables but mainly the shop is set up for buying pastries, quiche, bread and sandwiches to take away. 

They have a building permit in the window, which is good because it means they are expanding, and I overheard someone behind the counter say that they are maybe opening on Sundays. The neighborhood, right on the line between central and upper Lawrenceville, is fast becoming the most vibrant area of Pittsburgh so it's easy to see why this place is thriving."}
{"text":"Best bakery in Pittsburgh. Don't go there if you're looking for a dozen chocolate cookies or some sugary thumbprints and expecting something similar to the edibles at your local Giant Eagle, but this place has the best pastries and best croissants I have had in years."}
{"text":"As many others have said , worth going for almond croissants. The quiche and pastries are also top notch. Be sure to get there early when they open on Saturdays."}
{"text":"OMFG!! we just had the best quiche in the world....it was so eye rolling in the back of your head excellent....i love this place so much!!!!! U will find me there every Saturday or Sunday...or both days....LOL!!"}
{"text":"This place is great.  I got a long stick of bread with cured pig meet in it and some tiny gherkins.  The desserts looked good too but I was too embarrassed to ask what any of them are.  I call 46th and Butler Little Paris because of that and that French jukejoint Partiern's on the corner.   Every morning when I walk by it smells like I'm on a tandem bicycle on the banks of the Seine with Sebastian Tellier.  Highly recommended to all.  J/k never been to Paris but it smells like Europe."}
{"text":"Just the best.  I adore this place.  Very wheelchair friendly and the most incredible bread and pastries.  Not sure that they have an ADA bathroom but then I don't know if they have a BR for customers at all."}
{"text":"I am SOOOOOOOOOO glad that another French bakery has opened in Pittsburgh.  Its competition's same ol' same ol' menu and snooty French attitude are what drove me away from going there.

If you are looking for unique and authentic French delights, this is the place the check out!  They have the best almond croissant and amazing bread....something Jean - Marc does not have!"}
{"text":"Overall, excellent place. I lived in France for almost 10 years and I know my French bread and pastries. The brioche is good (not the best I've had but still solid), the pain au chocolat is also delicious. Pastries are slightly sweet but still 10 times better than the average american pastry. The only disappointment was the baguette - it was far better than what grocery stores call \"baguettes\" but still had a bland quality to it. I think if I had gotten their other baguette (it looked like what the French call \"tradition\") it would've probably been better. I will definitely come back when in the area!!"}
{"text":"The best bakery in the south hills!  We buy bread and desserts here as much as possible. My personal favorite are their almond croissants!"}
{"text":"La Gourmandine is awesome!  I've been here several times now and have loved everything I've tried including their scones, macaroons, and sandwiches.  I particularly like the sandwich and drink combo for lunch for $6.50.  They have 4-5 options for the sandwich, all of which come on a fresh baguette.  My favorite is the prosciutto.  There can be a line at times and I think the minimum for credit card purchases is $5."}
{"text":"This is the best bakery in all of Pittsburgh. They aren't just filled with sweets like most bakeries, it's filled with delicious, savory pieces of excellent food!  The price is cheap for what you get and the quality is amazing! This place is so nice and cozy, it's so relaxing to go in, get a baguette sandwich, a drink and dessert and sit outside while enjoying the excellent food.  If I lived closer, I would go broke because I would be there everyday if I could.

I think this is the best place for the best-tasting, most authentic French food for a brunch/lunch meal.  Highly recommend! I tell everyone I know about it."}
{"text":"If I could give this little bakery 10 stars, I would. The most elegantly constructed pastries Pittsburgh has to offer, good breads, rich quiches and lovely staff. My friends and I cannot imagine a Saturday morning without a pilgrimage to La Gourmandine. They are a Pittsburgh gem."}
{"text":"This, to me, is what a bakery should be, in every way. I'm not much for sweets, so a serious pâtissier really doesn't matter to me. I like savory pastries, not cakes and macarons. This is just my preference. What they are doing at Gaby et Jules is lovely, but it's not my thing. 

This place? This is where it's at. Especially for lunch. The sandwiches and bread here are delicious. It's so nice to have something so steeped in European tradition right there on Butler street. All the care and nuance that comes with artisinal baking, none of the smug, 'I'm doing you a favor' attitude that one often finds in Lawrenceville. Everything is beautiful. The only caveat is get there early. They run out of things, because everything is made fresh."}
{"text":"Out of 5:
3.5 - Croissant: delicate and airy
3.5 - Almond Croissant: crunch almonds, not overpowering light filling"}
{"text":"This bakery is the only bakery I go to in Mt Lebanon, after trying them all.  Everything is delicious, and I can actually attest to \"everything\" there.  If you are going to splurge on a sweet, make it a great one from this place."}
{"text":"Wow!   Having sampled pastries while in Paris, I have to say La Gourmandine is unsurpassable.  The lemon tart is unbelievable as are the creme puffs and eclairs au chocolate.   The marquise is fabulous.  My husband and I had breakfast  and enjoyed an abricotine (Danish doesn't begin to describe this delectable pastry) and \"melt in your mouth \" feta and roasted red pepper quiche.  Can't wait to return!"}
{"text":"My family purchased some pastries.  And, my husband wanted some additional croissants , but the lady with the dark hair, who i believe is part owner of the business, was coughing and coughing everywhere! She barely  covered her mouth, and was standing right over the uncovered pastries!  My husband changed his mind pretty quick. Thank goodness the other stuff was already in bagged and she didn't wait on us! This was the last week of  December 2017.  Considering you work in a food business, and if you have a cough that bad, you shouldn't be around food!  Very disappointed! This was the Mt. Lebanon location."}
{"text":"Their almond croissants are to die for. Everything in their pastry section is great. The bakery is also great. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"This place is fantastic.  My daughter needed to take French food to her Fun in France class for school.  Like the slacker parents we are, we forgot until late the night before.  A 7:30am call to La Gourmandine was all it took to send fabulous French food into the school.  They got us plenty of food within our budgeted range.  So glad to have this place in our neighborhood!"}
{"text":"I have to start off by stating the disclaimer I'm not a huge pastry fan but with a place like this I may have a new food group added to my diet. I came here on a Sunday morning and I was contemplating moving on as I drove by and witnessed a line coming out the door of this place, but that also intrigues me a bit and so I  found it necessary to see what the heck was going on. The smells billowing out the door drew me in as the line was moving quite fast with a very good system of helping people get what they wanted. Before I knew it I was up to the counter and a jumble of words came out of my mouth of everything I wanted to try a baguette, apricot thingy danish, chocolate chip croissant thingy, and omg is that a cream puff. Well they all ended up in a bag for me. I thought to myself what have I done but when the cashier rang me up it only cost me $8.50, I don't know if they screwed something up but that is one heck of a deal. Everything was very tasty and the Cream puff was such a nice treat since I haven't seen one of those in the Burgh in ages. I highly suggest you get yo tail down here and check out all the goodies for yourself."}
{"text":"Chocolate is very rich and also almond croissant is to die for. It is amazing and great"}
{"text":"Everything here is knock your socks off insanely good. Its the kind of food that makes your eyes roll into the back of your head and you could die happy if this was your last meal. Try everything. Everything is amazing. Really go there now. I want my ashes dumped in front of this store when I die."}
{"text":"Love the sandwiches and my favorite pastry has to be the raisin one. Im pretty sure they sell those in heaven. Very good pumpkin pastry as well. One of my favorite spots in pittsburgh."}
{"text":"They're pretty good.  I recommend buying a sandwich and some pastries and taking them for a picnic across the street in allegheny cemetery.  Be aware that there is often a line and that they often run out of things.  However they also sell things at a reduced price before closing time."}
{"text":"My first and last stop on every trip to Pittsburgh. I came here not 72 hours after returning from a week long trip in Paris, and the Parisian sandwich, pain au chocolate and baguettes were better than we had in Marais."}
{"text":"I LOVE this bakery. Everything is so fresh and high quality - my favorite is the raspberry macaron or the lemon tart. Honestly you're going to get a fantastic tasting pastry regardless of what you order, but I find the ones that include fruit are always the best to me just because the fruit is super fresh."}
{"text":"Although this place is so far away from my apartment and it has a weird schedule, it is still my favorite bakery in Pittsburgh! Everything is heavenly good!!!
They have several kinds of croissants/pastries, which are great with a latte. My personal favorite is the chocolate one. For desserts, I would definitely recommend the Opera cake. It has this perfect balanced sweetness and not too dense like in some other places. What surprise me most is their sandwiches. They taste much better than they look, so give it a try!
The staff are very friendly and always pack the delicate desserts in such an assuring way. 
By the way, you can order birthday cake from them too!"}
{"text":"There is a reason this bakery is on the list of Pittsburgh places to try. My daughter and I stopped here for dessert items last Saturday afternoon after eating lunch in Highland Park. We joined the back of the line curving and stretching to just inside the door. We did not hold our place as the end of the line for long. Granted, the sales area of this business is a small space so more than a couple customers requires a line-up. We could not get close to look at all the choices before reaching the counter, but we got some tips and descriptions from the two young men in front of us who were 'regulars'. One young man said he had been there every day the previous summer. So we began to form a list for when it came our turn to order. We ordered the choquettes, (small sugar-covered nuggets described by the one young man as donut holes made from croissant dough). Then we selected a chausson aux pommes. My daughter liked this a lot, but I prefer slices or chunks of apples rather than a sauce. Finally it was our turn to select from all those beautiful, mouth-watering temptations in the display case. We chose the charlotte aux framboises, the super-sized macaron framboise, the scrumptious tropezienne, and a couple of equally delicious lemon macarons. What was the favorite? It is impossible to choose just one item, and there are many more things to sample before deciding on favorites. We returned this Saturday for repeat purchases. As we got out of the car, I could see the line was out on the street this time. It was worth the wait for the macaron framboise , tropezienne, and this time we added the tarte aux citron, abricotine, brioche aux agrumes, tarte tatin and a small baguette. We plan to keep going back until we have tried everything. Then perhaps we can narrow down our favorites, walk right in and order that one favorite. Or maybe we will always walk out with a box filled with several selections ."}
{"text":"I had a sample of the flan pâtissier, which was not too sweet and a little on the firm side. I chose to buy a zephyr and a dozen of mini chouqhettes instead. The mini chouquettes I got happen to be straight out of the oven, so it was so heavenly. The zephyr was tart and not too sweet at all. The marzipan mixture was perfect to offset the tartness of the raspberry. In general, all of their baked goods are freshly made, light, and fluffy. Would recommend to anyone who enjoys baked goods."}
{"text":"I had the quiche which they had to warm up (microwave) so parts were hot, parts were cold. I probably should've gotten there earlier for this but what can you do. That is the only reason this place does not get five stars. 

On to the good stuff: the eclair was one of the best I've ever tasted. Fluffy, light, savory: everything you want out of an eclair was there. Still think about it to this day. My girlfriend got a prosciutto and pickle sandwich on a French baguette which soon became her favorite sandwich. 

The bear claw- like item was also delicious. It's an awesome little locally owned bakery. I don't know why you would go anywhere else. It is quintessential lawerenceville and that's awesome."}
{"text":"Listen: I'm just going to cut to the chase. If heaven had a bakery, I'm pretty confident it would be La Gourmandine.

I've been dying to come here for ages now, and I'm kicking myself for not coming sooner. When I walked in, I was greeted immediately and everyone was very friendly. It felt just the way a bakery should feel: quaint, homey, and it smelled wonderful.

I was immediately skeptical when I entered the bakery, however, because the girl behind the counter was really skinny and pretty. I typically don't trust bakeries with skinny employees. But not to worry, this place is legit, I promise. Obviously, everything looked amazing so I asked the girl there for some recommendations. She basically recommended everything and then said, \"Oh, how could I forget about the cream puff!\" I pretty much so wanted to ask if she wanted to be best friends on the spot, but instead replied, \"Yeah, I'll take one of those, too.\"

I left the bakery with 5 huge pastries because I obviously couldn't decide on just two. I apologize to my already non-existent waistline. I was trying to get things for my better half and I to enjoy together this weekend, but he's still at work and I can make no promises that there will be any left by the time he makes it home.

As I was checking out, my new BFF said, \"Oh, you should come back here earlier in the day, we have twice the selection!\" I'm literally glad I didn't come earlier in the day, or I probably would have left with 10 pastries. But tomorrow morning? Well, maybe I'll go back tomorrow morning."}
{"text":"They will soon be open on Sundays, too, according to their Facebook page! \"Beginning May 12th, Mother's Day, we will be open Saturdays and Sundays from 9:00am to 2:30pm. We hope to see you there!\""}
{"text":"I wished I lived here. In the store.
I arrived in the afternoon so there weren't a lot of things left but still plenty. I had the famous almond croissant, lemon tart, and a lunette.
The almond croissant was as good as everyone says it is- especially after heated up for a few minutes- buttery layers, crunchy yet soft bite, and sweet, sweet almond fillings.
The lemon tart was not too sour not too sweet, just right- and the dollop of cream on top complimented it so finely.
The lunette cookie was a big round cookie with powder sugar on top and jam filling inside- heavenly!
I will buy a lot more next time I come back!"}
{"text":"So happy to see this place in my hood. Their almond croissant is too good for words and the service is always great. Cannot recommend enough."}
{"text":"I'm completely obsessed with this bakery! 

I've eaten delicious, fluffy , buttery items from this place a few days in a row already. My aunt has been so gracious and had a variety available at her home where we have been staying. But today I went in to see what else they have.

They've got pastries , cute little desserts , even sandwiches. The sandwiches looked really good! I regret not trying one. I did get a raspberry macaroon which was more soft than crunchy and it was good although  I prefer crunchy. I ordered one of those large raspberry macaroons but I haven't tried it yet. We also ordered one of those cream puffs. 

And of course we bought a few more pastries for the road. 

No regrets!

Ps. Service was great! Everyone was friendly and polite"}
{"text":"It is by far the greatest turkey sandwich of all time ... turkey lettuce tomato cheese and mustard ... so what makes it spectacular. ... the roll that it is on.  

My family never makes it home with a full baguette or loaf of bread .... Hunks are missing from the commute home .... you just have to rip off a hunk and eat it.  The smell is like a siren's song.

The almond croissants. ... are sticky delightful sinful pasteries.  

Only downfall ... they do not take American Express. 

Stop in the soap shop next door ... lots of good smells too."}
{"text":"I would give five stars but one item is not there to validate that rating.  The missing item is the Epi.  An Epi is the sister to the baguette but differs in that before baking the dough is snipped on both sides of the loaf resulting in a bread that resembles a stem with leaves going up on each side.
Their explanation to us was that they moved their baking to another location and that the ovens are not able to make the Epi.  My question is....if you can bake a Baguette, why can't you bake an Epi?
The bakery is fantastic, great and every other exemplary adjective.  Having been to three others in the city, I would say that their product is, by far, the best in quality and taste, their pricing is reasonable.  One \"French\" bakery sells 500 types of macarons and calls themselves a French Bakery.  When I was there I asked what a certain bread was that was for sale and I was told....french!  Brilliant!
I always return to LaGourmandine.
But please, please, please figure out this oven business as those Epis were the absolute best.  Even my second favorite, the almond croissant, doesn't hold a candle to that enticing loaf!"}
{"text":"I have been excited about trying La Gourmandine since it opened and I finally got to go try it this morning for breakfast.  All I can say is wow!  I was so impressed and pleased with my experience that I can't wait to go back for more.  I bought an almond croissant and coffee ($3 total) and a baguette for later ($2).  The croissant was fantastic and the coffee was very tasty.  The baguette was just as perfect (with cheese for lunch).  Great little bakery, keep it coming!!"}
{"text":"Amazing. get the almond cream croissant! i think its cash only.. but worth every penny."}
{"text":"The pastries....amazing. I stopped in and ordered an assortment for work, and they were all delicious. The inside is small and there was a line, but the pace was fast, so know what you want before you go in, or step back. Everything was beautifully presented and labeled.  The back of the bakery is lined with beautiful artisan breads. My favorite was the almond croissant and the pistachio eclair.  I would go broke if I were left to my own device in this shop.  It is pricey, but you get what you pay for, and you leave with great quality products.  I will definitely be returning, I have desserts I left behind and breads I would like to try.   What a gem to the area!"}
{"text":"I went on a La Gourmandine splurge in the last week of my pregnancy (literally the day leading up to delivery). I had made my tour of Pittsburgh and already visited the Mt. Lebanon shop.  This one was new to me--located in what is now a more trendy Lawrenceville from what I remembered.  We easily found street parking (unmetered) on a Friday morning, after an appointment in Pittsburgh.  The store was busy, but not overly crowded. It feels about the same space as Mt. Lebanon's but the setup contributes to a \"larger\" feel.  The counter forms an L, and we were at the croissants, before greeted by a friendly employee.  There were a few couples set up at tables in the front of the store.  We left with sandwiches, bread, eclairs, and both chocolate and almond croissants.  The slightly sweet cocoa mixed in with sweetened croissant dough was too much for me, and I'll stick to my almond croissants.  But, as usually, everything is carefully and loving crafted, delicious, and worth the money.  It can get a little expensive but that's the price of La Gourmandine's meticulous craft.  Love it."}
{"text":"The pastries are the closest to a French bakery that I have experiences in this city. Many delicious things to choose from !"}
{"text":"Lovely! Went in at 9AM sharp as soon as they opened. Tried the butter,almond and chocolate croissants. All so fresh and delicious. Very good! must try!"}
{"text":"My significant others got some \"tartelettes\" (little pies) from there a few days ago: total winner. I highly recommend their pear tarte, their lemon pie, and the raspberry pie. Being French, I am also happy to bring the seal of cultural authenticity!"}
{"text":"La Gourmandine is my favorite bakery. I would argue it is THE best bakery in U.S.-- and I even lived in NYC and SF and I think it is better than anything I went to there. 

Their almond croissants are my ultimate favorite, but honestly everything is delicious. I usually get their tuna sandwich and ask them to add cheese & veggies to it. I have never been disappointed and recommend the bakery to everyone I know!"}
{"text":"Phenomenal pastries!  Their croissants are melt in your mouth buttery soft.  I especially love that they offer traditional French Christmas desserts.  Bring a box of their goodies to any occasion and your friends will love you!"}
{"text":"Amazing little authentic patisserie in hipster Lawrenceville. People waiting at the door for it to open on Sunday!"}
{"text":"WOW.

I never thought I would be so impressed with something as simple as a lemon tart or a hazelnut puff pastry, but La Gourmandine is solely responsible for spoiling my appetite for dinner.  I jumped straight to the dessert and sat on the couch with mixed feelings of satisfaction and disappointment in my inability to restrain myself and wait to eat the delicious desserts until after dinner.  Oh well!"}
{"text":"Wow... Great place... Finally a true French pastry shop in the south hills... For those who want to complain about a wait and wanting to go GE to get there \"baguette\" please continue to do so it only means not for those of us who appreciate true craftsmanship..."}
{"text":"A nice French bakery in Lawrenceville. First time trying the almond croissant and chouquetttes"}
{"text":"I stopped in around 1pm on a Friday afternoon. Parking was not bad at this time. The people there were friendly and the baked goods were amazing even after sitting in my car for 3 hours."}
{"text":"Astoundingly good.  Every single pastry I bought was flawless (much better than anything I could ever get in New York City).  In addition, the \"Parisienne\" sandwich I bought was one of the best sandwiches I've had, period.  It's base was a baguette that was better than any I've had outside of France.  A true marvel.  Don't ever change!"}
{"text":"How do the French stay so thin?!  I stopped in here today and tried the eclair.  OMG.  Out of this world!"}
{"text":"I am not really a pastry guy.  But this place could make me a convert, should I ever recover from my phobia of developing man-bewbs.  It takes a ton of discipline to not go here every single weekend.  But to be fair, it makes it all the much better when I do.  Now, I've been here twice, and I really try to review a place after being there more than once.  I have walked past dozens of times, and every time there is a line.  But the line moves pretty fast, and the staff is extremely friendly.  If you are into food porn, this place is the equivalent of being a thirteen year old boy and seeing your first dirty mag (I realize this reference is antiquated, so any millenials reading this can simply ignore and continue reading).  These pastries are \"crafted\" in the most literal sense of the word.  Immaculate chocolate ribbons, silver dusted sugar, brightly colored icing, the works.  But it's not all appearance.  These treats are pretty amazing (and not in the \"I'm a 16 year old girl describing my new boyfriend\" amazing), in the truest definition.  It's no coincidence that you will hear multiple languages of customer's waiting in line, as the fare here seeks to unite people's of all backgrounds (save for diabetics).  There's no seating, save for the one table outside.  But no matter, just go across the street and there are benches, or go to the cemetery which is actually pretty nice (and the dead are fearful of pastry, so enter with no fear).  Definitely check this place out and trust your eyes, as they will not betray your tastebuds (unlike those seemingly delicious berries and mushrooms you find in the forest, which could kill you and you'd be at fault because of Darwin and whatnot).

IF THIS PLACE WERE A MUSICIAN/BAND:   Queen-Flamboyance and decadence normally overcompensate for lack of talent, but Queen backed it up with quality work."}
{"text":"Outstanding. Very clean interior. Presentations are very important here. The baked goods are identical and perfect every day and all day. Nothing sloppy. Amazing quality control. I've liked everything I have tried. Takeout items are packed with care and not thrown in a bag. I usually get one of the baked pastries and a coffee and eat at one of the little tables inside. I haven't tried the bread yet but I intend to. I would not hesitate to order a cake for the next special occasion. 
Sometimes the staff don't always seem engaging. It's hard to see their faces through the tall display case perhaps. 
You definitely need to know French as all the descriptions are in French. It makes it difficult to order or to know what the ingredients are. You usually have to ask or guess."}
{"text":"The pastries are works of art .... We almost hate to bite into them since they are all so beautiful. The croissants are delicious also. I have suggested this bakery to numerous friends and EVERYONE has been impressed with the beauty and quality. A true GEM!"}
{"text":"The croissants and eclairs are to die for! I would highly recommend this little bakery for breakfast/brunch."}
{"text":"Oh my! This place is great!

My girls and I went on a sunny Saturday morning this past Summer. Surprisingly the line wasn't out the door. We were all overwhelmed by the variety of choices from such a small space. The pastries are out of this world! The Pain au chocolat ou Chocolatine (Flaky pastry with chocolate barres.) is without a doubt my favorite pastry that they offer. They also offer danishes, croissants, individual little pastries, cakes, tarts and so much more. Everything I tried was delicious. They also offer coffee that goes perfect with the pastries they offer. The space is small with only a few tables to sit at so I would suggest getting your stuff to go. 

Their sandwiches are also delicious. The fresh French baguette really makes the sandwich. The Le Parisien (French baguette with butter, ham, and Swiss cheese) was my favorite.

The people seem happy working there, are patient while waiting for you to make your choices and greet you with a smile. 

If you are ever in the area, THIS PLACE IS A MUST STOP!"}
{"text":"My favorite bakery! I have yet to get something from here that hasn't been fantastic. The weekend mornings can get a little crowded, but it is well worth the wait!"}
{"text":"Best bakery I've ever been to. Love the pear custard tart and the brie bread. Even the coffee is delicious. Just wish it was open Sundays, because that's my relax and splurge day."}
{"text":"What can I say... fabulous pastries and bread, and all fresh-baked and delicious. Some of my favorites are the Croissant Auux Amades (filled with almond cream and toasted almonds) and the Abricotine (filled with pastry cream and topped with apricots).  Makes me hungry just typing about them.
The custom cakes are masterpieces of taste and looks, though a bit pricier than a Giant Eagle cake....but well worth it for those special birthdays and occasions."}
{"text":"My husband and I make a point to stop in here every Saturday morning or afternoon. Its such a treat to have La Gourmandine on a weekly basis but we can't help ourselves. There's nothing that I've had from La Gourmandine that I haven't liked. Almond croissants, chocolate croissants, apricot pastries, and even sandwiches. Everything is flaky, buttery, and absolutely perfect. I absolutely love that the dessert pastries are sweet, but not overwhelmingly sweet. 

My only complaint is that you kind of have to know what you want when coming in. The workers try to be efficient and get everyone out the door as soon as possible, so that could be a lot of pressure when you're just in awe of all the beautiful options. However, you really could just point randomly at anything in the display case and it be good. You also can't go wrong with any of the items I listed above if you want to go in prepared to spitfire your order. But one bite of a pastry and you can forget all about being rushed to order. 

I will be here again and again and I recommend you do the same! So worth it!"}
{"text":"Everyone raves about this place, the times I have been there were completely disappointing.  The hype is not lived up to. The lines you see waiting in the morning, WHAT ARE THESE PEOPLE WAITING FOR?! I've never had anything at this place I enjoyed.  
Maybe it's picky of me. Maybe I've been spoiled by authentic french bakers. Maybe Jean-Marc just holds my heart too tightly. Maybe I just enjoy being contrary to popular beliefs. Who knows. 
I do know that my taste buds were not excited and decided to take a little nap of their own.  
i guess they LOOK pretty but that's the extent for me. I liked the look but the taste was truly lacking."}
{"text":"I left Pittsburgh over a year ago and I still miss this place. The baguettes are unbelievable - I haven't found anything remotely close in California. I love the sandwiches, especially the ham and cheese (mmmm, butter). We only had a few pastries from here, but they were all divine - the Paris Brest was a particular standout. 

The only thing I'd change is the amount of seating - it would be nice to linger with a pastry and coffee instead of being herded right out into the street with your delectable box o' goodness to go."}
{"text":"Probably the best French bread, pastries on this side of the state of PA.  I used to live in France.  This place is the real deal.  Authentic French bakery.  Nice work!  Oh, and I can always seem to find parking nearby, even on a Saturday morning.  

Pour les nouveaux arrivés français à Pittsburgh, ceci est bien une boulangerie qui vous fera pensez que vous soyez chez vous."}
{"text":"I'll keep it short. This is the only place in Pittsburgh that makes a baguette comparable to those found in boulangeries in Paris. It is a simple fix for someone in need of something authentic."}
{"text":"You know when you try something and you think, \"Well, it was kind of like what I had in (insert name of foreign city).\"  The baked goods at La Gourmandine are EXACTLY like what I ate in France.  I felt like I was back in a patisserie et boulangerie , except no one was mocking my terrible French."}
{"text":"The first thing I ever ate from La Gourmandine was one of their delicious sandwiches on a fresh baked baguette.  I ate it on the floor of my new Lawrenceville home even before the moving truck arrived.

Since then, my wife and I have frequented this bakery often for sandwiches, quiche, and pastries.  You can't go wrong here."}
{"text":"Well, because of La Gourmandine, all I ate last Friday was dessert but sometimes you have to have those kind of days.

Their clafoutis was delicious.  Here in New York, my go to patisserie is Maison Kayer but La Gourmandine is every bit as good.  

I've eaten my way through Paris countless times and I must say that there are few boulangeries/patisseries in the US that are as authentically French as La Gourmandine.

On se verra!"}
{"text":"Deliciously simple delicacies. Love the vegetarian sandwich, minus the raw gums after biting through the thick bread. The store itself is small but is beautiful to look at (and smell)! My boyfriend's sister was in Paris and this place was almost an exact replica of the French bakery and pastry shop she posted a picture of. I'm sure the food here is just about as good as it is there given its French roots. Somewhat pricey, but where else can you get meals and desserts seemingly straight from Europe?"}
{"text":"Incredibly good bread, pastries, and coffee.  The croissants and baguettes are just like what you can buy in France."}
{"text":"Gourmandine is a terrific, reasonably priced, neighborhood French bakery. Almost everything I have gotten from there has been delicious and very reasonably priced. And I've tried most everything in the case, counters, and shelves! The owner is lovely and the staff are usually extremely helpful. They can be a bit curt if the store is very busy, but otherwise are pleasant and quick. The pastries aren't too sweet, and they have enough seasonal things on offer to keep me interested. I especially like their winter Religieuse. In the summer the fresh berries on the Macaron aux Fruits are great, and the cakes are exquisite.

This is a must-eat place, but be sure to show up early if you want the best selection. I find that it comes in waves. On a Saturday or Sunday it is best to arrive either at open or around 11. When I lived in the city I came here almost every week for bread or a treat."}
{"text":"I think they put crack in their almond croissants. They are so addictive. 

Everything here is top notch and we are super fortunate that it is within walking distance."}
{"text":"There's a reason why there is always a line to get to the front counter. The food here is phenomenal. The pastries are all well composed and will surely satisfy that sweet tooth. I'm not much of a sweets fan, but all of the pastries I tried so far from this bakery were divine. The bread here is my new addiction. They're freshly made and will surely fill that \"carbs-full\" lust. My favorite sandwich from here is Le Montagnard with a perfect balance of butter, pickles and prosciutto on a freshly made baguette. My only complaint about this place is how cramped it is. Be prepared to take your food elsewhere because there are only a few seats."}
{"text":"The bad news is that I've just moved within a few blocks of this bakery.  :-)  I absolutely have loved everything I've bought here.  The lemon tarts are especially tasty.  I recently tried the flan and it was exceptional.  Any weight I gain in the next few months will be blamed on La Gourmandine!"}
{"text":"I have to say I'm extremely biased here because this place is just down the street with me. But come on, the owners speak French! Their pastries are incredible. Every time I go I get a few classic eclairs as well as a few more things that I'm unfamiliar with, just for fun. Not once have I ever had something I did not like.

I honestly can't think of anything bad to say about La Gourmandine. It's delicious and everything they make is done that morning. When they're out, they're out, and it's reassuring to go into their bakery right before closing and see that most of the stuff has been snapped up.

Their baguette sandwiches and quiches are also great for breakfast, brunch, or lunch.

I hope some day they get a nice espresso machine and put the cherry on top of an already near perfect establishment. If I can get my eclair with a foamy cafe au lait, I'd be in heaven.

I have a more in-depth article on my website.  http://eatinginpittsburgh.com/2010/06/30/cest-magnifique-la-gourmadine-in-pittsburgh/"}
{"text":"Best French bakery outside France. I have been to others like it but this one takes the quiche. Apart from the workers not speaking French and being rude it's like a bakery I have been to in Paris. But onto the food. The bread is fresh and full or flavor the desserts are amazing. I always go for the flan. But don't forget to pick up a peace of fresh quiche for lunch. I make a good quiche but this one is extra good. There croissants really prove they know what they are doing, flaky, soft and rich. But watch out! If you don't get there early you won't get what you want. When they are out they are out."}
{"text":"OMG!  It's like being in one of best French bakeries.  Seriously.  Everything we got was excellent.  I highly recommend.  This place is definitely worth the hype."}
{"text":"The best! Some of my favorites: Quiches, Almond Croissants, Chocolate Eclairs, and Brie Tarts!  

Very friendly service and beautiful, busy place. 

TIP: Get there early for the best selection, they sell out often!"}
{"text":"Loved this little spot. Fresh baked pastries, cookies, and bread. I tried the Brie tart and it was delicious. I also had a double espresso which wasn't made the traditional way it was also really good. 

It's a good place to stop and grab something to go. There wasn't enough room to be able to sit and enjoy as a large group had taken all the tables and pushed them together. But I will do sure be back to try more!"}
{"text":"The pastries were really delicious. I got a croissant and a chocolate filled croissant and coffee. It was a little disappointing they didn't have a selection of coffee but rather a do it yourself dispenser but it was good nonetheless. The service was excellent and they answered all the customers questions with smiles."}
{"text":"Best quick, reasonably priced, breakfast and lunch to go options in Pittsburgh. I know nothing about \"authenticity\" when it comes to French cuisine, but I've heard this is the real deal from more than a few people. Regardless, it is delicious. And they are nice. And they don't laugh at you if you are trying to practice French pronunciation."}
{"text":"Now I've gone through almost everything they have except bread and sandwich, I still LOVE it. Every time I saved myself one almond croissant from here for breakfast next morning, I go to bed with a sweet smile. They have the best danish and croissant in town to my opinion, creamy and flavorful, but not loaded with sugar."}
{"text":"What to get: any pastry
Service: 4/5
Atmosphere: dessert, cafe, to go
Wait: 0 mins (Tuesday 4PM for 1)
Parking: street

The Experience: [August 2016]
Afternoon snack time? Oh yes! I'm glad this little pastry shop was open this late in the afternoon. That being said, their selection probably wasn't as plentiful as it would be in the morning, but I still was able to go some macarons and the special of the day pastry (totally forgot the name of it).

Parking can be a little strange and tight in the area (that's coming from an out-of-towner), but it can be found within a reasonable walking distance. I think I looped around a bit, but I found something eventually.

I love pastries, so I'd recommend coming here earlier in the day (like the morning) to get the best selection. Cute neighborhood shop :)"}
{"text":"This bakery was everything the Yelpers said it would be and then some. Honestly, after eating there once, I wouldn't have cared if it was in the middle of Homewood, open only in the middle of the night, the pastries were amazing! An added bonus was that their coffee was also delectable. 

Twice in our visit to Pittsburgh we visited, both times with rather large pastry orders, to try and sample the widest variety of pastries possible. I don't really have a sweet tooth, but I have a soft spot for well-made pastry and this place hit the nail on the head. I haven't been to France, so I cannot attest to it's authenticity, but it is the sort of stuff I dream of visiting if I were to ever go to France. 

All of their prices were extremely reasonable, especially given that their goods are baked fresh daily--I was a little shocked actually, at how cheap they were. While I didn't purchase any, their prices on whole cakes and pastries to take home were also extremely reasonable. The service was quick, efficient and pleasant. All of the pastries were not overly sweet, nor did they give you the sort of sugar shock you associate with cheap pastries. (I also purchased a giant box of pastries before leaving town and they traveled remarkably well in the car for eight hours, not getting soggy or melting.)

The chocolate eclair, lemon tart, raspberry tart, croissant, almond filled croissant, chocolate filled croissant, chouquette and cinnamon roll were all to die for delicious. The only pastry I had that I wasn't overly excited about was the raisin pastry, but it was just a little dry and I'm not overly fond of raisins. 

You must, must, must visit if you are in the market for high quality pastries."}
{"text":"The best almond croissant; I crave them!! Everything else is also fresh and delicious, wonderful place!"}
{"text":"One bite of these delicate, buttery, delicious pastries and I was transported to the heart of Paris. I kid you not. The pain au chocolate, the croissant almondine, the macaron... All so very delicate... All so very sweet... All so very, very French. 

I'm told the owner/baker is himself from France. A transplant to Pittsburgh who made the genius decision to open an amazing, authentic little French bakery in the neighborhood that would most appreciate it. 

The cakes are exquisite. The pastries are gorgeous. They have savory croissant (which I haven't seen anywhere outside of Europe!) and they have lovely little baguete sandwiches. Everything and anything your heart could desire, they have something for you. They do. 

The shop is small, with a few cafe tables and wall art that pays homage to the homeland. When we arrived, there was a line nearly out the door but everyone politely waited for their petit pastries while oogling the other beauties in the case. 

If you find yourself in Pittsburgh, do yourself a favor and make a trip to Lawrenceville if for no other reason than to taste the confectionary treasures from La Gourmandine. It's a helluva lot cheaper than going to Paris, and tastes just as good, I swear."}
{"text":"I stick with my previous review for the rest of the bread, but I finally hit it for breakfast pastries: kick ass!  Easily one of the best croissants I've ever had, and the turnover and cinnamon roll were awesome, too.

Overall assessment:
bread: 4 stars
pastry: 5 stars
mean: 4.5 stars, which rounds to 5

They're friendly, too.  I also think they're giving up a nice chunk of revenue by not being open for take-home pastries on Sunday (hint, hint)."}
{"text":"Better than most places in France.  I love the almond croissant and my wife love the lemon tart - along with everything else.  Come early if you want something popular - before they run out."}
{"text":"Compared to Tartine in SF and Balthazar Bakery in NYC, Gourmandine is a real disappointment. And when there is no comparison, it's still not that great. Is it because I came later in the day rather than the early morning?

Tried the flan and it wasn't as rich as it looked. I was expecting creamy but it was a bit chalky.
The Paris Brest's hazelnut cream was delicious, but the pastry tasted over a day old.
Same goes for the Roules a la canelle - it was a bit stale.

At Beard Papa in Japan, SF, and NY (yes I went to all 3!), the choux pastry is always fresh, crispy on the outside and soft on the inside. I was expecting that from Gourmandine, which boasts 5 stars on Yelp. Maybe I'll give it another try one day, but only in the early morning."}
{"text":"Top notch bakery where pretty much everything on the menu is delicious. It's hard to find a time when there isn't a line waiting out the door."}
{"text":"I can't begin to describe the delectable offerings of this authentic patisserie. Just go, and you'll have the hardest time trying to figure out how not to buy everything in this bakery. The breads, croissants and quiches and sandwiches and every single item is out of this world! Go!! You just have to go and see why I'm at a standstill of loss of words to describe the delicacies this place offers. Insanity is what is! Oh the maccarons!!! Just get a loaf of the baguettes or the pastries. So good I can't explain it more!"}
{"text":"We've been regulars since it opened. We have tried almost everything, and we've never been disappointed. Their baguette is the only type of bread we'll have for breakfast, and their pastries are the only quality ones you can get in the South Hills. Their sandwiches and quiches are also amazing, and always fresh. What can I say? La Gourmandine is the best!"}
{"text":"Location: 4605 Butler St Pittsburgh
Price: $

This bakery made my day when I visit Pittsburgh. I went on vacation with family and I really wanted to visit this bakery after reading all the reviews on it. The pastry was were mouth wateringly delicious. I bought a plain croissant and a twisted chocolate croissant- I legit died. My favourite was the twisted chocolate croissant...it was just sooooo good! DEAD 

Verdict: MUST GO! SERIOUSLY"}
{"text":"My first visit to La Gourmandine came after a particularly stressful exam, so after I traipsed down to Butler and opened the door, my blood pressure must have dropped by 10 with just the sweet smell of butter and caramelized sugar that invited me even closer toward the display case. I ended up buying an almond croissant as well as a butter and prosciutto (!) sandwich on a crusty baguette, both to take home... or so I thought. As I was waiting for the bus home, I couldn't help myself, so I decided to take just *one* bite of my pastry... and next thing I knew, I had sticky fingers and sugar all over my shirt. Pure bliss. The sandwich didn't disappoint, either. I also enjoyed that the woman who was helping me took the time to explain the different pastries and help me choose, given that this was my first visit. I was very impressed overall, and hope to be back again soon to try another delectable dessert."}
{"text":"After seeing an article on the best new bakeries in Pittsburgh my sweet tooth and I went to Lawrenceville. I got a few items including the almond crossiant which surpassed any that I've had in France
 Holy crap this place is good. They have exceptional bread, macarons, and pastries. They also have reasonable prices especially compared to their competitors."}
{"text":"The customer service is great. I enjoyed the bacon quiche, the bread pudding, and the almond tart. You should check this bakery out if you are in the Lawrenceville area."}
{"text":"The deserts here are amazing! I had a pistachio custard mini pie and a large macaroon filled with cream and raspberries. I love the macaroon especially because of the soft cream texture and tartness of the raspberry holding the sweetness of the macaroon in balance. Try to go when it's not busy i.e. (4 PM or earlier on a weekday) because their selection is severely cut down when people come in after work and on the weekends."}
{"text":"Always delicious. Very efficient staff. Fantastic macaroons. The other French bakery in town doesn't hold a candle to La Gourmandine.

I have never been disappointed in anything we have gotten, and I have been there dozens of times."}
{"text":"So I heard about la gourmandine on Yelp! So thanks guys! It's truly a wonderful experience. I felt as if I stepped into a real French Bakery! Everything is fresh and beautiful. The staff were extremely helpful and meticulous. I chose the Marquise, it was chocolate mousse and caramel so can't go wrong there! The chocolate was rich and creamy. I loved the texture of it. The presentation was so gorgeous, I almost didn't want to eat it... almost! Lol the bottom was crunchy and sweet. The fresh whipped cream on top made it! Details, people! Yummy! See pix for more info! Hope you find yourself there sometime soon."}
{"text":"incredible selection of breads, danishes, sandwiches and desserts. the new chocolate & almond croissant when they have it available is a must - incredible. be sure to get there EARLY on the weekends"}
{"text":"Almond croissant.  You don't need to know anything else.  Just do It.

(end of review)

Just kidding (but not really).  When I found out La Gourmandine was coming to Mount Lebanon, to say I was stoked is an understatement.  Many times I had visited the Lawrenceville location later in the day only to find my favorite treat out of stock.  Now that they're in our back yard, it's more than easy to run for a morning pastry and a coffee (probably not a good thing for my wallet nor my waist).

Honestly, everything here is solid (and from what I've heard from a few French friends, truly representative of a French pastry shop).  A word of warning...  this place gets busy during the weekend mornings and you can easily drop a small fortune on baked goods if you don't exhibit self-control.

Try stopping by on a weekday morning if you can, grab a coffee and enjoy one of their pastries warmed up...  doesn't get any better than that in the South Hills!"}
{"text":"Argh, this one is likely my fault, but I can't get past the feeling of letdown.

We decided to pop our heads into La Gourmandine as we were walking down Butler St. on a Saturday afternoon...  the latter part was likely the mistake.

I have been dying to try the shop based on the overall fantastic reviews it's received on Yelp (and my overwhelming sweet tooth).  As I opened the door, I was expecting an expansive array of fine French delicacies, waiting for my wallet to cringe under the sheer might of their sugar... but, alas I was met with a relatively empty case filled with two tarts, a couple chocolate mousse, a few raisin/cream twists, and a few baguettes behind the counter.

I blame my being late in the day (an hour before closing) on the empty case, but I also can't overlook the complete lack of product available during what should be normal business hours.  Not to be completely defeated, I decided to purchase a raisin/cream twist that, while alright, left me wishing I hadn't bothered.

I'm definitely marking this one for a second try (looking to get one of their famous almond croissants).  I look forward to that alone being a redeeming factor for an unsuspected 3-star experience."}
{"text":"They sell the BEST almond croissants EVER here. Simply divine! 

Other things I love are the lunette cookies (shortbread? sandwich w/ raspberry filling dusted w/ confectioner's sugar) and pistachio tart. I have also tried the flan, raspberry tart and lemon tart which were delicious.

A huge plus is that prices are very reasonable, especially for a French bakery."}
{"text":"what can i say that hasn't been said already?  the almond croissants are so delicious i dream of them. honestly, everything i've gotten here has been so delicate and delicious - everything you'd expect from a french patisserie.  so glad they opened this 2nd location closer to home - love this place!!"}
{"text":"I love this place! This is literally my fat kid paradise! Everything is amazing here and you can never go wrong with whatever you pick! The line is worth the wait and it moves fast so don't be discouraged"}
{"text":"I like this location better than the other ones because there is more options and it is not always sold out. And it is pretty clean and there are places to sit."}
{"text":"This place is awesome! The staff are really, really friendly and know their stuff! The spinach and goat cheese quiche is super, and the tomato chicken and orzo soup is amazing! Can't wait to get dessert when I'm done."}
{"text":"No French bakery can beat this place here. Their prices are ridiculously cheap and the taste is incredible. I come here almost every weekend and I really love trying new stuff & the old stuff. I always go back to the large macaron and their chocolate dome"}
{"text":"reminds me of the patsseries (bakeries) in Paris that I frequented during my time there.  the owners are a married couple from Paris who had family here in the PGH area.  they brought their skills to town and opened this place up.  the baguettes are spot-on ... exactly like what you're finding in the gothy streets of Paris (and maybe better than some of those places, even .)
they sell out early of certain key items thanks to their hard-core fans/followers that line-up early at 7 am I was told , on some days... get there early, in other words if you want to see their full offerings.  
i'd like to see them offer a proper \"tart au chocolat\" aka chocolate tart ... this is something that is common in the better patisseries in Paris so, i'm a bit confused and disappointed that La G. doesn't do them ...  Be nice if they were able to open another location somewhere in town ... it'd make a killing as the current one, is ."}
{"text":"Stupidly amazing French bakery.  Almond croissants were commissioned by God himself.  Seriously, go here, get the almond croissants, thank me from afar. Nothing bad can happen to you after you eat one.  Nice selection of other baked goods, macarons, rustic sandwiches, etc.  Prices are very reasonable.  This place is a slam dunk."}
{"text":"I'm a HUGE fan of this place. I walked in and looked at the menu, and the first thing that appealed to me was their prosciutto sandwich.

I thought \"well, here's something weird, a french pastry shop, that serves up prosciutto on a french baguette.\" 

The prosciutto was very appetizing and came with small vinegary pickles on it, which really paired well with the saltiness of the prosciutto. 

I know what you're thinking, \"Why didn't you order any pastries Nick?\" The truth is, after eating prosciutto, I really couldn't stomach any pastry. 

I know, I know. Their pastries looking amazing, and I can't wait to come back and devour one, or four. And I will definitely come back to do that."}
{"text":"Very disappointed. Called on a Thursday morning to inquire about quiche for Mother's Day. I was informed by the employee on the phone they have 2 available for purchase in the store and 3 special quiche's for order. I decided to stop in to place my order. I went in about 10am Thursday to place my order for Sunday and I was informed they were no longer taking orders for Mother's Day. Seriously???  I just spoke with you on the phone!"}
{"text":"Best french bakery in town, better than Gaby Et Jules in squirell hill. Unfortunately I do not frequent often being how far away from where I live and how crowded It is every weekend morning. parking is also difficult to find and there is no seating.

The price is a tiny bit overpriced but not horrible, I would still buy lots when I do make it out there
Taste is 5/5
Location 3/5
Service 4/5
Price 4/5"}
{"text":"We love this place. The food is delicious, and the prices are *very* reasonable. Everything, has great flavor: bread, croissants, sandwiches, cookies, pastries. It's not as fancy as Gaby et Jules in Squirrel Hill, and that's a good thing. This place feels like a neighborhood bakery that you can (and we do) stop at frequently, not an occasional indulgence. I love their sandwiches, the bread makes such a difference, and they're less than $6! They usually only have 4 kinds of macarons, but I think they're only $1.75 and they're better and cheaper than what you get at whole foods or various cafes in town. Their pistachio pastry cream is absolutely amazing - there's always a pistachio macaron and 1-3 other pastries that use it. 

Wishlist? I do wish they had some whole grain/seedy bread - but maybe that's a German/Scandinavian thing. Also, drinks are pretty limited, orangina or carbonated water would be a nice addition to their lunches."}
{"text":"3.5 stars. Let me start by telling you that I'm a huge patisserie snob. So when I realized that a patisserie exists in Pittsburgh, I went and found it immediately. Now I travel internationally extensively and frequenting patisseries is high on my daily agenda. I'm not trying to brag, I'm trying to provide some credibility because I'm about to tell you that though this bakery is super cute - and the items do look very scrumptious, overall, they were just okay. Of course I'd go again. I think the issue I had was the dough. The croissant didn't feel the right combo of soft and flaky to me, and that reflected in their pastries too. The women working there were very nice!

I do have to add one big disclaimer: though I bought multiple items, I only ate one on the day of the purchase. The others were eaten over the next few days and the lack of freshness probably did play into my overall thought. I will of course have to return multiple times to try everything cooked fresh so that I can at that point come update my review. It is quite a sacrifice, but it must be done for the sake of science ;)"}
{"text":"The shop is a must stop when we visit Lawrenceville. There is always a line to get in so be prepared to wait. Make sure you get there early if you want to get the best selection once they are sold out of an item they're sold out for the day.

They have a lot of different breads, pastries, desserts, & even a couple subs/sandwiches. Every time we go there we usually get the desserts to take them home to enjoy at a later time. While everything tastes amazing, it can err on the expensive side. 

The staff is always friendly and doing their best to keep the line moving and get everyone their treats. 

Stop in and grab some delectables after a nice stroll through town or after a good day at the pinball arcade down the street!"}
{"text":"This place is consistently great! We always go here to pick up some pastries for  visiting guests. The almond croissants and l gourmond (chocolate and pastry creme pastries) are always excellent. Staff is friendly and helpful, the quality is always above average and prices are quite reasonable. Nice selection of breads and deserts too."}
{"text":"The almond croissants are one of the best pastries I've ever experienced! They're unbelievable when fresh out of the oven. This small French bakery serves up delicious pastries, sandwiches, and breads on Butler Street. If you've never had a sandwich for breakfast before, try one of these and you won't be disappointed. Even though the ingredients are relatively simple, e.g. ham and cheese, the excellent bread makes all the difference. 

Highly recommended, although be aware that it's a popular location so there may be a line. Also, they tend to sell out of popular items such as the aforementioned almond croissants, so go early if you want some. It's a good thing I live across town from this, otherwise I'd come by a little too often!"}
{"text":"The husband and wife owners of La Gourmandine were born and raised in France.  They studied in Paris, and the entire city of Pittsburgh is VERY fortunate that they have opened a bakery here.  It is the very best French bakery I've ever been to outside of France.  Everything I've ever tasted here has been phenomenal.  Everything.  Everything!  If you haven't been here - you must go TODAY.  When you go here for the first time, you will feel sad and angry at yourself that you've lived in this city and haven't been here before.  You will dream about their bread and croissants.  You will find yourself sitting in your office in the middle of the day having naughty thoughts about the pain au chocolat that will cause you to blush and feel lightheaded.  You will develop an addiction that will eventually lead to finding yourself driving through the snow- and ice- covered streets of Lawrenceville in the middle of February at the crack of dawn on a Saturday morning - unbathed and anxious that you will arrive to find your favorite pastry sold-out by the time you arrive.  You will buy an extra loaf of bread for the trip home - tearing huge hunks of crusty, nutty, chewy baguette and stuffing them into your mouth at red lights.  You will get irritated when you arrive at an intersection and the light is green.  The front of your coat will be covered in bread crumbs and you will not care.  Your jaw will ache a little and you will not care.  You will arrive home and run RUN to your kitchen to grind your best coffee, and you will patiently wait to brew a perfect carafe of French-press while you steel yourself to have the fortitude to not even LOOK at the boxes of pastries you've bought.  You will even prove to yourself that you are mentally strong - by leaving your coffee sit for a few minutes to cool to the perfect sipping temperature.  Then - then you will feel an immense wave of self-satisfaction with yourself, your mental resolve, and your good fortune.  You will eat your pastries and drink your perfect coffee and your eyes will roll into the back of your head and your heart will leap with happiness.  You will sit back and you will realize that your life is wonderful and you will allow yourself to be happy.  Purely happy."}
{"text":"I have to say, the shop itself I thought was a bit pretentious. But it could just be the way Lawrenveville has been developing.  Or the fact that I was coming from Barb's Country Kitchen, a strong contrast. 

Despite my first impressions of the shop itself, the almond croissant was magical. The chocolate eclair was delightful. And even though I am a faithful supporter of BreadWorks, I have to admit the baguette was perhaps the best I've ever eaten.  I most certainly recommend giving it a try. And I will return, if for no other reason than to try a sandwich and soup, something I was not expecting to see when I walked in the door."}
{"text":"i love everything about this place.. well.. except for the line on the weekends. go early or you may be forced to select something other than you originally went for. but don't worry.. it'll be fantastic. the sweets are balanced perfectly. i don't have a sweet tooth in my entire body but i have never had anything here that i didn't finish.. with sadness when the last bite came. the sandwiches are what i usually come for. delicious."}
{"text":"I didn't expect to find such an authentic place in Pittsburgh. It is a very typical French bakery, something you don't expect to see in the middle of the country, really. The bread is done just right, all pastries are exactly what you would have found in France. No wonder that every time I stop by there is a line of people that goes out the door and into the street. Very much worth the wait!"}
{"text":"My wife was so excited when this location opened. We stop in regularly after the kids are off to school. We have yet to find anything that isn't fantastic. 

Not only are the pastries great, but it's a great place to stop for lunch."}
{"text":"The only thing better than the service is the incredible food and baked goods. Seriously, bread used to just be bread to me. Now I know the secret to happiness, and it is hidden somewhere in La Gourmandine's baguettes. 

The pastries are delightful as well, especially the Parfait Chocolat and Opera. Prices are excellent as well, and if anything they could go up a touch. 

The only downside I can think of is that they make traditional bread obsolete. You will come back again and again as your new bakery addiction grows. The next time you see a droopy loaf of bread at Giant Eagle, you will die a little on the inside and make a mental note to go to the bakery as soon as humanly possible. 

Try it, you won't be sorry!"}
{"text":"It's mostly for take out but everything is great there: breads, sweets, sandwiches. I never had something it wasn't tasty. 
I just miss seats to eating there. If you don't mind eating stand up, there are few tables but that's all. 
You can purchase coffee and tea cup to serve yourself.
I'm glad they opened their third store in Hazelwood."}
{"text":"La Gourmandine is everything a French bakery should be. The pastries are perfection, the coffee is delicious, and the staff are charming. I've been coming here long enough with my boyfriend that they remember my breakfast order now! The chocolate croissants are my favorite, and sometimes I treat myself to one of their glorious desserts. The eclairs are particularly divine. Try it, even if there is a long line. It's more than worth the wait."}
{"text":"I must admit I am a complete fan of Jean-Marc Chatellier's French Bakery in Millvale, but I gave La Gourmandine a try and they come a close second.  There was a line on Saturday morning even before the doors opened, and I think a line is a common occurrence. The almond croissants are quite excellent, plus I bought a classic lemon tart (Citron). 

I'm holding out for Jean-Marc's in terms of prices and quality, however La Gourmandine will do if I can't get to Millvale."}
{"text":"Utterly.unbelievably.delicious. Seriously. The pistachio eclair....there are no words for it. :-) Yes, parking and space is at a premium and you may have to wait,  but the wait is well worth it.  Every pastry that we tried was unique and delicious!"}
{"text":"This is what bakeries should aspire to. 
I've looked all over, and finally, my quest to find a legitimate Creme Puff (no custard!) ended here!
This is an authentic bakery that takes its' craft seriously. Everything is a masterpiece, both for your eyes and for your tongue. SO worth going to!"}
{"text":"The quiche is the best I've ever had! I've only tried one of their pastries but I loved it. I can see this place becoming quite the habit!"}
{"text":"One of my favorite in Pittsburgh! We always go there try something new every time we go to lawrenceville! One of our every time must get is there macrons. But everything else we've tried so far we're all so great! I doubt that we will ever be disappointed for any desert they offer. Every time we go, there was a line waiting but it was never crazy that we had to wait in line for 10-20minutes. But this line usually takes around or less than 5 minutes, which I would need some time to think what do we want any way. The service was always good, the stuff are always friendly and helpful. It is a place that you have to check it out if you love deserts!"}
{"text":"So it's been a few months since we first discovered this gem, and we still love it here, and still try to come out every Saturday. We love that they're always coming out with new pastries/goodies. Most recently, we've discovered the pistachio eclairs and the king's crown puffed pastry round (Sorry, I don't have the French names). And the baguettes are always good (and a steal), in addition to everything else we love there.  Still waiting for them to \"perfect\" their macaroon recipe. We'll be the first ones lined up to buy those!! If you've ever get to try one from a cake, you'll know what we mean!"}
{"text":"Best bakery on Pittsburgh I've been to so far. Not the cheapest but well worth the price! About $3-4 per small dessert, and $16-22 for the larger cakes. They also have a variety of sandwiches made with baguette bread ($4-6), and 3 quiches daily ($4-6) plus some savory pastries if you're looking for more of a breakfast/lunch. They have seasonal soups as well.

Be prepared to wait in line for at least 10-20 minutes if you're coming on the weekend. Also, there is not a lot of seating inside the small store, only 2 tables, so more of a to-go place. 

My favorite is the lemon tart, but I've never had a bad experience sampling anything here. I tend to stay away the chocolate desserts, they are too sweet for me. Selection changes each season so there is always something new to try!"}
{"text":"Probably my favorite French bakery in Pittsburgh ... this is the real deal, folks. A fantastic bakery in Lawrenceville, this bakery has just about anything you'd want a bakery to make. Fantastic pastries? Check. Wonderful baguettes? Check. Great quiche? Check. Wonderful desserts? Check. Tasty sandwiches? Check. Oh and decent coffee as well. In general, my favorite pastries here had to be the almond croissants, chocolate almond croissants, and chocolate eclair. The chocolate lava cake here is also pretty dope. You really can't go wrong with anything you pick. Just be sure to get here early, especially on weekends, as they tend to run out of the more popular items earlier in the day. It's certainly a great sign when you see people waiting before this place opens to be sure they get what they want to buy. Worth coming here ... trust me, you won't regret it."}
{"text":"We recently had a French houseguest, and he was craving some authentic French croissants. (SPECIAL NOTE: I am gluten-free, but my husband is not. This review is based on his experience of the bakeries goods!) We decided to try La Gourmandine after hearing from my sister-in-law that it was superb. We picked up a baguette, 3 regular croissants, and 3 chocolate croissants. My husband, the croissant lover in the family, noted that the regular croissants tasted very similar to the those he purchased from a bakery in Paris during our honeymoon a few weeks ago. Flaky and delicious, they were the perfect start to breakfast! Our houseguest loved the croissants, and ate four (he was a teenager, ha). He even tried one with peanut butter, which he had never had before (nutella being the condiment of choice in France, of course). He loved it all! We had the baguette with dinner, and he probably ate half of that. 

My husband also purchased an almond tart pastry, and said that it was simply amazing. He does not normally eat sweets, so this is high praise from him. Next time you are craving some authentic French breads and pastries, make sure to check this place out. But be prepared to wait, as they do get quite busy!"}
{"text":"Excellent bread and pastries-- very authentic, which makes sense since the owners are \"authentically\" born, raised, and trained. :) 

Everything about this place is great except for one thing-- I wish that they served real espresso and got rid of the Keurig-style machine behind the counter."}
{"text":"It's good. It's not bad nor is it great. The excitement is that it's way better than what Pittsburgh is used to. In a more metropolitan city this is what a typical bakery would be like. You won't go wrong here but the perspective is way off. By itself it's 'fine'. Compared to typical Pittsburgh bakeries it's off the charts good. That just means the city needs to up its standards."}
{"text":"I had been wanting to try this place forever.  With this many five star reviews, I knew I was in for a treat, but I am never over in Lawrenceville.  When I happened to drive by this location, I knew I had to stop.  I planned on getting just one or two sweet treats.  Impossible!  Their case looks amazing, the bread smells amazing, everything is just so tantalizing, that I ended up with 4!

From recommendations of some nice gentlemen savoring their treats, I got an individual-sized lemon torte, some cookie thing with pistachio cream and fresh strawberries, a chocolate croissant and a brie-sour cream torte.  To say that they were outstanding would be an understatement.  The brie torte was likely my favorite as I am a savory kind of girl.  It was brie and sour cream mixed with pepper and spices in the middle of the flakiest crust I have ever had in my life bread.  Absolutely delicious!

Don't waste your time wondering if this is as good as you hear or just dream about going there.  Go.  Go now.  And bring something back for me!"}
{"text":"It had been a while since I visited La Gourmandine and stopped by today after running some errands.  Unfortunately, since it was after noon, many of my favorites were sold out (boo!) but this gave me a chance to sample some new treats.

I got an apple and hazelnut tart.  It was good-the pastry was super crumbly but not overbuttery but there were maybe only two small pieces of hazelnut on each tart.

I got the cinnamon roll (don't recall the french name) and it was wonderful-very flaky, buttery and just the right amount of sugar and cinnamon.

I also got the pain du chocolat and it was sublime.  The chocolate was semi-sweet and super good and the pastry was flaky and buttery.

The only reason I am giving La Gourmandine 4 stars is that I received poor service.  I told the girl at the counter that I would be getting at least 5 or 6 things (ergo, the need for a largish container).  Instead of getting a box, she started SHOVING 2-3 pastries into bags clearly designed for 1.  When I asked her if she could put everything in a box, she was very put out.  I'm hoping that maybe she's new and didn't know any better, but clearly putting 6 pieces of beautiful pastry (including tarts) in \"penny candy\" bags makes no sense even if you're a new employee."}
{"text":"Baguettes, Pastries, Sourdough.. Oh My!

This place is a must stop shop is you love bread & delicious pastries. Most recently, I purchased their large baguettes, sourdough rye bread & a few pastries including their huge pink macaroon with fresh raspberries- mhm! Everyghin was so fresh & tasty & the prices are SO reasonable for the quality of the products.

I love this place and I CANNOT wait until the new location opens in Hazelwood!"}
{"text":"This place is a real gem in our town. I stopped here at least once a week for pastries my favorite is the croissant Almond. I have never enjoyed better French pastry. Their desserts are also spectacular. You will not regret ordering soup and a sandwich here."}
{"text":"Amazing! I've liked everything I've had from this bakery, including the raspberry tart (I've never liked raspberries before)! We got a variety of items for a party and while everything was good, the tart really won for me!

Certainly suggest making this a stop when you are in Lawrenceville!"}
{"text":"The pear amandine pastry was delicious and impeccably made! The pastry crust, the tart creme, the crumble, the pear bake, each aspect was very well done. (I should know, I'm a master at watching baking shows.) The pastry cost about $3.50. The other pastries and bread looked amazing too. I regretted not buying more items when I was there. I wish they had any seating area and a real coffee bar to go with the pastries, it'd make it perfect! This is more of a take out place though now. Free street parking was available when I went on Easter Sunday."}
{"text":"On a recent trip to Pittsburgh I asked my traveling companion- \"what's one thing you really want to do while we're here?\" Her response was- \"I want a cream puff\" Huh? Where the hell did that come from...it turned out to be the best challenge I've solved in quite a while. After some quick Googling all roads seemed to lead to La Gourmandine.

Turns out- it is a quaint little French bakery in Lawrenceville. Rather a delicious delicious soooo delicious bakery. What didn't we try? We sat in the cafe and enjoyed coffee with quiche while watching the never ending line swell then dissipate. After finishing breakfast we joined the quay and proceeded to order one of just about every pastry in the shop to go. It turned out to be a great decision. One pastry was better then another. To name a few- Citron tart, Marquis, mini bouche noel, eclair, croissant of every kind, and of course the whole reason we walked through the door- cream puff. 

On my next visit to Pittsburgh I will for sure make a point of getting myself a little box of magic either to enjoy in the shop or take it to go."}
{"text":"Nomnomnom. This place is delicious. For brunch one day,  I got the Le Montagnard, which is prosciutto and pickles on their French baguette. It was so good. I plan to go back and have it again.

I also got the chocolate almond croissant, which blew my mind. Unfortunately, they only have the chocolate almond croissant on the weekends and if you get here after noon, they will most likely not have it anymore. I went once on Sunday around 1:30pm and they were already sold out of the chocolate almond croissant. So sad.

I've also tried the pistachio eclair, Lunettes (cookie with raspberry jam and powdered sugar), and Belle Hélène (dark chocolate mousse filled with a pear coulis and sponge cake). It was all pretty good. Not as good as the chocolate almond croissant, but worth trying. They have so many beautiful creations, I wish I could just sit around one day and sample it all. Guess I'll just have to keep visiting!"}
{"text":"La Gourmandine has been getting busier and busier to the point the line ends outside of the front door two businesses down. But with the amazing service you still get in and out in ten minutes. 

Here's how your experience will go... 
You squeeze into the place before you can truly fit just so can smell all the goodness coming from the kitchen. Surprisingly, faster than you think a girl that was just moving at light-speed but is now calm with a smile ask your order. You order amazing warm bread and flaky pastry while trying to avoid attempting an accent. after your order you drool over the glass counter protects colorful tasty deserts. The service is one of the best so very soon before you impulsively buy a tart cake fore yourself.  You are getting rung up by another smiling girl who you cant help but love and be jealous of for some reason. The cost of your three pastries and a cup of coffee will be like 8 dollars.  As you leave you see the faces of the next bunch of customers who walk in with a smile.  You cant help but smile yourself as you leave while already shoving a ripped piece of bread into your mouth. 

The food thou is amazing and extremely fresh. Eat the baguette that day though high quality bread is only meant to last a day then just buy another the next morning."}
{"text":"Really good sandwiches and bread, interesting selection of authentic French pastries, A must stop!!!"}
{"text":"I used to love this place until they ruined a birthday! I came last Sunday to ensure everything was going to be fine for Birthday and they said if I wanted it for the following weekend I could come in on Friday to pick things out. I came in on the Friday to pre-pay and now it's 48 hours advanced notice and was told that I was told incorrectly last weekend. Well now I'm in a scramble and a Birthday has been ruined. No manager on duty and they refused to contact he manager to make this right. Their pastries are amazing - their service is far from it. If you walk in and they have what you want it's your lucky day. If you want something specific for a special day look elsewhere or risk having your event ruined"}
{"text":"Delicious... Try this place for great and friendly service. Ofcourse amazing yummy baked goods. Maccaroons are great, quiches and sanwhiches must try. We will be back often"}
{"text":"I love love love love love this bakery.  It's been so difficult to find a good bakery/pastry shop around Pittsburgh.  Before La Gourmandine, my boyfriend and I have been going to Allegro Hearth in Squirrel Hill and Whole Foods.  However, neither have left us satisfied.  We heard news of La Gourmandine this summer and we decided to give it a try one Saturday and we were not disappointed.  We come here often on Saturdays for the pastries.  They are definitely authentic (my French boyfriend verified it).  My favorite are the croissants aux amandes (almond croissants) because they are just simply warm, gooey, and delicious.  If you're lucky to get them just as they come fresh from the oven, you will need a fork and knife to enjoy them.  These are dense, sweet and buttery on the inside (filled with almond paste--though the word paste doesn't do it justice) and crunchy and crispy on the outside.  In fact, they are unlike any other croissant I've ever tasted before.  The flans patissiers, pains aux raisins, tarlettes aux pommes, choux a la creme,and mousselines are good too.  Pretty much all of their pastries.  We have never tried the breads there simply because I'm not a fan of Parisian style breads (They tend to be darker and dry). Considering the quality of their pastries, prices are very reasonable, especially compared to what we've paid at Whole Foods and Allegro Hearth in the past.  I love this place!  I wish it would be open more (like on Sunday and later in the early evening).  Also, it would be lovely if they have an espresso machine.  There's nothing like dipping your warm pastry in a cup of espresso for breakfast.  Yum!"}
{"text":"Amazing pastries and sandwiches. Truly out of this world flavors and expert baking. The interior needs some work and could stand to have a few more seats. Overall I really recommend this spot."}
{"text":"2 words: almond croissant!  i drool a little just thinking about it. 

perfect french pastries and baked goods.

baguettes are excellent too, best in pittsburgh by a long shot."}
{"text":"This location provides a great atmosphere minutes from the South Hills Village Mall. Everything is as true to a French pastry shop as possible, given its proximity. I am partial to the Pain au Chocolat, takes me back to the streets of Paris."}
{"text":"I learned of La Gourmandine last Friday, and have been in 5 times since then (and it's only been 7 days!!).  I was introduced to them through indulging in the Raspberry Torte, and have since had the croissants (coco-almond and chocolate), the baguettes, the turkey swiss sandwich, the chocolate eclair and the fruit filled macaron.  All of them were amazing but I'll be back for more raspberry tartlettes, the sandwich and the croissants.  My daughter loved the macaron - she will be asking about more of those for days to come.  

Fortunately/Unfortunately, I see myself popping in here weekly in the future, and I will have a hard time holding back from coming in daily... if it becomes more than an occasional thing, I will need to get more spin classes in!!"}
{"text":"I'm always late to a party.  In this case, a few years late.  I have always wanted to try La Gourmandine, but could never find a reason to intentionally stop here.  In the past I rarely visited this section of the city, which is a pretty poor excuse.  Anyway, wrongs have been righted and all is good in the world.  At least for me.

Walking into a bakery is quite possibly one of my favorite things in the world.  I love me some bread and the smell of fresh baked breads takes me back to my mom's kitchen.  It was quite the process for my mom, so my appreciation for a fresh bread is definitely there.  It's hard not to have your mouth water when you look at what they have to offer.

I seem to be a creature of habit, or at least habitual actions.  Which is probably why I rely on items that I know have not let me down in the past.  Which is the case with the baguette aux lardons.  Where my bacon fans at?  I see you out there.  A baguette baked with bacon bits and Parmesan cheese, how could you pass that up?  It's a great snack to have and share.  I have also had a focaccia topped with pizza toppings which is quite amazing as well.

But the whole reason you come here is because you want to indulge.  Satisfy that sweet tooth of yours.  My first visit I had gotten the delice de pistache.  I love pistachio and this did not hold back on flavor one bit.  Right mixture that did not make it too sweet.  My latest visit I decided on the eclairs au chocolat.  This this is what makes you want to come back.  The filling in this was so rich that you wonder why you never had something like this before.

Oh how I wish I was there right now.  I want me some sweets badly."}
{"text":"A beautiful European style bakery.  The presentation of the many delicacies is exquisite and the taste is even better!!  Had a wonderful chocolate eclair with a chocolate custard filling.  The apple pastry, croissants are all top notch.  Friendly, helpful staff.  This bakery is a true gem.  It is certainly worth a visit.   Highly recommend!!"}
{"text":"Love love love this small place. My boyfriend's parents live down the street and whenever we're over this area to visit, I always asked to make a stop here FIRST :) everything here is so pretty to look at it and most importantly, so so yummy! I can never remember the names of what I got because I always choose what I want on how it looks.. so the name is just a blur to me, especially with sweet pastries (ugh, so bad I know) 

Parking on butler can be a pain sometimes because of how busy this road can get but I never seem to have a problem with it. So it might just depends on the time you come in. Other than that I'm definitely coming back to try some of their sandwiches because I've heard great things on it too"}
{"text":"I want to give this place 5 stars, I really do. In truth, the quality of the food is top-notch. I've been here multiple times, and every time that I've received food, the food has been excellent.

So why only 4 stars?

Well, there was that one time I arrived at around 1:30 on a Saturday. I had my heart set on a Parisien sandwich (ham & cheese on a baguette), but I didn't see any sandwiches at all in the case. Having driven about 40 minutes to get to the place, I didn't want to give up that easily. I asked the person behind the counter if they could make a sandwich, seeing as how it was only 1:30 (a perfectly reasonable lunch time). 

The answer was no. Apparently once they sell out of the sandwiches, they do not make any more. Even though there were plenty of baguettes behind the counter... and I'm sure ham and cheese are not elusive products. No. No sandwich for me.

Frustrated and pretty hungry, I gave up and left without buying anything. I've been back since, and I do recommend stopping in, but be sure to go early if you plan on eating anything resembling a meal."}
{"text":"We came here on a French bakery trip. 
We had the big pink macaron w/ raspberries and cream. It was. AMAZING. 
They. Have. SOUP! Must be for fall season. 
It was a chicken orzo tomato basil soup and a piece of baguette came with it 
(It was delicious highly recommended)


Marquis - milk chocolate shell, creme brûlée and chocolate mousse and pastry puff in middle. This was very good, texture was great. The milk chocolate she'll was alittle sweet tho 

Tarte de citron - very good! Perfect balance of meringue and lemon 

Overall, the feel and taste is close to Paris, but not quite. But I approve"}
{"text":"I was pleasently surprised when I found out that one of the best bakeries in the city (according to Yelp)opened up a south hills location. My first visit was late in the day on a Saturday. Unfortunately, almost everything was sold out. I ended up with a chocolate croissant. It was flaky and delicious but I was not blown away. I wondered what all the hype was about. My second encounter with LG was during a party I attended. LG supplied the desserts in the form of bite size portions of their popular treats including (my fav) the chocolate eclair. Ok. Now I'm starting to get it. Those were three delicious bites. My next encounter was earlier in the day on a Saturday. I opted for the cherry bread pudding. OMG. Yep. I'm converted. It was so incredible. Hubs wanted a taste but there was no way I was going to share. Overall, forget about the calories and just go! My only gripe is that all of the portions are huge! I'd love to be able to stop in and get several small croissants or other treats."}
{"text":"Today I finally tried La Gourmandine, and it was so good that it encouraged me to write my first review.

To frame my mindset, I'm training for the marathon and Saturdays are typically my long run day.  Since it snowed I decided to run the Cathedral of Learning stairs for an hour and a half instead.  Needless to say, I was famished and seriously needed some carbs.  Fortunately, we decided to try La Gourmandine after my workout and I was about to get my fix.

When we arrived, there were people stretched around the counter--and for good reason.  Everything in the shop looked (and was) amazing.  I was dumbfounded between the culinary beauty and my ravenous state.  With help I decided on the Opera (Almond sponge cake layered with cocoa chocolate mousse 
and coffee flavoured butter cream, glazed with dark chocolate) and Religieuses (Two tiers of choux pastry filled with vanilla or chocolate pastry cream and topped with fondant).  I ate the Religieuses first and thought it was great...until the Opera made my knees buckle.  The Opera seemed to fill a void in my life I didn't know existed and I was in a complete state of serenity afterwards.  And then the carb coma kicked in.  Totally worth it.

They said there are usually people waiting outside before the shop opens.  I think I'll join them."}
{"text":"I just had their almond croissant and its delicious. Some other reviews mention the same. Looks like they run out of things quickly because they are so good. Would recommend. Can find street parking fairly easily."}
{"text":"This place is amazing. I think the owner is from France, and all his pastries look absolutely amazing. There are options for breakfast and lunch, as well as dessert pastries. I feel like you couldn't go wrong with anything you get. I've tried some of Dominique Ansel's stuff in NYC, and this stuff is as good if not better. It's unfortunate that the hours are so short!"}
{"text":"My sandwich (prosciutto,pickle,butter) was a perfect lunch Followed by a perfect pistachio macaron Also ate salted caramel macaron but too sweet for me.Will be back!"}
{"text":"I went a little crazy last week when I stopped in. I had only ever eaten what my husband would pick up from here- usually their almond croissants. This was my first time actually stopping in in person and... I just had to have it all. 

I got a chocolate croissant (so flaky that it got all over my jacket when I ate it on my ride home), a basic loaf of bread for dinner, one of their giant macaron and raspberry sandwiches, an apple thing and an apricot thing. Even with all that, it came to around $13. For the quality, I think the price is pretty fair. Everything was amazing, but the apricot pastry really stood out to me- mostly because I hadn't had anything like it before. It had a delicious layer of pastry custard with a big ol' apricot half plopped in the middle. The macaron was just as delicious as it looked. I only seem to ever see this kind in pictures on yelp- the pastry creme with raspberries. I'd love to see other varieties with other fruits, but they do have a selection of the typical, normal-sized macarons. 

I do have an unpopular opinion about their almond croissants, however. They are TOO loaded with their delicious, gooey almond filling for my taste. They are very sticky and don't really have must flakiness- just too rich for me. 

Be sure to get there early in the morning to be sure you can get what you want- like all good bakeries, they only make as much as they know they'll sell."}
{"text":"And my gourmet food pillaging during spring break continues...with almond croissants.

Having never been able to visit La Gourmandine because the PTA doesn't take me here without an obscene transfer, I seized the opportunity to do so when I had my rental car.  i've had this bakery on my bookmarks since the week after i moved to pittsburgh this past august.  In fact, I was so stoked to try out this place, I woke up at 7:30AM.  As a reference, I usually go to bed around 6AM and wake up around 1PM.

The bakery itself was just as I expected (based on the reviews and pictures I've read and seen), small and quaint.  Because of their size, they don't seem to bake in large quantities; when I got there, they had just taken my prime target out from the back. almond croissants.  For the longest time, I've been trying to research places that could match the way that St. Honore Boulangerie in portland, OR, makes their almond croissants. the two main characteristics? crispy outside (brownish), and almond paste-y goodness inside (see http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/jJP0FVA7PY7R0SkGaNC9Kg?select=q7PjkW1IQFM95teJ6Iccng for st honore's almond croissants).  most never seem to make the outside crispy enough, and because of the priciness of almond paste, many skimp out on putting a satisfactory amount.  

Priced at $3.10 (vs. St Honore's blasphemous 4.75 or something), the almond croissant was the closest that I've tasted yet to that of the bakery in portland.  Although the outside texture was still a slight miss, given my tireless search for a good croissant, I'm more than satisfied with this place. I took two of the mere three they came out with from the back, along with a chocolate eclair and something else my girlfriend ordered, and we headed out to crazy mocha in shadyside to enjoy our breakfast.

I'm not a big fan of eclairs, and I haven't tasted many eclairs before, so I can't make fair judgement of the ones at this bakery.

I'll let the pictures do the talking - do be reminded that I took all these pictures with my iPhone camera. I highly recommend this place, and I'll definitely be back again to beast mode through their entire daily batch of almond croissants."}
{"text":"How come when other girls get the flu they lose like 5 lbs and when I get the flu all I want is desserts?

Yummy !!! it is absolutely amazing... They have amazing treats and food! everything is so fresh! Their croissants and puffs come in a delightful array of unusual flavors... but my favorite of all are the fresh almond croissants and quiche... early on weekday or weekend they are usually sold out after 12 pm! so you better hurry or you will defiantly miss out! 

area is limited to seating...only three tables and six mini chairs....i suggest you get their pastry to go! can get really cramped if you stay there more then ten mins..."}
{"text":"Let me preface this by saying I'm not a big fan of sweets. With that being said, I stopped in today to purchase a single baguette. My wife is a big fan of all sweet baked goods, so I requested \"a few sweets for my wife.\" The woman was very nice and pleasant, and recommend a chocolate dish of some sorts and a lemon tart.
Though I usually avoid sweets altogether, I decided to try some of the lemon tart. It was quite possibly the best dessert I've ever had. It's changed my entire outlook on desserts."}
{"text":"It's wonderful that such a nice bakery has opened in the South Hills, but until they figure out how to manage their popularity, I won't be a fan.  I've gone three times in the two weeks they've opened.  The first time I went at about 11:30 for just a baguette and I waited in line 10 minutes, behind only two people.  The next time I stopped in for a baguette about 2pm and they had none left, so I left, too. (Seriously - a french bakery should NEVER run out of baguettes.)  The straw that broke the camel's back was arriving this past Sunday at 9:30 a.m.  The line was out the door - kudos to them for their popularity - but it took 40 minutes to get served! And all I wanted was a baguette and two croissants.  They need to figure out a better system, like more staff or two registers.   If I ever see more than two cars in the parking lot, I will head straight to Giant Eagle for my bread instead."}
{"text":"I can't even begin to describe how much I miss La Gourmandine since moving. Hands down best French pastries and baked goods I've ever had, and for the best price I've ever seen as well. Favorites definitely include the macaron aux fruit (it's massive!), tarte aux framboises, and chocolate eclair. If you live in Pittsburgh, or are even just visiting, please check out this adorable little bakery! A true gem!"}
{"text":"I keep coming back, and coming back, and COMING BACK. Do yourself a favor and get there first thing in the morning, buy yourself a coffee and a mountain of Chouquettes. Or croissant. Or an apricotine. Literally everything I have ever tried here is outrageously delicious, and at an affordable price. My only gripe is that they aren't open 24 hours a day, but in true Parisian fashion I have to curb my appetite for their pastries and eat them only at reasonable hours. *Le sigh*"}
{"text":"I love this bakery so much.  Anytime I'm walking my dog past their storefront on the weekends, there is always a line to the door.  The occasional dog will be tied to a tree in the front of the place while their owner waits patiently inside to be served.  Once you're at the counter, (the wait is no longer than a few minutes) you're greeted by some of the most down to earth sweetest people in food service.  They'll explain everything there is to know about each piece in their display, discuss pairings, shelf life and how to keep their products fresh for your special event, or just because you want to try something new.  The prices are more than reasonable, and some of their pastries are really elaborate and unique.  They make a really great pot of coffee too!"}
{"text":"Been several times now and tried something different every time. I have been amazed every time the desserts are wonderful and becoming a weekly habit of mine."}
{"text":"Loveee! I've been here about 5 times and everything here is amazing. I ordered the \"fraisier\" cake for a birthday party and received tons of compliments.  Their pastries are to die for...not too sweet and buttery. I even tried their sandwiches which are also delish...especially the prosciutto sandwich.(love the tiny pickles)  What is there to complain? MAYBE...the size of the place is extremely tight with little room to sit to enjoy their baked goods."}
{"text":"My husband and I arrived at La Gourmandine eight minutes after they opened on a Saturday morning and there was already a line out the door. The line moved fairly quickly, but the trick is to have an idea of what you want before you arrive (if you plan on going for an early morning breakfast). They'll ask you what you'd like before you ever really get a good glance at the dessert display. 

Everyone is incredibly friendly and patient. I highly recommend the croissants. The quiche was delicious. The moelleux at chocolat was a chocolate lovers dream. 

Will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Like stepping into a Parisian boulangerie!  Notable excellent items include: almond croissants, pain au chocolat, baguettes, the large round pain paysan (I think that's what it is called, you will see it on the back shelf), and their ham or prosciutto mini baguette sandwiches (made with generous butter, wonderful!). Friendly staff and never a long wait even with a line out the door."}
{"text":"This is a gem within Pittsburgh! It is a must go.

I've tried 4 things here: Marquise, Choux à la crème, Tartelette au citron, and Macaron aux fruit. They were all really delicious except the tartelette was a bit too sour and dry, while the macaron was a bit too sweet. I would recommend going here if you are craving desserts! I do wish their dessert selection was a bit bigger since it seemed limited. I would like to go back to try their regular baked goods and not their pastries. Also, the prices are not bad and decent for a gourmet bakery."}
{"text":"I stopped by on a snowy Saturday morning to pick up a goodie post gym (I workout to eat--life motto). There was a sign on the window noting of a limited selection due to weather (understandable). The croissants look so good as did the lovely macaroons. There was a baguette like bread that piqued my interest. The lady said it was bacon pieces. You have me at bacon!

I brought it back and hubby and I devoured it. The bread was flaky and bacon baked in. It was quite delicious. At $3.60, it was very reasonable. I'll definitely be back to try other goodies!

Note, it's more of a grab and go. There is a standing table and it's fairly small. Do go in!"}
{"text":"La Gourmandine is amazing!! I'm not sure that I've ever eaten at any other French bakery but I can't imagine another bakery being better than La Gourmandine. I've never had a bad thing there, not even something that was just so so. Everything is just perfect! 
Whether you want something sweet or savory they will have just the thing for you. My favorite is their almond croissant. And also the quiche. The best quiche I've ever eaten. 
The location in Lawrenceville is just as good as Mt. Lebanon. There's no difference in the quality or what they serve. 
Get over to La Gourmandine ASAP! You'll be hooked!!"}
{"text":"Amazing bakery for French pastries. Pains au chocolat, chaussons aux pommes, macarons...tous est délicieux et authentique!!! Il faut y aller!!"}
{"text":"I spent a fair amount of time in France, and know nothing about food there so won't try to be an expert on it. I just wanted to share my travels... This place is friendly, priced well, most importantly has amazingly tasty foodstuffs, I got a croissant and it was perfect. Only thing I'd like to see is a bit more savoury items."}
{"text":"I know where Bush dines, but where does that Gore-man dine? Here, of course.

I enjoyed my interaction with the extremely proud and unabashedly French owner, who is from Lille. Lille have a fantastic football team, but he's not a football man, he's a little more refined than that. Sort of like Chevron gasoline as opposed to Citgo gasoline. He's into baking. And he bakes very well. Yes, I said \"bakes\".

I give it a four because the prices are high and the products are *extremely* French which isn't always a good thing. For example, their sandwiches are as basic and bland and crusty as you could imagine. They don't really taste of very much at all. Which is *exactly* how baguette sandwiches in France are. So they're staying very true to the heritage, but since I'm not a big fan of that basic, bland sandwich (especially when the bread is this hard to bite into), I can't give it more than a 4. It does taste great, though, and is absolutely authentic. If you want to feel like you're in France, eating an actually French sandwich, this is the place to do it. It's a carbon copy. Or rather a bread copy."}
{"text":"The bread, croissants, and pastries are all out of this world at La Gourmandine.  Absolutely must stop in shop for anyone in the Pittsburgh region.  So many delicious choices and the staff are friendly.  Whenever i go on a morning walk around Lawrenceville, I always seem to find myself stopping in for a pastry."}
{"text":"Absolutely brilliant bakery! My favorite in all of Pittsburgh. Amazing staff and food!"}
{"text":"This place has amazing food. A very unique and first for Pittsburgh. I will however say that a good product isn't the full package. My experience here was uncomfortable. It was my first time, but I was with a regular. The lady behind the counter didn't greet us, she had a poor attitude when I had a question, and she just wasn't pleasant. Not to mention the counters were disorganized, I wasn't given the the option to eat here (there was an open table out front) and therefore we wasted unnecessary packaging like boxes and bags. Developing your staff is half the battle and it will ensure a better experience for not only your customers but for your staff as well."}
{"text":"I love a god eclair. But I've never had an eclair like that.

Everything we tried was marvelous - go Larryville!"}
{"text":"My visit to this little gem of a bakery was serendipitous. I drove past it on a Saturday morning, and there was a line out the door. I ended up needing to kill some time in the area before any of the Butler Street shops were open, so I hopped in line, figuring people wouldn't wait a half hour for pastries unless they were damn good.

I got a small sampling: A piece of flan, a macaron or two, a fruit tart. But the standout item was by far the almond croissant, which the owner recommended and said was one of the best sellers. It's just melt-in-your-mouth good. It paired perfectly with a cup of coffee.

The owner was also nice enough to have me try a few little samples of sugared bread and pastries despite how busy the store was, since I told her it was my first time there.

Don't let a long line deter you. The pastries here are definitely worth the wait."}
{"text":"Do you like France and miss French baking? Please go here and stop missing it.

I would happily pay 2x as much for everything they sell. The pastries are perfection. The sandwiches are life saving.

Go early and be amazed. Get there late and hang your head in shame. The goods will be gone by the time you arrive. That's how 'fresh' works. Better luck tomorrow."}
{"text":"I was able to satisfy my sweet tooth today and picked up some treats while I was in Lawrenceville! I picked up the Macarons Aux Framboises and the Croissant Aux Amandes (Croissant with Almonds). I love macarons and when I seen the larger than life macaron with fresh raspberries and cream I had to have it! Macarons are usually pretty expensive, but I thought $4 was a pretty awesome price for how large it was. When I stop in for my second visit I would like to try one of their sandwiches on a fresh baguette!"}
{"text":"Best French bakery...possibly best bakery in Pittsburgh.

I've been going for a few years now.  The first time I went there was a line out the door, and we ordered the last 2 almond croissants.  Having waited all that time, the person behind me stomped his foot and stormed out!  ...he was totally justified.  It really was that good!  Apparently they're limited to how many they make as the filling is made from something the day before.  I've had lots of stuff on the menu, everything very good.

I don't know if Yelp's one $ is accurate, it is on the pricier side, but well worth it!  Not somewhere I can afford to go daily (either calorically or financially), but certainly a treat!

One mark of an authentic restaurant is when ethnic folks go there.  I've heard more French spoken here than anywhere else in Pittsburgh."}
{"text":"La Gourmandine has been on my Pittsburgh bucket list for a long time.  I came in with the fabulous Sophia H., and we got to ordering.  I picked up a Chocolat Fondat and the Opera Cake (Hellooooo.  Opera singer, Opera cake.  Duh.).  The pastries totaled $7.05, which was steep for the size.

The Chocolat Fondat was described as a lava cake.  The chocolate flavor was very rich.  It was a fairly dark chocolate, which appealed to me.  The opera cake was this tiny slice of joy.  Dark chocolate and espresso and cake layers.  A flawless combination.  However, it was truly tiny, and was about 4 small bites total.

The only side note is that my pastries became dry very quickly.  24 hours later they were already starting to go stale, which was a bit quick for freshly baked.  Baked goods from Prantl's last me for days with no issues.  This actually might stop me from returning because I do not eats sweets crazy quickly.  These baked goods will not stay good for more than 24 hours.

If you have extra cash to drop, La Gourmandine has very high quality baked goods.  The credit card machine was down when I visited, but they normally take cards."}
{"text":"I personally have never been there but, three times I have had friend bring desserts from the for a dinner at my house and was stunned, STUNNED how good they were. and i don't even like dessert much."}
{"text":"I used to live in Montreal for years where French croissants and bakeries were easily found but the almond croissant never matched the one I tasted from La gourmandine today. The pastry was so fluffy and not terribly sweet with a subtle lasting flavor. My kids loved their chocolate eclair and choux creme. I highly recommend this bakery. Great service to boot."}
{"text":"Love. This. Place.  Not many bakeries do everything perfectly.  Well, La Gourmandine does.  Whether you are looking for breads or pastries, everything in this place is amazing. 

We recently had a get together and everyone was asking where the bread was from because it was so amazing.  I can't say I have had that before.... Bread is usually bread.  They have a few different types of baguettes there- and all are yummy.  Some of our fave pastries are: macaroon aux fruits, the citrus tart, raspberry tart, marquise, mousse de framboise and a seasonal one they don't seem to have now the religiuse de caramel (I butchered the spelling on that one). Everything truly is spectacular. 

Visits here have become part of our weekend routine. I suggest getting there early in case they sell out of anything. You won't be disappointed!!!!"}
{"text":"Love this place as much as the original.  Literally everything is delicious.  Love to stop by and pick up a coffee and croissant.  My husband loves their lemon tart and opera bars.  The place can be packed on Saturday and Sunday mornings, so a pre-office drive-by during the week is a good plan.  (Parking can be an issue...)"}
{"text":"OMG.  Buy two of everything. That is all.

Oh, and they have a new location in Mt. Lebanon."}
{"text":"Delicious, authentic French desserts. Eating their desserts make me feel as if I'm in Paris again. The macarons are to die for. Truly delicious - we will be back time and time again."}
{"text":"I heard about this bakery from a friend and I decided to grab a variety of items to bring to a morning picnic.

I got the vegetarian quiche (which has goat cheese!), clafoutis, citrus tart, fruit tart(my personal favorite!), and a few chouquettes all for around $16. In my experience french bakeries are usually more expensive, but everything was super delicious and I would totally recommend this place to a friend.

Overall great price and quality!"}
{"text":"My son and I have visited this location on several occasions, and are quite pleased with the taste of the baked goods and the attentative service.    I commend the owners and the staff for maintaining quality products and providing outstanding service.  I visited another French bakery in the Pittsburgh area, and regrettably it did not meet the same quality and service standards."}
{"text":"I got their vegetarian quiche and a raspberry almond tart.  Both were fabulous!"}
{"text":"Nice bakery. However I asked for my pizza to be hot and it was cold after they heated it up. It wasn't very good. The deserts are great. Too many people sit and talk and hit up the tables who were done eating, leaving me to eat in my car."}
{"text":"This review is based on a single chocolate eclair that I devoured from my friend's hands when he picked me up in Oakland during my Pittsburgh trip last month.  We were supposed to share the eclair that he bought but I guess I wasn't thinking much about the \"sharing is caring\" rule after the first bite.  Best tasting eclair I have ever had!

I wish they were opened later.  4:30pm is a bit early to close but I'm from NYC.  I would have loved to had the chance to visit this bakery that afternoon/early evening!

He still calls me a fatass to this day.  Guilty!"}
{"text":"Charming, Charming, Charming. Friendly staff and very moderate prices. Authentic and tasty as can be. Simple seating outside and this place has morning and evening rush hours so beware. There's a park a the end of the block across the street where you can eat your treats if the shop and outdoor seating are full (only 4 tables total so fills up quick ).

This spot is a favorite for sure. Ask about the $3 coffee and pastry deal. Bring your own travel mug for coffee as the place has only styrofoam togo cups."}
{"text":"Let's be serious--what was I thinking giving La Gourmandine only 4.5 stars???  I'm not sure, but a return visit this weekend compelled me to up my rating to 5 stars, given that everything I bought here was reasonably priced and absolutely sublime!

Upon my return visit, I ordered the following: pain au chocolat, chocolate lava cake, lemon tart, and clafoutis (a little over $11).  Like several other customers, I crossed the street to the park to take advantage of the (relatively) warm weather and get my insulin rush on.  Showing some restraint, I opted to eat only the clafoutis on the spot, saving the rest for later.  In a word, the clafoutis was divine--its interior was rich and custardy, and the cherries burst with sweet juiciness as I bit into them.

That evening, I tried the lemon tart and lava cake.  I opted to microwave the lava cake for about 30 s.  While this caused its fragile texture to collapse inward, I'm glad I warmed it, since it brought out the richness of the dark chocolate flavor.  By contrast, I ate the lemon tart chilled, and its creaminess and perfect balance of tartness and sweetness were pure perfection.

The following morning, I devoured the pain au chocolate.  This was the only of the goods I purchased that was less than flawless.  While it was delightfully light and flaky, the chocolate filling could have been richer and more plentiful.  Nevertheless, it was still quite tasty.

The only downside to La Gourmandine is that it's very popular (and for good reason!), and consequently gets quite crowded on weekends.  This normal crowding was exacerbated by a broken register during my visit.  Even so, I only waited a little over 10 min. to get through the line, order, and pay.

In terms of offerings, I feel that La Gourmandine and Jean Marc are complementary, given that they each offer specialties that the other doesn't.  Thus, Jean Marc is my go-to for kouign amann and macarons, and La G corners the market on lemon tarts, chocolate lava cake, and clafoutis.  For the most complete French patisserie experience, I highly recommend visiting both, and give them both my endorsement as the (unofficial) PGH bakery queen!"}
{"text":"By far..the best quiche ever.  I go at least once a week to indulge on a piece of quiche and a bite of dessert.  Would be nice to be able to sit and have lunch instead of standing at a table but love it anyway."}
{"text":"This really is a cute and lovely little bakery. While I can't pronounce most of the pastries that they have, I don't think you can go wrong with anything. I love how you can smell the fresh bread and pastries as soon as you walk in the door, and the servers are very friendly as well. Their croissants, both plain and flavored, are some of my favorites, with a bit of crisp on the outside and soft and savory on the inside."}
{"text":"Yummy yummy pastries.

There isn't a huge selection, but a rule of thumb to keep in mind is that better places tend to have small selections, because then they can focus on what they're good at. La Gourmandine is one of those places. Unlike other bakeries in pittsburgh, there's nothing bad here. Even my least favourite items, the baguette sandwiches aren't bad. They're crusty and probably what they're supposed to be, just no my thing. The focaccias in the back are quite good and cheap. Ask to get them warmed up.

Sweet things are where this bakery really shines. From the clafoutis to the tarts to the choux pastries, the beauty is in the details. These sweet items are not cheap, but they are worth every penny and more. The pastry cream is perfect. The fruit used is at the peak of ripeness. The tiny chocolate labels used on some of the items are the best quality dark chocolate. The attention to details this establishment has is insane. I wouldn't be surprised if they sourced butter from Europe and fruit from local farms. I haven't even talked about the croissants. If you want to ever try a \"real\" croissant, here's a good place to try them. Don't leave the bakery without getting one of each.

Go to this bakery. Try everything. Start looking for real estate in the immediate vicinity. And for goodness sakes, get the chocolate croissants."}
{"text":"I love the break and pasties here.  A true authentic French bakery. I just miss their Chaussons aux Pommes! Please make them again :-)"}
{"text":"No complaints what so ever.  Everything is perfect to the point where I almost got everything.  Macaroon: light and flaky without the filling being too chewy.  I also tried some other things who's names I can't remember, so it would have been nice if they would have given me a receipt for something.  Pear tarte: excellent!  Pain au chocolat: now that was just okay.  They had some samples on the desk that invited us to try something new as well.  La Gourmandine was absolutely worth the visit.  Service is also great considering that there was a pretty substantial crowd of people in line."}
{"text":"This is a very cool little spot. I love the fact that you can walk in and get a delicious sandwich, very similar to what you'll find overseas. Their one fault however, and perhaps this is just an acquired taste, but the bread will give your jaw a WORKOUT... it was fresh and delicious, but hard to chew... my jaw legitimately hurt for the next 24 hours. But you know what they say, no pain no gain."}
{"text":"A local friend insisted that I *must* visit La Gourmandine Bakery & Pastry Shop before heading home to South Jersey. Of course, I had never heard of it, so I checked Yelp, saw the outstanding overall rating, and made the stop a priority.

It's situated in a long street of cute stores and shops in Lawrenceville. I parked on a side street and walked down. Upon arrival, I noticed it was a busy, busy place. Small, too. Even so, I was greeted quickly and ordered several items, including:

-Ham, cheese, and butter baguette: Huge, filling, delicious, top quality. Would buy again.
-Lemon tart: For my mother. She liked it.
-Clafoutis: For my mother. She adored it.
-Chocolate cake: Delicious!
-Large macaron: I honestly forgot to eat this. And just realized as much. Darn!

I understand the allure of this spot and would absolutely return in the future. They do sweet and savory well!"}
{"text":"OK, I am actually a loyal Jean Marc Chatellier fan.  True to his French root, however, JMC takes off for a month long vacation in the middle of the summer. Where else should a girl turn to to satisfy her insatiable need of patisseries? A friend suggested that I try to fill the void with La Gourmandine (\"it's not cheating on JMC if it's closed.\"). 

I had previously passed on La Gourmandine, penalizing it (perhaps unfairly) for its hipper Lawrenceville address and its posher decor. But one fine Saturday morning, my croissant addiction got to me, so I finally caved and went in. 

Here is how I feel the two bakery stacked up against each other:
* plain croissants -- JMC's are consistently better. At G's, one week's croissants were kind of doughy, but the next week's were nice and flaky
* almond croissants -- I actually slightly prefers G's. JMC's almond croissants don't taste particularly almond-y, more like a vanilla pastry with some almond garnishes.
* fruit pastries (apple turnovers, etc.) -- a tie. I think G's are sweeter and more dessert-like while JMC's are more like breakfast pastries.
* dessert tarts -- JMC's hands down. More varied, fresher tasting.
* opera cake -- here, I have to give the nod to G's. It is less dense and not as over-poweringly sweet as JMC's.

Some other points I appreciated about La Gourmandine:
* On Saturdays, G opens later than JMC. So whereas JMC's most popular items are sold out by 10am, I can saunter into G's as late as 11:30am and still get a wide selection.
* It is easier to get to G's by public transportation than JMC's.
* G offers sandwiches and other savory items. I've not tried them yet, but they do look delicious
* The coffee at G's is better than the coffee at JMC's.

Aspects that favor JMC:
* Overall La Gourmandine is maybe 20% more expensive.
* Although the servers are cheerful and friendly, my purchasing experiences at La Gourmandine somehow feel less warm, more impersonal. 
* Sometimes, there are free samples at JMC's.
* JMC has macarones

So what do I conclude from these comparisons? Well, Pittsburghers are pretty lucky to have a choice of decent patisseries!  Now that JMC is back from their vacation (and as La Gourmandine is gearing up for theirs), I'm back to my weekly routine of trekking out to Millvale."}
{"text":"WOW!!!!
 
I have never walked into a bakery that smelled this good.
That is the first impression. The pastries are unique: not dried out, crusty pretty pieces. Fresh, flavorful, not-too-sweet... just the right touch of flavor to leave a vibrant aftertaste. Only a few variations. That is because everything is fresh, made from scratch. No commercial mixes here. 
I really can't pick a favorite item, but the small loaves of bread are really special. Large enough for two. No leftovers. 
If you have ever been to a bakery with dozens of different cookies, pastries and cakes... this is not that kind of bakery. 
Better than I have tasted in Germany, France , Denmark or Switzerland. Fresher. 
Remember the word FRESH. It defines La Gourmandine.
I wanted to add photos... but, sorry, I ate everything!"}
{"text":"This is a French-owned bakery so I had some high expectations that it would be really good.

I got their croissant, a chocolate croissant, and a mini baguette. I did not not think they were that great. The croissant especially was not as flakey and crispy as I normally like my croissants, and the inside was not that buttery. It seemed dry to me and I actually didn't eat the whole thing. The chocolate croissant was a bit better, and the mini baguette was OK."}
{"text":"Heavenly.  An absolute must if visiting or living in Pittsburgh.  Between the desserts, baked goods, and coffee I have never had anything I didn't absolutely love."}
{"text":"This is a great French Bakery on Butler Street In Lawrenceville.  The pastries are all delicious.   You really cannot go wrong.  The almond croissants are a must.  I also highly recommend the flan and chocolate croissants.  In addition to the pastries, the breads are great to take home for dinner.  The sandwiches are very well done.  The coffee is from La Prima so it is great as well.
The best time to go is during the week.  You may have to wait in line on Saturday and Sunday mornings.  If you get there too late on weekends, most of the selections will be gone."}
{"text":"This bakery was a small piece of heaven sent down from God!  OMG the bakery is so tiny, but the smells and flavors of the dessert are a force for any larger bakery to reckon with.  Ummm I so loved the chocolate wafer bar (forgot the name of the pastry) lol  but it was DELICIOUS! As I'm bidding Pittsburgh a farwell I shall miss this wonderful delight!!! Bye yummy bakery!"}
{"text":"This is a really great bakery and pastry shop.  I appreciate that they have some savory options as well, such as quiche (I'm considered myself not a fan of quiche before this visit but am now thinking I have just had some really dry, inferior quiches up to this point) and sandwiches.

We had:
- Coffee
- Vegetarian quiche (yum)
- Brioche Bostock (this was my favorite - If you like dense bread and almond cream/extract flavors, you will like this)
- Chocolate croissant
- One more thing that I can't remember the name of that was described as being similar to bread pudding.  It was good, but I thought it was more of a cross between a custard and bread pudding because it was really smooth (no bread bits) and creamy/eggy."}
{"text":"I'd heard about La Gourmandine for years before finally trying it.. and I'm kind of glad it too me so long to get there, because now I'll never be able to just drive past without stopping again. Wow, these pastries are GOOD. Specifically, the almond croissant was incredible, 10/10 would eat again.
Stepping into La Gourmandine was a step out of my everyday food monotony and into a momentary reprieve of tasty, masterfully crafted deliciousness."}
{"text":"Going to La Gourmandine makes me truly, genuinely, sincerely happy. That is all you need to know."}
{"text":"So... it is a busy trendy french bakery. .. wishing you could here the way I am saying bakery... because it is not the kind I had grown up with. Yes there are pastries with adorable little swirls and such but if your looking for a good old fashioned bakery than this isn't it..  if you want something thats pretty close to fancy french pastries than this is probably your kinda place. Everything I had was tasty, just not what I was looking for. The pistachio pastry was the best."}
{"text":"While everything is pretty good, my favorites, in order, are:
1. Almond croissant (no question!)
2. Clafoutis
3. Chouquette 
4. Chocolate eclair

Lines are real on the weekends, so come early! There's usually plenty of street parking. They also have sandwiches and soups! There are only a few tables inside (lines make it pretty cramped), and no outdoor tables."}
{"text":"The pastries are delicious, especially the pumpkin flavored ones.  However, I HIGHLY  suggest that anyone who goes there tries a baguette sandwich- the tuna is my favorite."}
{"text":"Sigh... I was hoping to give this place a great review. I had seen the reviews other Yelpers had given and I was expecting some mouth orgasmic greatness. However I was left with just a tease of pleasure. The location isn't great, however how much control does one have over that. The shop is small with a few seats for a quick coffee and a pastry. The pastry shelves were really empty and their reasoning was they were pretty busy and ran out. If this is a common occurrence I would expect them to have a larger number of pastries baked to keep up with the business. I felt like I barely got a taste of what this pastry shop could offer. I ended up getting their cream puff, lemon tart and pear tart. They were good and had the tastes I expected. The cream puff was very light and felt like a salty sweet cloud. The pear tart was more crusty pie than pear because it only had a slice of pear in the middle; wheres the flavor? The lemon tart was the best of the three with a nice sour and tart taste with a great smooth lemon curd. 

I would like to re-review this at a later time after going back here again hopefully at an earlier time where they have more options. I need a second look, however with what they offered me at this time I am left unimpressed."}
{"text":"Another gem in Pittsburgh. Serves desserts, We had an amazing chocolate parfait to go. Silky, mousse-y, and creamy yet not heavy at all. Coffee eclair was also very good. Beautiful..."}
{"text":"I don't need to say anything that hasn't already been covered in the other reviews.  This place is decadent.  If you want high quality, delicious pastries at great prices - this is the place to go.  It's awesome that this second location has opened in the south hills!  The only recommendation would be to add a few cafe tables outside.  Get there early to get first dibs on your favorite items before they sell out!"}
{"text":"Superb almond croissant - the best in Pittsburgh. Their sunflower bread is also excellent. They close too early, in my opinion (T-F they close at 4:30, and Sat-Sun they close at 2:30)."}
{"text":"It's not often one finds an authentic French bakery in the US that isn't outrageously expensive. This place is that rare thing. We happened upon it somewhat by accident and bought a tuna baguette for later, a piece of quiche, an almond croissant and a few macarons. Every bite was superb. And the service was very friendly and efficient. What a gem!"}
{"text":"Are you kidding me!?  A French bakery in the middle of Lawrenceville!?  I stumbled in here almost by accident.  I was in the neighborhood for an event, looked for a nearby place to get a snack, and saw my Yelp guru Rachel C. is a huge fan.  Good enough for me!  And not only that, but ever since visiting Paris for the first time in 2013, I've become something of a francophile, at least culinarily.  I stepped in to see some amazing delights, such as pain au chocolat, almond croissants, raisin tarts, and a variety of cold sandwiches.  The place was busy, but moving when I walked in, and thank goodness that even though the last jambon-beurre (ham & butter) sandwich was taken from the display case by the time I got up to place my order, they had more in the back.  It's a French/Parisian staple, and I wasn't about to leave without it.  It lived up to my expectations.  Good butter, delightful ham that wasn't too fatty or too salty, and bread with the perfect chewy texture.  I don't live anywhere near here, but should I find myself with occasion to be in the neighborhood between morning and midday, I know where I'm going to head first!"}
{"text":"I found this bakery shop accidentally.  But now  I will be returning to this shop purposefully.  The croissants melt in your mouth.  My daughter had a vegetable and feta cheese sandwich on an amazing ciabatta bun.  You may want consider going to La Gourmandine for lunch. The girl behind the counter was friendly and offered suggestions of breads to match my dinner.  Whether you are in Lawrenceville or not, I would seek out this bakery."}
{"text":"With La Gourmandine, you get all the deliciousness of French pastries without all the hassle of attempting to speak French. This is a bakery that was recently featured in the NYTimes' 36 Hours in Pittsburgh video, and I think it was worth the shoutout! 

+ Just the right amount of variety, from savory quiches to sweet tarts to buttery croissants.
+ The staff were quite friendly. 
+/- Both times I've gone (once around noon, once in afternoon), there's been a decent crowd. Speaks to the good food here!
+/- Oof. I've insisted on trying pastries I'd never tried before, and unfortunately those happen to be all the ones involving cream. It's good cream, but still, a few bites is enough for me. 

On my last visit, I got the Paris-Brest and the Choux a la Creme, which was a huge mistake because both involve COPIOUS amounts of cream. It's basically impossible to eat both in one day. I also got a Marquise, which is like a giant fancy layered candy bar! Be still my clogging heart.

Today I had the Delice de Pistache and the Croissant Aux Amandes, for $6.60 total. The pistachio cream was surprisingly refreshing, at a good level of sweetness. The croissant was the winner though. It had such a nice buttery flaky interior, yet a crisply sweet glazed almond outside. PERFECTION.  

I took my treats to the park across the street, and subsequently food coma-ed for a little bit. I am impressed the French manage to stay so svelte with bakeries like this in their country. Ugh."}
{"text":"I love this bakery so much! Highly recommend the almond croissant but they do run out so you'll have to stop by in the morning. The sandwiches are really good- I love the prosciutto with butter and pickles. The baguettes are delicious. Street parking is annoying but welcome to the city- drive around the block. It's worth it!"}
{"text":"The almond croissants and the lemon tart make my mouth water just writing this.

It's easy to get to, not bad to get in and out. The staff is great and the coffee is awesome and I am a huge cofffee snob. 

I go to both here and Mt. Lebanon. Super high quality, not just your usual casually slapped together pastry. It's perfect."}
{"text":"I've been here twice after people kept recommending it to me as really authentic AND delicious.

I highly recommend getting the La Gourmandise pastry which has vanilla cream and scattered chocolate bits for those of you who think the usual pan au chocolat (the chocolate croissant essentially) doesn't have enough chocolate.

They have gigantic macarons with fresh macarons and some sort of cream. GIANT macarons. Seriously. Forgo the birthday cake and just get that.

Their quiches actually look really good too, and seem very popular with locals.

I believe another popular choice are the almond croissants but I've yet to try them!

The service here is great, they're very patient, and occasionally they have samples in store!"}
{"text":"The best dessert I've ever had....EVER!

I had the raspberry macaron with fresh raspberries and lychee cream. The macarons were baked to perfection. I mean perfect! They were pink with a chocolate decor. Twice the size of a normal macaron. There were 4 fresh raspberries inside and the surrounding cream was the lychee butter cream. The cream was perfectly smooth and sweet. 

I can honestly say that thus place is a true french bakery. J'adore."}
{"text":"I can not tell you how \"wow\" made it out of my mouth after every bite! Valentine's weekend and cafe a la \"my house\" was the idea. My sweetie and I love cafes and sugary treats after active city days. Since I don't know of any late night bakery cafes in Pittsburgh like in Boston I created the atmosphere.

A long weekend was in the works so I picked up an assortment from under the glass. Everything looked like edible art. I started with a Napoleon, then a pistachio eclair with a chocolate on top, a round chocolate mini cake, a lemon tart, and a chocolate croissant. It is so inviting in that little shop, not just because of the aromas coming from the front door.  The tea selection is amazing too. I buy my tea from the same company online bc it is not sold in stores and it is the best. 

The first night we had the Napoleon. I was expecting something like from the Italian bakery. It did not have the light custard in it, more like a dense cake with layers of chocolates. It was delicious but not quite what I was craving.

The green eclair was the next night. Amaaazing. Light, delicate, pistachio cream and fall apart in your mouth custard. I stole an extra bigger bite on this one. We also had the buttery perfect croissant this evening. Paired with my agave sweetened, vanilla, and cream tea it was better than sitting in the cafe.

The next afternoon I started nibbling the lemon tart. Just one bite. Sweet and lemon with a butter crumble crust. It was gone in no time.

Last but not least the chocolate mousse mini cake. I'm going to admit we are cheesy and we ate it in bed, sharing bite after perfectly moussey, chocolaty, heavenly bite.  This one was denser like the first dessert but more of a chocolate overload. Mr. B's favorite. I loved the pistachio eclair best. After a long weekend all the desserts held up and tasted fresh. It looks like this will be our new tradition."}
{"text":"This bakery is a gem in Lawrenceville. Every time I walk across the 46th st. I can't help but come in and buy some pastries. I've tried almost all of their pastries + savory sandwiches. Good selection of pastries everyday. The early you get the more options you'll have to choose from."}
{"text":"After three years in France, I can definitely confirm that this is a the real deal.  Fabien and Lisanne have taken a lot of time and care to make certain that their pastries are authentic.  I appreciate that they have kept their food true to tradition -- while there is something to be said for altering your menu for the local geography, they've kept the icing in the bag and adhered to the recipes, making La Gourmandine feel like a patisserie you'd find in a little French village.  The chouquettes and tarte aux poires are especially good.  Plus, this is a great spot to get a taste of French culture, with local language meetup groups camping out here!"}
{"text":"Highly-recommended for anyone looking for bakery heaven. The lemon tart was perfect and the chocolate eclair was exactly as it was supposed to be (tasty, chocolatey goodness).  They had other items, but once I got those babies, the tastebuds were happy."}
{"text":"My nephew and I headed to La Gourmandine in Mt. Lebo to pick up some treats and he thoroughly enjoyed the chocolate eclair while I indulged in the pistachio eclair.  Bought home some chocolate cakes and raspberry jelly cookies which quickly disappeared.

Adults and kids can enjoy these treats!"}
{"text":"When I die, I hope heaven feeds me La Gourmandine."}
{"text":"My dreams have come true: there's a decent pastry store in Pittsburgh. Luckily for me and my wallet it is far away from where I live. If you get excited about the simple things in life like a sturdy loaf of pain de campagne or a brie tart or even a barely sweetened brioche you have to check out la Gourmandine."}
{"text":"I'm French-Canadian and I've grown up with French bread/pastries/etc at every single holiday and/or special event so I consider myself a connoisseur of French baked goods and I would have to say this is a pretty fine place to get something delicious. The only reason why I didn't give them 5 stars is because, well. My mom is French and she will forever be in my heart the best baker in the world. Everything is baked with love and you can't top that, but La Gourmandine does come in at a very close second!"}
{"text":"This is one of my absolute favorite places in Lawrenceville. The big macaron with raspberries and cream is one of the best desserts I've ever had in my life. Their pastries are authentic, beautiful and all taste wonderful. Today they gave me free Madelines, a baguette, and 2 pizzas for no reason other than they are really great people (: 5/5 customer service."}
{"text":"Authentic French pastries and food! We were welcomed with immediate, fast and friendly service upon entering the shop. Everything was very reasonably priced, and meals include a drink option. Absolutely delicious food and pastries! I haven't found this quality food, especially pastries, in the US. The desserts easily rival what you would find in an upscale restaurant. We ate dessert at the shop, and took a second round home to share! Even though it's a two hour drive, I will certainly be returning."}
{"text":"I cannot say enough about how delicious the pastries are at La Gourmandine.  I've tried the almond, regular & chocolate croissants.  The almond is my fave, the taste is unexplainable!  The tarts were also very delectable.  The only thing to know is that they use almond flour here.  My boyfriend has a nut allergy, but he's been fine eating the things with no added nuts.  The line can be long sometimes but the service is quick and friendly.  When the line's long, then it must be worth the wait.  It's also a little pricier than your average bakery, but you're getting quality.....not just a donut!"}
{"text":"My wife is a culinary school graduate and has worked at several places with great bakeries. La Gourmandine stacks right up there with some of the best she and I have had. From the delicious breakfast pastries to their bread; I've never been disappointed with anything I've gotten. It's a bit pricey but I feel it's worth it for the quality and flavor you get. Their croissants are buttery and flakey; just they way they should be and the Gourmandine pastry is filled with this amazing cream that I dint understand but crave all too often. If I ever travel to France, this is the benchmark I'll stack their pastries against."}
{"text":"Their choux is divine, really beautiful. And the pastry filled with custard and covered in vanilla glaze with pearls is alone worth a trip across town.

While Jean Marc takes the trophy for croissants, and is more reasonably priced too, La Gourmandine excels at all things choux and some of their pastries are unique and uniquely good."}
{"text":"Meh. Nothing to write home about. Not sure what the hype is."}
{"text":"Pastries and cakes that are 'TDF'. Now I know where to go for good desserts."}
{"text":"Didn't know much about La Gourmandine before my husband and I popped in here on a recent Sunday, just that it's got some impressive Yelp cred.  I've heard and read that parking on Butler Street can be rough, but it was a piece of cake during our early afternoon visit, and I can't imagine it would be tremendously difficult any time of day if one is willing and able to walk a few blocks.  I was surprised by how tiny this place is, bummed there weren't more options from which to choose.  No worries though; my sweet tooth was satisfied.

While in the shop I recall wishing that the label indicating the name of each item also contained an explanation of the item.  I have no problem asking questions, but when there's a line behind you it's nice to have info more readily available.

I don't remember the exact names of the couple pastries we scooped up, but for the sake of this review I'll refer to them as the \"pistachio thing\" and the \"chocolate croissant.\"

Would have liked for the chocolate croissant to contain a little more choc, but my thighs thank La Gourmandine for limiting the amount of rich choc nestled inside the buttery pastry.

The pistachio thing was really good.  Great texture and flavor.  The chocolate chips added a little something extra special too.  I'd order the pistachio thing again, and I'd also order the éclair because I think it's a similar dessert in terms of texture.  And I typically don't even really like éclairs, so that says a lot.

I love almond and noticed a bunch of reviews praising La Gourmandine's almond croissants.  Might have to get one of those next time too!

Did I mention La Gourmandine is tiny?  There's some seating, but I wouldn't recommend enjoying your goodies inside unless you don't mind butts in close proximity of your face and food.  There's a little community park with some benches right across the street, a nice coincidence."}
{"text":"I met a friend for lunch at the shop's Mt. Lebanon location today, and we were not impressed.  It smells divine when you walk in, and the bakery case looks wonderful. Lunch, however, was mediocre. You can pick a sandwich and drink for $6.50. The sandwich is nothing special, and there are no sides available. If you're really hungry, you will not leave satisfied. The staff was very nice with the exception of the French cashier who was actually rude to my friend when she asked about her drink options, and seating is very limited."}
{"text":"New location, same amazing breads, pastries and French yummies as the more well known place in Lawrenceville.  I love this place. There is usually a long line on weekends, but it is so worth the wait.

Baguettes, quiche, croissants, it's all delicious."}
{"text":"I stopped by here a few Saturday's ago with my girlfriend for breakfast.  We were going to try to get there at a little after 9 but didn't look at the hours until we were on our way there.   So in route we found out that it didn't open until 9:30 but as we had been wanting to come here for awhile, we decided to wait in our car.  It became fortuitous though as shortly after we got there a line started forming outside and so we quickly inserted ourselves in the queue.  Whenever the doors opened promptly at 9:30 there was quite a bit of a line behind us and not everyone was able to make it into the store.  The store itself is quite cute with a display counter taking up a large portion of the room with a brick wall behind it with a chalkboard menu and French flag.  Everything in the display case looked wonderful and led to a tough decision on what I would want later. There were also two small two-tops inside and we saw some workers carrying a few more tables out the door while we were waiting to purchase our breakfast.  

I decided to go with one of the combos that they had on their menu which was a tart au brie with a coffee.  After I ordered the cashier asked me if I wanted it warmed up to which I replied that I did.  In the meantime I sat down at one of the two tops with my girlfriend and enjoyed my coffee which was fairly good.  I thoroughly enjoyed our seat inside as the volume of people coming in and lining up outside made for some good people watching.  A short time later my brie tart was finished being heated and I was able to eat it.  Man was it delicious with the warm brie tasting amazing on the puff pastry!  My girlfriend and I also really enjoyed her almond croissant which she was nice enough to give me a taste of.

The bottom line for me is that I will definitely be headed back here in the future.  I loved both the feel of this place as well as the food and I am excited that they will have Sunday hours after Mothers Day."}
{"text":"This place is adorable! The pastries are quite good, although not the best I've had in Pittsburgh. The service was also very efficient and the staff was very friendly. If I lived closer to Lawrenceville I would come here more often."}
{"text":"Most delicious French pastries ever! Expensive, but a treat for the eyes and well as the tummy! Love the almond croissants especially but everything they make is top notch.
Most locations are small and seating is very limited so there is not a lot of space to sit down and enjoy the treats."}
{"text":"I've never passed here on the weekend where there wasn't a line in the morning, very popular bakery.  Great selection of baked goods and great service."}
{"text":"Even though I've given this place a five -- and I went here since day one -- I don't go as often anymore, though I mean to go back.  The main thing I've noticed is the quality of La Torte has gone down and that was a colossal loaf when the place was a little closer to newly opened.  Having been to places like the Buttercooky in New York, this is only a fraction of the whole enchilada."}
{"text":"Knowing that this is one of Pittsburgh's highest rated restaurants, I dragged my husband here this Saturday morning to try some of their treats!

Parking was a bit of a challenge. I drove down the main street for a bit and then finally ended up turning off onto a side street. Thankfully, spaces were available in front of the little row houses. I was also thankful that the available spaces weren't blocked by a chair or flower pot (the Pittsburgh way of reserving spaces as a resident.)

I had asked my husband to go to the shop with me so that we could enjoy breakfast together. However, there were only three tiny little tables in the restaurant that felt claustrophobic considering the number of people lined up close by purchasing pastries. We decided to abandon our original dine-in plan and just went home with take-out. The lack of space and inability to enjoy dining in the shop is the reason this bakery gets 4 stars instead of 5.

The items that were purchased were out-of-this-world ridiculously delicious! We tried the following:
Pain au chocolat ou Chocolatine (Chocolate Croissant)
Quiche Vegetarienne (Goat Cheese and Spinach Quiche)
Délice de Pistache (Pastry filled with Pistachio Mousse and Chocolate Chips)
Eclairs au chocolat  (Chocolate Eclair)
Marquise (Creme Brulee, Caramel, and Chocolate Mousse wrapped in a Chocolate shell)

My husband I snacked on these tasty treats all day Saturday and Sunday. Mmmm mmm mmm. I will definitely be back soon!"}
{"text":"The display actually wasn't that appealing. Flattened croissants. Some of the chocolate cakes lost their oomph. 
I got a chocolate almond croissant, my favorite, and it was crunchy. Like day olds. But it wasn't even noon yet. I was sad. This place was so highly recommended."}
{"text":"I admit, I'm a Jean Marc's loyalist. When I have a hankering for some delicious French pastries, I hightail it to Millvale to get my fill of buttery deliciousness. Unfortunately for me, Jean Marc isn't always around when my pastry cravings strike (how dare he close his shop on Sundays!), and I need to fill that void. 

La Gourmandine definitely holds its own when it comes to the French pastry game. I've been here several times now and have always been fairly happy with my selections. I've never tried their desserts, but as far as breakfast pastries go, theirs are solid. The croissants are quite delicious -- buttery, flaky, and chewy like a good croissant should be. Occasionally I find that they are *slightly* more crispy and overdone on the top than I'd prefer, but it's not a huge deal. Their La Gourmandise breakfast pastry is probably my favorite...puff pastry filled with a not-very-sweet vanilla pastry cream and chocolate chips. So flaky and tons of flavor in each bite...it's divine. I'm not a fan of their signature almond croissant that everyone else seems to love...it's too syrupy sweet for my taste and I'm not a fan of the crumbly texture. 

Overall, although I do prefer Jean Marc's, if you're looking for authentic and delicious French pastries, you won't go wrong with La Gourmandine"}
{"text":"The best french bakery hands down.  I live in Virginia and wish there was something close to the level of greatness as this place.  Every time I come up to Pittsburgh,  I make sure to stop here for their tuna and turkey sandwiches.  The french bread is to die for and it is the best I have every tasted.  If you are in town check this place out!"}
{"text":"I was instructed to get the almond croissant on my first visit here.  Unfortunately, not a single almond croissant was to be found.  Instead, a very helpful employee explained what my other options were and offered her suggestions.  I had a wonderful apple tart that was a combination of spiced apples and applesauce.

I also bought a baguette, which I heard they are famous for.  I couldn't even make it home without trying a piece (or three).  It was really delicious.  The location is a bit out of the way, but Butler and Lawrenceville are expanding, and I'm excited to see what else is coming!"}
{"text":"Butter butter everywhere!! I selected six pastry in lieu of a traditional bakery cake for a birthday celebration. All were terrific. \"Must try-s\" are the Paris Brest and the almond croissant. Choux à la Crème and the Chocolate cakes -- either hazelnut or yellow cake -- were heavenly. Avoid the simple vanilla custard -- while  it is good, it is not as outstanding as most other goodies."}
{"text":"Just another great place in Pittsburgh ! French bakery is really good everything was fresh! Coffee was good! Really enjoyed it all"}
{"text":"We were referred to this shop courtesy of another local shopkeeper who mentioned the owner was from France and produces consistent quality bread and pastry.  Visiting the shop took my wife and I back to a small pastry shop we once stumbled upon while walking the streets of Montmartre.  Pastry we tried we outstanding.  We both agreed that any future trips to Pittsburgh would require a return visit to this shop."}
{"text":"I can't remember the name of the pastry I got. But it was so good! When I ordered it I originally thought it was a giant cookie, though that is not the best way to describe it. Very light, not too sweet. Fruit-jam-type filling and powdered sugar. Generous sizing. We went in on a cold day near Christmas and only had to wait a minute or so before we were served. 

There is no seating, only a standing table if I remember correctly. Anyway. This place is great for a treat! That's what we went in for, and it exceeded my expectations."}
{"text":"Excellent. Stopped here during a road trip from DC, found the pastries and sandwiches to be delightful and the staff welcoming and friendly. Wouldn't miss this place on return trips."}
{"text":"OOOOOORRRRRLLLLLHHHHHHHHH GAAAWWDDDDD. That's really the best way to describe what you will say if you eat one of their creations. Highly recommend the chocolate eclairs and the almond croissant. And even better, the cashiers are ALWAYS super friendly and have a smile on their face."}
{"text":"Don't count on dining in here, because it is small with limited seating.

The almond croissant I had was absolutely perfect decadence. I can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"I saw this place has 5 full stars and I just had to---pop the bubble.  Mainly because it's really not all that great.  Have you all tried Jean Marc in Millvale?  This place cannot hold a French candlelight  to Jean Marc!  

Cons: It's more expensive, the chocolate croissants have less chocolate, and the signature almond croissant was ho-hum to me. 

Pros: This place does have a very nice location and it does look very pretty inside and out.  It has a couple tables to sit at.  It has a wider variety as it is a bakery (I was eyeing one of those French sandwiches).

Main point is I would come back only if all the bridges to Millvale were blocked and if that were the case, I might just give up my French bakery excursion altogether.  

Try Jean Marc!"}
{"text":"I love this place! A friend told me about it so we decided to head over before we hit the strip for some shopping. We parked around 8:40am (opens at 9am) on a Saturday and there was already a line by the door! I saw a bunch of runners in line and I thought it was funny how they went for their morning run and then got in line for some baked goodies. Sounds legit. It made me even more curious about this place and their sweets.

As soon as it hit 9am, the door opened and the intense smell of heaven came wafting out. Everyone formed a nice line and filed in with order. I got a Eclairs au chocolat and some coffee. The staff there was quick to respond to requests so the line came in and out quickly. I liked that even though I really wanted to kneel down and gawk at all the stuff I still wanted to try while I took mental pictures of everything in the case before it was my turn to get my butt out so someone else could drool. Coming back ASAP!"}
{"text":"Delicious croissants and bread. It smells like heaven in this place. They also have sandwiches you can order but I have not tried them yet. If you're in the area definitely don't miss out!"}
{"text":"I'm not really sure it gets any better than La Gourmandine. Sure, there's no sense to the layout of the bakery, the lines can get long, and they'll offer seasonal items that blow your mind for a few weeks only to never return again (ex. religieux au caramel)...but it's worth the \"hard times\" to visit and load up on the sweet goodness that fills up this small French bakery.

The sweets are incredible. Macarons, tarts, eclairs, etc. I've tried every single item in the displays case at least once...and for the most part, I've rarely met a dessert on this level that can match La Gourmandine at other bakeries. From savory, to sour, to sweet, they nail all of the flavor profiles. They have a dessert for everyone. Rich, decadent options and more savory ones. One of my favorites on the sweet side is the macaron au fruit. It's a giant macaron with raspberries and cream in the middle. Talk about the perfect variety of textures and an overload of flavor! I could go on all day about their desserts...so amazing.

If you don't have a sweet tooth, not to worry. They have excellent baguettees, sandwiches (albeit only three varieties), quiches, and things like the tarte aux brie. I seriously can't say that I've ever had anything bad from the place. Sure, I haven't loved everything, but that came down to me not being a fan of hazelnut (gasps from the masses of nutella fans), more than the Paris-brest being at fault. Ha. 

Overall, you can't go wrong at La Gourmandine. Great food, desserts, and smells paired with super-nice employees and reasonable prices. Also, it's fun to chat with the other people in line for a sense of community in the mornings. What's not to love!"}
{"text":"Lunch in Lawrenceville? Make it La Gourmandine.  Love the pastries and the sandwiches.  My favorite was the prosciutto with the baby pickles, but honestly I don't think you can go wrong with any of them.  Their baguettes are crispy on the outside but soft on the inside and make wonderful sandwiches.

I've been trying to not indulge my sweet tooth too much recently, so I've skipped the fantastic looking pastries most times.  I did give in a couple times though.  Once was a double chocolate mousse, and the other was a fruit tart   Both were good, but the chocolate mousse was amazing."}
{"text":"This place is one of my favorite bakeries I've ever been to.

The food is great quality, crafted with care and the environment has an authentic French vibe to it. The service is always fast and friendly, although they can get a little swamped on the weekends.

I love the Cheux La Creme and Chocolate Croissants, but also the Tomato Soup I had was really awesome. I would stop here every morning if I could and didn't mind packing on 100 extra lbs."}
{"text":"La Gourmandine was high on my list. I was determined and I ended up expending much effort in the behalf of my visit. I had to run here (literally), my belly full of pork schnitzel (not joking), blood spewing from my nose (again, I don't lie much), just to quickly snatch an Almond Croissant before they closed. Was it worth it? Is that even a question? 

For me the only obvious comparison was Gaby et Jules, since I haven't been to Jean-Marc yet. They differ greatly. If Gaby is a piece of marble, then Gourmi is a brick. Not a bad thing, just way different, less polished. With comfort food instead of edible art (albeit art that is incredibly fine-tasting). La Gourmandine is soft and calm and specializes in similarly designed bread based pastries. So I don't know what else and how else to say other than this: the Almond Croissant is absolutely stunning. It was a thing of dreams. Dreams that take place in the hearts of Frenchmen and Lawrencevillians alike. 

Buuut, (here it comes; it wasn't quite perfect) the La Gourmandine people seemed slightly grumpy, especially when compared to the shine-your-shoes-just-for-buying-a-macaron grade of service at Gaby et Jules. And speaking of which, La Gourmandine's were far from perfect. Too crunchy and sugary; better stick with the the croissants. So I still like Gaby a bit better. (I'm sorry, ok!) Really, Gaby and Gourmi together is less of a comparison and more of a conclusion. Between the two, they have everything you might ever want. All ye Pittsburghers have no excuse to not be so happy."}
{"text":"I stopped by to ogle the fresh pastries and purchased a cream puff that was a treat for my husband and I. I also purchased a tuna sandwich for lunch that was absolutely heavenly. I saw a couple enjoying a cappuccino and croissant and I was seriously jealous. I need to go back and try the chocolate croissant!!"}
{"text":"This place is AH-mazing! I live just a few blocks away so I have to reign it in with the amount of trips we make there. I haven't had bread this good since I lived in Paris! Their veggie sandwiches are really great, too! The only thing I'm not super keen on is the macaroons- there's a place in Market Sq. I prefer to get them from, but other than that, this place literally cannot.be.beat!!!"}
{"text":"Decent food, horrible service, specifically from the manger. I came with a friend, he ordered a sandwich, I ordered a quiche, to eat in. They gave me utensils. I took one bite of the quiche, it was cold. Obviously it's meant to be eaten warm. I went right back and asked the cashier if he could heat it for me. He was very nice and took it and was about to do it, when the manager, not even looking at me, asked him (right there in front of me): did she eat from it? I said: I took a bite and found it cold. She told him (again i'm standing right there), you can't heat it. Poor guy was just standing awkwardly not knowing what to do. She said it's a health hazard (contamination). Now I'm all for avoiding cross-contamination. I told her I never put the fork back in the pie. I literally took the bite off my fork and came right back to get it heated. How is putting a pie in the microwave or whatever they heat it in going to contaminate everything. She would not even look at me actually and was being extremely disrespectful. The cashier was still holding the pie and not knowing what to do. There was a line of people and I was getting choked up because I was actually shocked that this was happening. I finally took the quiche from the guy and left. Never came back. That was about a year ago. I still felt compelled to write this review because I drive by this place every day on the way home and never want to go back in. The food is not worth being treated poorly."}
{"text":"I've been to Paris a handful of times. I lived there for a summer when I was 17. Never, have I had French pastries, croissants, or bread as good outside of the city of lights. 

My fiancee and I went there this morning for the first time and were blown away. We ordered a quiche, a loaf of rye bread, a butter croissant, a pain au chocolat (chocolate croissant), and  a pain au raisin, (a pastry with raisins...my favorite). Each was delicious. The quiche was light and fluffy (like it should be). The croissants were filled with enough butter to make them melt in your mouth. And the bread (which we tried at home) was crunchy on the outside, soft on the inside, and delicious all around.

I can't express how excited I am that we now have an authentic and outstanding French bakery in Pittsburgh. If only it were in Squirrel HIll (where I live) and not in Lawrenceville. I guess we'll have to make more trips out that way!"}
{"text":"A friend and I went on a sunny Saturday morning, and the line stretched outside the store and extended past the next store. While waiting I secretly hated all the customers coming out with their pretty white boxes full of pastries. 
The worst part was when I was forced to wait in the door of the bakery, the sweet buttery smells wafted through the air and caresses my nostrils. 
I couldn't help myself but spend an exorbitant amount of money (I'm sure you will too). Money was the only thing getting in the way of me and every patisserie there. 
I got the delice de pistache, croissant, pain de chocolat, and and almond croissant. Needless to say I ate them all in one sitting. The croissant was perfectly flaky on the outside and sickly doughy on the inside. Everything was gone in less than 5 minutes, leaving me with an empty box, and an array of smeared napkins strewn around my feet.  
I stared longingly at the bakery, regretting the fact that I didn't get more...

TLDR: get everything or you will regret it."}
{"text":"The best bakery I've ever been to! Highly
Recommend the Almond Croissant, Ham & Cheese croissant (have them warm it up!) and any of the Tarts!"}
{"text":"Came by for breakfast and grabbed an almond croissant. It was amazing. I'm pretty sure I've never had a better croissant in my life."}
{"text":"The decor is great, everything is laid out very cleanly so you can easily see their pastries, breads and desserts. I went back recently, and they removed their seating, which I liked but I understand that space can be quite tight when they're busy.

I feel that their highlights are their pastries. Croissants are phenomenal, anything with butter and sugar is baked perfectly. Sweets are elegantly put together and actually very sweet. Perhaps you should take an insulin syringe with you just in case you get too large of a sugar spike... (just kidding) but seriously they're very good.

What i didn't like was their baguette. I bought baguettes on separate occasions and both were overly salted and a bit dense. I was really hoping for something with a more open crumb. Perhaps both days I went were off days, but I usually go for their pastries and sweets, and occasionally to bask in the pretentiousness of a bakery that wants to be known as French."}
{"text":"hands down. one of the best places in pittsburgh. i love this place so much. i have tried to find other amazing french pastry shops in other cities. the only place i have found one that compares to the caliber of La Gourmandine is in NYC, all else fail the test. 
these folks totally spoil pittsburgh and i am so grateful!!!!"}
{"text":"The best croissants in Pittsburgh.  The coffee was good too!"}
{"text":"I'm so unbelievably sad that they stopped making kouign aman, but I guess I can forgive them because the la gourmandise and the tuna baguettes are so good. 
The tuna baguette is just simple tuna salad with cucumber, tomato, red onion, and mayo on a perfectly crunchy/chewy baguette. A simple lunch that would have a difficult time being more delicious.
They do have a cocktail table where you can stand and eat your pastry or sandwich, or you can go to the park across the street and enjoy some of the rare pittsburgh sunshine. Or, if your like me, you can drag your preggers self to your car and devour the entire baguette while other drivers stare at you. I promise not to judge!"}
{"text":"This is the best bakery in Pittsburgh. Nothing to add that other reviewers haven't mentioned already: The croissants are very, very good (particularly the croissant auxes almande), the tarte au citron is almost perfect with the beautiful lemon acidity balanced with the sweet richness of the shell, the mini tarte tatins and tarte au poire are fantastic, and the mille feuille and opera pastries are decadent without being cloying. The only thing I can think of to improve is to add an espresso counter (apologies if I missed it). Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"This place is beautiful and delicious... plus, the people who work there are very nice! It's an overwhelming place to walk into... you're smacked in the face by dozens of pieces of edible art and it's hard to decide which to get. Many people agree with me so be prepared for lines at peak times (like weekend mornings). The coffee is okay, though... just okay. But that's not why you're there!"}
{"text":"This bakery and pastry shop is consistently delightful in every way!!   It's such a wonderful addition to Pittsburgh's culinary choices!! I frequently go well out of my way to indulge in their delectable selections. I lament the fact that they are rather far off the path of my regular travels. This may be a blessing, however, as I would otherwise fear for my waistline!  For sweet treats to savory eats, you don't want to miss this place! And no matter what else seduces your palate, add a few butter croissants to your order - they're by far some of the best I've had outside of France. Bon appétit!!"}
{"text":"Dear delightful french bakery next door. Your hours suck. And you need to stop playing coy and open on Sunday. I mean seriously? Tuesday can eff off. I need a pastry and some delicious coffee on Sunday morning. Also, I love your baguettes and sandwiches. This is one of those places that will bring joy to your heart. (Assuming your heart is also closed on Sunday)"}
{"text":"What's not to love about a little French bakery with macarons?! A friend and I stopped here after some shopping at No. 14 boutique right up the street. The sales associates recommended it and said there is always a line out the door. We showed up and as she said there was a like out the door. But no worries it moves very quickly! Due to the fact I just had brunch I opted to only get 3 of their macarons and 1 of their larger macarons. They were all gone within minutes. The large macaron I got was a raspberry macaron with cream and raspberries layered on the inside. It was by far the best macaron I have had. They also had a lot of sandwiches and pastries that looked heavenly that I would like to go back and try one of these days."}
{"text":"Go! This place will make you feel like Amelie. The owners are friendly, the prices are reasonable, and the pastries will make you wet."}
{"text":"Can't top all that's already been written about this place, so I'm just going to say. Yes. Go here. Why? Nice people. Delicious pastries. What more do you need? 

I'd be 200 pounds if this was in my neighborhood because I would put hundreds of those chouquettes into my face every day. Thank you!"}
{"text":"This bakery offers really authentic French pastries!! 
Although the desserts were not mindblowing, they were very decadent and very well prepared.
We went there and spent $25 to get a sample of everything: pastries (the plain croissants, pain au chocolat and the chocolate and eggs braid -- don't recall its french name), desserts (lemon tartelette, a chocolate semi-froid with ganache on top and a raspberry bavaroise) and the bread. Out of all these, i truly recommend the plain croissants, the chocolate braids and the lemon tartelette: they were really really good! finally, one place in pittsburgh made me feel we don't need to miss europe for pastries. :)"}
{"text":"SETTING:
Cute little french pastry shop with a clean and cozy interior. A handful of tables (about four) that seat two people each. Not a very big place, so probably best to get things to go or come during off hours if you want to eat here. I heard lines can get pretty long which would crowd the bakery quickly.

PASTRIES:
I think they only make a certain amount each day, so once they're sold out (which happens) then you're out of luck. To me, this speaks to the quality and freshness.

Got me the Almond Croissant that was recommended by a friend. Excuse me while I wipe the white powder that is sugary goodness off my lips. 

Personally, I don't like things that are super sweet (ie: I dilute my fruit juices with water to cut down on the sugar...don't judge me!). This pastry was just about right on the sweet-o-meter. A tad bit on the sweet side though, so I cut it in half to save for later. I don't think I would be able to finish the whole thing in one sitting without feeling guilty or bouncing off the walls from the sugar high. My friends who got the almond croissant all raved about it, and I agree. No doubt, it was delicious. Parts of the base/bottom tasted a bit doughy though, but it wasn't a big deal...maybe that's how its supposed to be? I'd definitely get the croissant again and try the other pastries.

SERVICE:
Very polite, warm, and patient people working in the shop. Gave some good recommendations about their offerings. Classy establishment with classy people. 

IMPRESSIONS:
I'd love to come back and try the other pastries! Reasonably priced and delicately made. If you ever want to \"treat yoself,\" stop by and check it out. I already feel a withdrawl coming on...uh oh. It would be dangerous if they delivered."}
{"text":"The girlfriend got me a flourless chocolate cake from here for my birthday and it was divine. Would highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"We stopped here a few times while we stayed in Pittsburgh.

Everything we tried was GOOD. We wanted to try more, but we ran out of time. Highly recommended!

I think the only downside is that it's kind of small. We stopped to grab a coffee and have a sandwich one morning and standing around at the tables isn't always fun."}
{"text":"The quality and authenticity of this bakery . . . Second to none in this city. Honestly, the value of these baked goods is incredible. I pride myself on being a connoisseur (ehmm, French) of the croissant. And this bakery's croissant . . . My goodness. It's like I've died and have gone back to . . . Cambodia (I've never been to France, but the Cambodians make some mean French pastries)? They have multiple varieties that are all delicious. Perfectly buttery. Perfectly flaky. Perfectly delicious. Oui!!! 

Get a croissant. 

Also, buy everything else in their nice display case. Everything is so visually appealing. These baked goods are like works of art. And the tastes perfectly match the quality of the appearances.

The shop itself is also very nice. It's very quaint. Very charming. Honestly, I was half expecting Meg Ryan and Tom Hanks to show up to split a piece of quiche. You walk in and have to honestly ask yourself, \"Am . . . am I in France?\" 

Yeah. You're not. But you might as well be. 

If you enjoy quality baked goods at great prices, stop at La Gourmandine. You won't be disappointed. Everything from the employees to the shop to the goods themselves is so, oh, so inviting."}
{"text":"I absolutely love La Gourmadine Bakery! I've been here several times, always on a Saturday morning. There is always a line of people waiting to get their favorites. Ive never been to any other locations. My favorites are the breakfast pastries including the abricotine and croissant aux amandes. I highly recommend both if you like breakfast pastries. The croissants are also deliciously flakey and buttery. Macaroons and torts are always amazing! I haven't had a thing I didn't like! 

The interior is small but with a few tables to sit at if you want to eat your goodies there! Staff has always been nice but I do feel a little rushed sometimes when there is a line and they are trying to move you along. I don't recommend getting in line until you know what you want!"}
{"text":"Delicious.  

But don't go because I don't want you clogging up the store, creating a long line and possibly taking the last of my favorite pastry."}
{"text":"Yum! Tempting selection of breads, pastries, savory sandwiches, and more!  So glad we stopped here."}
{"text":"we had quiche lorraine and the quiche with spinach/goat cheese (my mother and i just ate lunch here today) - both were really delicious- portions were good and priced at $5 (including a drink) each was pretty good. no tables to sit and eat at inside...which was a bummer since i had my 9 month old with me and i was carrying him, but other than that it was great. there are 3 standing tables inside...no seating. i'd eat here again in a heartbeat (and i will!)"}
{"text":"Dare I say this reminds me of an actual Parisian bakery? Minimal standing only high tables with just a few outdoor seats facing the street. The set up is definitely authentic, so right off the bat I have a good feeling about this. 

La Gourmandine offers traditional French pastries, baked goods, and a few savory items. Unfortunate there's only so much real estate my stomach can muster in one sitting, so I go with the quiche Lorraine, croissant au beurre(plain), and croissant almande(almond). 

Quiche Lorraine: I generally am not a fan of quiche(only because they would be 10 times better if served warm) but this is super tasty. Bacon, Caramelized onions, and eggs. What's not to love?!

Croissant au beurre: to be honest, I've never had a croissant stateside that tastes anything like an actual Parisian version, but this is pretty good 

Croissant almande: I chose to save the best for last. I actually fell in love with almond croissants at a Belgian restaurant in NYC. That was the best I ever had. After trying dozen all over, I found another excellent version in Ottawa, Ontario. A dozen or so terrible versions later, I stumble on la Gourmandine! Not the traditional croissant, as it basically looks like it's been flattened, but amazing nonetheless. The filling is not too sweet, the powdered sugar is not overkill, and the almonds are plentiful. Yes, all that matters. 

Oh and the staff themselves? Exceptional! Not only patient and helpful, but quite gracious. I ended up leaving the \"to go\" portion of my order in a bag on one of the outside tables. Not only did they hold it for me until I returned, but they without me asking, decided to give me new pastries just in case someone tampered with it. Now that's how you win a customer! 

Nowhere really feels like Paris but Paris itself; but in terms of bakeries, this is pretty darn close"}
{"text":"Finally tried this bakery which has been on my list for quite some time during the Lawrenceville Cookie Tour.

I'm giving it 4 vs. 5 stars because with all the hype and praise, I thought it would have more selections.  It's a rather small bakery with a small selection.  Mind you, what they do have and what I tried was very good; I was just expecting more.

I had a chocolate éclair and some almond concoction.  Both were excellent.

Staff is friendly, helpful, and efficient so if there's a line; be patient.  It goes fast and is worth the wait."}
{"text":"I'm in love with this place. One thing I love about France is the plethora of pastry/bakery shops.  I was happy to learn about this place from my colleagues, and ever since my first visit, I've been trying to come here every weekend to get my fix for croissants and other pastries.

Food (10/10) = I haven't had anything I didn't like.  The croissants are my favorite item so far.  Buttery, flaky, fluffy pillows of tongue pleasure.  What more could you want, other than a hot cup of coffee to go with it?  Killer combo.  Other things I've enjoyed are Pain au chocolat ou Chocolatine, Pain de Campagne , and the Focaccia.  One of the things I enjoyed about France were the sandwiches.  Le Parisien and Le Montagnard bring back great memories.  And the Marquise...wtf? Dark chocolate mousse with crème brûlée and crispy caramel?  What genius came up with this innovation?

Ambiance (8/10) = beautiful presentation of the pastries.  Small, cozy feel with brick walls.  Wish there were more tables/seats.

Service (8/10) = good service.  standard. smiling.

Overall Opinion = What a gem.  Great place for baked goods period.  Always looking forward to my next visit to La Gourmandine."}
{"text":"I absolutely love this bakery.  On this trip I decided to try the chocolate eclair. It was a chocolate lovers delight filled with chocolate mousse and topped with chocolate icing. It was the perfect pairing with my cup of coffee."}
{"text":"Recently had wandered in to pick up some macarons. I did get there late in the day so very few were left (hence only 4 stars), but what they did have were giant (twice the size) raspberry and lychee macarons. They were cooked PEREFCTLY, had a great balance between the sweet lychee cream, raspberry cookie and fresh raspberries in the cream. Tremendously delicious. I highly recommend this French bakery, but suggest not waiting for the afternoon to roll around."}
{"text":"Came to Pittsburgh for a visit and a friend took us here. Wow, everything was amazing in this cute little shop. I ordered a French macroon sandwich (that's right) filled with custard and raspberries that was perfect. My friends ordered some type of cinnamon roll and a cream puff. Everything was beautifully crafted and well balanced. We arrived near the end of the day, so lots of their breads were sold out, so make sure you arrive earlier in the day for the best selection."}
{"text":"La Gourmandine will get you laid. If she's never been there, take her. She will be amazed w your city knowledge and terrible French pronunciations. You're so cultured.

Incredible pastries and everything else. When I say incredible, I mean 'knock your socks off good.' If they have turkey sandwiches when you're there, get one... The bread is kinda tough but that's how I like it.

Go here, you will be converted and want to come back."}
{"text":"Le Gourmandine is your Pittsburgh destination for buttery, delicious French pastries as well as some of the best bread you can get your hands on.  If you hate to wait, show up early, as the line has been known to snake out of the front door and around the block, but trust me, it's worth it.

I have visited on multiple occasions and tried nearly everything, but a few standouts: the basic croissant is airy and flaky, but the brioche is out of this world.  With a few options to try, you can find the brioche that fits your fancy: filled with cream or dripping in sticky syrup and covered in almond slivers are the two that I love most.  Their baguettes are also fantastic.  A crunchy exterior with a tender crumb is excellent for a sandwich or for sopping up extra sauce.  They don't last long, however, so make sure to eat the whole thing the same day you buy it.. Which isn't very hard.

If you're in need of a larger format sweet, their tarts are unparalleled, with crispy crusts, silky custards, and the freshest fruit you could ask for.  I would consume all my fruits on top of their tarts if I could.."}
{"text":"Finally, a real bakery. I have been trying to find good croissants in Pittsburgh and La Gourmandie did not disappoint. I had a ham and cheese croissant that was nice and buttery. Definitely going back to try the pastries, which look phenomenal. I only wish there was a place to sit and enjoy, although if it is a nice day, it's a good spot to walk around. Coffee wasn't great, so maybe go to Espresso A Mano for a nice cappuccino first."}
{"text":"I have to be honest. I JUST don't get the hype. First off, a patisserie should have an espresso machine (not coffee that you would find in your office break room). In addition, they should offer (and maybe they do?) tea. Coke and croissant? I don't think so... The quiche was runny and I'm now worried about salmonella and the croissant aux amandes was very heavy. My friend felt that his pain au chocolat needed more pain and less beurre. However, my roommate, who has studied in both France and West Africa, really enjoyed her pain aux raisin."}
{"text":"Hands down one of the best parts of Pittsburgh. This is the first stop when I show anyone around the city. Brie tarts have never disappointed. 

Ambiance: very quaint little store front that gets crowded very quickly. If the line is out the door, they like/expect to keep the door closed and have the line continue to form outside so always dress accordingly. No indoor seating, but has a few outdoor seats if you're lucky enough to grab one during the summer. Fortunately, Lawrenceville is a great place to walk around especially on Butler Street. It's also across the street from a park with plenty of benches and swing sets. Not a place where they love to recommend things, they like to keep the line moving so decide what you want before you get up to order. One of everything is never a bad call. 

Food: The Brie Tart is hands down one of my favorite items in all of pittsburgh. Extremely unique with a fluffy Pasteur wrapped around slices of Brie and onion. Pain au Chocolat, Croissant aux Amandes, and all other pastries are delicious, I try something new every time depending on what I am in the mood for. Bacon Baguette is one of my favorite breads, it is exactly what it sounds like, you really cant go wrong. 

Convenience: Hours can be odd but always easy to swing by on the weekends."}
{"text":"What a delightful find!! My only regret is not stopping here sooner. On a Saturday morning, I waited in line nearly 30 minutes to get inside. It was worth the wait! The staff was helpful. Looking at all of the delicious breads and pastries it was hard to decide what to select! Such visually appealing foods! My husband and son loved everything I bought. Can't wait to come back and try different selections and also try their sandwiches / soups."}
{"text":"Some of these reviews are fairly wordy, so I'll keep this simple:

La Gourmandine is a small shop in a nice area--there's a table outside and a table or two inside. The coffee is hot, the bread is unbelievable, and the quiche is to die for. I suggest the salmon quiche, but all of the flavors are always excellent.

The people behind the counter are friendly and combine everything with affordable prices, and you have a returning customer out of me.

Any foodie in Pittsburgh looking for a nice morning pastry should definitely go here."}
{"text":"As soon as you open the door you could be stepping into a pâtisserie in France. The smells knocks you out - so delicious. I've been in a couple of times - picking up fresh croissants - perfect, flakey and buttery goodness. The tarts are outstanding - citron especially and the sandwiches are outstanding as well. A top hit in town with a seriously helpful and friendly staff."}
{"text":"I. Love. La Gourmandine!

It has to be a special treat for me to make my way within their business hours... but I've found plenty of reasons to celebrate with special treats from there! Birthdays, wedding, friends visiting from out of town, Tuesdays.... you get the picture! 

Call ahead for the raspberry tart, I learned it was seasonal - but it is the most amazing thing I've had, maybe ever. Other favorites include the lemon tart (YASS!) and nearly anything made of chocolate. 

The shop is small and offers little seating so I've mostly boxed my goodies up and taken them home (or to parties) to enjoy. They have been good for days after parties (I've had to force myself to make them last longer, but a piece a day for a week... what a great week!)"}
{"text":"great chef, excellent pastries. i have almond allergies and can't try all of their food but everything i had was excellent. their sandwiches are amazing and a great price. i do not go as often but anytime i am in the area i stop by"}
{"text":"Amazing! I've been to France 4 times, I've lived in NYC and Philly and love french desserts. This place is top notch. Incredible flavor, presentation, and consistency. The employees are friendly and well trained. Lines out the door are well worth it here."}
{"text":"Delicious! Amazing! The pastries are unbelievable, surprisingly great coffee too. Only complaint is that they are not open on Sunday."}
{"text":"Oh my. This place is GREAT.

My mother and I recently went out for a day of sweets and treats, and this was our top stop.  We also went to Prantls in Shadyside and it did not even compare.  

I had at least 5 different kinds of tarts and pastries and they were all delicious.  The raspberry tart was excellent, and they also made this snowman looking thing.  It comes in chocolate and vanilla, and the vanilla  one was absolutely amazing.  

There was literally not a single pastry in that place that I wouldnt eat.  I plan on going back next week for more treats.  Also the work staff was very pleasant."}
{"text":"Did it feel like Paris? Yes. Did it smell like Paris? Yes. Did I never want to leave? Yes.

Sadly...I had to. 

I was in awe with the beautiful abundance of baked goods along with a wide selection of pastries I have never seen before! I bought way too much for my drive back to DC. Macarons, Croissants, sandwiches, etc. All perfect! 

Tucked away on Butler street, this pastry shop shines above the rest and ensures quality over quantity!"}
{"text":"This is a frequent stop for lunch for me. The wait staff is always super friendly and the food is always spot on. I have tried a number of their lunches and I always treat my something to a yummy french tart and I have never been disappointed. I particularly like their tuna fish sandwich which is served on a crispy french baguette and is the perfect blend of tuna and fresh vegetables - sweet onion, celery, cucumber. It is served with lettuce and tomato. It leaves me filling full but not bloated.

For a special treat, call ahead for their Fraisier cake. It is one of the most amazing deserts I have ever tried."}
{"text":"If someone brings you a dessert from this place, they LOVE you. That is the lesson I learned this past weekend. Long story made short - someone who was definitely interested in the birthday girl brought a cake from this bakery to her party and every person at the party could not stop talking about how special this bakery is and gave raving reviews of the dessert before they even tasted it....I then tasted it and learned why these party goers reacted they way they did. Hands down, the most decadent chocolate cake I have ever experienced."}
{"text":"La Gourmandine is part bakery, part patisserie, and they do a very good job at both. They stay within limits; no extravagant, overstuffed breads or pastries. Just the basics, plus a few things here and there. Everything that I've tried here (two visits) is simple, fresh, and delicious. Sandwiches are terrific and a great value. Decor is minimalist and there's almost no seating, but you can eat in the park across the street. Strongly recommended."}
{"text":"I have been looking forward to going to La Gourmandine for the past month. When I tried going there the first time, I got there five minutes after they closed and I was devastated so you can imagine my excitement when I finally walked into the store.

I have seen, been, and tasted my fair share of French pastries because I frequent NYC often and I can say that La Gourmandine can be comparable to any famous NYC French bakery. The time I chose to go there resulted in a long line which allowed me to decide what I wanted since I wanted to get everything. In the end, I picked the abricotine while my friend got the pain au chocolat ou chocolatine. As I am writing this review, I'm actually salivating for abricotine. It was the perfect combination of flaky croissant, pastry cream, and dollop of apricot jam. I also got the chance to try the chocolate filled croissant and also loved it. The chocolate inside was soft which allowed it to seep into the nooks and crannies of the croissant dough. 

One suggestion I would like to make to the owners is to move the chairs and tables from inside the store to outside. When I was waiting in line, the tables and chairs were a hindrance and by moving them outside, people would have a place to sit, eat their pastries, and enjoy the outside weather.

This is the place in Pittsburgh for French pastries and can beat many of the French pastry shops I've gone in NYC. I do not doubt that anything they make delicious!"}
{"text":"Bright and cozy french bakery with a wide array of delicious eats. This was my first visit to the actual bakery, whereas I usually get the treats when my husband brings something home. This time we opted for the Mini Eclairs au Chocolat (Choux dough filled with cocoa chocolate custard and topped with chocolate fondant) and the Choux a la Crème (Choux dough cut in half and filled with homemade vanilla whipped cream). The was a bit surprised by the size of Choux a la Creme, but oh it was so heavenly! It's a generous dessert size treat (you could probably split it via twisting it like an Oreo). The filling has a nice creamy mouth feel, with the slightest hint of vanilla. The choux dough was nice and crisp several hours after picking it up. The flecks of the vanilla bean were easily seen, which was a nice surprise.

The bakery is bright and clean, with a few tables to enjoy your sweet or savory selections at (quiche, sandwiches etc.)"}
{"text":"One of the best bakeries in the 'burgh, or anywhere for that matter.  Everything is superb and the staff excellent."}
{"text":"Amazing pastries! Breads to die for!
As soon as you walk in the smell transports you to a pattiserie in Paris!
Service is alright... They are really busy, so there's not a lot of time for them to interact or take that extra time.... 
The lack of coffee drinks like lattes or cappuccinos is a downer...."}
{"text":"I still love La Gourmandine, but I feel that the overall quality and consistency of their bread is not as great as it used to be.  The pastries are all still pretty delicious, for the most part.  As for the bread, I'm not sure if it's just because I've now been spoiled by better baguettes (see: Five Points Artisan Bakeshop) and other amazing bread (see: Bread & Salt) or if the quality has actually declined.  I still occasionally get baguettes and sandwiches here because they're conveniently located in my neighborhood, but they just don't move me like it feels like they once did.

The service is very friendly and competent; I love all the folks who work here.  It's great that they have seasonal pastries, too.  Always a fun treat!  Get here early on Saturday and Sunday mornings, as the line sometimes goes out the door by 9am or so!"}
{"text":"Loved their almond croissant! It's so much more than just a croissant... there's sweet breading on top as well. There wasn't as much selection (perhaps because I came on a Saturday around noon?) but on  smells amazing in La Gourmandine. I saw them regularly bring out new pastries and desserts as well!"}
{"text":"This is an amazing bakery. The baguettes alone are to die for, not to mention all the other delicious goodies for sale. This place is truly top notch and as good as any bakery anywhere."}
{"text":"The heavenly aroma that hits when you walk in the door is the first sign of a good bakery. The second is the colorful and gorgeously disayed pastries. I had such a hard time deciding that I went with what I found fascinating based on the reviews here - the Marquise. Although photos show a long chocolate bar, they modified it to a cute, round mini cake. And it was delicious, wow. The outside was slightly \"harder\" than the buttery chocolate mousse inside, although it was soft enough to fork through easily. The creme brulee custard had the perfect tinge of vanilla. Since I didnt really read the description online, the crispy caramel on the bottom and the yellow cake inside took me by pleasant surprise. All in all, I enjoyed the experience very much. Unfortunately I took so long to eat it that it became cloying, but it tasted wonderful for the first half!

I also ordered a Choquette that was a hollow piece of dough and sprinkled with rock sugar pieces. It was good dough, but nothing fancy, though only 39 cents!

Despite the location being a hassle to travel to, I will be back!"}
{"text":"Did they change ownership?  I recently had the almond croissant and the almond filling felt...heavy handed.  

I need answers.  Tell me.  Tell me, now."}
{"text":"When I think of the French, I think of this incredible, long-lost band...

http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EuoMIQ8FgKo&feature=related

...and an excellent, socialized health care system and people filling the streets when employers screw with them in any way. 

Methinks they won't be playing any Sortilege in La Gourmandine. Or Gojira for that matter...

http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPXV4vUDlqs&feature=fvst

Enough with the plugging of my heavy musical tastes. I just wanted to show people that I'm not one of those idiots who bag on or stereotype the French.

In a way, I was guilty of that also since I assumed that their food would be a little overpriced and that La Gourmandine would be yet another example of gentrification in Lawrenceville. I.E. \"We want the neighborhood people out!\"

In actuality, La Gourmandine fits in as nicely as Cigna's once did, and they even have some pretty wallet-friendly lunch and breakfast deals. Have a look...

http://lagourmandinebakery.food.officelive.com/Formule.aspx

Blue-collar me showed up to get a pre-shift bite and found a busy storefront with an eclectic clientele, including a baby walking on the floor and an elderly lady who was just eating up all the attention she was getting from the two on-the-ball young women behind the counter. 

She eh, \"couldn't figure out what she wanted\" yet made small talk the entire time.  You know the type, and so did the girls, who gave me knowing smirks and glances. 

Me? I needed to be out of there fast, so I ordered a Le Pêcheur and a French Brest...to go. Name the David Lee Roth video I just referenced and win a plastic Green Lantern ring from me. I'll getcha when I getcha.

Le Pêcheur is the kind of long, skinny grinder you can't get at Subway. A baguette houses their good but slightly dry tuna salad that includes tomato slices, onion, cucumber, and lemon. 

People make it seem as if everything French is dainty, but man, this was one tough sandwich. Is baguette supposed to be like this? Usually, when I've had this type of bread, it was softer. LG's bread, on the other hand, was like a Sahs Side pretzel, man. I was fightin' this zep, wrestlin' it to the ground in order to finish it. That's not to say I didn't like it; it was capably appetizing, but I do honestly prefer a sandwich that is somewhat easier to chew as well as a wetter tuna salad. Nothing about this sandwich was a deal breaker though, and I wouldn't mind having it again. 

Now, you know I snagged myself a dessert. 

Have you ever seen the film \"Young Sherlock Holmes?\"  Remember when Watson was hallucinating after being drugged and thought that all of those exquisite French pastries were attacking him? 

I checked the back of my neck for a blowdart. 

Go rent it if you haven't seen it. Terrific movie. 

Anyway, I gawked and drooled at their dessert case like it was a burlesque show. La Gourmandine really makes their confections into art, so much so that you want to study your treat for a minute before chowing down. I had a bit of trouble deciding, almost playing it safe with a chocolate eclair, until I saw their French Brest, the whoopie pie of French pastries. 

Meanwhile, back at work, a conversation occurs...

\"What kinda sammich is that, man?\"

\"I forget the name of it.\" 

\"Dat looks good. Where'd ju get it?\" 

Walking around a warehouse dock with a fancy French dessert will make the goonies curious, especially when you're making guttural noises and swaying like Stevie Wonder. 

Of course our resident Teabagger had to make a smart remark under his breath.

\"Boycott them until they call themselves Freedom Bakery.\" 

\"Boycott THIS you %^$#@,\" I bellowed, fist clenched, a lone middle digit standing at attention.

So well-engineered it was that the chocolate mocha (?) cream (they have vanilla too) didn't shoot out from the sides as the choux was just right in terms of pliability. It also served as an example of how a dessert doesn't have to be richly sweet to be a palate-pleaser. 

Showdown On Butler Street

The wind blows a page of The City Paper across the black asphalt road. It is quiet. Cemetery quiet. Midnight quiet. 

La Gourmandine and Dozen Bakery stand facing each other grasping pistols. La Gourmandine wears a brown hat with white trim, Dozen wears a light blue hat with a darker blue trim. 

They turn their backs to each other and are to take their 12 paces, but Dozen, being dastardly, turns and fires after 6...merely grazing La Gourmandine, barely leaving a mark. Dozen then feels a chill in the back of the neck and turns to run, never hearing the bullet that ended this duel and filled another grave. 

Meet La Gourmandine, the new Sheriff of Lawrenceville."}
{"text":"My wife and I came to La Gourmandine this morning after years of saying we'd go on a weekend morning. Yes, there was a long line.

I've had excellent things from them, including an outstanding cake for my birthday earlier this year that my dad picked up for us.

Today, we tried a wide variety of treats, from pain au chocolat, an abricotine, an feuilleté aux pommes and 2-3 other pastries that looked good. Considering the excellent reputation, we thought they were just \"okay.\"

Personally, I thought the pain au chocolat tasted like it was made last night. It was good, but Five Points has a much better version - simply because it always seems to taste fresh. Same for the abricotine - tasy, but not outstanding.

While La Gourmandine has a wonderful variety, good service, and I'll probably give it another shot, I'd say I give better marks to Five Points for the croissants and pain au chocolate.

Hopefully, we just visited on an off day."}
{"text":"I am so disappointed. We just left. We got assorted pastries and macarons. They were absolutely beautifully looking, but were significantly lacking in flavor. 

We visited another French bakery in Squirrel Hill a couple days ago and were craving more. Their macarons and chocolate croissants were life changing. We've been wanting more, but it's difficult to get to. We saw the good reviews on yelp and thought we'd give this place a try since we were passing by. 

The macarons lacked flavor to the point of it being hard to distinguish what flavor each was. 

The pastries seemed to either be over or under baked. None were just right. Some tasted eggy and had a rawish center while others left an unpleasant burnt taste in our mouths. 

Next time we want French pastries, we will make the drive to squirrel hill instead."}
{"text":"Stopped by to get some treats for Mother's Day.  Everything was excellent.  From the Frasier, macaron au fruit, to the almond croissant and even the pain de pie for sandwiches.  Tried the focaccia garnie that was scrumptious. Never disappointed in our selections.  If you come on a Saturday or Sunday morning there is usually a line but it doesn't take to long.  Surprised they don't have two cash registers on some of those days to move the line faster."}
{"text":"I rarely give 5 star for a place I've only tried once, but this one definitely takes the cake. And the cookies. And the pastries. And pretty much everything else possible. UNFFFF is all I have to say. My mom, BF, and I decided to visit here after already being semi in the neighborhood. The girl behind the counter was friendly and answered all of our retard questions. (I fail at anything remotely French language related...except food...and even then, I fail pretty hard.) 

We got a pistachio....hoagie-looking-thing (which was amazing btw, had essence of coconut to it), a lemon tart which was OUT of this world sour and amazing....and we also tried a chocolate dome shaped thing. Everything we got was fantastic. My mom also bought a plain croissant and a chocolate croissant for my sister. I tried a bite of the plain one and it blew my mind.

Seriously....the local French bakery in St. Louis ain't got nothin' on this place. The baker is clearly highly skilled and the ingredients they use here are very clearly TOP NOTCH. As someone who is an avid bakery and appreciator of fine French desserts, I can tell this place is money. Quality speaks volumes when it comes to baking! (Followed by science and practice, of course!)"}
{"text":"delicious and unique.  Worth a stop for anyone looking for a special treat or to try some authentic french desserts."}
{"text":"Perfect spot to grab a quick lunch and go. The bread is amazing. The quiche was buttery, eggy and light. Simply spectacular."}
{"text":"I usually go to the Lawrenceville location but I was out in Mt Lebanon and wanted a quick breakfast with my son. The location is really cute. It's very similar to the other location, but had parking. The food was exactly the same. My almost 2-year old scarfed down almost a whole order of chocquettes and I had an almond croissant with a cup of tea. There were a few more tables than Lawrenceville, I think, and we were happy to be able to grab one and enjoy our breakfast. It's nice that there are two locations to visit with the same quality at each."}
{"text":"If I could eat here everyday I would. I love the pain au chocolate for breakfast, the Parisian baguette for lunch and macarons or the marquis for dessert. My 16 month old loves the choquettes! The staff is always so friendly and the atmosphere reminds me so much of Paris. I can't recommend this place enough!"}
{"text":"Mmmmm. La Gourmandine. 

The yelp reviews did it justice. Lots of little baguettes and pastries filled this place. 

Our selection was a little sad- I mean, what do you expect for stopping in at 3pm on the Saturday of Labor Day weekend? But we split this chocolate eclair dessert- and mmmmmm. Oh how I love desserts. Nice and chocolate-y, yet not overally sweet? Mmmmmm.

Had we had been more hungry and had we come earlier, we totally would have gotten more. Definitely worth the stop..... :)"}
{"text":"Disclaimer: We only had a savory treat - and absolutely plan to visit again for something sweet. Everything sure looks to die for...

I stopped in to the shop for a hangover breakfast of sorts. I had a simple le Parisien (French baguette with butter, ham, and Swiss cheese) - and it hit the spot! The baguette was among the best I've ever had; and, the ham, cheese, and butter were perfectly proportioned - fresh, tasty combo of great flavors. I can't wait to go back and sample some pastries!"}
{"text":"Pass this shop on my way home quite often so I have been wanting to try this place for a while! They do close pretty early so I was finally able to make it last week. La gourmadine did not disappoint. Their croissant was so flaky and buttery. The almond croissant did not look like a croissant but wow did it taste amazing. Every bite had flaky buttery almond goodness. The only thing I wasn't too impressed with was the spinach and goat cheese quiche. It was mediocre nothing special. The last thing I tried was the cream puff which was amazing. The cream was perfect not too thick or sweet and the pastry was perfect. Thank god I only bought one, I could have eaten four in one sitting. 

Overall, a wonderful bakery in the south hills. Will definitely make an effort to return for their decadent pastries!"}
{"text":"I gained like 5 lbs in 2 weeks stopping here everyday on the way to school last semester and it was worth it. Everything is so fresh, often you see them continually restocking the case right in front of you just-made items. The gourmandines are my favorite. It's like a chocolate croissant with custard and they're heavenly. If there's a line, it goes quick and it's worth it so just wait! I wish they were open right now (and delivered)"}
{"text":"We found out about this bakery thru Yelp.  We had been wanting to try out those almond croissants for quite some time.  We happened to be in the area on an early Saturday afternoon.  Unfortunately for us, they were out!  No croissants of any kind!   We opted for an apple pastry and a pistachio eclair.  Both were delicious.  Can't wait to visit, again."}
{"text":"Incredible French bakery in Lawrenceville - from the bagettes to macaroons to pastries and breads....delicious! Special cakes are also often available. The bakery sells sandwiches, soup and coffee too! You.won't.be.disappointed."}
{"text":"If you have been to France you are wrecked for all pastries and bread forever. If you haven't then go to La Gourmandine and you can have a similar experience! It's where we go to get our fix. It's all awesome. Just go."}
{"text":"Time to update! This place is just amazing! We have gone more than a few times now and it gets better and better hence going from a 4 star to a 5 star rating. If you are ever anywhere near (& by near I mean within a 50 mile radius) you must stop. It is a very tiny place but it doesn't have to be big. This little place packs a punch. The eclairs are just, wow! Never had any better...the chocolate is just so wonderful. I can't even describe it. It is just phenomenal! The pastries are light and fluffy and full of amazing flavor and tasty goodness. I would say right behind the eclairs is the chocolate fondue cake.. talk about the most moist chocolate cake we have ever had, wow! We haven't ever had anything bad and staff is always friendly and helpful. Again, I would recommend this place to anyone and everyone who would or will listen!"}
{"text":"La Gourmandine offers by far the best, most luscious cake that you can buy in Pittsburgh and the surrounding areas.

One of my friends gets these for all her parties and their wonders make me ecstatic every time.

Runners Up

According to both my own pastry-loving tastes and the inherited wisdom of my life-long Pittsburgher mother and aunts, the runners-up options for \"best cake in Pittsburgh\" are both more \"old-fashioned and sugary\" than La Gourmadine: Prantl's Burnt Almond Torte or the strawberry-layer cake from The Oakmont Bakery."}
{"text":"The best in the city, and if my 5-year-old had a vote, we'd be here everyday. I go here for coffee and macarons, or lunch because their sandwiches are great, simple meals. Try the pistachio éclair or the lemon tart."}
{"text":"So happy to have found a little piece of France in Pittsburgh! As a francophile and food-lover, i was excited to try this place out. It exceeded my expectations. The little shop mirrored the boulangeries in France. I ate the sandwich La Campagnard, which was a simple turkey sandwich on a baguette. Its simplicity, freshness, and texture made for an amazing gastronomic experience. I also sampled the Pistachio macaron which was reasonably priced and very good as well. Of course, i had to get a Baguette Tradition, which had an intoxicating smell and had the perfect consistency of crunchy and fluffy on the inside. 
Will definitely go back soon, and i suggest anyone who is visiting Pittsburgh must go here. 
The only downside was that there were only a couple of tables, and with the line forming into the street, not everyone could sit. Luckily, there is a park across the street."}
{"text":"MMM.  I can't say enough good things about La Gourmandine.  I love everything I've ever had from them 
quiche
almond croissant 
ham and cheese with bechamel croissant. 
and a dozen or so desserts.
Every single one - delicious"}
{"text":"I ummmm, might have a hard time finding the words to express how much I love the pastries I tried at this place.  

It's just a little 3 table bakery counter place, so don't go thinking you will linger for hours over your espresso cup.

The coffee is self-serve and quite decent.

Didn't try the bread. 

Now, it's all about the croissants.  Bought a chocolate for there and a pear tart to go.  I took one bit of the chocolate and immediately went back to the counter for an almond croissant.  Not because I didn't like the chocolate, but because I looooooved it and wanted moooooore.  Now, if love is what I felt for the chocolate croissant, the almond one, well the closest word might be l'amour.  French love.  Much stronger, more powerful.  I could only eat half.  The other half went home and was downed with the pear tart a few hours later.  As in, could not wait for the next day.

The place was so good I texted a picture of the almond croissant to a French friend in DC and promised her I would bring one the next time I am in town. She took one look at the pic and replied, \"Real deal.\""}
{"text":"My goodness, for a French pastry lover, I sure chose the wrong side of town to live on. Murrysville/Monroeville area only has 1 bakery and that's Moio's. No macarons for anyone! 15 miles and 45 minutes later with a car-full of hangry people, we arrived at this joint to devour all the breakfast pastries. 

The website talks about a lunch deal and there is no such thing. I also called asking about reservations and you know, maybe the lady could have helpfully told me there is no seating area at all. But nope, I go in expecting to order a lunch and eat it there but there's standing room only. I still made the most of the trip by ordering an assortment of pastries though. Here's my review of that:
-very fresh
-authentic assortment (no doughnuts allowed here!)
-taste was good

I tend to judge French bakeries based on their execution of the ubiquitous pain au chocolat. The appearance was puffy and magnificent. The taste was not bad--most of the pastry was air, but I did like that it was not as sweet as Panera's version. The smell though and the smell of the bakery itself was definitely lacking. I believe I had the pleasure of smelling most bakeries in Paris and they would completely astound passersby. The smell was so strong it was almost visceral, like imagining melting butter and flaky pastries...
The best thing here was the almond croissant thingies and why the heck did I only buy one? The cream puff was also amazeballs but next time I will skip the apricot tart and the coconut bread cupcake thing. Next time, bakery, we will meet again and I will treat this as a whole day trip."}
{"text":"I've been here a few times and I really like it. The almond croissants are fantastic. I haven't had the opportunity to try out their lunch options yet but I've heard from others that it's also great. Service has always been good. I love that they're open on Mondays, because most bakeries aren't. Parking is tough. The last time I've been there weren't any spots open and we had to park in the lot for the insurance office next door."}
{"text":"Paris! What can I say? I was thrilled that this French inspired bakery opened a second location in Mt Lebanon. They have their own parking but the lot is very small and of course filled. Across the street is an abandoned gas station where I would imagine you can park if need be.

Stopped here for lunch with my daughter. I ordered the goat cheese and spinach quiche while she settled for a ham and cheese on a French baguette. They advised me for dessert to get the almond danish which is filled with almond creme. It must have been very popular since I got the last one! I noticed later on they restocked them.

That sandwich of her's was so huge I thought there was no way she could finish it but she did. My quiche was heated and brought out to me. It was okay. I'm not used to goat cheese but it wasn't overly filling so I could enjoy my danish. That almond danish was very flaky and literally came apart on me as I ate it. It was delicious!  She had some sort of chocolate bar dessert which she let me sample. It was very rich and quite filling had I ordered it.

They only have a few tables if you wish to eat in. Take out is available and of course you can call if you want to preorder baked goods or their breads. 

The staff was very friendly and helpful. If you eat inside then your food is served on actual dishes and they will let you box up leftovers to take home. As we were leaving I purchased a fruit filled macaroon cookie for my daughter and a chocolate chip style danish for a friend. I was told that danishes will only last a day but does not need refrigeration while anything in their refrigerated case should be placed in the refrigerator once you get home.

This place is easy to miss since it sits near the corner of Cochran and Cedar roads. Still it made for a nice mid day treat for both of us. My advice would be to get there early for best selection. Will definitely visit it again sometime in the future."}
{"text":"While checking out the area for an upcoming event I stumbled upon the first location of La Gourmandine. I had no trouble parking and was pleasantly surprised to find it open on a Sunday morning.

I went in and like its sister shop over in Mt Lebanon, the layout is virtually the same. They are noted for their flaky almond pastries which I have had before. That alone is my number one recommendation! However, since I have had it twice I decided to try something different. So I asked the lady about some of the new items they had. One was called Clafoutis which is made out of bread pudding and stuffed with cherries. The other was lime Bavarian cream with raspberry. I ordered both since they told me I could store the Clafoutis in my refrigerator for one day.

They served my lime Bavarian cream on an actual plate with a fork. They also have a few tables where you can sit and eat. Again, they offer sandwiches as well as coffee or tea. You can also order cakes or pastries in advance. The staff was very helpful and explained everything to me.

That new lime Bavarian cream was delicious and not overly filling which was perfect for me!  I plan on eating the Clafoutis later but I'm sure since they recommended it to me, I know I won't be disappointed. When I had finished eating my dessert I placed it to the left of the cash register which I was told was fine so they could take it away.

This place is easy to miss while you are driving down Butler St but again the place fills up very quickly since it is a popular place for sandwiches and French pastries.

I did ask if they were planning to add any other locations at the moment and was told they aren't. Either way if you visit this location or the one in Mt. Lebanon you will get exceptional service and some of the best Parisian desserts you can imagine."}
{"text":"Review number 136 of this quaint little bakery is going to be short and sweet (no pun intended) and to the point. I loved the place. Like a little piece of Paris right on Butler Street. 

The pastry looked amazing but I wasn't there for the buttery, flakey croissants, the eclairs, or other delectable treats. I wanted a loaf of crusty, airy spelt flour bread. I wasn't disappointed. Besides all the treats you'd be served at a French cafe, they also serve up some pretty mellow and smooth coffee. My only beef, just like any business on Butler Street, the parking is ridiculous."}
{"text":"Decadence defined here. La Gourmandine has mastered the art of baking perfection!  

Every.  Single.  Item.  Is.  Amazing.

This place is a MUST-TRY when in Pittsburgh.  

The only caveat is you could literally eat everything here... and come back for seconds.  And if you do, well, that would be most definitely bust your diet.  And probably your belt!

La Gourmandine, if only you were located in Nashville..."}
{"text":"This place is one of those rare establishments where you can 'just go there and get what looks good', and it will be good.  Once when my brother was visiting town, and we showed up later in the day because of that (all the pretty and flashy stuff sells earlier, as it should, because it's all really good), what was left was not visually too impressive...  looked like bread, other types of bread, and some different bread.  However, I ended up selecting some bread-looking thing with marzipan filling, and my brother got some other bread-looking thing with a different twist, and both were really great.  I hate to use the word 'amazing', but here it fits.  I said, \"Wow\" out loud when I tried it.  Then I stared at it to try to remember what it looked like, and hoped it would remain a secret so that there would always be one or two when I came late.

I've had a variety of items from this bakery, and have never been disappointed.  I have been surprised, and always in a positive way - how many places or things can you say that about?  It's just a great bakery.  I highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"I live dangerously close to La Gourmadine, and I'll admit it takes quite a bit of self-control to reserve this as an occasional treat. It's a tiny little place, but the number of items offered never ceases to surprise me. They have a huge variety of breads, pastries, and some savory items like sandwiches and quiche. On a weekend morning you can expect a line, but it moves quickly and you'll be outside enjoying your treats in no time at all.

Two of my favorite items:

The macarons aux framboises is essentially two giant macarons with fresh raspberries and a lychee cream in the center. The macarons are perfect, with that deliciously chewy outer shell and soft inside. The cream and strawberries make a wonderful combination, and overall it's a really refreshing treat. 

The marquise is an elongated bar covered in flawless chocolate and beautifully decorated with gold leaf and some other embellishments. Inside are layers of chocolate mousse, creme brulee, and a crispy caramel crust. The flavor combination is spot-on; it's not overly rich or heavy, but just right.

If you're in the area, I definitely recommend stopping in. You will not be disappointed!"}
{"text":"Didn't make it around the menu yet but from the taste of the two pastries I had they deserve every star available.  Choux la creme and pear tart, unbelievable pastry. Quality is very similar to Tartine in San Francisco (minus the cakes) and I'll add to this review once I try the quiche and sandwiches.  Once you've eaten around enough in your life you get an idea that this is one of those, \"You can't go wrong with anything you order.\""}
{"text":"La Gourmandine deserves the 5 star reviews.  It's a spot-on French bakery.  I've been here a few times now, and last week I stopped in for a sandwich.  It's just like I got in Paris...a small loaf of crusty, chewy bread, meat, cheese, mayo, lettuce.  Sounds simple right?  It is, and that's what makes it so awesome.  

The inner fat in me wants one of everything in that sexy glass display case (at once) but I'm attempting to pace myself.  So far I've had the lemon tart, and last time I had this flaky, donut-like pistachio creme thing.  Holy crap, I'm pretty sure it's made by magical leprechauns.  You would expect it to be overly sweet, but it's this perfectly-balanced delicous little crack-stick.  

When I was getting ready to leave, they brought out a new cake that was covered in large chocolate shavings.  Even if that damn thing is $50, I'm buying it for my next party.  A lot of their goods in the display case looks like art.  Edible, delicious, art."}
{"text":"The best bakery in Pittsburgh. I dream about this place. Vanilla Religiouse is one of the best pastry items I've ever tasted, but it hasn't been on the menu for quite some time. 

Must haves:
Almond Croissant
Baguettes 
Lemon tart
Chocolate Eclair
Brie or pizza tart
(You can't go wrong with any item actually).

Not much seating. La Prima coffee, but it's usually warm not hot. But who cares? You go here for the baked goods."}
{"text":"I've never had something that wasn't delicious from here, only different levels of deliciousness. My favorite is their La Gourmandise pastry filled with vanilla cream and chocolate chips. Their almond croissant and quiches are also amazing. Prices are very reasonable, around $2-3 for a pastry which is well worth the quality that you get. The staff is super friendly and very patient while you take your time choosing from all the goodies. Definitely recommend checking this place out!"}
{"text":"Hands down my favorite bakery in Pittsburgh. Because of this place, I start to look for French bakeries in many different cities. No where else is like La gourmandine. Every time I go home to visit my family, I always buy a bunch of their goodies to treat my family. They enjoy every single pastry I brought back. My personal favorite is their chocolate pastries, especially Marquis and chocolate eclair. Another one I really love is the lemon tart. Mmm also, their breads are so delicious too. I tried their sour dough, their French bread, and the croissants. Their Almond croissant is to die for btw. I also tried multiple large cakes, such as the chocolate moose cake, and the pistachio cake. They both are without a doubt delicious. I got so many things here and never once disappoint me. 
Now I think about it, I really like one of their mini puffy bread thingy. I don't remember the name, but there is sugar on top. They are very cute and make a good snack to share with friends. Anyway, if you haven't been here, please change that ;)"}
{"text":"My newest addiction! I'm embarrassed that it has taken me this long to get to La Gourmandine, but now that I've tried it, I am hooked. Just the fact that I'm writing this review as I am chowing down on a chocolate croissant should be enough proof. The shop itself is small and options are more limited than other bakeries, but I'm tellin' ya, you won't be disappointed in anything you decide to go with. Since it was my first visit, I decided to test the waters and get a little of everything since they all looked so darn pretty. This was probably a fantastic and dangerous idea because they were all incredible. Highly recommend the almond croissant which was my favorite! They're about $3-5 per item so it is a bit pricier but honestly, it's worth it, even for the biggest penny pincher like myself. There was a bit of a wait, but the line moves fast and the staff are so friendly and helpful (especially when you're uncultured and can't pronounce all the French names like me). This is a must-try for anyone with a sweet tooth!"}
{"text":"Living within walking distance is dangerous. Seriously it's so hard to stop myself once inside. Of course the French bread is to die for and the croissants are always flaky, light and pleasing. If I could, I'd eat the pastries for every meal!"}
{"text":"I have been to this bakery multiple times and each time I am impressed with the selection as well as the service. 

I arrived here about 15 minutes before opening on a Saturday and a line had already formed out the door.  

What we sampled: 
Pain au chocolat ou Chocolatine (outrageously delicious and flakey)
Brioche fine (sampled later in the day and was still as good as the things we tried for breakfast)
Croissant aux amandes (delicious almond croissant!)
Baguette traditionnelle (best baguette ever!)

I will definitely return, and even with the line once the doors opened I was out in about 3.5 minutes!"}
{"text":"The croissants are delicious. They remind me of being in Paris. They also have an item that looks like a candy bar and is the most delicious thing ever. It's messy to eat with a creamy, nutty middle. Its good! Be prepared for a 20 minute wait if you go around lunch time."}
{"text":"Some seriously high-quality desserts and baked goods here, but they go fast--I'd arrive early in the day, because if you come later on, there won't be much available."}
{"text":"This place. I can't even... It is just incredible. AND now a second location!!! The best french pastries I've ever had. Wait. The best pastries I've ever had! And the most artful too!

Walking in you're met with the most amazing smell you've ever experienced in your life. Then you gaze across the display of beautiful creations, you almost don't wait to eat them. But you do. And you enjoy them, immensely. There really isn't a pasty I've had that I didn't like. The almond croissants are my fave's, but I also enjoy their pistachio desserts and chocolate wafer-like desserts. Forgive me for not remembering their proper name. I think I was too busy shoving them in my mouth.

This location is a lot bigger than their orginal one, plus the free parking lot is a major perk compared to the Lawrenceville street parking. Plus, there's free wifi! I think it would be dangerous to sit here for a while..."}
{"text":"As a smart man once said: \"Once it hits your lips it tastes so good!\"

That sums up everything about La Gourmandine Bakery!  The delicacies in the case looked scrumptious, it's hard to choose one... so I choose two!  I bought the Délice de Pistache and Paris-Brest.  The Délice de Pistache is Choux dough covered with pistachio mousseline and topped with dark chocolate.  I had planned on only taking a bite.  That did not happen.  In fact, as soon as I took the first bite I was floating away towards the pearly gates of heaven!  It was just divine!  The Choux dough was light and almond tasting, the pistachio mousseline was fluffy and distinctly tasted of pistachio (I hate when fillings don't taste like what they should) and the chocolate just topped off my dessert decent!  

The Paris-Brest is Choux dough filled with hazelnut cream.  It actually looks almost like a doughnut.  It was the same heavenly taste!  They're actually very similar but different shapes.  The hazlenut again was distinct and the Choux dough was light with a slight crisp to it.  I would say my fave had to be the Délice de Pistache though.  But both were fantasmic!

I also grabbd a sandwich, which was very good as well... But I didn't want to mention that first because I was too excited about th desserts!  I had the Le Campagnard, which is a French baguette with mayonnaise, turkey, lettuce, tomatoes, and Swiss cheese.  The baguette was incredible, and I don't normally even like them.  Too hard to chew.  Even though it was a baguette, you could tell it was freshly baked that day, so it didn't have that stale taste a baguette from say, Panera, would have.  I'm glad they offer lunch, because it's a chance to grab a quick sammich and bring home dessert for later... or stuff your face with it then!"}
{"text":"Fancy?
Location'l another downtown area in Pitts?? I am not sure...
The shop is nice looking from outside and when I got there people were already in line for their fancy bakeries. 
And it is indeed good!
Had paris brest - surprising it is made of pistachio and peanut butter. I have never been a peanut butter fan but their paris brest made me want to indulge their peanut butter flavor.

And all the other stuff look very good. I love the texture of almond croissant and chocolate one is cripsy 

Service: 5$ min for credit card...

overall: good!I am glad that this place exists in Pitt"}
{"text":"Whether I'm getting this from the bakery or from 21st Street Coffee it always impresses me! 
Be prepared to wait in line in Lawrenceville, but it's 100% worth it!!!"}
{"text":"Stopped by here on my way home to Baltimore. It was mid-day and their display was already almost empty, which tells me 1. their items are fresh since they go through inventory a lot and 2. people love their food! I bought four different croissants (thankful for the recommendations the employee gave me) and traveled on my way. When I go home, my family and I sampled them and they were still fresh! They were all delicious and flaky and irresistible! I can't wait to go back on my next trip and try their other products!"}
{"text":"Wish I could say it was a nice experience but it was not. I walked in on a very slow day ,most days I walk past it's so busy I don't bother because I don't like to wait. I walk in the door and see a young girl behind the counter no more then 3 feet from me. She didn't lift her head to look at me to even make eye contact. I decided to just walk the 4 feet to the other person standing by the register and she smiled and assisted me . I could not help but notice the girl that ignored me still standing at the same spot when a girl very similar in look walked in . The girl that ignored me seemed to light up when the saw the girl walk in and jumped at the chance to offer assistance to her with a smile. Just a point of reference, I am a 64 year old white man and the girl behind the counter was in her 20s with tattoos and piercings. The girl that walked in after me was a girl in her 20s with tattoos and piercings. I have been in this earth more then both theses girls combined ages so I do know when I am being ignored. If you are incapable of dealing with all types of people you should not work in a retail outlet. Leave your hang ups at home or better yet just stay home."}
{"text":"An extraordinary little way to treat yourself. Flavorful and satisfying treats bring me back to my childhood as a bakers family."}
{"text":"Marvelous French bakery in the heart of Lawrenceville. Everything is authentic and delicious. 

The lines are often quite long, especially on a Saturday morning, and sometimes they run out of the things I'm looking to buy.

The staff is friendly and helpful. Definitely a fun place to shop."}
{"text":"I will be a Pittsburgh unit in no time.  there isn't a dessert that I don't enjoy from this place.  I go get a different dessert every time."}
{"text":"Sacré bleu!  La Gourmandine is so amazing, I'm going to have to use some fancy French words to do it justice.

Who would have thought a bakery, much less a bakery in Central Larryville, may be one (if not THE) best in city?  I especially enjoy the Le Campagnard lunch special - 6 bucks and change for a delicious baguette with turkey and cheese, including a drink.  You can pay that amount and get bread baked in a toaster oven down the street at Jared's Sandwich Shop and wait in line for 25 min. to eat that delicacy, or pop on in to La Gourmandine for fresh French bread that will fill you up even better.

Ah, always the pièce de résistance of my La Gourmandine experiences, the Marquise.  I love Crème Brulee, and this delicious (and LARGE) pastry combines that with crispy caramel and dark chocolate mouse.  It melts in my mouth.  The ladies that work at LG make me giggle when they ask if I'd like it placed in a box for later....I'm lucky if it makes it till I get home! 

Speaking of the LG ladies, the staff there is very friendly, even when dealing with large crowds.  The busiest times seem to be weekend mornings.  I never have a wait when I stop by during weekday lunch hours.

A BIG merci beaucoup to La Gourmandine, a taste of Paris right here in our own Hipster Paradise."}
{"text":"This is the real deal. Go! The pastries are legit. And the bread delicious. I mean this place is like stepping into a neighborhood patisserie in France. I've tried the pain chocolate. The Bouche de Noel. And the country loaf bread. I will be coming back here every time I need bread and a French pastry!"}
{"text":"I love French pastries and I didn't expect to find one here. Not too sweet, light, and delicate.


Update 8/22/2015:

Came for the second time, and once again not disappointed! Actually, that's an understatement, since I simply love the pastries here. Although my love for macarons tempted me to get a lemon flavored one (just one!), I tried new desserts this time, including the flan. I do not regret finishing off every last crumb of it!
I also purchased a baguette, 2 croissants, and an almond croissant for our breakfast tomorrow morning. Because, come on, how can you resist those freshly baked bread??

But I must warn you: after coming here twice, I learned an important lesson. To be able to have the most options available, come early morning if possible. These breads/pastries sell out quick!

And I have to mention how lovely the staff are. They are always friendly and full of smiles. It makes this place even more irresistible. Oh La Gourmadine, please don't make me bankrupt on your goods (or fat). :P"}
{"text":"Very good and very friendly! One of the workers there was from France so we felt it was so authentic. I really enjoy the croissants for breakfast. Definitely will be back."}
{"text":"This is a gem in Pittsburgh. Its so awesome it has no equal. I feel guilty every time I go here that I don't frequent it more often. Seriously why don't I have their bread on hand at all times."}
{"text":"Best macaroon i have ever had.  Hands down.  Strawberry rhubarb was to die for.  I had to keep myself from crawling back for more."}
{"text":"The best french macaroons!
This is the go to place for french macaroons. A line out the door is common so order ahead and come early. Large selection of flavors. The large cream and raspberry ones are my favorite."}
{"text":"This place is absolutely, mind-blowing, unbelievable!  I lived for a brief stint in Paris (pah-ree), and this is as if a wonderful Paris boulangerie set it's digs in Pittsburgh.  It's spot on!  You must give this place a try, you won't be sorry.  I'm not lying when I say that I adore everything they offer, seriously it's all good, you can't go wrong. here.  DH ordered  me a specialty raspberry mousse cake for my birthday (isn't he the best, i just love him) it was to die for!!!  But my absolute favorite item on their menu is the pain au chocolate because it's how it should be, the perfect amount of chocolate (the fancy kind), and the buttery croissant crust.... oh yeah baby."}
{"text":"I am a weekly patron here at this point. Sometimes twice weekly! I started with the Lawrenceville location and absolutely loved it - when I found out there was one closer to me, I was very excited.

My typical weekly buy is the Macaron aux Fruits - a large macaron filled with lychee cream and raspberries. It is DIVINE! 

Other treats that I've tried:

Choux à la crème - this was great for a very light sweet treat. Airy pastry with a very light cream filling. 

Dèlice de pistache - I was very excited to try this one as I normally love pistachio anything. I was not a big fan of the choux dough combined with the pistachio cream, but the cream itself was lovely.

Choquettes - these little guys are great for small treats. Tasty dough that is similar to a donut and dusted with sugar, and you get a dozen for $3!

Vegetarian quiche - I'm not well versed in the world of quiches but I was not a big fan of this. I think goat cheese is probably a love it or hate it thing, and I was not a fan of this. Would still like to try the other quiche with the bacon though!

Marquis - Rich, chocolatey, and definitely indulgent!

Mouelleux au chocolat - Very rich and very delicious! Kind of like a chocolate lava cake but far better than anything you'd get at Applebee's. 

Fraisiers - delightful little sponge cakes, perfect for a sweet snack

Small macarons - So far, I've been 50/50 with the ones I've tried. I like the pink and purple ones. 

Forget the name, but the pumpkin tart is easily the best tasting pumpkin dessert I've ever had. 

Additionally, I'm not sure where they get their coffee, but it's very good. It never tastes burnt and is always fresh, and the flavor is wonderful."}
{"text":"I had been wanting to visit this place since moving to Pittsburgh but am rarely in Lawrenceville. When on a thrifting trip with a friend who lives in the area, she suggested we make a stop there. I was really excited to try it out based on reviews and photos. 

As soon as you walk in it smells amazing. The staff are friendly and the service is fast. I ordered a tartelette aux framboises and was not disapppinted. The crust was delicious and perfectly baked. The raspberry filling and vanilla cream topping were perfect. I had a bite of my friend's macaron aux framboises as well and almost wished I had grabbed one of those, as even though my own treat was amazing, I enjoyed hers even more. 

Next time I am DEFINITELY trying out the delice de pistache!"}
{"text":"I came home sick from a vacation, and all I immediately wanted were these pastries.  Abricotine is fantastic in the morning with coffee, the pan aux chocolat is to die for heated up with all that melting chocolate, there's an apple pastry that is like the abricotine that I can't remember the name of, but is equally delicious, and finally, the choux a la creme -- oh my god.  You'll never leave disappointed.  Everything is fresh, and mouth watering.  I had to stop myself from going in AGAIN today..."}
{"text":"One of my favorite places! I do not go as often as I should... which is probably a good thing, because every time I am there I want everything they have. It's not a big place at all, and not somewhere I would go to sit down and enjoy my pastries, but somewhere I would pick something up to eat as I'm walking to my car because I can't wait to try it. 

One of my favorite things to get is the quiche. I like just about every kind they make! There is just something about it that I look forward to so much. Another thing I love (which I don't know the cool french name for) is a pastry with chocolate chips and some sort of vanilla custard-y filling. It's just. so. good. 

My most recent experience was on the day before Thanksgiving when just about everyone is picking up desserts and pies. I expected to walk in and it be stressful and overwhelming, but it was in fact the best way to start my day. The employees were buzzing around behind the counters like busy bees, helping each person with a warm smile on their faces. They also kept bringing out small trays of samples and putting them on the top of the counter so everyone in line could try different things. I had about 5 or 6 different items just while waiting to pay. It's as if they just knew the way to my heart... free samples of delicious food. 

I've had breads, pies, cakes, pastries, quiche, coffee and it's all been wonderful and I'd say very reasonably priced. I would highly recommend this place for delicious, high quality, and unique items!"}
{"text":"Stopped in the bakery today around 9:30 am. Did not have to wait. Couple siting outside the bakery having some pastries and coffee. Went inside the bakery and was greeted by a friendly staff member. There were a variety of goodies that I could not pronounce, but the lady explained each item I pointed at. Before I knew it, I had a box of bake items to take home at a reasonable price. There isn't any seating inside. There is a noticed posted on the wall explaining why they don't have seating and apologizing. Seems that if the bakery had seating, it would be considered a restaurant. As its a bakery, therefore no seating. There wouldn't be much room for seating if it was offered. The items I bought and tasted were delicious. Its a nice little place."}
{"text":"I go there regularly...always delicious and fresh.... One place in town that isn't over hyped."}
{"text":"Put in in my mouth. 
Put in in your mouth. 
I said my big hungry mouth.
I said your big hungry mouth. 
I just want to eat them all. 
You will want to eat them all. 
Cause all of those croissants just melt. 
As soon as they hit your mouth. 

You won't just need one. 
You are going to need two. 
Or three, or four. Then you'll be coming back for some more. 

This place is so good, stop wasting time reading Yelp reviews and go get in line. Buy everything you can get your hands on today.  This is where real craft and talent shine. And your personal preference is all up to your mouth & belly. Let your taste buds guide you. Just don''t make the mistake of not getting enough!  Strategize when you order. Things sell out quickly and you WILL get home and vividly fantasize about what had been in your mouth earlier in the day. Just order everything at once. What you will be shoving in your face right now. What you will be shoving in your face later. Possibly what you will want to be shoving in your face really, really later.  

Trust me on this one."}
