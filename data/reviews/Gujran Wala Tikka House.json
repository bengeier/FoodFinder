{"text":"I started coming here the very next day it opened as I'm a food enthusiast and will try almost anything that's new. My first impression about Tikka House was enough for me to come back here every time I felt a craving for Indian/Pakistani cuisine. The food is always fresh, made from scratch and the taste never forgets to delight me. When friends and family are over I always order from Tikka House and they always appreciate and enjoy the food cos most of the indian/pakistani food they ever ate from other Gerrard Street restaurants didn't seem to be good enough. 
I'm glad this place is opened close to my home, now I dont need to run all over toronto to look for indian food. I totally recommend it to people and their Chicken Cheese Kebab and Haleem are pure awesome."}
{"text":"Excellent food& service. Lamb Karahi, butter chicken, she warmas were all flavorful. Went with family will definitely go again..."}
{"text":"amazing food amazing service! their bbq is probably the best in town! Highly recommend the seekh kabab and lambchops."}
{"text":"Really delicious Pakistani food. I have lived in the area five years and have tried most of the restaurants. What separates this place in my opinion is that it is fresh and non-oily. The palak paneer is truly stupendous. And as the other reviews have said, very friendly owners."}
{"text":"Great food great service no other place like this at Gerrard st.pure pakistani taste."}
{"text":"Best Indian food in town, the nahari another kebabs, amd the briyani are things you'll never forget. 
Everything is made to order. You can see them make the food infront of you. Friendly owners and really good food, I can't ask for more than that :)"}
{"text":"Got take-out: Chicken Biriyani, Garlic Naan, Beef Nihari.  Eating the first two now.  Impressed.  Nihari is rare."}
{"text":"Though I'm pretty happy that the restaurant closes pretty late (we wanted to pick up food at midnight) - I'm a little less impressed compared with all these reviews. No, I don't think it's the best Pakistani place on the strip - I think it's average. We just had the butter naan and the mixed bbq plate.

I had been CRAVING Lahore Tikka House afghani chicken and naan, so thought we could satisfy it. But it didn't. The tikka chicken was super awesome, the kababs were great as any other place, the afghan chicken didn't have much flavour and they didn't even give us any beef boti (though it is supposed to be part of the order - so that kinda sucked). I would have given this restaurant a 3 star other wise - but missing an entire component of a platter with zero explanation isn't fair in my books. I probably wouldn't have gotten the platter otherwise, because for $20 fit wasn't really worth it. 

The naan was ok too, fluffy and light. 

Other than that, maybe the cooks should wear their hair up if not in a hair net. It sorta made me feel weird to see the woman on the grill with her hair long and just worn out with a clip. Erm... :( - hair tie next maybe?"}
{"text":"Great Pakistani food with great service!  The lamb karahi with butter naan was amazing!! Food was made fresh and good quality. Would definitely come back!"}
{"text":"Went for a late supper with a couple of family members on a friday. The restaurant was empty ...hesitated for a moment seeing that they had no other customers at the time. Given that the only other option was Lahore tikka (which has okay food but terrible service) - decided to give it a try.

The owner was very polite and she had some great recommendations. The menu itself is short but has all the essentials. Food was cooked up fresh and served in about 15-20 minutes. The waiter also promptly took drink orders and refilled waters during this time.

We ordered a fresh ontario lamb curry and a chicken curry, as well as some bbq items. Everything was delicious. The food had lots of flavour and the spices weren't overwhelming. The naan bread was among the best I've had - soft, chewy and melt in your mouth good, and the lamb curry was perfect (no smell). Best of all, the food wasn't overly greasy and oily - the kind that makes you feel sick after.

Only recommendation for owners: the lamb had mostly bone and not much meat. Even though it was tender and flavourful, it may be short on quantity for customers looking to order \"family style\" to share.

In short - would I recommend this? Yes. And over most of the options on gerrard."}
{"text":"Great place... An easily missed gem on Gerrard east that we loved on a Friday night. 

Similar to another review it was pretty quiet inside so we were hesitant but loved this place - very tasty dishes and much less oil than Lahore Tikka House for example.  

We ordered the butter chicken, lamb garhai (gosht) a garlic and sesame naan, their special 3-kebab chicken wrap (in naan), and an extra 4 kebabs. 

Loved everything really especially the curries. 

Only disappointing item was a masala chai at the end of the meal but they took it off the bill right away. 

We'd come back here for sure."}
{"text":"Amazing nihari, lamb chops

Naan is good, samosas are very tasty 

Chicken kabobs are nice too 

Can't go wrong with anything here

It's a little pricey and the service is a little slow, but it's totally worth it"}
