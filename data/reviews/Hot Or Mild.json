{"text":"The chicken biryani and samosa are the only things that taste good...rest of it is really bad!"}
{"text":"I've been here about 5 times over the past 3 months. The food is delicious but the service is HORRIBLE! I keep waiting for it to get better, but am only disappointed each trip. The food is worth the poor service, I suppose, otherwise I wouldn't keep coming back!  2016/10/06: Revised rating to 1-star.  Now they seem to open only when they feel like it. In the past couple months, I went there for lunch several times around Noon. Twice, the doors were locked and no one was around. Another time, I arrived and there were several employees (owners?) waiting outside the door. The lady said they were \"waiting to be let in\" (whatever that means).  I've since stopped going here altogether.  There's too many other restaurants with decent service to choose from in the area for me to continue wasting my time  and money on this place!"}
{"text":"In looking thru all the reviews, no one mentioned the conditions of the restrooms!!! They were deplorable! No toilet paper or soap to wash your hands!!!! Sign big as day telling employees to wash their hands.....eekkkk!!! I am hoping that i will not get sick from eating the food which was mediocre at best. Had i used the restroom before ordering, I would have been high tailing my ass out of there!! Hmm....wonder when was their last health inspection!?!"}
{"text":"Well, let's make this as simple as it can get ! The food is fresh and outstanding.  My family has had much Indian Food at friends home and YES we do cook our own Indian Food if we have enough time, yet you just can't just make your own Naan.  To make the next step about the truth and efforts. People DO care and do their best to accommodate your requests and this is not a fast food restaurant or some drive trough joint you can just be in a hurry to get your food and move on.  Like said before, Indian Food is prepared different and fresh, not just cut and paste and microwaved.  So for all the self opinionated YELPER's out there that tend to ruin some other business because they do not care about what they write, it is important to preserve other peoples live and their source of income.  Unless you have given a place more than 2 times a try, you will never know the true value of the place.  In other ways, do you ditch ever date after the first time ?  Now, this is to the owner ;  Suri,  You have been doing an outstanding job and we have never been disappointed by the food or service.  Advice to people who never had Indian Food ; Look, ask, sample, taste, don't be afraid to explore. My wife never liked Indian Food ever. Yet, I made her finally venture and explore.  Now she wont pick a Steak over Indian !!!  Namaste my friends.  Stefan"}
{"text":"Ordered goat Briyani and chicken 65. The quantity was good. Briyani rice is either low grade basmati or normal rice(not sure). Taste is very similar to local Briyani shops in India, and found some lumps of white rice too:(. Chicken 65 was on par , but tasted a little bitterness(not sure if its because of oil used), other than that 65 was good.  UPDATE 10/26/14 - The food has improved a lot.. Chicken DUM briyani is little greasy but its good...Currently i visit here once a week...."}
{"text":"First time to visit HotRmild.  I'm not a frequent eater of Indian cuisine, but I was very satisfied with what I ate.  I was able to pick two of four choices of vegetarian curry dishes.  I chose one mild and one medium.  They were amply spiced, with a pleasant burn simmering in my mouth after the meal.  The dishes were delicious, and there was plenty of it with a complement of rice, salad, and flatbread.  All for $6.99.  (Actually, as a Yelper, I received a $25 gift certificate. So I still have some credit left for more meals.). I will be back!"}
{"text":"Highly Recommend.  2nd visit and could not be happier.   We've tried a dozen selections (Chicken Curry, Goat Curry, Lamb Saag, Dal Tadka, Naan, Zeera Aloo, Palak Paneer (LOVE) ++++). The cheese in the Palak Paneer was so fresh and the goat in the curry divine.  They were all delicious, nicely seasoned, ready when I arrived at the time I was told to arrive!  This is definitely on our \"continue to visit weekly / bi-weekly for carryout\".   Also, very reasonable prices - for 3 of us ordering 6+ selections with many leftovers we spent $30. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"I cannot believe that the owner suggested I have more \"patience.\" I had waited over an hour for my food when I decided to leave. And no, I did not leave after the food was prepared. I left after I was told it was going to be an additional 10 minutes, which would have put my wait time to a whopping 70 minutes! A good restaurant has consistent recipes with consistent product and there should be no \"quality check\". You follow the recipe, you make the food, done. At least I wasn't alone on this one - when I left, the waiting room was full of people who had waited long before the expected wait time. In the future, this restaurant needs to have back-up employees to serve the customers needs or the door should temporarily close.   Really...\"patience\"?!"}
{"text":"I ordered takeout from their website at hotrmild.com. This is definitely the way \"to go\" (get it? - Dad joke). It's one of the best restaurant websites I've seen - photos of almost every dish along with great descriptions. The best part is you can click on whatever you want and pay online. For everyone griping about how long it takes, they give you an exact estimate of how long it will take to make your order and then even send a text to your phone to confirm that the order was received. The estimate was correct and my order was ready when I arrived - in and out in one minute, plus the two guys working the counter were super friendly and the meal was well-packed (crucial for those of us Indian food takeout lovers who have arrived home only to find Floormat Vindaloo after a leaky container spills). The portions are a bit smaller than the restaurants that charge $10.99 per dish but I still think they give you more for your money - and the dishes are so inexpensive it allows you to order several different dishes for the same price and set up your own buffet once you get home."}
{"text":"Hot or Mild is just bad. From the lack of ability to cook, to the ridiculously small food portions, to the long waits this joint will not last much longer.  The owner always seems to come up with excuses for the problems, as can be seen by his responses to negative reviewers here on Yelp. This is so unprofessional. Rather than taking ownership of the legitimate complaints, he makes excuses.   I ordered chicken Tandoori. There was a black hair in the rice. The chicken was also undercooked. It was actually pink and raw in some places.  I ate some of the raw chicken before I realized it was undercooked! I almost threw up. It was so disgusting. You can die from eating undercooked chicken. It is nothing to mess with. I recently read an article about how 90 some percent of chicken is contaminated with at least 1 incurable super-bug and this is why it is essential that it be cooked properly. I saved the uncooked chicken for a couple days, so that if I died my husband could have it tested and sue.  One of the pieces of chicken was also missing a huge chunk of meat - as if someone took a large bite out of it! My husband ordered the Butter Chicken.  I kid you not, there were 5 tiny pieces of chicken in it! It was the biggest rip-off ever!   If you value your life, my advice is to stay away from this place."}
{"text":"It's gone down hill over the past year. I no longer go out of my way to pick up food from here."}
{"text":"It's a good place to have authentic indian food, service is good. I recommend chicken wraps and sweet. Service credits to abhi and akhi......."}
{"text":"Best Indian food in Cleveland. Prices are very reasonable too. The chicken tikka J masala is amazing."}
{"text":"Great food!!!  Total bummer you can't eat it there, although my sister and I pigged out on their couch.  Really delicious food!  Only take out tho"}
{"text":"I understand that this place just opened, but they have a long way to go make it a viable business. First, they are very disorganized. I arrived at 11:35, five minutes after their opening, and very little food was prepared for their hot choices. Instead, I ordered from the menu, and was told that it take 15 minutes. It actually took 30 minutes. Although the dishes I ordered were all flavorful, there were several problems. The samosas were ice cold, not even lukewarm. The naan did not seem to be homemade and was of fair quality.  The nutter chicken and chana masala were both very tasty, and the portions were of good size for the price. The young men who worked there were casually attired and could have been more professional.  I suppose I will try the place again, but if you are interested I suggest stopping by to pick up a menu and then phone in your order another day to avoid the wait. The owners could have a successful venture if they improve the appearance, service, and quality control."}
{"text":"Not bad at all, only problem is the place is colder than a son of a bitch and not really set up for dining. Also I was given the wrong change and it actually worked out in my favor and I ended up making a dollar on the deal, plus the food. Can't beat that"}
{"text":"My son & I found this one day & have been back many times since.  I've never been to India before, but I'm guessing this is as authentic as it gets.  We've tried just about everything on the menu and haven't had anything we didn't like.  My son really likes the Chicken 65 & if you like spicy, you should give it a try."}
{"text":"Not the best Indian food I've ever had but online ordering and fairly quick pick up is convenient. Samosas were good (not too spicy), the paneer was okay, but a little overcooked. The garlic naan was delish!! (but unfortunately comes as a verrry small order). Over all, I would try it again, but not sure it's anything super speical...especially since Taste of Kerala is right down the road."}
{"text":"Don't care for it.  There were 4 of us - we had takeout. Between the 4 we had 3 different curries and their Samosa. One of the curry was literally a bag of frozen veggies simmered in a curry sauce.  Tasted horrible. The other two curries are supposed to be different - paneer makhni (pre made and on the warmer) and baingan bartha (made to order eggplant).  They both tasted pretty much the same.  They asked me mild or hot for the made to order dish and I said hot.  I dint know that they would dump the bag of red chilli powder in my dish.  It was inedible. All 4 of us tried and could not go for a second bite.  All of us grew up in india and all of us eat spicy food.  But this thing was insane.  Unfortunately it had to go to the dumpster. The paneer dish was OK.   Naan was lumpy at the edges - typical of the unskilled chef. Place is pretty new but typical look.  TV playing Indian songs in the corner.  Unwelcoming hosts managing the counter and going in and out of the kitchen too.  Oh well.  Seems like yet another part time owner trying to sell Indian food with ad hoc employees and chef."}
{"text":"My first time here. I had the lamb Saag and garlic naan both of which were ok.  The atmosphere is definitely authentic.  Essentially no place to sit very slow definitely third world.  Too bad it's in mayfield.   If you really want Indian cuisine take out and have 2 hours to kill this is the place for u otherwise go elsewhere."}
{"text":"So I used to be a big fan, but they have gone all 'let's not give much'.  21 dollars for 4 pieces of chicken swimming in butter sauce and 4 pieces swimming in curry.  4 samosa and a piece of nana bread.  So still great flavor, give them that, but not very satisfying."}
{"text":"Everything was not fresh, cooked from frozen,  even the naan.  I would recommend indian puri lunch buffet in chesterland."}
{"text":"This place was really good, and REALLY cheap. I did a double take when I saw the prices. I also love that they have Indo-Chinese food (gobi manchurian, chili paneer). The pakoras were solid and the garlic naan is some of the best I've had in the area. The samosas were also tasty. Definitely worth our while to stop in and grab some food on the way home from work."}
{"text":"Decor - A small fast food joint for indian food. Unfortunately the facilities here are sub-par and should mainly be utilized for take out. They had 2 small tables and a large sofa area, but neither were cleaned properly. Their bathroom, located down a narrow corridor, was quite messy.  Service - The server/cook was very courteous and understanding of our waffling party members. Also the reason for the extra star.  Food -  The pros: each order of rice is large, the naan was also large and hot. My party mentioned that the samosas were piping hot and the best part of the meal.  The cons: chili paneer (too spicy and didn't have any indian flavors to it), paneer makhani (tasted like it had too much butter and very little heat), bhel puri (it was mainly puffed rice with sauces, rather than the usual ingredients), the flavors were very underwhelming.   Overall - Subpar food and facilities. If I return to eat here again, it'll only be for a samosa."}
{"text":"It's a hidden oasis of wonderful flavors  and reasonable prices. I have never been disappointed by their food. By far the best Indian food in town"}
{"text":"I saw the review in Scene magazine, so I figured I would check it out. The wait time is definitely a problem. I waited a good 20 minutes for my food and the lady in front of me gave up on waiting for her naan. This seems like something they could easily fix with they worked with people that actually work in restaurants. The chairs and couch to wait on are not comfy and the TV was broken. Ended up walking around the grocery store next store and then playing games on my phone.   As for the food, it was meh. My mild butter chicken was at the edge of my heat tolerance and the complexity of flavor wasn't there. My husband's tikkah masala had a ton of bell peppers in it and only had 5 pieces of chicken. 5! The naan was yummy at least.  For $16 it wasn't horrible, but I am going to give them some time to get their shit together before I order again."}
{"text":"By far the best Indian food I have eaten in Cleveland so far. The flavors are so well developed and the dishes are truly delicious. The pricing is so reasonable too. Have recommended without reservation to any Indian native coming in town (who all vouch for its authenticity), or anyone for that matter! If you can't handle hear, be sure to request it be made mild. Most dishes are quite spicy. Have loved everything we've ordered from here: chicken biryani, lamb korma, chicken vindaloo, chicken 65, samosas, samosa chat, etc."}
{"text":"Definitely a place I would recommend for take out. Incredibly reasonable prices, good selection, daily specials and super tasty curries!  Actually everything we ordered was tasty.   Samosas (and the sauces were yummy).  Chicken makhani with rice or \"butter chicken\" more recognized by folks was DELICIOUS and all white meat (huge plus PLUS plus with the hubbers!).  The garlic naan moist, tasty and so fresh!  The kheer was just ok - big orders (which I didn't know so I ordered two but not the best flavor I have had and sort of clumping together like the rice wasn't all the way done or maybe over done?)  Recommend again for take out - not a bad wait time 25 mins - and worth it as for two we paid what would cost for one at a sit down establishment for about the same thing."}
{"text":"We heard about hot or mild from a friend and decided to try it out! My husband has been getting take out from them at lunchtime during the workweek. It's takeout only.  I tried it for the first time yesterday (husband went to go pick up so I have no idea what the service is like.) He got the chicken masala and I got the goat curry. We both shared naan and the takeout came with a huge batch of rice.  We are really impressed with the quality of food for the price. It's much cheaper than indian sit down restaurants and overall very good. We really liked the flavor of the goat curry and they gave a pretty decent amount of meat for $6.99. He tried the chicken masala for the first time - not his favorite, but he said that the other dishes he's gotten before have been good. The naan was really good. We had enough for leftovers.  We would definitely come back again for indian take out!"}
{"text":"Hot or Mild has been a part of our rotation for the last year or so. I have recommended this place to so many people. It is super convenient to order, pay online and then pick up on your way home from work.   We typically always order naan, samosas, and then two of the following with rice: chicken 65 (spicy), gobe manchurian (spicy cauliflower), baingan bharta (mashed eggplant). We like spicy and these dishes used to hit the mark!    The last two times we ordered, the eggplant was not flavorful or they were out, after we had ordered online. The cauliflower was not spicy/as flavorful and tonight it was burnt, resulting in bad flavor and texture. The naan was also burnt and not as flavorful. It's been very disappointing and I write in hopes that they can fix whatever is going on. I really miss it!"}
{"text":"Yes, It's a great place for people who like Indian food in Cleveland. I guess I Went there around 2 to 3 times in the last two months and had awesome food every time. Overall, tasty food and friendly staff.  Hope they will start dine-in section soon :)"}
{"text":"Best naan I ever had. My main complaint is that EVERYTHING is spicy!!! Even the samosas. I love Indian food but can't tolerate spicy. I uses to go a lot until they started making everything spicy. I complained one time about how they told me a dish was not spicy and it was, they were nice and said sorry, but never offered to replace my order, so I've kinda stopped going because I can't keep paying for dishes that are too spicy for me. Too bad."}
{"text":"Ok so I have worked in the local area that this Indian restaurant is located in for over a year. I kind of always wanted to try it but have NEVER had Indian food before. On Monday 12/1/2014 I decided to give it a try with some carry out.You can order and eat on the couch and watch tv I suppose but I wanted to get home. I ordered a few things to try a little bit of the menu. I went with Chicken 65 which was very good. If you like spicy this if great nicely spiced but I had a hard time eating it all as it became to much so I have some for tomorrow to eat :).  I also ordered the Chicken tikka masala. Nice big chunks of chicken and a sort of creamy spicy tomato curry sauce. This dish was by far the best thing I ordered. Mix it up with some good basmati rice they gave me and put it on the fresh tandoori naan bread I was in heaven. I also Ordered something called Gulab jamun. To me it was like a doughnut hole then soaked in this simple syrup so it became spongy and every time you took a bite the syrup dripped from the bread. It was good but I paid $2.99 and only received 3 of them. I won't by those again I thought you did not get enough of them. But as far as the portion of food you got a lot. All of this came to $19 and some change. I do suggest calling your order in ahead so they have time to prepare your food. I gave them about a 45min window and when I arived to pick my food up the gentlemen had it all ready bagged it up and I was on my way home. I give this place 4 stars right now. I can see it getting changed to 5 once I make my way through the menu"}
{"text":"Yum! When we're in the area we always make a point of stopping here. The young man working last night was very nice, offered to let me try something before buying it. Some of the more affordable Indian food around. We got 2 big meals and amazing garlic naan for far under $20. Only thing was the room was cold so we ended up eating in the car, but I'd say it's more of a fast food place anyways."}
{"text":"Worst restaurant ever!!! Everything we ordered was stale. First, when the guy who worked at the restaurant brought our chicken tikka and chicken kabob, the inside of the pieces were cold, as if it had just come out of the refrigerator. When told, he was just adamant that it had just been made, on our insistence he agreed to remake it, but went in the kitchen and brought out the same food, the chicken was hard like rocks. The Naan was obviously reheated,  with rubbery feeling of bread that has been microwaved.   In addition, our Restaurant.com reward certificate was not accepted,  despite the fact that it was specifically for this restaurant.  The owner told us that they had requested the removal of the certificate, and that WE should have asked before ordering and that it was all our fault. Overall, the service and food was very poor"}
{"text":"My wife and I love this place! The butter chicken and chicken tikka masala are awesome! Portions are fair for the cheap prices that they have. A little disorganized at times but they do get your food to you but usually a little bit later than they say."}
{"text":"Hot Or Mild is the closest halal Indian place to where I live (a minute or two from Coppertree Apartments), so I've been here fairly often. The food isn't amazing but it is pretty good. Personally I like their chicken dishes more than their vegetarian ones. The prices are pretty reasonable and you can get two or three servings per order. It also doesn't take too long to get the food (especially if it is already on display). I will continue ordering from here as long as I am in Cleveland."}
{"text":"Biryani used to be good...not anymore. It's like you are playing treasure hunt in that biryani by removing all that masala and things to find chicken and rice."}
{"text":"Have been back 4 times now and the food is great. It helps to order over the phone prior to getting there. It usually takes 20-30 min for them to make the food fresh. The staff is polite and friendly and offer me free samples of dishes I haven't tried yet."}
{"text":"Tip: Go to hotrmild.com and order your food if you are not going to get the quick carry-out options (Customers Choice veg/non-veg). If you order food from their kitchen - for example, Goat Biryani - it will take a while to make! They do prepare their food fresh. Think sit-down restaurant style cooking but prepared in to-go only style due to limited space.  Hot or Mild is only a few minutes from my work and I absolutely love Indian food. Needless to say, I visit Hot or Mild quite often.  Simply put: Hot or Mild is my absolute favorite Indian food restaurant.  ... and here is why!  Food:     I am the type of person that samples a few menu items that I am familiar with before making a real decision on how I feel about their quality and taste. Unfortunately, because this is Indian food, I was unable to do that. You cant exactly get a burger and fries here. But, that's a good thing! You would be missing out on way too much if you could. My coworkers used to make Indian food and bring it in for lunch. Therefore, I would expect that whatever food they prepare is as close to 'authentic' as our grocery stores allow it to be. Hot or Mild is no different. I feel that their food is of equal quality or better than the food that my coworkers have cooked for me. I do NOT feel as though they skip out on certain ingredients to keep prices low.  I have had the privilege of enjoying many menu items at this restaurant.      - Chicken Tikka Masala: Classic taste. Great for someone new to Indian food!     - Chicken Vindaloo: You can taste the mix of spices very nicely in this one. A second favorite here.     - Chicken Curry     - Butter Chicken: Essentially a less spicy tikka masala. Still good but I prefer the Tikka Masala!     - Paneer Tikka Masala: Replace the Chicken in Chicken Tikka Masala with cheese.     - Vegetable Jalfrezi (Added 11/3/14): My absolute favorite vegetarian dish that I have tried here. The spices are nice, complex, and delicious. The heat was spot on.     - Dal Tadka (Added 11/3/14): My least favorite dish over all. The spices were nice but they texture and flavor were not expected. The heat seemed to be a lingering after-burn.     - Samosas: Always delicious.     - Chutneys (all 3): Delicious!     - Rice, of course     - Salad     - Chapati      Next time I go I will be sure to get something that I have not had. This time around was Chicken Vindaloo - I might actually get this as an entree rather than in the Customers Choice combo box. It was really delicious! I also need to try some of their dessert options. Unfortunately, I have not tried any so I cannot comment on them. One other thing I feel necessary to add is consistency! Every single time, not just most of the time, that I have ordered from Hot or Mild my food has been pretty much the same quality as the food that I have ordered in the past!      Everything that I have tried has lots of flavor and leaves me happy and full! :)  Drink:     The only drinks that I have purchased from Hot or Mild are the pre-bottled soda type (coca-cola, pepsi, etc). Their prices are average for a restaurant that offers bottled soda and they keep them at a good temperature; Cold.  Customer Service:     I have been to Hot or Mild 20+ times and have had the opportunity to speak with the owner about his restaurant, food, etc. He is a nice Indian man who is trying to provide delicious, quality, indian food to the area. The guys who man the front counter are always helpful and when asked will help you in trying to decide. Just today I asked about Chicken Vindaloo versus Chicken Curry to see which had more spice. The chicken Vindaloo was definitely spicier than the Chicken Curry that I have ordered in the past.  Other Thoughts:     I need to start asking for my food to be spicier. Most people are likely good with the food exactly as it comes. Some items are spicier than others simply because of the types of spices being used in them. When ordering, make sure you specify your own level of spice or it will come the default 'mild' that is prepared to appeal to a greater audience.      I in no way want to bash Hot or Mild so please do not take it that way but keep in mind that the food and quality are appropriate for their prices. Some people, myself included, will feel that their food can rival other indian restaurants charging $12 for the same thing that you can get for $7 here. I have ordered take out from at least one other Indian restaurant in the area and it was far more expensive. You could easily feed two mouths with the same money you feed one elsewhere.      I cannot stress enough how important it is to order your food online, or by phone. This is kind of like ordering a pizza - you don't go to the store and sit and wait for them to make it. Even when I make indian food at home, from a jar, it takes me 30+ minutes and all I have to do is brown some chicken and then let it simmer in sauce.      A friend of mine said their garlic naan is fantastic. I really want to try."}
{"text":"It's so affordable. $18 will feed me for at least 2 (sometimes up to 3) meals! I will usually call ahead to order naan and then come to pick up from premade dishes. Not always super spicy, so I tend to add my own hot sauce at home."}
{"text":"The food tasted really good. Our order was prepared correctly and on time. After a previous experience of ordering and having to wait for a very long time, I decided to give it another try, but just order in advance. I had no issues. The staff is very friendly and they give nice portion sizes. My only complaint is that my naan was a bit on the burned side, and I had to peel off the burnt pieces. I just won't order that next time, but everything else was very tasty. I will be back. Great prices for quality Indian food."}
{"text":"My wife & I eagerly awaited the opening of this Indian restaurant. We are vegetarians and eat Indian food on a regulars basis. We also cook Indian food nearly every day at home.  We LOVE this restaurant. We typically order the vegetarian platter and the dishes are delicious. We especially enjoy the Paneer dishes and the Vegetable Jalfrezi. The Samosas are also delicious.  I highly recommend this restaurant."}
{"text":"Took forever to get my order . I was told 5 minutes took 25 and they wouldn't give my money back. Only order samosa and bread !!!"}
{"text":"After visiting this place twice for take-out, I feel comfortable giving them a 3.5 or 4.  The food is very good, especially for the price.  We like their garlic naan more than the (far more expensive) Saffron Patch.    On the first visit, I had the butter chicken, my wife had the chicken tikka masala.  I loved the butter chicken.  The tikka masala was a bit hot for my wife - we will do mild or occasionally medium at Saffron Patch, and she could eat the tikka masala but it was much hotter than we expected.  (We weren't asked nor did we specify any spice level.)  She also has a dislike of green pepper and we weren't aware that tikka masala would have that ingredient, but that's our own fault for not asking when ordering.  The order was prepared quickly - I called in and was told about 20 minutes, I took a bit longer than that and it was waiting for me when I arrived.  For the second visit (tonight), I ordered via their website rather than phone.  Their site is misleading, as it quotes \"45 minutes\" for all items, but this doesn't seem to be accurate.  They sent me what seemed to be an automated text message letting me know when they started preparing my order, I again arrived around 20-30 minutes after that and the order was *mostly* ready.  This time the rice hadn't been boxed up yet, and it took quite a while for the guy behind the counter to get that done, I\"m not really sure why.  He was polite and apologetic, but it's not like they had a line out the door or anything.  For the second order, we did butter chicken again, along with the nilgiri chicken korma and the malai kofta.  My wife really enjoyed the malai kofta, although she only had maybe 3-4 \"dumplings\" at most.  Both times, my butter chicken had around 6-8 pieces in it, and I believe the nilgiri korma was the same.  The korma was pretty good as well, but I still prefer the butter chicken, which is pretty similar to Saffron Patch's \"chicken banjaran.\"  My biggest complaint so far is that portioning is pretty inconsistent.  Meat amount varies a bit, and the amount of rice you get seems to vary based upon who packed it.  I don't mind having too much rice; the first order we ordered both dishes with rice and received a large square to-go container that was maybe 2/3 full of rice.  It was sufficient, but barely.  With the second order, we had rice on all 3 dishes.  I was expecting a large box and a small box of rice, which we received... but the large box was filled to the brim.  I didn't mind the bonus rice at all, but the lack of consistency between orders can be a problem for people trying to plan for more than just two diners, as one example.  We'll definitely be back, there are other items on the menu I'd still like to try.  We haven't had any of the major timing issues that people have complained about, hopefully we never do."}
{"text":"Bizarre experience. Owner seemed nice enough, but the whole experience was very strange. It was freezing in the restaurant, no music so it was super quiet and I think they only had 3 tables, but for some reason had two couches.  We told the guy we were going to eat there, but they still packed our food in to-go containers, which spilled all over the place when we tried to open them. Had to ask for silverware and were given a fork and a spoon to eat butter chicken, which needed to be cut up. The food really wasn't anything special. The only reason my rating is 2 stars is because I have not yet gotten sick from eating this food (I'm an hour in at this point). I really hope it stays that way."}
{"text":"A very modest, unpretentious restaurant with OK food. Went there for lunch while visiting Hillcrest Hospital and ate from the pre-prepared \"pick two\" lunch choices. I'd describe the choices perhaps as mild or milder, there was nothing approaching spicy. The chicken tikka masala and vindaloo were both fairly tasty. They earned a third star with the naan, which was fresh, hot and well done. I'll forgive almost anything if the naan is good in an Indian restaurant!  It appears primarily to be a take-out place, the ambiance was pretty much nonexistent. The cook/cashier/server was friendly and prompt. I'd be interested in trying ordering off the menu with a request for spice to see what they can do."}
{"text":"Some of the best Indian food around here. They adjust the spiciness to your preferences. Friendly service."}
{"text":"Food is delicious and they have a ton of vegetarian options, which can be made vegan if you call ahead. I've only been there once, but I plan to go again."}
{"text":"This is too good. The best price for what you have. For Indians you can increase your spice level upon request. I have stopped by two weeks ago and I visited it three times for now. Best Indian food one would get at an ease. I suggest this is to Americans who really are foodies, go for it! PALAK PANEER IS AT ITS BEST!"}
{"text":"If I could give Hot Or Mild 3.5 stars, I would. But I can't, so 3 stars it is.   The food was pretty yummy. I ordered the curry chicken, butter chicken - it came with jasmine rice and a little side salad. I also ordered naan because my life is incomplete without some naan in it. I will say that they can stand to give out a bit more meat. Or less rice.  I had an overabundance of rice. I will say that the meat was tender and properly seasoned.  Unfortunately, the wait is loooooooong. And while everyone was very friendly, they need to work on the promptness of service and hire more employees to handle the demand. The guy working the front was here, there and everywhere! They made my husband's food and said there was going to be a wait on the naan. Then the guy went into the back for a minute or two, then answered the phone and took an order, then checked some people out in the front... I was getting dizzy! By then, there were 3 people behind us. My husband thought it would be a good idea to walk to Starbucks and then come back. We did that and we waited another 5 minutes before they made my order. Then we waited another 5 minutes for our order of naan. We basically waited a good 30 minutes which for cafeteria style take out is a bit ridic.  I will be back because Indian food is delish and their food is pretty good at a somewhat reasonable price ($21 total). What I will do next time is ORDER AHEAD and then wait like 40 minutes before heading out! I will cut them some slack as they are new but I'm hoping they can work out the kinks."}
{"text":"I LOVE Indian food and, having moved just up the street, I was excited to try this place out. The reviews here had me nervous until I realized that all the negativity seemed to stem from impatience. I will happily wait for quality food cooked to order.   We ordered chicken curry, chicken 65, samosas, chicken tikka masala, chili bajji, palak paneer, chili (\"chilly\") chicken and pakora. All of that food was under $50! The takeout time is an automatic 45 minutes and my order was ready at the proper time. I was nervous that perhaps it may have been sitting there for a few minutes, but it was hot and fresh when I got it home!   The food was all AMAZING. Palak paneer is usually my favorite, but I thoroughly enjoyed each entree. My husband and 3 and 4 year olds felt the same way! We plan on ordering from here once a week.   This is amazing, authentic Indian food. I do believe if ratings here were on food quality alone, this restaurant would have 5 stars from everyone!"}
{"text":"Indian food is a taste many people are unaware of. Hot or Mild is one of the best Indian restaurants in the area. With new Indian places opening up its hard to meet the expectations of so many palates. Hot or Mild is where it's at. Great ingredients and just the right amount of spice, you'll find no better in the northeast Ohio area!"}
{"text":"I drove across 3 towns to get these for my mother says they taste like Samosa's in India. Well apparently not because they're raw inside and burned outside, definitely no stars"}
{"text":"I have been trying so hard to find a good affordable Indian restaurant in Cleveland and have once again failed. Everyone has complained about the wait which wasn't an issue for me...my issue was quality of food. Samosas were good. Lamb biryani was acceptable...could use more flavor but the lamb itself was not bad. Chicken tikka masala was so unimpressive I was disappointed. No flavor to the sauce, too many bell peppers, too few pieces of chicken which tasted as if they'd been cooked separate from the sauce. Masala chai was flavorless super hot milk. Garlic naan was good. I'd give the place another try but will def not be making a special trip out."}
{"text":"This place is my got to spot for eating chat and samosas. And I really love their batura it's really authentic. Although service could have been a little quicker."}
{"text":"Mmmmm Indian food!  Set up almost like a cafeteria/chipotle style, hot n mild is a good place to stop in for some good Indian food.  I definitely did not think it matches the spice level of its rival down the street (it was definitely much more milder), but still good. We got the combo meals of dal, chicken vindaloo, butter chicken and chicken tikka marsala. All were very good- we even got a side of garlic naan and the veg samosas. Very fast and good.  Seating is limited, but there are a couple of seats there.   The food is definitely milder here, but it's also very good as well. I recommend here- it definitely satisfied my hungry stomach."}
{"text":"The food quality was horrible. I never tasted such bad Indian food in Cleveland. This was my first and last try at this place. I ordered Chicken Achari, Chicken Tikka Masala and Samosa.Never tasted such horrible sourly tasted Chicken Tikka masala in my life.  I couldn't have a single bite, tasted like eating tamarind pulp. God help me, this was not end. I was super brave to order one Chicken Achari also. The photo in their website was super tempting. But  in reality it was a liquid gravy with four piece of chicken with again horrible sour taste. Only saving grace was Samosa."}
{"text":"Dont go there, they are the most disorganized store. When we were there, we learned that 2 customers had a very bad experience and yet we were foolish enough to order from them. We were promised that 10 am someone will be there with our order for a timed event. No one showed up Beware before going here"}
{"text":"Four stars for the food. Minus one (and close to two) for the ridiculous wait.  First, the food. Chicken tikka masala was classic. Palak paneer was a little watery, which diluted the flavor, but acceptable. Other choices were fine. The spicy dishes had a powerful kick. Lots of rice. I'm no expert on what constitutes \"real\" Indian cooking, but it looked like most of the other customers were.  I had plenty of time to consider that, because there were at least five customers or family groups waiting around when I got there, on a weekday evening. I had sent in my order, waited at home, and taken the long way to Hot or Mild ... And I still had to wait at least 20 minutes. (Figure close to an hour from the time I ordered.) Some of the people waiting when I arrived were still there when I left.  It wasn't a comfortable wait. No chairs, just backless hassocks. Cold enough that we all kept our coats and hats on."}
{"text":"I used the online ordering system through Square and it stated that it would be about a 40 minute wait for takeaway, and really, it was only 30 minutes. I ordered right before I left work and I received a text message at the end of my shift that it was ready. With that being said, I feel that the wait time for takeaway was reasonable, especially since I had a larger order.  Now for the food review: my husband and I have been eating at the Indian places on the west side, and we agree that Hot or Mild has had most flavorful and perfectly spiced curry dishes. Nothing was unbearably hot... or bland. It was just right. We ordered the Dal, Paneer Tikka Masala, several orders of naan, and samosas. Now we can't stop talking about going back. So even though we are out in North Royalton, we will be frequenting here!"}
{"text":"I have always ordered the chicken dum biryani. It used to be good. Since the past few orders, the quality has gone down drastically. The most recent order was so spicy and bad that I had to eat yogurt along with the biryani, just so that I could keep it down. I specifically asked for medium spicy and what I got was plate full of chillies. Look at the pick and see the number of chillies in my plate. There was no onion garnish nor any raita along with it. I'm never ordering from hot and mild again. The place sucks and whoever is taking orders and preparing dishes clearly has no idea what they're doing. I'm never going to this place again. Really bad!!!!"}
{"text":"I really didn't know what to expect when I tried Hot or Mild yesterday- especially since the only legit looking review gave it 2 stars... but I decided to try it anyways. It's purely a takeout restaurant. I went in around 2:30 in the afternoon and was the only customer. They have whatever curries they are serving that day laid out behind a counter- like Panda Express style, I'd say. And, you can order the snacks, breads, etc. from the menu. I ordered a Veg wrap and papdi chaat (fried dough pieces, topped with chick peas, onions, tomatoes, spicy and sweet chutneys, yogurt, spices, and thinner fried dough pieces) and was told it would be about 10-15 minutes. Not bad at all - but again, I was the only customer. After the fact, I decided to get one of the vegetarian curries that was set out - Paneer Tikka Masala. There's an option to get the \"Customer's Choice\" which is pretty much a combo meal with (*i think*) 2 curries, bread, fried rice (? did they mean biryani??), and some other things. I opted out of it and they just gave me rice with my Paneer Tikka.  I decided to wait in the store so walked to the front where there were a few couches. There's a TV for people who are waiting, but it wasn't working. There's also a decent size open area between the counter and these couches which could easily hold a few tables and chairs for people to dine in - or even more seating for people to wait, but right now its just empty, awkward space. I asked if they were planning on adding seating and they said no, they will remain strictly take out. They said since there isn't sufficient parking spaces, they won't be able to successfully do dine-in.  The total for my food was 18 dollars - not THAT bad if you think about the price of curry dishes alone at sit-down indian restaurants, but I would think a fast take-out restaurant would be cheaper.   The Papdi chaat was good. Each of the bigger fried dough pieces (papdi) seemed to be individually seasoned and were delish. I could probably have gotten a bag full of those and eaten them like chips. All the toppings on top were super flavorful. I thought the sweet chutney was pretty potent and overwhelming so I may ask for it on the side next time.   The Veg wrap was DELISH. It was pretty much freshly grilled vegetables (peppers, onions, cauliflower, carrots, peas, potatoes, etc- seasoned and mixed with some curry (I was told it's the chef's secret by the guy at the counter) - all wrapped in a thick roti/naan. I had a good 25-30 minute drive home and it was still nice and hot when I got home - and the bread was nice and thick that it really wasn't as soggy as I thought it would be.  I only tasted the Paneer Tikka Masala - b/c I gave it to my friend - but from what I tasted, it was super rich, creamy, and flavorful. I hate when Paneer Tikka is made very runny, and that was not the case with this dish.  Overall, the food was really good. The people behind the counter were friendly and fast - again, I was the only customer, so take that with a grain of salt. It's further from me than many indian restaurants I can get take-out from, but if I'm in the area or craving their Veg wrap again (which I def may), I'll be back. I'm sure it'll be busier and more successful on weekdays, but it was just empty when I went - Hope that changes for their sake."}
{"text":"Excellent. Delicious soft buttery garlicky naan, and the paneer tikka masala was super rich and deliciously seasoned. Also there is nice ambiance here and the service is kind and friendly :)  I would gladly take any of my friends or family here."}
