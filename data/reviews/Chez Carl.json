{"text":"A bit on the expensive side but good pizza (especially the Chuck Norris).

Last time I was there (party of 5) we had to wait 1 hour for a table. 

 It's one of the better restaurants on Nun's Island, but then again the competition isn't as strong as in most other parts of Montreal (unfortunately)."}
{"text":"This place has the best pizza in town. I definitely recommend the classic for a simple great tasting pizza.  Haven't had the burgers but from what i have seen, 2 people would be full from this plate."}
{"text":"Close to the office so we always go there for after-work drinks.

Very good pizza. I you like meat, try the Chuck Norris"}
{"text":"Had a dinner there with my family. I ordered a burger and a pepperoni pizza to share with my wife. We really liked both. The burgers were big, nice and juicy. The pizza was really great, on tasty thin crust.

We'll definitely dine there again!"}
{"text":"La pizza four a bois est leur spécialité , et c'est excellent ! Les entrées sont tout autant savoureuses. J'ai pris la salade grecque, très frais. Pour les amateurs de viande, la CHUCK NORRIS saura vous plaire. Bons desserts aussi !   Carte des vins variée, mais assez dispendieux. Bon point : vous aurez probablement des restes a apporter a la maison. N'oubliez pas de réserver les soirs de semaine, c'est très plein. Ils livrent partout sur l'Ïle !"}
{"text":"Chez Carl used to be a decent lunch place. However, my last visit was not positive. The place is simply not clean.

Upon arrival, we were given water. However, there were crumbs floating in my water. I swapped glasses with an empty seat to find crumbs in my new glass too! My friend pointed out that there were spider webs on the wall directly above my seat. Definitely not a great start.

When my vegetarian pizza arrived, it was soggy and covered in cheese. There was no finesse - just 1 slice of tomato slopped in each corner and a few other vegetables.

I would strongly recommend that other similar restaurants in the area be considered insetad."}
{"text":"Local favorite here on Nuns Island for Lunch and Dinner or just a drink after work.
Great selection of pizzas (their specialty) but also many other things.
Really great outdoor terrace for summer times :) 

Favorite Pizza: The Chez Carl"}
{"text":"I've been a couple more times now and tried their burger, linguini and pizza.

Everything is pretty good for a neighbourhood restaurant. My favourite is their pasta.

Only thing I don't like is that during the summer, they leave all their doors open and so bugs are everywhere. They are attracted to the inside lights and the outside lights. I always get bitten by mosquitos or find a bee mistaking the exit for my head."}
{"text":"I like this restaurant a lot! Generally on Nun's Island there are not a lot of good restaurants at all. But Chez Carl is really good and worthwhile to go to.

They have specialty pizza and are child friendly. There is a private parking lot so you don't need to search forever for a spot!

I would not recommend ordering it for delivery though, the pizza doesn't taste good, perhaps doesn't last during the delivery period. Its really great when you go there and experience it yourself.

PS - the bathrooms are clean and its child friendly!"}
{"text":"Don't bother looking at the menu - Order the Chuck Norris and be prepared for a great pizza"}
{"text":"I love the pizza of Chez Carl. The crust is perfect. Chuck Norris is a must try and the classics of pizza are as good as one can experience in the Italian pizza restaurants in Little Italy.  During the summer the outdoor patio is a wonderful place to be. One downside, when it is busy the service is really slow and the waiting time for food is more then an hour. Don't go on Friday night particularly during the summer! 8pm during week days works much more better."}
