{"text":"Bistro français apportez votre vin. Abordable, bonne bouffe, personnel sympathique. Au menu: ris de veau, bavette, rognons, filet de boeuf, etc. Très bonne adresse!"}
{"text":"Excellent service! I ate alone and couldn't be happier with where I chose.

I was a visitor in Montreal and didn't realize that I would have to bring my own wine to drink. The owner explained the process, directed me to a store down the street and even lent me an umbrella since it was raining (which he later insisted that I keep). 

I tried the beef shank which came with cauliflower soup as an appetizer. Everything was made fresh and came perfect to eat. I also tried the Brie, also quite tasty. For dessert I ate the creme brûlée. Not the best I've had but good nonetheless.

Overall I'd say that the service left the biggest impression on me. I will definitely return next time I'm in Montreal."}
{"text":"Yum yum yum! While walking along Rachel this weekend I spied the chalkboard announcing breakfast at Au 917. Intrigued, because I had been eyeing going there for dinner sometime, I did some digging and found out it was the folks behind Le Toasteur doing the breakfast thing. I'm really digging restaurants sharing spaces like this, it makes a lot of sense to use a restaurant to its fullest. 

So this morning we headed over and were we ever happy we did so! They have all the standard breakfast fare, and some interesting special dishes too. I tried the special French toast sandwich, with egg, ham and cheese sandwiched between two slices of French toast topped with fruit with maple syrup on the side. The perfect sweet and salty combo. D had the breakfast poutine, a HUGE portion, very rich and delicious. We could have shared it and been quite satisfied. 

What's really fun is that the vibe is casual yet refined, unlike a lot of breakfast places that veer more towards casual diner. They were playing great music, a good mix of late 90s/early00s like Franz Ferdinand, Moby and BV3000. The service was great, but it was easy as we were the only customers on a Tuesday morning. I could see this being a great place to dine on a sunny weekend morning, with the windows wide open for people watching. 

I will definitely be back, and I hope other people start going too, because this is a great place to have in the neighborhood, a stone's throw from Lafontaine Park and right on the Rachel bike path."}
{"text":"I was first introduced to this restaurant about 4 years ago and I have gone back at least 3 times a year since. 

The two or so times that I went in a large group, we stayed until closing since we just enjoyed sitting and drinking. After the crowd had thinned out even the staff joined in for a few drinks. How can you not love this place?

The ambience and decoration of the restaurant are reminiscent of a small french bistro. The restaurant is small and cozy. The service is friendly and efficient. The food is delicious and very consistent. 


For the quality of the food the price is very reasonable, especially since it is an apportez-votre vin (bring your own wine)."}
{"text":"We came here for dinner when were visiting and staying in the neighborhood. It is quite small, and staff is very friendly. They also explained some menu items as we did not speak French. The food was absolutely amazing, and so affordable! We loved the food so much that when we were leaving on Monday morning we stopped again for breakfast! I would definitely come back again and would recommend to all!"}
{"text":"TERRIBLE. My fiance had bought a groupon for this restaurant and tried to take me out to this restaurant. They refused to accept our groupon online coupon and told us they would only accept the printed version- even if it was clearly written on the coupon that either version was accepted.
Not once was this mentioned when we called to reserve. We asked to speak with the manager. He in turn told us the same thing. His tone was condencending and very rude. We left without even having one bite of food. I don't recommend giving this restaurant any business as they clearly do not care about their patrons."}
{"text":"All was good until I asked for mustard to go with the Bavette (flank steak) and they brought yellow mustard out of a Heinz squeeze bottle instead of Dijon. This IS NOT a French restaurant!"}
{"text":"Was here with hubby n a friend, and that evening is memorable.
The place gives average first impression, but when you leave with a memory to cherish 'coz of its out of the league concept of french 6 course meal. There are few items on menu, but almost everyone's request is accommodated, even for people like me- lacto-vegan.

The food they serve, is superior quality and tastes amazing, I did not like their risotto much but everything else was amazing.
The quantity they serve is perfect it looks less when you start , but by the end you are so full and satisfied. You need to spare 3-4 hours for the dining experience. 

Cons: reservation, need to make reservation in 10-15 days advance even for a weekday.

Pros: its BYOW, great place for a dinner date.

Tip: Make reservations  much ahead, reach early to find parking :) and go hungry :) You will be fed well!"}
{"text":"Super cute classic French style bistro with wonderful prix fixe that is just spectacular.  We walked in late the day after Xmas and they were kind enough to seat us and offer some of the best service I've had in a restaurant.  The server was incredibly sweet, kind, funny, generous, and patient.  We ordered the beef and duck breast, and both were made to absolute perfection. Their poutine is small but exquisite.  Bring your bottle of wine and enjoy it with your meal, with no corkage fee.  Lovely, relaxing, classic."}
{"text":"Malgré un service de qualité, la poutine déjeuner était trop salée, avait un goût de brûlé et n'avait pas beaucoup de viande. Déception totale quant à la nourriture. 

Le café était médiocre. Pour le prix, on peut trouver beaucoup  mieux ailleurs."}
