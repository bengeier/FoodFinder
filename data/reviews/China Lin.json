{"text":"This is my favorite American-style Chinese restaurant in Pittsburgh. I've eaten at quite a few and this place is cheap, consistent, and everything is freshly made right when you order it (yes, its frozen, but they don't do that giant vat of crap simmering all night thing). 

The family that runs the place is really nice and they are quick and efficient. If you're looking for gourmet, you're at the wrong place - but if you just want solid, tasty, cheap Chinese food, China Lin's the right place.

As a highlight - their lunch specials at $4.95 and you get a TON of food. GREAT place for lunch."}
{"text":"If you think China Express is good then this is the place for u. I ordered here based on the 4-star review, and I ended up throwing everything away. You get what you pay for I guess. I ordered soup, Lomein, and chicken and broccoli with brown rice for $17. Everything was terrible and I guess brown rice now means the worst fried rice in history. To the previous reviewers....try Jimmy Wans you will be blown away."}
{"text":"I love this place!! I have been eating here for years.  It's a friendly, family owned business and they always remember regular customers.  It's my fav place to grab some take-out from.  The portions of food are generous,  and the prices are good too.  I have never had anything I wasn't satisfied with from here."}
{"text":"I ordered the fried shrimp,teriyaki chicken,chicken with broccoli,boneless spare ribs and teriyaki beef.
The fried shrimp was excellent,the teriyaki chicken was good but kind of dry. The chicken with broccoli was the worse I've ever had.It wasn't seasoned at all and the sauce was runny. Don't try it. Same goes for the teriyaki beef I will never ever order it again. It was tough & unseasoned.The boneless spare ribs were amazing,I got a small order and it was actually a lot."}
{"text":"When you want some classic Chinese food fast, this is the place to order from. The price is great, the foods alright, and it is seriously fast. I honestly think they cook the food in the car while delivering it. The delivery driver is even wearing an apron, which only supports my theory."}
{"text":"The service was fast. Food is good. I usually get it to go but I wanted to have dinner with a friend . It was memorable ."}
{"text":"Best Chinese food in the area~Hands down.
Inexpensive and fast delivery. 
What a great find!"}
{"text":"Had our first visit here today. Pretty good. Kind of a weird little place, but the food was good for the price. What I didn't like was no fountain drinks, you have to buy bottles of pop or water. But we had fried dumplings, and two General Tso's platters. $24 was pretty good. I'll probably try delivery soon."}
{"text":"I ate here I ate here for the first time tonight food was wonderful and delivery service off the chart very polite very kind and very wonderful said I would recommend this place to anyone they're sweet the kind and the food is great I had an order for two different addresses and they got it right so please eat here"}
{"text":"This is a great place to get standard, American-style Chinese food. It is very inexpensive and they make the food when you order it instead of taking it from a pan thats been in a warmer all day. Great lunch specials."}
{"text":"If slightly refrigerated noodles mixed with Jiffy peanut butter thrown on a bed of shredded lettuce with red pepper flakes labeled as \"spicy cold noodles\" is wrong, then I don't want to be right. 

Nope, it was super wrong. Also the fortune cookie was so stale I could bend it. Broccoli garlic was great though!"}
{"text":"My wife and I like this place very much. When we walked in the door we were treated like family.

We tried the hot and sour soup, the fried crab wontons, and the general tsos chicken.

The general tsos chicken was delicious. We got takeout and the chicken was still crispy whenever we got at home. This is one mark of a good general tsos chicken in my opinion. The crab wontons were equally delicious. Then again I've never had a bad crab wonton.

The hot and sour soup left something to be desired but maybe we just came on an off day we're haven't picked or flavor of soup that we like the best yet.

Will be excited to go back to this restaurant and visit them more often."}
{"text":"Let's start by saying I've only gotten delivery from here, so I can't speak to the actual \"in-house\" experience.

Now that that's out of the way, there is a holy trinity when it comes to delivery food, especially Chinese. Tasty, affordable and a quick arrival. China Lin comes with a hairs width of hitting all three.

The prices are fantastic. They do that thing that I love at Chinese places where they offer both a Pint option and a Quart option for most of their dishes. Solid. I was able to get a breathtaking amount of food for around $25 dollars, including Hot and Sour soup for $1.80, which seems joyfully illegal.

As for the delivery, I received my food a full 25 minutes before the estimated delivery time. The driver was friendly and professional. It was everything you could want from a delivery experience.

Now, on to the food. The food was good! It wasn't great. It had it's issues. The chicken fried rice, for instance, lacked salt. When I say that, I mean there was no salt in it, an unusual problem for fried rice in my experience. The cheese wontons were good, if a bit chewy, and the General Tsos was straight up standard.

No socks were knocked off. No taste-buds set aflame with joy, it was just an evening of good, standard, serviceable Chinese food with world class service and an incredible price."}
{"text":"Ordered vegetable fried rice .The rice is not cooked properly and fried rice tastes bad .price  is really inexpensive but food is not up to mark as regular Chinese restaurants."}
{"text":"China Lin is my go-to local place for Chinese food.  It is not upscale gourmet food, basic Americanized Chinese food, but good.  The portions are huge and the family is so sweet, and they remember regulars like me.  Once I ordered from a different address, and they said, \"Oh?  You move?\" - LOL.

The steamed dumplings are good and I also like the crab rangoon.  A good entree is the sweet and sour chicken.  My Dad likes the General Tso's chicken, although his order was not super spicy, so you probably would have to ask for it spicy.

I live in Lawrenceville and it usually gets here in 20 minutes, although they cook everything to order.  They delivery guys are polite and very nice, too, and come right up to the door."}
{"text":"Men who deliver my food was very rude was  mad I didn't have a large enough tip said fuck me bitch very unprofessional"}
{"text":"Our office orders takeout from here once or twice a week and every time the food has been good. It's consistent and the delivery service is fast and friendly."}
{"text":"Very good, the delivery guy always gets to our house in Morningside within 30 minutes, awesome service!!!"}
{"text":"Good prices, big portions, and a friendly staff. Pickup for my takeout order was quick. 10 minutes. I ordered the Shrimp Lo Mein and it was really good! Not too greasy. My wife and kids ordered Sweet and Sour Chicken and it was good also. The chicken was fresh and tasted great, however my wife thought the sauce was a little runny, but still really good. She prefers thicker sauce. The egg rolls were also very tasty (also not too greasy)!

It's not fancy, and in the middle of a somewhat junky shopping center, but they have seating inside and do takeout. They also do delivery I believe. 

All in all, it's a great standard American style Chinese restaurant.  We'll definitely go back!"}
{"text":"I get this place all the time for take-out. They have decent Chinese food that satisfies any late night or after work-too tired to cook-lazy day easy meal needs. I didn't enjoy their meat dishes however, they excel with their soups/dumplings and lo-mein."}
{"text":"I've ordered delivery a number of times now, and I have only good things to say. Delivery is quick, the food is fantastic (particularly the Mongolian Beef and Curry Chicken), it's always still piping hot on arrival, and the portions are huge for the price. I'm a tiny person, so with the $15 delivery minimum, the leftovers end up being good for three or four meals. The in-house experience was equally enjoyable when I visited with my boyfriend, and we both left very much satisfied."}
{"text":"This is a new restaurant for me, since my usual has changed to sushi lately. I got curry chicken with onions and it was deelish. Also have ordered the shrimp version of this dish and loved it, too. The serving is so large I ate it for two dinners and a snack! The dumplings also were very good. I found the spicy food to be too spicy, so I asked for it to be made a little less spicy and got my request with no problem. The food is very good and China Lin will be my go to Chinese from now on."}
{"text":"Ordered Egg drop soup, Crab Rangoon, General Tso's chicken, mushroom egg foo young , steamed dumplings and some other stuff to be delivered. All the food tasted good but although it was delivered 20 min. earlier than  I was told it would be, all but the soup and the egg foo young was only room temperature . The chicken in the Gen.  Tso was dry and tough like it was sitting around for a while. It may be because I ordered after 6:30pm . I will try again, but earlier."}
{"text":"They have a huge menu, the prices are awesome and the bathrooms are always clean. They do have a delivery charge but 99% of the time I pick up the order or have someone pick it up for me.  They used to have a buffet but they stopped it a couple of years ago; at one point they had the unit next door (formerly Curves) and tried to make it a larger dine-in section but most people wanted delivery or take-out. 

Not sure if the wonton soup is homemade or not (doubt it) and the eggrolls (shrimp) are frozen but what do you want for $1.35?  If you are ordering any of the \"beef and broccoli\" or similar plates and you don't like a variety of vegetables (carrots, green peppers, onion, mushroom etc) you have to tell them when you order.  Even when I tell them no green pepper or no onion, sometimes it gets added so call them and check the receipt to make sure the order was taken correctly. 

I am giving them five stars for fast pick up service, low prices and friendly wait staff if you are eating in. The only con is they don't have fountain soda any more so if you order something that's hot or spicy you might have to get an extra bottle of soda."}
