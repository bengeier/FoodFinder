{"text":"Super sub is not fancy, and completely awesome. The subs are made with good ingredients and love. I get cravings for the Assorted - $5.99 with a pop! I have actually never tried anything else, but there are all kinds of the basic subs as well as wraps. They have bags of chips, and that's it. Great value, and the owner and staff are super friendly.   They've been there a long time, and the decor is charmingly dated (but clean!). There are pictures of Northern Dancer on the wall, still majestic at his retirement stable. There are a few stools along the windows, but it's mostly a takeout place."}
{"text":"I have driven by this place many times . So finally I had to try it . I had a assorted sub . Old school on white bread not toasted . Just the way a sub should be. This baby was huge bread was fresh meat also fresh . It brought old school memory's . So good .  The service was great place was old worm but very clean ."}
{"text":"I had driven paste here many times, and the huge SUPER SUBMARINE sign always struck my curiosity. Maybe I just love alliteration? Or maybe I wondered what made the submarine... super? Anyways, I finally went there and I was definitely pleased.  Super Submarine doesn't have all of the flashy options that subway has like the six kinds of breads, or the twenty different toppings, but what they do have is someone who is going to construct a sub with care. I can't remember the last time I had a sub so well constructed. I got it to go and when I unwrapped it at home it was still a perfectly constructed submarine. They may not have tons of toppings, but they have all the ones that matter. (lettuce, tomatoes, cheese, green pepper, red onion, hot peppers, olives) Extra points for having green, not black, olives.  The sub tasted nostalgic to me. It reminded me of a place my dad used to buy subs called Big John's back in Kitchener-Waterloo. Soft white bun, plenty of mayo, and all the other toppings you need."}
{"text":"Mom and pop place. Delicious. Friendly. Simple. I crave a sub from this fine establishment even as I type this."}
