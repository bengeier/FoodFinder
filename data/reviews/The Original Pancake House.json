{"text":"Good place. Specially for large groups with children. Lots of choice on the menu. Their Swedish pancakes are great."}
{"text":"Food was good but pricey. Gave you large portions enough to share. Restroom was disgusting."}
{"text":"Gluten-Free paradise! This is the first GF meal I've had with a \"bread-y\" component (pancakes) that didn't make me miss the real thing. First of all they have a pretty good GF selection and most of thier syrups are GF. Second, well thier GF pancakes made me cry. I literally teared up. They were better than the NOT GF kind. Amazing! Third, the waitress we got was extremely knowledgeable about GF and answered several of my questions before I even asked.   Easiest stress-free Gluten-Free dining experience I've ever had.  Thanks for a wonderful Saturday brunch for the family."}
{"text":"Enjoyed this place a lot! Our server was friendly and provided good tips on what to order. The buttermilk pancakes are very sweet...almost suggary...so I wouldn't recommend. The Mexican burrito with their special green salsa is one of the best I've had in Ohio. Must try!"}
{"text":"Let me preface this review by saying that I do, in fact, have a hard time spending any large sum of money on a pancake.  They're really easy, quick, and cheap to make at home and it irks me when restaurants bump up the price for a stack.  Thank being said- I felt like all prices, portions and quality were wonderful at The Original Pancake House.  I had an order of Three Little Pigs in Blankets.  The pancakes were moist, with a much better flavor than I anticipated.  I loved the sweet and salty of the pancake with the sausage.    My boyfriend ordered Banana Pancakes.  (He's insisting there were walnuts but I do not see such a dish on their menu whilst checking online) He really enjoyed them, but I did think they were a little too sweet for my taste.  The reason I'm giving the Original Pancake House a 3 star rating is because of it's location and competition.  Not only is it right next door to Denny's (say what you will about their food) but it's right down the road from Gab N Eat and Barb's. The difficult parking lot, that is always full, would definitely sway me to pick Gab N Eat or Barb's- especially if I wasn't in the mood for pancakes."}
{"text":"I thought place was ok. I ordered bacon pancakes I felt so disappointed I had to send them back order something else. The bacon I thought was very fatty and hardly cooked."}
{"text":"Best omelets and cheesy potatoes! Looking to try something new? The Dutch baby is incredible. Always delicious, worth waiting in line for."}
{"text":"I was here with some awesome college loves and didn't know what to think of the place at first.  I mean, they were raving about how good it was but I didn't see how one pancake was better than another.  It's located inside Green Valley Ranch in the District, a little bit of a drive if you're coming from the West but nothing to complain about.  We had to wait, but it wasn't terribly long, and our waitress turned out to be a sweetheart.  I ordered pancakes with strawberries and whip on top.  When I got it, the strawberries looked so perfect I almost didn't want to eat them, almost.  Every one's plates looked incredibly delicious actually, and considering that no food was left uneaten, they must have been.  My mouth was so delighted by my choice it's still thanking me.  The whipped cream was more like vanilla icing which just made it that much better.  A breakfast dessert is basically what it was, if only every morning meal could be such a treat."}
{"text":"This place is delicious. Prices seem a little high for breakfast until you see how much food you get. I always have leftovers-which makes a great Monday morning treat. Expect long lines on Sunday mornings but you can always go take a stroll through several nearby stores while you wait-it's definitely worth it!"}
{"text":"Decent service and environment, horrible cook. Omelette was atrociously overcooked and would not have been served by anyone who knows what one is supposed to look like. Bacon was also ridiculously overcooked and resembled beef jerky more than anything in consistency and color. Previous experiences here were great, but this one was pathetic. Overall, a massive disappointment."}
{"text":"Awesome pancakes and sausage, my server Jennifer was friendly, efficient and entertaining to say the least!!!  I'd definitely go back!!!"}
{"text":"Great pancake or omelet place, wish they stayed open later on the weekends, it always has a 20 minute wait, but always great food"}
{"text":"If you see a long line,  there's a reason for it. .. the food  is THAT GOOD!  (My husband and I had eaten at the Original Pancake House restaurants in Chicago and really enjoyed the food. This one is every bit their equal)    The pancakes and crepes are delicious,  the omelettes are light and fluffy,  and the gluten free pancakes are exceptional.  But the best part of the meal is by far the BACON!!! Unlike any other that we've tasted,  it's crispy and thick cut,  and completely head and  shoulders above any other's. My mouth is watering at the thought of it!     We also enjoy the warmth of this family owned restaurant;  the owners are always present making customers feel at  home and making sure that the restaurant is clean and comfortable for their diners.    Do yourself a favor. .. stop in for a terrific meal,  and don't forget to order the BACON!!!"}
{"text":"It's hard to believe that the two pancake houses are owned by the same person.  This branch is unbelievably better. Everything served was delicious and prepared well. Coffee was regularly filled and they brought us water without us asking for it, unlike the other branch where they have signs on the table telling you to ask for water."}
{"text":"I've been a regular customer at the South Side Chicago Pancake house for almost a decade and was very happy to find one in the Cleveland area when I moved here.  However my first visit to this branch left me shocked. The main difference is the quality of food. My wife ordered the Veggie Omelette and it came floating in this disgusting liquid. I don't know if it was from the vegetables, but neither of us could eat it.  I ordered the Huevos Rancheros and it wasn't as bad, but was not good either. Just a huge mess on a plate.  The staff was courteous but nothing like other Pancake Houses where they are extremely friendly and make you want to come back. There was also a note on every table saying you have to ask for water if you like or something along those lines that I can't quite remember. It made the whole vibe feel really cheap and not welcoming. Not to mention our coffee was not refilled once until we asked for it. Again, not something I expected from a Pancake House.  Instead of a warm and inviting atmosphere with good food, this place made us feel like they just wanted our money and for us to leave asap so they can do the same to the next customer."}
{"text":"The service was absolutely horrible.  Our waitress took our drink order twice and still forgot what I was getting.  The food was 4 stars but the service was a 2.    This wasn't the first time I have had bad service.  If the bacon wasn't so thick and good I would never go back."}
{"text":"Server wasn't really that nice. He never told us his name and had an attitude. Plopped the plates down and got our order wrong. Didn't really check on us only to say thank you when handing us a 40 dollar check. The place was over priced and with bad service on top of that. I won't be coming back unless tricked. Food was good however, only redeeming quality for me."}
{"text":"We ate here for the first time this morning and really enjoyed it. The french toast was wonderful and the bacon was delicious.  Mt husband had a waffle and Canadian bacon and really enjoyed his as well.  Our server was friendly, quick and attentive.  The atmosphere was pleasant and the restaurant was clean. We will be back for sure."}
{"text":"The Original Pancake had good food and okay service.  My father, sister, and I went here for Father's Day for lunch.  Our server took a while to take our orders for drinks, about 5 minutes, and gave my father and my sister iced tea without any ice.  I ordered the short stack of butter milk pancakes and a bowl of strawberries and cream.  Once my food came, the pancakes looked delicious, but the strawberries I was given had no whipped cream.  Besides that, the pancakes were delicious and fluffy!  I was also glad that the restaurant listed the calories, which most restaurants do not.  Overall, the food was good and the service was okay.  I would not come to this place regularly, but once in a while for some nice breakfast food, sure!"}
{"text":"I really love the food here. However, the service isn't bringing me back anymore. We were sat down and it took 15 minutes for someone to even come take a drink order. I asked for a cup of coffee and noticed that there wasn't any creamer at the table. When she poured it, I asked her for some creamer. I see her going through all of her tables then back to mine for our food order. Still no creamer. Then she must have noticed my frustrations and put one and one together. I finally for creamer. Now to stir my coffee - yep. No flatware. By the time we got flatware, the cup of coffee wasn't hot anymore. Halfway through my meal, my coffee cup was empty. Did I get a refill? Nope. 2.49 for one cold cup of coffee. Also, 5.69 for a SIDE of biscuits and gravy? You've got to be kidding me."}
{"text":"The apple pancake was greasy and overrated. I don't think it was all that."}
{"text":"Always prompt service, hot coffee, and great food, I just wish they served pumpkin pancakes year round! Although the super-pulpy orange juice isn't my favorite."}
{"text":"My most favorite breakfast place EVER!  Indulge in the Dutch Baby when I come here. And the bacon is awesome!  The service is great the staff is friendly. It's my weekend place to go!"}
{"text":"Stop in there today with my fiancée . The food was delicious . Home fries and eggs with side of bacon and sausage it's enough for 2 people. And he Order the cornbeef hash. Comes with a side of pancakes . I can't wait to go again. O yeah the best fresh squeezed orange juice ."}
{"text":"Yummy but overpriced for a chain. I like the cherry pancakes. Their homemade whip cream is really good. I didn't like their ordinary link sausage, latte or corned beef hash. Stick to their specialty, the cakes!"}
{"text":"Went to this place for the first time last weekend. Went at about 11 a.m. and there was about a 20-minute wait..not too bad. The menu is overwhelmingly huge, but luckily we had already picked out what we wanted while we were waiting for our table.  I'm not a big fan of sweet type of food for breakfast (which is a shame, because they had some amazing-sounding options), so I got the kielbasa scrambler, and it was VERY good. Good portion, good price, and very tasty.   Boyfriend got the Dutch baby. There is a little bit of an extra wait for that, but it's worth it. It was amazing! He ate every bite. Apparently, it's their classic dish.   The place is decorated kind of fancy-like. But the customers around us seemed kind of...snooty or something. I don't know. It seemed like a very conservative kind of place, where you might go with the family after church. Which is fine, because it's all about the food, but this isn't somewhere I'd go and feel totally comfortable, personally."}
{"text":"I like it. when I want breakfast and don't want to be worried if it'll be good or not I go here."}
{"text":"Second time going here - have to write a review because I love it so much. Came on a Saturday morning: if you don't want to wait at least 20 minutes, GET HERE BEFORE 9AM! They're efficient and there's some seating to wait, but especially if you have more than like 2 people, try to get there early.   Servers are quick and efficient and good about refilling the coffee. I ordered the \"Blueberry Delight\" - 6 delicious pancakes with blueberries and white chocolate chips, a combination I've never tried before but I don't think I'll ever have anything else! They supply you with a generous amount of butter, syrup, compote, and are quick to get you more if you're like me and like to go a little crazy. I also got a side of sausage patties, and I must say this is the first breakfast place I've been to where I was actually satisfied with the size of sausage patties.  My friend got their famous Dutch Baby (basically a very egg-y pancake with powdered sugar) and while personally the taste just isn't for me, she loved it.   Our waitress did a great job despite the Saturday morning rush craziness, and the manager (I believe that's who he was) came by every table to personally ask how everyone was doing.  This is, in my opinion, the BEST pancake spot in Cleveland. Get here early, but be prepared to not be hungry the rest of the day!"}
{"text":"I usually get the well done potato pancakes  with maple syrup and butter and a side of bacon."}
{"text":"This place has gone down hill terribly!  Our chocolate chip pancakes had about 5 chips in a tall stack!  Embarrassing..."}
{"text":"This Original Pancake House isn't like the others! The food isn't impressing. On many occasions My family and I have had dirty plates and silverware, cold food, and horrible service. On our last visit close to closing time, which was a to go order had two hairs in the eggs! It was quite disgusting. The next day the manager was very rude and didn't want to do anything about the situation! We won't be back! Beware!"}
{"text":"Hearty food, quick, friendly service, reasonable prices. Solid breakfast joint."}
{"text":"I dream about this place.  I wish they were open later in the day, but that is what makes it special.  Never had a bad meal yet and the decaf coffee is just as fresh and hot as the regular, which is something I don't see very often outside of a coffee shop."}
{"text":"I liked the one across town on the west side, but the one at GVR seemed dirty and gross when we ate there. the food was not very good compared to the other one, i will ate GVR cafe any day over this place."}
{"text":"I swear there is crack in the pancakes.  I don't like pancakes or crack but whatever they are serving has turned me into a fat kid in a candy store."}
{"text":"The Original Pancake House Make Everything from scratch. The Omelette's are excellent. Pancakes are good. Excellent Customer Service. BIG Plus!  Definitely worth your time and Money."}
{"text":"delicious!!! really fresh ingredients, everything tastes like its made from scratch."}
{"text":"There was a long wait when we came in, but we decided to stay and give it a chance. We were seated in a smaller back room which was more cozy than the larger room. We were greeted promptly by our server and we ended up ordering a Irish and western omelet by her reccomendation. They were absolutely delicious. The long wait was made up for by the quality of the food and excellent service. I believe our server's name was Sarah.  Thanks for an excellent brunch, we will be sure to stop by again!"}
{"text":"Straight up pancake house, which is exactly what I was looking for. Bacon is phenomenal! Banana pancakes and eggs were standard fare which is fine.  Before I came here I was reading some reviews and it seems like a lot of people complained about the wait staff. I don't know why, cause not only was my waitress attentive, but I watched her bring out and return 3 cups of coffee for a nice old man who didn't care for it and was trying different combinations of sugar and cream, and she didn't even think twice about doing it."}
{"text":"Just a weird vibe in this place. Wasn't always this way.  The food is decent but that's not enough for me to recommend it."}
{"text":"My friend swears by this place, frequently craving the peanut butter chocolate chip pancakes, so I agreed to join. There was nobody at the hostess desk, and it was a good 3 minutes before anyone even came around the corner to tell us to wait. It was a Tuesday morning, maybe about 10 tables of patrons, yet it was almost 10 minutes before we were seated. I imagine this place looked nice when it opened, with its high ceilings and floor to ceiling windows, but since opening, this place has become quite dingy. The carpet of the dining area Easley stained and bunched up in places, and littered with pieces of food, spilled packets of sugar, and discarded straw wrappers. The pancakes, although nothing unique, are delicious. I will give them that. I ordered the Greek omelette, which was practically football-sized. However, I found the sun-dried tomatoes to be sour (which is common with cheap canned tomatoes) to the point that the omelette was near inedible. I've eaten at dive diners. In fact, I don't really mind them. What really was the final straw for me was the bill, which was almost $20 a person. For that price, the service and quality of this restaurant was subpar, at the very least. I would choose a local mom and pop diner over this place any day."}
{"text":"One of the best breakfasts spots around. You will never leave here hungry (huge portions). Lots of great pancakes and omelettes to choose from. Good coffee and service in this large restaurant. Sometimes a small wait for tables and difficulty parking due to the popularity of the place."}
{"text":"This is such a hidden gem in the North Hills of Pittsburgh. I speak as a person who is gluten intolerant-- this place cares about providing a place for gluten intolerant people.  Going out to breakfast is a delightful treat at this place. There are MULTIPLE items my GF child and I can choose to eat. And innumerable delicious choices for my wheat- eating family. Cannot recommend highly enough."}
{"text":"I've been here multiple times with friends and family and I've loved everything I've had!  I've had the buttermilk pancakes, chocolate chip pancakes, pumpkin pancakes, Swedish pancakes, and a blueberry blintz.  The bacon and sausage are delicious, you can tell it's of good quality.  They use real maple syrup and cream.  The prices are very reasonable and the food is of high quality."}
{"text":"I enjoy this place for their pancakes and their eggs which they always cook just the way I like them, crispy on the outside and the yoke still a little bit runny  Some of their waffle and omelette combinations are interesting and my kids seem to enjoy the waffles with fruit on top"}
{"text":"Excellent pancakes!! I ordered the 3 2 1 and got everything I wanted in a breakfast: 3 pancakes, 2 pieces of bacon, and 1 egg. It was great and the service was equally as good. I also liked how they were playing alternative music! I would definitely come back to try their other options."}
{"text":"Outstanding experience with 11 adults and 8 kids under age 3! The food was delicious, as always, and the service was attentive and coordinated for our large party with children. They made certain to order all the kids right away so that their food came without wait. They went out of their way to make our experience welcome. And did I mention that food was also delicious! Will come back again soon! Thank you."}
{"text":"Me and my boyfriend go here for breakfast quite a lot. It's packed on weekend mornings but we've never waited more than 25 minutes. Everything I've gotten has been so good. The French Toast is really something special and I've fallen in love with it. My boyfriend always gets a crepe or omelet and always says how good they are. The reason I gave 4 stars instead of 5 is because I love my bacon and I don't like theirs. They only have this bacon that's super thick and hard to even chew. Not my style. But I love everything else."}
{"text":"I'm finding it challenging to draft a review that will come off subjective and true - I swear none of my friends or family have any connections, nor did the manager slip me a fiver or free iced tea, the food was just incredible. So now the review;  Virtually every bite was better than the last. We had strawberry pancakes, blueberry pancakes, bacon and some kind of amazing Mexican omelette and a crepe ordered after we saw a table nearby and couldn't resist. The menu had not one but two European specialties I've had before and love, Dutch oven and their version of an apple cake, and it was tough to decide on the Mexican omelette instead but he server sold me in describing the oven baked melty meaty chili infused taste volcano. It was the sort of omelette type creation that has me writing a review 13 hours later as I eat the nuked leftovers. The crepe was the best I've had at a restaurant, ever, and my only regret is not ordering some to take home and eat right now. The food arrived quick, the atmosphere was busy but not chaotic, and the bill was beyond reasonable for the food we received. I've been eating breakfast a long time, it's nearly an everyday occurrence for me and this mornings experience ranks in easily the top ten best breakfasts I've ever had, only slightly below a Bay Area French soul food breakfast joint with a line around the block. My wife's food was equally good, so good that we basically didn't talk until the bill arrived, just devoured out food. While that silence may have contributed to the otherworldly experience, it was the food, and the service that grants this restaurant five stars. My only wish is that it was closer, really it's given me a reason to visit family who lives in the area more often...and although I'm not really looking forward to that, I am thrilled about the reason to hike to rocky river and smash here again. One last thing, besides kudos to the wait staff and the kitchen and the management who was present and rapping with tables personally--- whoever is responsible for maintaining the cleanliness of the bathroom has done a fantastic job. Sometimes great non-corporate little breakfast spots seem to have this sort of filthy vibe to them, and a restroom that showcases it. Not the case at all. Only complaint I can come up with is the lack of accompanying beverage selection, a chicory coffee or maybe even a single origin blend or bottled regional soda  would have complemented my meal well. Really really great, hope this place thrives in that location, they've certainly earned it as demonstrated today."}
{"text":"Our group planned on Denny's which was closed for renovating, so we ate at OPH instead. Our group of 3 was seated as soon as we walked in around 9:30 on a Sunday morning, in the back area. Our server was friendly, she seemed young, and unfortunately couldn't answer our question about the type of filling in the blintzes. She also forgot to bring extra silverware, straws, and coffee creamer after running back and forth a few times to get our drink orders.  The 4 slices of thick cut bacon could've used a bit more cooking to be crispy, sunny side eggs were cooked nicely, and the stack of pumpkin pancakes were a bit on the thin side. The strawberry blintz was about the size of a good burrito, my daughter couldn't tell if the filling was cream cheese based, or not. She did like it, but not enough to eat the whole blintz. Our fellow diner, had ordered 2 of the crepes, but only got one in his order. So he wasn't too happy about that oversight.   My impression is that this is a nice place to try, but nothing I'd plan on making it a regular spot. Extra training for service would help a lot, and the parking lot could use some extra space as well."}
{"text":"The pancakes are delicious, the whipped cream is homemade, and the service is always speedy, which is much appreciated as a family with young children. We've been here 3 or 4 times and it's been a pleasure every time."}
{"text":"Good breakfast food, and decent service."}
{"text":"food is good, service is crappy, and the parking is horrible at the green tree location, wont return their again"}
{"text":"Breakfast was fine until I saw a waiter step behind a booth to pick his nose before continuing his food delivery. Call me old fashioned, but I prefer to think a good pick should be followed by a good hand wash."}
{"text":"Very disappointed. The owner and his wife/manager were very rude regarding the seating and meal  accommodations. Waitress was slow, napkin box on table was empty and when told she took the box and brought three napkins with food and beverage on the corners. I picked up a box from another table. We would have left if not someone in the party was elderly and slightly disabled. Only good thing was the bacon."}
{"text":"The French Rolled Omlettes are delicious and fluffy for a pancake place!  Will come back again!"}
{"text":"Good big breakfasts. Been here twice and we were not disappointed. Large portions of breakfast fare. Less of a chain feeling than IHOP. I you do not want to wait go on weekdays."}
{"text":"Coming into town on way to Beachwood, I checked Yelp to see where to eat breakfast, we were lucky to not hit a busy time, the server was wonderful, we chose potatoes very good, crepes excellent, coffee very good, what a wonderful place and we felt the prices were ok compared to how large the portions were.  We will be coming here each time we are in the area."}
{"text":"Always a friendly smile from the staff...a full cup of coffee...and good food.  The family owned place makes you feel at home.  The bacon waffle is to die for."}
{"text":"It's pretty hard to impress me with breakfast, but this place does it.  The green Chile omelet is just awesome - house made tomatillo sauce is great.  The show stealer is the bacon...it can't really be described.  It's just good.  I'd get here by 9:00 on a weekend  or you'll be waiting!"}
{"text":"This is no joke the best breakfast I have ever eaten. I get the Mexican Benedict. Unbelievably good"}
{"text":"The food is usually excellent, service has been hit or miss most times but the biggest problem is the management. The young female manager with short black hair is rude unorganized and unprofessional. My family and I eat there often but after my last experience with her when we had to wait 35minutes for a table because they skipped over us and she then tried to blame us saying we said a highchair. Never once did we say a highchair my daughter is 5weeks old and we were holding here. Never once approached the table or apologized, the only saving grace was our servers who's name I will not mention because i feel that they might hold it against her. We will not be back too many other options in the area that actually appreciate they customers and the business. STAY AWAY!"}
{"text":"A lot of pancakes and breakfast menu. I visited here for just stopped by traveling from NJ  Chicago. Stayed at Aloft(good hotel).  Very good place for having breakfast with kids.(we had 11 months old baby) Their handmade sausage was perfect! Pancake was decent. It's not amazing but you can get decent breakfast here. I wish we have this restaurant near our house!"}
{"text":"I've been here twice and each time I've ordered the potato pancakes with sour cream and apple sauce. I've never had to wait more than 5 mins. for a table and food comes out promptly. Servers are attentive and friendly. The portions are huge, I've never been able to finish my plate.   My mom is also a picky eater and orders the corn beefed hash and likes it here. It's hard to find a place where they make it to her liking."}
{"text":"I was in the mood for a decent breakfast on a early Saturday morning.   There wasn't a wait and we were sat very quickly.  The service was awesome. The coffee was good. This is about where the good things ended.     I got the eggs/bacon/pancake special.    The pancakes were good and the highlight of the meal.   I got the eggs scrambled.  They were cold and soupy. The bacon was thick cut (yay!!) but was also cold and undercooked.   This breakfast was just \"ok\" and very disappointing. I'm sure that there are better spots to go to and I won't be going back."}
{"text":"Was expecting more. Last time we went the portion size was better.  Disappointed in the quantity. Not a cheap eat anymore. Food was OK quality. Not a bad breakfast joint."}
{"text":"Our Friday mid morning \"15-20 minute\" wait turned into a half hour.  Unlike First Watch their waiting area offers no coffee.  Once seated it took another 25 minutes to be served our food.  This while the restaurant had plenty of empty tables.   They don't leave a pot of coffee on the table, you have to flag down the server.  There no Splenda on the table, you have to ask for it.  Our omelets were overcooked and dry.  We won't be going back."}
{"text":"Me and my boys were looking for a good place to eat around rocky river and we did not get it. The Mexican omelette looked like a hot pocket, the Mexican burrito was rather confusing, and the corned beef hash was purple. The coffee wasn't even very good. I didn't enjoy the art on the walls or the music. The pancakes were nice though. Get those if you want some good food. Spent a disturbing $17. Should've went to chipotle."}
{"text":"I had breakfast here several times recently.  We tended to go early in the morning and got good service.  Omlettes and pancakes were excellent.  I definitely never left hungry."}
{"text":"The best pumpkin pancakes since the ones I had at the amazing Dor-Stop in Dormont a few years ago, and that's saying something!! They were so good, that I really didn't need much syrup, and I usually bury them in syrup!  good stuff!  Speaking of syrup, they have a tropical syrup that is awesome, but it just wasn't quite right with this combination.    So the pancakes were awesome, the ham was OK, but it was a thick slice of lunch meat which unfortunately, has become the norm these days, it was prepared OK, and tested pretty good, but I really like the real thing that isn't processed, and based on the pictures I saw on yelp, that's what I thought I was going to get.  It was OK, but nothing to get excited about like the ham you get at De Luca's for example.    Service was quick and friendly, and you need to know that it seemed like all the pancakes and waffles come ala' carte, so if you like sausage or ham or bacon, it's going to get a little pricey.    If I go back, I would get the pumpkin pancakes again, but I would skip the ham at $4.25 for a side item."}
{"text":"This was the first and only time I will ever go to this \"restaurant\".  First they treat you like kinda snotty, she told me there would be a 15 min. wait when I could clearly see there were many empty tables. Then our waitress was horrible, trying to make her understand was tough, I had a Entertainment book coupon.  I ordered a hamburger for the one meal and a reuben for me.  I needed to order two drinks, so I order a chocolate milk for my son, she was giving me a hard time because of the other kids, she was like if you order a 3rd kids drink you will have to pay for it.  I told her I needed to order 2 regular drinks to use the coupon so she brings the regular chocolate milk in a kids cup. No refill.  Now I had to pay for a large chocolate milk but he only got a kid size cup amount. First problem.  Then she says they are out of hamburgers at 12:45 on a thursday, after talking him into something else because he doesn't eat many things, she comes back and says they thawed out a hamburger!!  It was dry, my reuben was one of the worst I've ever eaten, a few strands of sour kraut, the swiss cheese has to be so thin you couldn't taste it and the corn beef was so dry it was chokeable. The potato pancake were paper thin and tasteless.  Second problem.  Our waitress disappeared, so trying to get a pop refill was beyond difficult. Third problem.  The pancake the girls got weren't so great that it made up for the rest, I will never go back I can't understand why people go there.  Bad service, Bad food."}
{"text":"Went here on Sunday morning for breakfast while in Cleveland.  Was about a 30 minute wait which for a Sunday morning wasn't too bad.  I ordered bacon wrap which was delicious.  My husband decided to try the Dutch apple pancakes, because they oven bake them took about 15 minutes to get them but they were well worth the wait.  Service was exceptional considering how busy they were.  Will definitely come back if I am in the area again"}
{"text":"I'm a little late writing this review, but nevertheless I love pancake house!!!! I used to go to the location near piedmont in Atlanta every Sunday with my mom, so I was elated when I found this one 2 weeks ago. I was a little skeptical about going after reading some of the reviews on here, but I must say The Original Pancake House wins again. My niece loved her chocolate chip pancakes and bacon and I enjoyed every bite of my strawberry pancakes with the outrageously delicious whipped cream and turkey links and eggs. My waitress was very sweet and attentive even though it was super crowded on a Sunday, which I wasn't surprised about. I do hate other people have gone and haven't enjoyed this place like me, but if you want a relaxed atmosphere and great food then this is definitely the place!"}
{"text":"It was sooooo goood, their cinnamon raisin pancakes are to die for , along with thier biscuits and gravy"}
{"text":"I visited the OHOP on Chagrin Blvd in  Woodmere and I was very disappointed. The food was ok, however the restaurant day manager decided to seat all of the African American patrons in the back of the restaurant with the African American servers and all of the Caucasian patrons in the front with the Caucasian servers. My husband and I didn't notice this until mid way through our meal as our section was filled with African Americans and they began to notice and complain also. It's a shame that this occurred, we where very disappointed. I spoke with the Manager and he stated the seating was because people request certain servers. That made NO sense at all because we did NOT request a certain server. That was straight BS. I will be making a formal complaint to the Owners and I will NOT be patronizing OHOP ever again. You just lost a customer and I will tell EVERYONE I know about this experience."}
{"text":"This is an excellent choice or breakfast/brunch!!!  The food is dripping with flavor and comes in large portions. The apple waffle will change your life! Trust me!!  The omelettes are huge!! The pancakes and waffles can come with a variety of toppings. They also have great crepes with different toppings.  But if you want to try something new, go for the potato pancakes!  I know it sounds strange but you'll be pleasantly surprised.  The service here is consistently awesome, they are always happy to assist.  And they have a great military discount for active duty, just show your id. This place is located inside of Aliante casino hotel."}
{"text":"We have been going here when friends and family visit for years. Today took parents, who were thrilled to see the options for Pumpkin, Gingerbread, or Red Velvet pancakes. We asked the waitress about the prices on this since they don't put the prices on their signs or in the menu (leaving the impression these are just optional flavor choices when you get pancakes). Turns out it is a $2.50 surcharge to \"enhance\" your free 3 pancakes (with egg orders) with these optional flavors. We wanted to try 2 flavors, so the waitress suggested we buy a \"full stack\" which has 8 pancakes so we could get 4 of each for $8.99. We said great. Later they bring the bill and have charged us $14.00 for the 8 pancakes!! We ask the waitress and she said \"sorry, but I had the price wrong\" and walked away....we asked her to come back and she said she guessed she could talk to the manager but she didn't think he would fix it. Next thing we know the manager comes over and says the waitress said we wanted to speak to him and acted like he had no idea what it was about. We explained and he says, \"yeah, we don't allow special flavored pancakes on the full stack, and I have told this to your waitress.\" We said this is not what we were told so we want to pay what we were told, and he said he would have to confirm this situation with the waitress. Then, the waitress comes back and says the manager wanted us to know he would not adjust our price, and she said she was sorry but she figured he wouldn't do it.  SERIOUSLY!!  They lie to us about the price and they play the blame game back and forth between each other until ultimately telling us to eat their mistake anyhow. Incredibly rude and treated us like we were asking for a favor. Horrible, I have never seen a more inept manager in some time.....good luck with your experience."}
{"text":"Honestly, the best breakfast in Pittsburgh. They use the best ingredients and the food is delicious.   They are always sending out good coupons in the mail. Their Monday thru Friday specials are quite the deal. The pancakes are amazing and the service superb."}
{"text":"The food was just ok for the exorbitant prices. The waitress was very sweet, but the host and the guy working the register were terribly unfriendly. I will not return. There are much better places to get breakfast."}
{"text":"Great pancakess - light and fluffy, not too filling. Hubby had strawberry french toast, also delicious. Visiting from Georgia...highly recommend. Found thisnplace and came due to Yelp reviewers positive comments. Great choice!"}
{"text":"Seated immediately on a Saturday around 2:30pm. Our waitress was fantastic and so adorable (Diane). She explained everything and answered questions we didn't even know we should ask. The food did take a while but was good and hot when it was brought out. There were about four tables still dining when one of the workers brought out the vacuum and started sweeping right by our tables. Their hours said they closed at 3, and it was right around then that the cleanup started. It made us feel rushed and uncomfortable. There was also some strange sound coming from the kitchen like someone was hawking lougies. We heard it ~15 times during our meal. Pretty unappetizing."}
{"text":"Stopped in on our way out of the city. Waited 15 or so minutes, while other patrons that came in before AND after us all got seated. We inquired and was told that our name was already crossed off, and was told that we were already seated! No explanation or apology was given.  Food was just okay... Coffee was watered down.. Not a pleasant stop before we left the pleasant city."}
{"text":"Best pancakes...PERIOD!!! Make sure to ask for Diana. She knows her stuff. Very informative!! Even when it's busy, she is on top of everything. OPH's Wonder Woman! Be sure to try the Mexican omelet with fresh strawberry pancakes."}
{"text":"This location is in Green Valley Ranch hotel & casino.  Love the breakfast food here! My favorites... the crapes & the omelettes.  Oh! & the pancakes of course.  Super yummy!! Great atmosphere.  Sometimes it can get a little too busy at times & the wait may take awhile.  Other than that, great food, good prices!"}
{"text":"This place might be the most child-friendly restaurant I've been to.  Not only do they have changing tables in both the men's and women's restrooms, but they also have stools by the sink so your kid can reach to wash their hands without you trying to hold them.  It's also quite loud, which allows families with loud children to not feel guilty when their kids scream."}
{"text":"Worth. The. Wait. The food is fantastic, the menu is huge (but not in an overwhelming way) and the service was attentive. I went with a few friends on Sunday, and we waited about 45 minutes - not terrible. The table turnover was pretty quick (but not like they are hurrying you out of the restaurant). I got the Mexican Benedict, which was amazing - and it came with a side of pancakes! Honestly, that is what sold me on the meal because I was gonna get the seafood crepe, but there was not a side of pancakes with that meal (maybe next time I will get that). The portions are way too big, but they are delicious and great for leftovers for later (which is exactly what I did!). Can't wait to try the one on the Westside by my work."}
{"text":"The food and coffee were great but the wait staff was really rude. I think I'll actually not be coming back because of it. She cleared our plates without asking (and before some people were finished), came to ask if we needed more coffee (but she obviously was telling to please leave) about every minute after she cleared our table too early, and when we asked if we could split the check between the two couple she got annoyed and said we should've told her before we sat down. These aren't egregious things, sure, but they certainly aren't things that make me want to drive all the way down McKnight road."}
{"text":"Like IHOP but with less of a stale, factory feeling. And with better eggs.  Since all egg dishes come with 3 (smallish) pancakes, I thought I'd get the best of both worlds and order a Western Omelette. Um, this omelette was HUGE. It tasted great, which was a total surprise. The pancakes were delicious and I loved the syrup.   I also appreciate the way the menu is not 10 pages long. I think it just has a front and a back. But they still have plenty of options and the decision was just as difficult. It's just that I don't want to have to sift through hundreds of descriptions of entrees and see fake photos of open-faced turkey sandwiches and shrimp scampi (again, this is where IHOP fails and Original Pancake House wins).  Great service, actually decent coffee, and a good place to take the kids (they are all screaming, so your kid's noise is drowned out for once). Will return!"}
{"text":"Drove 30 min to go here, we're from out of town and Manager (some iraquí looking guy) proudly told us \"sorry we're close\" 6 minutes after 3:00pm. You can tell he don't give a crap about customers.."}
{"text":"Pancakes are top notch.  Eggs are hit and miss.  French toast was poor - waayyyy too much egg batter.....felt like I was eating scrambled egg toast.  Service is decent to good.  Some are better than others.  I need to try the waffle soon."}
{"text":"The first New Yorker to review!!  Fantastic service and delicious pancakes. Wide range of choices to put in your pancakes.  I recommend the Bacon Pancakes for the experience and nothing else.  The chocolate chip pancakes are decadent."}
{"text":"This Original Pancake House easily had the best service of any I've ever been to.  Our waitress was so sweet, I almost wanted to ask her to sit down and join us!  All of the Pancake House specialties are enormous portions and could easily be shared by two people. I don't usually feel like sharing though, but it's always nice to have some to take home.  If you want a filling Breakfast experience, OPH is a great place to go.  Admittedly, as others have mentioned, the downside is the wait.  Since the food is \"made to order\" it can take considerable time for your meal to arrive.  If you are hungry to eat NOW, beware."}
{"text":"If you have a lot of hungry mouthes to feed this is your place.  Huge portions with excellent flavors. The banana foster french toast is a winner.   If you like eggs benedict i highly recommend them.  The omlettes are quite large and look like an upside down pie pan.  The three times i have been there i have not been disappointed, but like most breakfast joints if you dont like your homefries raw ask for them to be well done."}
{"text":"Another \"great\" restaurant inside Aliante Station.  I gave them an extra star for the perky staff. But that's it.   I tried the potato pancakes. You get a ton of them! Too bad they tasted like lemon and vinegar. I took  two bites out of a plate that was LITERALLY overflowing with pancakes. I tried telling the server that something was wrong because they tasted terrible and she insisted that the vinegar-lemon taste was the German recipe.  Now, I've never waited tables before. But it's common sense to me that if a fat lady orders a giant platter of potatoes and takes literally two small bites, she didn't like it and it should have been removed from the bill. But that's just me. Those who can't do, teach. Right?  Won't be back. Nope."}
{"text":"The staff was very friendly and inviting. The French toast was delightful and my friend said that the bacon pancakes were awesome."}
{"text":"Way overpriced for a casino coffeeshop. Value is simply not there. Servers are very pleasant and efficient. But with all the choices in Las Vegas, there should never be a reason why someone sould pay $30-$40 dollars for two people to have breakfast."}
{"text":"We loved this place!!  We ate here in Decemeber and saw that we could get a restaurant.com gc, so we thought why not.  Our memory is that the place was a crowded IHOP wanna be but the food was good.  This time we loved the location, food and decor.  It was so much more relaxing and pleasant than our first visit.    I had the strawberry pancakes, hubby had the apple cinnamon pancakes and we shared a side of bacon.  Everything was delicious.  The standout was the side of bacon coming in  around $5 and worth every cent.   I still dream of the bacon...."}
{"text":"Gluten free options here! You feel welcome with a food allergy, not like a nuisance.  Delicious!!!"}
{"text":"You have to try the bacon! Thick cut and delicious. Fantastic pancakes and home fries. I will be back!"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I went found the Original Pancake house on Yelp. We went on a Sunday around 11:00am. We got there and it was packed. The wait was about 30 minutes and they meant every minute of that 30 minutes. Once seated, we were immediately greeted, offered drinks and then we ordered. Our food came out right away. Be aware everything is a la carte, which was fine for us. Yet they give so much food. I ordered grits, bacon, 1 egg and a strawberry waffle. It was way too much food. They have me 6 thick pieces of bacon. If we would have known, we would have shared because my boyfriend ordered bacon too. Just a lesson learned. I'm in Cleveland a couple times a year because I have family there. I usually don't eat out since my family cooks. But if I ever get the chance to eat out for breakfast again, I'm going to try this place again. I liked it and the service."}
{"text":"Came here with relatives on a Saturday morning. As I open the door, you can sense the hustle and buzz of people coming in and out. This usually makes me excited and tells me, this place must be a local favorite.  As I peruse the menu, I see something called \"dutch baby\" and decide to try it. It is still a pancake, but it is treated with lemon slices, that you squeeze for the juice and powdered sugar. Like the pics and my review if you like powdered sugar!   It was a unique looking pancake and tasted delicious, something I would order again."}
{"text":"It is fall ... guess what is coming back. ... PUMPKIN PANCAKES ... refuse the whipped cream. . No butter needed ... just experience the cinnamon and pumpkin ... just salivating writing about it.  Take a friend to share your side of hashbrowns/fried potatoes ...  There is usually a wait because you are not rushed to eat and leave."}
{"text":"Place is good, not great!  I'm not too impressed by it, but I definitely  frequent it because of the extensive menu, solid service, and prettty good quality of food.  It is basically an upscale version of IHOP.  I'd recommend it, but you wont fall in love."}
{"text":"I've been a few times now and the food is always really good. The service is very nice, but a little slow. I believe our waitress took advantage of the fact that we were younger, chill customers and chose to ignore us during a very busy time because of it. We waited 30+ minutes before she came back to our table for our check. But she was a very kind women, and I understand the struggle of a rush on a Saturday morning, so I won't hold it against her. I'll go again."}
{"text":"I am in love with their German pancake! My fiance thinks it is over rated, but it is just mind blowing for me. I am a fan of thin pancakes (like crepes), which is why I love these. And Original Pancake House is the only breakfast place that has them.... that I have gone to.   Their waffles are wonderful too!   I love this place so much that after i did my first half marathon, as sore as I was, I came down here to have a big meal to reward myself!!! It was totally worth it as I limped away from the restaurant  Service here is great and location is good."}
{"text":"So the food was AWESOME. I'll give it that, the staff was seriously creepy. The girl who waited on us clearly had a thing for my boyfriend and it was slightly annoying and she just had a weird blank stare the whole time. The whole staff bussing tables looked like they were on downers. I seriously felt like I was in the twilight zone. After this we go to check out and the young.. annoying girl at the front kept asking if I wanted a bag. I said no about 6 times.. Then she kept asking if we were taking bacon home? Wtf... no.. who cares if we are? I was so turned off by this place because of the weird staff. I'd go back for the food for sure but.. maybe carry out if they have this?"}
{"text":"They make gluten free pancakes. All you have to do is ask."}
{"text":"Food was great but the restaurant was noisy. Hard to have a conversation with the acoustics in the place but I'm willing to forgo for the breakfast choices."}
{"text":"This is the place we bring my in-laws whenever they visit for a welcome-to-town-breakfast. It's a great place for anyone, including families to go. The atmosphere is much like an IHOP, but much better!  We've always had fairly good service here, and the food is solid. There breakfast potatoes are amazing - I always get a side of those because they are simply to good to pass up! I tend to gravitate towards sweeter good when going out for breakfast, so I can definitely say their crepes are amazing!   For those savory lovers out there my wife absolutely adores their eggs and says their bacon is some of the best (it's very crispy!). The portion sizes are quite generous as well, which is always nice! TOPH won't be blowing any socks off, but it is a nice restaurant with decent food and reasonable service for the price."}
{"text":"Its pretty dang good. Great pancakes, great waffles, and great omelets. The only thing I'm not to crazy about is the hot chocolate... way to chocolaty. So bottom line... clean , nice, cosy, tasty, and good for the family."}
{"text":"It doesn't look like much from the street (it is in a strip mall across from Eton) but once you step into the dining room, it feels boutiquey. The walls are covered by colorful original, interesting paintings. The dining room is sunny and airy.   The orange juice is freshly squeezed and just like I remember from Greece.   I indulged in the meat lovers. I asked my dining partner not to judge me.   They make gluten free pancakes if you ask."}
{"text":"I love their food but their wait is usually pretty long. Some items on the menu are pretty pricey but it all depends on what you want, the pancakes are pretty inexpensive. The waiters and waitresses could be a bit more attentive but it is not too bad. I enjoy going every once in a while!"}
{"text":"No complaints. Some of the best bacon around. Huge bacon. Crisply cooked.   Delicious pancakes and plenty of options in the lineup. I had some with pecans and something else. Just super, folks. Super stuff.   The corned beef hash was a solid B. I've had better and much worse.   I'll go back here for the bacon."}
{"text":"Wait an hour for bad service and pancakes that don't even taste as good as what I can make out of the box at home? Add in some pretty horrible wait staff and I think I'll pass next time."}
{"text":"I didn't have high hopes for the Original Pancake House but I was pleasantly surprised.  The bacon pancakes were spectacular and I loved the thick, crisp slices of bacon.  Be prepared to wait on weekends, however."}
{"text":"Pros: food was great, portions were big, staff was very nice, coffee was hot and plentiful :-) I had the banana pancakes with bacon and eggs. My husband had the apple cinnamon pancakes with bacon and eggs. Both dishes were delicious. We didn't have to wait long for our food either. We both didn't care for the tropical syrup.   Cons: parking.... this was a big one for me. The lot is really small. It is difficult to get in and out of the lot when the restaurant is busy. This might actually prevent me from returning often.    Definitely a place to go but maybe only during less crowded hours."}
{"text":"Everything was amazing! Excellent service and food. Order the Dutch Baby and anything with bacon."}
{"text":"We had an awful experience at OPH in Fairview Park.  Two members of our party (both vegetarian) ordered a special wrap.  After biting into it they realized they had eaten sausage.  Turns out, there was an error on the specials print out and whoever created it left off \"sausage.\" More importantly, when the people told the waitress this, she looked confused and rather than apologizing she said, \"Oh is that a problem? Do you not like sausage?\"  I was told I could not order my gluten free pancakes a specific way, even though I've done it in the past and the menu said I could!   Finally, the service as slow -- no refills on coffee or water.  Normally, I'm a big fan of OPH, but not this location."}
{"text":"We shared the apple pancakes and they were delicious! The pancake was like custard because it was baked. The apples were amazing! The dish was big enough for two easily!  The large orange juice that was supposed to be a large...was over $4!!! I get it, freshed squeezed, blah blah blah. Oranges are in season and it does not cost 1/16 of that to fill a not so large glass! Rip off! I will still go back when staying at the GVR but won't be ordering OJ :)"}
{"text":"This place was good but has gone downhill. The last two times I went, the serving sizes decreased. They used to be well known for their big omelette's but they aren't so big anymore and now their waffles are about the size of Eggo's. Since that was the main thing they had going for them, it's a big problem. The service is always kind of odd. They absolutely cannot handle a giant serving dish with multiple things on it as they prefer to bring things by hand. Don't expect your food to come all at one time, because it won't.  Other problems: - If you want anything more than eggs, pancakes or toast, prepare to pay a ton for it and prepare for lots of questions from the staff. I like to bring stuff home to eat and they consistently make me feel awful for it. They love to throw in snide remarks with the one saying \"I guess your eyes were bigger than your stomach\". She found out that her mouth was bigger than her tip. - Want a full size breakfast kielbasa? Not happening. Want a half size one? $7. - $8 Waffles. Yes, $8 Waffles. You can buy the waffle mix for half that price."}
{"text":"Great pancakes, if you are into that sort of thing. Me likey."}
{"text":"Hadn't been here in a couple of years and wanted some pancakes. Came around 1:30pm on a Saturday and had a 10 minute wait. It took several minutes for a server to come and take our drink order. Service after was ok. I had the pecan pancakes and they were decent, nothing to write home about. The egg breakfast with potatoes looked pretty unappetizing - not something I'd want to eat. I don't think I'll be back."}
{"text":"Probably our go to place for breakfast.  Place is packed.  Almost always consistent.  Last time my hash browns weren't warmed through.  Prices are reasonable.  Servers are mostly good.."}
{"text":"this is my favorite place for breakfast.  i have never been disappointed.  the very best crepes, blueberry pancakes and strawberry waffles to die for.  the best bacon and cooked perfectly."}
{"text":"To be fair, I ordered a sandwich instead of pancakes - BIG MISTAKE. I have visited the location in Aliso Viejo and thoroughly enjoyed chocolate chip & banana pancakes.   Anyway, I ordered the Chicken Melt and added avocado (so not enough to be worth the extra $1.89). The chicken was okay but not as moist as it should have been and there was something off about the seasoning. It comes on a french roll - that was a bit too much bread - with tomato (which still had that top part that attaches to the vine on it) and a lot of lettuce (which was mostly brown). The french fries were adequate although some were more salted than others and the portion was amazingly small.  My husband had the Cinnamon Raisin Pancakes that he said were \"quite nice\".   If we return - which is possible since Aliante keeps sending me coupons (wonder why that is???) - I will definitely stick with the pancakes."}
{"text":"I went to TOPH on a late Sunday morning with a fairly large group. We had to wait about 30-40 minutes to be seated, though it was all worth it when we got our food. If you do decide to eat here, I recommend the pancakes (hence the name). I was amazed at all of the unique pancakes. I ended up sticking with the traditional buttermilk pancakes, which were fluffy, buttery, and melted in your mouth. My friend got the s'mores, however, which was adorned with mini marshmallows, chocolate syrup, and turned out to be equally delicious. The wait for the food was also a little long, however our waitress was very kind and friendly and kept checking in on us and refilling our drinks. The interior is nice, not very special, and easy on the eyes. It was a little loud, however, I loved it and can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"It never disappoints. Although I have tried their baked omelets, which I love, I have been stuck on the potato pancakes, whose like I have not seen elsewhere in town.  Great food and outstanding service earns this joint a 5"}
{"text":"Remember me ?  Your loyal customer.  The one who has NEVER squawked at paying 5 bucks for 5 strips of bacon, 10 bucks for a Dutch Baby or even 2.59 for a cup of diet Pepsi.  Big picture, it's a great treat & worth the drive.  This morning I'm greeted with, \"the owners no longer allow free refills on soda\".  Seriously ?  The coffee & water drinkers go full tilt but now overcharged soda drinkers are 2nd rate?  Granted I'm off work due to sub-zero temps and perhaps a tad crabby due to the chill in the air.  I get profit.  I get being in business (I'm a business owner too).  For $ 2.59 I can buy a 12 pack of cans on sale.  You're telling me that you're losing so much money on SODA that you're willing to lose my business ?  This is a bad decision.  Yeah, yeah....3 stars based on food.  Minus two for starting my day with an F.U.  Perhaps a suggestion to refocus on us....your customer.  Big picture."}
{"text":"For starters, the restaurant is incredibly large, so don't be afraid to bring a group. My husband and I have never once had slow or bad service. All of the staff really help each other out and are sure to make your dining experience a good one. It's nice when you're at breakfast and your coffee doesn't get cold bc they're always quick to refill it. The dress is casual. I have tried (and LOVED) the spinach eggs Benedict, the blueberry pancakes, the breakfast crepes, and the corned beef hash. I hope you enjoy this place as much as we do."}
{"text":"My waffle was huge, as in height. Was very hard to chew. The waitress was slow. Very odd feeling in that place. Don't. Like it."}
{"text":"Always good breakfest food here......never disappointed. The staff is nice and I've never had a wait time longer than 5 mins to be seated. I usually go for the pancakes which are excellent but if you order an omelette you get a stack of pancakes with that come with that order. Wish the scrambled eggs were better and larger but overall this is a cool place to eat on a Sat morning when I usually go. Check it out if you are in the area."}
{"text":"The food is great but, the service is average at best at this location.  Timing is of the essence here as you can experience a really long wait at times.  The buttermilk pancakes are out of this world! The homemade syrup is great too. A short stack is three pancakes and a full stack is six pancakes. A short stack is more than enough for the average person.  They give you a huge portions of everything. Their fresh squeezed orange juice is something special but, at $4 a glass is pretty steep. I can buy a whole bottle of Simply Orange for that!  The service is what needs the help. The servers seem like they don't want to be there. Once you receive your food make sure you have everything you need before they walk away. You have to hunt them down if you need something or for refills.  F.Y.I. Call ahead to make sure they're open as they're not open daily."}
{"text":"This Original Pancake House offers a much smaller menu than at the other locations I've been to, but the food is still solid. Plus it is nice to have an anytime breakfast option in a casino.  I went with the spinach crepe, and it was done well. It was smothered in hollandaisae sauce and featured an appearance by mushrooms and onions. Came with a side of potato pancakes, something I haven't had in years. Very light and fluffy, and while I was really in the mood for hash browns, they served as a fine substitute.  The waitress was friendly and attentive, and while the place was a little crowded and noisy, it served its purpose well."}
{"text":"Service is terrible! I waited 10 minutes for my good AFTER the rest of my table was eating. The manager did not show any concern or seem to have any sense of urgency in fixing the issues. I will never be returning. Plenty of more options for breakfast in the area with much better service. I wish I could get be this place 0 stars."}
{"text":"I'm not a fan of pancakes but my daughter wanted them. That being said, she enjoyed them. They give three good sized pancakes for the kids. I had the German potatoes, which were pretty good. They have paprika or similar spice on them. The food came out fast. The coffee was good and come in cute mugs. I'm not sure if I would come again, but if you like pancakes, it is worth a try."}
{"text":"OMG!   This place is delicious! IHOP who?! The buttermilk pancakes are out of this world! The homemade syrup is as well. A short stack is three pancakes and a full stack is six pancakes. A short stack is more than enough for the average person.  They give you a huge portion of corn beef harsh. It's pretty good but, not as good as Pamela's.  Their fresh squeezed orange juice is something special as well but at $4 a glass is pretty steep. I can buy a whole bottle of Simply Orange for that!  My wife had a Reuben and a cup of Wedding Soup. The Wedding Soup was the best we have ever had but it had no noodles. Huh?  A must try place! Get there early as they close at 3 pm."}
{"text":"I'm generally only in Cleveland about 4 weeks out of the year: two weeks for winter break and two weeks for summer break. However, the past three trips I've made, I have found the time to go to The Original Pancake House.   There seems to be a bit of a wait if you decide to go during a morning on the weekend. It isn't too terrible though, and definitely worth it!   Thankfully I don't live closer, or I would eat here for breakfast all the time and gain 50 lbs. The Pancakes are pretty good, not gonna lie. But the omelets are also amazing, not to mention huge! The last two times I went here I ordered the mexican omelet. T'was good. I had to bring some of it home in a doggie bag.  The service was alright. Nothing amazing. I would definitely check it out."}
{"text":"My cousin bought me here and I love this place.  I had wanted to try a new pancake so I picked the Coconut Pancakes with the Tropical Syrup.  The waitress gave me maple syrup just in case I did not like the Tropical Syrup.  But that Tropical Syrup was so OMG tasty on my pancakes.  The host, waitress and cook was very attentive and friendly."}
{"text":"Absolutely love this place! Each time I visit, I am seated promptly and given so many options. Ask for Diane as your server, you won't regret it! She explains where all the food comes from and how it's made. She is just a ball of sunshine!!! Be sure to bring your appetite, the portions are huge!"}
{"text":"I highly recommend this restaurant for breakfast or brunch! The food is wonderful and they have a large variety of pancakes to choose from (blueberry is my favorite) and they have many other great breakfast items including omelets that are HUGE & delicious. They have sandwiches and lunch items as well. The prices are fair and the food is fresh. One negative is parking, which is very limited, but I would highly recommend this restaurant for a great meal."}
{"text":"Excellent.  Always come for the Dutch Baby which is amazing.  I love their bacon which is thick and crispy. Eggs are always light and flavorful."}
{"text":"This location is now closed.  GVR is looking to bring back their cafe.  I hope they leave the booths alone.  They are the most comfortable it has ever been my pleasure to sit in."}
{"text":"This place is just ok for breakfast.  The food is mostly mediocre and the service is so-so.  The entire reason to go here for breakfast is if you have a business meeting.  It's like the restaurant was setup for breakfast meetings to happen.  Also, if you are a coffee lover, your glass will never go empty.  If you like anything other than coffee, good luck getting a second look from anybody."}
{"text":"OMG!!! Like really OM friggin' G!!!!  I wanted something quick to eat before going to an appointment.  It was between this place and Chick-fil-A...I had a crazy craving for pancakes so OPH it is!  Super clean place, didn't look dingy at all.  Was happily greeted and seated quickly in a pretty packed place (my timing was perfect because people started to pour in the lobby).  Looking at the menu, there were a lot of good things to choose from that I really wanted to try, but I only had enough time to chow down on pancakes and didn't really want to have that breakfast smell linger on me lol.  My server was super nice and quick (people like that are very rare especially when it is super busy).  I was a little reserved about the pancakes (thought it was going to have a meh taste) but when I cut my little triangle (lol) and shoved it into my mouth...wow!!!! Now I didn't even put syrup on the pancakes but it's sweet...not too sweet but it had a very nice flavor...now I don't know if it was sugar or vanilla (I'm bad with that stuff) but I really thought it was really really good!  Adding syrup is like an added bonus!  I will definitely come back here to try the other menu items (trust me, there were a lot of appealing things to choose from).  My only mistake is that I didn't know I could have ordered a small stack...I wasted like three pancakes (five total I think) that was huge and I couldn't eat it all.  Even my server felt bad because I wasted the pancakes lol."}
{"text":"Pleasant surprises galore...Arrived in the middle of a rush, was fortunate enough to grab the last parking spot.  Walking in, we were immediately seated.   I ordered (2) 49er style pancakes, my girlfriend ordered the apple cinnamon pancakes.  They were brought out within what seemed like less than 5 minutes. The 49er pancakes were described on the menu something along the lines of soft, chewy, as big as your plate.   The plates looked spectacular. The apples were sauteed al dente, the 49er pancakes surpassed expectations. When they arrived, they took were about 7/8 the size of the plate. In a moment of gluttony, I basically inhaled the 49er cakes, sans syrup.  Perfect taste and texture. It literally took me 3 minutes to crush them. A couple minutes later, the manager came over with another one, saying it looked like I was a little slighted. Thought that was awesome, great move even though I didn't feel remotely slighted. Well played gesture indeed.  It's nearly impossible to beat a Pamela's pancake, but The Original Pancake House now has a new loyal. I'm telling you, the 49er pancake is worth its weight in, well, you know."}
{"text":"OH. MY. GOD.  Next time I take a flight that requires a layover, I'm going to try to have it be in Cleveland so I can quickly rent a car and drive out to the Original Pancake House.  I have only eaten here once, so maybe 5 stars isn't justified, but screw it.  The food was damned good.  My southern pecan waffle was perfect in every way--huge, golden brown, slight crisp, fluffy, topped with toasty, crunchy pecans.  The side of turkey sausage had my toes curled.  To be honest, I can't tell you what my boyfriend ate because it was gone so fast.  While the atmosphere in this place is kind of chain-y, it has the homey feel of great service, local artists' paintings for sale on the wall, and their custom pancake mix for sale.  OPH puts Cleveland on the map of my heart."}
{"text":"Service was slow when there should be enough staff for a full restaurant. Pancakes were awful and clearly not mixed well"}
{"text":"What economic slowdown? What recession?  This place was packed last Friday and I thought, coming from the Bay Area, that Las Vegas/Henderson was slower than San Francisco.  Wrong!  And I doubt that these people were going to the Rebel game the next day at the Silver Bowl.  Yes, the pancakes still take a while to get to the table, but excellent as always.  Service was quick and attentive.  The server and his manager were quick with coffee refills.  Yes, there were lots of families at this location.  Even the older folk were cramped into OPH.  A nice young couple gave me, the solo, tourist diner, a coupon good for 20% before I paid my bill.  Who says the residents of Henderson are rude and aloof?  Me thinks not (As an undergraduate years ago, I lived in Henderson, \"Of Course!\")  I shall return to the OPH on this side of the Mississippi!  Kudos to the staff (and the yuppie couple)."}
{"text":"The food today was good... Not its usual 5 start greatness. Our omelets were wonderful but the home fries were not edible. What truly was worse was our server, Laura, she was so indifferent that it kind of turned me off. She was not friendly, she seemed bothered that we needed more butter and syrup and we really put her off when we needed drinks. I realize it was a holiday and busy but when you take a job as a waitress you have to rise above whatever is going on and put a smile on your face. You should make your table feel welcome and not like a burden. Esp. When they are spending large amounts of money.  I cannot say I will not come back but I will certainly ask not to sit in Laura's section."}
{"text":"The absolute go to breakfast spot in Pepper Pike!  Just the aroma of that wonderful maple smiles thick slab bacon gets me every time.  There is never a time we have visitors that we don't introduce them To the famous apple pancake.  Here's a secret.....  I always ask if I can start a cup of coffee while waiting on the benches.  So good I just can't wait"}
{"text":"What a treat! Love buckwheat pancakes and these are yummy. Real maple syrup and butter! Yes! Atmosphere clean and cheery, complimented by staff who represent the same qualities. They also had turkey sausage! I have to avoid pork so this was a special treat! Be advised the casing is pork on the sausage but I just remove it.  The Greek omelet is baked like their apple pancake. The omelet was delish. The apple pancake at the table next to us looked incredible and disappeared quickly."}
{"text":"The Pancake house is located inside GVR. I wish they would have kept the Cafe it was so much better then this spot! Got the eggs,pancakes, and bacon. The eggs were mushy and had no flavor, the bacon was falling apart in pieces because it was so overcooked but the pancakes were decent. The service was good though. I might be back to try the lunch menu"}
{"text":"I've been to other Original Pancake House locations, but for some reason the one inside the Green Valley Ranch Casino was better.  Maybe it was the excitement of the casino and family from out of town, but we had a great experience.  The service was great, and my family now say it's going to be a tradition to go there for breakfast, when ever they come to visit me in town.    The Blueberry Crepes is a must order...Delish!!!"}
{"text":"Don't misinterpret my 3 star review as calling this place terrible; this place isn't half bad. However, I hesitant to give this place more than 3 stars mainly because of the service, the price, and the quality of the food.   Our waitress was nice, but slammed our water and coffee down and seemed a bit stressed when she took our orders. She was quick to correct a wrong order which was nice though.   I definitely feel that we paid too much for our food. To get a side of sausage or bacon is $5. All the eggs come with a side of plain pancakes which can be substituted for any other type, but they weren't even that good for being from a place called the original pancake house. We each paid more than $15 for basic breakfast meals. Its not that I mind paying that much. I've paid more for a delicious breakfast. But the quality of the food didn't match up with the price. My pancakes tasted too doughy. My friends almond French toast tasted burnt and wasn't too impressive. I've had better fried eggs and corned beef at other brunch places.   I wouldn't call this place terrible. It's good food and we had a nice time. But I personally won't be going back."}
{"text":"Unfortunately we will no longer be going to the Pancake House. This morning we went for breakfast. My husband wanted to order a few things a la Carte as they didn't have exactly what he wanted. Our section was about half full and it was not super busy. The waitress charged us for 3 meals rather than 1 meal and the a la Carte items. We pointed out the math to her and she said she'd be right back. She never came back. She waited on other tables and ignored us. 20 minutes later when she came back she handed us a new check. Or what we thought was a corrected check.   When we got to the register, it was the exactly same check (after she told us she would adjust it). At the register we asked to speak to the manager and we waited for another 20 minutes but no manager appeared. We had spent enough time waiting at the Pancake House.  We were tired of waiting and ended up paying and leaving. At that point, we just wanted to go home. Customer service seems like a very low priority. We were really disappointed with this experience."}
{"text":"This was the best breakfast I ever had.  That is not an exaggeration...I really mean it.  I had a western omelette with a side of bacon.  The omelette comes with pancakes.  It was a 6 EGG OMELETTE!  The bacon was really thick!  About 3/16\" thick.  The pancakes even though they were just buttermilk were awesome.  Wish I lived closer so I could try more things."}
{"text":"This new Original Pancake House is a really cool addition to the brand new Aliante Casino. On the day after Christmas, we were actually looking for Krispy Kreme which we found out recently closed.  So here we were wanting some carbs with  the Original Pancake House open.  It was an excellent choice.  At 7:30 AM, there was no line but by 8:15 when we left, it was getting full and lively. Lots of families spent Christmas day in the hotel for a reunion and descended into OPH before heading back home - probably with fewer dollars less in their pockets. The place was brand spanking new, very clean, bright, and overall comfortable.  We had a terrific waitress; cheerful, well spoken, and polite saying sorry when she interrupted our conversation to take our order, if all was well, to ask if we wanted coffee refills, to take dirty plates, etc. What I've found is that overall, the northern North Las Vegas employees are a little more polite and cheerful that their Southern California counterparts. Either NLV workers are the better actors or they're smarter knowing how service can break a fragile economy.  I ordered the apple pancake ($10), a huge mound of hyper gooey sweetness and buttery-cinnamon yellow delicious apples. It arrived in exactly 18 minutes like she said. My brother ordered the ham steak and eggs ($8) which came with either sour dough toast or regular pancakes. We also ordered hash browns which are more like home fries. Everything tasted good, and came to our table warm.    The total bill with coffee was $25 plus tax and tip.  One complaint I have is that this chain requires you to pay the cashier instead of your wait person.   There is no way an average person can finish this apple pancake in one sitting. It measures 12 inches in diameter and 3 inches tall and probably contains a cup of sliced apples in a custard-like pancake. It probably contains a half cup of sugar. Those with too much sugar in their diet, like me, really shouldn't order this hyper calorie dish. But it was too yummy to resist. So I just ate half and saved the rest for the next day.  Like the words of my overweight college track coach years ago  - do as I say, not as I do."}
{"text":"\"There have been great advances in waffle technology,\" I said to my friend Cat.  \"They have bacon waffles.  BACON waffles!   Don't you understand that this supercedes all previous pairings?  Oh, you thought peanut butter and chocolate was good... But bacon?  AND waffles?  Oh, the humanity!\"  \"You're exaggerating,\" she said.   \"NO,\" I replied firmly.  \"I am not.  They have the best bacon in the entire world - thick, meaty, chewy.  My wife and I cannot share a plate of bacon.  We each need our four slices to ourselves.  It is tragic.\"    \"But surely...\"  \"Surely you long for good maple syrup?  Honest ingredients?  And mad scientist recipes?\"  \"Are there no downsides?\"  \"There are a few,\" I grumbled.  \"First off, they're open until like 2:00.  Breakfast only.  Second, if you want some of the more spectacular pancak experiments, such as the basketball-sized dutch boy (which deflates when you poke a fork into it) or the apple pancake (which is basically an apple pie in a pancake) you have to wait a half an hour.   \"But the service is good, and even though the food is a little pricey for breakfast it's totally worth it.  You ready to go?\"  \"YES.\"  \"Well... crap.  It's 2:30.  Dang, why do we wait?\""}
{"text":"Always heard the hype around This place and overall I think I was a bit undewhelmed. Food was overall good but nothing really stood out to me. Not a huge fan of the watery syrup but the pancakes were good. Omelette pictured was just a tad too dried out. However the pecan French toast was amazing, I'd definitely make a appearance again for that. Next time back I will definitely explore the menu more.!"}
{"text":"My husband and I went here for breakfast this morning while finishing up some last minute Christmas Eve errands. We were seated promptly, and our server, Diana, was an absolute delight. She was friendly, the service was fast, and the food was, as always, delicious."}
{"text":"Unfortunately they have changed their recipe for hollandaise sauce. It's now very runny and too sweet.  I used to love their eggs benedict but will never get them again.  The apple pancake is still amazing.  And the omelets are wonderful."}
{"text":"I love a good pancake. That starchy goodness with a nice crisp edge and all the accouterments. Well, my journeys helped me to stumble across an import to the area from Oregon, the Original Pancake House. I ventured to get what I thought would be a standard omelet; boy was I wrong.  The Pancake House's omelet's are six-eggers, cooked in a skillet then baked and popped on a plate to look as imposing as a monolith. In addition, the pancakes are tasty, light and are accented by the syrup, which I was told is created daily on site, along with several other types including blueberry, strawberry and a cavalcade of flavors. The price was good, and atmosphere was simple and pleasing. I am a new fan and shall be stopping again, but if I get the omelet, I'm bringing a truck to haul the leftovers home in!"}
{"text":"I used to eat here all the time a few years ago but hadn't been back in at least 3 years. That all ended this weekend.   I went and I am happy to report the food is still very tasty. I got a vegetable omelet added bacon & gruyere cheese. Amazing! Pancakes where fluffy and light. I also had a taste of their Philly cheese steak, it was good too.   I'm glad I went back and it is just as good as I remember."}
{"text":"AMAZINGGGGGG experience!!!!! (THIS REVIEW IS LONG OVERDUE!!) I came here for my cheat meal after a competition about 2 weeks ago and ordered the large stack of buttermilk pancakes (6 in an order--very large and filling and yes I ate the entire thing) and asked for nutella and bananas on top with whipped on the side. IT WAS FREAKING DELICIOUS!!!!! I also ordered a side of their amazing thick cut bacon and an omlette. YES us bikini competitors can eat! I cannot find a picture of my meal on my phone and that makes me so sad because it was SO yummy and aesthetic looking. I posted it to my snapchat though :-) . The server/manager that took care of me was 10 out of 10 amazing. I can't remember her name but she was only a teenager and very smart and attentive. The floor manager was wonderful as well. Great coffee. AMAZING pancakes and everything was too perfect. Thank you so much. The next time i'm in Pittsburgh I will be back. DELICIOUS! Seriously, go here for breakfast if you want to be extremely satisfied and leave very happy! :-) Thank you."}
{"text":"I'd like to give 4.5 stars.  I enjoyed everything I had here--flavors were complex and well-developed. Coffee was great. The omelettes looked like cute, sunken souffles. Peanut butter chocolate chip pancakes were delicious (and the yeasty flavor of the pancakes kept me interested). They had veggie eggs Benedict (with no meat, perfect poached eggs, and creamy hollandaise sauce). And even the potatoes were great--crispy, just salty enough, not too greasy.  Expect to wait for a while (especially for brunch on Sundays), which seems to be pretty much par for a breakfast/brunch place. Some of the staff were a bit frazzled or disinterested (texting, rolling eyes, speaking shortly to those putting in their names), but our server was friendly and helpful (recommending ways to combine orders to save money, smiling and apologizing for the wait), and we got our food (which, to me, is the most important part of a restaurant) quickly.  I immediately texted my sister that we had to try this place next time she visited."}
{"text":"Delicious bananas foster French toast, cherry waffle, and thick sliced bacon. Friendly and fast service. Needs a bigger location as the tables are close together and we had to wait even on a weekday at 9:30am, and it was pretty loud. Still, a solidly positive experience and we'll be back."}
{"text":"When reading the reviews (albeit all 9 of em), I figure'd we couldn't go wrong, especially after my father recommended we hustle over to eat'n park for breakfast in Eastlake near his machine shop.  I now know that this place is no less a chain than eat'n park and frankly, wish I would have listened to my father (a recurring theme throughout life eh?)  I walked in, they had two hostesses on duty, it appeared as they had one busser and a handful of servers.  We sat after wandering their entrance area not seeing anyone, encountering the hostess on our way to a table, she seated us and provided menus.  My dad and I just wanted a good omelette.  Our server was nice, and enjoyed pouring our coffee from varying heights above the cup, and god bless her not a drop splashed onto my white shirt.  The coffee wasn't nearly as respectable as their \"fair trade organic\" whatever seal of green approval stuff made me think.  I ordered a mexican omelette and added sausage (they didn't have chorizo :-( not cool), my father had the same, less the meat.  It comes with three pancakes, no browns (yeah, no potatoes and it still cost $9!)  Long story short, it took nearly 30 minutes to get our food, when we did, we saw these three inch high round monstrosities of egg and filling and cheese.  I didn't know where to start!  I ate my pancakes.  They were delicious.  It was obvious to me that the cooks they had had no business cooking breakfasts.  The omelettes aren't folded, and had obviously stuck to the pan as they were a crumbly, mangled mess of overcooked eggs and filling.  They weren't bad tasting, but texture has a lot to do with a great omelette, and this place seemed to forget to read that chapter.  I finished my water and gave up on trying to drink the coffee, my father had emptied both of his beverages having only had a few bites of our meal.  A tall man (who I suspect was the \"manager\") stopped by and said \"Enjoy guys, everything looks good!\"  I chuckled in disbelief and sorrow as it obviously didn't look good, and the manager never really asked us what we thought, that's just a little bit of BS.  Anyway, our drinks needed filled when he stopped by, and obviously he didn't even know what to look for at a table when checking on them, as he should have had that server out within seconds with refills, instead we had our breakfast lube-free only getting refills once we were finished.  We won't return, I'd much rather have had breakfast at the aforementioned Eat'n park, at least they have smiley faced cookies."}
{"text":"Yum yum yum!   The strawberry waffle was magnificent! The waffle was.... Perfect. Can't believe how well it came out. Cream was a little too much, maybe get it on the side?   The eggs Benedict was average, but at least it wasn't horrible. I didn't like the potatoes that came with it. Could be cooked a little longer and in smaller pieces. Looked like boulders on my plate.   Don't underestimate the \"thick bacon\" which was AMAZING! I've never had thick bacon before, but I sure did love it. I got three eggs with it as well. Eggs was great as well, but I wish they didn't cook all three together on a small pan. It made the egg whites really thick.   Fruit salad bowl small was alright. I don't like grapes.!8 should of asked what it consisted of. It's seasonal so be sure to always ask!   ORANGE JUICE!! Freshly squeezed made me nostalgic to my mama's OJ. A+"}
{"text":"Great food. Pancakes are delish and can be made any sort of way. I love the coconut with tropical syrup. Best bacon around, too. Yum!"}
{"text":"Hands down the best breakfast I've had in years. There is a big commitment to quality here. I'll probably be dreaming about the bacon later. Nice thick cut and delicious. I highly recommend you try them out."}
{"text":"Yummy pancakes.. friendly staff.. great service.  Go for it if you love pancakes. We went there on a Saturday morning place was busy but we got seats after 10 minutes of wait."}
{"text":"This place to me is where my \"death row\" meal would come from - at least in part! Why you ask - please let me tell you!   1) Coffee - a special blend with a signature taste and smell only this OPH has! (Currently skipping due to Preggo status) but oh so good!   2) the pancakes - specifically the chocolate peanut butter chip ones, the pumpkin ones or the BACON pancakes (yes you read that right).   3) the huge baked omelettes that COME WITH 3 smaller pancakes! Boom!   4) the aforementioned bacon, bacon, bacon, BACON! Super long strips cooked on a diner griddle crispy to perfection!   I really dig this place - but weekends you will wait an hour PLUS - so go early or um take a \"sick day\" during the week"}
{"text":"My husband and I both do not like pancakes but they came with our omelettes. They were amazing!!!! Not dense, not overly sweet, perfect little pancakes.   We got omelettes (ham and cheese for me, sausage and cheese for husband). Huge huge huge portions, so good.   We were stuffed for hours and loved it so much we came back a week later. We will keep coming back!!!!"}
{"text":"Food is generally good breakfast food. Service runs very hot and cold. Hostess is not effective. Dull normal. If their service improved, would be a great breakfast place."}
{"text":"This was our first visit, me and my wife got the oven baked omlettes, I got the mushroom which was very good I thought and she got the corned beef hash which was good but a little skimpy on the CBH I thought. These omlettes were massive (probably enough for two) and she couldn't finish hers so I helped but gave up because I was so full. My daughter got the lasagna which she liked, I tried it and thought it was good as well. The restaurant itself is very upscale looking and has flat screen TVs and I think ESPN was on, as far as ambience goes it blows IHOP out of the water. As far as the menu goes it wasn't very extensive compared to IHOP, the complete dining experience (service/food/atmosphere) is good enough to recommend OPH. I actually was least impressed with their pancakes, they were okay but quite small, with a name like OPH I expected some big honkin flapjacks like I've seen on Food Networks \"Man vs Food\" or \"Diners, Drive Ins and Dives\".  Oh, if you're on a budget look for their coupon in the Valu Pak which comes periodically in the mail. Even with the coupon we nearly spent $40 including the tip. Although next time we'll save some money by ordering just one omlette."}
{"text":"For being a chain type of place this is pretty tasty. I love any of the pancakes. The bacon smokes !!! I have fond memories of this place. Give it a shot for a Sunday breakfast with someone you love."}
{"text":"The outside appearance was good and the inside was iffy. The hostess was kind of rude but our waitress was really nice and very good. The strawberry pancakes were fantastic and even came with a warm strawberry syrup. The bacon pancakes were good but a tad bit on the dry side. This place has some of the best bacon I have ever had. I paid the bill at the register on my way out where the person taking my payment did not speak one word to me the whole entire transaction. Would probably return but not to this location just due to the unfriendliness of 2/3 of the employees we encountered"}
{"text":"I have been to TOPH several times and I'm never disappointed. You may have read in other posts, yes, their omelettes are made with 6 eggs and are spectacular. Most omelettes and other dishes come with a side of pancakes. I usually stick with the omelettes, but have had several of the pancakes, all of which are delicious especially pumpkin.  I had a chance to talk to the owner and he seems like a good guy. He claims they have the best Bacon in Cleveland and he may he right, it's that good. Also, I should add the portions are huge, consider splitting a meal with someone."}
{"text":"There are a few reasons to love OHOP. First of all it is clean. Hello? Is this too much to ask of a breakfast place? Second of all it has Wifi, this is mandatory in 2010. Third of all the coffee is the perfect temperature, reasonably decent and served frequently.  But we go there for the food right? The pancakes are very respectable for a pancake house, carnivores love the bacon, and I love the potatoes. They are the real deal. Delicious sauteed potatoes with onions and spices. Not pedestrian hash browns or glorified french fries. Real, delicious potatoes. When I am not in diet mode, I get a double order. I don't really understand the omelettes, they are baked not fried. They are dutch or something. Then again, why do people order eggs at a pancake house? Management is very nice, they run a tight ship. The staff seems to stay there, I like that.  These days, I am getting their oatmeal. It is less fattening then their house made granola which is surprisingly delicious. If you are going on a weekend get their before 9:30 am or be patient as you sit in line..."}
{"text":"During a trip to Cleveland, a colleague INSISTED that we make time for breakfast here before an 7.30AM meeting -- so my mindset going in was \"this better be WAY better than my hotel's free breakfast.\" Turns out getting there stupid early helps beat the crowds that people have mentioned.  And it was definitely good (definitely better than IHOP), with some intense pancake and omelette options. I can see this being a good once in a while celebratory weekend brunch place, but if it's a choice of waking up at 5.30AM, or if  you're just not into 1000 calorie breakfasts, stick to the free hotel buffet for a weekday."}
{"text":"My husband and I absolutely love the OPH!! Fantastic breakfast selections and very well priced for the amount of food you get. Big portions. I tend to order the same things over and over because they're so darn good but I don't think there is anything bad on the menu. If your really hungry and don't mind waiting a few extra minutes on cook time, then I highly suggest you try the \"Dutch Baby\" a delicious pancake/crepe type of morning breakfast goodie. They serve it with lemon,powdered sugar and butter. All three on it are divine. This location is our favorite spot because it's close to home. We will continue to come here on weekends for as long as we live on Cleveland's West side! Keep up the great work staff at the OPH!!"}
{"text":"I wanted to give this place 2 stars. Maybe it was because I was grumpy today, but I couldn't justify two stars. The service was good. The food came out quick, but the value and taste is just not there. Maybe because it's called The Original Pancake House and I was expecting yummy, thick, and flavorful pancakes but instead got spongy, bland, weird (dad and I couldn't put our finger on it) tasting pancakes. Breakfasts are special, and when you find a good place, you hang onto it...I guess that's what I get for cheating on Steve's Diner."}
{"text":"The food was delicious, and the service was great, it just wasn't as good as the Detroit location.  The Dutch ___ seemed smaller than the one in Detroit.  I'll go back and try again."}
{"text":"This was my first and last visit.  I met up with a few high school friends here on 11am on a Saturday.  We waited for 35 minutes for a table, then had about 20 minutes at the table before being rushed out.  The waitress brought everything quickly--we had drinks, food, and the check (before we ever took a bite) within 7 minutes of sitting down.  I had the blueberry pancakes, which were dry and overcooked--Bisquick is better.  The water provided for my tea was lukewarm at best.  The waitress hovered around to take every cup or plate the second we finished.  Next time, I'll make my own pancakes at home so I don't have to feel like I'm being rushed."}
{"text":"This pre-Christmas breakfast was perfect. Spinach omelette was cooked perfectly sausage gravy crapes were so delicious with hashbrowns. The basic egg and sausage links were cooked to perfection. The waffle was absolutely divine. Crisp on the outside and nice and tender inside. Top with Lingonberries it was Scrumptious. It was our first time there and the atmosphere was so warm and cozy and it was so clean which is very important to me. Very nice get together with family with no clean up after LOL. The only negative appeared to be the basics of serving water, silverware, cream as we had to ask for everything"}
{"text":"Food was alright, service was fine. Silverware was dirty which is a huge disappointment."}
{"text":"Went again this morning. We got the Salami and eggs and the apple pancake and a glass of grapefruit juice.   Both were just ok, not at all as good as the omelet, which is my fav there. The salami and eggs was not scrambled, which is what we expected but more of a quiche type of thing.  This came with potato pancake, which again nothing special and were a bit greasy.  We also go the apple pancake which was really good, but it needed more apples and less \"pancake\" doughy stuff. The whip cream was still really yummy though.   the juice was great, nice and fresh squeezed. and service was also again really good.   i recommended that you skip everything else on the menu, and go for the omelet since that is incredible and def the best thing, and have them add chocolate chips to the side of pancakes."}
{"text":"This place was a great find! Had to wait a little as it was busy for Sunday breakfast, but once we were sat it was worth the wait! The staff was incredibly friendly and prompt. The food was delicious, and the portions were a large size. Our group got pancakes, both regular and blueberry and they were good. The omelettes were the size of the plates and extremely filling. Crab cake eggs benedict were also a hit! All and all worth the wait, and would return at any time!!"}
{"text":"Wow.  Just called in for takeout.   Their response:  \"we are too busy. Not taking call ins today. Sorry\".    How about you staff accordingly?   What a way to ruin Father's Day jackasses."}
{"text":"Never been disappointed. The food is great the service is what you'd expect at a diner. Wish they took call-ahead reservations but well worth the wait. I love the crepes!"}
{"text":"Unmatched experience for customer service and flavor. Seriously above any other pancake spot in Pittsburgh"}
{"text":"Kind of interesting how mixed some of the reviews are? For me, this place is always a winner. Great staff and quick service. Sometimes a wait to get in, but their omelettes are great, love the pancakes, and the bacon is among the best I've had anywhere. This place is very kid and large group friendly and the menu has a great variety of offerings. It is not inexpensive, but I've always felt that I got a fair value for my $$. Only negative is the location, as this section of Chagrin seems to get worse every year. I usually go here first and then across the street to Trader Joes. The reverse route is next to impossible!!"}
{"text":"I love this place! The pancakes, even the healthy ones, are so tasty. Omelettes are amazing and creatively prepared. Service is wonderful and friendly. The only downside is that it isn't open long enough during the day! Every time I come into town to visit my family, I have to stop by this place. Thanks to the management, servers and cooks who make my every brunch experience at this place a delicious fiesta for my taste buds!"}
{"text":"Okay this place is just the jam. Best bacon, hands-down, in the Greater Cleveland area. The pancakes are great, but all the other food is great, too!   The freaking apple pancake is mind-blowingly delicious. But be warned: it's like an upside-down apple pie. Same size and everything. So get one to share! (And order it early because it takes a while).   My favorite: the 3-2-1 breakfast. Such a good deal! 3 pancakes, 2 bacons, 1 egg. YES.   It's worth the wait for a table! Service is good and they're very attentive to coffee & water refills.   Keep up the great work, Original Pancake House!"}
{"text":"Man the pancake dishes they have here are incredible. For me personally though I prefer good Ole delicious pancakes without all the fancy stuff piled on top. I've worked hard on my figure and I plan on keeping it. Wait, I should eat all the gooey stuff on top then.  The meats are tasty as is the coffee. Plenty of sides to add onto your meal such as grits, bacon, sausage or hash.  The place is huge inside and pretty but it comes with a price. PH is expensive."}
{"text":"ok, truth be told:  other than going to see my most awesome niece and nephew and kick ass sister, THIS is the reason i go to vegas.  yes, there are oph's here in the bay but they can't even begin to compare to the marvel that is the restaurant located in the green valley ranch resort.  everyone that works there is amazing and personable and accomodating.  and everyone there works their butts off.  there is constant hustle.    everything we have had there is delicious.  i am a fan of the irish omelette (cheese and corned beef hash inside).  try it with the gouda and you can't go wrong.  their cheesy potatoes are pretty yum as well.  my niece is a huge fan of the chocolate chip pancakes and always manages to cram in more than she can actually eat.  it's pretty amazing.  other items that have found their way to our table in past visits have been the 49er, the eggs benedict, the potato pancakes, scrambles, crepes and loads of coffee.  everything is big, filling, full of flavor and served quickly.  green valley ranch is gorgeous and classy to begin with.  the restaurant just follows suit.  there is no vegas cheese factor here.  the place is always packed when we go and yet we have never had slow or bad service.  for us, it's like the cherry on top of the sundae of our visit!"}
{"text":"My husband got the apple pancake. Pretty good but it was more  like a cooked apple tart/pie. Good freshly squeezed OJ. I had the cherry crepe. A little sweet for my taste in the AM. Seemed more like a dessert item, needed a side of Turkey sausage tk counterbalance that sweetness, definitely hit the spot."}
{"text":"BEST PANCAKES EVER!!  I do not know what they add to their pancake batter, but it works for me!  Moist and melt-in-your-mouth goodness.  We have been here (Chagrin Blvd. location), several times over the years.  The owners, Mike and Jane are almost always there, greeting and talking with customers. best bet is to get there early, before 9am to get a seat without a delay.   After that time, the crowds arrive...but it is worth the wait!  Kudos to Mike and Jane - lots of hard work, but you two have created a great place."}
{"text":"Breakfast for dinner, what a fantastic idea! We ventured off to Green Valley Ranch for some pancakes and eggs at the Original Pancake House.   It was close to closing time and though I generally despise doing that to the wait staff, my craving for sweet and delicious pancakes overrode my general rule of thumb on this occasion.   The Station Casinos cafe converted into the Pancake House seemed to be a smooth transition. Seated in a comfy booth the service was timely.   Let's talk food, pancakes were comparable to my usual pick, IHOP and the eggs, eh, they were your usual scrambled deal, nothing special. The German potatoes or whatever they're calling them there (ya know, the carbs that accompany your breakfast?), they were seasoned nicely and I did not have a hard time clearing them off of my plate.   All in all, I am still perplexed by the cost of OJ! I understand there may be some additional labor involved in \"fresh squeezed\" juice, but $4 for a highball glass, really? Whatevs, that is my only real gripe with this fine establishment, that and the fact that the venue closes.   IT'S VEGAS PEOPLE, everything's 24-hours, that's the appeal, isn't it?! And GVR doesn't really have a 24-hour eatery happening anymore so why not leave the Pancake House open for all hungry sinners? Just a suggestion ;)   Give it a whirl if you're in the area, not worth a special trip but did a nice job in hitting the breakfast craving spot."}
{"text":"We weren't the last customers of the day and they already ran out of bananas and bacon? We got half a banana order and no bacon :-(  On the plus side, the whipped cream for the banana was sweet and light.  Yummy.  Wifey ordered the dutch baby, which came out 15 minutes sooner than the rest of our food. I'm not sure if that is customary, but usually all our entrees are brought out to everyone at the same time. She didn't care much that her pancake had burned sides and a butter pool, but it tasted pretty good to me.   My brother's cheesy omelet was definitely a wonderment of constipation. He stopped eating his pancakes because he found a curly hair in the stack. I'm not sure, but my sister said that her turkey sausages tasted like beef. Nephew was supposed to have a scrambled egg with his waffle, but sadly, it never arrived.   My eggs were prepared properly as were the sausage links and potatoes, but I was a bit disappointed that the potatoes were soggy and bland, as if they were prepared hours ago or came from the frozen food section. I just prefer crispier taters with some seasoning. I want flava - it's a restaurant, not a retirement home.   Drinks were refilled at a good pace and I think that our server did the very best she could despite the circumstances. She did explain our situation to the manager (without any prompting from us), who came by the table to adjust the bill and apologize for the inconveniences.   The cashier/hostess area was vacant for about five minutes while a line formed behind me before the store manager walked over to ring up my bill.  I couldn't help but smile while leaving because the waitress seemed happy about the tip I left on her table.  I believe in maintaining good karma from the foodie gods."}
{"text":"First Visit - Waited in line for 15 minutes Hostess: Just want to let you know that we are out of pancake batter  Second Visit (the next morning, waited in line for 40 minutes) - Ordered the Dutch Baby (Oven baked. Served with whipped butter, lemon and powdered sugar.) Damn good pancake, but come on, how can the Original Pancake House be out of Pancakes???"}
{"text":"I ordered eggs and bacon which is accompanied by either pancakes or toast.  I think it cost $8.99.  The eggs and bacon were cooked exactly as I requested and food was really hot.  The bacon is thick and of very high quality--the best I've had at any local restaurant.  I took the pancakes home.  Our waitress was efficient and friendly even though she had what looked like eight to ten other tables to handle.  Staff is quick to remove empty plates from tables and wash and reset tables.  I enjoy having breakfast here but only on off hours, as during peak hours it's quite a madhouse."}
{"text":"Service was amazing! Waitress was very quick with everything. Mexican eggs Benedict were extremely delicious and filling as well. Eggs were poached correctly and not hard boiled throughout. Fresh fruit on pancakes and had 0 complaints from our party."}
{"text":"While I wanted to love the Original Pancake House, I just wasn't impressed by my food - or the portions. The restaurant itself seems lovely, but I'll need to try something else if I ever come here again.  PROS: -Presentation of food was great. Whomever was in the kitchen clearly wanted all of the food that made it to the table to look pretty.  -Restaurant is in a good location for hitting up a lot of the other Westgate businesses. It's part of a long, multi-curved strip mall, so you can get breakfast then hit shopping - or do it the other way around - without having to move your car.  -Restaurant has free Wi-Fi. Did not utilize this. -Despite coming on a Sunday early-afternoon with a slight wait, they were able to get me in relatively quickly. It was a very peaceful dining experience with my waitress checking in regularly, getting service/refills as necessary, and never having to wait too long for any \"step\" of the restaurant process. Food was served quickly, order was taken quickly, and check was taken care-of quickly.   CONS: -I ordered a Nutella crepe and a single waffle. When I asked the waitress how filling these items were, she assured me that I wouldn't be able to finish if I ordered them both. I left the restaurant still feeling hungry - and I'm usually the person in my party who can't finish their ordered dish. -The Nutella Crepe wasn't good at all. Probably one of the worst I've ever tried. The crepe itself was light and fluffy and very egg-like. Perfect for a Savory-type of crepe. However, it has virtually no Nutella on it outside of a small dollop on the top of the rolling crepe. If you're not looking for sweet when you order a dessert-like crepe, that might be a good fit for you, but I was pretty disappointed. -The Cherry Waffle was very beautiful, and it tasted pretty good, but again, light on the \"toppings\" that were ordered with it. I expected something that claimed to be made with in-house-made cherry sauce to have a decent amount of the sauce on it."}
{"text":"Me and my Son was in town for a chess tournament and needed to eat breakfast. there was only two options and decided to give this a try. My Son order crepes and I order eggs over easy, ham and pancakes.  they made my eggs over easy perfectly.and the ham was delicious, however I felt the ham was a little small. The Pancakes I didn't like at all. it had an odd taste to it. Also I felt the pancakes was very small. Especially the price I paid for it. And pancakes are super cheap.   My son didn't like his crepes at all which is really unusual because she usually loves crepes. However he is a picky eater, but looking at how my meal was I probably wouldn't question it.  I usually dont mention service in my reviews because to me it is all about the food. However, we was the very first people in the restaurant and about 10 minutes a lot of people was there. However it took about 30 minutes for us to get our food and half the people in the place already had their food. And in top of that, I felt our waitress was a little rude to us.   I am not sure if this is a chain or not put will not visit one again. Especially the price of the food and the quality that we got."}
{"text":"Greatest breakfast place all day amazing choice of pancakes and eggs they keep pouring the coffee without asking."}
{"text":"Food was very mediocre. I got the seafood omelet which was really good but the pancakes taste like they were frozen. I've had eggo's pancakes that tasted better. My sister had the ham and left half of it on the table. My cousin orange juice had something brown in it. He was told that it was a seed since the juice is squeezed fresh. He could also have pulp and skin in his juice. (Weird look placed here) Never had anyone of us heard that before. It was 6 of us at the table and no one was really impressed. Not at add that we had horrible service from our waiter. He was not attentive at all and plan rude. I really don't see myself coming back to this location if I'm ever in the area again. I'm only giving it 3 stars because that seafood omelet sauce was on point!"}
{"text":"We went here on a whim one morning as it was the closest breakfast place. We knew that being in a ritzy neighborhood it was likely to be pricey, but we were surprised by exactly how expensive it was. My partner and I each got a half order of French toast (2 small pieces of sourdough, $5.69 each), I had bacon ($5.59!!!) that was overcooked, he had sausage ($4.49) which was underdone, and we each got a beverage. All told our bill +tip was $35, which is kind of ridiculous for breakfast, especially given what we had ordered. The food wasn't great, the service was fine, and this place is horrendously overpriced. Even for Chagrin. We won't be back."}
{"text":"THE best breakfast I've had yet. So yummy. I paid under ten dollars for a huge omelet that came with 4 mini, delicious pancakes. The syrup tin is so cute too :) Will definitely visit again."}
{"text":"Going here early on a weekday is the best idea.  The wait staff is very friendly and attentive. They don't mind answering lots of questions about the overwhelming menu options. I had the Italian Omelette on a day when it was just what I was craving and it was magical. But be warned, the omelettes contain 6 eggs so they are not for the weak of heart.  As an added bonus, almost everything comes with a stack of their yummy fluffy pancakes.  I've also had the breakfast crepes, steak and eggs and just the simple breakfast and I've never been disappointed.  The menu is vast and can be overwhelming.  I work overnights and at 7am when I leave, this has become a favorite spot for breakfast with co-workers."}
{"text":"The atmosphere is nothing special, but the food easily wins me over every time.  Their Apple Pancake may very well be the Eighth Wonder of the World.  To quote the website, it's \"a single large pancake smothered with sautéed apples and cinnamon sugar baked to perfection.\"  That about sums it up, with an emphasis on \"perfection.\"    The omelets are excellent too, but I wish they came with hash browns instead of 3 pancakes.  A side dish is wholly unnecessary when you've got a 6-egg omelet to deal with -- can we say heart attack on a plate? - but for the sake of variety I do like a little something on the side, and hash browns seem like a much better pairing than pancakes.  And their hash browns are delicious.  I had to deduct one star for the lack of ambiance combined with the noise coming from the open kitchen, which can be annoying, but the food is well worth it."}
{"text":"Pancakes - coconut with tropical syrup - were to die for. Husband had the crab eggs Benedict which he thoroughly enjoyed. I had corned beef hash which was pretty gross, actually. Tasted like it was canned, super salty and the pink color of a pencil eraser. But our wonderful waitress Cathy - older, blonde, adorable drawl and great service, made up for the one less-than-stellar dish."}
{"text":"Best breakfast I've ever had, hands down. Green Chilli Omlette and the GF coconut pancakes were amazing. Also, our server Dominick was friendly, knowledgable, and quick! Five stars."}
{"text":"Decent place to grab breakfast inside the Green Valley Ranch. Has an IHOP feel to it (what do you expect from a chain) and the line can appear daunting, but moves rather fast. In true Vegas fashion its right next to a slew of slot machines to keep you occupied. Decent solid food. Nothing really stood out, but certainly higher quality than IHOP. Great attentive waitstaff and a good deal for the food you receive. Overall I would recommend it, but nothing special."}
{"text":"We were out in Cleveland August 20-27 this year and happened to be looking for a nice breakfast/lunch place. We had seen this place earlier on in the week. Wonderful breakfast...large portions, tasty pancakes and good coffee. Very busy, almost every table was being used and this was during the week. A little messy but not what I'd call \"dirty\". Only drawback was the noise level."}
{"text":"This is one of the few times that I give a restaurant 5 stars. As I'm writing this it's October 1st, so I came in looking for some pumpkin pancakes. I found them on the menu and made my order. A very generously sized order came and I had the best pumpkin pancakes I've ever had.   The restaurant itself was a bit crowded but that's to be expected on a Sunday morning. The coffee was just right and our server, Amanda was excellent.  If you're reading this review looking for breakfast food and pancakes are on the mind, look no further than the pancake House."}
{"text":"Backing a star off.  Not exactly sure what's going on, but as time has gone on, the food just isn't as good.  I'd guess that they're cutting corners and pinching pennies, which is a big issue for a place like this because it's one of the more expensive breakfasts in Cleveland, and the quality of the food was the only thing justifying that.  First we noticed the bacon wasn't as amazing.  Then the bread.  Then the omelettes just didn't taste the same.  We used to go 4-5 times a month, now we basically hardly ever go.  Not that we've found another place with better food for less...but we just feel like the main thing that brought us there in the first place has been tampered with.  Had we walked in for the first time today, I might never have known the difference and been happy.  But you don't mess with your best feature."}
{"text":"Our party of 5 had a great breakfast here! Food was good, service was good. We ordered gluten free pancakes which were great. Kids and adults all happy. Would definitely go back!"}
{"text":"We come for breakfast quite often...probably 3 to 4 times a month, food is always good and lots of it...waitstaff is great. We had a new waitress yesterday who was sweet and adorable, Ashley? I think was her name. Pumpkin pancakes and potato pancakes were delicious. Everything was good and I would have given 5 stars EXCEPT The horrible blonde hostess woman who seemed to get pleasure by being rude to customers as they were paying and leaving. She is awful. She is outwardly rude to customers and seems to gain pleasure by being so....we left a 30% cash tip for our waitress the other day...she thought it was her place to advise me that I was \" required\" to tip on my credit card at minimum of 15%...not her place to tell me how much or that a tip was required. A tip is a courtesy, not a requirement. We always tip at minimum 20 to 30% depending on service, so her advice would have cost our wonderful server. The hostess needs to learn customer service, basic kindness, general politeness if that is possible. She took a 5 star experience and dropped it to a 3...had our service been off or the food not as good, she could have lost you good customers. TRAIN HER..PLEASE! the next time I hear her being rude or condescending to myself or another customer, I promise I will be calling her out on her rudeness and to management. She is a major detriment to your business.  To other customers, be aware that the awful hostess woman will be rude, will tell you how to tip and will make snide comments about you ...but the food is good and most of the waitstaff is good...so ignore the crabby hostess, she has a lot of bad days, and enjoy your breakfast or lunch."}
{"text":"One of the best breakfast spots on the East side! Service is fast, but arrive early to avoid a long wait. The biscuits & gravy are the real deal... homemade & delicious. The blueberry delight pancakes are to die for! My only critique is that the home fries aren't crispy enough for my liking, but the flavor is there."}
{"text":"First of all - do not go here unless you're hungry!  The regular portion of pancakes is 6 pancakes!  The omlette my husband ordered had something like 5 or 6 eggs in it!  All that said, the food was awesome.  I had a half order of pancakes with perfectly cooked poached eggs and my husband had a sante fe omlette.  He said it was the best omlette he had ever had and I cleared my plate of pancakes (half portion). It was all very delicious and the service was friendly and prompt - overall a great breakfast."}
{"text":"This was great place to eat.. Food was awesome!!! I wasn't  sure at first cause of only a three star review. Glad we decided to try it out... Fast service, great waitress..."}
{"text":"My first OPH experience was here back in 2005. When my friend and I went we didn't have much of a wait. Tried the Dutch Baby and it is HUGE. Can't say I'm a big fan of that dish, I mean it's good and all but after eating a quarter of it you want something with a little bit more variety but hey that's just me."}
{"text":"This location is located inside the Green Valley Ranch Casino. It's kinda hard to find, so just follow the signs inside.   What to expect: all your typical breakfast food. Emphasis on different kinds of pancakes in HUGE portions. They have at least 10 different types of pancakes to choose from so I always have a hard time making a decision. They also have your other breakfast favorites like waffles, omletes, bacon, etc.   Their omletes are HUGE and very fluffy since they're oven baked. I've tried almost all of them and they're all equally delicious. They also come with a side of pancakes so it's good pick!  Potato Pancakes: basically hash browns in a pancake form. Comes with apple sauce. This dish is a little too greasy for me, but the pancakes are crispy and the apple sauce helps counter act some of the greasiness.   Eggs Michael: pretty much eggs benedict except with their mushroom sauce which is basically a creamy mushroom sauce that reminds me of cream of mushroom soup. Not bad.   Overall if you're looking for a nice place for a Sunday brunch with the family, this would be a nice place to go :)"}
{"text":"So good and the place was petty cool on the inside. Went 2 says in a row while in Pittsburgh. Cornbeef hash was awsome!"}
{"text":"Outstanding The pancakes are fabulous and the eggs Benedict were great Coming back when in town"}
{"text":"Ideal place for breakfast or brunch but come early or plan to wait an excessive amount of time.  Known for their Dutch Baby. It is a delightful,  delicious treat. Known also for their incredibly thick smokey bacon, no matter what you order, add it to your meal.  The Cherry crepes and Seafood crepes are tasty not to be missed.  The 3 pancakes that come with every egg order can be upgraded for a couple bucks to add Pecans, Bananas,  blueberries,  whatever your flavah! They have that outstanding fluffy inside and crispy edge.  One little side bar...be prepared to wait outside or in your car with the windows down so you can hear your name being called on a Sat or Sun...   If you are claustrophobic or impatient. ..this place is not for you! You will likely elbow next to someone while you wait, be seated so close to another party you can hear them whisper and wait up to or over an hour for a table.  Worth the wait!"}
{"text":"I don't come here nearly as often as I'd like to, but it's probably for the best because of how much I clean my plate.  The OHOP really delivers on is value proposition of serving a fabulous array of pancakes.  I've had several, from the German/Dutch Baby to the classic with some sort of flavoring.  Blueberry is my go-to fave, though, and they are perfect as far as I'm concerned.  It may also surprise patrons to know, however, that their non-pancake items are stars in their own right.  For instance, the bacon that is nice and thick and stands up on its own.  A 4 slice side ain't cheap, but it's worth it. Their omelettes are also lovely and huge; I don't recommend trying to eat an entire one by yourself with other food unless you're a bodybuilder or have a tapeworm or something. Bring a buddy and split it; that's what I do.  All in all, when it comes to breakfast, OHOP is one of my favorite places."}
{"text":"Very good place to eat good portions great for family's friendly device tropical syrup is very tasty as well as the apple. They all come out warm for the pancakes"}
{"text":"Dutch baby! Dutch baby! Dutch baby! Apple pancake! Apple pancake! Apple pancake! The church of pancakes. The pinnacle. The Aristotelian pancake ideal. So good, and so crowded, all the time, because it's so good. Great with kids. It's a just a *tad* too expensive, but I don't care, because it's so good."}
{"text":"My friend kind of hyped this place up and I think my expectations were set too high.  It's a chain, with really nothing great to write home about.  I think if you want to wait a half hour and order the Dutch Apple pancake you're probably in for a treat, however, I can't eat super sweet breakfast food and just opted for your standard Western Omelet with the two buttermilk pancakes on the side.  Not bad, just nothing that I couldn't have made in the comfort of my own kitchen.  Service was fine, the ambiance is nothing special.  I wouldn't go out of my way to come here again."}
{"text":"This is your all American diner but just done a lot better. Excellent customer service , had the spinach feta sundried tomato omelette ... Pancakes amazing. Also great crepes. Highly recommended. Prepare for a wait though."}
{"text":"Absolutely outstanding, the breakfast potatoes were fabulous. A simple breakfast but darn good. Pretty good crowd for 10 am on a weekday."}
{"text":"The food here is SO GOOD!!!!! The people are very friendly and nice. Although we were seated right near the back with a group of 5 it was still amazing. It is very cosy and there's not much space. They always have weird hours, so be sure to go on the earlier side!"}
{"text":"third time a charm? not so much. been waiting 45 minutes for our order and its still not here! wasted our whole saturday morning, no time for anything now."}
{"text":"The Original Pancake House is basically a diner.  Simple food, prepared quickly.  The quality is decent -- think upgraded Denny's -- but nothing special or worth repeated visits unless you like a bland breakfast.   There's nothing particularly amazing about the food or menu choices, but if you're carting around a load of kids, it's not a bad place to go for lots of pancake options (chocolate chip, whole wheat, blueberry, etc).  When we went, we ordered crepes and blueberry pancakes.  The crepes were too sweet and the blueberries on the pancakes weren't fresh.  But the service was great, the coffee never-ending and the bacon was perfectly crispy."}
{"text":"After opening more than a hundred franchised restaurants, you have to wonder when the \"Original\" name becomes worthless.  Located in yet another soul-less strip mall, this OPH is clean, well-managed, and predictable.  Charming?  Naah.  Homey?  Please.  Solid?  Yeah, solid.  You get good grub, reasonable prices without all that fussy \"personality\" clogging up your dining experience.  I was working nearby and just needed a quick late breakfast/early lunch and had never been to an Original.  The menu?  Six eggs in each omelette.  Let that sink in, for just a minute:  every omelette served up in this joint has a half dozen eggs.  That should be enough for a family of six, but wait for it...  You also get THREE buttermilk pancakes, with each omelette.  I struggled with the menu for a bit, then ordered a BLT; it was the only way I could figure out how NOT to have my meal with a sidecar trio of gut-busting flapjacks.  (On the corporate website, there is an actual page called \"What Are Pancakes?\"  So, let me get this straight:  A customer has made it to the page called \"The Original Pancake House,\" yet you feel they may still have this one nagging question:  \"I know what an Original House is, but  what the heck are pancakes?\"  I may have over-estimated the knowledge of the general population.  Again.)  I suppose, if you're really, really hungry, say if you've just made bail, or you decided to end your month-long fast in protest of our nation's over-consumption of eggs, this place makes sense.  Otherwise?"}
{"text":"There's that one girl.  I think you'll remember her:  just a bit heavy on the makeup, hair and clothes a good decade off being current, but boy.  Ready.  Always, always ready.  Some call her \"a go-er.\"  Just say where and when.  Original Pancake House.  \"A sure thing.\"  Hate the setting, Mid-west Strip Mall Contemporary.  Hate the section of Chagrin Boulevard, where it transitions from two lanes, to one lane turn only, to no lanes that ever move because Eton shoppers are texting their Whole Foods organic mung bean recipes while \"driving.\"  Hate a bunch of things.  But the food?  Ah, there's only love for the food.  Great service, too, almost old-fashioned and familiar.  First time ever at this place and had three people talk with me like they actually wanted me there and were willing to make sure I would return.  Busy times will always have a line, because good food and service will out.  I surveyed three other tables and could only find full satisfaction.  How very refreshing.  A sure thing.  A \"go-er.\"  (And if you see her, let me know.  I kinda miss old mattress-back.)"}
{"text":"We stumbled on this restaurant when we were planning on going to Dennys. Going to the pancake house was the best decision we made that day. We've been back a few times since and we'll be back!"}
{"text":"I hate to be a pain in the ass, but how can it be the original? Aren't there something like a 100 of these joints around the country? Their website is also pretty misleading. What's that old house they've got on there? Must be the actual original pancake house. This \"Original\" Pancake House is in a strip mall across from a Petco. And did I actually see a link that said \"What are pancakes?\" Click it. It's entertaining.  I have to agree with the other Yelpers, this place is a bit like IHOP. I guess because they serve pancakes? I would imagine that if you're looking for pancakes you could do worse than heading here. They've got plenty of pancake variety with everything from year-round pumpkin to apple and chocolate chip versions. They've also got something called Danish Kijafa Cherry. I went with the standard buttermilk and they were pretty good - a little flat - but good. The golden discs, about 6\" in diameter, were slightly sweet, moist and tender. The real maple syrup was a nice touch.  My wife had the Georgia pecan pancakes. They were also tasty with a huge mound of chopped pecans on top and some baked into the pancakes for good measure.   The service during our visit was good. Our coffees were never empty, we got water without asking and our server didn't hover. Given how busy it was around 9am on a Sunday this was a pleasant surprise.  Now for the reason I'm giving TOPH 3-stars instead of 2 and the main reason I'd actually consider coming back - the bacon. Sure, a side of the stuff will set you back $4, but this is no ordinary bacon. Where IHOP is content to serve wilted, greasy tasteless slivers of wannabe bacon, this place goes all out. Talk about some fantastic pig candy. It's thick, meaty and grilled just right. It's not too crispy and not to soft. It's more of a meat stick than a slab of bacon. I chopped a strip up and mixed it with some pancake and syrup. Come to think of it, they have a bacon pancake on the menu. Get them. It'll save some time.  The Original Pancake House is a chain, so don't expect something terribly original. Hey, that's kinda ironic...anyway, just go in expecting some pretty good breakfast grub, a United Colors of Benetton selection of flapjacks and some bacon that'll have you considering a return visit.  P.S. I really had to work hard to ignore all of the annoying kids running around the joint especially the one that stood next to me jumping up and down like a crazed rabbit that forgot its Ritalin.  I can remember when parents were actually parents..."}
{"text":"What was ordered: Breakfast for two  Ham and cheese omelet - This was an enormous omelet. Meh the omelet itself was okay. Luke warm ham chunks and a mound of cheddar cheese plopped on top - next time I'll order something else.  I'd give it 2.5 stars for taste and 1 for presentation.   Huevos Rancheros - In the bite that I had, I thought the green chili was surprisingly tasty and the eggs were cooked to order.    As for the side of pancakes, they were average.  I expected a little more from a self titled pancake house.  The pancakes were a little too firm and lacking some fluff.  Maybe a large stack would have been fluffier?  Total was about $28 including tax and tip. _____________  The service was okay and for a Sunday morning and the wait was reasonable.  (I think about 10 minutes for a table of 2).   One thing that bothers me about this place is that a cup of coffee is $2.09.  $2 is steep and then they charge the extra 9 cents to be extra greedy!  Sure sure, I sound like a miser writing this, but come on Pancake House!!!  It's criminal to be charging this much for a cup of of coffee to go with breakfast.     To sum it up, for your average $10-12 enormous breakfast + $2.09 cup of coffee, The Original Pancake House is an okay/overpriced option.  Don't go in with high expectations.  I consider it one step above IHOP.  2.5 stars overall, but I'll round up to 3."}
{"text":"Let me tell ya what: this place is the goddamn bomb diggity.   I've been coming here with my mom since I was a little kid!   OPH is my absolute favorite breakfast/ brunch restaurant, and it's clearly a beloved gem to Woodmere because it's always poppin' when I come, and there's usually a wait. But I don't even care, because the food will blow your mind, and leave you in warm carb coma oblivion.   Here's a tip: get a side of bacon. Who cares about your arteries and cholesterol. Your taste buds and stomach will thank you. It's super thick cut, smokey, and it'll give your taste buds the tango of a life time.   Corn beef hash is always bomb! The potatoes are super delicious. Pancakes are light and fluffy, and served with REAL maple syrup!"}
{"text":"To compare the Original Pancake House to iHop is a crime.  iHOP is bastion to corn syrup, sugar and over processed foods loaded with artificial ingredients, which barely resemble anything real.  By contrast the Original Pancake House does everything from scratch.  Even the OJ is fresh squeezed.  The pancake batters are mixed fresh each day from basic ingredients like flour, baking powder, eggs, buttermilk or water and salt.  When you order a strawberry pancake you get a fresh pancake and fresh sliced strawberries.  Yes you pay a little more but you get real honest food. If you want artificial flavors and overly sweet gloop on pancakes that taste like it came from a box then the Original Pancake House is not where you want to go.  Although the utterly decadent German Apple pancake comes close. For Pancakes like your great grandmother used to make go to the original pancake house.  The signature Dutch Baby or the German apple pancake are their signature plates.  The original restaurant in Salem, Oregon has a windmill as part of the building.  A place I used to go when I was growing up, the chain is still family owned and is as old as I am.  Go, enjoy you will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"I stopped in with my husband with on a Sunday around 2 pm for a very late breakfast. We were seated in less than 5 minutes and the server immediately took out drink orders.   This was my first time at this location but I ordered my usual, the strawberry waffle. The husband ordered the pecan waffle, farm-style sausage, home fries and a hot chocolate. The hot chocolate was quite cool because of the whipped cream so keep that in mind. Our server quickly replaced it sans whip and he said it was pretty tasty. Free refills on hot chocolate, BTW.   The food was out in less than 10 minutes - everything was great and on par with other locations."}
{"text":"So we came here based on the reviews and were not disappointed. The portions are huge and the pancakes are as good as described on their website. The only thing I will say is their kids menu is very small, only three items to choose from, my son ended up choosing from the regular menu and ordering a half order. The service was excellent, everyone was very friendly. The pancakes with bacon inside were unusual, but very tasty. I would definitely come here again on my next trip to visit family."}
{"text":"I have yet to have a bad experience. Don't be put off by the wait. It is well worth it!!! I'm sad to see the crab cakes Benedict are off the menus but I understand! I love their hash browns. I think they do them with meat drippings. They are perfect!!! Even as a non coffee drinker I like the coffee too!!"}
{"text":"Id give this three and a half if i could, because the waitstaff is so good. The omelets are disappointing, puffy and very very pale. I asked the waitress before ordering if the eggs for the omelets were out of the shell and she assured me they absolutely were. However the look was extremely uniform and as i said quite pale.  Like foam rubber. At  the check out i asked the owner/ host the same question. He was distracted  And when i said are the eggs for the omelets out of a carton, he said absolutely. Yes.. So. get the pancakes here.  Great variety and good."}
{"text":"They seem to pack you in when you have a large party. This is a problem since your order is multiple plates. DO NOT order the Crab Cake Eggs Benedict - there is far too much cheap fillers in their crake cakes. I did not care for having to pay as you head out the door, maybe since our table was near the register and the lines at times crowded our table. I found nothing to make me come back. Our waitress seemed to run past the table avoiding eye contact and was poor on checking back."}
{"text":"Our waitress forgot our order, there were no refills for the water, and the food was nothing special. IHOP has a better selection, tastier food, and much better prices. if they would show some concern about their customers, based on their brand name and history, I think this could be a great restaurant. However, as it lays, I would prefer to eat at Denny's over The Original Pancake House.  And I hate Denny's. Really, really hate it."}
{"text":"Atmosphere and first impression:  Stopped in Saturday morning around 11am. The place was busy but not too crowded. There were about 5 small groups in front of us. We only waited about 10 minutes though to be seated. The front desk, host, and waitress were all very nice. We were waited on promptly. Having reviewed the menu on the OPH app it didn't take me long to figure out what I wanted. The in house menu is very well laid out.   Food: I got bacon, eggs over easy, 3 blueberry pancakes, and coffee. My wife got granola, raisin, and shredded coconut pancakes with a veggie omelet. All the food was excellent. The blueberry pancakes had baked in blueberries with blueberry sauce (optional) and powered sugar. I added maple syrup. The texture, sweetness, and flavor were perfect. The bacon was amazing! Thick, flavorful. Some pieces were a little chewy but still good. My wife's veggie omelet was huge as shown in the photo. It had veggies and cheese inside. I'd  give the omelet a 4/5 rating.   The food portions are large from bacon, to omelets, to pancakes. I barely finished my meal and my wife could not finish hers! The coffee was excellent too.  Overall: The portion size, flavor, and price cannot be beat here. We got a ton of food for about $30. Forget IHOP and Eat'n Park. Do yourself a favor and get some OPH pancakes, waffles, French toast, crepes, etc.! (and no I don't work for OPH) The experience was very positive. We will be returning soon!"}
{"text":"Original Pancake house is one of my favorite place to go to for breakfast. The place is clean, the staff is nice, and the food is so amazing.   Located at Aliante Station off the 215 and Aliante. The Original Pancake house is one of the dining choices you have at Aliante Station Casinos. Even though it is inside the casino, its built to look like a house. The entrance way has a gated door and greeted with one of the staff members. Inside the Pancake House, its well lit, and the tables are laid out very nicely. A bit tight in a sense, but just enough to move around easily.   As for the staff, they were really nice and it seems like they really enjoy their job. After being seated, the waitress was quick to ask what I would like to drink. Since I already knew what I wanted, I gave her my order of Strawberry Crepes and soda. Of course one of my favorites would be the strawberry crepes. But from previous visit, I had many other orders. One of my other favorites is their Oven Baked Omelette's. The Omelette's itself is like eating a football. Its actually that big of an omelet. Even though it was good, I like the Strawberry Crepes more than the omelet.   Of course they were quick on the order, 10-15 minutes is enough time to make sure the food is cooked properly and served in a decent amount of time. The food was great, and the service was excellent.   This is one of those restaurants I would highly recommend. The only thing I don't like about it, is that its only for lunch and breakfast. It tends to close their doors around 3pm. But if you do go,  go when they open their doors, or go during their down time. Once they get busy, waiting time tend to be longer. I prefer to go when its not to busy. Mainly after the breakfast rush and before the lunch rush. But do keep in mind on the time you plan to go and expect service to slow down, when it does get busy."}
{"text":"My friend and I were in here this morning with our 10 month and 18 month old kids. We fed them pancakes and plain scrambled eggs (no butter, no syrup). There was a small mess on the floor as you would expect from little ones, nothing out of the ordinary. In fact, there was a half of a pancake, a fork and some scrambled eggs. Nothing on the table that wasn't on a plate. As we got up to leave, we were stopped by the owner, who told us we were completely disrespectful to not attempt to clean the \"mess\" on the floor and that now his servers had to clean it up. After a few more rude comments, he told us we were never allowed back in his establishment. Mind you, this was in the middle of a crowded restaurant with plenty of families with kids. Our kids were very well behaved, didn't even make a peep the entire time. Clearly this is not a kid friendly establishment, yet they have menu items specifically for kids. We were blown away by the rudeness of the owner and the one waitress cleaning off the table. Never ever will we visit this place again. G-d forbid an adult were to spill syrup on the floor, I can't even imagine what would happen!"}
{"text":"Stopped in here after The Little Gym class with my husband and daughter. The place is nice and clean and our waitress was nice. However that being said the prices were ridiculous. I received 4 small pieces of turkey sausage and they charged 5.00 extra and then an additional 2.00 for egg whites. My omelette with two vegetables and 4 small links of sausage was 18.00. The waitress never mentioned the up charges and we had to ask for the bill because we were so confused why the bill was so much. Aside from that they charge 2.50 per coffee. The prices are too much that I won't ever come back here. I could get just as good of a breakfast at Waffle House. The food didn't taste bad, it was a tasty breakfast homemade but the prices are insane. Thanks but no thanks. I will be just fine not returning again."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere and beautiful restaurant. Very reasonably priced. Pancakes were phenomenal, sourdough toast was great, but the eggs were a bit much ..... Not sure why one needs to eat 4 or 6 egg omelette ! But they were tasty too I suppose. Junior plates for the little ones is plenty! Quick polite professional service. We came from out of town and I wish there was a classy breakfast joint by us! A definite must for everyone."}
{"text":"I forgot how good The Original Pancake House is. Their breakfast is so delicious! My favorite is the strawberry pancakes which comes with fresh strawberries, whipped cream and house made strawberry syrup. Their omelettes are very good as well. Their portions are huge and prices are good.  Definitely worth eating @ Pancake House."}
{"text":"Pretty good place for brunch, it was pretty crowded but they got people in and out pretty fast. Good coffee, fast service, 3 pancakes with most orders. I had the daily special which I think was like an eggs benedict but with a sausage gravy over the top of the eggs, very good. Prices seemed a little high but it was all good."}
{"text":"I'm generally pretty patient and not one to complain (at least that's what I think, my BF may tell you something else), but we had the WORST experience ever here. The line for the buffet was ridiculous at 6 PM on Sunday night so we we to the Pancake House which was totally empty. Everything was fine when we placed our orders and got our drinks, but then we waited and waited and waited. Our waitress didn't even come by to give us an update. When we asked her what happened to our food she said ALL of these people are waiting for their food and gestured to the 3-4 other occupied tables as if the place was packed!  It seriously took about an hour before we got our food. When our food came we were informed that they had run out of french fries (wtf?!) and that we would be getting hash browns instead. First of all, how do they run out of fries when no one is there and second, their \"hash browns\" are really home potatoes. Sorry, I'm a stickler for details :) They must have also run out of hamburger buns because my bacon cheeseburger was on 2 pieces of toast!  Anyway, this was the worst restaurant experience I've had in a LONG time. Obviously something was wrong because no one else seemed to have had such a horrible time. In the end, I guess it kind of worked out because they heavily discounted our bill and we only ended up paying $12 for 4 meals."}
{"text":"Mom, Minda, Rica, and I went here around 10:45AM. It was pretty full, but we got a table quick. Mom: corned beef and decaf tea; Minda: basic pancakes and orange juice; Rica: Swedish pancakes and coffee; Me: savory crepe and coffee. Minda likes the orange juice because it has lots of pulp. My crepe was delicious. The coffee cups are cute. Mom and Rica like the lingonberry jam that comes with the Swedish pancakes. The menu lists calories for all the dishes, which is helpful."}
{"text":"Having traveled 400 miles to visit family and a hotel breakfast that should scare you we found this little place. Food was awesome especially the apple pancake, it look very assuming but was light and apple-y and the cinnamon sauce was to die for. Hash browns flavorful and delicious. My husband had the belgain waffle and was impressed to have someone finally make them light and crispy and tender as they should be. While our server that day was less than warm and fuzzy we let the owner know and came back a second day for breakfast again and service was spot on by our server and most all of the others we observed. Worth seeking out but it fills up fast. A Great breakfast draws a crowd!"}
{"text":"After a recent group breakfast here, I can not imagine returning.  We did have a large group, but not so large that it would explain the poor service.  We had to flag the waiter down for coffee refills, & even then, he ignored several empty cups.  One of our group had made a specific request regarding a serious food allergy, & when the food came out wrong, her polite request for a replacement was met with 2 managers visiting our table to try to convince her to accept the order as it was prepared.  What conscientious restaurant employee would knowingly risk an allergic reaction for a patron?  There are far too many great choices in the South Hills.  I won't return.  (I did like their custom pottery mugs!)"}
{"text":"This is the best breakfast place around however the oj isn't strained and sometimes the pull is so thick it's horrible.  They put a disclaimer that there's no refunds on the juice. That should tell you something.  The home fries and coffee are awesome. My friend swears by their omelets .  The blueberries are not fresh, they are a frozen type and they aren't good at all. They taste flat and not sweet..  Otherwise I believe their toppings are just canned fruit filling....I'd skip those"}
{"text":"I've been here a number of times and have mostly had good service and good food. It's in a casino though... which makes it less appealing to me as a destination breakfast spot.  Portions are gi-normous. You could probably share a plate with a friend if you're feeling cheap. Coffee is decent but I like mine stronger."}
{"text":"This place came highly recommended by a friend who had dined at a location in another state.  We thought we'd try it out.  We waited a good 30 minutes in the breezeway of the restaurant which was freezing.  Once finally seated our waitress must have been having a bad day because she was just shy of rude.  Everything took forever but we didn't mind waiting because we had heard it was so great.  I ordered a bagel with cream cheese; the bagel was burned and there was a hair in my cream cheese.  I let the waitress know and she simply said she'd get me a new cream cheese.  There was no apology at all.  There were 4 of us at the table today; 2 of the people got their food while the other 2 of us waited about 7-8 minutes for our food to come.  We had to send 1 of the meals back because it was very under cooked.  This went back via the manager-no apology here either.  When I ordered blueberry pancakes I didn't think I would be given a small side of blueberries from a can.  There were the same blueberries in the pancake.    There was a very friendly man coming around to clear plates; probably the friendliest person there but he took my plate before I was done and without asking.    We asked for our check to be split, the waitress said to let the cashier up front know when we went to pay.  When we got to the cashier and asked for the check to be split she acted like we were asking for her to do something absolutely unthinkable.  I thought about letting the manager know about the subpar food and the horrible service we received but he didn't really seem to care.    This is a place I would never go again and I regret waiting as long as I did for it.  Hopefully my experience was not the norm as I see a lot of good reviews on here.  But I wouldn't be willing to give it a second chance."}
{"text":"We were visiting from Los Angeles. Our host Tiffany made us feel so welcomed. The food was amazing and fast!  We ordered the Santa Fe omelet and french toast it was delicious! Totally recommend this little cute spot."}
{"text":"My friends and family enjoy TOPH very much.     They offer many options on pancakes (my guests ordered the buttermilk and chocolate variety).      I am a sucker for their omelettes.   You can go large (6 egg!) if you want.   I kept it small - the size of a chipotle burrito with some home fries.   Great Service / Great food / Good Price."}
{"text":"The place to go for breakfast!  We had just gotten picked up from the airport and our friend took us.  The place is impeccably clean, everyone one there truly liked their jobs.  We had a fantastic waitress, Diana, who knows her stuff and really takes pride in her job!  All the food was yummy and the portions were huge!"}
{"text":"Good food for brunch! Their food is not greasy as other places. The strawberry whip cream waffles is the best. Their whip cream is very light and fluffy and not too sweet. The waffles itself have some kind of flavor to it and a little crunchy. I'd ordered the eggs and sausage. Both were not greasy. It is located on the highest floor of the parking. That's a pretty nifty idea where people can go straight to it from the parking. Love the strawberry whip cream waffles. Will definitely go back there again."}
{"text":"I thought this place would be phenomenal. However, the omelet I shared with my mom was so cheesy we could not finish it. The pancakes arrived half burnt and not fluffy at all. The blueberry waffle had a ridiculous amount of thawed *frozen* blueberries on top (which are very unpleasant when eaten on their own). I can honestly say that I prefer Bob Evans' pancakes, waffles, and eggs, however I plan to give this establishment another try."}
{"text":"Fast service, great food.   I have had their oven baked omelette, oven baked pancake, strawberry crepes and waffles and they have all been delectable. Another plus is their waiting staff, they have all been very friendly and fast for coffee refills and overall service.   The only thing i don't like so far is their benches. They sink too far and make me feel swarmed. I recurrently take the sacrifice for their delicious breakfast carbs."}
{"text":"Well I've been here a bunch of times and they never diappoint. Love the atmosphere and the food is very large portions."}
{"text":"This place has simply amazing pancakes. On weekends there is often an hour's wait, but trust me, it's worth it. Although these pancakes are not cheap if you are looking for an upscale breakfast spot this may be just right.  Flavors range from traditional berry to bananas foster pancakes, toasted coconut, potato pancakes, sourdough, pineapple, swedish pancakes and more. They even have specialty pancakes, like the dutch baby that is oven baked and served with lemon and whipped butter, and an oven baked apple pancake that is fit for dessert.  I can't remember the last time I went anywhere else for breakfast and took home leftovers but here I always leave stuffed. The long wait on weekends (I'm told there is no wait during the week but I can never make it then because they have limited hours). It pays to be hungry. Once you get a table, the servers are friendly, fast and keep the coffee refills coming. There is also a large selection of breakfast meats, crepes and omelettes.   One warning, don't leave and go across to the B&N if you are waiting, if you don't hear them call your name you will lose your place in line.   Located in a little strip mall across from Eton place, it doesn't look like anything special and you could drive by a dozen times without stopping. But you'll be glad you did, this is probably one of the best kept secrets on the East Side."}
{"text":"I've been here several times now, a tradition in the making; we come to visit our friends, spend time with them, and the day that we leave we all arrive at OPH and enjoy some of their delicious food. The bacon is amazing and the pancakes are exactly how I like them.  We only visit the area maybe once every few months and yet somehow the waitress this morning remembered what I like, right down to the (bad) joke I told about how hot chocolate must always have whipped cream on it. Amazing service.  I've never had bad food here. The worst part is that I always over-order and overeat, right before I get on the road for a 6 hour ride home. I could fault them for breakfast food that's too delicious, I suppose, if I wanted to but really, they're a great little mainstay that I hope is always there so that we can continue this tradition in perpetuity."}
{"text":"I was underwhelmed by the pancakes at The Original Pancake House, but I love their bacon, which is cut thicker than usual and cooked so that it has a crispy exterior with still maintaining a very thin layer of a tender interior.  As for those pancakes, I got the Two By Four because it was one of the few (if not the only) combo on the menu with both eggs and pancakes.  The four buttermilk pancakes measured about 4 or 5 inches in diameter, weren't at all fluffy, and didn't taste any better than what one could get at Denny's or Bob Evans.  The environment is warm and inviting.  Service was friendly, though it wasn't very busy when I went in the early afternoon.  Some of the other patrons were straight out of National Lampoon's Christmas Vacation (\"Grace!?  She passed away thirty years ago!\").  Overall, I definitely wouldn't make the trek over to the east side just to have breakfast at The Original Pancake House, nor would I really stop by while I was over there just to have some pancakes.  That bacon, though, might just merit a second visit."}
{"text":"We struck out big-time here. We were introduced to the original \"Original Pancake House\" in Portland, where this chain started. The breakfasts there were sublime. The breakfasts at this outpost were at the opposite end of the spectrum. We shared a Denver omelette, that was 50% more cheese than egg. Not only that, it was tiny and hardly had any veggies or ham. They charged us around $9 for this omelette. I'll happily pay that much for an omelette at the original OPH in Portland, because they are delicious and have more eggs than cheese. The chocolate pancakes were OK, but how can you not have excellent choco pancakes? This is a no-fail recipie...  It's also good to know where to park. This seemed like it was hidden in the back corner of the building, about 1/2 mile from our car. I hope there are closer parking spaces than we found...  (I originally posted this review for the other location of this place in Las Vegas - my error)"}
{"text":"I love the 49er flapjacks.  They were served fresh and hot.  The waitress was attentive."}
{"text":"It was hard to find parking on Sundays. The atmosphere is really nice but noisy. It reminds me of the waffle house but more elegant. You have to wait to be seated which took around 15 mins. After we sat, the waiter did not come for like 5 mins. When she came, we were ready to order. We had to wait around 30 mins for our food. The food was good but I was disappointed in some of the dishes such as the fruit crepe. The crepe was soggy and salty. Service is OK. The waiter did not come to check on us until we were done eating. The prices are reasonable."}
{"text":"I was really craving biscuits and gravy so I decided to check this place out. The young lady who took my order was new, but she was very pleasant on the phone and let me order take-out since they weren't busy yet (normally no take-outs allowed on the weekends). Orders here are pretty large and well priced in my opinion because my $6 meal included six buttery bottom grilled biscuits and two cups of sausage gravy. Simple, but tasty. I would order this again!  On another occasion I tried their breakfast Mexican burrito and this baby is large! I want to say the cost was around $10 and the burrito included toppings like salsa, sour cream and half an avocado. Taste wise it was just okay, no dance party for your mouth, more like something to stuff you for a Sunday afternoon coma while binging on Netflix.   All in all, it's a decent affordable place that I would probably check out again. Just a heads up that it gets busy fast on weekends so you might have a wait if you come in during peak hours."}
{"text":"according to yelp, 5 stars = \"woohoo! as good as it gets!\" i am going to add: \"woohoo! as good as it gets - IN CLEVELAND!\"  so yes, i give the original pancake house 5 stars because it takes a small chain to provide my favorite meal of the day to people in this midwest town.  but i must say, the menu makes me go crazy because they make every single kind of pancake you can think of! and i just want to get them all!  it also doesn't hurt that this restaurant is across the street from anthropologie. *wink*"}
{"text":"The Original Pancake House is a staple in the community. 3 small buttermilk pancakes come with many of the meals. What's not to love?  The food is generally good for brunch. I like the omelets, which are \"rolled,\" meaning their cooked in a skillet and finished off in the oven. They're generously portioned and can easily be shared. Their omelet options are pretty standard  (e.g. ham & cheese, western, veggie). For an up-charge of  $1.39, they can also be made with egg whites.  Their breakfast meats are pretty good, but pricey. Their \"Daily's Bacon\" is pretty nice--thick cut, slightly chewy, slightly crispy, salty enough--but is over $5 for four strips. The other meats are right under $5. Their \"healthier\" meat option is turkey sausage, which is not good.  Their pancakes are obviously their stars. With many, many options to choose from, your bound to find something for you. I like their 49er and Dutch Baby.  I will say, though, their pancake batter (from which most of their pancakes are made) is pretty basic. There's nothing that makes it distinctive, like Meyer lemon juice or even more buttermilk. It's good pancake, but I'm left yearning for more.  The staff is generally friendly and checks in on you.  However, on the weekends, you can expect to call your server once or twice because of how busy it is. Also, the wait can be lengthy on the weekends. From 10:30 a.m. to 1:30 p.m., expect 30-45 minutes for a party of 2-4.  If you're looking for a good brunch place that's reasonably priced, come here. They've got something for everyone and it's and old standby. However, Cleveland is full of great brunch places, so I strongly encourage you to venture out because you find anything on the OPH menu elsewhere that's tastier and/ or reimagined."}
{"text":"Ate here on a Wednesday morning with two of my kids.  We were seated immediately, and our server was prompt and very friendly.  Food was pretty standard, and the pancakes are definitely the star attraction here.  I had the corned beef hash, and was warned that the price for eggs would be a dollar more than listed due to the bird flu that is going around.  Well, I didn't get the bird flu, but the corned beef hash was on the dry side.  Not a bad option for breakfast, but not a place you'll be running back to for another visit."}
{"text":"Don't ever order huevos rancheros  they don't know Mexican.  No way Jose' slop sent back ."}
{"text":"The food is amazing if you go on Sunday they are busy as hell you'll need to bring your patience"}
{"text":"Food is always good but bad service will ruin the taste of anything. They get so much business that a few dissatisfied customers here or there don't hurt the bottom line. No real consideration for our experience. Another place to take off the list where I'd like to frequent!"}
{"text":"What a great restaurant, the service has been well, the food has never failed us,, the the management even comes out to greet you once in a while,, excellent service been there around five times.. We will still come back we recommend this place to everyone.."}
{"text":"I met the family here for breakfast the other day, and it was alright.  I'm generally not a huge fan of chain-y places, but this experience was one of the less soul killing ones.  I ordered the pumpkin pancakes and a side of bacon with an orange juice.  The portions are gigantic-to an almost ridiculous extent.  I mean, I have a good appetite and even I can't eat 6 pancakes in one sitting.  But the pancakes were delicious.  The bacon was phenomenal-you get 4 huge thick slices of bacon when you order it as a side.  It was fantastic.  The orange juice was fresh squeezed, which I enjoyed.  My brother got an omelette and it looked good-you still get three pancakes when you order an omelette, so maybe that is the way to go.  Overall, the food was good, but the atmosphere just felt so generic.  I also saw several of the different types of pancakes and didn't like that when you order banana pancakes, it is just pancakes topped with bananas, the same with chocolate chip.  I think they'd do better to bake the ingredients in.   Overall, good food, okay environment.  I would go here again if the family was eating here, but I'm not sure I'd go out of my way."}
{"text":"Too bad their pumpkin pancakes are a seasonal item. I'd order them all year long.  The place is definitely kid friendly with a noise level to match. Service couldn't be much better. It was better than many top tier restaurants. Their omelets are a bit different,  more of a shuffle. Very fluffy and light. The coffee is excellent. The North Hills location is a bit off the main drag, but is worth the effort."}
{"text":"Busy breakfast spot with unique offerings, the Original Pancake House is worth it if you are not in a hurry and are a breakfast fan."}
{"text":"Drove out of our way to go here for a good breakfast, based on the good reviews I read about it on the net.  Was not impressed at all though;  the pancakes were decent, but the eggs and sausage I tried were mediocre.  I also was excited to try their 'signature' Apple Pancake as it sounded delicious, but I was greatly disappointed.   It was huge, but very blah, could barely taste any pancake at all really.  Didn't enjoy it much at all, and on top of that, everything was expensive considering it was just breakfast food, almost as much as we'd pay for a nice sit down dinner!"}
{"text":"I was pleasantly surprised by this place. My husband was craving pancakes so we decided to stop here for Sunday brunch. My first impression was how clean and updated the place was. Not like most breakfast spots that are greasy or outdated.   The menu had a large variety so everyone in your group should be able to find something they'll like. My husband struggled to decide on pancakes and I opted for a traditional breakfast. I can't remember which pancakes he ordered but I know he was glad he only ordered the short stack.   The service was friendly and fast. We'll be making this a family breakfast spot for when my husband and son are craving pancakes."}
{"text":"This place is really good. The breakfast menu is very big and everything is very good. If you go on weekends expect to wait. Their omelets are pretty amazing and huge! The pancakes are legit which is expected. Overall it is tasty but pretty pricy."}
{"text":"Wow.  I'm salivating as I am typing this...  This place is just that good.  At least for breakfast.  Their OJ is freshy squeezed.  Portions are generous.  I had the Eggs Michael.  It's poached eggs with a mushroom sauce and potato pancakes.  The pancakes in my photo look burnt but it's good.  My friends had no complaints.  Their omelette's were insane and must have at least 6 eggs in there.  Don't be put off by the long line outside.  It moves quickly.  Our party of eleven was seated within 10 minutes once we got to the front of the line."}
{"text":"The service is awful. I have had experience as a waitress and know that mistakes do happen - especially when it's busy! However, if I had wanted to be ignored and have some bad attitude along with my morning eggs, I would have just saved the $40(!) and eaten breakfast at home with my neighbor's grumpy cat. Then I could have not only enjoyed a less expensive breakfast, but I would have also had easy access to condiments and beverages - free of eye rolls (god forbid I ask for a water after I finish my orange juice). Good gracious, OPH, just put ketchup on the tables so we demanding customers do not have to put your staff through the emotional torture and physical agony of having to get us some! On the bright side, my eggs were cooked perfectly and food is always decent."}
{"text":"Me and my hubby loved it! The belgian waffle...the omelette...blueberry pancakes were fresh and tasty. I would go there again.  Edit: we go here most every weekend :)"}
{"text":"We come to the original pancake house every time we come to pittsburgh. The food is always good, the place is very clean and the staff is super friendly. Today when we were there the manager heard our daughter getting upset because there was no more marshmallows on the smores pancakes we ordered for her and our son to share. The manager out of nowhere came over to our table with a little bowl of marshmallows for her. Then before we left he stood and chatted with us and gave both our children a pack of Oreos. They make you feel welcomed, not rushed and the food is on point. If you get there early in the morning you will have a wait but it is never really long. We got there at 11am and the place was not very busy, quite and the food came out very quick."}
{"text":"Popular breakfast/brunch spot in the area, and being unimpressed by the nearby Bob Evans and intrigued by the somewhat unique menu, I decided to give this place a shot. There was a 20-25 minute wait on Saturday at 11 AM, which is to be expected. Atmosphere and decor is what you'd expect. Typical hustle and bustle of a busy brunch spot. One thing I thought I was kind of cool was that they had art on display along the walls from local artists that you could purchase if you were so inclined. Service was great. Attentive and very friendly.   Onto the food though, I ordered *deep breath*:  - Biscuits and gravy - Delicious. Gravy was good with huge chunks of breakfast sausage. The two biscuits were nice and buttery but not as flaky and puffy as I had hoped and just a little bit dry.  My favorite dish out of what I ordered. - Seafood omelette - This was HUGE. I would guess their omelettes are at least 5 eggs. Inside was crabmeat and shrimp, outside was hollandaise sauce and few leaves of spinach. I could have (and have) made this omelette myself. The sauce was good, and there wasn't enough spinach. Disappointed overall. - Banana pancakes - Thin and dry, with an almost overpowering banana extract flavor. Very disappointed. - Dutch Baby - This is what I came here for. They give you a side of lemons, powdered sugar, and whipped butter. USE THE LEMONS. At first I tried a piece without the sides, and it really didn't taste like much of anything. I was expecting crepe/elephant ear, but all I got back was a very mild flavor with a squishy \"soggy french toast\" like consistency. I squeezed the lemons and lots of powdered sugar, then it started to taste good. Still not enough to warrant the hype IMO. I had to drizzle syrup over it to really enjoy it.  Yes this was all mine. $30 for breakfast. I finished everything except 3 of the 4 banana pancakes. Yes, I'm a pig. Our server commended me and even let the manager know. Friendly staff.  What others in my party ordered: - Corned Beeef Hash omelette - HUGE. Not enough corned beef, and potato chunks were too big. I could have (and have) made this better at home. - Pecan pancakes - Decent, nothing special. Not really pecan \"infused\". Just pancakes with pecans.  Miscellaneous... their orange juice was fresh squeezed and definitely tasted like it. Very good.  I would go back again to try a few other things on the menu, but I doubt I'll be a regular patron.  First Watch is much closer to me and tastes better."}
{"text":"On our way out since the nearest Pamelas was closed due the Labor Day Holiday we drove here. I ordered the kielbasa and pancake platter and it was really good. The coffee was terrible though, and the waiter had add as we had to keep repeating what we wanted."}
{"text":"Fan freaken tastic! I have been to the original pancake house by disneyland before and have happily stuffed my face with all kinds of goodies. This time it was a different visit. The low carb life style and the original pancake house sound as if they wouldn't mix well...  But they mixed very well. We both ordered the four egg bacon and cheese of your choice ( I picked gouda) omelette. Yes it does take a while to get your plate but it states on the menu that they bake their omelettes so expect a 18 - 20 min delay.  They arrived perfectly cooked. So fluffy and stuffed with so much bacon. I was in heaven.   Service was spot on. Refills arrived promptly and fruit substitutions weren't a problem. When visiting green valley ranch this is the place to stop for breakfast (or brunch depending on how crazy the night before went)."}
{"text":"Over priced to have terrible service and smell of food when u leave! So do this.. Buy better ventilation or better one and get new servers and don't make me wait 30 minutes for a half order of pancakes on a wend afternoon when there isn't anyone there! Won't be back !!!"}
{"text":"Great place, Nice location, nice clean restaurant, good food and usually we have good service. Personally i enjoy this place during the week. On the weekends it can get a little crazy and loud beyond what is comfortable for chatting. Also their menu prices go up on the weekends. You pay more for the same food depending on the day lol. I have never seen another resturaunt do that."}
{"text":"Diane the sever is the Best!  She is Very Attentive, Nice and is a good person to talk too.      Food is Great, Pancakes are Amazing..."}
{"text":"We are never disappointed by the food or service in this cheery, clean, welcoming place. Bottomless mugs of great coffee and delicious breakfast entrees keep us happy and coming back. Our favorite menu items include blueberry pancakes, vegetable omelette, and the famous Dutch Baby. The bacon and turkey sausage are delicious. Food is always hot, fresh and served in generous portions. Perfect spot for a weekday brunch, if you are lucky enough to catch time for that. Gluten-free and health-minded options are plentiful enough to bring the hearty with the nutritious. This is the nicest location of the several Original Pancake House restaurants we have visited around the U.S. Be sure to check out the original artwork throughout the restaurant."}
{"text":"Yes I've experienced it better. Compared to the Original Pancake House located in Rockville, Md---this Woodmere location was a disappointment.  I usually get the Apple Waffles--I was very disappointed with the amount and the way the apples were prepared compared to the Rockville location. The orange juice sizes were different and cost more than Rockville.   You would think bc it's a chain --it would be same. NOPE.   Service: ehh it was alright. Kind of slow."}
{"text":"Best breakfast ever.  Best omelets best bacon. Great coffee.  The best breakfast ever."}
{"text":"My wife and I come here often. They have good food and it comes out quick. there portions are huge. Omelets are normal 4 or 6 eggs. There pancakes are soooo good. when I eat here I don't actually get hungry until dinner time"}
{"text":"I've been to this chain before and had great experiences, but this location does not live up to the others. The wait staff looked like zombies walking around - no smiles or personality. Our waitress would ask us a question (if we needed anything, if we were doing alright) and then turn to walk away before we even started answering. The food was mediocre. I was disappointed by this location and I'll try somewhere else next time."}
{"text":"Delicious fluffy omelette and tasty potato pancakes. Server was very attentive. Wish there was one closer to where I live!"}
{"text":"AMAZING breakfast food, but keep in mind, you can only get it until about 2PM or 3PM :( Unlike IHOP, this breakfast food is fresh, homemade, and tastes wonderful...  You can get eggs, bacon (which is bigger than the plate), homefries, and three pancakes for about $7...it's SO good!  Sometimes there's a wait but it goes fast, and it is totally worth it. Try this place if you're craving some strawberry pancakes, because that strawberry sauce they make, IS TO DIE FOR :)"}
{"text":"I wasn't crazy about the corned beef hash. But I do recommend the coconut pancakes, which come with an awesome tropical glaze. I got a taste of Darren's Crabcakes Benedict and they were scrumptious. The service was great, our server was adorable and talkative, and overall, they serve good breakfasts here.   Just be careful. Their lot can be impossible to get into. try to go on a weekday morning if you can. We tried coming here a few times before and could not find a spot."}
{"text":"I'm a fan.  Even though it's not in the city, and thus, not convenient for me (though, hitting up the mall after a Saturday brunch could be the recipe for the perfect day...)...it was right on par with Pamela's and DeLuca's (ooooo...did I just say that?!?).  I had the apple cinnamon blintzes...OMG amazing.  I had expected the cheese inside to be less cottage cheesy and more cream cheesy, but the taste was there nonetheless.  My side of sausage put my calorie total for the meal probably more than I care to know, but I enjoyed every single bite of it.    My husband had a western omelet, which was the size of...no...BIGGER THAN...your face!  He also thoroughly enjoyed it and had enough to take home for another whole meal.    So many delicious and tempting options - we most definitely are going back because I want to try so many more things.    The only thing I can only slightly complain about was the waitress seeming impatient with us not leaving.  I met old friends for breakfast and yes, afterwards, we sat around and talked for about 20 minutes.  My mom was a waitress full-time (and so was I during college) so I understand the idea of table turnover, especially around breakfast time when meals are cheap, tips tend to be bad, and the fast table turnover is the only redeeming quality of working morning shift.  She seemed a bit pester-y though as we were sitting around, and kinda made me uncomfortable.  I did leave her an amazing tip though, for greedily taking up her only 8-top at peak breakfast hours."}
{"text":"The food was decent but not worth a trip back. My problem was with the waitress/host who seated us. She was loud and rude! We had a large party and added 1 more person and that just made her flip out she was loud and almost yelling \"well is it 10 or 11\" I wanted to leave but we had a large party and my husband said stay calm it'll be ok. DO NOT try to go there if you are with a group. One person in our party of 11 was stuck in traffic they refused to seat us until everybody in our party was there. We finally just said she's not coming in order for them to seat us. The waitress was annoyyed prior to us getting there. Overall foods ok but service stinks! I wouldn't send or refer anybody there."}
{"text":"Excellent breakfast!  Where to start, first this location is nice, new and big.  It's located inside Green Valley Ranch Casino.  I love Henderson and this area very modern and new.  This restaurant is best enjoyed in a large group because there is so much to try and share.  On our last visit we had omelets, honkin big, delish!  We also had the strawberry crepes, outrageously delicate and hearty all at the same time.  The best item for me though is the Dutch Baby, how to even describe it.  Its this huge puffed pastry with a crepe texture that is served with powdered sugar, lemon and butter.  So beyond yum that it brings a tear to your eye.  I recommend the vegetarian omelet with gouda cheese.  The Santa Fe one also looked good with tomato sauce and cilantro but I couldn't try it, too much food!  Wait there's more, the potato pancakes with sour cream and applesauce are awesome and the pumpkin ones too.  Too many dang choices and so little stomach! I heart u OPH!"}
{"text":"It's all about the bacon, really. When we take guests to the \"Original Pancake House,\" in our minds we're really taking them to the \"Awesomest Bacon Ever House.\"  It's always a slight disappointment when a friend declines to taste the bacon.  Then we realize that it's okay, because that just means more bacon for us.  OPH has a long history of excellence. It was just one restaurant in Portland, Oregon when I was a little girl, and I remember the Sunday morning lines that stretched halfway around the building. But we kids never begged to go elsewhere because inside a Dutch Baby awaited our patience. I remember the place having lots of pancake flavor choices, and that memory is certainly not faulty! A full order of pancakes is six generous discs, starting with the simple buttermilk variety and going all the way to bacon pancakes. That's right, you can have bacon pancakes with a side of bacon! There are also crisp, fluffy waffles, serviceable crepes, and an assortment of omelets and egg choices - all of which come with a side of three pancakes. On a four-top table, this can get pretty crowded, but we always seem to manage.  This is a lot of food. Come with a big brunch appetite, and don't expect to eat again until a light snack before bed. And do come early; they are only open for breakfast and lunch.  The restaurant is airy and large, so even if there's a line the wait generally isn't too long.  The staff is friendly and helpful, and most of the time coffee and water gets refilled regularly. It's not the cheapest breakfast in town, but it's one of the tastiest.   And there's bacon. Yummy, yummy bacon...."}
{"text":"This place should be called the best place on earth to eat delicious pancakes that will make your stomach crave more and more. I enjoyed just about everything here. It has a very simple elegance to the interior. Not over done and almost too plain but somehow it works.   Interior: As I said above, its plain and simple; very easy on the eyes.   Service: I enjoyed the frequent coffee refills. I had close to 3x more than my usual here and I was wired like Tweak from South Park. The food came out quick and the servers were friendly.   Food: They serve a typical 'breakfast menu' but its exploding with options. They have a large variety of pancakes and breakfast meats to choose from. They seem to be great with pancakes and breakfast meats, however the eggs I saw seemed to have sat in the air too long and turned a grey color. The pancakes are like a dessert to me. They aren't fluffy but more dense and like a fluffy cake. Its very delicious. Each meal comes with 3 6in pancakes so you definitely get your moneys worth here.   In the end you will leave here feeling like you ate 10 bowls of Wheaties and still be a champion. I plan to return on Sundays."}
{"text":"Being a traveler and compared to the other major cities that I've been in, the breakfast was actually very well priced for the quality.  I love how their menu allows you to build your own plate to some degree since many items are broken out individually.  I went in mid-week and was quickly seated.  However, most importantly...the bacon quality is really really outstanding."}
{"text":"This is by far my favorite breakfast spot to go to whenever I visit home. I go here all the time with my family and we always enjoy ourselves. We usually go on Sunday mornings so its usually very packed. We always have to wait but its normally no more than 20 minutes. It's definitely well worth it. The servers are great and do a great job of making sure your taken care. Its kind of small inside and you feel stuck in a tight box, but other than that this place is awesome"}
{"text":"This place is pretty disgusting. Anywhere that sells eggs with fluorescent yellow yolks really turns me off!  Crepes and pancakes are below average and very low quality. Service is rushed and unfriendly.  I really don't understand how this place gets so packed! Definitely not worth a visit!"}
{"text":"Best breakfast in Pittsburgh in my humble opinion. Wait on the weekends gets long but it is so worth it!   Love the pecan pancakes- fluffy pancakes with pecans in them and more on top. The dutch baby is a huge double layered pancake that is crispy on the edges and then puffy and soft/ almost chewy in the middle. It comes with lemon and powdered sugar to make a glaze in the center and it's delicious. Presentation is hilarious- it comes out straight from the oven before the center has fallen- it's huge! The 49er flap jacks are good too they are thin like a crepe and again crisp on the edge.   The bacon and sausage links are both good. Typical diner coffee that they refill when you've only just started drinking it. The homefries are soft and oniony- perfect with copious amounts of ketchup.   Ore servers have always been good. Friendly and efficient."}
{"text":"The Original Pancake House made a very good first impression. The eggs were cooked right. The bacon is really thick and cooked to crispy perfection. The sausage is the size of hamburger patties. The corned beef hash is made from scratch, and was really tasty! The other diners I was with had the crepes, the french toast, and the pancakes, all looked great!   I might not be in the area very often, but this is a place worth checking out. I will definitely try the crepes next time."}
{"text":"I can never finish my whole breakfast here!!   They usually have a wait early in the morning so get there as early as you can becoz they don't seat you til your whole party is there! I've tried their Santa Fe Omelette which comes with red/green salsa on top! It complements the omelette very well!  The omelettes also come with buttermilk pancakes! The portions are ridiculously large and for the money...its pretty worth it!  I enjoy coming here..especially when I feel like having carbcakes for breakfast!"}
{"text":"Pretty good Breakfast.  Staff was ok.  I was seated quickly.  A large variety of pancakes, waffles, and omelets.  The pancake orders are huge.  I happen to have the bacon waffle.  O so a waffle with some bacon. NOOO. A waffle with bacon INSIDE.  I would say the elements here combine for an above average breakfast. a 3.5, but well, as you can see I am incapable of 3.5."}
{"text":"We love coming here for breakfast!  We have pretty much always stuck to pancakes, so I do not have the most broad prospective.  We have had blueberry, pumpkin, chocolate chip, and chocolate & peanut butter chip and have never been disappointed.  I tend to lean towards getting the 1/2 portion because of how large the portions are.  They do not take reservations or call ahead seating.  So, be prepared to wait.  They are normally very accurate with their wait times.  Also, they will not seat you unless your party is all there (which I am a fan of because it really does keep everything moving.)  Once you are seated, we have never had an issue with service.  Service has always been efficient and prompt.  The coffee is delicious and I would highly recommend it.  We normally get a side of bacon, and yes it is on the pricy side for bacon, but it is not bulk packaged bacon either and, in our opinion, worth the few extra dollars.  You pay at the counter and the girls there have always been very courteous."}
{"text":"This is a chain that I'm pretty sure is new to the Pittsburgh area.  Mercifully this was built right behind the Denny's.  If you go to Denny's instead of \"The Original\" for breakfast, you're a moron.  Portions are definitely big. You might be just fine with a short stack.  Who doesn't love chocolate chip pancakes? If you get sick of them, try the chocolate chip waffle!  The \"Dutch Baby\" intrigued us for a while.  We finally tried it and were underwhelmed.  The Apple Pancakes are awesome though."}
{"text":"Every time I come here, I have to remind myself: please order pancakes for the love of God, your are in the pancake house! And you, please, do the same. Pancakes here are out of this world good: every sort and kind you can imagine including crepes and some german buckwheats, rare breeds among tastless generic fluffiness of American pancake world. Here is why I have to remind myself; besides the calorie counting and the annoying \"couch potato\" award popping up on my cell phone every morning ( turns out I was supposed to be running at night according to some heartless android app) omelets here sound amazingly good. The problem is they are made with 6 eggs and baked in the oven, so usually they bring out the very accurate edible replica of Everest mountain made out of eggs. Also omelet baked in the oven in my opinion just stops being an omelet and becomes a challenge. This is when I give up digging in my mountain, and after a deep sigh,steal half of my husband's pancakes. That's why please order your own pancakes. For the love of God and the marriage.  When in Rome, do as Romans do."}
{"text":"Eh... okay. Not great, but not bad. The omelettes are obscenely large... that's not a compliment! LOL."}
{"text":"We were starving and had to rush for the long drive back to Detroit and then a flight in the afternoon.  So no time for my usual \"Dutch Baby\" - highly recommended!  Since that takes an extra 10 minutes we both had waffles with fresh strawberries - the waitress super-efficient and friendly.  Very rapid service and YUM."}
{"text":"My favorite breakfast place in LV / Henderson.  Located in GVR - Green Valley Ranch.  I have yet to experience the potato pancakes prepared like OPH, anywhere else.... Outstanding!"}
{"text":"Good, but not amazing. Bacon was way too thick and fatty - I am more of a thin and crispy person. Their pancakes are delicious,  just as one would hope as it is in fact 'The Original Pancake House'. Reasonably priced, and a very clean venue.   Honestly I feel this may be one of Pttsburgh's better venues to go to for breakfast or brunch... they don't seem to have a whole lot else. Going here is worth your while for a tasty meal that is priced right."}
{"text":"This place is good for certain items. The dutch baby is my favorite. If they are busy you have to be prepared to wait for a dutch baby. My husband has tried a few other items and they have all been decent."}
{"text":"If this location is seriously closed, or even moved, I would be greatly disappointed.   I have always wished they had longer hours of operation. And before I discovered Babycakes, I always put these pancakes as the best in the valley.   Many a time we have patronised this establishment. Always found it bustling with other patrons. Eggs are bit over*priced if you order them à la carte. In fact, everything might be over*priced à la carte, so just order your pancakes and go on your way.   Pancakes themselves might have been somewhat over*priced; hell if I remember. They were ultimately tasty though, that is all I know. Service was always on-point.   Again, unfortunate if it was closed or moved, because I do not remember there being much around here, although I notice now there is a WaffleS Cafe a bit South of the overpass. - E"}
{"text":"Excellent experience today.   Although my husband ordered the 49er and didn't care for them, plus they weren't cooked all the way. They remedied that quickly and his second choice, apple waffle was good.   I had the bacon pancakes, which were yummy!!   Our waitress, Lindsey, was awesome!!   I would eat here again!"}
{"text":"The 49er flapjacks are something special.  The extra thick bacon is wonderful and always cooked as it should be."}
{"text":"I smell...bacon!  Yes, I know this place is called Original PANCAKE House, but have you ever had the bacon here?  To borrow from Jim Gaffigan: \"I never feel like I get enough bacon, at breakfast it's like they're rationing it.\"  Well, if that's the case, come to OPH and order the bacon lovers plate.  7 strips of bacon on one plate.  Yes, 7!  All the meaty, greasy, bacony goodness your arteries can handle.  And these aren't your typical Farmer John, paper-thin slices.  We're talking s-l-a-b-s of pig.  They have other things on their menu, such as, oh, I don't know...pancakes.  The pancakes here have gotten thinner and not as fluffy as they were a couple years back.    The dutch baby is always a winner, but isn't quite filling enough for me on its own.  Unfortunately, after you lather it up with butter, it's almost suicide to add a side of bacon, so really, why even bother?!?  I have a hard time ordering anything here that doesn't come with a pound of bacon (can you tell?)."}
{"text":"Great breakfast place! The German Pancakes are awesome and definitely worth the wait. This place can get pretty busy, so wait times may be long and service may not be so humble and prompt."}
{"text":"Ok what else can you say about this place but wow! I've been a number of times and other than I little slow service when they are slammed busy... the food  is great! .I am a fan of the Georgia pecan pancakes, they hit the Spot everytime!..... and the bacon is sooooo tasty. My wife gets the Dutch apple pancake and can't get enough."}
{"text":"Met up with a few out of town friends for brunch at this spot and was pleased with the food.  When we got there there was a 20 minute wait, but we may have waited less than 10 minutes before being seated.  I ordered scrambled eggs and sausage patties and a side order of pancakes (be aware that side orders come with 3 pancakes...I would have been content with 1!).  I only had one of the pancakes because that's way too much food for me but I will say the pancake was delish.    I can't say the same for my husband's blueberry waffles.  Rather than have the blueberries cooked in the waffle batter they were thrown atop of  a waffle.  While this may not have been a problem if the blueberries were fresh (they weren't, they were frozen) or in the least bit sweet (they weren't and barely edible) my husband took off all the blueberries and ate them without it.  I get that it's not blueberry season so there may be an issue with getting fresh blueberries, but tossing inedible (still cold/partially frozen) blueberries on to an otherwise decent waffle makes it worse.    I would suggest sticking with their pancakes or getting a plain waffle.  The eggs and sausage are good, but not sure how those can be messed up!."}
{"text":"restaurant is closed and not open for business anymore."}
{"text":"Ive seen this place on the hill for several years, but it was only after seeing a coupon in the clipper mag that I decided to try it.  I will never go back again.  Then coupon clearly stated \"everyday specials\" and went on to list a combination of breakfast plates to choose from.  While waiting for my table (30 min after being quoted 15 on a Sat morning) I had decided which of the everyday specials I wanted, only to be told by my server that the \"everyday\" specials were only Monday -Thursday.  No place on my coupon listed that detail.  I asked to speak to the manager.  He came.  He was rude.  He said \"I'll make an exception just this once but next time be prepared to pay the correct amount\". This was pretty embarrassing given I was with my 3 children and he made me feel like I was asking for some type of concession when all I was doing was redeeming my coupon.  I stayed, I ate, I was further disappointed.  I asked for egg whites and was warned \"I would have to pay extra for that prep\". The tiny juice that was priced at a premium, and although was \"fresh\" tasted awful. My plate included 2 pancakes that were about 3 inches in diameter, and whoever made the batch went way to heavy on the vanilla extract, they tasted kinda metal, I really wasnt impressed with the flavor, and neither were my kids.  When my check came, the $4.50 plate cost me $7.99.  My server said it was because of the egg whites.  I expected $1 more tops, given the chef had the daunting task of scooping out the yolk from 1 egg, not the forfeiture of the concession the manager had offered me 30 minutes prior.  Even without the lackluster flavor, rude manager, and fraudulent advertising, the place felt pretentious; I wish I could further describe that, but it was just a feeling I got from the time I walked through the door.  It was kind of like trying to be some exclusive alternative to Bob Evans or something."}
{"text":"Very good breakfast. We'll be back! Had Mexican Benedict and wife had Irish omelette. Was our first time trying here."}
{"text":"Was busy, we were quoted a 25 minute wait. Can't do anything about that. We ordered and got our food quickly. Gone in 60n seconds. I was starving. It was delicious"}
{"text":"Took 10 minutes for someone to come to our table. One adult and 3 kids under 10 = $50. This is not inexpensive! Service was sssssslowwwwww. Bacon and eggs were good. Not worth the price."}
{"text":"Very popular restaurant. I took my girlfriend and we had to wait about 20 min to get seated on a sunday morning around 10 o'clock. It was great food. The meal cost about 10 per person but the amount of food was more than enough. Tables are very close to each other and its kind of a community breakfast not a whole lot of privacy. My waitress who i believe name was Sarah the blond women was delightful. Ill most likely be going back another time."}
{"text":"Original pancake house relocated to the old grand cafe. Much of the vast space is unused and takes away from the quaint thoughts of breakfast.   The menu offers it all: crepes, pancakes, waffles, French toast, benedict, and so on. Prices are fairly high but not unexpected for inside a lovely hotel like GVR.   Started with coffee and o.j.  The coffee was superb. No complaints. Well, they don't have flavored creamer or lattes or anything.... The o.j. was clearly fresh squeezed and extremely pulpy.   I had eggs Michael. A rendition of Benedict with sausage patties and a mushroom sherry cream sauce. Really good. Eggs cooked perfectly. Seasoned nicely. Piping hot. 4 crispy potato pancakes on the side with sour cream and applesauce. Lots of food! I would have preferred toast in lieu of 2 potato pancakes so I could mop up my yolky cream sauce goodness.   Hubby had corned beef hash. Although it showed close resemblance to the magical canned version, it lacked fat so, therefore, was a bit dry.   $32 for 2 coffees, 2 breakfasts and 1 juice. $38 with tip. A bit steep for breakfast but satisfying nonetheless."}
{"text":"Everything was excellent. And let there be a lesson to all restaurants that serve good contacts---syrup makes good pancakes great!!! Had to wait 20 minutes but it was a Sunday morning so whatever. People were moving fast. When we ordered service was super fast. Daughter loves the pigs in the blanket and the eggs Benedict with sausage gravy was out of this world. You will not leave hungry that's for sure. Wish it was closer to home."}
{"text":"I've been wanting to review TOPH for awhile and on my fourth visit I figured it was about time. Hit or miss on other visits, my fourth time was here was the kicker.   First, the place doesn't look like a pancake house. With a little more wood paneling, this place could be confused with a steak house if you weren't aware of where you were. Beautiful light fixtures hang from a high ceiling, and high, wood framed archways welcome you into the restaurant. Easy listening music play softly in the background.   I looked over the menu and decided on a short stack of buckwheat pancakes and a cup of coffee. For those of us worried about caloric intake TOPH lists calories for each meal (sans syrup) and a short stack (3) of buckwheat is 560 calories. Pancakes are my comfort food, my indulgent meal.   The cakes were hot off the griddle, steaming and just a little undercooked in the middle which added to their tenderness. The syrup added the sweetness needed and complimented the  the buckwheat pancakes to a tee. Did I detect a touch of cinnamon in the syrup or was it in the batter? Who cares, it was delicious. The coffee was nothing special even though  the menu exclaims it's award winning and they sell if on premises for home brewing.   The place is overly noisy, no acoustic absorbing ceiling tiles to keep the customer's conversations from bouncing off the walls. For convenience, at the bottom of the bill they give a gratuity calculation or 18 or 20%. Way better than Eat N Park, Denny's and King's, my only issue is the parking lot, smallish and way undersized for a restaurant this size. Avoid this place on a Sunday morning, as I'm sure it's packed to the rafters. My bill was 8.56 for three cakes and endless coffee."}
{"text":"I'm sad that someone else got to say it before me... someone who has stolen my name, by the way... but...  Bacon Pancakes FTW.  If I had a dollar for how many times this \"conversation\" has happened...  \"So get this... there's bacon IN the pancakes.  Perfectly sized chunks of thick cut bacon.  IN the pancakes.  Like, mixed into the batter and... oh, you get it?  Oh. You looked confused.  Sorry, your confused face is almost the same as your impressed face.  Yeah, you can eat the whole breakfast, pancakes and bacon, and never set your fork down.  It's completely outrageous.\"  I've seen these 80-pound omelets whiz by my head on a server's platter and I remain wholly unimpressed.  Anywhere else, I'd be scheming to get someone else's omelet.  \"Hey, guy, you drive a silver Audi, right?  It's being jacked... oh, excuse me, miss, I think that's my omelet.\"  But at OPH?  Whatever.  Omelet Schmomelet.  Five very perfectly sized pancakes (at OPH, there is no \"my pancake is bigger than your pancake\" bravado because they win on taste), arranged nicely on a plate, and syrup.  What else do you need?  Coffee.  Some of the best around.  Why not?  I mean, you're already getting a little glimpse into heaven as you eat bites of pancake WITH BACON IN IT... why not reach out and touch Jesus' robe real quick?  Can't hurt.    In the fall, order the pumpkin pancakes (which are dusted in powdered sugar... and garnished with whipped cream... nice touch!), but make sure to convince someone you're with to get the bacon ones because you'll need a little taste to stop the shaking."}
{"text":"Definitely go here if you love pancakes! They have some great combinations, and the portions are enormous. I'm not huge on breakfast sweets but I still very much enjoyed my Swedish pancakes, and I thought it was cool to try something different besides your typical chocolate chip or blueberry hotcakes. We were in and out of there pretty quickly, but we did go late on a weekday morning so I'm not sure what the wait is like during peak hours. I really enjoyed their coffee as well, and the restaurant was cozy and I imagine would be perfect on a chilly winter morning for breakfast."}
{"text":"I work in the same strip as TOPH and my coworkers and I are frequent visitors. I love the pecan pancakes. I always get bacon on the side, so the salty-sweet combo is in full force. Add some coffee in the mix and I guarantee your day will be made. Chocolate chip peanut chip pancakes are for breakfast or dessert and the biscuits and gravy are made just like grandmas."}
{"text":"I know.....I know what you're saying.  I can already read your mind.  \"ITS A CHAIN!\"  Yes, it is a chain.  It had the chain feel, the vibe, the questionable servers, the generic interior...but guess what?  It didn't taste like a chain, and that's allllllll that matters.  It tasted like homer simpson just bit into his favorite pork rinds or donuts or chocolate strawberry vanilla ice cream...mmmmmmmmmmm, or uuuhhgggggggggg, or whatever descriptive non word sound you want to use to describe the deliciousness.  Listen, what chain squeezes their own fresh orange juice?  are you kidding me?  it was unreal!  The portions are huge, but it's not about quantity over quality.  The taste is overwhelming.  The presentation is excellent.  Your eyes will be just as impressed as your stomach.  Trust me, give it a shot....look at some photos, do a little research.  I promise you that you'll be pleasantly surprised and satisfied enough to return...."}
{"text":"This is an excellent place!  Were traveling and made a plan to only eat at places that are original to us, and not eat at them more than once while on the road.  But we have to admit, this was the only place we broke our own rule with and ate here twice!  I tried the crepes and chocolate chip pancakes (on separate visits).  The portions on both were HUGE, so I would recommend getting 2 single crepes and a side of pancakes if your not starving enough to handle a huge portion.    He had the coconut pancakes and swore by the orange jelly (I think it was a jelly) that came with it...and the bacon was amazing (I stole a piece from his plate each visit).    The only think that was confusing was when were there on the weekend we had the check paid at the table, however when we were there on a Monday (in a rush no less) we didn't know to pay at the register...we tried a few times to flag someone down until we found out.  If this is a weekday rule, it may be helpful to let people know. This by no means is a weighing negative, just a suggestion."}
{"text":"We were just there, a group of four 20-somethings, and had so much delicious food at reasonable prices. Our server, Diana I believe her name was, had a wonderful attitude. She really brightened the mood beyond where it already was, and the overall experience was excellent! Too bad I'm from out of town, otherwise I would come by regularly."}
{"text":"I had great experiences the last few times I have dined here, I split the scrumptious green tomato omelet giving 75% of the omelet  to my dining companion and order with an up charge of three dollars I consume three good sized bacon pancakes. The chocolate milk is a little pricey for it size being around 6 ounces of tastey chocolate milk and they serve quality coffee.  Sometime the service is a bit spottie but they always get our breakfast  quickly and the kitchen is expedited quite well.  I'd say this is a good place for business meetings aND family meals."}
{"text":"Really great service along with some great breakfast.  I kinda wished they would be open in evening especially with my late night pancake craving."}
{"text":"A truly great breakfast.  The Dutch Baby (a huge eggy pancake cooked in a Dutch oven) was great, hot chocolate was extremely sweet but that fit well, one friend was floored by the bacon pancakes, although another thought the waffles were underwhelming.  The line is super-long, though.  Deservedly so, although I wish they had those remote-control things that ring when your table is ready.  That would make it easier to wait in the bookstore across the street.  Also wish they were open late.  I'd ditch IHOP in a heartbeat."}
{"text":"I take back my comments about rather going to denny's on 150th. OPH redeemed themselves a bit with their pigs in a blanket plate.   One key tip is to make sure you go before the sunday church crowd gets there. We went at 8:30am Sunday and it was empty."}
{"text":"Whenever we go there on Saturday, they tell us it will be a 20 minute wait.  Usually it is not.  No matter the wait, the food is excellent.  The Sausage gravy and biscuits is well worth the trip and the Dutch Baby is fabulous!  Be sure to order the special bacon.  If you are getting regular pancakes, you can get a half order.  Omelets are all huge so you can eat half and know what you are having for dinner."}
{"text":"I stopped here with my wife on a Sunday afternoon for a heavy brunch.  Having been to the Original Pancake House in the south hills, we had a general idea of what we would be getting into.  Overall, the place is a bit more disorganized than the one in the south hills.  Upon arrival, we put our names in to the host and were skipped over several times before having to approach the host where our names were accidentally crossed out. He was apologetic and he seated us right away.  The menu here is simple.  Mostly breakfast foods and an emphasis on pancakes! If you have a sweet tooth it's definitely worth checking out.  The food all looks very impressive, especially the pancakes.  However, my wife and I satisfied our sweet tooth with a very creamy hot chocolate first.  Would highly recommend trying their hot chocolate here, definitely a step above the rest. I ordered eggs southwest style with home fries and my wife had something similar. The home fries weren't nearly as good as I remember them, and one of the potatoes was under cooked. The eggs were still just as good and I ended up bringing half the meal home for later.   Overall some pretty good breakfast/brunch food with a young, energetic, and disorganized staff.  Definitely not opposed to coming back here however.  They do make some pretty awesome breakfast combinations."}
{"text":"Don't judge a book by it's cover.  The Original Pancake House flanks the end of a strip mall and sounds like a chain. While that may be the case, it just doesn't feel like a chain for some reason. Inside it is cozy, cheerful and clean. It's always packed with locals and the service has always been great.   The menu is extensive and portions are huge. I've been here multiple times and each time I go, I try and order something new. Everything on the menu looks amazing and I haven't been let down yet."}
{"text":"We were so hungry...I think anything would've tasted good!  LOL!  But everything was good.  My favorite is their baked omelets...we were in a hurry so I didn't have time to wait 18 minutes while it baked. As expected...pancakes, eggs and bacon were all good.  Coffee was average.   I was a little disappointed to see they were getting rid of the military discount.  I would be curious to know why they aren't going to have that anymore.  A 20% discount is minimal considering the service they provide to our country.  Also, every time I've ever been at Aliante, it is crawling with service people.  It would seem to me, it'd be a better marketing strategy to get those large groups of people in, rather than not.  I'm sure it was an incentive to have them come in...without it, Aliante will just be another casino and the Original Pancake House is just another place to have breakfast.  There's plenty of places to choose from.  Ie:  The Cannery.....very service person friendly, and pretty sure it's closer to Nellis."}
{"text":"Nothing crazy good. Food is kind of bland. Orange juice is great though! The crepes are better than the pancakes in my opinion. I've had the German potato pancakes, smores pancakes and a few different crepe dishes. The Dor Stop restaurant in Dormont has better pancakes."}
{"text":"This place looks awesome. The smell of the maple syrup blasts the air while you wait on line to get in. Granted, outside of Vegas(ahem, Henderson) I am pretty sure their is no line.  The food, well it is not that great. It certainly doesn't inspire me to come back and try other menu items. More or less inspires me to wish I hadn't paid so much for the food!  Like so many national chain stores, great look, great concept. Just no real delivery of something worthwhile. It also tries to play the 'Olde Fashioned Game' with locations nationwide and corporate reps throughout the business...its about as old fashioned as the Casino that its in."}
{"text":"Wow, what a disappointment. We drove 6 miles to have breakfast here and we were greeted by waiter body odor, sticky menus, dirty coffee mugs, dirty silverware, nasty carpet, and loud as hell intercom muzac. This is nothing like any OPH I've ever been to. Pretty bad."}
{"text":"After recieving a dirty coffee cup , the owner/ manager gave me defense attitude.....like it was my fault.when my food dropped there was a long and big piece of hair in my Dutch baby.........again they asked if I want another( I'm thinking No I like foreign hair in my food)..........at the end my family finished before I even had my food and I would assume they would want to at the very least pay for my horrible breakfast.......The Answer was No! And we don't care if your a decent customer who comes in a lot.......we don't care if you come back.............to the owner or person who called themselves an owner......you suck as a restaraunteur"}
{"text":"Bought takeout. It was very bad. Haven't been back since. Came back to eat because a friend wanted to eat here. Pancakes have a peculiar taste. I don't get why it's so busy. Extra star is for the service. I won't be back."}
{"text":"I've been here a handful of times over the span of a few years. They have a huge breakfast menu, and also a lunch menu. The lunch menu is mostly sandwiches and wraps. I love the decor inside and everyone is always friendly. The location is behind Denny's all the way up on the hill."}
{"text":"Just as we sat down a young male waiter yelled at the hostess and made a scene RIGHT IN FRONT OF US! that we were sat in his section, she herself ended up taking care of us and I'm glad she did. However, I totally understand there is a system, we were one of three people sat in the section and he was waiting on one party of the three. I get this is a chain and for what it's worth, it's good breakfast food. My finicky boyfriend was very pleased with his eggs Benedict.   I'll go back as long as that guy isn't my waiter. I had view of kitchen and saw his attitude through out the whole time. It was dissapointing. I work in the food industry and understand situations and attitude, there is no excuse for his behavior, at least take it away from view of your customer."}
{"text":"I couldn't tell you the last time I ate at The Original Pancake House, but my boyfriend and I decided to give it a go when we were in the mood to go out to breakfast. We dined on a Sunday morning around 10:30. And, surprisingly, it wasn't busy.  We each enjoyed a glass of fresh squeezed juice (a big plus). He ordered orange juice, while I ordered grapefruit juice. I thought it was a bit strange that the menu notes \"No Returns\" on juice. Seriously? People have tried to return their juice?  For our meals, he ordered the eggs benedict with potato pancakes and I ordered the apple waffle with a side of whipped cream. To my surprise, the whipped cream is legit - no cool whip here. He quickly devoured his meal, while I made it about half way through my portion of waffles. Overall, the food was good, much better than nearby iHop or Bob Evans."}
{"text":"The food was great!  That's where the great ends. The restaurant wasn't too clean. Yes they were busy but dust on things around the table that wasn't wiped in a very long time and wait staff wasn't very friendly or very good. Our waitress literally brushed the plate across my head as I was leaned towards my husband as we tried talking in an overly loud establishment. She could of announced she was there with our food but instead brushed my head with the plate. She also said a Dutch baby is like an elephant ear and that couldn't be further from reality unless real live elephants ears tastes like this but the carnival elephant ear has no resemblance to this. This tasted just like French toast to us. We were so disappointed in it until I tried the lemon juice on it and then it was a whole better experience still not an elephant ear. My husband's plate had dried food on it but after the super long wait and this being our 2nd attempt at a breakfast place he didn't say a word. Waitress refilled his water glass with warmer than room temperature water. I tasted it it was nasty warm. The bus boy seen the waitress had gave us our bill and stood staring at me waiting for us to leave and I wasn't done eating he finally left when I made it clear I was eating. Then the rude man at the register he never says a word to us no how was your meal no kiss my butt no have a nice day no thank you nothing. However a nasty dirty look when I got myself and my husband a toothpick. I said to my husband is something wrong he said I don't know. He's running my credit card I guess. So after we pay the man handling money along with a girl who handles money goes back to wrapping silver wear in napkins. Have you ever seen how dirty money is and in today's laws with health I can't see that being allowed now. Anyways we left and enjoyed our food completely but beyond that we wouldn't desire to return because this place doesn't seem to care before or past the food in our experience."}
{"text":"Day-um. Everybody knows that a good breakfast is the true cure to a Sunday-morning hangover. So I hit up this place with some pals in order to satiate my craving for salty-sweet belly-stuffing goodness. And I was really pleasantly surprised. This just may be the finest diner breakfast I've ever had on the West Side. Pancakes at most places are an afterthought: a rubbery, tasteless puck of nothingness that's simply a vehicle for butter and syrup. Not at this place. The stack of pancakes (that come gratis with pretty much every order) was, as I said earlier, the damn finest I've had within five miles of my apartment. The omelette I ordered was pretty hellaciously large as well. So I will definitely be back. If you get there at around 11 on a Sunday, be prepared to wait. You can walk around the strip mall and check out the dozens of fart-themed T-shirts they have at Five Below."}
{"text":"One of the best breakfast places in the area. The home fries are my favorite, and there's tons of choices for pancake, waffle or French toast. Pro tip: ask for Diane's section, she is the most amazing waitress and she will take good care of you!"}
{"text":"The food is delicious! It is expensive for breakfast food and the service isn't very good at all. We will go back for the food alone and hope all of the staff is friendlier next time. $30 before tip for 2 people is pretty expensive."}
{"text":"This place has some good Pancakes. I like fast breakfast, I.e. Waffle House but you can not compare the both. If you have time this is the place. There should never be a speedy breakfast, an these guys are great with the quality of the food."}
{"text":"We have an Original Pancake House in my home town. Same food, but way more expensive in Green Valley Ranch in Vegas. Next time I'm hitting the $5 breakfast buffet and saving the additional $45 it cost me for 3 entrees, 2 small glasses of OJ, 1 glass of milk and a cup of coffee."}
{"text":"If you are used to quality ingredients cooked with care this is not the place for you. Pancakes taste like batter and the omelet ran a river of butter when I cut into it.  But if you are one of the masses who enjoy quantity over taste or health you'll love it."}
{"text":"if u enjoy north face coats,  Iphones, and beats by dre then you will absolutely love this place.  The over inflated prices for a decent breakfast fit right in with all your other lifestyle choices of seeking a pretentious identity. The one dollar sign next to the name needs to be changed."}
{"text":"We love the food here, but not always the service. Most of the servers are nice, but they have a couple cranky ones. Hate that, because we eat here at least twice a month. The food is always good though. Our favs: cherry crepes (yum!!!), bacon pancakes, their bacon itself (awesome), strawberry pancakes, 49er flapjacks (yummy.. like fat crepes), banana pancakes and raisin pancakes. Mom lets us have decaf coffee here too, and it is good."}
{"text":"Best breakfast ever! This location is better than the west side location. If they own them both, the website side location needs help. The service was not good and the food was cold and undercooked. I will eat at the chagrin location only now."}
{"text":"I am such a fan of this establishment!! Though I get the same thing almost every time, chocolate chip waffle/pancakes and bacon, they are consistently delicious. And I love the whip cream that they use!   The bacon is thick and flavorful. The chocolate chip waffles/pancakes are sweet and soft.   I crave this place and sometimes even visit there alone. It's that good.  The menu has so many different options from which to choose. The omelets are huge, and come with pancakes. The building is large and even if there is a wait, it isn't long. It's definitely worth waiting for! They also have a rewards punch card for weekdays only that'll earn you a free meal upon completion."}
{"text":"Dutch baby was delicious. Probably worth a trip for that. Corn beef hash was good, but somehow the table next to us gets a whole heaping pile of the stuff while ours was tiny. A little overpriced for what they gave us, maybe the table next to us would have felt better with their huge pile of hash. Based on the food alone, though, I might return.   BUT... the service was a joke. Our waitress didn't give us silverware. She seemed annoyed at having to bring us stuff. She was mostly gone (not be found when we needed our check), but when she was around she made strange and awkward small talk all while doing a poor job of pretending to care. Ugh, fire that lady!  On another note, what kind of breakfast place won't cook eggs to order? They only serve scrambled."}
{"text":"Go to the one in the Green Valley Ranch Casino instead. Which is along the freeway to the Mc Carren Airport."}
{"text":"This place is literally three minutes away from my house. I went for brunch with my family.  Their selection of pancakes is huge. I wasn't feeling too adventurous, so I just got strawberry pancakes with whipped cream.  SO GOOD.  They came with warm strawberries, marmalade, and maple syrup. The strawberry syrup was my especial favorite... its kind of like really delicious, warm, liquidy strawberry jam.  I was happy with my food and would go back for it. My mom got eggs, potatoes and pancakes and my brother got the French Toast with banana and they were happy with their food, too!"}
{"text":"Food is good, and very generous portions.  They have great pancakes and GREAT omelettes!  Definitely a place not to be missed!"}
{"text":"YUM-O to this place.  line was long my first time here but SOOO worth the wait!.  i had this tropical pancakes with pineapple and tropical syrup....while i dont regret my choice, i wish someone at my table would've ordered the dutch pancake...my goodness those were huge. only thing i would say is that for most items, you need to pay additional for the breakfast sides...too bad this isnt 24 hours!"}
{"text":"Great food, great service. My kids loved our server Bethany. She was attentive and very nice. The location is convenient with lots of stores. I will recommend this place to my family and friends. The Southern Eggs Benedict is amazing.  Seee ya next weekend!"}
{"text":"Chocolate chip pancakes were amazing! No need for syrup.  Bacon pancakes are as expected, a wonderful achievement of the modern culinary movement.  For everyone complaining about the parking lot, grow a set. It's a hard right turn, get over it.  Service was excellent. Management watched over like a hawk, and greeted all patrons."}
{"text":"A Pathetic, Disturbing Experience  Such a pity, I'd rather be providing good marks to the restaurant at risk. However, the insincerity and lack of managerial tact (including corporate response) knows no bounds.  I would have loved to review my meal here in a positive light, however, it's not every day you have your worst ever restaurant experience. Unfortunately, moments after being seated, my newborn (three weeks old), wife and I walked out after being threatened and insulted by the owner.  It occurred on September 26th, 2012, at about 11:45 AM. I walked into The Original Pancake House in McIntyre Square off of McKnight Road, the house 90% empty. Literally, it was my first meal outside of our house since my newborn arrived, three weeks earlier. My wife and I attempted to get out for the first time since her traumatic surgery, complications giving birth to our first, a daughter. Oddly enough, the restaurant service experience gods punished me, for some ungodly reason.  While walking in, I noticed a man (quite well-dressed) casually looking at seven patrons in line, in no hurry to seat anyone. It turns out the man was Chuck, the owner (I'll get back to him later, he was completely insincere, threatening and as the experience developed, an utter joke and mockery of a restaurant owner). He assumed that we were in some larger party and we weren't. Wait time to be greeted, 15+ Minutes (remember, the establishment is 90% empty). Strike One.  After a few waiting patrons had been seated, I questioned a waitress on seating availability. She asked us if we were waiting to be seated in a \"Party of 16\". I said, \"absolutely not.\" She walked away and failed to return. Mind you, we're still waiting. An additional 10 minutes of waiting before we're finally seating. (remember, the establishment is still 90% empty, if not emptier at that point). Strike Two.  After finally being seated, Chuck, the owner, attempted to apologize. However, this was done in a very nasty manner, with quite the attitude and tone. At that point, with a hungry new mom and cranky baby, I had experienced enough, we walked out and inexplicably Chuck was barking at us on the way out the door, with me questioning his anger and approach. I told him I'll not be back and he said, \"GOOD, I DON'T WANT YOU BACK!\" He was yelling at me in front of my wife and newborn. This is completely unacceptable behavior from any restaurant employee, let alone an owner / franchisee. Strike Three.  Like any good follow up process and knowing I'd receive little satisfaction from contacting the same owner, Chuck, I decided to call the corporate office in Oregon. After speaking to corporate for nearly 20 minutes, whom were disinclined to acquiesce to any of my requests (apologies and compensation for bad service), I've come to realize the extent of this clown outfit. Additionally, I found corporate to be just as rude as well, in that he presumed the basis of my anger stemmed from sleepless nights. Actually, this couldn't be further from the truth. Our newborn sleeps well and sleep hasn't been an issue. Assumptions / presumptions are the mother of all, you know what's (I'll keep it clean). A puppet and puppeteer, in on the take together and at the expense of the consumer, quite the incestuous business relationship, I should say.  The most ridiculous thing, and anyone reading this with even the most basic understanding of social media and reputation management, corporate management barked that social media was unimportant to them. I threatened them by telling them that I'd take this socially. I wonder if they're reading this review? I'll be sure to post it to as many restaurant review sites, as possible, not just Urbanspoon, but Yelp, CitySearch, etc. Don't forget Facebook, Twitter, etc.   Accountability is important in today's society. This specific establishment needs to be able to learn the importance of just that, accountability. Surely, they lack accountability on all levels.  Needless to say, I didn't care much for either of their attitudes and the entire dining experience, if you can call it a dining experience. Avoid this location and any of their locations, at all costs. We went to a competitor, down the street, for far less cost and so should you. Tu es le pire!  Buon Appetito!"}
{"text":"Parking: is a problem, but mom parks in the handicapped spot.    Mom says this place is hidden behind Denny's.  She's been here before but remembered it when she was driving down the hill.  Mom refused the menu because it was overwhelming, and it unfolds like an accordion.  Mom really really likes the Sour Cherry Crepes.  Mom loves the cherries and next time she's excited to try the homemade whipped cream.  She refused the whipped cream today because she assumed it would be out of a can.   Mom says she will ask for her cherry sauce on the side next time because she would like for it to be more tart.  Perhaps she'll ask for a lemon?  She likes the flatware.  She says it's not flimsy."}
{"text":"An old favourite, great breakfast menu, consistent quality, never disappoints. But. No hot water to wash your hands in the washrooms. Which begs the question, how clean are the cooks hands???? Eeeewwwwww."}
{"text":"Average at best.  I am pretty sure that my buttermilk pancakes, potatoe pancakes, eggs, and sausage links were not cooked enough.  Granted, I recieved my food less than 3 minutes after I ordered but I would have been okay with waiting another 2 minutes for a completely cooked meal.    My mom's pancake recipe is much better anyway..."}
{"text":"Service from the owner ( woman) was terrible. She was rude, waitress made a mistake and she said it wasn't a mistake because we didn't have our food yet.  Won't be back nor will my 150 employees. All over from homefries. Idiot!"}
{"text":"You'd be hard-pressed to find a better breakfast. I guess everyone in this town knows it too. The wait was 45 minutes and worth every second. I ate at one of these in Chicago and loved the place. This one even blows that one away.  I LOVE places who make gluten-free waffles, pancakes and french toast for those of us who rarely get to eat them. This place had several GF items to choose from. I got coconut pancakes. So good I thought I'd died and gone to Heaven. I also got a side of fresh, wonderful scrambled eggs with the best Pico de Gallo I ever put in my mouth. So fresh, so wonderfully spicy. The bacon...thick cut and cooked to perfection. You could taste the care that went into this breakfast. The coffee was delish and the mugs are so cute and whimsical.  The place was decorated beautifully and clean enough to eat off the floor. While I was eating, the owner came by. He spoke with me a bit and I got a real sense of how much he loved his business and cared about every plate served. Super nice guy. The service was impeccable, even though the place was packed. With the stress of so many people and the wait, still everything ran like a well-oiled machine. The host was friendly and funny. He did all he could to make the wait more pleasant. My server, Sandra was a dream. Friendly, helpful, cheerful. I felt so at home here and the food made me happy from head to toe. I HIGHLY recommend."}
{"text":"eh. it was okay. nothing special that really jumped out. service was nice and quick though."}
{"text":"Not a big fan of breakfast food, BUT everything I ate here was actually VERY good! I had strawberry pancakes, sausage patties and a bowl of grits.  However, I will be hesitant to return because of a few things:  a) The place is small and the wait can be quite long. We went on a random Thursday around 11 am and, despite it not being very crowded, we waited 20 minutes for a table...  b) Service....was pretty bad. After waiting, we were not greeted by our server for another 10 minutes...  c) Cleanliness: Our table when we were seated had not been properly washed. I also witnessed loys of crumbs/mess on the floor beneath other tables. They appeared to be using a bissel to try to keep up with the mess, but it was not pleasant to see as a diner.  d)Long Wait for Food AFTER Ordering   Use this information as you will!"}
{"text":"Love their oven baked apple pancake...so much brown sugar and apple-y goodness you don't even need syrup. Also delicious bananas foster French toast. My husband got the oven baked meat lovers omelet and really enjoyed it--very fluffy! The thick cut bacon was sadly too well done, that's the only thing that wasn't perfect. You will probably have at least a little wait if you're coming on the weekend."}
{"text":"The food is good but I was a bit turned off because of a hidden fee of 50 cents for carry out. They could have mentioned this during my order."}
{"text":"It says something about a resturant when on any given time during the weekend this place is packed out the door. This place is definately on my favorites list.  During my pregnancy I craved their food so pretty much made the resturant my second home for 9 months. There food is amazing. I usually get the Reese crepes.  The orange juice tastes like it was freshly squeezed right before it is brought to the table and they never let your coffee cup go empty.  The management there is so sweet and accomidating.  I have had mostly great servers with one exception. I don't remember her name but I discretely paid for a man's meal sitting next to us who was dining alone. I even left her a tip on my cedit receipt. After he left she came to our table and said that was really nice of you but can you believe he didn't even leave me a tip... I was highly offended but  that's the only time I've ever had a negative experience in the 4 years I have been dining there and one server is not going to warp my views of the company as a whole."}
{"text":"This place is the bomb...by the locals, for the locals.   As noted, it will be packed to the gills on weekends. Line is out the door and around the corner. Since I worked odd hours when I lived in the area I would only really come by during the week, as you could roll right in and get a seat (but it would still be busy...just not overflowing). Everyone, from the host to the bussers, are extremely friendly. The place just oozes a \"family\" vibe, and for a breakfast place, that is what you want.   The food is fantastic, too...especially the Dutch-inspired options. They offer a wide variety of pancake choices, with more toppings/fillings (is it considered a 'filling'? I don't know what else to call it) than you could try in a year. Buckwheat, baby! But, if you just want the ol' bacon and eggs, those are done very well too. The bacon in particular is way above average.   Its not cheap, but all things considered the prices are more than fair. If you are in the area you need to stop by."}
{"text":"This place is awesome!  The only downside is that next time I am going to have to remember to not eat for 3 days prior to arrival as the servings are HUGE!  The staff was very friendly, the place is clean and nicely decorated, and the prices are very reasonable considering how much food you get.  They had a special the day we were there of deep fried bananna nut bread; and I now truly believe that anything can be deep fried and made into a delicious eating event.  Lots of tables and space and even the wait when crowded was no more than 30 minutes.  We are looking forward to going back."}
{"text":"I would think a \"Pancake House\" would have a good size \"pancake\" to serve. The pancakes that came with my order were super small!  I ordered their omelette which came in the form of a football. (Kinda fat) It was slabbed on a plate with no garnish which didn't look so appetizing. Surprisingly it tasted ok. We ordered a side of hash browns which tasted so bad that I had to return them and cancel the order completely. It was bland and had an aftertaste. Service was horrendous, there weren't enough settings at our table which took forever to get more, cream for our coffee wasn't given till our coffee was cold, and they are cheap on napkins!... Overall, overrated and not impressed."}
{"text":"Sure, there's a wait, but once you've eaten there you really understand why. I really love this place for breakfast. I'd give it 5 stars but I had a weird experience last Saturday. I ordered a strawberry Belgian waffle and a kids chocolate chip pancake. (Hey, be nice, I couldn't decide what I wanted and Mom said to get both so who am I to argue?) The waitress asked if I wanted whipped cream. Yes, I said, on both. She brought out the food but nothing had whipped cream on it. She realized and brought me a large side of it but it wasn't the same. The heat of the breads is supposed to melt it a little bit and make it moist but these were *seriously* dry. The strawberries were yummy but \"dry\" as well (which is fine-- they're not supposed to be wet-- but it didn't help the dry waffle/pancake problem.) It was a little weird smearing the cream on after the fact, but whatever.   The ham and cheese omelette my mom got was fantastic, as was the orange juice. She also said the coffee wasn't bad, for restaurant coffee. I wish they had skim/fatfree milk!!   Still I love this place!!"}
{"text":"On 10/13/13 the young black female hostess was rude when  I questioned  why  a party was seated who came in after me. I. Told the manger who was wearing a Denver Bronco football jersey about her attitude, he seems to have not care about my complaint.  The food was good, but would not return due too the poor customer service."}
{"text":"Tried these guys again this past weekend. Takeout at work, same as my last review. Seems like nothing has changed. They are not prepared to do takeout orders, I suppose, because the pancakes were folded in half in a tiny takeout container. They were much chewier than they should have been, with a texture that (though I hate to say it) reminded me of pancakes reheated in the microwave when you've made too many at home... which is a pity. They're a pancake house, I would expect amazing pancakes there. The bacon was the best part of the meal."}
{"text":"Went here on a recommendation and was impressed with the portions.  We ordered the Eggs Benedict, Green Chile Omlette, Dutch baby, and potato pancakes.  Everything was great except the potato pancakes. The potato pancakes were soggy, missing onions and missing flavor, overall disappointing. I'd definitely go back to try more but avoid the latkes.  Service was quick and polite."}
{"text":"To all gluten free people.....  There is GLUTEN IN THEIR SAUSAGE PATTIES But not the turkey sausage links.  They make PATTIES themselves and add flour to it so it doesn't burn when cooked.   Their Maple syrup is considered to be gluten contaminated. But they say their flavored syrups are gf And they have a no sugar syrup they can give u. It has some chemicals in it that we normally avoid (like carmel and sorbate and artificial flavors etc.) so we bring our own syrup.   We came the first time and we told the waitress that my young boys have issues with gluten.  She told us nothing we ordered had gluten (eggs, sausage, gf pancakes, syrup butter) and we had issues. Ugh. Second time the different waitress was educated enough to inform us.   Aside from that the food is amazing and the food portion is huge. Avoid on Sunday's after church bc this place is Jam packed with a relatively small parking lot (sadly due to Scott township laws about not excavating hills)"}
{"text":"This place had very good food!! I guess the fact that it is situated adjacent to the casino without a wall separating the two might have been a good idea for someone but the cigarette smell was a downer. The service was average to poor...they didn't seem like \"people\" people & did a bad job acting as if they were...However, the job got done & everyone is ok. I just don't like to feel like I'm bothering the person that's getting paid to serve...take away the smoke & the reluctant waiting staff and this is a 4 star place. Oh and I wasn't happy with the prices...I guess you can charge whatever you like if each location makes its own pricing...smh"}
{"text":"If you can find a spot in the lot, then give it a try. The building is pretty neat, and the prices are reasonable. I had an omelet with American cheese (it was a Friday in Lent, so I can't speak for the meat); they make each omlete with 6 or maybe even 8 eggs, and it fills up the whole plate. It was excellent, as was the fruit salad. I wasn't feeling the love from the pancakes or the coffee, however. The coffee was extremely strong, so that's fine if you like it that way, but I don't. There wasn't really anything wrong with the pancakes, they just weren't anything to write home about; they had a bit of a burnt taste. Because of the omelets, however, I'd probably pick this place over a Denny's or something.   Word to the wise: map this place before you come. We came from McKeesport and went through all of the South Hills, and it ended up taking us about an hour and fifteen minutes to get there. However, it ended up being maybe a mile from the Greentree Rd. exit on the Parkway West, so we could have been there in 35 minutes had we taken that route."}
{"text":"What a shame this place is apparently not what it used to be.  I had to get rid of my original 5 star review from 2013, and write an updated one based on my family's very dissapointing visit today.  Where to start?  Both our coffee cups were slightly encrusted with what appeared to be either food or something else on one side (dishwashing soap?), but we didn't say anything.  My daughter's apple juice had some kind of visible black speck floating on the top, so she got another one.  Things got worse.  My wife's pancake had a clearly visible hair sticking out of it.  She was so grossed out, she didn't even want anything else, but they brought her some toast anyway, but 15 minutes later.  My pancakes tasted 'way off', and were not even remotely tasty, as they were in my previous visits a while back.  Plus, they gave us warm maple syrup, which tasted terrible.  Who the hell warms maple syrup?  Is this a stupid Midwest thing?  But worst of all, I thought my western omelette initially tasted OK, but when I got home a few hours later, I felt very sick.  I've had nausea and diahrrea the past hour and a half or so, and I feel weak.  I've had nothing else to eat all day today, so clearly my reaction is to what I had at TOPH."}
{"text":"The building itself seems to be renovated from an old house, awesome atmosphere. The staff was friendly and our waiter was great! Food was outstanding, we got the blueberry pancakes and an apple cinnamon waffle. Both were light and fluffy, nothing was too sweet. Both dishes featured real fruit; the pancakes came with extra blueberry sauce and the waffle with warm apple syrup. Portions are generous without being overbearing, at least for the short stack. The best part though, real maple syrup!"}
{"text":"I adore this place. I came home for a surprise visit during the first big snow of the year in November and on a whim decided to head out of the hotel into the frigid snowy cold and grab a huge breakfast for myself and a friend. I was cursing myself for doing that when I saw the 5 inches of snow that had to be cleared from my Georgia car that had yet to be equipped with a snow brush or ice scraper (oops) but once I stepped into the cozy warm Original Pancake House and started chatting it up with the owner-it was definitely worth it. We talked it up for a bit and he greeted all the morning customers with a huge smile. I didnt know he was the owner until I tried to tip him on my way out with my takeout order and he refused the tip. Made me feel happy to be back at home.   Now on to the food... oh the delicious pancakes, eggs and my lord the bacon. Thick perfectly chewy but crispy on the edges bacon. I haven't had bacon that good in forever. The pancakes were incredible. I got pumpkin pancakes fro myself and some cinnamon apple topped pancakes for my friend. The portions were huge. We had enough for breakfast and a small lunch even. Just delicious and felt like home. Can't wait for my next visit home and an early morning stop here!"}
{"text":"I am a very anti-chain person. I even have an \"eat local\" bumper sticker. HOWEVER, Original Pancake House is so amazing I just pretend it's independently owned so that I can permit myself to eat there. So good, great service, big open pretty and well-lit room without the cold sterile feeling of a chain. Affordable, great go-to, but there's often a line.  The bacon, you guys. The bacon."}
{"text":"Great service and excellent food, what else could you ask for?  Got here with my family in the midst of the lunch rush.  We were in a bit of a hurry, but even with a line they had us at a table in less than 5 minutes.  The menu is extensive, sandwiches, crepes (sweet and savory), pancakes of course, and so much more  It was really hard for me to choose just one item because everything sounded so delicious.  I finally decided on the cherry crepes, which were superb. The crepes were tender and delicate, the cherry sauce was wonderful and not cloying sweet.  I would definitely eat here again."}
{"text":"Seafood Omelet was succulent yet savory and paired with the pancakes. Two Words I gotta say to all who come here. Absolutely amazing"}
{"text":"When: Saturday March 24, 2012 11:30am  Atmosphere: When I arrived there were people standing outside waiting for tables, this might fool you into thinking these people were actually waiting for a phenomenal breakfast. Instead I was met by a waiting area that was humid and hot and over crowded. It was also very loud and there was little seating, basically a hallway with a few benches.  The wait was around 30 minutes and we were greeted by a server and led to a table that had been \"cleaned\" and I use cleaned lightly. The table was covered in crumbs and debris from the previous guests. To the point someone had to wipe the bench of the booth off before we could sit down.  Experience: Once we were sat an impatient waiter took our drink order and returned quickly. A tip to anyone who may order water at this place, ask for a grown-up glass so you are not given a glass the size of a tomato paste can.  The menu was varied and had a lot of things to offer. I ordered the scrambled eggs and diced ham, a stack of pancakes and an order of turkey sausage.   First, the turkey sausage was the blandest, greasiest turkey sausage I've ever had the displeasure of eating. They appeared to have been fried in bacon grease. Also, for $3.99 you receive three sausage patties hardly larger than a half dollar. Very disappointing.  Second, the scrambled eggs and ham. It is so simple of a meal, but it was done so terribly. The eggs were under cooked, and clearly four eggs, meant two eggs extended with some kind of filler, like egg beaters, cream or milk. They were more a sludge than a light airy scrambled egg. The ham was also very poor quality, chipped ham from the deli would have been more satisfying.  Lastly, the pancakes...for being The Original Pancake House, I was underwhelmed with their basic pancakes. On the plus side, these were at least cooked well. However they had very little flavor, it pained me to have to pour syrup all over them to make them somewhat enjoyable.  Overall: The place was packed, hot and the wait staff was impatient, not rude, but very pushy. The food was borderline terrible, but if you like bland and kind of edible this is a place you should check out. Hopefully my experience was an anomaly but, it will take some real convincing to get me to go back to this place."}
{"text":"The food here is okay. The menu is overwhelmingly large. I went in on a Saturday morning & service was surprisingly quick. It definitely wasn't as packed as most places are for weekend breakfast. I ordered crepes that were stuffed with eggs, cheese, and veggies and all of my food seemed pretty fresh. I was not impressed with their home fries. They were cut into very large pieces, some were over cooked, some where undercooked & they weren't seasoned very well. I think the food could have more flavor to it, but overall, my experience was okay & I would come back if I wanted a quick bite on a weekend."}
{"text":"Not only are the breakfast dishes the best and the restaurant the most attractive, comfortable, and spacious of its kind, but this is the place for the perfect Jewish-style reuben sandwich, as good as any delicatessen I have visited throughout the United States!  The seeded rye bread, kosher corned beef, cheese, and dressing made the dish delectable and the home fries, included for the reasonable price of $9.99, made for a perfect early lunch. Service from Corinne was cheerful, friendly, and quick.  Our three dishes were out in less than ten minutes. Bravo, Mr. Schweinsberg and staff!  You are the best!"}
{"text":"My favorite here is not the pancakes (which are good), but rather the ham and egg scramble.  Always a good stop when in town!"}
{"text":"I met a friend here today at 9am...the place was busy, but not crowded.   When I parked, as soon as I got out of the car I could smell waffles and pancakes....the whole parking lot smelled like a syrup-soaked paradise.   I had coffee and eggs Benedict (which was served with three piping hot pancakes, to my surprise) and my friend had hot orange tea and a bacon waffle. The eggs Benedict was made as it usually is, but with very, very thick slices of grilled ham, poached eggs and hollandaise sauce.  It was wonderful and pleasantly not greasy or super heavy.  The ham was not super salty, the eggs were perfect and the sauce was not oily/greasy.  I gave half of the order, which was served with home-fries and pancakes, to my friend, who was eyeing it!   Since I didn't want to eat all of it myself, I shared.  Her waffle was crisp on the outside, evenly cooked, and fluffy on the inside with crisp bacon throughout. The bacon waffle was served with syrup and butter.  The three pancakes that accompanied my dish were hot (nothing sits under a heat lamp, here) and didn't need any toppings...they were good.  Flavorful, not sweet, not dry, not bland.  They were a very happy medium.  I topped them with a bit of syrup, and as good as they were, I could only eat a couple of bites as I simply had too much food, even after sharing.  The syrup is either 100% real or a very, very close formulation.  I can't eat much of anything as sweet as syrup. Everything was great.  Everything a greasy spoon place should be, but less grease!  Anyway, the server was very courteous and speedy and the cashier was also very cordial.  The restaurant was also well-lit, spacious, and clean.  I think I've found my new favorite east side breakfast spot!"}
{"text":"Yummy yummy yummy yummy. The pancakes here are always on point they never disappoint!! Service here is mediocre but I don't come here for the service I come for the pancakes. Yummy yummy yummy yummy. Definitely a must if you love eating breakfast."}
{"text":"I love gravy and that's the one thing this place is missing.  Missing big time because gravy is one of the most delicious things ever!  Besides not having gravy this place is great.  The pancakes are delicious and being named 'The Pancake House' they have many different kinds.  The Pecan and Bacon are my favorite.  I think bacon pancakes are second only to gravy in deliciousness.  Whenever I go I get one of their omelets.  I try to eat right and I trick myself into thinking that a bacon and gouda omelet is just full of protein and dairy. My scale tells me differently but it's always worth it. The omelets are huge and extremely tasty.  My family likes appetizers, even at breakfast.  The chocolate crepes are usually passed around the table for everyone to try.  While I couldn't down the whole dish by myself, the crepes are amazing! Since they've moved into the old cafe the wait time seems to be much shorter. Service has been par everytime I have gone.  My one complaint rhymes with Davy."}
{"text":"Sunday morning breakfast.  A cherry blintz and cup of fresh fruit.  YUM.    Friend had strawberry blintz and was also quite pleased.  Menu:  HUGE Service:  Efficient Prices:  Just right Portions:  Big"}
{"text":"This place has decent-enough food, but with the terrible service the place has you might as well go to Denny's or IHOP instead.   I went to this restaurant for a reunion with one of my old work mates from the now-defunct Tower Records. I decided to go along, feeling I needed to see these people I hadn't seen in years and try a new restaurant.  Let me start the review by saying I had absolutely no problem with the food here. Our party ordered a plethora of diverse item, and what I tried and saw was very good. The Belgian waffle that I ordered was superb.  But that's where the good stuff ends. Our food took an eternity to come out. I don't think I have ever waited this long to get my food, at ANY restaurant. For this alone, the staff should have discounted our meal, but no one stepped forward to do so.  And it only gets worse! The 6 of us all had different ways of paying (some credit/debit cards, some cash, etc.), and the staff REFUSED TO SPLIT THE BILL. I admit, we probably should have asked them to split the check earlier on, but when you're running a restaurant, you work with your customers and do what is right for them. This meant tons of money borrowing/lending/ATM trips just to pay it. Paying for our food should NEVER be a hassle like this. These jackasses are getting the SAME AMOUNT OF MONEY either way, so how hard would it have been to split the damn check?  My last complaint is that the restaurant has been moved from its original position. Originally it was right inside Green Valley Ranch, just inside of the north doors atop the parking garage. it has now been moved much deeper into the facility, meaning you're going to have a long smoke-filled trek to the restaurant through the casino just to get there.  Seriously, why eat at this place when you can avoid the annoying trek through the parking garage and casino, and just go eat at Denny's or IHOP? The food is about the same quality either way, and I have never had these issues at either of the other chains. So go elsewhere to have your pancake needs filled.  Food: B- Service: F Atmosphere: C"}
{"text":"The Original Pancake House in Green valley Ranch casino has changed. Originally it was located near the parking garage entrance and was AWESOME!!!!! The food, service, and decor were perfect. The only problem was that they never had enough space for all the people. On the weekend the lines were so long it was like waiting for a concert.  Then they moved to the old cafe space in the back of the casino. Much more space. And it started tanking. They brought in a lot of new faces. The food went down almost immediately, the serving sizes shrank, the flavors changed,  the staff were clueless, and worst of all the open area had smoke drifting in from the casino.  Service is now routinely slow and the nice cozy feel is gone. I dont go there anymore. Maybe I should have given it 2 stars..........barely average and if you arent staying in the casino not worth the trip anymore. I used to drive from Summerlin to go there."}
{"text":"A perfect place for good, clean, hangover curing, hearty breakfast.  I love the cherry crepes, chocolate chip pancakes and ham & cheese omelets. They go crazy with the cheese it's just oozing out of your omelet as soon as you cut into it.  I can never finish my food; it's just too big here.  Minus one star for service that isn't up to par.  I wish they have more fresh juices like apple.  Overall one of my favorite breakfast spots to hit when there isn't a line going all the way around the restaurant."}
{"text":"Let's start with server, Sara. (Longer brown hair), said she was a server at another restaurant locally!  She is not only sweet, friendly, on top of her game, but spot on with everything! If someone in management does not see this or have been told before, please do! We will ask for her and wait to have her again! You have a hard worker in her!"}
{"text":"Never disappointed with service, food or variety.  This is the current go-to place for breakfast!"}
{"text":"The BF has been on a bit of a breakfast kick lately so we came to Aliante to check out the casino, the poker room and get some pancakes.  We settled on some Corned Beef Hash which comes with 4 thin potato pancakes and 2 eggs which we ordered \"basted\" (it's basically over easy but they just don't flip it over they pour hot oil on it to cook the top) and some Hawaiian pancakes which has pineapple cooked into the pancakes with tropical syrup. Pancakes are made small and come with 6 in an order and most items can be ordered as a half an order as well.   I like that the hash wasn't the finely minced corned beef but chunky pieces. The potato pancakes are good, goes well with the apple sauce they give you which I originally was apprehensive about.   The surprise for me is the pancakes. I am not a pancake person, but the BF was feeling it so I told him to order it. It was light and fluffy and had good flavor...I pleasantly was surprised that I was reaching for a 2nd pancake when normally a handful of bites is my usual. I know pancake is in their name, but I didn't think I was going to like them this much. Going to come back for pancakes- from me this is saying A LOT.   Service was attentive, my glass was filled twice when it was barely reaching to 1/3 of it left. She checked on us often to make sure we were doing okay and looked that we were done and came straight away to see if we wanted our check. Aahh, it's nice not to be held \"hostage\" for a check.   I normally like the OG spots of chains since they have character, but last time I went to the Charleston, my booth was broken and not comfy at all. I rather come here where it's clean, attentive and it's closer to home."}
{"text":"Not to die for, but definitely good stuff."}
{"text":"The food is mediocre. Pancakes tasted like it was microwaved. Eggs came out partially cold, warm on outside, cold in side. Service was sad. Would not recommend. Double charged."}
{"text":"Not very often that I find myself impressed with a pancake; or an omelet. This place delivered on every aspect of breakfast that I care about. Coffee was brought to me within seconds of seating, the server was nice and very knowledgable of the menu, and the food was excellent. The omelettes use 6 eggs and come with 3 pancakes, what a deal, could probably cover you for both breakfast and lunch. Not sure how busy they get seeing as I walked in 3 minutes after they opened, but the staff didn't seem sluggish and the place is very clean. Will definitely go again!"}
{"text":"I love pancakes!   Now that we got that out of the way...let's move on to the review.   When I got there, there was a line. But it was moving quickly. 5-10 min wait. Fanfreakintastic.   We had a sweet older lady as our waitress. She was amazing! She has a favorite-grandma essence to her.   I couldn't decide between the chocolate chip pancakes and another dish and i really really wanted some bacon that morning! so she suggested getting the senior special (cheaper price! Score! Btw I am not a senior citizen) and a side of the chocolate chip pancakes.   Our food came out great, nothing to complain about. My bacon came out extra crispy not burnt just the way I like it!!!  I really loved their chocolate chip pancakes!!! The chips are slightly warm and oh so smearable on your pancakes. scooped some of the side whip cream and  tossed it on my pancake, took the first bite and I was in pancake heaven. no need for syrup... it was delicious just with the  melted chocolate chips n whip cream.  she checked up on us a couple of times...I always appreciate that and not afraid to give a larger tip when that happens. I have got to say she was one of the best servers I've had any where. That's a lot coming from me, I take that sh*t seriously when it comes to any customer service. :)   Can't wait to go again!"}
{"text":"Eating here was a disappointment compared to the other OPH locations I've eaten at, as well as my past experiences eating at Green Valley Ranch.   The restaurant feels cramped, with too many small tables in the open center of the room. A woman seated at the table behind mine banged her chair into mine by simply pulling it out to sit down. They seem to serve many families; the close seating must cause problems when kids get restless or fussy.  The food my party ordered was slow to arrive and no longer hot when it was brought to us. Other diners seemed to have the same 20-minute wait for their dishes, so we couldn't write this off as just a fault of our server. I ordered the Challah French Toast and found it to be a little dry in the center. If I had to eat here again I would choose something else.  Two stars for the large portions, the many choices on the all-breakfast menu, and the not quite standard 80s hits piped in. (Anyone playing \"Video Killed The Radio Star\" is on my good side.) But if I'm ever at GVR and in the mood for breakfast again I'll try their coffee shop instead."}
{"text":"Saw this place on yelp and decided to try it. 20 minute wait wasn't bad. Totally worth it for the bacon. Service was friendly and place was adorable. Definitely satisfied."}
{"text":"Note: OPH's parking lot is perilously hard to get into, particularly on weekends. I advise you to go there late in the morning or early in the afternoon during the week. We tried to visit at least twice before only to leave in frustration because we could not find a parking spot.  With that word of guidance, I can candidly say that The Original Pancake House was worth the effort. Kay and I each had an unplanned day off last week, and we knew this would likely be our best chance to go. Arriving at around 11AM, we were at first dismayed to find the lot full yet again after traveling that winding, mountainous, nearly endless road to what comes off as a shining castle in the sky, but before we could even think of turning back, a silver-haired gent in an equally cinereal luxury car began to pull out. With glee, we took that vacated space, entered the restaurant, and were seated with no wait whatsoever.    Kay and I were welcomed by a greying, urbane, sociable, modish, and towering fellow I'll refer to as The Brunchman. He was elated that we finally made it and seemed to be precognitive; we felt he knew us despite never having met him.   \"You've come to us at last,\" he declared as he gracefully skirred towards an empty and clean table with Kay and I in pursuit.  Just as we sat down, our young, lanky, bespectacled server appeared before us seemingly instantaneously. Her name was (I think?) Nicole, and she is not only an aspiring model but also previously hailed from Kay's general area. In Nicole, we both made a new friend, discussing concerts, food, and life with her as we indulged on delecacies from OPH's expansive bill of fare.  When I saw that the strawberries came with fresh whipped cream, I knew what my first course would be considering my obsession with said dairy product. The strawberries themselves were ripe and pure. In a separate bowl came an alabaster cloud of felicity, and through the cloud were the strawberries dredged, making for simple, natural pleasures of the palate.  A Crabcake Eggs Benedict came next, and with that, my lone complaint. Hollandaise Sauce is a tricky thing to master. I've tried to make it myself with somewhat mixed results. In this case, it simply tasted like warmed over, unseasoned egg yolks. However, the eggs were poached expertly, the duo of crabcakes were crammed with genuine crustacean meat, the buttery English muffins were plush, and the pink remoulade, the dish's saving grace, was such a wedding of tangy and creamy that the bland Hollandaise sauce was easily overpowered and forgotten.  Psst. Brunchman. My mom will sell you her Hollandaise recipe.   Kay had the Coconut Pancakes, which were as crispy as they were fluffy and came with exquisitely airy whipped butter as well as an edibly esoteric \"hot tropical syrup\" that evoked sheer Paradise with its fruity sugariness. Also eaten by Kay was an order of Corned Beef Hash. I found the large, chunky, auroral potatoes to be flawless and the plentiful corned beef to be as keenly kosher and arcanely flavorful as any I've ever had, but Kay didn't like it as much as I did, sadly enough. Thankfully, her pancakes made her happy.  Enter: The Dutch Baby. My mother had spoken of it in whispers when telling me of her experience with the North Hills OPH. Since it takes 20 minutes to prepare, it is recommended that one order it with the rest of brunch.   Minutes before it was placed in front of me, The Brunchman dramatically gave me a consultation.   With his eyes ablaze and his long arms oscillating as if he was about to cast a spell, he said \"Take the butter, spread it...AROUND the interior of the...errr...baby. Then squeeze some lemon onto it and dust it with the powdered sugar.\" After his lecture, he kissed his fingers and floated away, asking rhetorically with a beam across his lips, \"You'll be back tomorrow morning, no?\"   When it was ready for service, I followed The Brunchman's instructions closely. The Dutch Baby is not a pancake; it is a bowl of doughy love, made lardy by the butter, lightly sweet by the powdered sugar, and acidic by the lemon. However, something was amiss. Syrup! I drizzled some onto the puff, and Nicole leaped forward to stop me only to be held back gently by the grinning Brunchman. He pressed a finger to her lips, shook his head, and looked my way only to nod in approval.   \"I was hoping you'd do that,\" The Brunchman said. \"I forgot to mention the syrup. You did well, young man.\"   The syrup would be what took this pudding-like dish, also known as a Bismarck, into Shangri-la.   As I finished, The Brunchman provided a history lesson, and Nicole spoke with us some more, this time about her cosmetology goals and former places of employment. Kay and I were so taken by the OPH's hospitality, we almost forgot that we weren't at someone's home and had other plans for the day. Although our hunger had been abated, we felt compelled to stay...and return..."}

{"text":"Located in the Green Valley Resort & Spa!  I saw that there was a pancake house in the hotel and knew that is where I wanted to have breakfast. We waited about 5 min for a table. (place was packed).   Our server was sooo nice and attentive.  Our food arrived at our table only 10 minutes after ordering.  Talk about quick service. I had their French Toast which was good.  It hit the spot ! (I can't kick this french toast habit!). I also got a side of over easy eggs and and english muffin.  That completed my perfect breakfast meal.  Everything was good and tasty!"}
{"text":"Solid breakfast.  Great service.  Our waitress was a little older and so good.  Bought the food out fast, due to only two arms she would serve a couple of plates and then acknowledge what would be out next. Know when to refill our cups and glasses.  The Blueberry Pancakes were good with plump fresh blueberries, and came with a small pitcher of fresh blueberries with some blueberry sauce.   From experience know to order the short stack and our waitress also advised that it was 3 pancakes.  Plenty to eat.  The bacon was crisp and is very thick.    We always seem to get the front room which is quite noisy, all hard surfaces.  The back room does have carpet, wonder if it is quieter?  Our waitress shifted sides of the table to take orders because she could not here people those at the other end of the table when ordering or their questions.  My glass and others were plastic with cracks in them.  I mentioned it to our waitress and she said she would look for some without the cracks but most were cracked but did not leak and she would do her best.  Maybe IHOP should try a different glass?"}
{"text":"This has been my weekly go-to sunday breakfast spot since I moved here last summer. It's very reliable! Reasons I love it:  *The line you wait in moves very quickly.. I've never had to wait more than 15-20 minutes.  *Service is fast and friendly. *Food is awesome! I love the pancakes and the baked omelettes. Also love that they have gouda cheese! The pumpkin pancakes they serve during the winter months are my favorite.. they even come topped with fresh whipped cream."}
{"text":"Came here for Sunday morning breakfast.  No wait, seated promptly. I ordered bacon and eggs. Eggs were fine, bacon was dark and chewy. Not the best. My friend had shells w powdered sugar and lemon. They were basically crepes. The lemon pieces were too tiny to be useful. Coffee only ok. Service, excellent. There are too many really good breakfast places in the pittsburgh area to plan on coming again."}
{"text":"I made an account on Yelp just to talk about my horrible experience at this restaurant. To begin, I ordered a banana chocolate chip crepe. When I received it, I was in awe of the small size. Probably the size of a mere dollar bill. As soon as I took a bit, I was disgusted. It tasted like a sock soaked in milk. After the 3rd bite, I found a hair and I knew I couldn't choke down the poor excuse of a crepe. When I called the waiter over to complain, he said \"well, to late now!\". When I finally got to the manger he took it away and that was it. I did not get my money back nor a replacement. What ever happened to the customer is always right? 100% would not recommend this restaurant."}
{"text":"Pretty decent place.  Really nice food (though a bit more expensive than a lot of comparable places).  Only real gripe is if I recall correctly everything is ala carte (pancakes were by themselves, meat was a separate side) which while opening up the number of potential combinations, it hikes the price a bit.  I have seen a few reviews that dinged the service, however we went to a later breakfast (about 10AM) on a weekday and had no issues at all."}
{"text":"I had breakfast there 6/18 /14.  I had a omelet which was very dry and undercooked. The service was poor. My waitress was giving me my check before my food ever came. I asked for extra butter when i did get my meal and waitress never brought it. The environment  Is nice but food and service was below par. Very overrated."}
{"text":"I love this spot as a go-to breakfast spot. The Original Pancake house has a great menu for a price that is comparable to what I consider to be lower quality diners (Denny's and Eat n' Park). Why not go to the Original Pancake house if you have a choice between the two?  There's plenty of setting in gigantic booths. I think the interior is furnished with Amish made fixtures. If they're not Amish, they still give you a quality feel. The booths are huge and eating in this place definitively won't leave you feeling desperate for your space to enjoy the time and meal there. I've eaten there many times. I'm a huge fan of the weekday specials which are dirt cheap for such great combos! Most of the time I find myself there on a weekend though when the specials are not offered. It's then I really have to start choosing what I'm gonna satisfy myself with that morning. Pancakes are a no brainer, but all you get is pancakes unless you pay for a side of something else. That's the advantage of the weekday specials; your choice of eggs, meat, and pancakes (regular or special) for a low price. I've had so many of the special pancakes I can't decide which is my favorite. I can't say I've ever been disappointed though. I did get a crazy stomach ache one day trying to finish a full stack. Beware! It's a lot of pancakes! The omelets are also great. Again, on the weekends you're limited to a 6 eggs omelet VS. the weekday when you can get a smaller size. 6 eggs is a huge omelet! My favorite here is clear though...the Greek omelet is amazing! Stuffed with lamb, spinach, and that delicious cucumber sauce. Wow, what a great meal! One of my only complaints is about the orange juice. They only offer one kind. I think it's fresh squeezed on site. I'm all about fresh squeezed, but there must be something about the oranges they use or maybe I just don't like pulp, but it's never what I'm looking for. The coffee, however, is great and you won't have any trouble taking down several cups of that. When you're ready to go remember you have to pay up front near the exit. Don't sit at the table with your card out waiting for the waitress to take it for you. She probably will say something (because all the staff has been friendly and accommodating in my experience), but you can save yourself some minutes just knowing ahead of time! We you do leave, you can look over the hill to the Denny's below and feel good about yourself that you made the better choice :-)."}
{"text":"Food is okay, coffee is good. The omelets are enormous, so check those out. The pcancakes seemed to have a weird taste to me. It wasn't anything particularly special to me, but I will probably be checking it out again to try out a wider variety of food."}
{"text":"Great breakfast foods.  Tastiest pancakes I ever head.  Everything the family had was delicious.  Coffee, good for a restaurant.  Our server was not as friendly as you would hope, especially having kids present."}
{"text":"I stopped in to the Pancake House for breakfast yesterday.  I've driven by it many times and noticed that it's always full.  Upon arrival, I was promptly seated and I ordered orange juice and a veggie omelet.  The waitress asked me if syrup was okay for my pancakes.  I looked at her funny and she said, 'Pancakes come with your omelet.'  I was a little surprised by that.  A minute later, she delivered the orange juice, which I tasted.  It had a lot of pulp in it and I actually don't like that.  It was almost too thick to drink with a straw.  A few minutes later, my veggie omelet arrived.  It was huge!  It was very tasty, loaded with veggies, and was very satisfying.  I actually didn't finish it all.    The pancakes that were served on the side came in a trio, were small, light, and fluffy.  They tasted perfect!  I loved the cakes.  The only downside to the breakfast was the price.  For my veggie omelet and orange juice, I paid over $14.  I believe this was the most expensive breakfast I've ever eaten."}
{"text":"I've been to several of these franchises, and frankly this is the worst location. Sadly it is my nearest one. Don't get me wrong, the food is still good, better than many or most breakfast spots in the area. Service is good too. On par with all other local restaurants, and the manager (owner?) Seems like a friendly guy. I wanna like it, I do!  Other locations (Oregon and Utah) are nearly life-changing breakfast experiences. The Woodmere location is not... Pricing is a little higher than it should be, but remember this place is across the street from a Tiffanys jewelers. Bacon is thick awesome, but it's a buck a piece. Omelettes start at $10. The average Midwesterner will have two meals from that omelette, and it comes with three pancakes.  The portions are in line (which is to say ridiculous) with the other locations, but the food is just...not as good. Foodservice issue? Recipe design? I dunno. I just know that I pay a lot for breakfast when I go here, and I always feel bad because it's not like the other ones I've been to. Today I had the requisite biscuits and gravy ($6...for B &G? It's $3 at Bob Evans), and it was sour. Not sour like something was bad, just like too much lemon juice or vinegar was splashed into the gravy. It's always a little more sour there, but today it was like too sour.  A little off every time I visit. Every time. Every. Single. Time. Last time I went, the B & G was some of the best I've ever eaten it was clearly another cook or recipe. Every other OPH I've been to is solid, consistent, and a pure delight. This one is ok."}
{"text":"A friend of mine introduced me to the Original Pancake House a year or so ago and it has become a favorite of ours.  We like to grab brunch there every few weeks or so.  I like to try something different each time I go and have to say I haven't been disappointed yet.  Omelets are always delicious with nice, fresh ingredients.  The side of pancakes is fantastic.  I recently tried the huevos rancheros - delicious, and on my last visit, I tried the almond and cinnamon French toast.  Oh my.  (Don't forget to ask for real maple syrup!)"}
{"text":"The pancakes were good. When I went to this one, the meal had some issues but the second time I went to a different location and the service was exemplary as well as the food. This is a nice establishment, I wish that there were more in the city."}
{"text":"My favorite gluten-free brunch place? Original Pancake House!  Tired of being relegated to eggs and meat while your fellow brunchers enjoy delicious baked goodies? Well head over to OPH! They've got MULTIPLE options of delicious gluten-free pancakes including buttermilk, bacon, pecan, chocolate chip, cinnamon apple, and blueberry! My pecan pancakes were loaded and top with delicious toasted pecans. Gluten eaters have even more choices! The \"specials\" included pumpkin, of course, and gingerbread, which were so aromatic I could smell their spicy deliciousness from across the table.  We also enjoyed the home fries. Their interpretation of home fries are scrumptious giant chunks of seasoned potatoes cooked to crispy goodness. My husband and daughter dug the kielbasa.   Don't forget the fresh squeezed OJ thick with luscious pulp."}
{"text":"My friend and I decided to try a breakfast place while she was in town and I'm so glad we found this! It was our first time and I can say for certain we'll be back. The prices were EXTREMELY reasonable for the amount of food u get and the food is absolutely delicious- best I've had in breakfast. The omelettes are baked and come out so fluffy and amazing. The bacon alone rocks the house and is the best I've ever tasted. Real maple syrup kicked off their mouth watering pancakes so we'll def be back! Polite server and quick service-"}
{"text":"Yes, it's a chain!  I was surprised when I heard about this place. People were raving to me- original pancake house is awesome! So off I went on my birthday with my parents....the moment I woke up.  It looked so unfamiliar to me...until I walked in and looked at the menu. Wait a second, I told my parents, I've had that dutch apple baby before!!! They just looked at me with a look that said- yes, Rachael, you probably have.  A few years ago, a few friends and I made a road trip to Chicago...and happened to stop by this amazing breakfast place in the Chicago suburbs. I asked- and yep, this place is indeed a chain! I ordered my long lost missed dutch apple pancake right away. My parents got something else. I don't remember- I was too overly happy that I got to eat that big bad pancake.  Imagine an egg tart.... in gigantic form with apples. That's pretty much it. I messed up ordering, (I think I said dutch and not dutch apple?) so it came out wrong..and the waitress wasn't too happy with me wanting my dutch apple. She was actually pretty rude about it....but whatevers... I really wanted it. It wasn't the same as I remember tho- when I had it before, it was crunchy on top...this was more of a soggy apple mess..but still, it was GOOD.  I thought the coffee was different.... definitely wasn't your diner type of coffee- a better blend. Overall, this is a solid chain to go to- when you want your pancakes."}
{"text":"I can throw back a stack of flap jacks with the best of em', and when it comes to an omelette, my belly means business, so naturally this place is on my list of must-hits  Up to date I have always excepted that the delicious offerings here seem to come with a side of sub-par service. Today was truly rough though, and for that a less-than-stellar review shall finally be written.    Our waitress, although nice and knowledgeable really struggled with getting our table of four''s needs met... and we were not asking for a ton!  We all went without refills several times, the food came out in the most random sequence imaginable, and most of the items were in some way or another jacked-up versions of what we had actually ordered.  Don't get me wrong, I still ate the accouterments that were delivered after my entree had been finished, but with every bite I choked back a hint of dismay.   In the waitress' defense, she did drop a small discount on to our bill without us verbally saying a word, but still the service challenges outweighed the gesture. However, I would much rather pay full price and write a glowing five-star review after a well executed dining experience, but the truths need to be told, and I have the free time to write them.  On the plus side, the food, although not really what we had ordered was edible and in a few cases, pretty good. Check the place out for yourself, but perhaps order off the menu WITHOUT ANY substitutes and try to keep your group down to a casual two.   P.S. The Bacon is fierce... Order a side of it no matter what... Unless you are vegan..."}
{"text":"I stood in the entrance way for six minutes and not one employee came over.  Finally someone came over and asked if I wanted to be seated I said yes and was promptly seated at smallest table next to kitchen entrance.   I pointed to a different table and the man hrumphed as he walked me over.  I turned around and stated sorry I bothered you, I'm going to Denny's and I left."}
{"text":"To the Polly d look alike fuck you the best way to not get a tip is to make sure to make your customer wait for 30 min for drinks."}
{"text":"Keep it simple here.  I know there's about 20 varieties of pancakes and omelets but, in my experience, your typical pancakes, bacon and eggs is the way to go.    The pancakes are hot, fluffy, and have a certain sweetness to them that almost renders syrup unnecessary...almost.  The bacon is thick cut and served up crispy, just how I like 'em.  The eggs are, well, eggs and there's really not much to say about that.    My only complaint is that the service here is iffy at times, and it often takes a while to get seated despite numerous empty tables.  If they could fix that aspect, I'd be giving out 5 stars without a doubt."}
{"text":"Consistently great food.  Too bad half the servers...who have been here forever...are so inattentive.   I have been trying to ask our server for water for the past 10 minutes, but he keeps walking past us with his back toward us.  I guess I have offended him! Haha."}
{"text":"Even though the posted hours say they are open until 3 p.m., they turned us away at 2 p.m. because they were closing early. I think the food here is good, but this is very poor customer relations.  We intentionally come late so it's less crowded and there isn't a wait.  This is just very annoying."}
{"text":"Original pancake house is so delicious the food is always fresh and the quality is impeccable! On the weekdays they have specials which is really nice considering how expensive it is. Come here all the time with my family and never have any complaints, the staff are really friendly and nice. Except the last time I was the waitress brought out the wrong order and then gave me attitude about how it was my fault then rudely grabbed my plate and said \"fine ill just take it back\" and at that time I was so shocked (and afraid she was going to spit in my food to be honest) so I just ate what I DID NOT order. Definitely needs to adjust some of the employees rudeness but the food is delicious!!"}
{"text":"Potato pancakes are delightful! I am only deducting stars because of the service, or lack therein. Our waitress was very busy as there was a line of people waiting in the casino to eat here. I can understand busy times, but I cannot accept having to wait 15 minutes once seated for my order to be taken. I would have flagged her down, but she was nowhere to be found. Once we put in our order, it didn't take long to get our food, but then started the long wait for our check. So annoying!!!   I ordered the eggs Benedict which came with 4 potato pancakes which were out of this world. The eggs Benedict was eh okay, the hollandaise sauce was very thick and heavy which I'm not a fan of. I might just order the potato pancakes next time."}
{"text":"They're not open on Mondays despite what every website said.   I don't go there often but they always had good food.  Disappointing to be lied to due to someone's laziness.  Waffles INCaffinated up 19 was very good anyways, will probably make that my new off day breakfast joint."}
{"text":"One of our favorite places for breakfast, it's our go to place on the weekend!  As much as I'd love to try their pancakes, well due to blood sugar issues, sadly I can't.  We love their seafood crepes, Jose scramble, Joe's scramble and many other dishes - not to mention their great coffee.  Love their staff, always so friendly and welcoming!  Just a great place to go for consistently good food and service.  There is sometimes a wait for a table (it moves pretty fast), but that speaks for the food and service - people will return if it's a good experience!"}
{"text":"Me and the hubby haven't been here in forever. We decided to stop today. It was delightful. Service was fantastic and the pancakes are big and not too dry. I got the blueberry stack and they were chalked full of blueberries. I got a side of Turkey sausage which was great too although a little on the spicy side. The hubby got the buttermilk pancakes and noted they weren't dry and they were light. He got eggs and sausage as well. The only thing I have to say bad is I wish they would done a quick floor sweep under our table because there were crayons and smashed pancakes...the latter of which I stepped on:("}
{"text":"The food here is absolutely delicious. My favorite breakfast place and I refuse to get pancakes from anywhere else. The servers are not the best. Coming from someone who has worked in the service industry, I understand how stressful things can get during busy hours, but I was not impressed and some what disappointed at how the staff treats their customers."}
{"text":"I really am very surprised at how much I enjoy this place.  I think it is really as simple as (well prepared food)+(attentive service)+(reasonable prices)=Breakfasty Goodness.  I avoided going here for a very long time because I didn't expect much of it, but after getting over that hump, I have been back several times, always leaving happy.    The pancakes are great, the omelets are huge and stuffed chock full of your desired filling, and the crepes aren't bad either.  I have decided that the pumpkin pancakes are not to be missed.  The meat lovers omelet is great too.  Live a little and order some bacon on the side too."}
{"text":"Such a popular place! The service is excellent and make me feel home. So does the food. Delicious and plenty . I ordered a meat lover omelette and it gaves me a good mixed flavor of meat and egg. The cheese is the bonus !In a word, a good place to have our brunch"}
{"text":"Friends have raved about this place, so when I was up this way for an appointment, I had to stop in. The buckwheat pancakes (which I had with lingonberries on the side) were terrific, and Ron was a great server - everyone was efficient and accommodating."}
{"text":"I always get the strawberry pancakes because they are excellent. I love their food and it's one of the only places i actually enjoy their eggs. I will continue to come back. Customer service is good too."}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite places to grab breakfast or brunch with a certain Westside friend of mine. I found out on our last visit that the omelets (this is the correct spelling, by the way) each have 6 eggs in them.   It sounds weird, but I never knew that I liked pancakes until I had them here a couple years ago. I grew up with the kind of pancakes that you make by adding water to a little tub o' powder and shaking it vigorously.   I'm not crazy about the crowded waiting area, especially if I get there right after people are leaving church... People are hungry and angry at noon on Sundays!"}
{"text":"I do enjoy breakfast out with my hubby once in awhile and I enjoy coming here.  The service is quite friendly... never had a nasty server.  Coffee is served quickly and is oh so good!  I can't seem to get past the blueberry pancakes with the blueberry (hot) compote.  Yum!  I never (and I mean NEVER) order without that awesome bacon.  It's my fav, without a doubt.  Always keep in mind that many of the pancake choices can be ordered as a half-order (which is a great idea when you're ordering bacon).  Time it before Church or early in the day and you won't have to wait in line long at all.  Much better than an IHOP.  Enjoy!"}
{"text":"The restaurant was filthy the orange juice had seeds when i said this to the waitress she acted as if it was normal. Then they brought my gf a half rotten warm bowl of fruit. Just unacceptable we left without even getting our meal it was a sad day for me.  Dont go here unless you are trying to contract botulism"}
{"text":"This is the regular breakfast spot for my husband and I, as they take the $10 restaurant.com certificates.  However, they will only take them Monday through Friday, which makes me a sad panda.  My husband always orders the chocolate chip pancakes, and goes into a chocolate coma the rest of the day.  He loves them though, as much as I wish he would not order them.  I usually order an omelet, as they are baked and light and fluffy.  However, someone needs to tell the cooks to stop putting so much cheese on them, as it overwhelms the flavor of the omelet.  The first time I ate here I ordered the spinach omelet with cheddar, and there was so much cheese that the grease was dripping all over the plate.  The second time, I ordered the veggie omelet and got the gouda cheese, thinking it wouldn't be as greasy.  It wasn't greasy but there was so much cheese I couldn't taste the egg at all in the dish. I'd still order it again, just with no cheese.  A good place (but crowded on the weekends), and will be going regularly but will be yelling them about trying to kill me from serving a block of cheese in my eggs."}
{"text":"Lots of food.  Good quality.  Much better than the other chain options for breakfast.  Could use some sound dampening."}
{"text":"Simply elegant for a pancake house. The place sits atop a hill and is decorated and maintained beautifully. We love the original pancake house and it is unfortunate there isn't one closer than 2 hours from our home. While we were in Pittsburgh we were lucky enough to find this place close to where we stayed. The food, coffee and decor are great!  The freshly squeezed OJ is fantastic, from what I was able to enjoy.  My one year old Isabella decided she liked it too and frank most of it. :-) This place will not disappoint. This gem in Pittsburgh is simply great! It's a must!  Enjoy!!"}
{"text":"I thought this place was pretty good. The interior is on the generic side. I guess that could be expected based on the location in a new strip mall. I had a bacon, cheddar and tomato omelete and it was huge! Definitely enough for lunch the next day. The sides of bacon are excellent. They are very thick cuts. The blueberry pancakes were also very good. I would rather eat at a local and independently owned place though."}
{"text":"Great breakfast place. It's been voted the best breakfast place for the past 4 years by the Best of Las Vegas. Pancakes are excellent, as well as the omelettes. I like how the omelettes come with 3 of their signature buttermilk pancakes too! I've had their specialty: Apple Pancake. A little sweet and huge, but still tasted great."}
{"text":"This is beyond the best pancake place in America. Seriously, I have been living in California for almost 2 years now and nothing compares to this place. They have the same place here but it is not classy or yummy at all. This location and the one on the east side make all others look like a joke. My husband and I cannot wait to come home in June and eat here. : )"}
{"text":"Good food for the price.  The servers are always good. Big place standing room only.  Fast service.  Sometimes I feel like I have to hurry and eat and go. Not a leisurely atmosphere but kid friendly."}
{"text":"The four stars are for the food...NOT the service. The servers are fine. The management is ridiculous! I have been going here for years with my family and I love the strawberry crepes and the hugely decadent \"apple pancake\".   I tried to call the restaurant for 2 1/2 hours to place a take-out order on a Saturday morning. 2 1/2 hours and the phone was not answered. Not one time. It just rang and rang. My daughter really wanted the apple pancake so I drove there to place my order. I told the woman behind the counter about the phone never being answered. I was told by a male server standing there that they \"don't answer the phone when it's really busy\". The woman said that wasn't true and apologized. She then said that sometimes people forget to hang up the phone. I explained how insane that was in terms of customer service. They didn't seem to be bothered in the least.   But the food is SO good!"}
{"text":"After having an embarrassing George Costanza-esque moment in the parking lot, I was hungry for some food and eager to find some shelter. Enter The Original Pancake House and their sweet, sweet tempting flapjacks. I'm not the biggest pancake person in the world, but this place has many options to appease anyone's taste-buds. They offer huge, fresh baked omlettes and french toast in addition to about twenty different varieties of pancakes.  Original Pancake House is, in the most TL;DR language possible, Ihop on steroids. You won't get flimsy bacon or bland discs of under-cooked dough here. You will get food that's seems as if it's injected with magic bundled with the quickness and variety you'll see at an Ihop. The bacon is thick and crisp, and the pancakes taste moist and fresh. I'd recommend the pumpkin pancakes because it's not only the season, but they are actually chocked full of real pumpkin. It's easy to just dump some McCormick pumpkin spice into pancake mix, but this place uses a real helping of pumpkin, so the pancake comes out as a delicious pie/pancake hybrid. In addition to the delicious food, the service is prompt and the coffee refills are on point. I wish I lived closer to the area, but I will surely be back."}
{"text":"It is really hard to find gluten free pancakes and this place has them!  They are delicious!!  The portions are huge, so a full stack is enough for at least two people.  When we visit Pittsburgh again, we will definitely be going here for breakfast.  I only have two cons about this place: 1) when you Google their address, it is listed on McKinght Rd., so we had difficulties finding it, but the address here on Yelp is correct. And 2) Our waitress was very friendly, but seemed forgetful when we asked her for refills on coffee, more creamer, more butter, etc."}
{"text":"I believe the children are our future. Future pancake servers. Good thing parents feel the need to indoctrinate this new generation of corporate slaves into the competetive world of egg cracking at a very young age. What I'm trying to say is... I work most Saturday nights. I never, never feel like doing brunch with my wife and her friends. I'm either already drunk from getting out at 6 or just passed out. And during football season, I just switch straight to Adidas pants upon arrival home and veg to the previous evening's dvr'd SNL and all day NFL talk on ESPN(enough initials for ya?) This particular Sunday something crawled up me arse and convinced me I need to do the Sunday brunch thing(the current hot trend among us thirty somethings). I remember Sunday brunches of my twenties where we would go to a greasy spoon in downtown Willoughby and the clientele was all hung over revelers and flea market goers. Church people, sort of. I wanted to relive this Walking Dead carrying small dishes of bacon experience and was harshly dropped into a western suburban strip mall procreation cacophony. Upon arrival I was swarmed by families, children, and Westgate goers. Unnerving to say the least.  I'm just setting the mood here, hang on. Once we were seated, the extremely cheery staff catered to our every whim. Great service. Coffee was top notch. The view of the back of all the other stores(dumpsters) left something to be desired. Especially compared to the Detroit streetscapes I've grown to adore at 56West or My Friends in Lakewood(kind of the reason I even moved out here). The decor included a cafeteria style seating area beneath Cleveland Clinic architecture(an abstraction of a giant fried egg skylight dealie). I had the continental crepes for around 7 bones and the wife had a veggie omelet with apparently free pumpkin pancakes which should have come ,in my mind, to a grand total of around 18 bucks tops. After consuming the hearty helpings of egg, the checkout process revealed the bill, with a fiver tip, to be in the neighborhood of 28 dollars. O_o     That's right, an emoticon in a review. The sticker shock kind of took whatever mellowness had ensued after the initial kindercare buzzkill. They charged extra for pumpkin pancakes, extra for egg whites, extra for this, extra for that, etc. Are we the kind of people to dispute a bill? No. It's Sunday for shit's sake. But if you think this is Denny's or Ihop or any other cheap pancake spot, think again. You will do some debit damage here for what amounts to gas station breakfast.  Reading other reviews, I tend to agree with other yelpers about the sterile environ, large portions and wait staff b.o.(don't ask). Did I enjoy it? I guess so. It was nice to just get out. but I really hope next time is a legit greasy spoon or Lakewood bloody mary hangout where kids aren't crawling under every table. Sorry, I just don't like kids. I thought on Sunday mornings they stayed home and watched Hickory Hideout. That's what I did at that age. But my parents were also complete shut ins, so whatever. And the featured pic of large bacon slices flopping over the side of the plate also made me laugh, because in reality they are that huge! I witnessed it firsthand. They also touched the table  which kind of grossed me out. Was that my fellow patron's bad? Probably. He didn't mind. He was talking to his kids in that inane baby talk all parents condescendingly pelt their children with while sipping from his thermos brought from home(??) Kids, please don't settle for this. Ignore your teachers, learn the way you want to learn, and when you hit twenty four move to Lakewood to eat at hip streetside diners while talking shit about the old losers in Twinsburg. That's where I'll be grabbing breakfast after I tire of the thirty something lifestyle, sell out, and buy a condo in the middle of nowhere. Circle of life."}
{"text":"Do you like pancakes? Then this place is for you.   Went at 10:00 am on a Saturday morning and the place was packed but only had a short wait.  I had choco chip pancakes (short stack) with a side of bacon.  They go crazy with the whipped cream, which is a good thing.  Bacon was nice and crisp and the portion was generous.  Our server was very nice.  Table was clean and the place looks tidy overall.   Definitely a great place for breakfast.    Decor is weird, though.  It doesn't look like a pancake house.  I am just wondering if the building was previously a German restaurant or steakhouse."}
{"text":"It is always a pleasant surprise when you can't read a restaurant by it's facade. This strip mall breakfast spot is pretty nondescript; from the outside you could as easily except to find mattresses lined up inside as opposed to dining tables.   As soon as you get in the door however, the restaurant takes on an slightly warmer atmosphere. The dining space is still pretty much one big open area, which lends itself to being a bit noisy, but the paint colors are warm and welcoming and reminded me a lot of a First Watch.   The menu though is much larger than First Watch. Since pancake is in the name of the place it's appropriate that there are over 20 varieties on the menu. Additionally there are egg entrees. Today I got to try both as all egg plates come with a side of three pancakes. I ordered the Eggs Benedict. I changed from the Canadian bacon to the regular bacon, which was cooked perfectly and had great flavor! The eggs were poached properly and all combined well with a slightly crunchy English Muffin. A side of red skin potatoes were seasoned well and still had some skin attached which was a nice touch.   For my pancake side I kept it simple with blueberry pancakes. These were served with a side of blueberry syrup. The pancakes were of good texture and weight. I was impressed that the small blueberries were evenly distributed through the entire pancake and did not come out the bottom of the pancake.   I also was impressed with the fresh squeezed OJ. I'd go back here. I'd like some more bacon. And I'd like to be more adventurous and try some other more decadent pancakes."}
{"text":"I have been there four times and have had a really good breakfast each time.  I love the coconut pancakes and their homemade whipped cream!!!  My kids love the Rainbow and Reese's pancakes.  I haven't tried the omelets yet, but they are huge and look great.  If you like breakfast, then you need to give this place a try.  Oh, the coffee is pretty good too."}
{"text":"This place is great!!! Best breakfast around town; the pancakes are out of this world! The portions are enormous."}
{"text":"really solid pancakes which is a must if its in the title. the most surprising and enjoyable thing was the omlets which are cooked in the oven so they have a toasty/crispy outershell and they look more like a shelless quiche then an omlett.   tip - SHARE - the portions are HUGE.   tip/question for the establishment - why do we pay at the front? is this a dennys? let your customers sit and finish their coffee while they wait for their change like any other restaurant ever."}
{"text":"OPH is great now that it is in it's new location inside GVR.  Sitting at the bar is the way to beat the crowds.  The food is good, hot, and big!  I had breakfast there before going out on the Red Riderz Turkey Run last weekend.  The coffee is really good, the waffles rock the house, and the bacon is just right and crispy.  Our waitress was sweet and rolled with our louder-than-usual staccato commentary.  OPH is the place for breakfast."}
{"text":"Our waitress Jenny was wonderful. The bacon!!!! Get a side of bacon. The servings are huge. Their gluten free pancakes are yummy."}
{"text":"I love, love this place. Now, it is a little on the expensive side, but it is well worth it. The last time I was there, I had the almond french toast. Absolutely amazing!!!  If you are hungry, get an omelet. They come in four egg or six egg. It's a breakfast fit for a King.  Yes, five stars for a breakfast place is odd, but it's always that good.  Even the coffee is fantastic."}
{"text":"Not a lot on the menu for veg lovers, but I did score with the spinach crepe and potato pancakes.  Unfortunately the pancakes were very tasty because they were loaded with the butter they had been fried in.  And the hollandaise sauce was creamy and cheesy, and loaded with fat calories.  Ok, so I wouldn't eat here every day, but it saved me hunting all over for something vegetarian I could eat."}
{"text":"They should stick to only making pancakes , the spinach omelette was dry and over cooked . I had to get some picante sauce to be able to eat it. And they charged me $1.50 for the sauce to eat the dried up omelette . There are several other breakfast places nearby that I prefer . I complained about charging me for the sauce and they could care less, 2 less customers for them."}
{"text":"Oh.  My.  Goodness.  When one of my breakfast companions said, \"I'll have a Dutch Baby,\" I was nonplussed.  What the &^%%$* was a Dutch Baby?  So I asked for one too.  It's a huge fried-cake thing and my GOSH it was good!   So was the service (very attentive with the coffee, bringing extra napkins, etc.). They were also very nice about us sitting forever and chatting.  On the down side:  whatever you do, sit at a table, not a booth.  We were offered a booth, and the upholstery had the consistency of a -- well -- a PANCAKE.  Imagine sitting in a bucket of soft foam rubber, with the table up to your chin.  So we asked for a table instead, and they cheerfully moved us.    I'm torn.  The food was four stars, definitely, but the booth was too much of an adventure.  Three stars.  (Something like that always makes me wonder uneasily what else is worn out or neglected.)  A solid A-OK for those pancakes, though.  Now I'm curious about the apple pancakes!"}
{"text":"I'm rating this on my most recent visit, in the past i would have given it a 5 though.  I ordered the veggie omelet with bacon pancakes, strange I know but the omelet sounded good and I wanted to try the idea of the bacon pancakes.  But anyway, back to my breakfast. The omelet was huge as they always are here, and very tasty no complaints there.  The pancakes were slightly better than ok.  i just felt knowing what else I've had here that they weren't up to par for what I expect.  In the past I had the Dutch Baby which is excellent, its been too long since I've had it to write a review on that though.  But my recommendation is to come hungry and order and omelet as they have a very nice selection, then since the omelet comes with pancakes sub the pancakes of your choice for the regular ones that come along and then you are able to try both the omelet and the pancakes."}
{"text":"I have been wanting to try this place since I moved out here, and was slightly disappointed by the food. I ordered the Michaels Eggs with potato pancakes (my fave) and was disappointed because the pancakes were no more than hashbrowns in a circular shape. Hubby got banana pancakes which I tried, and were good, but no more than just regular old pancakes with bananas on top. Where is the flavor? Anyway, service was great and the bill wasn't very much. Not a very long wait either for a Sunday brunch. Might be back if Eggworks down the road isn't insanely busy."}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite breakfast places to go. Every time we go on the weekend, there is always a wait but we get seated very quickly. We've now started to request Lindsey every time we go because she is always so sweet, happy, and gets our orders right every time. Service is spectacular, the staff is very friendly, never wait long for food even when it's busy. Their potatoes are TO DIE FOR!!!!!! This is one of my favorite breakfast places and we will return."}
{"text":"This place has wonderful food, but the hours (7-3PM) and the staff let it down.  As usual, I had forgotten about the long wait and empty drinks and tried it again to be reminded of what minimum wage buys.  The food is very good, the omelets are huge and served piping hot, the bacon pancakes are a MUST HAVE!  Get there for the food, and understand that the service will be poor at best."}
{"text":"Omelettes are amazing. The other stuff is ok but the omelettes are the best. Service is pretty good and if you park in the back of gvr is pretty convienant. Its a tough choice for breakfast over here with the cracked agg and hash house being so close."}
{"text":"Pancakes make me happy. They also make me fat, but that's a problem for another day.   This place has some damn good pancakes. I had the Georgia pecan pancakes, with a side of turkey sausage. The pancakes were amazing, and I'm pretty sure they make their own syrup. The sausage was almost scrapple-like, with the right amount of spice.   The short stack is enormous--three big pancakes--I have no idea what the full order would be.  Tip for the out of towner on finding this place--It's up the hill tucked in behind the Denny's (hard to see behind the mounds of snow that were present when I visited)."}
{"text":"My first visit and I enjoyed the oatmeal with sliced bananas.  The ice tea was fresh as well.  There are very few menu choices for vegans though so more for meat and egg eaters. Service was quick and friendly. Certainty worth a visit."}
{"text":"ACHE FOR PANCAKE ?   ME, TOO.  The objective in going here was to test their pancakes.  It had been several years since I'd had one---actually no more than 1/4 of one---maybe 3 times in my life.  I never enjoyed the hard-to-swallow, doughy mass, and figured it was just bad luck or bad restaurants.   Though I'll quickly admit that I'm probably a bit too particular about the way foods are prepared, I knew my aversion to the pancake---a breakfast bedrock---needed re-evaluation.     Regretably, however, upon scanning the myriad menu offerings---albeit, consisting of basically flour and eggs---the planned \"Pancake Taste Test\" was immediately postponed for a future visit.   Plan B superseded my best intentions.  DUTCH BABY  * * * * Described as a \"pancake\", but not really.  Of German heritage, it was more like a 10\" wide \"bowl\" of light, crispy 2\" high edges, with a flat 1/4\" thick, round base---a smooshed-down version similar to my french toast recipe.  Nicely flavored, with sides of whipped butter, powdered sugar, and 2 lemon wedges (!?).  Quite good, but because of it's richness could eat less than 1/3rd.  Would recommend as a 3 or 4 share, along with something else.  BELGIUM WAFFLE  * * * * * Served with whipped butter and syrup.  For about $2, purchased their small bottle of real maple syrup.  (Didn't test their other, but I've never tasted a pretender that I liked.)  Crispier than the ones I make---because their irons have a much deeper pattern---with a light and airy center.  What I wasn't expecting was the flavor, which was pretty good.  It reminded me of the yellow cones you get with ice cream.    \"DAILY'S\" BACON  * * * * *  Four thick-sliced 1.25\" x 6\"-7\" strips, at 4.29.   Not curled, but flat---like rulers.  I could easily see someone coming here for just this.  I'm not a bacon fanatic, but do have my preferences.  This may be the best in flavor and texture that I've ever had.   Snaps and cracks cleanly with no pull, and a crispy chew.   Perfect.  HOME FRIES  * * * * * * * * * * * * * * *  Hate that I love potatoes.   I've always enjoyed my veggies, but taters so near the top?  Sad.  Bad.  Make various potato dishes, including home fries.  Must say that these were very, VERY good.  And, I'll admit, better than mine.  Bits of sauteed onion and a sprinkling of a wonderful light seasoning.  HAD to ask.   (Sorry, but can't reveal.)  Caught her unawares as she was about to pass by at a quick clip.  She whispered it to me, but might have regretted doing so.   If you like them, too, you'll just have to use my stealthy technique on a busy, unsuspecting employee yourself.  COFFEE  * * * * * Strong...dark...full-bodied.  Real half and half.  Attentively re-filled.  Excellent.  STAFF  * * * * * Lawrence, Esmerelda (?) with an adorable foreign accent, a cook, and the one I took by surprise but really didn't mean to.   DECOR  * * * * A clean, stark, sun-lit bright, utilitarian interior---just the basics---to fit the bill of homey, Amish-like, breakfast fare.  Sitting there, looking around, I could somehow sense what it reminded me of, but was unable to bring it into sharper focus.  As if the intention---other than sensibly holding unnecessary design and decorating costs down---was to keep eyes from any distractions and centered on the food and each other.  Not until arriving at home did it instantly hit me.  It's like a big, deep, cardboard box.  That's not a bad thing, just what I'd compare it to.  Could imagine all the diners as well-cared for gerbils or hamsters, lovingly fed delicious morsels, and tended to by a giant, adoring 7-year-old, gazing down from way way above. .  Well worth visiting.  Must eventually test a good old traditional pancake.  Don't quite know how soon that will be because of a massive mound of vegetarian omelette that I couldn't take my eyes off a table away.  MY RECOMMENDATION:   I've noted in reviews that some menu items are not being identified correctly.  If you've never been here and are curious about what's offered, pull up their web site.  Prices aren't listed, but fall within 5.49 to 9.59, with sides .50 to 5.29.                                                     http://originalpancakehouse.com . ."}
{"text":"I had the omelet. It is cooked French style. It was alright...I like mine cooked American style!!! It was just to fluffy. I also had a side of their bacon. It was very very good. Service was ok. I went at 7:30 in the morning and it was dead. I expected better service"}
{"text":"After losing all your money at the penny slots, blacking out from drinking one too many apple-tini's; there's nothing more comforting than a sweet smile from an attentive waitress, hot coffee and cold oj to go along with a nice filling breakfast.   OPH served it all up, especially with a line way shorter than the one for the buffet. (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/p7RWwyP49cDwgvoK1Um8Mg?select=3Cnddjx72U0DVabeEzXKXw)  *German pancake aka Dutch Baby (signature dish) $10- Baked so it looks like a deflated popover. Coming sprinkled with powdered sugar, it was like a thick crepe with subtle sweetness. The lemon and butter they give you as a topping is interesting. Eating this dish is like eating at the buffet, so you could probably order the smaller size. (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/p7RWwyP49cDwgvoK1Um8Mg?select=UySg86682T1ALQZRoSSdfw)  Mushroom omelet - $10. They don't mess around. The thing is huge and can easily feed like 10 senior citizens. It's a little bit different from a standard omelet since they take the eggs, cook it in a skillet and then bake it. They even give you 3 buttermilk pancakes, which we couldn't even touch we were so full. (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/p7RWwyP49cDwgvoK1Um8Mg?select=ngoFBlaMQh9mXRES_mpU0Q)  The food is overflowing and hearty, 2 people can easily share one plate.  You're definitely going to need energy to get back to the slots, this food can put you to sleep."}
{"text":"Best breakfast place I've ever been to and could ever find.  Every time I'm in town I go here at least once.  It's my favorite.  Their omelets are phenomenal, their dutch baby's the best I've even found, their orange juice is fresh squeezed.  Oh and they have great new art every time I'm there.  You can't go wrong with this restaurant.  And any wait is worth the wait to eat here."}
{"text":"I had heard so many good things about this place so my husband and I were excited to finally try it. We stopped in on a Sunday after church around 1:15 or so, and there was a little bit of a wait, but it was a gorgeous day out so we didn't mind. We waited maybe 15 mins and were seated and greeted by our server quickly.   They had a large menu with a pretty good variety, so it was a little hard to make a decision. I wanted to try either the coconut waffle, or the Georgia pecan waffle, but the omelets looked so good that we decided to go with that instead. I ordered the seafood omelet that had a crab & shrimp mixture and was topped with hollandaise and spinach. My husband ordered the cheese and chorizo omelet. They both came with pancakes, which were nice and fluffy, and a good size for a side. I liked that the omelets were french rolled. It was different, unique, and well cooked.   Our server was very efficient and quick, we didn't have to wait long for our food, and the price was reasonable. (Just under $21 for two people.) Both of our meals were good- not great, but good. The atmosphere wasn't really my style. It was pretty loud, which is obviously because they were so busy, and the dining room just had tons of tables and chairs that were a little cramped together. I understand it helps them get more people in and out, but I personally don't like being so close to another table that we're practically touching.   All in all it wasn't a bad experience. They certainly didn't do poorly either in service or food quality. It just wasn't so amazing that we are dying to go back any time soon. Not a bad place, just not our favorite."}
{"text":"Visiting the area and drove by this place one night. It was closed but we went for breakfast in the morning. Very pleasant staff and as always with The Original Pancake House their Apple Pancake was out of this world. My husband also got the Chorizo Omelet which was good. Portions are very large and we had left overs. Will absolutely come here again when I'm in the area."}
{"text":"Hungover and hungry for breakfast?  This place won't disappoint. Portions: HUGE Prices: fair Service: fine  I shared the biscuits with sausage and poached egg smothered in mushroom sherry gravy. It was definitely enough food for two people. The potato pancakes should be eaten with their chilled apple sauce. That combo was kind of great. I had never eaten potato pancakes before. The gravy was a bit too heavy, but had a nice flavour to it.  I couldn't say anything was particularly original about their food, but it certainly filled me up."}
{"text":"This place is always pretty solid.  Prior to my most recent visit, I've probably been here 5 or 6 times and I don't think I've ever been disappointed.  In fact, I've only tasted one bad menu item and it was an omelette that my friend ordered!  This go round, I went super simple and just got a strawberry waffle and 2 eggs.  The strawberries were fresh cut, not that syrupy strawberry mush that most places serve.  (I was very clear about not wanting that.)  My friend had their German pancake or \"Dutch Baby\" and I might get that on a future trip.  It was actually pretty thin despite the fact that it comes out looking like a bread bowl.  My friend's husband had an omelette of some variety and we all marvelled at how huge it was.  Then I marvelled at how he managed to put most of it down!   Service was fine, he didn't go above and beyond. Nor did we require that.  Their prices are decent and there was a lively crowd on a Tuesday, late morning.  It's definitely worth checking out and I always recommend it for breakfast. Pro tip: their bananas foster french toast is a win!"}
{"text":"Forget IHOP forever... This place has the BEST buckwheat pancakes!!! Believe me, buckwheat pancakes are hard to find in most restaurants that serve breakfast. So, when I saw them on the menu, I was ecstatic!!! Order up, with a side of smoked apple wood bacon and a cuppa coffee.   The coffee was excellent & bottomless. It took some time to get served after we ordered. Surprising, because the restaurant was not too full, it was a Tuesday around 11am. Once our order arrived, the portions were huge!! The pancakes filled the size of the plate. I spread on a little butter, and doused the plate with maple syrup, and dug in... MMMMMM ... EXCELLENT!! Buckwheat is a very hearty flour, dark in color with a distinctive taste of sweet rye. The bacon was in 3-4 huge, thick strips - fried crispy. SO good!!   When we left, we could have rolled out the door - - we were so full!!   Aside from the usually long wait on the food and the mediocre atmosphere -- my only other complaint is the prices & hours. They were a tad more expensive than some of the chain breakfast restaurants and they are only open until 2pm every day.  I happen to LOVE a hearty breakfast at dinnertime!! But, I'm sure they do 80% of their business on the weekends (and after church).  I will definitely return to try other unusual pancakes -- like bacon pancakes or chocolate chip pancakes... OR maybe I'll venture over to the egg dishes or sandwiches.. NOT!! A place named the Original Pancake House will only get all my pancake orders!!!  :)"}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite places to eat breakfast. The quality of food is superb, the staff is phenomenal. The food portions? Let's just say you won't leave there hungry.  The bacon is the best in the city. A little pricey but well worth it. This place diffently DON'T sacrifice quality just to save a buck?"}
{"text":"I pass this place every time I'm in Fairview Park and finally was able to make plans to check it out. Sort of unassuming from the outside (and inside). Just some decorations on the wall, and plenty of seating space.  We went on a Monday morning, and it was pretty empty when we first got there (around 9:30am), which is what we basically expected. However, a half hour later, we were very surprised to see the place completely packed with some people waiting. CLEARLY, this place is THAT good if it's full on a weekday!   I had a hard time ordering because the menu is HUGE and everything looks delicious! Interestingly enough, I ended up ordering one of the few items that does NOT come with pancakes. They don't sell them a la cart either, you have to get 3 of them, which kind of stinks, but is understandable. I had the huevos rancheros (beans, with eggs- i got them scrambled and white, their green chili, cheese and avocado). Oh my goodness, was this dish DELISH!! I didn't even touch the tortilla it came with because of how TASTY the dish was and how occupied I was with eating it. Usually, I pour a ton of hot sauce on whatever breakfast egg dish I am eating, but their green chili sauce was so flavorful and had a nice kick to it, that I didn't need to! The dish came with their home fries and I added cheese and, holy moly, were the potatoes AMAZING. At the beginning of the meal, I said to myself, \"I'll only have a bite or two of the potatoes\" to save calories. Yeah, that did not work out as well as I had hoped once I tasted the potatoes. They were basically all gone by the end of the meal.  To drink, I ordered the coffee, and the waitress was pretty good about refilling when it was close to being empty. The service was okay. We did have to flag ours waitress down a few times to get things since she wasn't coming by often, but overall she seemed friendly, just also seemed a bit inpatient.   As far as pricing goes, it's decently priced, but every little change. coffee (don't think plain coffee should cost close to 3 dollars), etc starts tacking on the dollars really fast. And suddenly, your once 10 dollar bill is no longer that low.  Overall, amazing food! and I WILL be back :)"}
{"text":"Everything here is fresh and good. Today I got the short stack of buckwheat cakes with applesauce. I asked my waitress if they would be as good as Mom's and she said absolutely we are amazing here... She was right, fluffy, flavorful and just enough. Ill be back..."}
{"text":"We go here sometimes when we don't feel like going far. The food is ALWAYS good and there is enough of it to make you full. This time around, we had a coupon to use so we made use out of it. We got two nice filling entrees for a quick meal. I got a spinach omelette with three pancakes and my husband got an egg entree with three pancakes. We will be back !!"}
