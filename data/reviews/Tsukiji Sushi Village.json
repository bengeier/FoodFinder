{"text":"One of our local favorites. We probably pick-up take out a couple times a month. Banana Tempura is great and I love the special sushi combo. They can do the brown rice paper on rolls which the kids like."}
{"text":"My preferred Sushi spot in Markham but a level below the better GTA Sushi places. Enjoy many things but the Rolls are the best. Will say... I find the Sashimi average but everything else is good. You also get a free roll with multiple visits. The staff is great."}
{"text":"Another Chinese-run Japanese restaurant in Markham.   Fresh / good quality food, although not as authentic as a few of the downtown joints I've been to that are operated by real Japanese sushi masters, still better than most AYCE.   The special combo that's called \"Lobster Sashimi dinner for 2\" is a lot of food for $45. You get soup, salad, a small lobster sashimi-style, a small sashimi combination plate, some type of sushi roll, shrimp and veggie tempura, choice of lamb or beef sirloin chops, a side order of stir fried vegetables, rice and green tea ice cream dessert. Note this is a cash-only price, although the restaurant does take credit cards.   Lamb chops were well executed, tender and moist, just the right done-ness.   Service is okay compared to other Chinese restaurants.   I deducted one star for their poor math skill. The special combo came with green tea ice cream; after consulting the stars my sign pointed to black seasame flavour ice cream instead. \"That will be $3 extra per person to upgrade\" said the nice waitress. Errrr, chotto matte kudasia, the menu says an order of black seasame costs a whole dollar more than the other flavours, so where is your math?"}
{"text":"We recently moved to Markham and decided to try this place out of the blue without reading any reviews. We are happy with the service, ambiance and food. We particularly like the golden salmon roll (cooked salmon) and the calamari. It isn't anything amazing but compared to other sushi places it is a decently priced restaurant and we are now regulars there."}
{"text":"This place is top notch and a gem in the land of boring places to eat. Sushi is some of the best with fresh fish, great rice and lots of selection. Staff are very friendly and take out orders are welcome and they never make a mistake, at least with us. They take the time to read back your order very carefully. I also like that for some dishes, they wait until you arrive to cook the last bit of the take out order to ensure maximum crispness in something like tempura. If your not into sushi then try out there other menu items and specials."}
{"text":"I found Tsukiji Sushi Village food is similar to the AYCE quality... or maybe just a little better...   Valentine Day's Special Set Dinner for 2 ($40)  - I really not crazy about eating Valentine's Special anything anywhere.. but on this special day you either eat at home or if you go to any restaurant aside from fast food.. they will have some specials...  - Lobster Sashimi is quite tasty  - That Beef Teriyaki is the thinnest slice of beef I ever seen.. and I want to laughed when thinking that the waitress how I would like them to cook.. no other way to cook when they are really paper thin!  - Shrimp and Veggie Tempura quite sizable, the best item for the set  - Sashimi and lobster sushi roll not bad...but forgettable   BTW, my valentine was still hungry after our Valentine Dinner. Maybe I should just go to have AYCE then!   Tsukiji Sushi maybe a good choice if you are in the neighbourhood.. but doesn't worth the drive all the way North."}
{"text":"I love Tusikiji's dinner for 2 because it has everything I love for $49.99.  We started off with a simple Japanese salad and miso soup, followed by tempura shrimp and vegetables, featuring the typical yam and zucchini. Although I would've liked a larger variety of vegetables (like squash and eggplant), these were still pretty satisfying.   The meal also included dynamite rolls and California Rolls. Rolls are my favorite part of a Japanese meal! It's pretty hard to mess up dynamite rolls and California rolls, and these were predictably delicious.   Assorted sashimi was also tasty and pretty typical. Finally, chicken fried udon was really addictive and super flavourful. Even though I was pretty full by the time it arrived, I managed to demolish a good portion of it.   The last course was a scoop of green tea ice cream, which was a sweet but not overwhelming end to the meal. This dinner for 2 included a whole lot food and we miraculously finished everything! It had everything that I generally want in a Japanese meal: salad, rolls, sashimi, tempura, and green tea ice cream! Although nothing was really spectacular or novel in any way, the food was well-executed and I enjoyed every course."}
