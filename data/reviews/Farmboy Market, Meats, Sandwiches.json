{"text":"This is my new favorite restaurant. Simply delicious, fresh food, with a friendly, welcoming staff."}
{"text":"Very good first impression. I was in a hurry to get lunch and there were a few people ahead of me, but they kept things moving and got me my delicious food very quickly. I had their BBQ pulled pork sandwich and green chile stew on the side and loved it. Top notch food and service could not be more friendly. Good luck, Farmboy!"}
{"text":"My coworker just picked up chicken and mushroom soup and salads for us there. The soup was so oily and there was a 2 inch chicken bone in it, thank God I examined it before I put it in my mouth and choked on it!  The salad was meh and their dressings were extremely watery. I know I won't recommend to any of my clients as I work right across the street."}
{"text":"We have eaten twice at Farmboy in the past week for dinner and both times the food was exceptional. On our first visit I had a egg sandwich with white cheddar and crispy pork. My eggs were cooked perfectly. I'm so happy they serve breakfast all day. My husband had The Boss: AZ Cheeseburger Sliders with potato salad which he enjoyed. We ate there again last night. This time I had the AZ Farmboy Sliders with their slaw and it was very good. My only complaint would be their ketchup isn't what I expected. It's obviously homemade and probably healthier than store bought ketchup but I found it to be runny and would have preferred Heinz. My husband had the Verde Valley Cheesesteak with potato salad and he loved it. The decor at Farmboy is nice and the place is clean. The service is amazing. They are very friendly and both times we were there the manager (maybe the owner) came over to check on our meal. When we eat out we like going to places that not only have very good food but exceptional service and Farmboy has  both. We will definitely be returning."}
{"text":"This is our new favorite spot for breakfast. The food is both local and priced well. I had an omelet with chili, and coffee. Everything was excellent"}
{"text":"Great breakfast. Can't wait to come back for lunch and dinner. Love the locally sourced food!"}
{"text":"Absolutely delicious. Everything was fresh and homemade with ingredients that are local. They have fancy sodas, and, the water is non-GMO AND organic. Unknown if it was gluten free."}
{"text":"So tasty! Breakfast for $4.99! What?! Really enjoyed the burnt ends and goat cheese spread. Service was awesome and the interesting fountain drinks are so yummy!"}
{"text":"Stopped in on a whim this afternoon and was blown away! Had the yummiest chicken salad wrap...the chicken was smoked and it was absolutely delicious! I had a cucumber, tomato, onion and balsamic salad for a side, and the flavors were outstanding.  Their \"tractor sodas' are super good too, and I'm not even a \"soda person!' Basically, it's soda water mixed with all kinds of fresh ingredients.  I got the cucumber one, and a cherry cream for my daughter.  Soooo refreshing, and I can't recommend this place highly enough.  Oh, and their fresh peaches at the farm stand when you walk in.... CRAZY good and juicy!  Easy five stars.  I'll be a regular here."}
{"text":"This was a nice little find for lunch. Farmboy is a fast-casual restaurant and mini marketplace located in a popular spot that was once operated by Paradise Bakery. They specialize in sandwiches that use wood-smoked meats that are nice and tender because of the slow cooking process. In fact, the moment you walk into the restaurant you get a nice BBQ smell that immediately draws you in. All the meats, produce and bread are locally sourced here in Arizona. The restaurant itself isn't incredibly large but has both indoor and outdoor patio seating. The ambience is casual and the walls are decorated with beautiful photos of various landscapes in Arizona that pay homage to our great state. The sandwiches are made from scratch and use only the quality portions of the smoked meats. One thing that is unique is that they are named after different locations in Arizona. Some of the names include the Verde Valley, Lake Powell, Alma School, Coconino and San Tan. If you are a native like myself, you will get a kick out of it. I ordered the Pinetop Beef and Chicken sandwich and thought it was amazing. In addition to the delicious smoked meats, the sandwich is topped with a spicy mayo and honey BBQ sauce that really make a nice blend of flavor. You have a variety of sides to choose from to go with your sandwich. Farmboy also has a small marketplace that you can purchase locally grown fruits, vegetables, eggs, milk (Danzeisen) and meats. They serve breakfast as well in the mornings. If you live in Chandler and are wanting to eat and buy local, this is the place to go. Farmboy is a nice addition to the area."}
{"text":"such a cute little place i had the bbq beef sandwich which they only have fridays and saturday's and it was so good. the meat was juicy it didn't even need any bbq sauce. their sourdough bread which you can buy rolls of there was also delectable. definitely coming back."}
{"text":"We strolled by here on accident and were pleasantly surprised. The potato salad was one of the best I've had ever. I also had the brisket sandwich with caramelized onions, grilled peppers, jack cheese, and spicy mayo - and it was phenomenal! We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"I haven't had anything here that I don't like! All the soups have been awesome, my favorite is the pulled pork sandwich, and the potato salad. Great concept and people."}
{"text":"Tried Farmboy tonight for dinner and was not impressed. Had the meatloaf sandwich and it was disappointing. Dry, not a lot of flavor. One piece was a solid slice of meat, the other side was crumbled meat. The side of grilled veggies were ok and the Mac and cheese was a little dull in flavor. Maybe they need a little more time perfecting the menu? I won't be rushing back any time soon that's for sure. Love the concept of the place but the food was a big disappointment."}
{"text":"Overall this is a great new place that I hope is successful for a very long time. Everything we've had there tastes amazing and you can tell it's fresh. I think my favorite so far is coming in for the Sunrise Breakfast and adding burnt ends with the prickly pear hot sauce. Very tasty. I would recommend you look at the menu and know what you want prior to approaching the counter.

[edit]
The owner and staff are beyond friendly and helpful!"}
{"text":"Cute!!! Very very cute concept! It's original and haven't seen anything like this around so it's exciting. They sell fresh milk and fruits and veggies picked from their personal farm and I must say the tiny peaches are the juiciest peaches I've ever had. So we ordered and it took a while before we got our food, with no other customers I was surprised how long it took. Our food was just good I wouldn't say excellent. My chicken sandwich was good but it was almost cold barely warm that would be my only complaint. I am looking forward to this place ironing out the wrinkles. I will be back in a few months to revisit."}
{"text":"Wow! This place knows quality & how to smoke meats! They care about the food they are serving. We ordered 5 items & our tastebuds were pleasantly surprised. The inside is a little small... I can see this place having a line out the door! Thank you for opening! Your new fans in Gilbert!"}
{"text":"Wow, great quality food I thought.The food was great and people there were awesome. A little pricey, good portions,also the food is of higher quality and you can tell without a doubt."}
{"text":"Nice addition to the neighborhood. For MEAT lovers. First, the place is super cute and has seating in and out. The staff is very eager to help- and it's brand new, so they are still gettng their sea legs a bit but running a good ship. This place is really for meat lovers, they do have a couple of salads and a breakfast menu. For vegetarians- there is a veggie burger sandwich and a grilled cheese sandwich, plus veggie chili. I had the grilled cheese sandwich -but ungrilled. It was loaded with veggies that I chose from their menu. The roll was like a ciabatta but not as big, it was very good bread. All the sandwiches come with a pickle and a side you choose from a list of ten. I had the smoked oyster mushrooms - go figure, these were among the best mushrooms i ever had. they were warm and tasted as if they had been poached in a chicken broth maybe, they were meaty and punchy and delicious. Next time I'll have them put them on a sandwich instead of as a side. Also, my sandwich came with vegetarian chili, which was mild and very good. A ton of food for the $. So give the Farmboy crew a chance. You can also buy farm fresh fruit, veggies, eggs, milk, etc at their mini farmstand store when you walk in."}
{"text":"I love this place! Lots of great, locally sourced options. I stopped in to pick up some fresh deli meats for home. The smoked roast beef was delicious. Lots of options on the menu that I can't wait to try. Service was warm and friendly. I will say that there isn't much of a \"market\" yet but sounds like they have big plans as they continue to grow. Looking forward to stopping in again very soon."}
{"text":"Came in around 2:30pm for a late lunch. Made my own pulled pork sandwich and ordered the sliders off the kids menu. The food came out quickly. The pulled pork was delicious and did not taste dry at all. The BBQ sauce helped me scarf down the pork and before I knew it, it was done. 

The sliders were dry. Told them they should cook the beef to a medium rare instead of medium well and the sliders would be delicious. The staff was great. They were always checking to see if I needed anything and asked if I wanted the sliders redone. 

I had the vegetable soup as well, which tasted a little bland. 

The cucumber soda was amazing though. Will come back and try their breakfast menu."}
{"text":"We decided to give this place a try yesterday for lunch.

It's bright, cheery, very clean and cute!

Hubby and I split a chopped brisket sandwich with the spicy BBQ sauce and a side of potato salad.  The bun was fresh and flavorful with just enough bite.
The brisket was very nicely seasoned and prepared, with the only drawback being that it was served at room temperature (we were expecting a warm sandwich).
The potato salad was some of the best I've had.

I really enjoyed the refreshing lavender green tea.

Give this new family-
owned and operated business a chance!"}
{"text":"Excellent Customer Service is often compared to receiving good service from a friend.
In fact, it's that type of hospitality that will keep me coming back to FARMBOY's again. 

The brisket was tender and the smoke flavor was authentically delicious. It tastes like they smoke with applewood though the smell that lead me from my orthodontist's office to FARMBOY's smelled like mesquite -- or so I thought. It smelled so good that I passed up my parked car and walked the entire shopping center until I found the establishment responsible. FARMBOY's is the tasty culprit. As big as the smell and the taste of the food was the genuinely-friendly customer service was much bigger. 

Will I be visiting again? Farmboy employee, Jessica had the friendliest relative conversation. I'm from Dallas, TX and after Jessica said \"y'all\" a few times, I started feeling at home. I don't stray too far from home or from friends so I will definitely dine at FARMBOY's again."}
{"text":"We went for a team lunch and wanted to try this new place. The staff informed us it has been open for 3 weeks. 

I tried their signature sammie - the pintetop that had beef and chicken with a spicy mayo. The way my roll was cut was a little strange, it felt like a corner piece and made it awkward to eat. The tomatoes were better than the beef as I fond the cubed beef to be a little too dry. Other folks ordered the salad/soup combo (Veggie chili and chicken salad) She only finished half the soup and half the salad. We also tried the chicken salad sandwich and that seemed to be a better hit. Sad to report that the mac and cheese didn't really taste cheesy at all. My assumption is that they were trying to go for a more \"healthy\" approach with whole grain pasta and less cheese, just shredded cheese on top, but it just was not the same. 

It was pretty packed by the time we left and the design and staff were more impressive than their lunch menu. I totally get that this counter service restaurant is new so they are working to find their grooves. I might entertain the idea of trying it again since it is so close to work but again, would not rush out to recommend this place."}
{"text":"Okay, first I want to get the only negative comment out of the way; there is not much seating inside. Other than that I would give this place 10 stars. The menu is small but diverse (if that makes any sense). Soups, salads, sandwiches, and some sides in addition to breakfast. The ambiance is casual and convivial. The smell is intoxicating. The service is friendly and comes with a smile. The food is outrageous. And the soda (I am not a soda person but I had to give there selection a try) is on-point. I stopped in with a few buddies for lunch on the recommendation of yelp and it did not disappoint. Upon entering you are greeted with the smell of meat smoking. Of course all that can do is whet your appetite and make you impatient while standing inline. I decided to make my own sandwich as opposed to ordering one of the House specials: I got pulled pork and chopped brisket with pickle chips, white onions, and spicy bbq sauce. For my side I chose mac n cheese. First, the side was very light and was not rich. As a side I enjoyed the taste because it was very subdued and I took that as a sign the ingredients were fresh and real. The sandwich was pretty large but not too big. The meat was done perfectly and had so much taste it was unreal. I would venture to say it's because they source only local and sustainable meats. I typically get lethargic and feel nasty after eating bbq but this meat did not affect me that way so I could tell it was of high quality. One of my friends got the burnt ends as a side. Holy smokes! This is the only place I have found that do it right: dry like beef jerky and almost to the point of looking visibly inedible but full of so much flavor and texture. The soda selection was interesting: cherry vanilla, farm coke, cucumber, blood orange, and pomegranate if I remember correctly. All good in my opinion. They also sell local produce such as veggies, honey, dairy, and the like. I seriously just found my new favorite bbq and sandwich joint in The Valley."}
{"text":"Woohoo!  We tried another new place, Farmboy Market, Meats, Sandwiches.  Boy that's a mouthful, I'm just going to go with Farmboy's!  My wife and I came here for breakfast, she tried the Sourdough Sausage Sandwich with \"White Cheddar Cheese\" and I tried the Flour Tortilla Steak Burrito.  They were fantastic, amazing, ummmm running out of adjectives, splendid.  My wife and I like spicy so we asked for the hot sauce, their hot sauce was amazing.  \"Bid Red's Hot Sauce\"!  A moment please, I love to go to the Farmers Market in \"Tukee\" off of Warner and just west of the 10. I buy this hot sauce at that Farmer's Market.  

The whole principle of this place is to have local farm fresh ingredients.  The hot sauce is proof!  

Well done Farmboy's, well done!"}
