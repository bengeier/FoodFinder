{"text":"My girlfriend and I love Chinese food specially lunch specials.  Cafe Noodle does have the best lunch specials.  Price is cheap and food is delicious but like any other Chinese restaurant, customer service is a little off."}
{"text":"The Cafe noodle restaurant is where we go when we have guests in town. The service is super fast and the food is great. We always order the house noodles, salt and pepper shrimp, the roast duck, and the crispy chicken."}
{"text":"We've been going for here for a few months regularly and keep coming back because the food is really good and really affordable. If they don't give you one ask for the special menu with prices from $4.95-$8.95. This place has the best fried chicken with crispy skin and moist juicy meat for $6 for a whole chicken. Yeah, a whole fried chicken. We always order orange chicken, Singapore noodles and xo green beans. The beef dishes we've had were yummy too. They could do with a thorough cleaning starting with the bathrooms and table tops and some remodeling too."}
{"text":"horrible experience ! This restaurant makes us feel like they are dishonest. One waitress appears very very sneaky.  This was our third visit and our waitress was very rude. she talked to us with disrespect and treated us like crap,! we just sat down and wanted to have a peaceful dinner. then when she handed us our bill which  we found out that the waitress added a few dollars tip without informing the us.  She wrote the amount on our bill! this place is very dishonest. Hiw can they write their own tip onto customer bills without telling the,? we are never going back there again. if you want to risk going there, make sure you check the bill for every item....do not be fooled!"}
{"text":"Cheap menu, food is just OK. Good enough for its price. Service could be worked on."}
{"text":"Came here for dinner with my family on a Friday. The inside is pretty big and can seat a good number of parties. Overall a very average HK style restaurant.

Price- The dinner prices are more typical of the Bay Area, but is a bit pricey compared to other Chinese places in Vegas.

Service- We were seated immediately after we came in. The waitress was nice and came by once in a while to refill our water and to see how the food was.

Food- Very average. The Chicken with Ginger and Onion Sauce and the House Special Pan Fried Noodle were the 2 that stood out and the ones I would recommend trying. Both had enough flavor and tasted delicious. The Seafood Soup and the Seafood Fried Rice, however, needed work. Both were bland and definitely needed more seasoning. I ended up mixing the ginger/onion sauce with the fried rice; 100x better after that happened. They also gave us complimentary white rice, but I'm not sure if that happens for everyone or it depends on what ypu order.

On a side note, their tea cups were kind of dirty and sticky, so make sure to wipe it off a bit with napkins before using. Also, my dad and brother-in-law said the men`s restroom was extremely dirty. The women's one wasn`t that bad though."}
{"text":"The Salt & Pepper pork chops and Hong Kong Style Noodles are good.  They have a cheap lunch menu but make sure you ask for it because if you don't, they'll give you the regular menu.  They are also open very late as well.  Cheers."}
{"text":"Food: 
food was good, not great. 

Price: 
more expensive than other restaurants I've been to. 

Service: 
The guy who took my order (take out) seemed too serious and uptight, but the woman who gave me my order was friendly. 

Overall, would not come back."}
{"text":"Chinese food was the last thing I'd be eating in Vegas. Afterall, Honolulu's got some great places. But nonetheless, I found myself here for a family dinner and it was very good. We feasted pretty good that night...noodles, duck, chicken, veggies...everything was tasty and good.

It's definitely worth a visit if you're in the area."}
{"text":"Me and my family ate here a few days ago for the first and last time. We were seated pretty quickly (less than 5 min). They had 2 people working the floor: taking orders, cleaning and bringing the food out. It was quite busy, lunch time. The server was super RUDE!! She was trying to rush us to order. Food is pretty good, but the service is really bad. When it was time to pay, the lady said tip included, which was 18%. We asked why? We told her that usually applies to parties of 8 or more, then she said well if you want it's up to you. (We were only 4) We said NO tip. As I'm looking at my bank account, she charged tip. I clearly put $0 on the tip line and circled the total which was like $56. Clearly I WILL NOT BE EATING HERE EVER AGAIN!!!"}
{"text":"Food is pretty good for late night Chinese eatery which is always a good option. It's not a place that I normally come back too especially for late night eating there are better places that I would choose for late night Chinese eating!"}
{"text":"Came here for cheap chinese food.  I do not recommend this place. I would go to Joyful down the street over this. 

Average Food Cost/person:
$12

Food:  
Palatable -  Shrimp pan fried noodle Hong Kong style (shrimps on the smaller side)

Skip - Salt and pepper pork chop (barely any meat mostly fat)
Curry beef brisket (connective tissue, beef was tender, lacking in flavor)

Environment:  Not very clean - table was sticky, walls dirty, chairs old and worn

Service:  Very poor - waited 20 minutes for food. One of our dishes came 10 minutes after that. Outside of ordering and dropping off, no interaction with the wait staff."}
{"text":"An old restaurant renovate?everything is new?but food still gorgeous and price also reasonable?highly recommend Peking duck?salty fish steam meat pan cake?wonton noodle also good.
Service have passion and they anticipate your needs?this is really surprise me.
Its a Cantonese restaurant?serving chaozhou and Cantonese cuisine?highly recommend and i will definately back"}
{"text":"If there is none star I would give them 0. First we went in around 3pm which is lunch spacial time they didn't even give us the menu n the water taste like tap water..
The noodle soup we orders taste like shit..... Don't come"}
{"text":"Ordered 3 things off the menu, all of which they did not have. The waitress did not check on us in between ordering and paying, the hot tea sucked. It should be called Cafe Poodle."}
{"text":"Great. You can tell they use good cuts of meat and make everything fresh to order. Friendly fast service,  clean restaurant!"}
{"text":"if you didn't know. dirty dining 4x. last aired on 07/25/16.  do not eat there! do not eat there! do not eat there!! Unless you like raw chicken hanging over uncooked shrimp (vomit)."}
{"text":"The food is good, especially the Beef Vermicelli HOT POT! However, our experience with customer service was absolutely horrible! my husband and i waited for our food for over twenty five minutes while three seperate couples walked in, and ordered their meals, and received failry large meals within minutes before we received our food. Naturally, my husband and i thought it was do to the entrees we ordered, but, in viewing the entrees others ordered, we were correct in our first thought, the waiter did not put in our order to the chefs in a timely manner, nor did he apologize for the delay. it seemed he, and another waitress were more concerned with their customers of choice. Our drink of choice were never refilled (iced tea), while others were.The waiters were for more interested in those that spoke their foreign language. we never recieved any type of attention, other than to pay for our check. Without going into a longer comment, i will say that if you are looking for respect, even fair customer service, and a clean establishment then i suggest you find another eatery because you will be disappointed."}
{"text":"Hidden in a strip mall is the Cafe Noodle, good, cheap, fast, late night-friendly fare. There are two menus, one less expensive than the other (and there is also a paper takeout menu). Being cheap bastards, we always order from the smaller menu. We had 4 entrees for $24: kung pao chicken, beef with green onions, orange chicken, and salt-and-pepper pork chops were all fine and served with hot tea and white rice. The portions are ample for the price.

Some menu items just don't translate well into English, you'll find many dishes with names like \"beef with pickled pig intestines.\" We skip those.

Asians will get somewhat better service than whites here, but I've seen worse."}
{"text":"I'll make this short and simple: it was good! Regardless of the bad media it received, this place still delivered. Although I stopped coming here for a while after that incident, as soon as I came back, I thought the food was still great. People might think I'm crazy but I believe this place serves one of the best Chinese food here in town. 

Quick rundown of what we ordered:
Salt and pepper fish- I love it! Ive tried it at other places and did not like it! It actually has flavor here! Eat it before it gets soggy though or it won't taste as good!
Seafood panfried noodle- Great flavor, one of my favorites here. But it could've used a little bit more sauce and more seafood!
BBQ duck and pork- The guy ordered this and he loves the BBQ duck but mentioned that the pork was a wee dry. 
Red bean with crushed ice drink- It was ok, nothing to get excited about. I guess it could've been a bit sweeter.

The portions are decent and prices are somewhat reasonable. Each dish cost over 10 bucks. They do offer lunch and late night specials though so prices then are cheaper.
The service was actually pretty good. I guess because we're regulars here and it wasn't as busy at the time. Overall, it was money well-spent."}
{"text":"3.5 stars.  Good, authentic cantonese cuisine while in Vegas when you're tired of all the usual casino buffets..."}
{"text":"The place looked nice. Reading past reviews it seemed like it was renovated. Food wise...was alright. I ordered chicken w black bean sauce. The chicken didn't taste fresh and the vegetables were undercooked. I also ordered vegetarian rolls, those were actually pretty good. Other than that, I don't really have much to say. It's an affordable, decent restaurant."}
{"text":"Cheap, tasty Chinese food in the Asian ghetto just off the Strip.  It may not be the best Chinese food ever, but it's the best I've had so far in Vegas.  The chow fun in particular for only 4.99 is a must-have."}
{"text":"Just visited Cafe Noodle tonight. Good food and reasonable prices. The restaurant itself isn't much to look at, seems a little sloppy to me but can't complain. The tung choy was delicious.. veggies and rice were great and the main course was even better. I will definitely be back soon. Real chinese food at a great price!"}
{"text":"It's freezing in Vegas. So decided to have a hot noodle soup. I'm glad to stop by this Chinese restaurant near Chinatown. My vegetable & egg noodle soup was only $3.95! Also tried their BBQ ducks (crunchy outside and juicy inside) and house fried rice (flavor and taste were amazing!). All staff were very friendly. Will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Me and three friends happened to be in the area so we decided to try a restaurant nearby.  Since this restaurant had pretty good reviews on Yelp, we decided to try it.  We were seated immediately on a Tuesday afternoon.  The restaurant is basically a big room with several tables so no privacy if you wanted it.  But it would be good for groups.  We ordered two appetizers (crispy fried shrimp and salt and pepper chicken wings) and three entrees (shrimp fried rice, shrimp chow mein, kung pao chicken) to share.  The best tasting items were the appetizers but the food in general was ok.  It wasn't until after we paid and left that one of my friends mentioned that he saw a baby roach!  I'm still harrassing him about why he didn't tell us while we were eating, but needless to say I won't be eating here again."}
{"text":"Myself and the boys I work with come here for lunch. Their lunch specials are crazy cheap, $4.95 and there's a big menu with items to choose from. I always get the black pepper beef with soft noodles. YUM! The other boys get chicken with crispy noodles (I always steal his bok choy), sweet and sour chicken and salt and pepper pork. There is always at least 4 of us that go and with our food, drinks and rice for the table our bill is never more than 30 bucks total!! So worth it."}
{"text":"This was my first time, I had higher than normal expectations. I think because of Big Wong!
My overall time there was good.
My first impression was good
My beef and broccoli tasted good 
My service was good
After the first dish I was hungry but there is no desert, so I ordered orange chicken it was terrible !
I might go back, not sure?
I just remembered unfortunately they are serving chilled water from the tap, poor aftertaste sorry."}
{"text":"Worst food and service, I asked them to bring me an ice water 3 times, I have to go get the menu by myself, the answer was They are busy, it was only 3 tables with 2 servers,how busy would be?  and every time I went always see the woman counted her money for 30 mins, \"Don't go to this place\", the staff speaks loud with bad words in front of the guest.."}
{"text":"this is another one of my favorite hole in the wall places, particularly chinese food.  this turns out to be owned by the former owners of Food Express (another great chinese food place), so this place is good for Cantonese food, not for ambiance or good service.  I'm not an expert, but i think i've been to enough Chinese food places that i can say what's good or not good.  i always have to order the house special hong kong style panfried noodle.  i love this for the crispy egg noodles smothered with sweet bbq pork, soft scallops, moist chicken, and crunchy Chinese broccoli, but last night the noodles didn't have any crisp at all, i assume it sat too long.   we also had the bbq duck, salty from the soy evened out with the sweetness of the plum sauce.  it is an absolute must to order any of the salt-pepper items.  last night, i had the salt-pepper pork chop. the flavor was so good on those moist pieces of pork chop.  i also recommend the salt-pepper squid.  finally, it's a must to order the crispy string beans cooked in XO sauce.  so damn, good.  I also finished the dinner with 2 cream puffs from Beard Papa's delivered from LA by my cousin, but that's another review.  what a damn meal...service last night was not great at all, but i think its b/c they were so busy, but this place is only known for its yummy food."}
{"text":"Food is okay.  I think they have the most authentic hk food in las vegas. 

I take away two stars because their restaurant is really dirty.  If you look into their tea cups, it's stained.  They can't even clean the insides of the cup!  I wonder why? Same thing is to with the chop sticks.   When you use a white napkin to wipe it, black stuff comes out.  I just wish the managment would find out about this and make those guys that wash the dishes do a better job."}
{"text":"My favorite place for Hong Kong style Chinese food in Las Vegas.  We ordered 3 dishes - a bbq pork noodle in soup, a chili bean curd sauce lettuce and stir fried chicken ho fun rice noodle.   I would say it's better than most of Chinese restaurant in LA."}
{"text":"My wife and I had stopped in for lunch on Sunday afternoon was given a plate of pure fat with two pieces of meat was told this is tendon and is acceptable completely insulting would not refund money obviously did not leave tip. I don't know how it's done in other places but this is obviously unacceptable terrible terrible service we sat right next to the kitchen I looked in the kitchen I should have walked out I think that the health department should be notified disgusting"}
{"text":"I have eaten here several times and this place has never really wowed me. I would have to say that there were some dishes that I liked and for the most part the dishes were just average. Maybe it is because I always stick to my old reliables."}
{"text":"I am a Bay Area native but found the local station news segment which focused this restaurant on Dirty Dining.  The cleanliness could be better but it's mostly attributed to the place needing an update of the furniture and silverware.  They food is decent and the prices are reasonable but there are more places on Spring Mountain Road to explore.  Recently, I was turned off (hence the lower rating) when we had a big group which required us to sit on two separate tables and my cousin paid for both tables and included the tip on the one bill and as we were leaving the waiter kept on saying we didn't tip.  When we finally spoke with the cashier she said agreed with us that the tip was there for both tables."}
{"text":"Went to this place last week with relatives. We had a mixed group of 7 (Chinese & Americans). They had just opened at 11 a.m. and  several of us went to the Men's bathroom to wash our hands only to find the paper towel dispenser was empty!  Like I said they JUST OPENED and they didn't have the bathroom stocked.  That should have been done the night before.  We kind of wonder if the employees even washed hands before they started working & cooking in the morning??  I mentioned to the waitress about the paper towels and it was met with a blank, long-faced stare.  We had to ask for the lunch specials otherwise you get a more expensive menu which seems pretty unethical like they're deliberately trying to rip people off.  My wife asked the waitress if she speaks Mandarin and she RUDELY replied, \"No! Only Cantonese! Speak English!\" (which she wasn't very proficient in either). We ordered 9 dishes for the 7 of us and they gave us one serving bowl of rice that was only enough for 4 people.  After the dishes started coming out, we had to ask for another serving bowl of rice. We liked the fried fish and crispy chicken.  The salt & pepper pork chops weren't very flavorful at all.  We've had better food at the Asian Supermarket's food court and cheaper too!  We were shocked when we got the bill and they charged an additional $5 for the extra bowl of steamed rice! What the heck!!  To make matters worse they automatically added a gratuity of  $11. We didn't see any signs that they add gratuities   for groups of 6 or more so we felt like we were robbed. For the so called SERVICE that we received it wasn't even worth 11 CENTS!  My sister-in-law paid for the bill and decided not to say anything at the time since she was on vacation and didn't want a confrontation. After we walked out the door we all decided that we would NEVER, EVER give this place our business again!"}
{"text":"Always my last resort whenever there are no more restaurants open late night. It can easily be spotted, it's such a big chinese restaurant next to my favorites Tea Station, Sushi Kaya and Ichiza. They serve $5 lunch and late night specials which is always a good deal. Those were the only times i go to. The servings are big enough to fill me up. One of my favorites was the chicken with cream of corn on rice!"}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite places to go. The food is flavorful and the prices are even better. I try to make it at least once a week. I see the bad reviews but the staff are nice when I go. they do their own thing and I dont need them to be nice. I just need my food to taste good and not take long to come. Parking is a big tough to get in but I love eating there and since I been going there I dont eat chinese anywhere else."}
{"text":"The wonton's pretty good -- big and full of meats. We tried some crispy pork stomach that was rather tasteless. The red bean drink (and probably the rest of them too) was not worth it (full of ice.) Otherwise what you would expect from an average Chinese restaurant in the Bay Area."}
{"text":"The restaurant is not fancy looking. Came here with about 25 people. Who took about a third of the restaurant. The food and service was good. I enjoyed eating the beef & broccoli and fried pork chops. I wish the pork chops was boneless."}
{"text":"Always stop by this place whenever I'm in Las Vegas.  Food is great, and a refreshing break from all the buffets."}
{"text":"I have been coming here for a long time. However with time passing, so does this restaurant. When floors looked nice, bathrooms were presentable and smelled decent, and looked clean, for the past 3 years.. my folks love the won-ton mein, but the rest of the restaurant is horrible. I can't stand coming to this restaurant. It was only a few days ago when my mom said \"we aren't coming here anymore.\" I have to make a review of this restaurant. The floors looked like they were going to remodel it, but never got the chance or they'd rather keep the money to themselves. Maybe get paid higher, and avoid the floor costs. The floor has been looking like it was a road in a chinese village since 2 years ago. I remember they were changing ownerships, which could be the reason to be the downfall of this restaurant. The broth for the noodle soup had no taste at all. the floors are blackened, and i had seen a waiter drop the napkins and chopsticks on the dirty, yet blackened floor. You would think he would put them in the dirty bin, yet he blew on the chopsticks wiped them with a cloth and put them back in the drawer. he also fanned out the napkins and put them back as well. OMG i just wanted to puke. What they should do? In my opinion, if it was my restaurant. Get someone to clean the restroom on an hourly basis to refill the amenities. Also downsize the restaurant, so you can afford to get flooring. If not carpet, some cheap tiles. Maybe keep the size of the restaurant and lease half of it to a boba place so then you can finally afford to fix the flooring, and maybe have a decent bathroom. I had to wait til we left and headed to rio, so i could use the restroom. Avoid this at all costs. You rather go and get some mc donalds or pho!"}
{"text":"Man, the duck sucks, rice sucks, ok customer services tho. 
Yuck . I almost had to puke when I get home.
Too much psd as well. Not healthy at all.
All restaurants not healthy food place but we gotta choose relevantly healthier place to eat.
The place in Los Angeles are good. This one so far is bad. Too much oil. Too much grease."}
{"text":"We wanted to have a quick bite before a trip. We were the first customers of the day.    After reading other reviewers' comments, we understand why the restaurant looks so new. Today was the second day of  reopening for business after the renovation.   No wonder the basket of spices and sauces look so clean and new.

We ordered iced water. To our biggest surprise, the waitress brought a jar of iced water for refills. For this, they earned one star! Outside temperature was 107 degrees at 11 am.

We ordered Singapore fried noodles and beef with choi sum over the rice. The portion was good. The beef could be softer but ample sauce over the rice. 

The waitress came and checked on us frequently. She even asked us if the dishes were good.

However we were not sure if the air conditioning unit was not working or they just opened for the day, the inside room temperature was very warm.  So they earned a total of 4 stars."}
{"text":"I love this place. Most likely my favorite Chinese restaurant in Vegas! As I come from California and the Chinese food is just completely different there than here in Vegas (well thats my opinion). I first tried Ping Pang Pong at the Gold Coast hotel and casino for Valentines day and my boy friend and I loved that place but then my co-worker told me about Cafe noodle as Ping Pang Pong is a lot pricier then cafe noodle and she said they have the same owners so their recipes  are the same (I'm not 100% sure how accurate that is but the food was still just as good here) so you get the same for a better price. I like that cafe noodle has a lunch special menu where you get a good portion for a very reasonable price. Everything on the lunch special menu is less than $8. My favorite dishes from here has to be the bbq pork soft noodle (what I consider chow mien) salt and pepper pork chop, beef and broccoli with chinese broccoli, and their chicken in orange sauce. yummmy!!"}
{"text":"This is a hole in the wall type of chinese place on the other side of Chinatown tucked away in a strip mall where parking is a nightmare. Food is good and authentic, service is good most of the time. It's a place you can eat for cheap, but don't expect anything fancy until the owner decides to pork out some money for remodeling. By the way, stay away from the restroom if you can. Hold it until you get back to your hotel."}
{"text":"The redeeming quality of this place is it has cheap chinese food and thats about it.  For $11 per person we ordered 4 dishes for 5 guys and everyone was stuffed.  The service here is typical chinese restaurant so I won't dock them any stars for that.  The food on the other hand needs some help.

The salt and pepper squid had way too much breading on each piece and needed more seasoning.  The ground pork and salty fish strangely had no texture.  I've had this dish many times but this was the first time that it was just extremely mushy, tasted fine.  The BBQ combo, too much to complain about.  The Singapore noodles was by far the best thing and a great filler since the plate was huge.

I don't know where to get good chinese in Vegas but I know its not here."}
{"text":"A very short drive from the north end of the Vegas strip (like Mirage area). Located in a tight plaza with very limited parking, but I'm guessing you can go out back if the front lot is full. Food came out very quickly and service is friendly. We ordered:
-soya chicken (M) which is a half chicken. If I had to compare, the taste of this is slightly better than DC and almost as good as Toronto. Juicy and tastily-flavored while still being very light.
-baby bok choy with garlic. The portion size was quite generous and taste was just right, not overly greasy despite being stir-fried. 
-wonton egg noodle soup with duck. Not a huge portion but was appropriate for the price. The duck was not amazing but I would still say very good, and the broth was light and still salty enough. 
-sweet & sour pork. My dad ordered this at the end out of a whim, and I wasn't thrilled by it, but you'll like it if you're into very sweet marinated meat. Definitely was more sweet than sour.
I was very satisfied with this place offering Hong Kong style dining with light options while not skimping on flavor. The biggest plus about this place is lightning-fast service. You'll have a great time here!"}
{"text":"Worst service.., we had ordered the chow mein and other plates which everything came except the chow mein; we kept telling both servers can you ring up our order for the chow mein, never came. Until everyone was  done with our food he brought it.. All he said was \"I made a mistake\"never going back!"}
{"text":"Had a late night dinner of salt and pepper pork chops, fried sole in soy sauce, pea leaves with garlic and steamed rice. We could not finish the food but everything was delicious! With two sodas to wash it all down, just $30! What a deal!"}
{"text":"The place first showed up on our radar after being tortured terrible Chinese food in the main Chinatown Plaza.  They are just located in a strip mall west them.  The interior is actually above average when compared with other restaurants in the Chinatown area.  Service fits the Asian restaurant stereotype quite well with their poker faces.

They got varies special deals going on at this place, most traditional one is the night snack after 10pm, then there is the afternoon tea specials, and I think they also got something for lunch as well.  The best thing I like about this place is Chinese comfort food.  I never miss a chance to get their flat or egg noodles soups, usually Wonton Beef Stew or Dumpling Noodles.  Stir fried noodles were just as good.

Congee and BBQ were decent as well.  Rice plates were another thing I get every now and then, notably Curry Beef Stew Rice and Minced Beef with Egg Rice.  For regular dishes, I was not such big fan about them.  They prepared them decent enough compared to ones I had in my home state.  The cod dish seems to be pretty good deal at night snack hours.  They have off menu items such as oysters upon request.

In Cantonese, their name is pronounced \"Luk Ding Gei\", which had nothing to do with Cafe Noodle and Chinese Barbeque.  Since most of the places suck in the Chinatown Plaza, this place is the closest place being decent near that area."}
{"text":"Coming from LA, where there is a very large chinatown area, it's sometimes hard to find authentic Chinese food. Cafe Noodle is a great place to go if close authenticity, without the high price tag, is important to you. They offer a fairly large array of items (including the ones that would probably steer you clear of inviting a friend that is not familiar with authentic Chinese food).

You are greeted by a happy buddha, that stands on top of the counter. 

Most tables are round that can seat 6-9 people. There are also booth tables available as well. I usually prefer sitting away from the roasting area, since the smell of duck can get overwhelming and possibly change your palette and appetite. 

The menu is extensive and has standard Chinese fare plus many authentic dishes. The sesame chicken is great. I always order the honey shrimp. Be forewarned though, that Cafe Noodle's honey shrimp might have more of the sweet mayo than usual. But the shrimps are large, which I like. Also, their duck is fantastic, as well as their fried bass. Also, try their pan fried seafood chow mein. I love my noodles extra crispy, and they make it just right. It is amazing. 

Service is up to par. I would actually say better than majority of \"mom/pop\" chinese establishments that I have been at. A good amount of the workers there understand and speak english well. 

Parking can be difficult, so dont be in too much of a hurry if you plan on eating there."}
{"text":"My cousins and I always choose this restaurant when we want to get together and have Chinese. We're a group of 30 year old Filipinos and are really picky when it comes to good Asian cuisine.  We also live in the Silverado Ranch area, so obviously we're not looking for just a convenient Chinese restaurant when we come here. The staff is quick to serve you.  It's great for late night after party meals.  I always order half a duck, Honey Walnut prawns, HK fried noodle combo and some type of beef dish. By the time we roll out of there we are completely satisfied. 

If you're looking for someplace to go either right before you hit the strip or after a late night of partying  this place is perfect. I brought 12 guys celebrating a bachelor party. We were in there at 9 and out by 10! The food only took 15 min. to start coming out. By the time we were done, the guys were complaining that they were too full to drink. Let's just say, no one passed out drunk that night."}
{"text":"Eh. This place is ok. The restaurant is a bit dirty. 2 of 3 tea cups for our table were dirty. Anyway, we ordered:

Chinese Sausage with Vegetables: There's more vegetables than chinese sausage. I thought this was an ok dish. 

Pig feet with Lettuce: The pig feet wasn't that tender and it in a bean curd sauce. I didn't care much for the sauce. I thought this was the worst dish out of all of them.

Fried Tofu: This dish was pretty good. The fried part of the tofu wasn't thick and the sauce that came with it was pretty good.

Salted Duck Egg with Pork Soup: The soup was good. I like that they had a couple pieces of the salted egg in it. This was probably my favorite dish.

The service was ok. Not a lot of people were here so everything went smoothly.

The restaurant is large. It's enough for a large group. 

Overall, dirty place with ok food."}
{"text":"Well this place is great, if you can over look the poor decor. As I only go here for lunch I can tell you that the lunch specials are amazing! $5 for a great meal. If you go here from 3pm-5pm your meal comes with an amazing Hong Kong milk tea. Personal favorites for here are the orange chicken and the chicken with black bean sauce both amazing to eat, of course you get rice with anything you order. Because the portions are large eating family style is great with friends, since we should all remember sharing is caring :-)"}
{"text":"For the portion size it's a great place to go. I get fried rice all the time and they serve you enough for like 3 people! But the staff can be quite rude sometimes or not very welcoming. If you have the chance then I would recommend going during their lunch special hours."}
{"text":"Came here for lunch & ordered from their lunch special menu. Items range from $4.95-7.95. We ordered the Singapore fried vermicelli noodles and sweet and sour chicken. Both items were pretty decent. We actually ended up taking some home so portions were right size as well.

Interior is usual Chinese restaurant decor. Servers here.. well if you frequent Chinatown often you already know the typical service they give at Chinese restaurants. This is no different.

I'd come back just for the lunch specials and look forward to trying other items :)"}
{"text":"We came here with a party of 14 for dinner, and we end up sitting at 2 round tables side by side. The service was OK, the food was not bad. We had the lobster special for $7 per lb which they always charge 1 lb or 2 more than actually weight (very typical pratice in restaurants that offers lobster/crab specials).  

We usually come here for lunch, it's a place we would go if we are close by or if it's convenient for us. It's not a place to make a special trip."}
{"text":"I have been here once, their service aren't that good, and not that friendly. The most upset me thing was they took tips automatically, and more than 15%."}
{"text":"It's been a few years since I banned this place after experiencing hostile service and later found out that they fraudulently charged my credit card for an underserving tip!

I wanted to give them another chance. 
As soon as I was seated with my husband and 7wk old baby, I wanted to wipe Lysol all over the table and seats. The place is very run down. I don't think they have done any upkeep since ninteen-forgotten. 

The servers were surprisingly friendly. We ordered the oxtail hot pot which was served warm in a steel bowl and the fried salted prune pork ribs which looked more appetizing than it tasted. We barely ate half of what we ordered.

To cleanse my tortured palette, I took a gulp of my hubby's Coke. Everyone knows I don't drink soda...   

Forgive and forget? Not!"}
{"text":"Good Chinese at reasonable prices.. they even have a late night menu.. only problem is the bad service!!"}
{"text":"When I lived here, this was our Chinese restaurant of choice, and this sentiment extends to this day.

Our \"regulars\" are the House Pan-fried Noodles, XO Beans, and the Walnut Shrimp. But on our last trip, a new discovery was made; the Salt and Pepper Pork Chops. It is to die for. In Hawaii, there is a place called \"Little Village\" who has a killer S&P Pork Chop, but, alas, it is no match for this one. If I wasn't so full from all the other delectable offerings, I'd have inhaled the last two pieces!

Good prices, portions, friendly staff, clean and modern atmosphere. But ultimately, great tasting food is why CN&CB is my choice when Chinese is craved.

PS, I can never remember the name....Is it really that complex???"}
{"text":"Great place for some chinese food in Las Vegas.  Better than Sam Woo down the street.  

Didn't see much BBQ items though when I came in on a Monday around lunch time."}
{"text":"Amazing ox tail stew, this alone made my day. Great variety, comfort Chinese food, good portions, acceptable service, it's my new favorite budget go-to Chinese restaurant."}
{"text":"When me and my friends come here we are always seated right away. We always get the pork chops! The prices were decent and the portions are ok."}
{"text":"I must say, this is definitely not on my \"favorite, oh my gosh I love this place\" Chinese joints. I love the price of the stuff here, and I always end up finding myself here to feed a big group of people, or to fix a really really late night craving for Chinese food. 

Service is generally really fast, but the food is normally on the salty side, like \"oh my gosh I can totally taste the MSG\" and I normally get a headache after eating here and I think it's from the seasoning, or just the MSG they add to the meals. The place isn't super clean, but it's not disgusting dirty. I do like the taste of their hot tea here that they serve. 
 
Food is nicely portioned, so like I said, I definitely like the price of everything here especially because they have the \"special price/portioned\" menu. It's easy to feed a party of 10+ more people and end up only paying $10-$15 each if you split the bill'' and you'll have order a shit load of food, like over 6 or 7 dishes. This is a good place to come and eat if you're hungry and you wanna split the bill so you can try everything that's ordered.

They normally do a good job at accommodating very large groups. Bathroom isn't all that clean, so I would suggest hold it if you can. 

Oh and parking is a total bitch in the plaza where this restaurant is located so know you have been warned. When the parking lot is full (which it normally is always full) you have to park in the Chinatown parking lot next to this plaza."}
{"text":"I was looking at a fancy menu then I noticed the other one.  Low low prices for the amount of food you get.  I tried the chicken with orange peel and was simply blown away.  Best orange chicken ever!  The orange sauce was red.  It was soooo good.  I would recommend it to anyone."}
{"text":"What the restaurant is CLEAN.But it is in dirty dinning now?Check on ktnv.Have not been there over a month.but it is not hear bussiness good."}
{"text":"This Chinese restaurant is located a few minutes from the strip and is a good alternative to the many buffets in town. The food here is very tasty, satisfying yet affordable for people on a budget. The servings are big enough to share as well so its perfect for families. The servers are very friendly and provide good fast service. The restaurant is nothing fancy but it is clean, spacious and open late. Parking is easy here too as there are parking areas in the front and back of the building."}
{"text":"We got seated and was served water, it tasted like some kind of chemical taste. Bathroom was a mess with all their cleaning supplies all over the ground. They weren't busy at all maybe like our group of 4 and 1 other group. When our group was ready to order, they didnt have a few items available. When our food arrived nothing seemed fresh. . . . We ordered 3 types of fried rice (lup chung, seafood, and dried scallops), they all looked the same and just very boring with all the same taste to it, nothing too fancy but a cabbage and some green onions and an egg. We also ordered the bbq park (dry, and not soaked long enough).  We also got their brisket with won ton soup with egg noodles (noodles wasnt freshed at all, it had a very old fishy smell, the won ton seemed like it was previously frozen which is normal but it tasted like it was kept in the freezer for quite too long). I dont want to be one to say not to try it because everyone's experience is different. . . . But i definitely wont try it again!"}
{"text":"We had a superb lunch of Jellyfish/cold sliced pork hock, baby bok choy and pig feet casserole. No crowds (but it was Monday). Service was good and HK coffee was better. A good value for Vegas."}
{"text":"Great food and service congee was awesome  and you can't beat the 5.95 whole crispy chicken lunch special"}
{"text":"Filthy Chinese place. Wonton soup has sand in it. Asked for another one and still has sand in it. Yuck! Looks like they do not wash their ingredients here. Do not come here unless you want to get sick."}
{"text":"After watching the yawn-inducing KA by Cirque Du Soleil, my parents was hungry so we decided to come here for a late night meal. We only ordered three dishes since it was late and we didn't really want a heavy tummy before bed but the food we ordered was pretty good. 

So we shared the shredded pork porridge and two ordered of the beef tendon wonton noodle soup. The noodles were really fresh but there was only 3 wontons...it's three pretty big ones though. the beef tendon was okay. 

Overall the food was okay and the place is pretty clean and spacious."}
{"text":"The one of best restaurant in las vegas.  The restaurant very clean . specially the rest room look  clean . i check the rest room first before i sit down to eat.
Also they have delious foods. You need try Peking Duck. The best peking duck i had."}
{"text":"Huge disappointment! My family and I used to come here all the time before I left for college (so it's been about 6 years since I've been). We ordered the stuff that we'd usually get: salt and pepper pork chops, combination pan fried noodles, and jellyfish with century egg. 

There was no fresh garlic in the pork chops, and the jalapeño was raw as if the cook remembered at the last minute to actually throw in some pepper with the salt and pepper pork chops. We also ordered salt and pepper calamari, and they were treated the same. Both were inconsistently fried, so some bites were a bit mushy. When we told our server what we thought of the dishes, she apologized that the cook must have forgotten to add salt and offered to bring us a salt shaker. I ordered the calamari, because the server said it would have tentacles. Nope, it was just thick cuts of squid...

The jellyfish was hardly marinated or pickled. It was just drenched in chili oil. It was also missing the pickled radish at the bottom. The pan fried noodles were okay. It didn't have any exciting flavors, and there wasn't as much seafood as they used to serve. 

We also ordered a pork and century egg congee. It needed a lot of red vinegar and soy sauce for it to have any flavor and there were big chunks of ginger that were unpleasant to chew on.

Our server apologized and said that a lot of customers have been unhappy with the quality of food. The renovations that have happened since I last ate here show that the new management is trying to increase the quality of this restaurant, but they really need to work on the quality of their food. It no longer tastes authentic and I don't see myself returning."}
{"text":"when we first moved to vegas, we would frequent cafe noodle, especially late at night when craving chinese food.

the food was always just decent, not great, not bad.
service was always typically cantonese, not great, not bad.

then...
saw them on dirty dining.
will never eat here again..."}
{"text":"This has become my go to chinese place for a cheap lunch or some take out chinese food in Vegas. They have an extensive list of lunch specials for $4.95 that you can choose from including, beef & egg on rice, beef chow fun, salt & pepper pork chops, and more. I think the special prices are also late night, so if you are craving some good cheap chinese food, come here. I've also tried some of their other food off their menu including the wonton noodle soup and their bbq items, although the bbq items were a bit more expensive."}
{"text":"When I first started coming here it was good. The service on the other hand could of been better. Their dinner here is always good no matter what. All the food on their menu is always cooked perfectly. They even have a lunch special menu if you come within the lunch hours. My boyfriend and I used to come here at least once a week or once every 2 weeks. 

Coming from a family where my mom works in the food and beverage industry, she has always taught me to ALWAYS give tip no matter how bad the service is or how horrible the food is. Just put down a dollar at least. My boyfriend also having his dad in the same industry he taught him the same exact thing..

When the waiters/waitresses gives us the check we pay the bill first and then place down the tip on the table before we leave the restaurant. I guess one of the waitress recognizes us and one day comes to us while handing us the receipt she has the nerve to tell us that we don't tip or that her other co-workers tells her that we don't like to tip. 
So when she gives us the bill she asks us 
\"Do you guys not like to tip because the service is bad?\" 
And then we answered
\"No, we always tip. Even if the service was bad we tip.\"

Then after that little conversation we had, she backed off and didn't say a word. When we were about to leave I told my boyfriend to only leave a dollar on the damn table. They didn't deserve any more than a dollar because they had the damn nerve to talk to us about tips. 

So since then, we've never been back and never will. This place is good for the lunch specials but the company isn't gonna get our money no more."}
{"text":"If you want to eat well, you HAVE to order their congee.  No question about it. It's my favoriate item here hands down. Beef, fish, thousand-year-old egg... all the traditional combinations are available to fill your Cantonese cravings.  Served pippin' hot you'll appreciate the flavorful entree even more-so. 

Tea Time Special
If you order on their menu between 3pm-5pm on a weekday they will give you a complimentary coffee or milk tea drink. Sweet!"}
{"text":"i went here quite often. Most of their food is good. The pork chop is awesome, wonton n suei kiaw soup is wonderful. Beef flat rice noodle is delicious, salt pepper squid is good too. I usually happy w/ their food. Service is so so, depends who ur server is.
Beware!! Their chix wing!! They serve it to me is medium, still bloody!! Gross!!"}
{"text":"Our favorate noodle place closed down for good (noodle palace). Very glad we found this place. Food is good and comes very quick. Edited on 12/18/13. We stopped coming here because of the roaches that were crawling on the walls and because of a server who didn't wash their hands after using the restroom. Absolutely disgusting."}
{"text":"After waiting about 20 minutes for water/ hot tea after we were seated, this restaurant was already unimpressive. 

Food was substandard and nothing really stood out. We had charsiu, beef broccoli, house fried noodles, house fried rice, and cold ginger chicken. The chicken was unappetizing and flavorless, and I think even Pandas (which is not real Chinese food) would have done these dishes better.

An automatic 15% gratuity was added to our bill because we had 6 people, but for the lack of service we got I really wish they hadn't tacked that on. 

So disappointing. We'll venture elsewhere for Chinese cuisine in the future."}
{"text":"Meh.  I've had much better in Boise.  My Singapore style noodles were bland.  The barbecued pork was fatty.  My wife's Mongolian beef was very tasty, but again the beef had too much fat.  And while the decor is nice, the cleanliness could be improved - the condiment tray at our table looked like it hadn't been cleaned in at least a week (an probably much longer).  We'll likely try a different Chinese place next time."}
{"text":"Food was delicious at a very good price, I was actually able to try alot of good items on the menu service was also very good I'm definitely coming back soon"}
{"text":"My husband and I stopped by for lunch after our plane landed in Las Vegas. Since we came in from the east coast, our internal clock is still ahead and when we arrived, we were very hungry as it was way past our lunch time and the places that we tried to go prior to this one had yet to open. 

We both ordered dumpling and egg noodle soup. I thought it was very tasty. They gave us plenty of dumplings and I like the baby bok choi that they put in the soup. The price here is very cheap - $5.95 for a bowl. You can't beat that!"}
{"text":"Good price Chinese restaurant .. it's my 3rd times visit when I come vegas .. I like it anyway."}
{"text":"Food was great!!! Portions were humongous!!! Service could be better. Cleanliness, hmm sure? Overall nice experience. Not much to complain about. I recommend my friends to go here. I'd say: authentic."}
{"text":"Been here quite a few times... Always return for their salmon heads in black bean sauce, crispy pork intestines... It's very affordable and I like the food... Mostly for down to earth folk... If you're into fancy stuff, this place isn't for you..."}
{"text":"After a night of looking for something new to try, I decided on Cafe Noodle.  We ordered the Chicken and Broccoli, Mongolian Beef, Chicken and Crispy Noodles and Steamed Garlic Eggplant.  All the items we ordered to try are on the special $5 late night menu.  While I am a fan of the Mongolian Beef and the Steamed Garlic Eggplant, the chicken in both of the other dishes appeared to be a little (unfortunately) undercooked.  I'm not sure that this is how those dishes are always served but I'm willing to go back to try again.

There are a bunch of things on the lunch/late night special menu and when you think about the portion size, you're getting a great deal.  An earlier review made mention of the taste of Vegas Tap Water being a predominant flavor in the tea.  I'd have to agree.  Quite unfortunate.

I'll go back and try other things (probably staying away from the chicken) and get a Diet coke or something instead of drinking the hot tea that tastes of Vegas."}
{"text":"A three hour walking exploration of Las Vegas' Chinatown culminated with a large and delicious lunch here.  Relying once again on the ratings of Las Vegas Yelpers I decided to check out this spacious restaurant along Spring Mountain Road.

It was like stepping into a restaurant back home again as a lady greeted me in Cantonese and asked me how many.  A single index finger answered that question as I was escorted to my table.  Judging by their conversation two gentlemen seated beside me on their lunch break seemed to really like this place.  Honestly I don't eavesdrop but sometimes when you're sitting there reading your cell phone you hear things.

The menu being clumsy and tattered was definitely a symbol as to the popularity of the place.  The prices on the other hand were about double what I would pay in San Francisco, but I usually keep an open mind on that being that things are rarely as good as they are at home.

Noodles or Chinese barbecue?  Not having steamed rice for nearly a week the Chinese in me went with the latter in selecting the rice plate with two BBQ meats.  Roast Duck was definitely going to be my first choice, but it was the recent review of a San Francisco Yelp friend who wrote about a San Francisco deli with very good Soy Sauce Chicken that influenced me into trying my second choice.  I hadn't had soy sauce chicken all year so that's what I picked to go beside my duck.

Not sure about portion size I selected the Crispy Fried Tofu appetizer as well.

The tofu (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/L6qd3x0bHymyxub9dF7lIA?select=2qOeThevkuoRKc9Enk6mSQ) arrived first.  The eight squares of crispy, golden fried silken tofu on a bed of shredded lettuce served with a simple soy sauce infused with chopped, fresh jalapeno was simple and fabulous.  The taste was very clean and very fresh without a hint of frying oil.

When I saw my rice plate (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/L6qd3x0bHymyxub9dF7lIA?select=8UiNNR3cVaxzUVHi3UoCDw) I knew right away I couldn't finish it.  Not only was the steamed rice piled high, but so were the meats.  I knew I'd end up concentrating on the meat since I wasn't about to carry leftovers back to my hotel room.  The drippings from the roast duck mixed into the rice was so good though it was hard not to eat all the rice.  Both of the meats were cooked well.  The chicken had good flavor but the meat was a bit thin and a bit chewy.  The duck was actually meatier than the chicken, and I definitely enjoyed the flavor more.

My sensitivity to MSG didn't come into play.  It's hard to imagine Chinese style BBQ without MSG, but since I couldn't detect any I'd have to say this place did it right.  The health score of \"A\" was quite reassuring too.  That's something I don't see that often in San Francisco!"}
{"text":"Near the strip offers special lunch and late night special not bad.  Good service, clean."}
{"text":"Can't really compare to Los Angeles. But this is a good place for HK/Cantonese food. They open early and close late at night. After a good Chinese concert, you can always come here for late night snacks. 

Service is above average. Price is a bit pricey compare to Los Angeles, but reasonable and cheaper than San Diego. 

Food quality is hell better than Sam Woo next door. I still remember I got sick from Sam Woo, too much oil! 

Fried Garlic Veal was good. Mayonnaise Rock cod was tender. Wonton was ok, still can't compare to Hong Kong's. The noodle however is better than any places I've tried. Instead of soft and soggy, it actually taste like those in HK.  I'm only talking about the noodle itself. The soup base for the noodle is decent.

The BBQ pork (char siu) and chicken is decent also. I prefer fatty char siu... the tastiest part of the char siu =P"}
{"text":"I had an orange smoothies without whipped cream that was a great treat. We ordered the crispy chicken special and were surprised that we got so much for under six dollars. Some in my group said that the pot stickers were too dry but I had no problems devouring them."}
{"text":"Late dinner on Thursday, 8/6/15 (first time visiting)

Las Vegas and late night eating is wonderful! We drive to Chinatown for some Chinese food. There's no wait in line and plenty of parking. The servers seated us immediately and gave us menus. 

We ordered the wonton noodle soup, hot and sour soup, beef and Chinese broccoli, and a dish with chopped up Chinese sausages, green beans, and dried tofu. It's not the best Chinese food out there to have but pretty good for a quick late night meal. 

They have a separate drink selection too. I wasn't hungry enough to order more so I'll be back to try those items."}
{"text":"The people here were pretty nice the establishment was clean. And the food was just ok. I can't say much more other then that for this location."}
{"text":"I didn't feel like paying huge $ for hotel foods while in Vegas.
I came here for my Chinese fix.  I randomly picked this place while driving thru Vegas Chinatown but I was not disappointed.

Food price is on par for what I pay in L.A.
But portion is much larger!  Wow, I ended up ordering more food than I can eat.

Taste is just on the average to above average side but this place
is huge, clean, and must be authentic because they had no problem getting steady flow of customers.  Vast majority of customers appear to be Chinese.  Service is outstanding, staff are friendly and food was served quickly."}
{"text":"A friend and I took our children to lunch. Definitely a locals place
We always like to experience different things so we order a variety of food. 
Unfortunately they stil ordered items that sounded familiar. 
We ordered the Chicken with Orange Peel -  The chicken pieces were heavily coated in batter and then drenched in a very sweet sauce. 
The ramen soup with shrimp dumplings was very good. 
We also had the BBQ pork with soft noodle, very tasty in which nothing was left 
The combination fried rice was also good. 
The service was great! The prices were good, the atmosphere was below average. Things appeared a bit worn and needed to be clean."}
{"text":"I love this place.. Food is great!!! For $20 for 2 person is not bad at all and we also have left overs that we can eat the next day. The salt and pepper pork chop is highly recommended it only $4.50 with free rice. Theres a lot of good food here.."}
{"text":"Went to Cafe Noodle over the weekend and I was disappointed with some of my dishes.  I was craving roast duck and char siu and found both to be less than stellar.  The pieces I got were too fatty and were lacking in flavor.  One highlight was the wat dan har fan (shrimp and scrambled eggs on rice).  This great comfort food dish had a light sauce and large, plump shrimp."}
{"text":"In a rush but don't want to go to a fast food restaurant? Budget is tight? Then this is the place! Price to beat! Food is tasty and portions are large. Quick service and friendly staff. We come here mostly after midnight because the place can be packed during the day. The place could use some major renovations, though. But overall, I like it!"}
{"text":"tasty food, fair price, but not to clean! Descent service.
Their live lobster with ginger and scallions is to die for!"}
{"text":"I've been here a few times now and every time it has hit the spot. They are open late, have cheap prices during their happy hour and the food is authentic!

Usually i'll order a Salted Fish and Chicken Fried Rice if its to go or when sitting down, get one of their many noodle soups. Salt n Pepper anything is great and they do it quite well here.  Just a short quick drive down Spring Mtn from the strip, I always make the trip here when I need a pick me up after a night of drinking."}
{"text":"This place is so sad. So my family decided to order 4 dishes. And the waitress was very rude. She kept on rushing my mom when ordering. My mom got mad and ask her, \"why are you rushing me to order?\" (She just wanted to help another table first) So the waitress goes back into the kitchen with our order. Two of our dishes come out with the rice so my family and I started to eat. We sat there for like 20 - 25 mins for our remaining 2 dishes but it never came. So we ask the waiter what happened to our dishes. Apparently, the lady waitress who took our order at the beginning didn't put it in. My family and I were just sitting there for almost 30 mins and it wasn't put in. Being already mad at the service from the start, I told the waiter to just cancel the 2 remaining dishes and bring me my check. Instead of listening to me, they bring the 2 dishes out and try to shove it onto our table. I've already (repeatedly) told them to cancel the order and bring me my check but yet, they still did that?? It's like a bad joke that has turned into a nightmare. By this point, my family is already beyond mad and it's Christmas Day so that wasn't a great lunch for us. I hate being mean, but I was already mad so I told the waiter (in a mean Chinese voice), \"I don't want it, I want my check.\" I got the check (finally) and went to the cashier to pay. The lady there didn't even acknowledge me until I told her if this is where I pay the bill. Gave $0 tip. And left. Horrible place! I will remember this and not come back here forever. 

PS, this place was closed for a while because they DID NOT pass health inspection. That should tell u how dirty this place is."}
{"text":"Been going here for years.. all these reviews I been reading are so untrue.. they're service is amazing,  like I've said my family and I have been coming here for years, everytime we step in the friendly staff greets us right away and already knows my drink order, the waiting time for the food isn't long but depending  when you go, I mean it's common sense if it's lunch time be expected to wait a little longer, but it's worth the wait!! The food reminds me of home cooked meal!! Prices are unbeatable, for something fast and simple.. I read reviews that food is cheap well don't be expecting to pay $4.95 for a sirloin steak! Let's be reasonable! ! The saying goes.. you pay for what you get!! Overall I love this place, better then PANDA EXPRESS!! At least I know it's true chinese when you see chinese people actually cooking it!!XD"}
{"text":"Extremely disappointed with the service here. I went here with my dad and we ordered beef pan fried noodle, an order of fried chicken, and fried fish. Once we ordered another party came in and ordered the fried chicken as well and so the server responded back saying our table ordered first but the manager stated that the other table ordered first. Doesn't make sense how a party that came in 5 minutes after us gets our order first. The servers were nice but the management is very lackluster and rather than the manager being a leader, they are a boss giving commands. Aside from that the food is decent but not worth the price as the portions are pretty small. With portion sizes like this and terrible management I wouldn't ever come back here."}
{"text":"Pretty fast & good foods... Clean & bright dinning room, pretty good service, only $4.95/dish great deal. Recommended to try"}
{"text":"3.5 stars is appropriate for now. I got the bbq and rice combo. The duck was great. The chicken was too bony. The veggies were a nice surprise. The watermelon juice is exactly that. The juice was good but nothing to rave about. This place will likely shine when experienced with a group of sharers. Looking forward to trying the bbq pork, the fish, and the fried rice in the future."}
{"text":"No more cheap prizes and quality of food really went way down. Still the same rude servers. They used to have $5.95, $6.95 and 7.95 dishes then they half the potions now it's a thing of the past. For their expensive price it is not worth it. Of course they are regulars of Dirty Dining so beware. Eat some place else."}
{"text":"This specials' price is higher than pictures in their profile on yelp
Cheapest is now $6. Still reasonable. and comes w milk tea for dine in. Food is just your typical HK style restaurant. not the cleanest but for the prices it is a OK."}
{"text":"Air Conditioner not working well. it was uncomfortable to eat. they were busy but it was disappointing to get food 1-2 dishes at a time for a party of 10...very slow. food is ok"}
{"text":"3.5 stars. Decent and cheap food. Rice plates and noodles are $5 and up. Servers are nice and I'd go here over restaurants at the Strip. You can feed a whole family for what you'd pay for a buffet for 2. Oh, and you get free dessert after you finish your dinner."}
{"text":"This Chinatown restaurant is well-located, easily seen from the street, and right next to my favorite tea house and Vietnamese food-to-go place.  However, I never felt the inspiration to stop by; last night a girlfriend was raving about the egg noodles, and so we ate here today for Sunday lunch.

The interior is definitely not as hopeful-looking as the exterior.  The service is pretty sporadic, you definitely have to make an effort to get the attention of the servers if you need something.

My friend was right about the noodles.  They were as fresh as egg noodles go and perfectly cooked (egg noodles are usually overcooked in most places).  I ordered the BBQ duck and pork & shrimp wonton noodle soup.  The wontons were a good size and very delicious.  The BBQ duck was all right, a little on the bland side.  The noodles certainly were the highlight.

I also judge Chinese restaurants by their complimentary tea pot, I believe it gives me a sneak peek of how much effort they put into their food.  Cafe Noodle's tea was made with tap water, I could taste the Vegas pipes, which means points have to be deducted.  

So if you crave egg noodle soup, stop by, but try to order everything you need all at once, and get a soda or bottled water for your refreshment."}
{"text":"Typical Chinese-bland service but prompt... I had great Wor won ton soup with large home made dumplings with tasty eggs noodles. My wife had the BBQ duck soup and would't even talk to me while eating (good sign)."}
{"text":"I dunno who said this place is cheap and why it only has $ because that is totally false. I came here because of the reviews and almost walked out. Almost all the dishes are at least $12. Not only that but after ordering the food the middle aged waiter with glasses just tossed my food on the table. Did not ask who the food was for thanked us. Even paying the bill there was a lack of customer appreciation. The food was very mediocre at best, really not worth checking out. Really the worst factor was the rude and disrespectful service."}
{"text":"After hearing about the roasted chicken several times from my boyfriend's dad, I finally got to try it!! 

Oh man, those late night specials are deep trouble! $5 for a variety of different chinese and noodle dishes. I'd probably just go here for the late night specials just because I don't think I can pay full price knowing that I could wait a couple of hours to save a few bucks. Yes, I'm frugal.

The chicken curry was okay. Not really what I'm use to since I love indian and thai curry so much. If you're thinking of those kinds of curry when you order this dish, please remind yourself... it is NOWHERE near that. 

The salt/pepper porkchop: crispy and delicious!

The roasted chicken had a nice crispy skin to it and they give you the whole chicken cut up into pieces. Woop Woop.

The service was good... but I think it's mostly because I went with my boyfriend's dad and he goes there quite often. :o) But they made sure to keep us happy!"}
{"text":"I have only ever had the wonton soup here.  I order it without noodles and it is some of the best I've had.  I love the slightly sweet, aromatic broth and the dumplings are very good.  I've heard the other food is just so-so and I haven't tried it.  But I am a repeat customer for their wonton soup.  

Check out the Crown Bakery upstairs from this place - it's great."}
{"text":"During our 4 day trip, we stopped here 3 times. The food was good quality, and even better if you could get the special prices."}
{"text":"Nice little gem off the strip for amazing Chinese food. Never mind the dirty old walls and old dim lighting. The food tastes and costs amazing!

I came here to eat with my good friends and ordered wonton noodle soup, beef and broccoli, and a few other dishes I have no idea how to identify in English. Seasoning was just right for my taste--not too salty, not too bland. When you're in Las Vegas the heat dries you up already. No need to dehydrate further with excessive salt intake. Bill for 7 of us came out to about $60 which is unfathomable considering the distance from the strip.

We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"I was recommended this place and very much liked my first experience here. The service was courteous and the food was delicious. Portions are a good size for the price. I would definitely return and recommend to anyone."}
{"text":"Love the food here but despise the staff. Never friendly, no smiles, no refills, and they give dirty looks. I usually go here after basketball at tark. I enjoy their whole chicken, pan fried noodles, whole sole fish and fried shrimp. They have a discounted menu after 11pm as well. If it wasn't for the tasty food I wouldn't give them my business."}
{"text":"We waited for a very long time after we put the order. Nothing was served. It was not a busy hour at all. They forgot our order. Funny."}
{"text":"1) Generous portion great for big party. 
2) Price is good for Vegas.
3) Not much of a wait for lunch and dinner
4) Service is good from the waitresses that's if you don't get the owner helping you, she is very mean. 
5) Tables are sticky so make sure you wipe down before setting your arms on top of it."}
{"text":"If you are a fan of Chinese style noodles and pork... this is your place! 

This place is located in a strip mall, downstairs from my favorite place in 
Las Vegas, Ichiza. The parking lot wraps around behind the building and should be plentiful even when busy. 

I ordered wonton and beef noodles, fried tofu, Singapore style noodles (curry flavored), BBQ combination (2 items - chicken and pork... should have tested the duck out... I get sick of cutting myself up on bone fragments), rice and hot tea. The bill with tax and tip (I gave 'em a decent tip) was $43. Awesome. The food was plenty and of excellent caliber. No ABC here.  I think the 2 item BBQ combo for $12 is the best deal!

The service was brisk and attentive.  Unlike a lot Chinese places, they are happy to have customers and will help you out if you have ordering if you have any questions.

Did I mention how good the wonton and beef noodles were?!  Love the soup part; excellent use of stock.  Loved the noodles!"}
{"text":"People might be really curious about going back here after of so many times they failed the health inspection, but this time i can see for sure that they've changed their ways a lot. From the kitchen being visible to the public, and whole place was renovated except for the restroom, even the service was changed too! I love how the food was so tasty yet so cheap. This is the only place i go to whenever i feel like eating Chinese food in a very reasonable price. Servers became a little bit nicer now compare before haha. They do close early now at 12:00 MIDNIGHT, and they have the tip percentage on the receipt as well compare before. All in all, it changed for the BETTER, and i'm so happy since I LOVE THIS PLACE!"}
{"text":"Great prices and great specials $4.95 beef with prayer sauce was very good and good sized portion. $4.95 mandarin pork was good as well again good sized portion. Both dishes could of easily been a filling meal but for that price me and the gf figured the portion has to be small we better order another dish.

 She got the shrimp and pork wonton soup which was ok not the greatest. They didn't skip on the wontons like some places do it probably had 5 or 6 good sized ones. It also had rice noodles and bok choy mixed in. I order the $5.95 bbq pork and noodles which was ehh not to favorable. You can tell them to make the noodles spicier if desired. We only finished one dish between the two of us and took the rest home.

The service was pretty good not the greatest but better then most places. Not the type of place to take Someone you're trying to impress but great for a quick bite. Complimentary tea was a plus and the food arrived very fast. Me and the gf were very impressed as we weren't expecting much from this place we were just looking for a late night meal after work. We will prob be regulars here in the future."}
{"text":"They had the lunch specials again after a hiatus during the holiday season. But even the cheap price of $4.95 couldn't help to make this dining experience more enjoyable. What happened!!!  I used to think highly of this place and their food.  This time though, I was not impressed when I told them that their congee has a slightly sour taste (I think it was going bad) and was told that they had it that morning and it was fine. Instead apologizing for serving the bad congee, they denied that anything was wrong with it. That in itself is a big no no in my books. What happened to the customer satisfaction. OH, I forgot we are in a Chinese restaurant. Besides this, the portions have gotten significantly smaller than before Xmas. Also, the waiter came over to ask if we were done, when two of us still had chopsticks in our hand and still eating. 0 stars for customer service and food, but I will give them 1 star for their speediness in bringing out the dishes to us soon after we ordered it. There was hardly anyone in the restaurant. Is this because they don't know that the lunch special prices have returned or the portions are now smaller? Whatever the case may be, I will be joining the crowd and going elsewhere to dine for lunch."}
{"text":"We were driving around Chinatown looking for a great place to get some food and not spend too much money. Café noodle satisfied our craving for late-night Chinese food."}
{"text":"Walked in after not being able to go to another restaurant. Was nice surprise because expected food not to be good.  It was good authentic Chinese food.   It wasn't the best Chinese food I've had,  but the service was better than most Chinese restaurants."}
{"text":"Bulk self serve family style restaurant. The servings are very large and they set them in the middle of the table for the entire family to share. Not to pricey. Finally I got to eat Chinese food in Las Vegas without swelling up. Must mean there is NO MSG!!! We oredered the Salt N' Pepper Pork Chops they were EXCELLENT we also ordered House Chow Fun.....The seafood in it was a suprise, I was not expecting that. We also ordered the Tofu and Veggies. This was also good. The food came out in a timely manor and I never had to ask for a refill on my drink. Total cost $27.00 fantastic price for 3 people and we took home left overs!"}
{"text":"Such dirty business doesn't deserve to be here in Vegas, or even be on earth at all, watch this video on how they got shut down.  Moldy mushroom, moldy tofu, dirty kitchen working surface, and all kind of bad stuff going into people's stomach.

{"text":"I have had a Chinese food craving so I have been going for the lunch specials about twice a week.  I decided that I am going to go up and down Spring Mountain to check out all of the Chinese food places.

My first stop was Cafe Noodle, I didn't hear anything about this place until I walked through the door.  I went in originally to get some good noodles, but their noodle dishes seemed standard for a Chinese restaurant so I decided to do the lunch special.

I ordered the Kung Pao squid, above everything else it was FRESH.  It tasted like they prepared it while I was waiting.  The special comes with some rice, a spring roll and a won ton.  The rice, spring roll and won ton were more then less forgettable.  For 6 bucks though the deal was good and the food filling.  If you eat there I believe you get soup and tea.

I have been there twice since the first time and judging on the quality of food I will be back again."}
{"text":"Although I love their salt and pepper pork chops that are only 4.50, I'm still wondering how they even passed their health inspection. As soon as I walked in the first thing I noticed were the black tiles that were obviously a tan color in some other lifetime. If they can't even mop their floors once in a while, I wondered how their kitchen must be.  I cringed everytime I looked down, so I tried not to while I was eating. I also noticed they stacked dirty dishes and cups at the front drink station where they make the teas and desserts. I honestly was hesitant to eat my food after ordering, but still did. The employees are also questionable because when I said I needed a few minutes to order she just sighed, stood next to my table with her arms crossed, and literally didn't leave until I decided. It was a weird experience. The salt and pepper pork chops were good, but I probably won't come back. I will gladly pay a higher price for my park chops at a cleaner and better restaurant than this place."}
{"text":"Empty, food tasted good. Lacks all kinds of presentation, protein portions aren't satisfying. Would come here again but just for the crispy chicken and BBQ."}
{"text":"A gem in Las Vegas Chinatown! Decent food, good service, low prices. $5.95 for a whole Chinese Style fried chicken!"}
{"text":"I took my boyfriend and his family here for dinner. It was funny since everyone turned to stare at us. I am Asian and my boyfriend and his family are Caucasian. Everyone was very friendly although surprised.

We ordered the Crispy Sole which was so crispy and delicious! We also ordered the assorted green vegetables, house special fried rice, vegetable flat noodle/chow fun, and cashew chicken. 

Everything was absolutely delicious and very affordable. Service was excellent. We will definitely recommend this place for authentic Chinese food."}
{"text":"The worse service that we have we are from texas  everytime we visit Las Vegas we see to it that we will visit to this place, our lady server is nice but the only RUDE to us is the skinny lady name Mei  in the front  counter when I pay my bill and I gave $10 tip she is not happy about  it she yell to our server and told her that I gave only $10 when I ask her how much shld be she says shld be 15% but we are only 2 and she yell again, when I ask our server  I need to talk to the manager or the owner the skinny lady says \"i dont care i dont care\" and starting throwing spoon and fork in the sink and keep on talking \"im tired i'm the cashier, server,\" blah blah , I really need to talk tonthe owner name Kevin, this kind of employee shld not work with your business"}
{"text":"Was recommended here by a friend who said that this was one of the very few places in LV which served up dishes like beef bittermelon and steamed pork hash with salty fish. Service was fast and friendly. Also clean but nothing fancy. Their roast duck was plump and juicy but so-so in taste. I was a little disappointed that they didn't have roast pig but only char siu for their BBQ. We usually go to Sam Woo a block away but their prices are quite higher and their service sucks. We decided to go back for lunch the next day to have the beef brisket noodle with siu gao and won ton. Was kind of disappointed when I got only three little dumplings and something that resembled beef brisket. Could have had more brisket in my opinion instead of couple of small pieces hidden under the noodles. That was my only minor complaint but the soup stock was dynamite. Will be back there on our next trip to Vegas."}
{"text":"Grabbing some food after landing from an evening flight is a must, and this is probably my family's preference of places since it's open late and has consistently good food. It actually used to be a favorite a few years back when it had just opened and offered $5.95 late-night specials after 11pm. Good stuff, good stuff. I don't believe they have them anymore since they're not advertised anymore. But we never bothered to ask, so someone please let me know if I'm missing out on some good deals. =]

So we usually stick with a select few items from the menu: the noodles - Hong Kong pan-fried noodles, Singapore noodles, and other noodles I don't know how to say in English; congee - either with fish or pork/preserved egg, and don't forget to add pepper!; and the water dumpling soup - kind of like wontons, but better (ask for some hot water to add to the soup if it's too salty). The XO stir-fried beans are also very good, and I hear the salt & pepper squid is as well. Yummy. The service is okay most of the time, although the guy was pretty rude the last time we went. It's cool, though. It's nothing fancy, but this joint's worth checking out, I think."}
{"text":"I used to like this place but  the waitress are rude specially the one with long hair. Their food are okey but the service will surely ruin your appetite."}
{"text":"For the price and quality of the food its perfect whenever you need a quick fix for Chinese food cravings...  Unlike Panda Express, at least the cooks are Asian lol...Theres a lot of negative reviews on the service but I have never had a problem here."}
{"text":"This place has excellent pan fried Sea Bass.  Ask for it crispy in the soy sauce.  Everytime I am in Vegas I gotta have the fish with fried garlic morning glory.  It's the best!"}
{"text":"Definitely not on my favorite list of Chinese restaurants around town. I know someone who is unfortunately in love with Cafe Noodle which caused my recent visit. My first time was 6 or 7 years ago and then I haven't been since until now! The food is better than it was before, but there are other places within walking distance that are better?! I would recommend HK Star which has the same prices during lunch and late dinner and the food is pretty delish. Sorry Cafe Noodle, but I think the public deserves to read this review."}
{"text":"Great inexpensive family style dining Chinese food. Specials price point menu with many family style Chinese favorites categorized  by $4.95, $5.95, $6.95, $7.95. Free bowl of house soup and rice with this option."}
{"text":"I had a major need for noodles! So, of course, we decided on Cafe noodle.  
The noodles were excellent! Everything else was meh, I've had better.  We ordered the salt and pepper wings with great expectations but were majorly disappointed; they lacked the crunchy garlic bits and flavor.  The salted fish fried rice was ok.  
Bottom line, we won't be back anytime soon.  There is nothing you need to rush over to cafe noodle for.  There are too many other places doing it better.  

Noodles were really good though!"}
{"text":"Their wait staff is terrible but what do you expect at a chinese restaurant,. 

Sad to say but the proof is out there..

The place is not so clean.  Their seats are eh.

Food comes Out quick and that doesn't mean it's pre cooked, Chinese food is just cooked fast.

Their prices are really good! 

They have a late night five dollar specially I've yet to try but my normal orders are usually:

Jelly fish, roast duck, whole deep fried chicken,dumplings, BBQ pork fried rice, and of course their hong kong style pan fried noodles.

I really love their HK noodles. They're my favorite in town over Joyful House.

After their stint on dirty dining it's hard to return often.

Their hot tea is mediocre but again, their staff sucks."}
{"text":"My go-to Chinese restaurant in Vegas. The service is always great and so is the food. Everything is reasonably priced and portioned. You won't have to worry about being hungry after your meal (especially since they do serve complementary white rice with your order)!

Although it might sound odd, the Cod Filet with Cream of Corn is to die for. It's such a simple concept but no other restaurant serve this eccentric dish! The cream of corn complements the crispiness of the cod. Another favorite dish would be their String Beans with XO Sauce. It is cooked to perfection and the sauce is not too overwhelming. 

The only con would be that parking is a hit or miss. Since it is located in such a busy plaza, you might have to resort to parking at the next plaza over. Sometimes you might get lucky and are able to find a spot in the same plaza, but good luck leaving the plaza with wild, crazy drivers trying to fight for your spot."}
{"text":"They forgot about sea bass. Gave it away to someone else:(. Never got my watermelon drink either. The fried porkchop was was fried with the wrong batter. Im disappointed."}
{"text":"I just ordered takeout here and spent close to $30. Not only were we missing food from our order but we were extremely dissatisfied with how it tasted. I called and was given a series of excuses as to why the food was missing. I have never had Chinese food like this ever. DO NOT GO HERE!!! This place is not even worth one star."}
{"text":"Food was good, not THE best. I was more disappointed with the fact that my Red Bean Icee drink was super nasty. I think I'll leave it to the viet restaurants cause they know how to make their drinks for sure. 

It's never crowded in there (at least the few times I've been there) so getting a seat is never a problem. I'm not sure if that's a good thing or a bad thing."}
{"text":"I felt like I was in a Bay Area restaurant after eating here.  Bay Area = SF for those who aren't from Northern California.  Located at Chinatown but a few blocks away from the main gaudy portion.  It's located at a plaza with two stories and it's on the bottom level.  I was fortunate to have Americanized HK friends who been here before and knew what to order.  Items include:

* Wonton noodle soup - comfort food.  Great when trying to sober up.
* Roast duck noodle soup - comfort food.  Tastier alternative to wonton since the duck fat has more taste.
* Porridge with thousand year old eggs and pork - Thousand year old egg is the black preserved egg.  Filling indeed.
* Fu jian rice - sometimes spelled foukien (sounds like the F word).  Fried rice topped with loads of gravy and meats on top.
* Half tea half coffee drink - hot or cold depending on temperature outside.  Add some condensed milk and you have a flavorful drink with some caffeine."}
{"text":"You can always find me eating here every time I'm in Vegas.  My routine is to play all night, sleep at 9 am, wake up at 2 pm, drag my ass here to eat porridge to rejuvenate myself, then back to the tables.

I always get the Fish fillet with Sampan congee (Yu peen tang jai jok), Seafood congee, and chinese donut (yau ja gwai).

I barely come here for regular dinner food, since I like to explore new restaurants.  But last time, in beginning of November, they had specials on the board.  $5.95 for a WHOLE crispy chicken!!!!  $7.95 for a fried flounder!!!!  So I had to come back and eat that.  I got these two dishes with a pea sprout dish and I was in heaven.  To top it off, I asked for Ginger Green Onion (gerng yeung) for the chicken and I was like a fat boy in a candy store.  Total bliss."}
{"text":"I just moved to Las Vegas from San Francisco... so I have cravings for good Cantonese food here and there.  Good Chinese food is here in Vegas.  Good Cantonese -- not easy to find.  But Cafe Noodle and Chinese Barbeque is not bad.

Look, there's a special after 11 pm.  You can order dishes for $5-$7 off a specials list.  I highly recommend it.  It's where I go when I miss home and need to eat some home cookin'."}
{"text":"Ok, I am not going to talk about the service too much because I think It's a cultural issue. their wait service is NOT friendly at all. The waitress and waiter do not know how to smile.

However, I have to say that the service never detracts us from going there. The reason is the food is so good. If you are there during there lunch special, try the shredded pork pan fried noodles order it \"Hong Kong Style\"

Our second favorite dish is the salt and pepper shrimps with the head on. Some people find eating the head weird, but it is so rich.

The third dish to try is the salt fish and chicken fried rice. Salty but really good. I know this is not the typical \"American ordering Chinese food\" (i.e. General Cho's Chicken and Shrimp fried rice) type of order but trust me These are the best things on the menu."}
{"text":"This is my new go-to place for good, cheap, late-night eats.

Going on from 10pm-2am they have a $4.95 menu with a number of pretty decent items. I happened to order salt & pepper porkchops, beef with oyster sauce, and a whole order fried chicken ($5.95). The porkchops were great, the beef was good, and the chicken had that satisfying crispy skin that I was looking for. Though, the chicken itself was a somewhat dry. They give you a side of sweet and sour sauce that helps with that.  

 Two people completely satisfied for under $20. Definitely coming back again for another go."}
{"text":"Food is alright .... Service sucks the big one...waited 30 min 4 take out.. Would not go back ..there are other places w/better service & food..."}
{"text":"Our family discovered this restaurant last years. We liked the. Simple Chinese food and the prices were inexpensive. We just visited this cafe twice in a week. The first trip we found a used tea bag in the tea pot  the server gave us. I brought it to the Manager attention and he apologized sincerely. he explained that sometimes customers bring their own tea bag into the restaurant. Since we enjoyed the food, we decided to let the matter rest. Two days later, we visited this restaurant again. The food was reasonably tasty. However, when we asked for the bill, that is when our entire experience went down the drain! We normally do not check the items listed on the receipt and like many we merely pay the total amount as shown. This time for no reason we checked the items listed on the bill and found out shockingly that an item of $3/- was automatically added into the bill without even informing the customer! Normally we leave cash on the table but in this instance we were shocked! how can a waitress or establishment secretly and automatically add on \"tips\" onto the bill and not inform the customer? Also if we did not even notice the \"tips\" we would have double tip bec we always leave 20% behind anyway! When we confronted the waitress and asked how can she do such a secretive billing, she merely tried to cover it up by giving ridiculous reasons ..she explained that when the convention is in town, they always add automatic tip onto every customer bill. Such practice left us totally disgusted and we pledged we will not visit this establishment ever. We learn now to check every item on the bill because you never know what extra item can be added. 

Alash a cheating waitress drove away future customer business...what a shame!"}
{"text":"Food is good for the price. The place is pretty big with lots of big family table. The lunch menu starts off at 5 dollars ! Very good service for Chinatown!!!! I ordered preserved vegetables with intestines and ma po tofu. Both very authentic! I always take my family here!"}
{"text":"Came here late night and the people were very friendly and nice. They don't stay and chat but they were welcoming. There is a language barrier.. Maybe that's why other yelpers think the waiters are rude. 

 Anyways we ordered congee, wonton soup, spicy eggplant, hot tofu and some other stuff. The prices for these dishes were super cheap! It was like $4.95 for the soup! It's pretty much a robbery. The food was very flavorful too! I've got nothing bad to say really. 
 
 Bottom line is I would definitely go here again! Food was ridiculously cheap and pretty bomb. I would go here even if they slapped me in the face."}
{"text":"The wife and i went there two days in a row. The duck was great, the price for 1/2 duck was cheap, Mongolian beef, BBQ pork with soft noodles tasted wonderful, this place is cheap the food is good and it is always loud there. The staff seems to be friendly, the place itself was OK. Will go back"}
{"text":"came here mainly because they close late and we were hungry. we ordered mongolian beef, kung pao chicken and their wonton noodle soup (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/cafe-noodle-and-chinese-barbeque-las-vegas?select=8UiNNR3cVaxzUVHi3UoCDw#_ZG9jqs7lvtN91AgXe23Ww). the mongolian beef and kung pao chicken dishes were okay, but i wouldnt recommend the wonton noodle soup. 

service is great and the food comes out quick."}
{"text":"Authentic chinese food, little to no wait, and a local's joint! what's not to like about good chinese food at a non-vegas price?

Since vegas is practically my second home, this is my go-to place for chinese food. It's next to the all so popular chinatown plaza, but does not have their obnoxious crowds of tourists. The egg noodle in their noodle soup is al dente, which is the way it should be! This is hard to find in most chinese restaurants nowadays. Another mouth-watering dish is their fried rice with dried scallop and asparagus! Drool!!"}
{"text":"My go to place in most cases for Chinese food. My previous review still stands. They now have $5 specials for lunch and late night dining (10pm-2am). On this visit we had the Salt & Pepper pork chops, Peppered Beef over noodles, Chicken w/ spicy Hoi Sin sauce and Cod with ginger and onions. Everything was delicious and tasty but the chicken dish had too many bamboo shoots for my taste. Service was quick and friendly."}
{"text":"A roach crawled across our table right after we received our bill. How convenient! Was this part of the authentic ambience? UGH. I finished that last roach..err, I mean roasted duck with glee. And those MSG pan-fried veggies? Oh honey, I requested a second serving.  Then that fucking cucaracha caught my eye in the very end.  In hindsight, I should've told them and cursed them out, but I just wanted to get the fuck out of there. Unfortunately, paranoia and thoughts of roaches crawling everywhere in the kitchen invaded my psyche afterwards. My insides felt like shit. 

When we arrived at Ichiza for dessert, I threw up in the bathroom. Glamorous, I know. But I wanted that shit out of my system. I downed a bottle of beer and water hoping it would make me feel better. It did. My brilliant rationale is the alcohol would help vanquish those germs. Thus, dodging food poisoining. I woke up today feeling fine. Yesterday was my first and last visit."}
{"text":"I don't know how this place survives..... the food was dirt cheap!!!   I've been to this place several times and it always amazes me how they can serve my Chinese favorite foods so cheaply."}
{"text":"Best damn green beans I have ever had.. I don't like the way they cut their lemons.. and their tea is yummy.. I would suggest comming here for the green beans not for the lemons.. if you like good lemons go somewhere else.. but the food and service is great !!"}
{"text":"bumped into this place by accident, but to my surprise it was real gem. The food was excellent and price are awesome. We had roast duck and bbq pork, some porriage and shrimp wanton noodle. Overall excellent food and quick service."}
{"text":"You really want to go here for the unbeatable prices and huge selection on the menu... lunch specials and late-nights specials for under $5. Generous portions... you can't beat that type of deal!

There is nothing extraordinary about the food but every now and then, I love stopping here with my boyfriend to eat hearty and cheap. It is actually one of his favorite restaurants in Vegas. 

Last night I ordered the cod filet with tofu.. that is a new favorite! They were able to make it spicy for my taste. It wasn't quite spicy enough, but I don't expect deadly sauce from a Chinese place ;). The dish was fantastic regardless. 

Overall, this is definitely a place I recommend!"}
{"text":"Dont get me wrong ...the food was good ...i give it 4 stars ... but overall experience was a 3 they gave me tea almost when food was done ... and were. Real jewish on the meat ... i meat i only had like 5 pieces of small meat in dish...and one was a nerve eh ... so yeah the  not enough meat to porport to the dish really turned me off ...and due to that alone i dont think ill be back :/

..but iver all u really cant beat the price its wicked cheap so its good if ya on a bit of a budget i was actually astonished when the bill came to me .. it was like around 10ish so its ok i dont wish to hate .... i like to be as positve as i can on dishing out coments... so that being said the places isnt bad ..."}
{"text":"This place is gross, even for chinese standards, coming from an asian person.  I'm used to bad customer service, especially at chinese restaurants, but these girls take it to a whole another level.  The dining room has the sense of a public bathroom, and their restrooms are absolutely wretched, vomit inducing .  Seriously, put some money into the bathrooms at least."}
{"text":"Well, how do I start this? 
We came in and ordered our dinner. By the way, back to the order. Our we ordered and waited as usual. 10 minutes later, still waiting. 20 minutes later, and I am like, did she get the order in? 30 mins later, I finally got my food. Overall, the taste was okay, but the service was horrendous."}
{"text":"Meh. Went there a couple weeks ago. Prices are okay for the quality. Stingy with their refills, but helpful and patient wait staff. Go there if you know what you're doing, not if you're a novice. I didn't like that they pointed out that I didn't write a tip amount on the receipt. (I'd rather leave the tip on the table.) Large food portions, but honestly if I had known the name and location of the place my friend gets take out from (Joyful a couple blocks down,) I would have spent my money there. Will not be returning."}
{"text":"Had the salt and pepper pork chops, chow fun with gravy, honey walnut shrimp, and roast duck. It was okay, not as great as I was expecting and not as tasty as other honest restaurants I've been too. But customer service was good!"}
{"text":"Great place! 

Food was excellent. Some of the best HK style food I've had. Service was great and the food came out fast. 

I highly recommend it if you need a break from all the buffets!

I'm definitely coming back on my next trip to vegas!"}
{"text":"This place serves arguably the best fried rice in Las Vegas. Like i always tell my friends, if you want to judge the standard of a chinese restaurant, always start of with a plate of Fried Rice. This seemingly easy dish is actually very complicated and requires alot of delicate effort to create.
 From the type of rice, fire and wok control, you can tell how skillful are the chef. If a chinese restaurant cannot even get the simplest fried rice correct, how could u expect the rest of the dishes to be good? 
This was my second time at the restaurant, the last time i was here i was a good 1 year ago and i didn't want to write a review based on my semi - hungover judgement. So this time, i took a huge amount of effort to convince my colleagues to try it. 
So there are a bunch of different fried rice to choose from, you have the classic Yang Chow Fried Rice, which is a benchmark for the restaurant, to the more exotic and adventurous salted fish fried rice. What i can tell you is that their fried rice, no matter which choice you make, you are bound for a great meal. Besides, for about 8 dollars a plate, the portion of the fried rice is HUGE. If you are a small eater, you can definitely share a plate with your partner. 
Another thing to note here is that they serve porridge as well, although not the best I've tasted around the world, it does brings me the nostalgic feeling from the days I've been in Hong Kong."}
{"text":"Atmosphere can be a little louder than I'd like at times, but they've got great shrimp and pork wonton soup!!  Didn't order duck today, but I've had it here a couple of times and it's also really good!"}
{"text":"We are back after a while. It has changed hands a few times and the other times were not good. We heard the original owner took over it and we had to try again. Glad we did and we were not disappointed at all. 

Quality of food for the price was good. Service was friendly for a Chinese restaurant,  in my opinion could use a bit of training. We ordered soda and they brought the soda can,  we had to ask for straw with glass of ice.

Anyways,  overall will definitely be back."}
{"text":"This place is actually not bad for you're run of the mill chinese food late night cravings. Ok well they do have some Americanized chinese food. Wait....NO ORANGE CHICKEN! WOO HOO! But they do have Lemon chicken....Chicken deep fried in batter and lemon sauce all over it. Ok just dump my chicken in Lemon Merangue Pie...WTF??? it was hot chicken and it was Lemon pie filling...kinda. It was...ok. Did you read my review on Lil Dumpling and their strawberry chicken....Yea... back away from the pies chinese people!
Their oxtail hotpot was great. Except it was a little buried in fancy garde manger carrot slices which if you know me...Not a big carrot fan. Had some beef and chicken fried rice. YUM O - and the scallion pancakes....mmmm bok choy and garlic. Good for your brains....fried chicken....But they served it with sweet and sour. If I wasn't with people who were very leery of real chinese food I would be a little bit more crazy about it. But it's ok - I can come back alone when I can have the real stuff...BTW. Duck is a fatty poulet. Uhm....If you want lean duck. Raise it yourself. Put it on a treadmill daily....When it gets all buff. Then you can eat it. Or bring it to this place!"}
{"text":"I really like this place! Always what I expect from a legit Chinese restaurant: so-so service, and cheap but good food! 

I had yang chow fried rice, salt pepper pork chops and deep fried sole fish. Everything was on point! My fish was a little on the oily side, but I'm in a Chinese restaurant which is why it is expected. Haha:)"}
{"text":"This is a 24 hr Chinese restaurant . Late night special for $5 equates to $15 dollar a la carte from most restaraunts. A must for people who are out late after 12:00 AM."}
{"text":"Horrible customer service! They made a mistake with your order but they don't make it right! That old lady with short hair beware when you order food from her. Make it clear for her to understand or else she will give you a different food or not list your order at all!"}
{"text":"one of the best in town..I like the steam chicken and the salt and pepper crab,  and the deep fried chicken is moist and tasty..the melon juice is fresh too..must try.......highly recommend"}
{"text":"Should've checked the yelp reviews and not wasted my time on the other similar noode places and just descend upon this one instead. This place is located below Ichiza in the same plaza, a little hidden, but worth it if you want some Hong Kong stye Cantonese food.

We went for breakfast so ended up ordering the jook (rice porridge), some gon chao ngau hor (flat noodles with beef and bean sprouts), fried tofu for the young man and some Cantonese style sui gao (dumplings). 

The gon chao ngau hor smelled wonderful and tasted pretty good. Only thing was it was super greasy. I think next time I'll have to tell them to go easy on the oil. The jook was really nice on a cold morning. Portions are much smaller here. The bowl of jook is about what you'd get when you go to dim sum, not when you go to a restaurant that has jook on the menu. 

The sui gao weren't bad at all -- I mean it's not like what you'll get in HK but since I can't just hop on a plane every time I'm craving something like this, I'll just have to make do.

I noticed that everything in Vegas is a buck or two more than in Orange County, but the fact that you can get Cantonese food like this alone in Vegas means just pay up and shut up."}
{"text":"I typically get the shredded pork noodles and the duck noodle soup. The food is delicious and the menu has a great variety of Chinese cuisine, along with familiar dishes that make me comfortable inviting friends who don't like to venture too far with their meal. The dining area was recently remodeled and much more welcoming and contemporary. Plus it's in a great plaza if you want to go get boba or visit a bar afterwards."}
{"text":"I really like this place. I think it will be my to go Chinese food fix. Don't expect great service but the food is solid. We went for lunch and they had dishes ranging from 5 to 8 bucks!  Where can you find a better deal?  We ordered the beef chow fun, cod with veggies and eggplant clay pot. Before food came, they gave us free soup!  I didn't know what it was but it was delicious!

The dishes came relatively quickly and rice was complimentary I believed. The beef chow fun was very good and the beef was tender and not chewy. The eggplant clay pot was a little oily but the flavors were on point. I also liked the cod and veggies. Veggies were a little tough but still delicious.  All in all the flavors were heavy but satisfying. Will definitely come back and try new stuff.

Not sure if dinner is as cheap but the three dishes cost is 21 bucks :)"}
{"text":"Jelly fish, porridge, fried rice, fish, chicken wings, noodles, fried tofu... I ate them all and it was fantastic. Among my favorites were the jelly fish and noodles. Any kind of noodles, really. You can't go wrong.

On top of that for a group of 12 people, the price was amazingly cheap and you didn't even have to ask them to refill the tea."}
{"text":"I've come here a few times really late and had a late night menu which was a deal- now though it's disappeared...I'm mostly down for late night eats but.... It's okay, lunch is a great deal here for $5 and a good size that I cannot finish. All have been decent, but one in particular that came out great was some short ribs w/ a sweet plum sauce I had one night with my cousin, BBQ pork was juicy and rice porridge here hit the spot one night, but man...if you eff up something that simple as porridge- big fail as it's virtually a no fail comfort food. 

Service isn't that great here usually, but I think it's much better during the day than night. Night people seem, tired and cranky, but at least the food has been consistent. I'll come back for the $5 lunch."}
{"text":"Late night after gambling. Tasty and cheap! Open late past 1am! Exactly what I expect from a Chinese joint"}
{"text":"Dirty floors, Dirty tables, Terrible customer service, Dirty bathrooms, overpriced menu......"}
{"text":"I give it a 3 star because THE SERVICE SUCKS MY ROOMMATE'S DOG'S LEFT NUT!

OK don't get me wrong the food is great and all i really love their salt and pepper pork  chops but I hate dealing with the service here,, I mean DAMN these freaking CHINESE Restaurants are just rude.. What's new right? First off I came in for the lunch specials.. So freaking dirt cheap a bum can afford it! i got the salt and pepper pork chops for only 5$ What a deal right? So the bill comes and I usually pay with my credit card because I like to get my points. But the lady was so freaking rude and said NO! THERE IS A 10$ MINIMUM.. IM LIKE WTF you had no SIGN that says there was a minimum.I asked her if there was an ATM she looks at me like IM FRICKING FOREIGN and says no i don't know.... So i ended up ordering two of the same thing one to go. Oh wells good thing I like their food.. Long story short.. I love their Food but their service sucks and they have no manners... Im assuming the 4 star rating is for food! and not for service.. Be warned you will not get good service.. but awesome food tho! Would I go back YES because I love their food. Just crappy service.. Act like it's DICk's ( The rude restaurant at Excalibur) and just learn to ignore them and give them a CHEAP TIP! maybe they would get the hint their service sucks.."}
{"text":"Service wasn't all that great.  The food is good I heard their salt and spicy chicken wings are grub but they didn't have any?!?  My sister recommends this place I tried it with my brother and sister in law the Tofu was Yummy last time.  This time I came with my mom, niece and son and tried their Fried Fish special and chicken chow mein, I wish I knew what kind of fish it was.   The server was saying what sounded like swordfish but what was plated wasnt swordfish.  Either way food was okay the service was eh."}
{"text":"Really bad restaurant honestly, REALLY SLOW SERVICE, 15+ minutes to wait for food and honestly really bad service for the most part, they never check up on us. Also, the restroom is really dirty and nasty inside. The music is too loud or too quiet sometimes and the manager half the time was saying \"Hello?\" Out loud into the microphone without ever specifying what he wants to say. The food is overall salty and a disappointment to eat. The rice is OK, not too mushy or too dry, and honestly, it was the only good think at the restaurant. Improve your service and not be so freaking slow next time and maybe I might consider coming again, never again will I be back"}
{"text":"I am definitely not in love, but if you show up between 3-5pm, you can get a very sweet deal. First of all, they have $4.95 lunch specials from 11am-5pm, so regardless of your vampire schedule, you can pretty much bet the special is happening. If you have impeccable timing, however and can stall lunch until 3pm or perhaps go for an early dinner at 4:30pm, you can get a free large milk coffee or milk tea with your entree. The ice coffee is superior to the tea in case you were wondering. This is an amazing deal given that an iced coffee can set you back at least $2.50 elsewhere.

As for the interior, it is a step below okay, but close enough to okay to not offend. If you are used to Chinatown-esque restaurants, you will be just fine. The service was a bit abrupt, definitely not a bright spot. When the Mr. tried to ask about getting a vegetable mei fun as a special, he received a very abrupt: \"If it is not on menu, you can not get it. Mei fun has fish cakes.\" The tone was enough to prevent any further questioning, so he accepted the fish cakes, and I ordered the stir fried mixed vegetables without any questions. 

The food was good. Not too saucy, and the mixed vegetables were all true vegetables: no baby corn, water chestnuts, bamboo shoots or odd fungus.  Despite the sea of fish cakes, the noodles were also tasty. There are definitely some experienced men in the kitchen, as everything was hot and seasoned appropriately. 

For $4.95, it is hard to beat. A little smile from the server might have edged me over to four stars. I might have to give it a second shot to see if there is a friendlier server on a different day."}
{"text":"I just flew in from out of town that afternoon...and after a lazy evening of napping, talking, and kind of getting pretty, we finally made it out to grub before we hit the strip.  I have a pretty much constant craving for asian noodle soup, so we decided to go to Chinatown, since my Vegas resident friend said that it was the ONLY place to get asian food.  

We randomly drove down the street and saw this place...\"Cafe NOODLE...blah blah blah.\"  That was the place for me!  It was around midnight, and we were dressed up in very small pieces of clothing, but the waiters still made us feel comfortable.  He pointed us to the Beef Brisket & Egg Noodle Soup, so that's what we got (me without wontons and my friend with wontons).  

We weren't expecting much...after all....we just found any place with noodle soup and got whatever was suggested. But MAN...it was GOOOOOODDDDD!!!!!!! The broth....beefy goodness without feeling overwhelmed by the beefiness.  The noodles were JUST the right texture  to complement the beefy broth.  And there were HUGE chunks of beef, the kinf that breaks apart easily and it attached to a huge piece of tendon/fat.  I know it's bad, but i've always specifically loved those fatty/tendony pieces of meat.  I got like....10 huge pieces in that little bowl!!!   It was...to die for.  So good, that we both ate the whole thing, were so full that we wanted to sleep, and we decided to go home instead of go clubbing. hahaha.  Any food that can do that to a couple of club girls MUST be amazing.  

Next time I'm in Vegas i'm going to make her take me again ;)"}
{"text":"I was introduced to this restaurant about four years ago and it was a great, affordable place for families and friends to eat at. They categorize their menus by prices starting with $4 family style plates and up from there. One small bowl of rice is included with your entree but if you wanted more rice you would need to pay $2 extra for it. I always ordered the salt and pepper pork chops, chow fun, and black bean chicken! You could also ask for their hot tea because it goes well with your dish. 

I love their food but there are some problems with this restaurant. Initial thought is the restaurant is nice but once you are seated you will notice dirt/ stains on your eating utensils. They do not wash it good, as a matter of fact I always used my napkin to wipe off any excess dirt and my napkin would be filled with brown stains. Tables and chairs are still dirty. When I let the servers know about it they are rude. They speak in another language to each other aggressively and give my party and I a mean stare as they go to get another set of eating utensils. Customer service is bad here, you will not have a good experience with them. I don't get it? They sit and watch TV and get up whenever a customer flags them down... they're chillin at work! Card minimum is $10, lies! They sometimes enforce it and sometimes they don't, they just want you as the customer to spend more. One time I paid with card and was going to tip with cash so when I put \"$0\" on the receipt to sign off my card, the server gives it back to me and says she can't accept it without the tip... wait, what? I told her I was going to tip cash then she switched up her rude attitude. She didn't apologize to me and obviously I knew she was getting rowdy because she thought she wasn't going to get a tip. 

I was a regular here but they ended up being on dirty dining and their servers are the worse! The only good thing about this place is their prices on their food, good price for the amount you get."}
{"text":"I dont really have nothing to say about the FOOD. Their food is amazing i just got a little bit disappointed about the service the last night i ate here. Dont get me wrong i always eat here with friends and family theres a lot of good server but my last one hmmm.."}
{"text":"I usually go eat here with my relatives in Vegas whenever I go visit them. It's the usual go-to for Chinese food. We are a group of 8 including my family and my aunt's family. We were seated pretty quickly, at around 10:30 pm. Customer service is pretty similar to other Chinese restaurants - quick, immediate, sometimes impatient but not really. 

We ordered some different drinks, they had coke, diet coke, hot tea, and they even served thai tea drinks that were really good as well. We usually order an array of different Chinese food, from fried pork chops, to pan fried noodles, and vegetables, and my family at their fried soul fish (which I personally cannot eat due to my allergies). What I really enjoy trying out in every Chinese restaurant is their orange chicken, and this spot has really good orange chicken - not too sweet, but with added spice and flavor. I practically finished the whole plate myself! 

Overal, pretty decent chinese food joint. Great for families, lunches, and late night dinners."}
{"text":"If you think the only places you can get full off of $5 is subways and the extra value meals at fast food joints.... WRONG!!! Cafe Noodle offers a surprising amount of wholesome dishes for $4.95. My hubby and I went after to work to see what the fuss was all about. The restaurant seemed kind of run down, but the food makes up for it. We ordered whole fried chicken served with sweet and sour sauce, beef chow fun, Chinese broccoli, and salt & pepper pork chops. The food was actually really good and the portions were more then generous. The Chinese broccoli was slightly steamed with the perfect amount of oyster sauce, the thing that makes great chow fun is when the beef is tender, the noodles tasted fresh because it wasn't mushy or soggy and the bean sprouts were firm, not wilted. The salt and pepper pork chops are smaller than most locations but not as fatty... mmmmm.... so good with their chili sauce. Lastly, a whole fried chicken for $4.95? Come on this deal is better than Costco & Sam's Club! Our chicken was juicy to the bone and the skin was extra crispy with that 'crunch'.... this place is definitely worth it if you want good happy hour that isn't bar food. Try it!!!"}
{"text":"I'm from both NY and LA.  I couldn't understand why Chinese food sucks so bad in Vegas compared to the other major cities.  I finally learned it is because all the head chefs go to the major cities and all the sous chefs go to secondary towns like Vegas to try to fool the locals.

Tonight I ordered 4 things:
Fried Tofu, Eggplant, Brisket Curry, and Peking Porkchops. 

The fried tofu was the only thing done right, but of course, they're frozen and just refried. To mess up this dish would be like ruining french fries.  Possible but unlikely.  They're cut into large squares which strange, traditionally in Asia they're only a quarter of the size.  The point is to eat more fried surface, not less.

The eggplant, the sauce was.......... super American it was a sweet sauce which is strange and looked like it was a spin-off of barbecue sauce.

The brisket curry had no brisket, it was 100% tendon.  Plus I don't care where you go or what anyone says,  you don't add green peppers into curry dishes.  Just like when you find carrots in your beef and broccoli or peas in your fried rice.  They didn't do this because someone in the kitchen has a culinary passion.  No, not for 7.98, they did this to fill the dish and make it look bigger.   I'd rather have a smaller bowl of curry but it is done right like in authentic Indian joints.

The Peking Porkchops.   Do you like ketchup? its just fried pork smothered in ketchup except it was even more acidic.  You can smell the added vinegar from a mile away.  It was awful.
We barely ate any of it and when we got the check, no one cared why we barely touched the food.  

They then handed me the bill on an American Express tray and handed me back my card saying they don't take American Express.  I pointed to the logo and laughed.   

I looked around and realized what I had done wrong.  EVERYONE ELSE ordered a bowl of noodles.  Like some type of wonton noodle variation with duck or something.

In summary, if you come here just get the wonton noodle bowl and stfu,  don't order anything else.  its a nightmare and it's too tall of an order for their service ability."}
{"text":"I came here on a Monday for lunch and got beef chow fun to-go for $6.43

- Ready in 10min 
- Great lunch specials. As cheap at 4.95
- Cheapest chow fun I have ordered and still at a good quality. 
- Chow fun taste very similar to Wendy's Noodle Cafe. 
- Enough to share for 2 and a good portion of beef. 
- Definitely a good place to get food on the good. Can't comment on the dine-in, but wouldn't mind to try it out"}
{"text":"Worst chinese restaurant EVER!!!!! Here's what happened I went for their evening dinner and this nasty fat pig woman in black & pony tail dropped the forks and pretend nothing happened and gave it to my folks. I called her out and she said it's no problem. She left. What kind of service is that? She went to her coworkers to gossip while pointing fingers and laughing as I watched in misery. I still gave a $20 tip despite what was happening. She pick up the bill and cussed out why so little?! Uh Lady,  what did you expect $100? For your poor service? They should fire her for being rude. I do not understand why people still come here.."}
{"text":"What I thought would be a nice lunch with a few of my friends, actually turned out to be a nightmare of an experience. 

The staff is blatantly rude and did not give a warm welcome when my party and I first entered. It continued to go downhill from there because our waitress was curt, and she didn't even seem to care about our table. When she came to take our order, she approached us with a harsh tone. It sounded like she was annoyed, but our party just got there and the restaurant wasn't filled up with people... She then proceeded to cut me and my friends off a few times while we were trying to say what we wanted from the menu. She also kept stopping in the middle of taking our order to have conversations with people in her language, which is okay, but I didn't see it appropriate to have full-on conversations while writing our order down... 

There was another employee who was refilling our drinks and also brought the food out to our table. He wasn't friendly either, and whenever he'd pick up our glasses to refill with water, he would smack it back down so water droplets came out of the cups. Same thing happened with the food. Even with us saying \"thank you\" with a smile and a happy tone, there was no response from him. Way to make your customers feel even more unwelcome...

We ordered the salt and pepper pork chop, BBQ pork with soft noodles, the crispy noodle dish, beef chow fun, and the garlic and onion pork. 

The salt and pepper pork chops were small bits of pan-fried pork ribs. They were a bit salty, but nothing too harsh. They actually were quite good.

The BBQ Pork with soft noodles is just your average \"lo-mein\" type of dish. It wasn't anything amazing, but it was good enough for us to chow down on.

The crispy noodle dish was alright as well; it's crispy until the sauce makes the noodles soggy. The veggies they put in it were green and tasted fresh. 

The chow fun and the crispy noodle dish both looked slimy from the sauce, and the meat in it looked like unidentifiable protein. Anyway, it was good for what we came in for (to eat a bunch of Chinese dishes), but definitely not worth the sit-down experience. The presentation of the food wasn't too appealing, either. It looked like they just slapped it on the plate and expedited it to our table.

Overall, they have a wide selection of different dishes on their menu, but the horrible service was unforgivable. Honestly, I've never been to a restaurant where the workers were this rude to their patrons. A good business should cater to customers to build customer loyalty, but I guess giving out acceptable customer service is just not one of their priorities. 

Sigh... I don't mean to sound like I'm ranting (and typically I'm easy to please), but save yourself from giving your money to a place that doesn't care about your business. If you do decide to try their fare, heed my warning -- you'll get subpar quality food paired with awful service."}
{"text":"Does Cafe Noodle have regular hours? At any given point, in the day, they are running some kind of special. My family came here for the lunch special that runs from 11am-5pm. They have one two sided menu that dictates what you can order and everything is $4.95. 

The best dish was the Mandarin fried pork chops. They were hot, crispy, and thrown in sweet and tangy sauce. Each plate comes with six or seven big pieces and it was hard to resist licking my fingers clean. So good that we ordered a second plate to take home and began to pick at it while waiting for a box. The fried soft tofu with cod was not bad. The filet of fish were moist and tender. The cod with ginger and scallions was delicious, but you must love scallions because they sauteed it with large cut stocks. The pepper beef over rice came with thick slices of tender beef and big chunks of green peppers and onions. The dry beef flat noodles was a generous portion of everything, but was oily. The kung pao squid was tender, and not rubbery, but it was the greasiest of all the dishes. For everything that we got, you would think it would be expensive, but we were able to feast for less than forty dollars. That alone is a reason to love Chinatown. 

Most of the time, Chinese restaurant employees can come off as gruff and curt, but not here. Everyone from the hostess, both servers, and the busboy were quick and attentive. My dad can be straight forward and demanding, if they were annoyed, it didn't show."}
{"text":"Came here because our first restaurant choice was closed. 

Since we're not Chinese, the service was blah.  It took forever for the waitress to come, and when we asked her for her suggestions, she said, \"I don't know what you like, so I don't know.\"  Thanks, that was sooo helpful. 

Their noodle broth dish was good, and so was their chow mein.  I saw many families ordering BBQ duck.  At the end, my dad paid and gave them a big tip because he's nice, and then they started offering more tea and thanking us like we were royalty.  Too late, lady!"}
{"text":"Last time I was at Cafe Noodle was last December. The food was even better than I remembered and hope it still is. The memorable dishes were steamed chicken and stir-fried pea shoots. Everything else was good too. I'll be back next time I'm in LV."}
{"text":"This place is a great place for late dining. We loved the braised tofu dish which was surprisingly delicious as well as the cod with greens.

We will definitely go back the next time we're in Vegas and need late night eats."}
{"text":"Not good. Don't think I'll be coming back here. Food is overpriced for the quality. The beef is slimy. And the wait staff doesn't pay attention."}
{"text":"This place is my favorite for good chinese for a great price. I especially love both the wet and dry beef ho-fun noodles! They get a decent char on the noodles that you can taste and it makes such a huge difference from other places that make the same dish.

My other favorites are the mandarin pork chops, beef hotpot, XO string beans, and the crispy whole fish."}
{"text":"Great food made fresh always. Doesn't take long to become a regular here Some good specials on menu and open till 2am"}
{"text":"This review was suppose to be done a couple months ago.  Started it but didn't finish.  Here it is.  The food is good.  The restaurant was opened in 2011.  Got to try the crisp fried tofu.  Its not your typical Japanese tempera type deep fry stuff.  The cook did a really good job.  Just slightly crisp on the outside and still soft on the inside.  Nicely done.  Almost forgot to mention the restaruant is in Las Vegas Chinatown plaza."}

Chinese food at Noodles Cafe and ...

Food: Good, nicely portion ... It was not the best Chinese food but it was good for a late night meal.

Service: the staff is friendly. They gave us enough attention probably because it late at night.

Atmosphere Setting: where should I start??? Good size restaurant roomy. The whole structure just doesn't match. Makes it look very old. The plates, cups, and utilities is a bit out of date. Need a makeover that's for sure ...

Overall: I would come again for late night meal. Parking is a bit pact! So be prepared!!!"}
{"text":"I have a love and hate relationship with this place. I will start with the positive review. Their food are very affordable with good portion. Many selection in their menu that range from $5-$13 per entree. I love their salt and pepper porkchop. This is just a regular Chinese restuarant to go if you have no nowhere else to try. Ahahaha. Anyways onto the negative review the lady with short hair who is a server is rude !!! Hate the fact this place charges gratuity already I guess for parties over 5? Whatever, but by the time I went to pay for my meal I wanted to do a custom tip Becuase I don't think this service deserves a $15 tip for being rude to us. So I only put $5 and by the time she saw how much I put she threw my card at me and start complaining to her coworker in Chinese/Mandarin I don't know. I just gave her a look and left. I wish they will just fire her so I can just give this place a shot again but I doubt it."}
{"text":"Salt.And.Pepper.PORK.CHOPS. If there ever comes a day that food will never be able to make me fat, I'd come back here everyday just for those pork chops. It's such a simple yet addicting dish that I am currently salivating over as I'm writing this review. 
The prices are also very affordable for the portions that they provide. I went with two other friends last week and we got 3 different dishes (4 in total since we ordered double pork chops), and we still ended up with some left overs. 
I would have given them a full 5 stars, but I just thought the service was not all that inviting.
Overall, I'd still come back for the delicious & affordable food!"}
{"text":"I've been coming to this restaurant since freshman year of college. It's cheap and the food taste great! What I love about this place is that you always get your food really fast! However, service could be better. The waiter didn't even bother refilling our waters!!! Plus whenever we asked a question, they wouldn't respond. I mean they would do what we asked but they would just walk away without saying anything. 

If there was a way for a 2 and a half stars, that's what I would give."}
{"text":"The food is ok nothing great. We had house special crispy noodles ok, spicy eggplant and tofu hotpot way too sweet not even spicy blah, Singapore noodles too much curry flavor overwhelms the taste,  beef chow fun nothing extraordinary overall wouldn't come back one and done for this place"}
{"text":"U I love the good it's amazing authentic but the service sucks but if you can be patient and wait for your food the best place to eat and when you sit down and you order your drink just ask him if they have a picture of Ice-T so you don't die of waiting for a refill"}
{"text":"Ordered 2 orders of each beef broccoli and orange chicken and the serving portions were so little it all fit in one container it wasn't always like this though they use to fill it to a good portion size for the price but now there just skimping it"}
{"text":"Love it! I came with my sister last time to dine in and the guy was super friendly. He helped us find out what we wanted to order since we forgot the Chinese names to the dishes. 

Our bill ended up to be a lot because of the lobster we ordered but damn was it good!!!! I'll be back there as soon as I'm back in Vegas."}
{"text":"The lunch and late night specials are priced right at $5, but honestly, I would pay more for better food.  The food is edible but nothing to rave about.  The service....well, this is a Chinese restaurant.  (I'm Chinese too, so don't send hate mail)"}
{"text":"Not too bad, a little pricey than other Chinese noodle restaurants along Spring Mountain Road.

We had the BBQ duck with noodles comes with a side soup, snow pea leaves in garlic sauce, rice noodle with chicken (wet style), and a platter of 1/2 order of steam chicken comes with a side of garlic, ginger and green onion sauce.

The food is not too bad.  The BBQ duck is delicious and fresh.  

May have to come back for dinner another time."}
{"text":"During a family trip to Vegas a few weeks ago, the parentals insisted that we eat at this place since it's one of their favorite spots when they're visiting sin city.

I was pleasantly surprised that the Cafe was more or less a mom and pop store (absolutely nothing wrong with that!) The people eating inside were definitely locals by the way they interacted with the staff (thumbs up sign for locals!) 

My parents knew what to order - the noodle soup, congee BBQ meats. The wonton noodle soup was BOMB - lightly flavored soup and au dente egg noodles. I didn't try the congee so not sure how that was. We also ordered the e-fu noodles (very generous portion size but noodles were kind of mushy!), baby bok choy (perfectly seasoned and cooked), and seafood soup (pretty good). The BBQ meat was just ok to me. The duck was kind of fatty/greasy and the char siu pork was kind of dry and under seasoned. 

Overall, I would love to go back to this place. I would definitely get a bowl of the noodle soup - for myself!"}
{"text":"It's so sad when you discover that long time favorites suck now... Cafe noodle's duck, won ton, egg noodle soup was always an old fav on cold nights, but I haven't done it in a while due to all the great ramen places that keep popping up. 

Today was the first time in 10 years of coming here that everything about it was pretty crappy. Salty, but otherwise flavorless duck, won ton is missing the chunks of shrimp that have always been there. Add to that some pretty bland broth, and you have a good sized bowl of sadness and disappointment. 

Quality of our other usuals have also gone down in the past year or so - beef chow fun, Singapore noodles, salt & pepper pork chops and the whole friend chicken. Hate to say it, but I'm almost ready to give up on this place"}
{"text":"Authentic Chinese food.  The place was full for lunch and we looked like the only tourists.  Great values for lunch starting at $4.95.  The soups are huge and yummy!  We ate here by accident first time here and sought it out on second trip.  Held out 1 star as the service was lacking.  Had to wait for some dishes and had to ask for things multiple times.  Everyone's very nice, just slow when busy."}
{"text":"Great food definitely a go to Chinese food place in Las Vegas. I had a grilled pork and the seafood noodle medley HK style. It was all delicious. Staff is attentive but not overbearing. They take all major credit cards. I have been there twice can would go back again. And I believe they're open late. you can't beat the price either."}
{"text":"I'm often in here with a large group of people over 8, and every time they have been very consistent with our orders (even remembering who got what out of a large party), and they are more than happy to serve us despite how we usually stay up until closing time.

Tasty dishes, a little bit on the greasy side with some of them, and if you're vegetarian the menu is limited to about 4 choices you can choose from (the pan fried vegetable mix is a smaller portion than I'd like it to be), but for everything else you get a pretty good deal ($5 a head? You can dine like a king!) I'm giving this place four stars because the service has always been friendly and attentive, and most plates you really get the bang for your buck! This place is perfect for those in larger groups, they don't seem to mind in the least! ;)"}
{"text":"Ordered To-go. They boxed up food warmed up from day before :( must have had change in ownership. Prices went up and food quality went south. Salt and pepper pork chop and rice was old."}
{"text":"Our family loved it...we came here with a party of 23.  This was a casual dinner for my cousin and her family from Georgia.  The kids had a table for themselves and they were grubbin'.  The waiters were very helpful with the menu.  Our favorites are the salt and pepper shrimp, salt and pepper pork chops and salt and pepper squid...hmmm...did we miss another salt & pepper dish?? LOL.....  The best dish was the beef hot pot. Yummmmm!!!! Even the most finicky of the family enjoyed it. We were stuffed!!!  ;o)"}
{"text":"I was craving Won Ton Egg Noodle soup &&my mom was raving about this place of where her coworker brought in ToGo. 

My mom ordered from the splendid Lunch Special menu (which had a pretty good selection of tasty sounding entrees) &&got the Black peppered pork w/ soft noodles. I opted for the BBQ Duck, Won Ton in Egg Noodle Soup

Overall: it was deelish and since my mom barely touched her plate, We still had leftover for this morning. 

Must try since its located in the heart of Chinatown, once you're done you can head to Tea Station located a couple of units down for a drink."}
{"text":"Despite logic, we tried to eat here. One star because there's not an option for zero. Keep walking or driving to somewhere else. It start going downhill with the smell of rancid fish when you walk in. I've been to other places like that but the food was good. We had a noodle bowl, egg rolls, and kung pao chicken. The noodle bowl was a mess with no taste, the egg rolls were mostly hot nasty oil, and the Kung pao was all onions and peppers with 10 small pieces of chicken. Not recommended."}
{"text":"This place was okay. 
Took a while to get our food.
They have really good prices.
$10 minimum for credit/debit."}
{"text":"Lunch (11am-5pm) & Late Night Specials (for $4.95, and the portions are generous, definitely the right spot to hit up for decent hot meal on a glacial global economic recovery budget.  That was how I felt about the economy back in 2011. Vegas has definitely recovered a lot from the dismal lows, but not really back to what it was before the crash.  So I continue to seek out decent restaurants that is budget friendly, and Café Noodle & Chinese Barbeque continues to be near the top of my list for curing hunger on a tight budget.

Like many other Yelpers have mentioned, the restaurant is not the cleanest.  Even after clearing a recently vacated table and sanitizing it, it still feels not quite clean. Maybe it is that lingering thin film of grease or they simply needed to use a cleaner rag to clean the tables.  Well, at least the utensils and tea cups are clean.

Anyway, I ended up here at Cafe Noodle and Chinese Barbeque, a restaurant that I have walked past numerous times to other businesses in this super busy plaza with the ridiculously inadequate parking spaces. However, the American name is completely foreign to me, and to locate it I had to look up the driving direction.  The place was relatively crowded at 11pm on a Tuesday night, and pretty much every patron was Asians.  I immediately sensed a good vibe that this place must be at least decent.

After looking over the menu, I opted for the Salt & Pepper Chicken Wings appetizer (tasty but on the greasy side, occasionally not very flavorful due to insufficient amount of \"salt & pepper\") and the Pan Fried Noodles with Beef and Vegetable (very large portion and pretty flavorful).  The food is not high end, but for the prices they are charging you, it is well worth it.  That was from my very first visit back in 2011, and the incomplete review draft sat and sat and sat some more until now.

So two years have gone by and several visits later (both dine-in and take-out), my impression remained roughly the same.  Service for the most part is their weak point.  Not the friendliest or most attentive, but occasionally you will get a waiter that stepped up his game (a refreshing change). Then there are times when you end up standing there for 5 minutes wanting to place an order and be completely ignored by the lady behind the counter and ultimately walk out and head across the street to another near 24/7 Chinese restaurant that is just as good, if not better.

The food at great value is what keeps me coming back once I get over their latest service mishaps. 
What I do recommend here:
* 2 BBQ Items Combo on Rice (I usually get their BBQ Duck and Soya Chicken) - it will set up back $8.75
* Spicy Eggplant Hot Pot - one of my favorites
* Salted Fish & Chicken Fried Rice - I usually get this to go plus something else. Slightly adventurous due to the salted fish.
* Any of their Pan Fried Flat Rice Noodle dishes - but sometimes it is a little greasy, so drink plenty of hot tea!
* Crispy Fried Chicken (all day special dine-in only offer for $5.95 each) - that is a very sweet and filling deal!

From 3PM to 5PM, they have a limited \"High Tea\" menu, customers get a free HK style milk tea or coffee (hot or cold) along with your order. Not an awesome promo, but if you have to pay for said complimentary beverage it will cost you $2.50.  

NOTE: In their recent Chinese newspaper ads, they have all day specials from $4.95 to $7.95, but I have never tested that during normal dinner time.

Minimum for credit card use is $15, so order enough or bring cash.

Review #1 of 2014. Checked!"}
{"text":"I ordered my favorites: combination fried rice, sweet and sour chicken, hong king style noodles, salt and pepper pork chops, half duck and shrimp.

The food was delicious. Service wasn't too bad, I didn't have a hard time flagging down our waiter, and they are open until 2am! 

Only thing that gets annoying, is trying to find parking in this little joint."}
{"text":"Easy to find local joint. Parking lot was jammed packed but lucked out and found the one and only spot. Went around 10:30pm on a Monday night and received the after hours menu.. Didn't really even bother looking at the regular menu since there were four pages of choices for $7.95 and under. Salt and pepper pork and chicken with orange peel. Can't beat a $10 meal for two!"}
{"text":"Went here last week, actually ive been here a few times before.  

This is the best chinese restaurant in chinatown hands down.  The food taste so good and the prices are cheap.  The atmosphere is comfortable and they give you decent service.  

If you want authentic chinese food without feeling uncomfortable, this is the place to go.  

The place is clean and well kept and spacious but not empty."}
{"text":"So...the food here is great but the customer service needs a facelift! There are a few people that have been work there for years who need a lesson on two on customer service. Also, the bathrooms always smell terrible. Other than that I think the food is worth it."}
{"text":"Having been relatively unimpressed by this place years ago when I first tried it, it wasn't for several years that I returned.

I stopped by with a friend for dinner as we were starving. We ordered a gluttonous amount of food, expecting to have plenty of leftovers. If the items we tried, there were a few items I enjoyed, but overall, nothing really stood out. My favorite from the meal were the salt & pepper pork chops and the service was surprisingly attentive. 

The food is cheap, but I don't see myself coming back any time soon."}
