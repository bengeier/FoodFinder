{"text":"Have not actually been inside so this will be a review of multiple drive thru experiences, not a 5 because I haven't been inside but I'll do that next time and update my review.

We usually go for chicken tacos, quesadillas (chicken and cheese), patron, AZ, or carne asada burritos. Food is always hot, order always correct.  Food tastes good, not overly salty and definitely bland. It isn't a gourmet meal, but it hits the spot. Prices have gone up a bit but at least they didn't shrink the portions. 

This place stands out for me because no matter how big or 'customized' our order is (e.g. no pico or easy in lettuce, etc.), they've ALWAYS been super patient when taking the order and then super nice when we pick up our food."}
{"text":"Not that any Filiberto's location is high-class, but this Filiberto's is the kind of place where it doesn't matter whether or not the employees spit in my food because either way I'm going to eat my burrito under the assumption that they did."}
{"text":"A halmark of delicious mexican food, if you haven't had it, you owe it to yourself to try try it!!"}
{"text":"We are long time Senior Taco fans and today (against my son's wishes and my better judgment ) we tried this place instead.  What a mistake! I ordered a taco enchilada combo,  my son got the kids meal. Even after explaining to them that my son can not have wheat they included a churro on his plate. He was disappointed as was I.  Very simple instructions... Not able to comply.  I ordered the combo and not asking what kind of meat was included with the enchilada I was disappointed to find no meat at all in the enchilada.  Instead it was a cheese enchilada and a beef taco.  The enchilada sauce is very mediocre and no matter how much of their salsas I added,  there was no flavor to be had.  Advantage:senior taco!  Even the pickled vegetables lack something.  I think it's called flavour.  And No,  I do not work for Senior Taco.  The deep fried taco had a strange flavour about it,  perhaps the fry oil is turning.  It reminded me of burning plastic.  This place is to Mexican food what McDonald's is to American food. A very poor example.  I will avoid it forever.  Fail!"}
{"text":"Quick and friendly service! Great stop for a quick lunch break"}
{"text":"Filberto's serves great tasting authentic Mexican food, great value, big portions and always with a smile. It is family owned and it shows. Manuel Sr, Manuel Jr, Eric and \"Mamacita\" Mrs Victoria are working hard to serve the  Fountain Hills community.  Coming from California I can honestly say Filberto's is as good or better than anything there. Five Stars. Troy Wiseman"}
{"text":"Very disappointed!!! I'm sure anyone that can remember the days gone by when Filibertos truly was the best place to get a carne asada burrito would feel the same.  This place has retained almost none of its former glory.  I must sadly concur with those who have given one and no stars to their once great carne asana burrito. It was pretty much nothing more than over salted meat.  Everything else about the place seems to have also really gone down hill.....this state of affairs is very sad to a once devoted admirer"}
{"text":"I'm here at 9:45 with the sticker saying open till 10pm. And they're closed. And literally the girl behind the counter can see me and is just ignoring me like I don't exist. I knocked for like 30 seconds just to get an answer and she just sat there. Clearly able to hear me because I can hear the kitchen crew talking. And finally when she looked up clearly annoyed with me and I asked why are you guys closed? She just shook her head at me and looked down. The morning crew is usually super nice and awesome. But good lord. Awful. I get if it's super slow and you just want to close early but at least acknowledge someone who's clearly confused as to why 15 full minutes before closing the door is locked while a full crew of workers are still inside."}
{"text":"Fresh and Hot food. 

Not to mention how wonderful the cashier was. She brought the food to us the serving size was generous plus a women forgot her purse and the wonderful atentive cashier hustled it out to the owners truck just before they took off. 

I usually go to the one on 19th Ave but after this night am probably coming here."}
{"text":"Breakfast Burritos before class.
Carne Asada burritos for dinner.

I've never met a burrito that could match this place.  Fresh ingredients, fair price, and fast."}
{"text":"I don't give bad reviews often, but this place deserves it. They completely messed up my order, even though I spoke clearly and they repeated my order to me. I was not happy with their service either. Needless to say I will not be coming back here soon."}
{"text":"I will never eat at this location again.  

Yesterday, I ordered a Carne Asada Burrito with no guacamole and 3 rolled tacos - cheese only at the drive through. The person taking the order verified I wanted no guacamole THREE TIMES only to read my order incorrectly at the window prompting me to remind them there was to be no guacamole.  He then had to run and tell the kitchen staff to correct the order and assured me it would be correct. 

When I got home, I found out that burrito had no pico and was full of guacamole and that the rolled tacos were overlooked and so brittle they could have shattered if thrown against a wall.

This experience will ensure that I never go back to this location and quite possibly the chain.  

Because there are two locations listed in yelp, I am copying this to both."}
{"text":"BEWARE go to another filiberto's they ALWAYS mess up your order then when you call they have no answers. Also they jack up their prices and can't get the order right prices went from about 7 to 8 bucks a plate to 12 to 15 RIDICULOUS. I will never return to pay sit down restaurant prices for pathetic lackluster Mexican food, gross. The one on Main and Sycamore is way better and they have the 5 buck chimichanga plate."}
{"text":"I ate here a couple times cause its close to homr but I rather drive farther for better service. Drive thru take a long time and for what u get lousy food. This place is not what it use to be. I rather go to the ine on 67 and Thomas or mr leno any other filibertos just nit this one"}
{"text":"I'm in love with your food and service . 3 rolled tacos are amazing and dollar Monday is perfect :) always enjoy going there and great service ! Keep it coming ! :)"}
{"text":"I LOVE THIS PLACE. Their food is awesome, and their service is amazing. Lily and her husband run the place exceptionally well, and they are always in the greatest mood. I love their energy, and you can tell they represent their store using it. 

The rolled tacos, refried beans and chicken tacos are my favorite!"}
{"text":"The food is good. But be prepared to get super crappy service! Everytime someone has an attitude and drive thru takes forever.."}
{"text":"Trash....I've been here twice. The guacamole isn't fresh and tastes gross, they charged me more for drinks than what's posted on the menu. When I brought it to the cashier's attention she spoke to the cook who casually brushed it off by telling me the price on the menu is wrong and offered no apology. There are plenty of other Filiberto's in the area that are great but this isn't one of them."}
{"text":"My husband and I have eaten at several Filibertos around the valley. We love Filibertos. This is the ONLY Filibertos that we get sick at every time we eat there! Someone needs to get a health inspector to investigate this restaurant. If you eat there, eat at your own risk because you will be sick all night and feel it the next day like a hangover. To clarify, we're referring to the Filibertos in Buckeye on Miller Rd."}
{"text":"Horrible customer service. After taking my order, I sat at the window for 15 MINUTES, without anyone letting me know why it was taking soooo long for a.....get this......a JR BEAN AND CHEESE BURRITO! When I asked why it took so long, she was rude! I decided to get my money back and spend it elsewhere, Panda! I should've known better after having my first bad experience there, when I found a hair in my burrito! Trying to give them another chance! My bad! Fool me once, shame on you! Fool me twice? I'm outta here!
One star, for making it out alive!"}
{"text":"Where to begin...the interior of the restaurant was filthy dirty, the food was just all-around gross, the counter girl was surly (and seemed to take issue with the fact that I didn't immediately know what I wanted when I walked in), and the trashcan at the front of the restaurant was overflowing with garbage.  Other than the fact that this location is near a light rail stop, and probably gets a fair share of the unique individuals who ride it, the majority of the clientele in this area is from several office buildings that are close by, so I wasn't really sure why it was so third-world inside. Their prices sure aren't: $11 for a soda and a #8 rolled taco combo, smothered with what looked like Linda Blair's split pea soup vomit masquerading as guacamole. I won't be returning - ever - to this or any other Filiberto's."}
{"text":"I've been to this location 3 seperate times and they get our order wrong every time. How hard is it to understand what \"I don't eat beef I want rolled CHICKEN tacos\" means?"}
{"text":"Great location! I've never had a negative experience here, but tonight I had a really nice one. Yadira was my cashier/server and she was FANTASTIC - she gets 5 stars ha ha! She was friendly and seemed happy to be there. I had to add to the order at the window (which has to be annoying) and she was great. Thank you!"}
{"text":"Worst drive thru experience in my whole lifetime. 

 A normal day in my life, it's time for some Fili B's. I'm hungry and love the red and green sauce. I took my order through the drive thru. The lady told me the damage to my wallet and heart. I was like that's not too bad, ok sweet. I then drove up to the window with exact change in my hand. The lady looks at me and asked \"do you need anything?\".. I'm like what? And then she then said \"did you order?\". I was like okay, you just took my order like 1 minute ago and told me my bill. Lady asked \"what did you want?\" I said give me that Wednesday special. She's like okay \"bean burrito\". Few minutes later she asked me if I'd like red or green sauce, I said both of them. Lady then  proceeds to reach over the counter for invisible sauce Lololololol . I get my food and drive 10 miles home. At home I'm going through my bag and there's no fking sauce, like wtf how am I suppose to eat a whole bean burrito plain with no sauce. I didn't even want to drive back, I was already exhausted from my long shift hours at work plus 10 miles for some sauce she had forgotten. Worst experience ever.. lady probably has amnesia or short term memory.

*Beware customers!*
*Watch out for the invisible sauce hand grab!*
*Check your bags and count everything in there!*"}
{"text":"I love getting the bean and cheese burrito. Honestly that's all I get from here. The two times I've been to this location however, it's taken over 15 min to gets through the drive thru. Don't go through unless you have extra time."}
{"text":"I find it interesting that the different locations of this chain of restaurants have different numbers of stars, and I'm wondering if I would like another location more.

One thing that I appreciate about this place is the hours.  The dining room is open until midnight and the drive-thru is 24 hours.  Not too many places in this neighborhood are open that late, so it's nice if you want a late night bite.

The food was OK.  I probably should've tried one or more of the many salsas from the salsa bar, but I like to first try food on its own before adding anything to it, and then I was just feeling to lazy to get up and get some salsas.

I had the two chicken tacos meal.  For some reason, I found the first taco to be more flavorful than the second.  That actually worked out to my benefit because it stopped me from stuffing myself silly.  The rice was pretty standard Mexican rice and the beans were as well, but they were served with a lot of shredded cheese on top... and lots of cheese will make just about anything taste good.

This is the kind of place that I might visit again when I'm feeling like Mexican food, don't feel like traveling too far for it, and don't feel like spending too much on it.  Also a great late night option."}
{"text":"Carnitas burrito was very good but I would have liked something more than a ton of carnitas, guacamole and pico de gallo (like beans, rice, cheese)---just because it ended up being a ton of meat! Oh and the tortilla was so good! Not dry and a little chewy, yummmm!

Chips were also really yummy, kept under a heat lamp so they'll be nice and warm for ya :) 

My dad loved the guava agua frescas. I had a sip, I thought I tasted a spice of some sort, gave it some depth.

Anyway this wasn't the best Mexican meal I've ever had but it was a very good one. Place looked clean and server was nice but she couldn't understand my questions \"what burrito is popular? What type of burrito do people like? What do you like?\" haha oh well, it turned out alright for me :)"}
{"text":"I love filibertos. Been in mesa 8 years and been to many different locations. Do not go to this one. I have been there probably 15 times and the screwed up the order at least half of those. Not exaggerating. Food is just as good as any other. Filibertos,  it you only have about a 50% of getting what you ordered. There is another filibertos near this one at Dobson and main. Never had a bad experience there."}
{"text":"I, personally, love Filiberto's. I have always gotten a bit of a tummy ache, as my boyfriend says \"It sounded like a good idea at the time!\". That being said, this location is  absolutely horrible. Not only do they have incredibly rude staff that takes 15 minutes to get you a bean burrito and a taco, but they are very unsanitary. The only reason I am able to sit at home and type this right now, is because I am being held up from a bad case of food poisoning. I've already stated that I expect to get a tummy ache after eating FiliBs, but this is a completely different story. A doctor confirmed that I had eaten contaminated food, and since FiliB's was the only thing I had eaten, it stands to reason that these guys are running some health violations. I am not giving the entire chain a 1  star, but this specific location deserves less than that. Consider yourself warned."}
{"text":"Can I please have more onions!
The onion slices in each Brito are like giant toenails.  Worst Filiberto's ever!!!"}
{"text":"Good food!!!!!!
Don't go to the chandler and kyrene 
Location 
Go to this one ....,, MUCHO BUENO!"}
{"text":"This is the most disgusting filibertos I've ever been to! Their food is awful! I don't think they even know how to cook. I got a bacon burrito and here we're large chunks of some kind of weird meat. Made me vomit! Plus it did not taste fresh. Such a disappointment!! They didn't even have green salsa....do yourself a favor and never go to this location! they should just close down!"}
{"text":"Nasty! We went there for the 1st time this morning for burritos. The burritos are very small and skinny, the eggs were brownish and tasted rotten, the potatoes were mushy and had no taste, and there was literally 5 shreds of cheese. I bought 5 burritos and everyone in my house took a couple bites and threw them out. Don't bother going there, go a couple miles down to 19th Ave and get Vaqueros...their food is fresh and they give you a lot for the $"}
{"text":"I have been craving Horchata ever since we moved from AZ to NY. If anyone knows any place that serves Horchata as good as Filberto's in New York, suggestions would be appreciated. 

I miss Filberto's A LOT. Their carne asada fries are so good! Portions are huge so it's definitely a belly pleaser. I have to admit, every time we go to Filberto's, I always get carne asada fries because I love it that much an it's so filling. If I ever go back to AZ, I will be trying other things. Based on the other reviews on this place, the burritos are a must try."}
{"text":"By far the most depressing nachos I have ever seen in my life! The serving was 1/4 of what I get at other places.I got more meat in high school and I was a nerd and a loner. It was so flat I thought it was an Asian ass! It seemed like Michelle Obama ate my nachos and I got the left overs. I would show pictures but I finished them by the time i got done writing this review. I was hungry don't judge!  I will never go back to this filibertos again. I'd rather drive 10 miles further to RObertos. I would write more but but I'm gonna go look for some more food."}
{"text":"The quality isn't great, but if you want Mexican and don't have much time, it is better than Taco Bell etc. There seems to be a consistency problem. f you order the same thing meal several times, the meal will be a little different each time. Needs better quality control when it comes to the ingredients being used. Store and furniture are kind of dumpy."}
{"text":"The first time, I went through the drive-through and discovered the speaker/microphone is terrible, and they got my order wrong but the food was delicious. Every time since, I've parked and walked up to the window (the window is open 24 hours) and ordered there, and they've never gotten my order wrong since. (so, pro tip: don't use the drive-through. Walk up to the window.) It's good food that leaves me feeling good -- real Mexican tostadas and tamales like the kind you can only get from authentic Mexican food places like this.

I also discovered tonight that they have REAL Mexican cokes -- you know, the kind that can't be bought at grocery stores in the US. The kind that has good caffeine and REAL cane sugar instead of the American corn syrup crap. They're $2.50/bottle but it's a real nice luxury treat. Mexican coke doesn't leave the sticky feeling in your mouth like corn syrup coke does."}
{"text":"Don't eat at this location. They are slow. So slow. They are rude. And your order will not be right. I have given them several tries and they fail each time. The price is different every time I eat there and get the same stuff. Not going back here."}
{"text":"Went last night and ordered a bean tostada, was given a beef tostada. So my order was wrong, I drove back (luckily I don't live far away) and had them make my order right. But they would not refund the difference in the money I paid, so what's normally a $2.50 tostada bead over $5.00!!! 
Total bs! I'll never leave there again without checking my food and making sure I didn't over pay again!!! Thank god I'm moving soon and will no longer have to visit this location, the staff is rude and unfriendly. I'll probably just hit fredericos as it close enough from now on. 
So one more customer lost!!! 

Only one star, zero if I could!!!!!"}
{"text":"Went to filbertos to eat a late night dinner, ordered rolled tacos and the thursday special 1$ tostadas . Carlos took our order at the window he treated us so good and   Juan cooked some GREAT food. This is the place for some great food and great people who work there. Filbertos we will tell our family and friends that this is the place to come if they want the best mexican food . fast. friendly . and omg goooooood . kathy and denise"}
{"text":"I LOVE Filibertos!  This one is definitely different than any other location that I've been to.  I ordered a lengua burrito and a carne asada burrito and drove home.  When I got home I pulled out what I thought was a children's burrito.  So, I called to tell them that they had my order wrong.  They told me that they were a franchise and their serving sizes were different.  Bottom line is that you get less food for the same price.  Maybe a good idea if you're trying to lose weight maybe?"}
{"text":"Love the carne asada fries! Fast service and order always is right only problem is that when in the drive thru you always have to make sure you get green salsa if you asked for it because they seem to forget."}
{"text":"Came here once, ONLY because Los Beto's across the street was closed.  I drove thru, ordered a Green Chile Pork Burrito, and asked for it enchilada style, which should have meant covered with green sauce as it was a GREEN burrito.  I get home and my burrito was covered with the nastiest red sauce I'd ever tasted.  This clashed big time with the not so good tasting green sauce inside, and I knew right away I wouldn't be able to stomach eating this disgusting combination.  

I grabbed my burrito and my receipt and immediately went back to get a replacement burrito, and this was barely 10 minutes after I'd left there as I live less than 1 mile away.  The lady who I guess was the manager, who also had her mis-behaving young child behind the counter with her, was not willing to replace my food or give me a refund.  She said I had ate some of it and therefore they would not do anything.  I had literally taken 2 small bites just to see if I'd be able to choke it down as I didn't feel like going back out to replace my burrito unless I absolutely had to.  

I went round and round with her, and was finally told to contact the general manager the following Monday.  She wrote his name and phone number on the back of my receipt, and wouldn't you know the number she gave me was incorrect, and the printed number on the receipt was a fax.  So I wasted even more of my time by typing up and faxing a letter to the general manager, but I never received any response and of course no refund to my credit card, and would rather eat sand than eat at this Filiberto's again!!!"}
{"text":"This location is ridiculous. In the time it took to make the food I was able to create this account to leave a review. I ordered two burritos, you would have thought I brought my entire family to eat. They were seen standing there Conversating even after making eye contact with me several times. Two burritos on a modestly busy day should not take over 10 minutes"}
{"text":"LET ME WARN YOU: HORRIBLE CUSTOMER SERVICE. 

I ordered carne asada fries and 5 rolled tacos. All they gave me was 2 little cups of hot sauce (literally, you can only get 2-3 dips from the hot sauce before it's all gone!) and when I asked for a couple more, they refused to give me any and said they have to charge me if I wanted more! HORRIBLE AND STINGY. 

Also, the lady with the red/colored hair has a attitude problem and that is not professional what so ever. 

I've been here multiple times because I thought maybe they're having a bad day, but no, still the same terrible service as the first time."}
{"text":"Always a good choice. The best cheap greasy Mexican food around. Service can be slow and sometimes confusing but c'mon now, this isn't fine dining, deal with it. Would eat those taquitos all day"}
{"text":"Ordered the fish tacos with rice and beans. Bland, awful. Fish was overfried. Beans were not that wonderful smooth creamy texture that refried beans are supposed to be. Won't be going back."}
{"text":"The breakfast burrito was ALL egg. I tried really hard to find the machaca et al buuut just egg. I love breakfast burritos 

The second star is because the cowboy fries weren't bad."}
{"text":"Filbertos is a chain, but unlike many others this location has indoor seating with nice decor.  The food is cheap and good, portions large.
$1.00 tacos on Tuesday which I dare say are comparable to Garcia's tacos.  Massive burritos.  Not a fan of the use of enchilada sauce on the chili rellenos, however. 

In summary, cheap and plenty."}
{"text":"Gross food, dirty location, no salsa bar, and rude employees. Need I say more? All benefit is that they have a drive thru."}
{"text":"Great for late night very unhealthy mexican food. portions are huge. The food is good and the service is always crappy. Carne Asada burrito, super nachos and Horchata are my favorites here, of course not the burrito and nachos at the same time or you would be on the toilet all night."}
{"text":"worst taco salad ever  I ordered this item every time I go this time stale tostado shell no beans to sour cream  no peppers no guacamole no lettuce all I got was tasteless meat  the cook was throwing things around fighting with the cashier . I pass at least three other resturants including one right in my near my home but have always enjoyed your salad  will not return as long as the cook is still there  will try another taco shop . he really  ruined  my day"}
{"text":"A ROACH crawled out of my Carne Asada fries. I spit my food out instantly.  If I am sick tomorrow it's because filibertos....never ever again I go to this place. 0 stars is more deserving."}
{"text":"On my quest to eat cheaply today, I stumbled in at this Filiberto's on Taco Tuesday. Taco's were 1.29 and were good. I ate two of them with the green sauce on the side. Tasty and filled my stomach for cheap. Thanks"}
{"text":"I don't usually have a problem at this location & it's around the corner from my house, but tonight the customer service was certainly sub par. The young man taking my order was fine, however I had a highland high coupon card that the football team sold as a fundraiser and it has 5 buy 1 get 1 free burritos available on it and they refused to accept it. The gentleman said they called the manager (I do believe him) and that the manager said 'they were no longer 'authorized' to accept those coupons. They aren't supposed to expire till sometime in 2018.
Pretty crappy of them to not accept the coupon that was used by the kids to help raise money for their football team."}
{"text":"Two changes have occurred in the past few times that I have been going. One, the food portion has gone down. My taco looked like a flimsy Jack in the Box taco. Also, the enchilada I ordered had cold shredded cheese rolled up in sauce. Two, their prices have gone up. I do not mind paying x amount of dollars for food, but not an increase in price coupled with lower food portions. I won't be going back. In all fairness to Filiberto's, I won't name the better, cheaper mexican food place in town."}
{"text":"My fiancé had a taste for mexican food so I found this place quickly on Yelp. In my hometown I have never had the pleasure of ordering authentic Mexican food at a drive thru. Between the two of us we ordered :
Shrimp,carne asada,  carnitas, and beef tacos. A shredded beef and cheese enchilada & shredded beef chimichanga combos. With the exception of one stale tortilla with the carne asada taco the meal was delicious. I was pleasantly surprised at the quickness and quality of the food. I will definitely eat here again."}
{"text":"I'm new to Chandler. I stopped at the location on W Ray Rd. The food was OK. Before I left, I went to the men's room. The floor was littered with used paper towels, the room appeared disheveled and dirty, and the toilet seat was missing a bolt. If they can't keep the rest room clean and functional, I shudder to think what's happening in the kitchen. I gave it one star because I won't go there, or any Filberto's, again."}
{"text":"I guess I should have looked here first before I stopped off on the way home, but I just spent 8.00 for a meal that was unedible.  I had the number 20 but asked for a chicken enchilada, so had to pay more.  Well I finally opened up the enchilada to see if there was any chicken and there was NONE. There wasn't even any cheese, it was just a rolled up tortilla with sauce on it.  The taco shell was so hard I had to discard it and just eat the meat inside.  To add insult to injury, the food was cold.  I won't be back or eat at any other filibertos.  It really sucked."}
{"text":"Big fan! Very nice people. Great prices and so much food! Love the rolled tacos supreme, loaded nachos and so much more! Check out the daily 99cent special. Had the rolled tacos tonight. 3 rolled tacos with guacamole yum!"}
{"text":"Food is salty, can we just add our own salt because your taste isn't the taste I desire. I really dislike plastic due to it being littered everywhere. Plastic utensils, plastic plates. This will be my last visit here. I wish this experience could've been better, everything tasted canned."}
{"text":"I love Filiberto's, but this is the worst I've had.  The beef tacos I ordered were probably made with old/rancid oil because that's how the tortilla tasted.  Never again at this location!"}
{"text":"Like the food but the girl that works the drive thru had the worst attitude ever I'll never go back to this location."}
{"text":"Filly-B's is an addiction, once you start craving them you have to have them or you'll go crazy. The thing that my mouth waters over the most are the super nachos (a ton of chips with cheese, carne asada, and more all waiting to be devoured! It's probably best to eat these with a fork). My backups are their Arizona burrito (I never remember what's in it besides potatoes, but I love it) and the rolled tacos (but to be honest I've never had rolled tacos at countless Mexican places and I've never been disappointed and I can't say they are anything extra ordinary here).

This location has some added bonuses: hot chips while you wait and you can walk \"next door\" to get a Jamba Juice!"}
{"text":"I live 2 mins away I will come back when my orders wrong and have now 3 times, and today going back did nothing for me. I always get the same thing bacon breakfast with extra bacon and potatoes and that should ensure a bite with bacon every time. And when yall don't put extra bacon on it yall end up making me two burritos to replace the first. I DON'T WANT TWO BURRITOS JUST ONE WITH TWICE THE BACON. If I need to order extra extra bacon I'll start it's not about the price it's about the bacon!! Egg shouldn't be the most used ingredient if I'm asking for extra bacon. Ur too close for me to stop coming but please make my food so I only have to show up once"}
{"text":"Customer service in the drive thru wasn't great but the food was good."}
{"text":"This place isn't bad but it sure wasn't the greatest!  The girl who rang us up looked like she needed a nap and a personality boost.  The meat tasted pretty good but my carne sada fries seemed a little americanized. Still satisfied my craving for mexican food but i wouldn't say for sure i'd ever be coming back."}
{"text":"\"Best Mexican Food in Arizona, California, New Mexico\"? Oh God I hope not. If so, I am so sorry.

I went there the other day with some co-workers and ordered the #17--2 Carne Asada Tacos for $7.77. While I waited for my plate to come out, I helped myself to the self-service chips & salsa bar. The food came out relatively quickly and the portions were quite generous.

I was presented with the typical Mexican plate--tacos, rice, and refried beans. While the carne asada tacos were relatively average, the accompanying rice and beans were absolutely terrible. Honestly...how can you mess up rice and beans? They tasted like they were mixed with cleaning solution.

In retrospect, any place that prides itself as \"Best...\" is a self-delusional ploy at convincing yourself that your canned/frozen goods are better than other places' fresh goods. Methinks not."}
{"text":"Worse place to eat at night. Drive thru is so terrible, they start with a \"yeah\". Then they don't repeat your order and when they give you the food, they flip the box. What the hell. This is my second bad experience and don't with that crappy ass place. South Phoenix is where all the great Mexican spots are anyway."}
{"text":"Look, quit bitching. It's drunk food. I love this spot. The value menu is pretty good, but I love the green sauce from here. The ham breakfast burrito  is the way to go. This place is a Mesa landmark."}
{"text":"Me and my family went to purchase some food on Saturday 24th. When I was ready to pay they charge my card two times. Ive asked to get my money back and the manger Miguel smiled and refused to give my money back even when I had proof of the purchased items.  I asked for the corporate office number and also refused to give me that information. This restaurant stole my money!!! If you decide to eat there beware they charge twice and steal from you. Highly AVOID."}
{"text":"The fast food there is always served hot and fresh. The taste is so good you can't wait till the next bite. The only drawback is the restaurant dining area itself. no frills there. Take out is a best option. Hurry home and dig in."}
{"text":"This place is disgusting! We ordered guacamole and not only did they not send chips, but the guacamole looked like a spread. The steak we ordered was not fresh and tasted like dog food! Please don't let the pictures on Postmates fool you! GROSS!!!!!"}
{"text":"Let me start by saying that we are regulars here. The girl that normally helps us out is always timely, and she is able to get my (rather complicated) order right. Tonight when we went, the drive thru was being ran by a manager, so I expected even better service than usual. Unfortunately, the opposite was true. I ordered my usual- carne asada fries. But I like them without cheese, and they gave them to me with cheese on them. So, I returned to have them fix my order, and it took about 15 minutes for them to remake the fries, and much to my dismay, the fries were disgustingly soggy, and way undercooked. It's unfortunate one of the young girls is better at running the restaurant than the manager.

But, I'm still giving it three stars because even after the many mistakes, I am addicted to their carne asada fries and will probably be back tomorrow. Great food, not always great service."}
{"text":"Absolutely disgusting.  I had enchiladas and a taco, just to give them a chance.  This was the worst mexican food I've ever had.  Waaaaaay too much government tasting cheese on the food, and hardly any meat.  I do have really high standards because I grew up on Tex-Mex but this was just pathetic......"}
{"text":"If you want some real Mexican food, this is the place to go. My favourites are the breakfast and Arizona burrito. Keep in mind that the people who work here don't speak english fluently."}
{"text":"Went through the drive-thru and ordered a burrito. Waited for 10 mins with 2 people in front of me. My burrito was very cold when I got it."}
{"text":"Love this place.   I go there at \"least\" once a week because i am addicted.  Tuesdays tacos are the bomb, drive thru is endless and f u if you cant chew the tasty shell,  you must have bad teeth....I go there every Wednesday for the Chimichanga.  I think they know my car (sea foam Jag) by now I order No beans, No lettuce, No pica  lol.   They are so flexible and the end product is awesome!    They will put whatever you want on the side!   Making me hungry just writing this review.   BTW the meal is so huge for the price I have to cut it up and it makes 3 meals.  Try everything and you can not validate  an opinion on one stop.   Love this place"}
{"text":"Most disgusting Chicken taco ever! Tasted like FISH! Avoid this place!!!"}
{"text":"The best Filibertos in the whole state! Its clean and the employees are pleasant. Clean bathrooms and they maintain a very clean seating area/salsa bar. Texas burrito and a gold peak tea is amazing!"}
{"text":"Took the light rail to Phoenix today and on the way home I had a craving for carne asada ...  so while waiting for my transfer bus to take me the rest of the way home I decided to grab a burrito from this location . It was delicious, not too much pico de gallo, or guacamole, plus the pieces of steak were tender, and there was plenty for lunch tomorrow. I can not complain about the food, or anything, really. The outside tables were clean, and the staff was pleasant and attentive."}
{"text":"As always, food is awesome. But at this location the young lady at the drive through was also a rock star. She brings service with a smile to a whole new level."}
{"text":"Really over 20 minutes in the drive thou with only one car ahead of me .. I know Mexicans are slow but really ....."}
{"text":"I have always liked the food there.better quality  than taco hell the issue is with the terrible service I got in the drive through. es.they have 99 cent tacos.which is the only reason I stopped there on a tuesday.I was greeted rudely
  Literally ya I'll b w u in a min.int a rude tone.it   this was at 1150 pm.well after sitting in silence for 10 15  mins.I was deemed worthy to place my order,4 tacos.when I pulled up to pay,the charged me full price!so I said its \"taco tues.\" 99 cents a piece.to which the rude snot face teen said in a condenscending tone\"uhhh todays wed.which made me question if I had my days wrong.after thinking n checking calendar I realized  it had been wed.for all of 10 minutes.and I had tried to place my order at 1150  but was left waiting to order for 15 mins.when I explained this to worker,he could care less and shrugged.very unprofessional.so I paid  full price for something that should've been half the pice. I wanted to complain to manager but was  in a hurry the douche working there is a lil punk.I suspect he made me wait just so he can act like a douche.(on  a power  trip).I work in a restaraunt n the rule is if you're ready to order,the time u pull up should be counted.not the long time it took to be acknowledged. I will never go here again.I don't need rude service."}
{"text":"usually good for a cheese crisp.....tonight not good....cheese enchiladas not cooked....cheese not melted on top OR inside....waste of 7 bucks"}
{"text":"When it comes to the '-bertos' restaurants there is definitely a wide variety of quality between them all. I put this one square in the middle it's not fabulous but it's by no means one of the worst ones. I'd say it's average to good. When you roll up at noon on a Saturday and you're the only car in the drive thru that says something. The portions from this location are on the small side. An order of carne asada fries is definitely smaller than you'd find at Julioberto's and Los Betos. They do not use real guacamole here it's that weird green guacamole sauce stuff. if you're looking for quick Mexican and you're in the area it'll do."}
{"text":"If you're looking for good, greasy Mexican fast food, you've found the right place. Always good for a late night snack as they are open 24 hours. The Carne Asada Burrito is always good. But if you want a killer dish (as in amazingly yummy AND as in 6 billion calories) get the Carne Asada Fries!!"}
{"text":"When they opened the new Filiberto's on Pecos/McQueen, I was at once ecstatic and dismayed.  Ecstatic because there was a new Filiberto's VERY conveniently located.  Dismayed for the same reason - I knew at once that this location would result in too many visits and the ensuing poundage and cholesterol increase.  I'll admit it:  I'm a devout \"full of gatos\" addict!  My addiction was solidly confirmed the time my sister and I ate there on Christmas morning (back when they were open 24/7/365).

Filiberto's is not just for the drunk.  Oh, don't get me wrong, that 24-hour drive-through lends itself to intoxicated grubbage, as anyone who has sat in the way long 2AM drive-through line can attest.  Filiberto's is a mandatory detour on the way home from a long, beverage-filled evening.  Seriously, the food has magical anti-hangover properties!  But it's also a great place for lunch, take out dinner, and Sunday breakfast/brunch.

The Pecos Road location is in a new building, and is actually quite nice, especially by Fiberto's standards.  There is plenty of seating inside, it's clean, bright, and the decor is pleasant.  A sound system plays light rock (I think it's usually KEZ) at a reasonable level.  Like most fast-food places, you step up to the counter, read the menu posted on the wall, place your order, pay, and then wait for your food.  There is a counter around the corner with self-serve soft drinks, utensils, etc., as well as pickled jalapenos, fresh cucumbers, salsas and menudo garnish.  I usually order, then get some tea and load up a dish of cucumbers while I wait.

The service is quick and efficient.  The people behind the counter are friendly, and when they're not too busy, they'll even bring your food out to you.

Filiberto's food has to be tried to be appreciated.  It's good, solid, kitchen Mexican, served in gigantic quantities.  I can't imagine what the gross margins are at this place, but I'll bet they would cause the average CFO apoplexy.  I don't know how they make any money considering the low prices and the huge portions.

Take the carne asada burrito:  A soft, warm 36\" flour tortilla (but seriously, it's HUGE) stuffed to bursting with tender steak, onions, cheese, salsa and their homemade guacamole.  This thing is as big as my forearm, and only sets me back $4.45!  It's way more than enough for one meal if you're really, really hungry.  Pair it with some rolled tacos - crisply fried corn tortillas wrapped around shredded beef and smothered in cheese and guacamole, and you've got enough for two lunches for a total bill of $8.24 plus tax.  On occasion, I have found the carne asada to be a bit salty, so my alternate choice is the carnitas.  This is the same flour tortilla stuffed with moist shredded pork that's been stewed with tomatoes and onions.  The fish burrito is also excellent.  Filiberto's also serves breakfast all day - I recommend the chorizo and eggs:  Spicy, fatty chorizo with eggs, beans and rice.  It's good for what ails ya!

On Saturdays and Sundays, if you're a menudo fan, this is the spot for you.  The menudo is rich, red and peppery, and is chock-full of fatty, meaty goodness (yeah, yeah, yeah, we all know it's offal, but it's freaking GOOD!).  There is plenty of hominy to round out the dish, and big marrow bones to suck on and enjoy.  Hangover or not, this stuff is great, and a huge bowl is $5.50.  I wish they had it during the week, too!

Yeah, we all know eating at Filiberto's is not the healthiest, but once you've experienced the humongous greasy goodness, you're hooked."}
{"text":"They charged me a dollar more than menu price for a bean burrito. It tasted good, but I do not enjoy being overcharged."}
{"text":"Horrible customer service and prices have gone up. We use to dine here regularly but it's going downhill fast. This last visit in the drive through we asked for brown sauce on the side. We have always asked and they have always given, along with red and green. This employee who later I found out went by Manuel said NO. He said he doesn't want me to get use to them giving us the brown sauce because it's ten feet away in the main part of the filibertos and if he's ever busy(I was the ONLY car in line) he won't be able to get it. I asked then you won't even this one time for a good customer service rating do the right thing? Isn't a drive through all about convenience? So after a few minutes going back and forth and him knowing I have a baby and toddler with no shoes on in the car I grab my food, pull into parking lot grab my kids carry them Inside get my brown sauce and then ask for the manager and they said to just call back later she is gone for at least two weeks and she's not going to care because the owner is Manuel's cousin. I even video taped Manuel and the inside to show how NOT busy they were. Plus they are more expensive now then Rosas down the St which is better anyways!!!"}
{"text":"Large portions, but food doesn't taste good, so none of it is enjoyable. Odd flavor to the rice. Carnitas were not moist chunks of meat..it was shredded, and so dry, that it was like wood shavings. Also, the food was oversalted. And we like salt, but this was almost unbearable. This location is probably one to avoid."}
{"text":"I love it, best customer service great tasting food highly recommended not a very fancy place but food is cheap and good the horchate is wonderful."}
{"text":"Food is good enough to get my Mexican food fix, but forget it if your in a rush. They take forever to get you your food. I stopped going there because of that. Shame on them!"}
{"text":"Wow can't. Post with out giving a star shame on mey will give you Hello. No...no no no. Im latina. This place has horrible food beans are not fresh made lookout way to salty.there sauce gren _red spoiled. Beware careful you might get upset stomach. Or worst food poisioning i did... no stars from me wow.have to rate to postthanx yelp"}
{"text":"The food here is always 5 stars. never been disappointed by Filly Bs, and they're open 24/7 which is rare in the valley. unfortunately, though, the service is very slow and the people are quite rude. literally, the servers don't say thank you, please, you're welcome....basic manners......disappointed"}
{"text":"One of the worst burritos I've ever had in my life. I ordered the taco burrito combo with sour cream on both. No sour cream on the taco and the service was unspectacular. When I first arrived in Tempe it was late and decided McDonald's over this restaurant. Best decision we ever made cause it would have started our new adventure off on the wrong foot. We will not be back!"}
{"text":"Filibertos are individually owned and operated. Food can be different as night and day. Today the Indian School/30th Street site served me barely reheated chili rellenos. They were cold and soggy. Huge disappointment. It was 11:20 am. If they weren't ready, I would have waited for fresh ones. I doubt I will ever be back."}
{"text":"Typical Mexican Fast Food. Prices are on the high side. Food taste and quality is acceptable. Not big on cleanliness or decor on the outside just fast food. Drive thru only."}
{"text":"I will never go to this place again, I would rather drive 10 miles for Mexican food than drive the 100 yards right now to filibertos. I don't understand how a Mexican food place can be out of hot sauce, and they never get an order right. And just fyi hair nets are obviously an option here because hair in your food is a regular find. If by chance they do have hot sauce and ask you how much you need you pretty much just have to say give me what you think I need because they never give you what you asked for in first place. I could go on and on but I think I've said enough about this. The 1 star rating is by default because you can't post a review without a rating."}
{"text":"The worst experience yet, of course unless you are totally drunk or high. The cook and the staff must be on something too. Because even though they look Mexicans they don't know how Mexican food is prepared. Chorizo made with omelet style eggs. Are these people crazy? And instead of fixing the problem, they insist it's \"always\" cooked that way. I hope they close and a \"real\" Mexican restaurant opens there instead."}
{"text":"Food was great. Loved their chimichanga combo plate with chicken. The carne asada was also a big hit. Quick and efficient take out service."}
{"text":"Rude! Rude! Rude! These people are rude and nasty. Saw a roach. Do not eat hear unless you don't care about where your food comes from. The place is nasty and so are the workers."}
{"text":"You can't go wrong with the chile relleno, chicken, or breakfast burritos. I can't believe there isn't a review of this place up yet. The horchata isn't as good as La Tolteca's, but you can't walk to La Tolteca from Palo Verde at 2 in the morning, and it wouldn't even be open anyhow. My 5 stars take into consideration the price (extremely cheap), service (always solid, not exceptional, but generally friendly at a minimum), and cleanliness (may look grubby, but I've never gotten sick). 

I don't think the jukebox works.

The chips with guacamole are decent (they come with a mountain of shredded cheddar) but only if you add some red salsa.

LITTLE KNOWN SECRET ALERT: free chips at lunchtime (could be weekdays only). Do it."}
{"text":"Very comfortable and the staff was great.
I would highly recommend if you just want to sit back and relax and have a drink.  Chef is doing great with the menu and has very high quality standards that you don't usually find in many places.   A++++"}
{"text":"Food is not bad, but they are totally unorganized and never get your order right!!! Check your order before you leave!"}
{"text":"Went through the drive thru @ 9:00 pm and ordered 2 beef tacos and a bean Tostada. The server was pleasant and the food came pretty quickly.

The tacos were very thin meaning very little beef or lettuce, Taste was OK but not great.

The Tostada was better two very crisp shells and beans were OK as well but again not great. Not creamy like I like them and not very hot either.

I got green and red sauce which were pretty standard.

Something disagreed with my digestion and I ended up the next day on the throne all too many times.

Wish it was better as it is close to me and there aren't that many places to choose from in Sun City maybe I will head to El Mirage next time."}
{"text":"I don't know how people can eat here...I guess it's an AZ thing. I had their Cali Burrito & rolled taquitos. 
-Cali burrito: I like that they put lots of guacamole in it, but the meat was bland. As if it had been sitting in water before they cooked it. I stopped eating it because it was starting to gross me out.
-Rolled taquitos: nothing special just plain old rolled taquitos. They were a $1 so I guess that was nice. A little confused as to why people like this place, But hey whatever floats your boat."}
{"text":"Love their cheese enchiladas and rice. I could eat it for dinner twice a week. This one is pretty fast compared to other locations. Food is always great!!!"}
{"text":"The food here is great. I love the steak and egg burritos and any of the breakfast burritos. They are a good size that can fill you up. 

The other food has good portions and is tasty as well.

The thing that concerns me is the prices have gone up a least a dollar for each item since a few months ago. I won't be coming back to this location in the future. 

If the other locations have raised prices I will find other Mexican food to eat.

I ordered a steak burrito and got chorizo. K."}
{"text":"This has now changed ownership and is a JULIOBERTO'S. It  has been for about 6 months. 

You might not have guessed it by looking at the drive-thru menu board because it's the same (as is the phone number) and the sign almost looks the same BUT you can tell a big BIG difference in the taste of food.

I've heard all the stories about all the different  \"-berto\" restaurants being owned by relatives from the same family. I don't know if that's true or not. It would seem that way because all the menus are almost identical. I do know that even if it is true the various \"-bertos chains\" all seem to have their unique recipes which are consistent within their group. For example, I can go to an Eriberto's in one end of town and the hot sauce tastes the same as another Eriberto's located elsewhere but the sauce is totally different from what's served at Humbertos. This particular Filiberto's (when it was a Filiberto's) was the best of all the \"Berto's\" and the best within all the Filibertos...maybe the ingredients were fresher or the cooks took special care to make sure everything was cooked perfectly but whatever it was led me to drive passed 2 other Filiberto's closer to my home just to go to this one.

Now it's gone and it's pointless to make the longer drive because the food is just not good anymore now that it's a Julioberto's. This Berto's will be missed."}
{"text":"This is the WORST filibertos.  I have never had more orders screwed up than this place.  The drive thru is slower than any other Filibertos.  I love Filibertos but this one SUCKS!!!"}
{"text":"big portion with low price. I enjoy the food here and its dine-in is open 24 hours!"}
{"text":"I've been secretly sneaking off to Filibertos for their Breakfast Burritos for about a month.  My wife and I are doing P90X again and we're in competition to see who can loose 40 lbs.  (I'm winning).  The Breakfast Burritos are amazing, by far the best that I've ever had and I recommend them to anyone.  

This specific location is CLEAN!, Fast and always really nice.  

I'm sure that their burritos are really bad if your on a diet but hey, you only live once.  Give-em-a-try."}
{"text":"The Ahwatukee Filibertos location has lost their Edge when it comes to the shredded chicken burrito. It used to be one of my most favorite burritos with the seasoning and the juices tasting so good. Now it's not even shredded it's like they took a boiled piece of chicken cut it up and wrapped it in a tortilla. Super Bland like something you would find in a nursing home. Not sure why they're going this direction but it's very disappointing."}
{"text":"After a long night of homework, and more than a few drinks on Mill, this seemed like a good place to grab some food on the way home. Guess again. I've been to this location before and the service has always been less than ideal. Food isn't bad, but the customer service lacks greatly. The older guy who works later in the evnings should care about what his customers want. Oh, and learn some english, this is America after all.."}
{"text":"Exceptionally clean, well maintained, and beautifully decorated. MTV-'80s music playing overhead (good thing I like it). Employees who waited on me were helpful and super friendly. Food is inexpensive and surprisingly good for being fast food. I frequent another Filiberto's in Sedona, and this one puts that one to shame for its ambience and service. Just wish I could find some napkins around here!"}
{"text":"My roommates and I started going here because they have an awesome salsa bar and the food was fresh. The last few times I've gone, there was this skinny kid working that obviously had a problem with us. I'm super polite to people that are going to handle my food, so I don't know what was up with him. When I picked up my food, he started going off on me about how I think I'm so cool and stuff about hipsters, which nobody would ever take me for one. I sent a message to FiliB's website, because I felt bad for this kid, he seems like he's on the path towards shooting the place up, definitely shouldn't have him helping customers :-/

So I hadn't been in for a few months, decided to try tonight. Crazy kid wasn't working but the staff all acted irritated to help anyone, not only us. This place used to be busy and it was dead. I heard my food get called and when I went up there, there wasn't a soul at the counter, just my bag. The food was nasty and I feel gross, it tastes like everyone took a turn throwing salt in the food. I'm definitely never going back there again, nor anyone I know, I'll make sure of it. 

I'll never understand why restaurants are rude to people if they want to stay open..."}
{"text":"We love fili B's!! This location just never seems to have there business running smoothly. Ordered bean burrito one day with no cheese, I get cheese. I'm try it again chicken burrito I get beef! Everytime they mess up, I have to inconveniently go out of my way and drive back to get refund. These guys make it tonight for me because I grew up loving them! Won't go back to this location!"}
{"text":"Food here is so nasty I rather goo to ROLIBERTOS MEXICAN
FOOOD ON 35AVE UNION HILLS they also have their tueasday 'wensday
Tacos for 99 cents there so yummyy more beef"}
{"text":"The worst place in Arizona I have been to is this filibertos in Laveen. The Mexican lady was very rude. She stoled a dollar from me. When I complained she threatened me."}
{"text":"Nasty place...won't go back!!! I ordered 6 Chicken Tacos and told the dumb lady in drive thru three times what I wanted. Her English was so bad that I couldn't understand what she was said back to me. The bottom of the foam container was saturated in oil, flimsy tacos heated in microwave were greasy and lettuce dried out. I found a small piece of thin hair floating in grease, I assume it came from one of the tacos. I feel like my tongue has a metallic substance that won't go away. I called to complain and spoke to the manager about the service and my order. She suggested I return with my receipt. Not going to happen since I live 3 miles away. She stated my order was not oily since they only heat their food. Little does she know, there was a burnt hole from heating where grease had seeped out! Stay clear from this location and go to Amado's!!!"}
{"text":"Cold food. Look at the refried beans. Never seen anything like this. Not even good. My burrito, shall I just call it tortilla... because it hardly has any meat. If you want Filiberto's just go to the one in Ray. It's just about 2-3 minutes away from here. Bathrooms are clean though so a gave it a two stars."}
{"text":"Perfect place for some Mexican food late at night when everyone else is closed. While it's a bit greasy, it's very tasty nonetheless. Nothing too fancy, just some good, fast Mexican food."}
{"text":"This place used to be good or atleast as good as the rest of the Filibertos I have been to.  Recently in the last few years, the place has become run down, the staff is often mean and disrepectful, and their food is not to par with other locations.  I have never seen such a pile of crap Filibertos in my life and that says alot!  I just got extremely ill after my last meal there, the worst stomache ache I have ever had, this after being treated like crap by their employee when ordering.  I will not be going back to this location again!  May as well close this location FiliB's!   It is a ghost town most of the time and now I know why."}
{"text":"Food tastes good, nice an polite, quick service and have a nice sized side bar for your extras."}
{"text":"The food was sooooooooo good!!! i just moved to Arizona and OMG YESSSS"}
{"text":"Ok, I do not typically leave negative reviews. If I don't like something, I just ignore it, I understand the problems poor yelp reviews cause businesses. BUT, oh my god, after sitting for 15 minutes in Filiberto's drive through waiting for two tacos with just one other car, it was finally my turn to pull up to the window. Moments after pulling up I saw multiple huge cockroaches climbing all around the take out window. This led to a brief moment of bliss as the cashier lady and I stared at each other in silence, both looking for the right words to say, but nothing came out. I finally blurted, \"i'm sorry, but i can't\", and I drove away without my tacos. Please don't eat here people, if you get scabies don't say I didn't warn you."}
{"text":"Very good breakfast burritos served all day. The younger girl who takes your order both inside as well as the drive thru, however, isn't very pleasant. Also, every time I ask them to add something like jalapeños to one burrito, they always get confused and either add them to both(if I'm picking up food for my boyfriend and myself) or not at all. 
The drive thru is not very fast because everything is pretty much fresh but it's usually worth the wait."}
{"text":"It's all good, every time. Try the Carne Asada fries. It is a box stuffed with generous amonts of tasty steak, crispy fries, sour cream, and covered in shredded cheese. Get the guacomole on the side, they give you a bucket haha. How can you go wrong? Well maybe by ordering lengua or cabeza. ;)"}
{"text":"I ordered a adovado burrito and it tasted like GARBAGE.  Do they not care? jesus christ it was horrible."}
{"text":"Carne Asada fries! Bomb. Hold the guacamole though. Churros plain hit the spot. But highly disappointed by no red fanta!"}
{"text":"The food is wack AF.... came with 2 other people... 2 out of 3 plates tasted like doodoo, and the fountain drinks have a weird taste .... the service was mediocre...."}
{"text":"The food is good but I don't think they have ever gotten my order right the first and even sometimes the second time."}
{"text":"Fantastic Mexican food, served 24 hours a day (including breakfast)...this place is great! My girlfriend introduced me to \"Fili B's\" in Mesa a year ago, and since it opened we've hit this 7th Avenue location 3-4 times a week. The staff at the drive-thru are very friendly and efficient, and the food is always fresh and hot (and of course delicious). Their breakfast burritos are my favorite - for less than $5 you're getting a burrito as big as your forearm, a delicious tortilla packed with scrambled eggs, cheese, and whatever else you want in it. My girlfriend's favorite isn't actually on the menu, but when we ask for refried beans and egg and cheese the staff always get it right and never seem confused by the custom order. We've also ordered taco plates and quesadillas to go, both with wonderful results. Also, if you've had good green salsa before, try the green salsa from this location - you'll love it too! :)"}
{"text":"Didn't expect much and was pleasantly surprised! Shredded beef tacos and bean tostadas were great! Will be back."}
{"text":"I love this place. They make everything fresh every day and you can tell.
 When they first opened I ate there 3 to 4 times a week for months and I got the belly to show it. I had to cut down to once a week now but I want to go more.
Great food and big portions at a great price."}
{"text":"I have eaten at Filibeto's all over the valley.  This location is my favorite.  It is clean and the staff is very nice.  I would recommend the Arizona burrito for lunch and dinner and the chorizo special burrito for breakfast."}
{"text":"Great Service. Awesome Food. Wish they had these restaurants in Idaho!"}
{"text":"Finally we have found a place that serves GOOD Mexican food. I had the chicken tacos & my wife had the rolled tacos, both dishes were very generous with the beans and rice. Our daughter had a quesadilla that was almost as big as her, we will be back soon."}
{"text":"Definately the place to go if you love the taste of mexican food that tastes just like home and fast. When ever im in town, I have to stop by.  I just had their Omelet and it was more than enough.  I definately recommend."}
{"text":"This is the stingiest location I have ever been to. I always order super nachos with no carne. The one in Gilbert told me to order Chips with Guac and add the beans, sour cream and Pico. It is $5 less that way. There is no reason to pay for the meat if I am not going to eat it. This location refuses to do it that way. So I get it in the side now and use it for omelette sin the morning. On top of the the portion size is half the size of other locations. I really hope they get new owners soon!"}
{"text":"I liked the other one on Thomas and though the building is a bit smaller I think it helps because the service is quicker. Another thing I think is cool is you can see the kitchen which is comforting knowing the food of all the Bertos places.  Waitress is still nice even with all the grubhub people coming in there lol."}
{"text":"Worst customer service I've ever received. First of all, across all locations I've ever been to the drive thru attendant never confirms what you've ordered and what your total is, that's just lazy. Never has it been a such a problem until my recent visit when the drive thru attendant put our order in with over twice the amount of food we had ordered! My wife and I thought we must have misheard the man at the window saying the total is nearly 50 dollars and handed the card but stayed to look at the receipt and see what was going on. After bringing this to the employee's attention he flat out refused to believe he did anything wrong and would not amend the order to reflect what we asked for. Instead he brings the cook  to the window and they both persist that the order is correct. At this point point I tell them if they're not going to amend the order I need a full refund because we did not order this much and will not be paying for it. They refused to provide any refund at first and I would have to come in in the morning to speak to a manager. My wife joins me at the window to see what's taking so long and they continue to try and get rid of us, she kindly reminds them all we need is a refund and we're out of here. This is when the cook begins yelling about how he made so much food and now it has to go in trash and cussing in Spanish calling my wife a bitch. The both of us manage restaurants and never would either of resort to this level of unprofessionalism, we're convinced the two employees are running a scam utilizing the lack of supervision, deliberate \"mistakes\" in their POS system, and full reign of the registers to try and not only screw customers over but also the company they represent.

Avoid the night shift at this location at all costs."}
{"text":"Always friendly. Great food! Great atmosphere! The Carnage Asada quesdilla is always full of meat and cheese."}
{"text":"Food was fresh and fast. Dining area was dark and lifeless."}
{"text":"They don't have the best staff like they used to and the food is about the same. Drive-thru takes 4-6 minutes. In and Out has better service."}
{"text":"I agree with the first review. I grew up in Arizona and this is by far the best Fillibertos. I guess some of the Filli B's in AZ charge for the extra condiments. At this location you can help yourself to free chips, salsas and other sides. 

This place is your best bet for late night authentic fast Mexican fast food."}
{"text":"cheese never melted, service sucks ..its close thats why i would go there....so i went for a carne asada quesadilla ..so it looked like they threw the meat in the middle of the quesadilla like it didnt matter all the meat thrown in the middle for 8 bucks it better be good....nooooo...so fuck them i got my money back and never went back they didnt offer to fix it or anything ..

melt your cheeses filibertos wtf that dosent taste good .your carne is dry nd skimpy ...."}
{"text":"This is the worst Filibertos ever!!!  This is the closest one to my house and I normally avoid it unless I'm really in a hurry.  Their burritos are smaller than any other Filibertos in the state.  The drive-thru makes the DMV look like a model of efficiency.  Tonight I ordered rolled tacos, and when I got home I was disappointed.  I will drive further away to the one on McQueen and Elliot because this one sucks...  I opened a Yelp account just to warn others.  Keep driving people!!!"}
{"text":"Food is really bad, worst food I can't even call it mexican food it's so bad. Had the Carne asada fries, had no seasoning on it, meat tasted like it was microwaved, the fries was like it was also microwaved it was crap. Taco bell would of been better. Second time different location won't be going to any of them again waisted almost $10"}
{"text":"I was impressed with the xuatomwr service when i walked in. They have a little QT flavor going on. Gteeted with a smile and hello at the door. I like that. Had carne asada fries. Can honestly say that I've had FAR better! These were dry and sloppy looking with those skinny fries and just not good. If I had more than a 30-minute lunch I would have taken them back and ask for a refund. If I come back it won't be for that."}
{"text":"This place sucks.   I've been screwed too many times here not to say something.   I order the green chili burrito at most of the -berto named places.  This location fills the tortilla with 80% rice and 20% green chili to save on their costs. I've complained time and again but suddenly they don't understand English well enough to help.  Rip-off!  I order a bean burrito with cheese and am charged $1.20 extra for a sprinkling of orange cheese. Ridiculous. The place is dirty, run-down and is very slow.  I won't be back to this sh*t-hole."}
{"text":"I felt horrible after eating my carne asada burrito here last time. Being in a gas station isn't what bothered me. For about $1.50 more chipotle is right across the street. Not worth it to me for what they charge for burritoes, especially compared to the nearby chipotle. Even the mcdonalds nearby is still doing business though, so I guess that needs to be considered too. Could be much better, and could be worse too I guess. Definitely better alternatives nearby with more reasonable pricing that serve higher quality food."}
{"text":"If an option to give 0 stars was available, I'd select it!!!! Horrible Horrible Horrible!! Ordered Carne Fries ($9 plate) and they gave me more cheese than Carne Asada!!! REALLY??? Also ordered a Arizona Burrito and they gave me a kid size portion! So upset!! Gave them a call and ask for a manager and this dude goes \"How can i help you?\" After explaining, he passes the phone to some lady that I can not understand at all whatsoever!!!! All i understood was her saying thats there portion size. I will be driving back to the store first thing tomorrow morning to get an address of where I can formally address my complaint and let them know how horrible they ended my night!! After this I think I will be sticking with Senor Taco and paying an extra $1 or $2 for an entree/burrito. \"Don't be fooled, there is 1.. only 1!\" What a joke!!! Save your money customers. Let this place close out!"}
{"text":"Went there last week and there was a qtip in the carna fries. Gross!!!!! Went to the sports grill side and got seated then 5min later had me move seats to another table even after we got our food, Very Rude!!!!!! Plus it's suppose to be a bar at night but they have kids in there till past 10:30, very inappropriate and uncomfortable, especially if your going to drink!!!! Who wants to drink and dance in front if kids? I might as well just stayed home. The food is over priced and it's small inside. I prefer native New Yorker!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"What can I say, they are consitent. I came by this morning for another another steak and egg breakfast burrito, it's good and the green sauce made it great. So nice to have one close to home now, that could be dangerous. ;)"}
{"text":"I liked the fish tacos I got. Also got 2 beef taco combo with rice and beans. They also messed up and gave me a 2 cheese enchilada combo with my takeout. Didn't really care for flavor of shredded beef with beef tacos, won't get those next time.  Cheese enchiladas I ate the next day, not bad but not my cup of tea.  Nice guy at counter taking order/cash.  I gave them a 2 stars cause if 2 not likes, could have been my order that missed the 2 cheese enchiladas. Wish I could give more... Maybe next time."}
{"text":"Ordered way too much food. I had the number 10 which was two chicken tacos with a side of rice and beans. Sounded like something I can easily handle... Not even close! The chicken tacos are so full of yummy chicken I was full after only having one but I couldn't resist the second one... The rice and beans were very bland, so it's okay that I didn't have much room for them. Next time I will stay away from the meals and just stick with the tacos. 
As for the employees they did their business getting our food fast and clean tables I have no complaints. Very yummy and hope to be eating there again soon."}
{"text":"So on another Friday in Lent I find myself looking for fish tacos. I indecisively drove around and came across this drive thru. I think, why not and order 3 fish tacos. It was one of the best food accidents I could find. Big pieces of fish in the huge tacos. Let me start by saying I'm a big kid and I only had 2 of the 3 tacos for dinner. The 3rd was 'breakfast' on Saturday. Would I come back- for fish tacos YES. Their breakfast burritos are pretty good too, but I'll review those in another review."}
{"text":"This location as Scott F. noted was `the go to` location.  Emphasis on the `WAS`.  You could always count on fresh tasty food late night and early morn, when nothing else of quality was open.  Well not anymore.  Ordered a Bacon and Egg Breakfast Burrito, got it home and it had runny undercooked eggs and mystery meat(not Bacon).  The end result:  Lets just say 2 hours later Montezuma and his revenge are alive and well.  Stayed away for a month and went back one late evening recently.  Well the quality has \"plummeted\" and stayed at a culinary low.  The Churros were old and dry. The Fajita Extreme Burrito fell apart at one end after the second bite. Of course it was the opposite end from which I was eating.  The Fish Taco had old dried up cabbage, you know the kind that sits around in the `fridge and gradually looses it's color before mold sets in and the fish patty was burned beyond recognition. The Burn Unit at St. Joe's  Medical Center wouldn't have touched it.  It was inedible.  It looked like it sat at the bottom of the fryer since Montezuma physically roamed the earth.  How a cook/chef could serve something like this to customers is beyond me.  Went to their website and filled out a comment survey.  To date there has been no response. Hence this present review."}
{"text":"When I'm craving dirt cheap, decent mexican food late at night (or what some may say early in the morning), I think of Fili B's. Their ham and egg breakfast burrito is by far the best breakfast burrito in town. Oh my gravy, it's the bomb. Ham, cheese, egg, pico de gallo, all wrapped in a delicious tortilla. Their bean and cheese burrito is tasty too! Not a fan of their rolled tacos. All seem to be more taco than meat. Carne asada fries are deliciously deadly too! Will always be on my list of places."}
{"text":"I love it, I love the Mexican Food!!! , I know that it is very busy , but I loved the menu of variety of Mexican food. I LOVE IT!!!"}
{"text":"Food was great and cheap. love the salsa bar they have they have many different salsas to choose from. I will be coming back again for more great food."}
{"text":"The best Mexican food I've had in Tempe that's open all night long. This food is actually mind blowing. Be sure to try filis chicken salad and two chicken tacos. DELICIOUS! Also, the same woman is there all the time and she's always very sweet!"}
{"text":"Talk about integrity!  While ordering lunch on 10-12-2014 at 2:38pm, at Filibertos 17224 N 19th Ave, Phx., Az... I dropped over $200.00 cash on the floor without knowing it.  Fortunately Veronica Monrroy was hard at work cleaning the floors.  She found the money and brought it to me.  This is a fine example of integrity, honesty and good business.  Veronica Monrroy is also friendly and gracious in her work ethic as is exemplified by her kindness.  Not only is the food great and other employee professional and friendly, it is a clean well keep restaurant.  A customer and referral for life. Rick Melville"}
{"text":"If you're wanting quality better than taco bell, but not as much as a sit down restaurant, this is your place! Their food is great! Love their burritos and carne asada fries (not a huge fan of their tortas though...). They get your order fast and it taste great, never doing taco bell again."}
{"text":"Used to love this place until I got an entire eggshell in my burrito (different location)... then I eventually loved it again until late I got a bunch of soft plastic in my burrito  (this location). Even wrote to them online and never heard back."}
{"text":"I love Filiberto's. I wish there was one back home. We sometimes eat at Filiberto's multiple times when we travel to Phoenix. I wish they still had stickers."}
{"text":"Great place for burritos.  Tacos were good.  Have not tried the enchiladas.  Been to many of the stores about 20 times.  Love the salsa.  Would like to see one more added with increased heat.  I.e. Picante with some habanero."}
{"text":"I have always considered this a cheesy restaurant (no pun intended) but after eating at their dine-in on Indian Bend road, I was pleasantly surprised!  Great extras and great food!  Open 24 hours a day is pretty cool.  
On a side note I think the mall owners are going overboard on inexpensive Mexican dines... Taco Bell, Filbertos, and now Chipolte and on the same corner.  Poor planning and a little unfair to the restaurants!"}
{"text":"Taco Tuesday is a smoking deal the Cook is very nice great music playing in the background ."}
{"text":"1 dollar taco Tuesday is the best!   15 dollars and I have fed my hungry herd of boys.  

No complaints."}
{"text":"Horrible food! I ordered a sausage breakfast burrito this morning. It was bland and tasteless. Then as I'm chewing it started crunching. I spit out the bite and there was a large piece of egg shell in that bite. I looked in the burrito and there was lots more egg shell. I'm not talking about a tiny piece of egg shell. That would have been understandable. This was at least a third of one egg shell. Complete lack of quality and I will not return to Filiberto's."}
{"text":"It pains me to rate a Filibertos anything less than 5 stars, but this particular location just sucks. Today, for example, I got the Monday 3 Rolled Tacos with Cheese special and when I got the food home, there was hardly any cheese on them at all. Anyone who has EVER has Fili's rolled tacos knows that they're usually piled high with cheese. Then the red sauce was literally flavorless red water. What the?!?! I have never seen anything like it before in my life. 

I won't go to this location again. I will definitely go a few miles out of my way and hit the new Filibertos on 35th & Southern instead...THEY are the real Filibertos we all know and love!"}
{"text":"I love me some Filiberto's, and this brand new location to the Laveen area is outstanding. I normally stop by on my way home from work late at night and the food is always hot and fresh. The workers at the drive thru are always friendly and knowledgeable. I appreciate that. 

I'm very excited to see this brand new building pop up in the parking lot of the old Mervyn's plaza. Many residents of Laveen wondered if that plaza would ever rebound after the recession...so glad it has!"}
{"text":"First of all the pavilions is just not a good place to eat. Ive experienced horrible service like at 5 & diner for having hair inside my hamburger and still had to pay, Taco bell for serving me a wrong order, and now filibertos for their greasy quesadillas.. Last night, I got off work at TSR and wanted food to go, so chose fillys. The guy who had night shift was pleasant and kind but the quesadilla was a mess!. In order to see what I was talking about, I posted a couple pictures"}
{"text":"This place just recently opened in Scottsdale and I got the mini chimi which were really good."}
{"text":"very clean, deliscious food, extremely friendly!!"}
{"text":"Great food, best burritos and the service was magnificent!  5 stars all the way. Great Job, cant wait to go again"}
{"text":"Went there with a friend to get bean and cheese burritos. Thank god I didn't get anything with meat because the kitchen didn't look too promising. The burritos were completely lackluster and there was some weird man standing outside the window staring at me half the time (he actually came inside the building and started asking me for food!!!) which was extremely uncomfortable for both of us. Definitely not as good as other Filibertos (this one isn't even listed on the real Filiberto's coupons) and not worth the trip. There are tons of good Mexican restaurants around this area so don't bother wasting your money here."}
{"text":"My friends and I came here because it was one of the few late night places to eat. We all got food poisoning."}
{"text":"Unfortunately it has come to this. I love filibertos but they have broken my heart at this location. I came here every few days for almost two years. My friends and i used to spend over a 100 dollars a week here at one point and I cant let it be stuffed under the rug anymore.
This location has become one of the worst locations when it comes to customer service and food quality. First off, at my defense I am a foodie. Portions are my thing and filibertos fulfilled that thing until now. Burritos became smaller with content wrapped in excess tortilla, chips and salsa i ordered were stale and the salsa was watery. Potatoes in my AZ burrito were uncooked, almost as if raw. As a regular who sees the same cook and cashier every night for 3+ years I still have not been treated with appropiate customer service or greeted as a returning customer even when I come back twice in one day. Bottom line, Since it has opened it has digressed. Completely disappointed when I absolutely love this place."}
{"text":"This place said it was under new management. I decided to give it a shot. While the food was good the service was absolutely horrid. I had to wait over 20 mins for my food with no explanation. I would go to a different branch."}
{"text":"I was super excited because I just moved to this side of town and couldn't wait to try this location. Got an order of super nachos to go, got home, started eating and immediately stopped when I bit into something hard. When I took it out of my mouth to see what it was, I was absolutely disgusted and instantly puked. It was a chewed off finger nail inside of my nachos. I could not believe it. If I could give 0 stars, I absolutely would. Never again will I be stopping here. This may have been a fluke but that's completely unacceptable on any level."}
{"text":"Whoa!  And the prices have gone up too!!!  It's good food but $7 for a carne asada burrito seems steep, no?"}
{"text":"Will try not to eat here unless I am drunk. Greasiest tortillas I've ever eaten. The location off Guadalupe and Mcclintock is much tastier."}
{"text":"I normally go on Wednesdays for cheap bean burritos. I typically go to the location by my work. Their burritos are double the size of a Taco Bell burrito, one and I am stuffed. However, yesterday I went to this location and got bean burritos for dinner. They were too small! The same size as a Taco Bell burrito. Booooooo! Please make your bean burritos bigger!"}
{"text":"I don't like beans and they put beans on my food when I had said no beans. Meat is low quality and served cold. The guy in the back has a bad temper, bad attitude and doesn't know how to treat customers."}
{"text":"This is the only Filiberto's that I will go to .. I absolutely love Katie. They are honest and friendly . And if I want something added they don't over price me ! Even the kitchen staff smile if you smile back !! Worth walking in and enjoying the visit !"}
{"text":"This place looks pretty rundown. It does have a 24 hour drive thru which is a plus. The food was pretty basic, not too expensive. The styrofoam container they gave me the food in had melted parts on the bottom of the container which means there's a strong chance they microwaved the container. The tacos themselves were pretty generic but the microwave part kills it for me."}
{"text":"I arrived with my brother and friend, hungry, and ready to order. After waiting for half an hour, we decided to leave due to the fact that the two men working ignored the complete fuck out of us. We addressed them once for help, and realized they ignored us. Maybe at an attempt to avoid working. Nice job guys."}
{"text":"When in need of street tacos and don't want to drive to south Phoenix... you guessed it! Alfonso's is the place to be! 
Authentic salsas to chose from and you won't regret the choice you've made"}
{"text":"Went here for the first time and was amazed at how great it was. The food and drinks were fantastic along with great customer service. Also thought it was going to be a dive bar of sorts based on the looks of the outside from the street, yet its nice and clean, highly recommend if you are in the area."}
{"text":"ABSOUTLEY DUSGUSTING! Ordered a bean and cheese burrito , it was super cold inside , the cheese was super hard and not melted. The beans were definitely old and stale. I completely lost my appetite and to be honest that was my last trip to Filibertos.  I would have gone up and asked for another burrito but was afraid they would have spit in my food from the last experience I had here. I came one night around 10:30 pm and there was two chairs blocking the drive thru which was really strange, this filibertos is supposed to be a 24/7 drive thru. I decided to go in considering the open sign was on, but the doors were locked, I look inside the cooks and employees are eating and jamming out to music. I banged on the doors a couple times trying to get there attention, they looked right at me and completely ignored me, I was waving at them and asking through the door are you guys open, and no answer they just kept dancing and laughed right at us.  Will never go here again"}
{"text":"I just finished the smallest burrito I have ever had at any filibertos!! filibertos must have forgotten what made it possible to open a location on ever corner, big burritos!!! I will not be back."}
{"text":"When visiting this particular restaurant, I'm sure none of us expect excellence in terms of food or service... But I must say, this specific location's absence of customer service (actually, just general politeness and listening skills altogether) was quite noteworthy.  It was our first time at this location tonight and the individual working there had a terrible attitude, screwed up our order on many different levels and didn't give us any green salsa (which, everyone knows is the only one that matters!!).  Oh but he did give us a free plastic fork (we ordered a burrito and rolled tacos...) and for that, one star seems appropriate."}
{"text":"This USED to be my favorite Filibertos.

I've had quite a few bad experiences with this one. And today is the last time I'll ever go here.

I went around 3 pm. And it was extremely hot in there. I ordered my food, I said 3 jr. quesadillas. And the guy who barley speaks English charges me for 1. I had to ask my boyfriend to ask for 2 more because the guy didn't look me in the eye whatsoever. and I just couldn't stand the fact that I had to repeat myself, when I clearly said what I wanted.

I went to the salsa bar to get my green sauce that I love so much. And guess what. It wasn't over there.... So when our food came out, I asked for some and over course the guy didn't understand me. He ended up only giving me four sauces(2 green and 2 red). And I love spicy food, so I wanted like twice as many as he gave me. So of course they're annoyed when you ask for more.

Then I sit down to eat my food, and our quesadillas are really burnt.. YUM!
To top it off, the sauces were warm, like 90 degrees and tasted bad. Like sour almost. In the past when they were in the actual salsa bar, they've been the same way. It's obviously not refrigerated. (Someone please call the health department.)

I couldn't enjoy my food at all. Oh well.

I just know I'll go to the one on 83rd ave and Thunderbird next time."}
{"text":"the standard metro-phoenix fast-food taqueria, although this location has been known to have a \"girls gone wild\" element to it during certain times of day - due to its proximity to ASU. if I'm drunk and craving this genre, I personally prefer Texano's (a hundred feet west on the other side of the light rail tracks), but this spot is a little cheaper. Go with the Arizona Burrito (or the California at Texano's)... a giant flour tortilla stuffed with carne asada, cheddar, pico de gallo, and curiously, french fries. Just incredible. and stay away from the combos, which are basically just styrofoam containers filled with canned refried beans and day-old rice. Wash it down with a Horchata, then get to bed."}
{"text":"ahhh Filibertos (also known to our circle lovingly as Filiperros), what can i say about Fili's that has not been said already. This by far has been the nicest of the bunch. very clean and friendly staff. Food is OK what can you expect from Filiberto's its cheap food man. Its not Shea Filibertos on the sign. I Used to go to the one on Broadway in Tempe after hitting the bars, sometimes the most eventful part of the night was the Filibertos drive-through on broadway. seen several bumper thumps and several fights because of the fender benders at the drive-through.. ohhh Fili's drive-through and drunkass ppl.. thanks for the memories.. 
Oh yeah, so the food is cheap and decent.. - The End"}
{"text":"Had to show my friends this place just to prove to them there is a filly-B's where you can eat on the table without worrying about diseases.  Nice staff, salsa bar, and delicious, cheap, filling mexican food (everything you look for in a FillyB's).  All Phoenicians know FillyB's are big time hit or miss and this one is a home run.  When I get if it 4 stars keep in mind I am comparing it to other fast food mexican stands.  with that in mind, it would get a 5 except that it isn't 24/7 which is half the appeal of any establishment that has erto's on the end of it.  Just in case you were expecting a greasy drunk meal tell you DD to save his gas because it won't be open at 3 AM like you'd expect."}
{"text":"If I could give negative stars I would.  Just ate here this morning and we found a long piece of plastic in our breakfast burrito.  Took the plastic to complain and was told we can make you another burrito.  Wow, not even give me my money back?!?  Instead another burrito and maybe take a chance on finding another surprise in it!  No thanks."}
{"text":"First of all there's trash all over this place it's empty there's no customers zero and they don't even wipe their tables anyways I order two burritos, we waited over 20min to get them once they call my number the lady says ohh there's only one burrito cause that's all I charged you for , ok I thought you know accidents happen she didn't even bother asking me anything if I still wanted it or anything til right now I'm sitting here and she hasn't bother asking if everything is ok! Horrible customer service never coming back here again."}
{"text":"Ground beef tacos are awesome. Love the salsa bar. Only thing I would recommend is that they tell you want your # is after you pay.  Gets a little confusing trying to figure out if your order is ready or not. But the service is fast and friendly."}
{"text":"was there thursday 6/29, witnessed the lady in front of me in drive through harassed by sleazeball drug addict pounding on her car begging for money, lady drove off, as i pulled up and paid for my order same looser drug addict trailer trash pounded on my  vehicle hood asking for money- i raised hell and scared him off- almost had to display firearm- lady attendant didn't seem to care as i bitched at her asking why this is allowed- no response- last time ever at this mismanaged crackhead/bum/looser/trailer trash hangout - i was a good customer - never again-   they cater to the drug addict panhandling crowd and welcome their aggressive panhandling"}
{"text":"Are graveyard shifts that lazy? Ordered a fish taco, got the fish, the cabbage, two tiny pieces of tomato (at first I thought they were ham), no onion, etc I'm so disappointed. Maybe they were just being racist to me because I'm not Mexican. Usually other nights when I come in, my order is up to par. But I am so disappointed. I'll never come here again even if I starve and drink my urine."}
{"text":"Slowest and rudest drive thru I've ever dealt with. Straight up garbage service. Waited for 45 minutes in the drive thru for a quesadilla."}
{"text":"I go to Fili's for everything. It was the first and last thing I got every time I had to go to and come home from Iraq. It's the small things that matter."}
{"text":"I love how they give you coupons with almost every order.
I always get their bean burritos, mmmmm mmmm:)
They have the salsa bar, with cucumbers, green sauce, red sauce and jalapenos.
I find the service to be okay, I don't expect them to be amazing or anything.
But when I go through the drive through, I can tell they get kind of annoyed when I ask for extra sauce, but oh well.

If you want cheap mexican food, go here."}
{"text":"So sad...this place keeps getting worst every time.  All the food is saggy and over flowing with grease. And if you complain they give you an attitude. Over and over I keep getting my orders wrong and by the time I get home with the food I am just too disappointed to go back.  Called a couple of times and they don't care.  Yes I keep going back because it's the only Mexican food place in buckeye open 24 hrs...but I won't be back.
Can't wait for the one in Watson Rd. To open. Federico's let's see how your food is..."}
{"text":"Food  is really good but they are stingy with their sauces the staff is a little on the rude side"}
{"text":"My husband worships this place. Best shredded beef hard taco. Dripping with grease but so so tasty!"}
{"text":"The food is fantastic!This is my favorite Fili B's! The food is good and the sauces are good. It's my go to comfort food joint, whether it's a midnight burro run or taco Tuesday, I get good and hefty portions at reasonable prices!"}
{"text":"I have been to many Filiberto's but this location has the best green salsa and their CArne asada  is just great"}
{"text":"This place is ridiculously good. When you want some Mexican food that is fast and not some weak Americanized version (a la Taco Bell or Del Taco) THIS is the place. Other places in the country could take this food, put it on a fancy plate, and call it upscale Mexican food. We're spoiled to have such good Mexican food available to us, 24 hours a day no less. I love their carne asada, chimichangas, tacos, burritos, and horchata. If you like Mexican food you won't regret going here."}
{"text":"There are good filibertos and there are bad filibertos. This is very important to take note of, since it can make the difference of a decent go to spot for fast mexican food or  quick food poisoning. This is a decent (avg) one. The one on Dobson and southern is a very very bad one (the worst). The one in Laveen is just bad. The one on McDowell and 51st ave is very good. These restaurants  are very hit and miss so it's useful to mesmerize these like the alphabet like I have."}
{"text":"Don't go here. It's disgusting. My enchiladas had no sauce and they looked like they were sitting there for days. It also made me very sick.  A lot of filibertos are hit and miss. This doesn't even deserve even 1 star. Find a better location if you want filibees, or even go to del taco or Taco Bell if you have to, yuck."}
{"text":"I've been here quite a few time and each time my experience was excellent! The food is presented and taste great! I love that they have daily specials. Highly recommended"}
{"text":"I've gotta say that the food is good and I no longer eat at Taco Bell because I enjoy this so much more.  The reason why they don't get 5 starts is because their service SUCKS!  The girls in the drive thru are always miserable and awful, they never say hi or thank you.  They always mess my burrito up because I don't eat cheese and I don't think they understand so they always put so much cheese on everything.  I don't even care about that though, I just have to be very specific.  It's the customer service that gets me, I am a paying customer, put a smile on your face..."}
{"text":"I love Fillis but food poising by myself and a friend on separate occasions. #neverforget"}
{"text":"Elizabeth, Vanessa and Hector are awesome here, really nice and great customer service! The nachos and chorizo burrito are the best! Must try!"}
{"text":"I don't think this place ever closes. 

Carne asada burrito? Gooood.

Carne asada torta? Baaaaad. The meat is left in gristly sheets that are impossible to eat without looking...canine. Mind you, you are supposed to eat that like a sandwich. Deconstructing it and eating just the meat is nearly impossible, it just doesn't split apart with chewing or a plastic knife.

Guess who else had five of the gross kinds of health department violations. I just can't win.

And yet I will be there after Saturday night's dive bar rounds."}
{"text":"Hows the food? I wouldn't know. Ordered a chimichanga and it was not at all crunchy and the old guacamole on top just made the thing even worst. Couldn't eat it because the guacamole touched everything and was almost brown. I wouldn't come back. There's another chain near my house that is more consistent."}
{"text":"This place has some EXCELLENT, LARGE, and MEATY burritos.  They also have some pretty good horchata, and nice tortas (sandwiches).  If you're looking for a drive-through, or are willing to eat outside, then Filiberto's is a great place to get some food."}
{"text":"We went here for dinner tonight and they were not that busy service was slow. I ordered a shredded beef taco which had more lettuce than shredded beef. My hubby ordered a patron burrito. Which usually has pico de gallo and this one had nothing but onions. Overall pretty disappointed."}
{"text":"Pretty good food for the price. Buttt the workers are always rude or seem pissed off."}
{"text":"Place has gone down hill bad bad! Last few times there foods not cooked, the fries are still frozen, and they don't even put whats supposed to come with your order in your order! Beyond crap hole now! I used to love this place too"}
{"text":"I don't know her name but there is a young woman who works there literally every time I go there and she is seriously one of my favorite people to exist. If she read this she would likely recognize the bean and cheese burrito with cilantro and a side of enchilada sauce girl who is always going there at weird hours after work looking a mess. I have an annoying order which she gets right every time. She is always super friendly and sweet. Fillis is always good but the reason I always go to that specific location is because she brightens my day up because she is just fabulous."}
{"text":"This place was disappointing. I ordered their #6 shrimp with rice and beans to eat in. I had to pay more for extra tortillas which I don't mind(I want to enjoy this food). The lady brings my food out on a plate to go, (I don't care I'm hungry) she apologizes. I open the to see my food, (what the mother monkey is this)? Food did not look worthy enough to enter my hungry tummy. What a waste of $10. I'll try this place  time next week and try their fish tacos. (You get one more try Filbertos)"}
{"text":"Holy smoke! This place is sooo slow! The people act like they don't want to work there.  Rude to customers.  Waited 20 minutes for rolled tacos, and I'm sure the wait would have been longer if I didn't ask about my order.  I won't burn up my lunch hour here ever again!"}
{"text":"This was my first time visiting Filiberto's. The cashier was very unhelpful and extremely rude. She was informed that I'm new to the area from New York. I also let her know that I was unfamiliar with the menu. Her listening skills were horrendous, making me repeat myself over and over again. This young woman was talking at me the whole time as if I was bothering her. Completely disgusted by this experience. If this is the kind of representation Filiberto's has, I want no parts of it. I would give zero stars if I could!"}
{"text":"Great, cheap, and quick! If you want seriously good food, make a stop there! You will not be disappointed!"}
{"text":"Way over priced! Every other lengthy review is an employee or owner! Just a heads up!"}
{"text":"SOOOO disappointed. Service was eh, and I was told I wasn't allowed to order rolled chicken tacos, even though I just ordered this same meal from a Filibertos last week. Then I asked for an extra side of rice instead of beans. Once I got home I realized there was no rice in my to go box. No chicken tacos and no rice. Really? I've never had problems with Filibertos until today. Strongly recommend you DO NOT go to this location."}
{"text":"Before today I have never written a bad review for any business. 

Today I posted several about this place!

It's hard enough in these trying times to keep a big family fed. So when I spend my hard earned money I don't expect nor will I tolerate being treated with such disrespect!

Two weeks ago Monday I took the family for Mexican food here. We all four ordered the Enchilada Special with Two Chicken Enchilada's rice/beans and a drink. We also ordered chips and salsa for an appetizer. I asked for the chips before she brought the food and she said she would but didn't. Not a big deal but you usually get to eat some chips and salsa while waiting. Everything comes at once and the sauce on the enchilada looked weird but we were dealing with it. My wife takes a bite while we are eating chips and gets a chunk of ice. Turns out this place puts ice in their lettuce to keep it fresh. Again not a big deal till you grab a big handful of ice and lettuce and put it on top of hot enchilada's! 

I immediately took my wives plate to the counter and show the girl who takes the plate to the back of the restaurant to show the manager. She returns and says \"we can pick the ice out or make you new ones\". Really not a good answer!

I went back to the table and looked through all four plates and all had ice in lettuce and it was now melting down in the food. Unacceptable! I returned to the counter and told the girls we were not happy and would like to have something different.

Again she goes to talk to a manager in the back of the place and returns to say: \"we can make you the same thing but you can't have anything different\". Again...not a good answer. 

I asked to speak to the manager. I'm she won't come out! I ask why and was told \"she doesn't speak English\". This didn't make me any happier because I'm pretty sure to be an American Citizen you have to speak English. And for sure if you are in management at a chain restaurant in Peoria Arizona you need to speak English. 

I'm frustrated, hungry and not getting any cooperation from server and am dealing with management who doesn't speak English. On top of the rest of the normal stuff we deal with in our day! I ask for a refund and we will just take our business elsewhere! I'm told NO Again! I threaten to call the PD and they tell me go ahead. 

I return a week later to see if I can talk to a day manager who speaks English. As soon as I mentioned what happened he immediately knew about the entire situation. I ask him if he was the manager on duty and he said no that they called him on the phone. That he knew about me wanting to call PD and he was the one who said go ahead! He further goes on to insult me by saying that we ate the crappy food that we were served and just wanted something for nothing. So far from the truth.

Truth be known I had to pay for dinner twice that night and no I'm not happy and I'm not going to take it sitting down! 

You gave terrible service you served terrible food and the management did nothing to make a repeat customer since your opening feel good about spending his hard earned money at your place of business.

I don't want anything from Filiberto's. 

Not even an apology! 

I just want to let all the hard working families in Peoria AZ how bad this place treated me and my family!"}
{"text":"Just had a late night grilled chicken burrito and Mr. Pibb at Filiberto's at 6728 E. Main in Mesa.  Hadn't been to a Filibertos in YEARS.  First off -- the burrito was BIG -- and the grilled chicken was very tasty and it had guacamole inside along with diced onions, tomatoes, etc.  I asked for both red and green sauce -- and got a generous 2 little to-go cups of each -- but found the burrito was fine without out them and didn't really need either one.  It was a tad expensive at just under 10 bucks but was was a nice late night change from a burger -- and I'll definitely make a return trip.
------------------------

Update:  I've now been back a few times and had the same burrito.  It has been consistently very good.

And I found out you can get a Jr. version of this burrito which is plenty for me and cheaper too.

------------------------

BUT -- apparently not all Filibertos are created equal.  I went to one on Val Vista and Baseline and the grilled chicken burrito was really bad.

I plan to do a separate review for that experience."}
{"text":"BEWARE: Double check your receipt at this location when taking the drive thru. You might get cheated. I've been coming to this location probably 4 years now.  It used to be fine, but within the last 2 years, the majority of the time that I go here, I ALMOST always get charged for an extra item. Sometimes I get told the total, and get no receipt. The price sounds completely wrong. I'll have to ask for a receipt, and sure enough I'm charged for extra items. It's becoming extremely repetitive, and very suspicious. I hate to say this but I feel like some of the employees that work here are dishonest. I work in fast food myself so I get an idea of whats going on at this point. I have friends and family members who also have the same exact complaint with this location.

However,  this Filberto's is clean, and the foods good. It's by far my favorite Filberto's in the valley. Just make sure you dont drive off without double checking what you've been charged for!"}
{"text":"I visited this place on 9/1/2013. I love that they are open 24 hours. I recently moved to the area and after a long day of moving my husband and I were very hungry. We used to eat at Julioberto's in Phoenix (see my review on them), and I was skeptical about Filiberto's after hearing they are nothing like Julio's. However, I was pleasantly surprised. The portions are huge, like a Julio's, but the food was different. My husband's Chimichanga was great! and I enjoyed the burrito/taco combo I got as well. I like Filiberto's beans better than those served at Julioberto's. We each got a huge combo and split a drink (with a side of sour cream) for under $20, which, for the portions, is very fair. If we weren't so hungry, we could have easily split a combo, which we often do at Julio's. 
Another thing I appreciated about this place was that they got my order correct. At Julio's I often was missing little extra add-ons, or they would get my drink order wrong. Nothing devastating, just irritating and Filiberto's GOT IT RIGHT THE FIRST TIME!!
If you're looking for a late night tasty Mexican feast for cheap-- LOOK NO FURTHER and go to Filiberto's!"}
{"text":"Great prices for taco Tuesday if you enjoy stale taco shells filled with a tablespoon of chicken. Won't be back anytime soon."}
{"text":"Horrible service I'm huge on customer service. Meat was dry my sons foods was burnt and hard. 

Don't understand how it gets 4 stars"}
{"text":"Ok I don't write a lot of reviews BUT I've been to this location twice now, and it's the ONLY location that puts the pico in a separate container when you order chips n salsa in the drive thru. Do you even KNOW happy I was when I arrived home and DIDNT have soggy tortilla chips?? Can you IMAGINE? 
Well I could've gone to another location a fraction of a mile closer to get my beloved Mexican food satisfaction today, but I went to this one and sure enough they separated the pico and chips, AGAIN! It takes thoughtfulness to get my attention, and these guys nailed it! 
Also, thank you for giving me more than 2 red and 2 green sauces... All hot sauce lovers out there know that wont jgo more than a few bites.. Give or take ;)! Kudos to this Filiberto's location.
UPDATE: got chips and salsa today, came home and did a couple things because I had gotten them to eat later. Whelp, pico was on the chips and they're RUINED. Best request it all on the side. Recanted my 5 stars to 2 stars because thoughtfulness and CONSISTENCY are of equal importance."}
{"text":"This is my favorite Fili B's! The food is good and the sauces are good. It's my go to comfort food joint, whether it's a midnight burro run or taco Tuesday, I get good and hefty portions at reasonable prices!"}
{"text":"I  went to your restaurant on 91st St in Phoenix. I received my order which was very cold and unpleasant (in presentation) I notify the asst. manager Monica and she did nothing about it but give me problems and pass me to a young cashier.  The general manager is on vacation so I was unable to speak with him. I paid good money only to receive food poorly  prepared and  disrespecting customer service.  Will not return I was robbed for my money!"}
{"text":"Beware: this is very sadly no longer the mom & pop owned Kingberto's I had discovered and came to love the past year or so. Unfortunately I never took the time to write a review then because it would have received 5 stars easily. But the occasions I did stop in, I raved about their homemade salsas and let the owner's daughter know that in my opinion they had the best ones in town, especially for this type of establishment (quick serve Mexican food). I hadn't been here in a few months and tonight I was craving Mexican food and their salsas. Walk in and damn I know I've been up since 4:30 am but am I in the right place? I'm like oh they have new menus. But then I realize the menus says \"Filibertos\" sigh. Still the same owner and the woman behind register and I asked about the name change and she said oh everything else is still the same. She's sweet but let me tell you it's not. The menu is the full blown Filiberto's menu. So I was hoping the salsas and food would still taste like Kingbertos. Get home to eat and nope, the salsas and food are Filibertos now as well.  And very disappointing in quality and taste from everything from the chips (oil they're cooked in and general taste), the salsas and the carne asada, which was not tender or flavorful at all. Completely different. The employees still wear their Kingbertos shirts. But as I was waiting for my order to be ready, the Filiberto's business guys were in there and still switching out door signs and things inside. So the switch must've been very recent. So disappointing for this small business to sell to them. At least one of the stipulations should have been to keep some of their own recipes but from a business standpoint I know that's not keeping w the Filiberto's branding. But seriously like Phoenix really needs another freaking Filiberto's. I used to enjoy them and as most know, some are better than others in a pinch. But Kingberto's was way better on so many levels. Extremely disappointing and my calories would've been better spent on something else. I wonder how many others will no longer come here bc this is a poor substitute."}
{"text":"Let me tell you a little story. It's about a girl who just wanted an Arizona burrito w/ fries instead of potatoes. The villain will be played by an angry fat troll who lives in a drive thru, hates her life, and takes it out on unsuspecting tired college students. 

It was a hot & clear night in the chandler 'burb of az & after a long day of dodging bro's and fighting off general toolishness our heroine jumps in her trusty dodge along with her companion and they were off to scour the lands for something to eat. 

Upon deciding that neither wanted a fiendish burger both our heroine & her companion eagerly decided on a magical burrito from Filiberto's. Excitedly they pulled up to order but were met by a croaking voice that demanded, \"filibertos what do you want!?!\". Unfazed by the rudeness our heroine ordered, \"Two arizona burritos with fries instead of potatoes & a large diet coke.\" The rude troll barked out, \"Two cali burritos & a diet, that's $18.83\". Confused the heroine sheepishly corrects, \"No sorry I want two az burritos not two cali burritos, there's a price difference of two more dollars\". The horrible little trolls comes back, screaming, through mic, \"You want fries!?! This is how I have to ring it up.\" \"Ok fine\", replied the heroine as she pulled up to the pay window. Once at the window the troll was even ruder, giving the poor heroine dirty looks, and rolling her troll eyes at the heroines polite greeting. Upon paying, the heroine asked for 10 red sauces and 10 green sauces. Well this upset the troll and stated that after 5 sauces they would charge .50 each sauce. Well, the patient heroine finally lost it at this incredulous statement and her companion asked the troll point blank, \"you give out free and UNLIMITED sauces inside. Is it that labor intensive to put it in little plastic cups you have to overcharge?\" This was a mistake readers....the troll was so mad her fat little cheeks started twitching and she began huffing & puffing at the two adventurers and slammed the window shut. 

Finally! The food was done and as the troll opened the window to give the two beleaguered souls their food the heroine, wishing never to have a bad experience with anyone in life smiled and said, \"Thank you!!\" Well the troll was just as rude as ever and being fed up with the rudeness the heroine puts on the biggest, fake smile, and happily yells, \"HAVE A GREAT NIGHT!\"

Upon arriving at her castle the heroine begins to devour her food only to find out the California contains guacamole a terrible substance that the heroine is allergic to. Reaching for her soda the heroine take a large gulp only to notice a strange taste...REAL SUGAR! Our heroine is a type 1 diabetic and has not dosed enough insulin to cover this deliberate attack on her life! THE TROLL WAS TRYING TO POISON HER!! Luckily our heroine had not ingested enough of the substances to do her in. 

Moral of the story is this readers, this food establishment is more trouble than it's worth. You may think that you are trading your hard earned dollar for a delicious burrito but what you don't realize is that this isn't the filiburtos of yore. Nay, it has been replaced by a terrible troll factory that will overcharge at any chance & then try to kill you while they do it. Stay away. Reader. Stay away."}
{"text":"Always a \"go to\" when we start craving a little deep fried goodness with guacamole (rolled taquitos with guac--yum, a guilty pleasure).  Also seriously heart the carnitas burrito, one makes 2 meals.  Not a fine dining establishment, but much better than Loco Patron across the street, and the price is right. When you live this far off the main drag (Ahwatukee Foothills) it's nice to have in the backyard."}
{"text":"Nasty! I can't believe people consider this a great authentic local spot. Every time I got a burrito it literally dripped with grease. Can't even get a bean and cheese burrito done properly. I heard they were great back in the day but unfortunately seems like they replaced quantity over quality."}
{"text":"First impression very clean. ordered food to go and was ready really quick. first time here I asked a couple questions she did answer them but offered nothing more than a yes no. food was good and still hot when I got home. I would go back again."}
{"text":"Food is ok. Not as good as the other filibertos. Last time I went I ordered chicken tacos and they were DRENCHED  in red sauce. Customer service was good other than the fact that the guy was tweeking balls and said somebody put something in his monster..."}
{"text":"Best fast food Mexican around town. My favorites are the bacon breakfast burrito and the two beef taco combination plate. Best early morning pick me up after a long night on the town too!"}
{"text":"I wanted to give this place a couple of extra stars after trying the breakfast burritos. They are pretty tasty. I still say steer clear of the chicken fajitas though."}
{"text":"I've bought their burritos at this location and they are pretty good but they could use improvement on their carnitas burritos, it was a little dry and not enough pico de gallo.  I like their Taco Tuesday because their taco shells are not store bought like Herrera's where it crumbles when you take a bite of it.  It would be nice if they could serve half nachos, it is too much and it would not taste good if you save it for another day.  Another thing that they could have which they do not have like the other Mexican restaurants, have FREE chips served with their already FREE salsa, cucumbers and carrots with jalapenos."}
{"text":"Mediocre. Only good for the drunken masses, way better Mexican around. Their flavors do not mix fully, seems like it's just a bunch if stuff thrown together with no time used to prepare. Go to burrito express for good burritos before 9pm."}
{"text":"The lady at the front was rude... maybe because she is pregnant. Not sure if she is having a bad day but she wasn't excited to see anyone. Also, it took like 30min to get my tacos. But they were good!"}
{"text":"Good food, it took too long to get out. The lady at the drive-thru was busy talking to her fellow employee to notice me waiting for my food. Other than that, pretty good experience"}
{"text":"The lady was very friendly while taking my order. It was early in the morning and they were able to make a chicken burrito."}
{"text":"I placed an order of carne asada fries and waited about 20 in the drive thru for them. Very disappointed. There were no customers waiting either, so they weren't busy. Will not come back here again."}
{"text":"I was shocked when I only spent $7 here, and got a huge burrito, drink, and chips with red and green salsa. Move over Taco Bell. Reminds me of food that abuelita would make really quick in the kitchen. The only thing that ruins it for me here is the service. Whether it is the drive thru- or stopping inside to eat. They just seem angry that you are giving them money. This is definitely the best fast food/mexican in the east valley, but don't expect to be greeted with a friendly smile all the time. Just remember, the food is good and take it at that."}
{"text":"Again, once I got home they had screwed up my order and over charged me for chicken tacos I didn't even order.  Pretty simple, a breakfast burrito and a 3 rolled taco with just cheese.  Over $20.  With a lengthy line of cars behind me, I realized why I was soooooo over charged,  This place has horrible service and doesn't know the simplicities of taking a simple order.  The are lucky I was eager to get home and didn't complain at the window with so many cars behind me.  Will NEVFER return again.  Taco Bell is just fine for fast food when in a pinch."}
{"text":"Food has always been good at this location: no food poisoning and tastes great! The wait can be a little long sometimes but only like 3-5 minutes longer than your average fast food place. To me, it seems like the longer wait times are due to the fact that they make to order things since I've never seem the employees be lazy/slow and even with no one ahead of me, it always seems like they are making the order just for me!"}
{"text":"The only good thing about this place is that it's open until 430 am 

Food was gross 

My burrito was full of oil, literally it oozes oil as I took a bite. 

Carne asada fries were inedible. 

Chicken tacos were like canned chicken. 

The only reason I don't feel that embarrassed for eating here was because I was drunk and nothing else was open.


Never again."}
{"text":"Yelp makes you select a star but ZERO STARS!!! Went to this location ordered rice and found a hair!!!!! Asked for a refund and the employees where really rude and all laughed about it amongst one another. The two female employees working the drive thru didn't apologize or barely even wanted to refund me!!!! I wouldn't recommend any kind of service from this location it is horrible. No customer should be treated like this. I really do hope everyone reads this, and it gets shut down. I am disgusted!!!!!,I posted a photo.."}
{"text":"Having been coming here for a couple of years now.  We like the tacos on Tuesdays (99 cents) but usually order other items.
Would not rate this a spectacular place, but for reasonably priced sit down Mexican food - it is pretty good.
Has a big selection of items and always busy when we are there.
Very clean."}
{"text":"Great location. Can't beat daily $1.49 specials. Only fast green chili burro that does not have rice, avocado or anything coming between me & my tender chunks of beef in a tomatllo chili sauce. Drive thru!"}
{"text":"The best Mexican food in Phoenix.
I always thought that you had to go to New Mexico or Texas to experience great Juevos rancheros.
Not true, it's here."}
{"text":"been here a few times es before.  My rule of thumb is give a place 3 chances before rating them.  I have eaten at many  filibertos in my life and generally they are good with huge burritos and don't usually skimp on the ingredients.  This one however skips on everything and charges $8.00 tax not included for a Carnes Ada burrito w cheeses and sour cream only.  They are tiny 1/2 the size in comparison to other filibertos that I have eaten at.  Today was the topper when I got another tiny Carnes asada burrito again.  It must be management being super cheap and rationing the burrito fillings here but three strikes and your out.  I will literally cross the street and get a bigger better tasting burrito next time."}
{"text":"Every tuesday rain or shine without fail for almost twenty years my family and I get the tacos at filibertos. I take that back cause as I type; I dont have a grease stained bag permeating an aroma of deliciousness in my car! My day was awful enough; lost out on a 13,000 dollar business deal, had everything I touch turn to crap, but the one saving grace was gonna be \"fili-b\"s as we call it. WRONG! I arrive at the place a few minutes before midnight and proceed to wait through the teller chatting it up in espanol to his buddies(yes I know they were his friends cause this gringos got some bilingual skills) till its 2 mins after midnight. I finally get my turn and ask for my tacos and the cook(whys the cook taking ordersl play the no habla card. I then place my order in spanish and magically the guy speaks english. Hell he couldve been a spokesman for rosetta stone. Wednesday he keeps saying, I explain that I had waited through his chatty cathy bs session and just wanted two tacos. \"Wednesday\" is all he says and proceeds to leave counter and cook. First off: I know the day, dont need any assistance there. 
Second off: Im not sure which is more appalling; the bad service or rather comllete lack there of or tge fact that he wasnt wearing gloves was handling money and then starts handling food without even faking that he washed his hands! Filibertos Ive dealt with the price increases, ive dealt with short staffed locations after every ins raid, hell ive even dealt with locations being closed unannounced when its supposed to be a  24 hr establishment and no response from their website after several times asking for resolution on this....but no more. The tenario brothers are setting themselves up for a fall big time. Im not the only one who feels this way. Go ahead and bite the hand that feeds you, pretty soon someone is gonna bite back. There are good locations but because of the proximity of ghid location to the university(ASU...go sun devils) they have taken advantage and are collecting their golden goose eggs too soon. Bet ya that nothing changes and noone resolves this. Ill bet a taco, wait.....I cant do that cause apparently its WEDNESDAY! 

One star cause I can't go any lowet on yelp.

Tenario brothers respond if you tener cojones ya bunch of tirones codiciosos!"}
{"text":"Top faves: Carne Asada burrito/fries, & Rolled tacos. Guilty pleasure, After hours grub!"}
{"text":"I generally dont leave too many reviews, but the food here is awesome and we hope they stick around for a while so I went through the trouble of resetting my password just to leave a review for these guys!

We've been here a few times already and I have tried to order different things each time and have been impressed each time! They have really good specials too ($1.99 Burritos on Mondays, a little smaller than their regular burritos but still a good deal!) They have a pretty legit salsa bar too, these aren't just generic salsas either, they're all really good.

With a \"bertos\" name, you would almost expect them to have a drive thru but I dont think it's worth knocking off stars for... However, they do put your order together pretty quickly and you can call your order in for pick up if you're that impatient."}
{"text":"this restaurant had the worst customer service. thought I'd try it out since I needed a quick bite to eat. the cashier was extremely disrespectful to us and was very unpleasant. I highly don't recommend    wasting your time or money here. it took 15 minutes for us to receive our food and they even got our order wrong after I very detailing explained to her what I wanted and it was a simple order. I will never eat here again and I had a bad first experience."}
{"text":"This huge  girl that was getting my order had the worst attitude ever and she threw the my debt card at me. She was unprofessional. Why work at a place you dislike?"}
{"text":"I was stuck in Phoenix on business and had a late night craving.
Nothing was open except Fast Food after 10pm.  I did not want Fast Food Chain Fast Food... bleh...

Then I yelped, and Yelped pointed me and my rental car in this direction...

Could it be? Could it be Arizona's loosely semi chained fast cheap greasy mexican food like Alertos and Albertos and Los Primos of the OC?! COULD IT?! ANSWER ME!!!

Well I tried it out, and was not disappointed.

I tried the Patron's Burrito... SO GOOD and BESTEST combo burritto I've ever eaten anywhere!
I tried the Carnita's Burrito... It was ok, have had better.
I tried the Egg and Chorizo burrito... It was good.
(Yes, this was all in one trip, in one night, for one person... I was hungry...)

All in all It wasn't comparable to my memories of Alertos in FV during the HS years, but it was as good as it gets in the middle of the Arizona desert @ 1am.  And that is all I needed."}
{"text":"Best fast Mexican food in Scottsdale.  We get food to go once a week and the portions are big.  The prices and quality are also good.....Long live Filiberto's!!!!!!"}
{"text":"Poor customer service and poor quality of food. This was my experience this morning ordering a breakfast burrito over the phone which was not ready when I arrived, and had to wait an additional 25 minutes for an overcooked burrito."}
{"text":"The food was good but Customer Service was horrible!!!! I will never go back because of the service I received. The cash register girl never bothered to say \"Hi\" \"Welcome\" how can I help you\". She never said a word to me, she was certainly having a bad day. She gave me a face as if I was bothering her. Never going back to that location."}
{"text":"I went through the drive thru on last Sunday Afternoon. They had a new fellow at the restaurant and he was learning. He is not reason for post . He took my credit card to pay and it was taking a long time more then 3 min and did not come back and I got worried. I got worried and honked . The manager opened the window. I asked what going on with my card and he said if I did not like it I can go somewhere else. Very rude  and handed back my card . This was not even about the food. This was about protecting my information from being written down.   I explained that and he did not think it was a big  deal. Never apologized. Tried calling owner and same supervisor picked up phone."}
{"text":"The place is good. The flickering lights in the drive thru need to be fixed before somebody has a seizure!"}
{"text":"Very very slow drive thru service.  15 minutes and I was the only customer. The employee doesn't even reach out to hand you the food, or my credit card back and had me reach all the way towards her for it. The meat on the burrito is very dry and over cooked. Waste of money."}
{"text":"F**k this place..0 stars Neva Again.. F- customer service..What more can I say...Please go outta business"}
{"text":"I live up the street and I have tried this place many times and I always feel the same! The food is terrible (dry) I know a special race who eats dogs that eater better than this piece of *poop-* establishment. Sadly will never be here again this location can lick it! It's rated a B and that's shows it's a problem in believe this place is serving week old food or dogs ! This facility needs to be investigated or revamped"}
{"text":"I've been on a kick with this place as of late.  I enjoy their Taco Salad and Nachos.  I'm not adventurous with meats but for me the regular beef is quite delicious.  So far no greasy meals to date.  The food very good at a really reasonable price."}
{"text":"Total disappointment! The shredded beef taco was a deep fried taco that had more lettuce and tomatoes with cheese than beef. \"Where's the beef?\" I was hoping for a better taco when they cost $3 each. I felt like a rabbit grazing when I was expecting to feed my inner tiger. 

Point being if you cannot even get a taco right then you have issues with the rest of your menu. It's a taco! The easiest thing you can make in food industry. I ain't coming back. I'll try a different place to get my taco fix. Sadly Jack in the Box tacos are better than this place and cheaper. That's saying a lot. 

Also, all you want hot sauce that's very runny!  You decide. Otherwise they had TV for you to watch and kept the place clean."}
{"text":"Nothing special about this place, i guess a burrito is a burrito anywhere, good for a quick ,heavy,crappy meal if that's what you're looking for....and be ready to digest it for the next 3 days,not one of my favorite places."}
{"text":"This place is the slam!!! If I lived in Tempe, I would eat here at least once, possibly three times per day!"}
{"text":"\"Better than Federico's.\"
I always get a country burrito or sausage burrito. It's decent, well-priced, and the drive-thru is fast. The store seems pretty clean and the staff understands/speaks English well. The green sauce is nothing special. You get what you pay for, it's fast food."}
{"text":"Filiberto's can be hit or miss depending on the location. This is my second-favorite location. My favorite thing on the menu is the carne asada fries without guac (I hate guac anyway, but there's tends to be super runny... yuck) and it is absolutely fantastic in a really guilty pleasure sort of way. My second favorite thing is the green chile plate (pork) and I always get a second tortilla. My boyfriend gets the two beef taco plate and I really like it too. 

One thing to note is that if you order a burrito or a quesadilla (one of the plain ones, not one of the fancy ones likes the carne asada) they usually don't come with ANYTHING in them besides meat and the listed veggies. No cheese, sour cream, etc. You have to get it on the side. Which is fine, but the first time I went to filibertos in high school I ordered the chicken burrito and it was good but it is literally just a tortilla stuffed with chicken in red sauce. I need some dairy in my burritos!

I've never eaten inside here. I've never even ordered inside. I find that these places tend to be less clean than I would like so I just don't bother going in."}
{"text":"the food is really good and quick.  not the best but really good.  hours are a plus 2 - open 24/7!

the horchata is some of the best in AZ too."}
{"text":"Mixed results when I come here.  Sometimes quick and friendly, other times you sit and wait really long times.  I've had pretty consistent food quality from this location though.  Prices seem to be rising to an unrealistic amount for a burrito though.  If they keep going up I don't think I'll be a customer any more."}
{"text":"If you're here, you already know the deal. Salsa bar FTW! It spoils me, as I can no longer visit any other Filiberto's location in good conscience. Must try after the pub closes."}
{"text":"The food here is not up to the standards of the other locations and the salsa is some of the worst I have ever had. It is basically just red water.  I have attempted this location about five times since it was so close to my home but every time has been very disappointing.  I have tried the regular tacos, rolled tacos and a couple burritos and nothing is as good as other locations I have been. I must stress again how bad the red sauce is, it is unrelentingly terrible."}
{"text":"I tried this place because the filibertos near my house is so bad (mcqueen and pecos). The food itself at this location was pretty good but everything else was sub par.  My friend and I ordered five rolled tacos and a ham breakfast burrito respectively.  The cashier spoke clearly at first but when she said my total she very much mumbled it but I thought nothing of it in the moment.  Turns out the prices had gone up about a dollar but they had not changed the signs so I did not know. She explained and I understand situations change but it came across as dishonest. After the longer than usual wait for our food we headed home to eat. The burrito itself was actually pretty good but the red sauce was absolutely terrible. There was zero spice and just barely an attempt at flavor. Some folks don't care for sauce but i find it to be an essential part of any Mexican dish. Perhaps I just caught them on an off day but it was a disappointing first impression."}
{"text":"Sloppy tacos, horrible customer service, the girl rushed us while ordering our food NEVER AGAIN!!!!!"}
{"text":"I've never gotten sick from this place, and I don't have an iron gut.

Only major complaint is that this one for some reason doesn't have the green salsa. Not a huge red salsa fan, never have been. But a good verde goes a long way. Or not, if you eat here.

Girlfriend likes this one the most. Its supposed to be the \"OG\" Berto's in the area. I take her word for it, she grew up here. I've always loved the carne asada burros."}
{"text":"Stopped in Saturday 02/20/2016 for dinner as we have many other times. Thought this was the best place to eat in Buckeye...well until NOW...absolutely ticked me off when the HOSTESS (Miss Blondie) was being overly emphatic about us not taking a booth...thats for \"big Groups\"...piss on your big groups little nieve girl...we have always been Big Tippers and boastful about this Filbertos...but NOT ANY MORE...usually the manager would come around and make sure his customers were okay...well apparently not today and this conceited hostess and waitress who couldnt even fake \"a concern\" didnt bother getting the manager because I'm telling you something was \"off\" about the chicken dish I ordered...I refused to eat it...got a to go box...to give it to my dogs...thats how friggering bad this was...never had my experience been so horrible at Filibertos until today....I wont be coming back thats for sure, but I will tell you now...the little uncaring waitress...would have never got a penny in a tip from me for her fakeness...better learn little girl....you dont get good tips from being a FAKE....you screwed yourself out of $20 on a $22 meal..because you simply didnt care...but Filbertos has screwed themselves out of our normal $80 tab....we were so ticked off we didnt even bother ordering our normal alcohol drinks...it might have INCONVENIENCED the waitress and the lazy hostess girl."}
{"text":"Okay... So I used to like this place. I ordered the carne asada fries no guacamole because I'm allergic sadly. The drive thru lady had an attitude problem and rolled her eyes at me when I'm pretty damn nice. Rude as hell... Then my food looks like crap fries are soggy yet somehow burnt, sour cream looks gross, barely any cheese at all... Tastes like cardboard I just wasted like 7-8 dollars on this. Only came here because Los favoritos was closed. Never again...."}
{"text":"They don't know what the el Gordo burrito is at this location. Maybe they should look at their own website!  All the others know what it us and make it no questions asked!"}
{"text":"This location is horrible. First off only some employees actually know how to work a credit card machine. If you have a card with a chip you might not want to go here I was just told they couldn't take my card. However two weeks ago no problem. I've been told this more then once here too. But the location on Elliot and McQueen no problem taking my form of payment and was pretty quick. I guess they will get my business from now on. Furthermore the wait is always ridiculous even if there is only one car in front. They just don't seem to have it together. Can't take your payment, getting orders wrong and the wait for fast food is too long. Get it together!"}
{"text":"If you live in the phoenix metro you've heard of filibertos. This particular location is newer and clean unlike the other ones i have been to. 

The food quality is tasty and comes in big portions. I come here when i need a taco fix. I always get the 5 taco plate that comes with carne asada, adobada, lengua, al pastor, and my favorite carnitas. Its awesome and inexpensive a lot better than eating bk mcds. 

Love this place. Try it!"}
{"text":"I came here at 10pm on a Wednesday night and ordered a really annoying, complicated, custom order. I'm always wary when I make a custom order because I know it can be confusing and there is a lot of room for mistakes, but the guy working the drive thru was extremely attentive and patient and made sure that my order was made exactly how I asked. When I got to the window, the same server was extremely sweet and explained to me how he rang up my order based on all of my customizations. The food was delicious and fresh too. Awesome service at this Filibertos. Very sweet staff."}
{"text":"Good food........drive thru service was alright.....not sure if the cashier at the drive thru was having a bad day or what..........more than likely will go back."}
{"text":"Worst restaurant ever. Don't go here. I waited 40 min at the drive thru only to receive burnt fries and cold meat. The food was disgusting and the service was terrible. Please stay away from this establishment."}
{"text":"We had made a purchase at this location through drive through. We had to remind the cashier that we had drinks she had forgotten to give them to us, I ordered 17 tacos and drove home. When I got home we were only given 12 tacos. My husband called and confirmed if it was okay we go back and get the rest of our order since we were not given the order complete the person on the phone said sure no problem come back. We drove back the cashier at the front window called me a liar once she said that to me I asked for her name and her managers name. She would not give me any information. She informed me that since she was not there during the transaction that I was not telling the truth. I was embarrassed and shocked with the attitude and customer service that I received at this location. I told her that is why we called before and now we don't get our complete order, we don't get our money back and we don't get an apology for driving back only to get treated horribly. The issue was not resolved I had to leave my name and number and was told someone would call me. The owner called me the next next and informed me that cameras showed otherwise and that I was cussing at his cashier Im appalled. Im reporting this to th BBB I have never been talked to or treated this way ever!!"}
{"text":"Been to numerous Filiberto's(es?) in the Valley, this one is definitely the best, hands down. Totally agree with what Kayla R. said. 

The ladies who work there are super-duper friendly. I only go there once a week; nonetheless they always remember me and what I ordered! Amazing people.

The Arizona burrito (steak, cheese, potato) is sooooo good. I really love how they are never stingy with their meat. And on Mondays, they have 99cent rolled tacos. I don't eat corn tortilla, I don't even eat their regular tacos (which my brother loves), but for some reason I absolutely love their beef rolled tacos. They are so generous with their cheese and by the time we got home it would be all melted on top of the three rolled tacos.MMMM

Their carne asada burrito is great too! Oh, and their carne asada fries! Sometimes it could be a guacamole overload. If you don't like that, you can ask them to put it on the side. 

A special that is not on the drive-thru menu is the Texas burrito. My brother is absolutely in love with it. It is a chicken burrito with sour cream. It didn't sound appealing at first, but when my bro insisted, I tried it, which turned out interesting in a good way. BTW their burritos are not expensive at all, $4 something each. 

Since I love spicy food, I always get their super hot red salsa. They also have the green salsa, and the brown mild salsa. Pickled carrots, jalapenos and onion are also available for the customers. 

Next time when you get a burrito, try this: take a bite, when you get to the meat part, put some onion on it, pour some hot salsa on it, take a big bite and enjoy. And that's what heaven is like. 0=) Except you don't have to wait, b/c it's 24/7! Woohoo!"}
{"text":"I am incredibly disappointed and baffled by the experience I just had here. We've been coming here for a long time , taco Tuesday is an easy go-to for our family so we frequent here a lot, or at least we did. I will not be returning after tonight's incident We were in the drive thru ordering, our order was repeated back to us to us twice. (12 tacos; 6 chicken, 6 beef, pretty basic) We get to the  window and the girl takes our $20 saying $6.79 is the total then closes the window. She comes back with $6.80 in change and a receipt saying the total was 13.21 and the change due from our $20 was what  actually was $6.79. She also handed us a bag  of food. Not sure what it was but not ours. The receipt showed 2 tacos, 1 soft chicken taco, and a bunch of drinks that she never gave us. Most definitely a wrong order and not even close to ours. We point out the mistake and incorrect change and amounts. She argues that was what we ordered and says she never heard an order of 6 beef 6 chicken. Quickly puts in a rush order for the correct order and then asks for the change back so we give her the receipt and the money she handed us back as change and then she precedes to ask where the remaining  amount is. She  actually tried  to accuse us of stealing the difference from the incorrect total  that she not only  read to us wrong but  then also miscounted back wrong . This was absurd. She actually tried to argue and say they were going to look at the cameras . Yeah. That's how hard it was to just admit her mistakes. So we argued and offered to sit there while they checked the cameras or offered to wait for the police to show up so we could just get our money back . After a few minutes and a lot of scuffling and yelling inside She finally gave us more attitude and said She didn't have time to go look at  the cameras and  tried to finally give us our correct order and correct change. We told her we just wanted our money back she finally gave it to us and then still tried to give us the food. We were so appalled, embarrassed, and fed up with the whole situation that we just drove off. Never again will they get our business. We drove down to eriberto's  on 7th St and bell and they not only got our order correct but were happy to take our money (the correct amount) and treated us great, the food was delicious and had a better taste to it anyways. So overall it worked out, But I'm so incredibly offended and disappointed  with what occurred here. And even  more frustrated that I now have to go out of my way  Mexican food now because this girl didn't seem have a clue and then continued to make matters worse by trying to accuse us of somehow being at fault for her mistakes. So ridiculous, don't waste your time or money here."}
{"text":"This place has THE BEST carne asada in Phoenix.  I've tied many many other places, even places that say that theirs is the best. But Filibertos never says theirs is the best because the best doesn't have to say it. They have proof. They've hot the carne asada. And they don't fill their burros with rice and beans to fluff their food.  It's all goods. You've gotta pay extra for that stuff."}
{"text":"0 stars please.
This place is the worse. There is no warmth, just about everyone who works there are rude and don't give a flying you-know-what about their JOBS. Had they cared about their food even, it would not be greasy and tasteless and buried under cheap cheese. The only thing I have been ordering these days are the nachos as that is the only thing I can tolerate, until recently. I ordered it again, with extra guacamole this time. It usually comes with it, but not enough for me. The wretched woman taking my order even asked me a second time about the guac and I acknowledged her. Lo and behold I get home to see that there is no guac at all, not a spec. How do you ask for extra and not get a thing? Simple, the idiots there that work don't give a damn. Its not worth the time or money, do yourself a favor and DONT GO."}
{"text":"Staff is friendly, gets crowded at times. Always feel like I am getting my money's worth but they are a bit on the pricey side."}
{"text":"Not bad, not bad...could be better. For some reason they are a lot more expensive then I remember. I love mexican food! Even taco bell but if I have a choice I will still drive down to Los Betos on Hayden and Thomas."}
{"text":"Here's the deal, I have eaten there a couple of times and each time I have hopes that it will be better than the last time. It never gets worse but it really never gets better either. The food is not authentic like they like to advertise and when I first moved to AZ I had such high hopes. To this day I tend to make better mexican food then I can find out in Phoenix. And seriously, no chicken ALL day? What was up with that. The staff is NOT friendly at all and have the look of drones on their faces."}
{"text":"ohmahgahd pozole. they have pozole all day every day now! And 10% off for Yelp review! I'm gonna eat the dickens outta some pozole."}
{"text":"WAY over priced. One taco 2.99.. Seriously??? And waited over 10 mins in the drive thru.  Poor.."}
{"text":"If you like roaches in your breakfast burritos... You have come to the right place!!! Won't be coming back here again!  Bleh!!!!"}
{"text":"I don't know what to say.  2 fish burritos and a coke for 13 bucks.  the burritos were big.  if there are two of you just get one and split.  The fish was deep fried which sucked.  I don't know if you can ask for grilled.  They don't ask.  I don't eat beef so that kind of limits me.  the beef could be awesome and chicken great.  Better than taco bell, but i would have to go back and try it again for a solid grade.  but if you are hungry and you will eat anything they seem to have a lot of specials."}
{"text":"Cool little bar in the middle of know where so it's nice to stop by every once in a while. And it's nice and clean in there, Bartenders are on point.......put new castle on tap suckas!"}
{"text":"I would give it no stars if I could. Over rated and too expensive for the quality of food you get. Plus senor taco is across the street.. I'd rather go there."}
{"text":"If I could give a  negative star I would.  Stay away folks the drive up cashiers are idiots.  Ordered carne asada fries and super nachos carne asada.  Clearly ordered no onions.   The receipt even stated no onions.  Got home and guess what?  Tons if onions.  I called they said Come back tomorrow we will make it good.  I should have wrapped it up and let it ferment overnight.  Because when I got there the little tart cashier starts lecturing me about they will only do it this once.  Damn right I will only go once because when you mess up my order  I don't come back .  I only went back because $20 is a lot to pay for the those two items.  I don't need a lecture or any accusations that I was lying. When I get there some idiot pretends he is the owner which obviously he wasn't since he started yelling at me. Had to drive off and left their cacca asada fries for them to eat.  I predict they won't be their too long.  Business don't survive with idiots behind the cash register."}
{"text":"Ok folks. The food is pretty decent.  But don't expect any customer service.  They have a salsa warden at the drive thru that will only give you two .5oz sauces for 3 burritos and 3 orders of rolled tacos.  She says she isn't allowed to give more out!  But your allowed all you can load inside!  Even if you get frustrated and tell her you want to buy it.  She will give you two.   I go to eat my food the way I want it.  If I like it drenched with sauce and I order it at the drive thru and request more sauce with my order I think it's good business to charge me and send me on my way.  If I could use negative stars I would."}
{"text":"Absolute trash, she gets the order wrong and then denies that she did, she blamed us for it and denied to give us the right order until the cook said yes, absolute trashy service."}
{"text":"I waited at the speaker for at least 2 minutes before someone came on the speaker. I ordered my food. Carne Assad fries, no guacamole and sour cream. I pull around the bend and there was a grey Cadillac with a few people in it. They seemed to be friends with the drive thru person. They pull off within 15 seconds. I get to the window. It took at least 4 minutes before the guy came to the window to inform me, he put guac on my fries. Meanwhile in my car, I can hear a female and other employees laughing and having a good time. My problem is, if they weren't jacking around; they could have got my food right and not have me waiting in drive thru for 10-15 minutes. This isn't the first time. I work in this business, I know exactly how long it takes fries and meat to cook. Horse play is great but not at the expense of a customer."}
{"text":"Whenever I'm in town I have to stop in - I'm addicted to the carne asada burrito. The salsa bar with the jalapeño and carrot salad hits the spot!"}
{"text":"I don't think they give half stars so they get one. I actually used to really like this place but idk wtf happen, they had to of switched chefs or something.  They're beef is dry in their tacos. I asked for bacon egg burrito and it was soggy bacon and egg shells in my burrito. And just tonight I ordered a chicken chimichanga meal and they have me a deep fried bean burrito meal wtf! I'm done with this place who ever is in there cannot cook!"}
{"text":"Food was marginal at best. I didn't expect much and that's exactly what I got, so no let down. The food was at least hot. Restaurant was dirty regarding tables. Cheap food or not, place should at least be clean. I did notice one employee cleaning a table with a dry paper towel. She was basically pushing n smearing food around. Need to be trained! Yikes!"}
{"text":"horrible lazy staff!!! they must be miserable human beings to treat customers so poorly!!! i will never step foot in this sh*t hole again. false advertisements on posters for their kids meals. failure to make it right!! f*ck this place and their nasty ass food!!! stay away from this place!!! this place is also filthy dirty, there must be a million roaches."}
{"text":"Since they opened, the food has been consistently fresh and awesome! 
The restaurant is tucked away on the west side of the Fry's Plaza, sooooo if u blink u'll  miss it. 
It is a small place but very clean and bright. The staff are all friendly and helpful. The FREE chip and salsa bar is a nice \"added\" feature. If u eat n, u also get FREE drink refills.
The food is all cooked to order, hot , fresh and FAST. Everything I've tried so far has been excellent. I especially like the fact that the burritos don't drip oil/butter/grease while u are eating them. Everything is seasoned just right, and they have a salsa for every palette, from mild to \"make u sweat\" hot. 
DONT PASS THIS HIDDEN GEM UP!!! I hope they can make a go of it and be around for a long time. 
PS- This is not a big place, it's made for quick, fast, REALLY GOOD mexican food , like mom makes. A neighborhood cantana/cafe."}
{"text":"There are so many Mexican restaurants with bertos at the end of their names. And almost all of them suck. It sounds harsh, but really, it's true. However, Filiberto's stands tall as the best of all of these. As a Mexican restaurant, it is great, but as far as atmosphere goes, you're not gonna get much as far as this location goes. Luckily this is the only location I've seen that has a drive-thru, which is because the building was a Burger King about 7 or 8 years ago, then turned into an Eddie Chan's (I think that's the name) and now a Filiberto's. The Filiberto's was around for at least 5 years and is still going strong, which only attests to how good it really is."}
{"text":"Wow!!  FINALLY!!  A fantastic quick Mexican restaurant here in Anthem!!  Forget the rest Filberto's is the best!!"}
{"text":"While the carne asada is good the cheese enchiladas need some work. They are never melty enough. Last time I got one it looked as if they just dumped shredded cheese in it and sent it out."}
{"text":"Has been for many many years, the best place for Breakfast Burritos as well as Mexican Food. Lived here for over 30 years and every time I'm in town I have to go here. Like I said BEST BREAKFAST BURRITOS!"}
{"text":"This particular location always dissapoints like getting your order wrong, making you wait forever, terrible customer service, sub-par quality food just thrown together. I remember the glory days when everything was twice as good and half the price. But this location  blows always has. Everyone working there seems like they hate you as much as they hate their own lives."}
{"text":"One of the best filibertos that I have been to, hands down. Carne Asada fries are actually made with the chunky crinkle cuts, unlike the wimpy tiny side fries like the ones found on apache and Dorsey's filibertos. Love the service, love the chip bar and the sauce bar, the girl who took my order at like 3am was nice, and every time I go there I have a good time, unlike the one at Apache and Dorsey! The place is clean and well maintained too."}
{"text":"I love Filibertos. But the quality of the food depends on its location. While the one at Guadalupe and Mcclintock remains my favorite place to go to, this one is my LEAST favorite mostly because of the location its in. It's drive through only, so unless you want to eat with the angry mob of religious folk protesting planned parenthood next to you with images of dead fetuses, I suggest you just take your food and get out of there.
Every time I go there I also get harassed by homeless people who hang around Food City and Filibs who ask for \"just some change\" so they can get something to eat, and when you do give them exactly \"some change\" (25 cents or so) they give you this incredulous ungrateful look that a beggar should not have. 
There are also  handful of loud, obnoxious college kids who get drunk at mill who stumble toward Filibertos after getting off on the light rail.
And a couple of seedy, dirty half-homeless looking people who always are always trying to sell you something. 
Food wise though, the heftiness of the burrito is actually dependent on who makes it. The younger, smaller male makes my burrito half the size of what I normally get, and the Carne Asada Fries either have too little guac or too little sour cream.
 It's still good if you are incredibly desperate (my fat ass has a loyalty card there), but it's not like it's a fine dining experience."}
{"text":"I ate here twice, chicken tacos with rice and beans. Tasted really good. The second visit, within one hour of eating the food, I had a terrible case of food poisoning. I won't go into the details but after voiding what I had eaten there, I felt weak but better. Now I can't pass that place without remembering how sick I had gotten. Never again."}
{"text":"El restaurante está cruzando la calle de mi departamento hemos ido varias veces y ninguna de las veces nos ha gustado Y si le hemos intentado varias veces no nomás con una vez que no nos gustó ya no fuimos varias veces compramos diferentes comidas y todo fue lo mismo la comida no tiene sabor y si entiendo que obviamente la comida tiene grasa tiene aceite pero es demasiado el aceite los tacoa escurren aceite como si fuera jugo como si fuera agua recomiendo que los empleados antes de servir los tacos dejen que se escurran unos minutos antes de entregársela al cliente Yo sé que quieren tratar de sacar la comida rápido entregar rápido la comida pero eso está afectando la calidad de comida. La carne desmenuzada que agarre en un plató estaba muy seca y dura como cuando es de un día anterior o cuando tiene mucho tiempo en la línea una carne se puede revólver y agarrar carne jugosita Pero esa estaba dura seca. Los empleados no son muy profesionales andan hablando entre ellos no se concentran en el cliente que está ordenando"}
{"text":"I don't recommend to go during the night time.  The workers are cranky, very poor customer service.  It's also very slow regardless if it's empty or not.  I have also encountered a piece of hair on my burritos.  I truly recommend Mikey's Restaurant Mexican Food in downtown buckeye.  They close earlier and are closed on Sunday's but their food is incredible!  It tastes like homemade food!  They are always happy to see you!"}
{"text":"3 words: food poisoning. Beware!

More words: This used to be my favorite one, but last weekend we got terrible food poisoning and the only thing we'd eaten in common was burritos (an Arizona and a bacon breakfast) from here.  Maybe stay away for a while."}
{"text":"Good to have a Filibertos in S Phx., food was gud but I think their California burrito needs to taste like the ones made in mesa :)"}
{"text":"I gave this place one star cause zero is not an option I waited 30 minutes for a bean and cheese burrito. There is some guy with his hat on sideways just walking around the kitchen the lady at the counter was so unfriendly she just kept giving me this dirty look. When I got home the burrito I waited 30 minutes for was hard as a rock. I wonder if anyone even reads these this place is out-of-control"}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite Mexican restaurants. So glad I found this plac. The food is great. The salsas are hot and tasty. We drive here even though it's a far drive. Not all Mexican food tastes the same so it's worth the drive. The pollo asado and carne asada is yummy. Super nachos and asada fries are a must try. I hope you enjoy like me and my family do..!"}
{"text":"They were a bit mystified by the 50 cent off check on coupon, but let us use it anyway."}

 store Is old but fairly clean as well. I'd definitely come back here with my buddies."}
{"text":"I give five stars because the food at this location is fresh and the service is great - their Carne Asada diced steak is fresh and tender and Beef Enchiladas is very tasty. Side dishes are also great. 
The drive through takes a reasonable time , about ten minutes for two orders.  You can be sure that your meal was made to order and was prepared specifically for you."}
{"text":"The food is what it is and we all know what we are getting isn't high quality but decent food and price. However when the drive through gives the wrong burrito to you and you call they will only refund if you drive back. Also when calling they literally don't even care a little bit"}
{"text":"We decided to try this out tonight for this first time and we were not disappointed! The carne asada burritos are delicious and could easily feed two people. We got the #14 combo plate that comes with rice and beans. My kids loved the beef tacos and the rice and beans as well. My husband's only complaint was the salsa. If they had some more authentic salsa to go with their foods I'd give them 5 stars :-) It's a little  more pricey than something like taco bell, but you get much better quality food."}
{"text":"Bought an Arizona burrito and every bite was cartilage. Called the manager and he said I had a wrong location and then said no one ordered around the time I did. So I said would be happy to bring my receipt and bag of cartilage. Busted. Proof in hand and he could care less. So all customers with a complaint are liars until they the managment was busted lying? Will never return, forever ruined Arizona burritos for me :( amigo dogs on Glendale is my go to Mexican food place now. Super awesome customer services and NOT once have I gotten a bad dish."}
{"text":"I have been going to this location for years. Today was a bad one. My wife ordered a bean and cheese enchilada style with extra cheese and extra sauce that we paid extra for, and they didn't put extra nothing on there. When i asked for a little cup of enchilada sauce he said he put it on there, but there was barely any. I asked for a little extra he said he will charge me. I said you you already charged me. He said he wouldn't give me any extra sauce unless i paid for it. I said i come in here allot and i will take nut business elsewhere if he didn't give me sauce. He told me go ahead he didn't care. Wtf really. I will never eat at this location again, i will just go to RIO MIRAGE CAFE INSTEAD.  Screw these unprofessional assholes."}
{"text":"I would advise staying away from Filiberto's Mexican Food. Overpriced roach coach tasting Mexican food. We ordered a carne asada burrito and carne asada fries for a total of $18 Jesus Christ! ( I guess that minimum wage increase was a bad idea)

At the window I said I wanted my burrito with everything and told them to add rice & beans. Welp they forgot the pico. I would say if you want to charge me $10 for a burrito it better be spot on, this wasn't the case. My burrito tasted like it came off a food truck (hell even some food trucks have better tasting burritos than the burritos they sell here)

What a shame. Please stay away from here, don't get robbed."}

of course the arizona burritos are good, everything is good. i used to LOVE one of the combos... you get a beef burrito, taco, rice and beans... for UNDER $6.  wow.  color me silly and call me sally. they have bomb horchata too.

really good and fresh flautas/rolled tacos and breakfast burritos. damn, everything here is good, whether drunk or sober."}
{"text":"Solid 3 stars, maybe 3.5.  Lets face it, Filly-B's is great drunk food.  Any other time, it's just okay.  The bean and cheese burro is a good deal, especially on Wednesdays when it is just $1.50.  I had lunch there today and my bean 'n cheese was somehow lacking in....something.  Not sure how that can be in a dish that includes only a tortilla, beans, and cheese.  It's faster to go inside this location than wait in the drive through. Buy me a few drinks and this place gains stars on my review amazingly quickly."}
{"text":"Disgusting. I like cheap Mexican food (Amados, Carolinas etc). Beans are like baby food. Rice is mushy and pasty. Tacos have three times as much wilted lettuce as dried meat. Nasty. Ive tried it three times now. Breakfast burrito pours grease out the bottom even with a wrapper."}
{"text":"I usually love these small hole in the walls. This one disappointed me because My chicken burritto and my wifes carnitas burrito were made from frozen meat. I watched them take it out of the freezer and put it on grill frozen. they both tasted bland, but there carrot salsa was super yummy and help salvage the food. The service also lacked, I felt like I was interupting the crew by wanting to order food. Hope they improve cause its next to my house. I will give them one more try and report back."}
{"text":"To quote Lucille Bluth from Arrested Development: \"I'd rather be dead in California than alive in Arizona\"

Obviously, she's never had an Arizona burrito.  I'm live in CA and have had great California burritos, but the Arizona Burrito dooee!  It's open late too and perfect after Mill Ave.  Apparently they have churros too?!  Wish I had seen that on the menu.  Anyway, bring filibeez to California plz. thx."}
{"text":"lady that served me needs to sleep, dark circles under eyes look like me in high school when was on that go fast, as she chewing on somthing taking my order. I been coming here for about three months and its not bad , but dang broke man is stuck w, most bang for the buck. But last visit is today!!!! order a chicken burrito, and these stupid people decided to put a real leg chicken bone inside, maybe mexican humor or somthing, uncalled for and will never return or encorage another to go to this hole in the wall location, go to a different one. Sad"}
{"text":"Go here if you want to wait 20 mins in a drive thru for food that tastes like shit! Uncooked chicken any everything full of oversized cut onions. Terrible business"}
{"text":"there is a little Mexican gem behind this filiberto\"s location, after I tried it no more, no mas Filibertos for me"}
{"text":"Ordered carne asada fries the man who took my order asked if i wanted salsa. I ofcourse said yes as i use 4 containers just for my fries. Since he asked like a jackass i assumed he packed my order with salsa. I get home to find i have not one container.  Im now eating my fries dry. Lesson to be learned here? Alwayz check ur order before pulling away. Never rely on the resturant."}
{"text":"Here on a Thursday evening. Fast service. Cashier is very welcoming, always a smile on her face. Food is very tasty and the carne Asada Fries are always on point. Make sure to stop by for your lunch. You won't be disappointed"}
{"text":"Best kids meals in town! We always order the junior bean and cheese burritos &  yummy crinkle cut fries (but you can order chips instead). The kids meals also come with a cute mini-Churro and a bottled beverage--which is way too sweet for my taste so we ask for fountain drinks instead. And don't miss the ever-so-satisfying country breakfast burrito, which definitely feeds two!"}
{"text":"I've never had such a bad experience at a drive through. First of all he was rude when I ordered. Second I specifically asked for no pico or sour cream and it was still on my fries!. Hears the tea ladies he charged me extra for it too!"}
{"text":"This place is conveniently open 24 hours a day which is great! So when I'm up late, I can fulfill that late night craving for Mexican food. I love the bean and cheese burritos, carne fries, and rolled tacos. They charge $1 for cheese in your burritos and $1 for sour cream on the side which is a little much... But it won't stop me from coming here. Love the food!"}
{"text":"I went to taco Tuesday yesterday & got the worse food poisoning from the Chandler location. I usually go to the Tempe location & never had a problem. Tempe Filbertos always had great quality, fresh food."}
{"text":"When I lived in Arizona, Filiberto's at Ray was my favorite place to grab a cheap and delicious Burrito. Now that I'm back in Boston, only a select few understand the greatness that is Filiberto's, and that's a major unfortunate. While Boston has a lot to offer, they don't have a Filiberto's five minutes from my apartment, and that is one huge thing I miss about Chandler. 

The Arizona burrito with extra Green Chile salsa and a large Horchata was a combo for many a drunken night, and I shall forever be indebted to Filiberto's for that. 

I'm not arguing full on authenticity, nor am I advocating healthiness. But what I'm saying is Filiberto's has the cheapest and most delicious Burrito I am likely to ever have again, and I wish I could get them on the Eastern Seaboard. 

You're missed, guys."}
{"text":"The girl that worked on 17th ave and Glendale was sooooo  Rude!!!! I'll never go there again!!!"}
{"text":"I usually love Filibertos, but this was my first visit to this particular location and I won't be going back. I went to the drive through and ordered my usual, a chile relleno burrito. There was only one car in front of me. When I pulled up to the window I was asked what my order was again which I found weird since it was rather simple. I gave them my money and waited, and waited. They obviously just started making the meal when I got up to the window since they didn't even know what I ordered. I received my order and drove 2 minutes back home. I started to eat the burrito and realized it was barely even warm, and some parts were still cold. I continued to eat and then had to pick out big chunks of what I am assuming was the cheese, about 4 of them. Solid, somewhat squishy chunks of cheese. I have never had this happen before, and it grossed me out. Usually the chile relleno burritos are delicious (that's why I always get them), but this one was disgusting and a waste of money. It has been about an hour since I ate it and my stomach doesn't feel too well. I work in the food industry so I understand things happen, but I am disappointed that they didn't communicate to me what the problem was and that they obviously rushed my meal and skipped out on the quality of it. I would have much rather waited a few more minutes to receive a quality product than the crap I received today. There is nothing I hate more than wasting my money and I will not be going back."}
{"text":"Filibertos has some good food for breakfast and dinner. My favorite is the breakfast burritos (steak and egg, bacon, chorizo, etc.). They also have some solid entrees for dinner available, and the pricing is decent.

The negatives are that the drive in is slow and service is slow at times, and some of the meals are kind of greasy and messy. But if you are hungry for Mexican food it's not a bad choice."}
{"text":"Steak ranchero was on point and the horchata was tasty!! What else could you possibly ask for."}
{"text":"First time visit was great, then every other time got progressively worse.  What started as a shredded beef burrito, ended in a soggy vegetable mess.  Prices way too high for the quality, that's a fact."}
{"text":"I've only been in Tempe for 4 days, but I've already been here twice--once a tad inebriated, once completely sober. And both times, I was pretty blown away. 

The portions are beyond generous, cheap, and come with a variety of toppings depending on what you order: cabbage or jalapeno, cilantro and onion  or onions, tomato and guacamole. In addition, this one of the few restaurants (certainly of the fast-food ilk) that offer lengua or beef tongue. Their beef tongue taco was tasty, rich, greasy and fabulous--producing in me the mixture of bliss and self-loathing than can only be matched by the consumption of a Cinnabon.

Filibertos on Apache Boulevard is right across the street from me. And it's open 24 hours. I forsee many future visits for me, particularly when a little sloshed and starving--a time when I would much prefer some greasy cow tongue in my mouth than the tongue of a hot blonde.

Well...except for January Jones."}
{"text":"The meat here is horrible and the horchata is nasty, taste like dirty sink water. I do not recommend this Filibertos."}
{"text":"There is a skinny Mexican guy who works overnight. He doesn't give a shit about your order and doesn't give a shit about you. I've ordered many times here during after hours and he has fucked my shit up. I'm sick of it so I'm yelping his ass...excuse my language. Avoid this place during midnight hours. He will fuck your order up and laugh about it with the cook. I'm half Mexican and could care less what someone's ethnicity is. I'm just trying to make you aware that you need to avoid the skinny Mexican guy at filibertos on Chandler during after hours. He is a complete dumbass with a negative attitude. Any filibertos I go to (with exception of Chandler) they're always on point. Chandler filibertos sucks at overnight!!!"}
{"text":"Over-priced in my opinion. Paid a little over $9 after tax for 1 burrito off the menu, and nothing else. (regular-sized burrito) You get fries and a drink at most other places for that amount of money. Service was slow, and I got the wrong kind of salsa that I asked for, but at least the girl at the drive-thru window was friendly."}
{"text":"Me: Can I have a large order of fries?
Lady in speaker: we don't sell side of fries.
Me: oh ok (knowing I just got some the week before)
Lady in speaker: we have carne asada fries?
Me: No thank you
Lady in speaker: how about I just take the carne asada out?
Me: That would be perfect, thank you. (why couldn't she just do that in the 1st place?)

I get home.... theres road kill on my fries. 
If it wasn't for their delicious chile relleno burros, I'd still be going to Taco Bell. You get what you pay for though, and the service comes with it."}
{"text":"24 hr mexican. I always get the fish burrito and drown it in the red sauce. Cant really make an objective review since anything tastes pretty good late night.

Likewise I hav never been to this place during the day."}
{"text":"Well not sure I would give it a 5 star review. Its a Filibertos --- nothing really wrong - nothing really outstanding  except I like the carrots and cucs."}
{"text":"I used to like coming here.. I thought this was the place that came close to the Mexican food in CA, but that all changed. We ordered 2 orders of carne asada fries and was ready to chow down when we got home.. As we were eating, my boyfriend discovered hair under the fries!! I'm talking about long hair from a girl... Hair probably down to your shoulders.. It was disgusting!! Never have I ever saw hair this long in food. We didn't even eat the other order, just threw it away because we were so mortified... Every time I think of carne asada fries it just freaks me out."}
{"text":"Yeahhh 1 star this time, NO stars if you ask me but YELP wont allow me to post this without a star..it's been awhile since I went to this place because of the last bad experience we had w/ hair in my food.. We were hungry late last night and my boyfriend wanted Mexican food. Because we did not want to go anywhere far, we gave it a shot thinking things would be better.. He ordered rolled tacos and I had chile rellenos.. First chile was fine.. Second chili, OMG!!! I stuffed a big bite in my mouth and I ended up pulling out a whole toothpick!!!!! Wtf!!! Never again.. Your place blows! You need to get shut down because obviously you don't have careful cooks/workers there!"}
{"text":"This Mexican fast food restaurant looks run down but the food is good. I like their daily specials Monday thru Friday. 99 cent Taco's on Tuesday and 99 cent Bean burrito's on Wednesday. 60 cents to add cheese.

 There is one friendly old Mexican guy that works around midnight to 6AM. He makes the best Bacon, egg and cheese burrito i ever eaten. He always greets me by saying in a thick accent\" How are you doing my friend\". 

Wish i stilled lived near this restaurant. i used to always eat there."}
{"text":"They have a terrible service it's really bad disappointed for all the new customers that walk into this establishment"}
{"text":"Strip Club+ lots of drinks+ Filibertos Carne Asada Burrito= great night!"}
{"text":"As im ordering my country burrito and a drink inside I see raw meat in a package on the counter from sprouts. Its just on the counter were the food gets handed over from the cooks for the to- go orders/ inside. Then I get home and find a piece of chicken in my country burrito which is supposed to be potatoes and eggs no meat. Not going back here."}
{"text":"Deep fried chile relleno is so yummy. It's been a weekly habit of mines for months now. How could you pass up a $4 burrito stuffed with 2 chile rellenos, pico de gallo, guacamole & sour cream? The hardest part is stopping at one. God bless the Mexicans and their delicious food!"}
{"text":"One of the worst filebertos on the westside... Carne asada burritos are bland and filled with Pico de gallo.. salsa is super watered down. I gave them 3 chances and was disappointed all 3 times"}
{"text":"I'm in AZ, it's Friday night and time for dinner.    As my friends are still unpacking into their new house, they suggest coming here for dinner.   I think \"A sports bar?   Umm... OK.\"

As we pull in the parking lot I see Filiberto's Mexican food and Filiberto's Sports Grill in the same building, right next to each other.  I s'pose if your gonna have two restaurants, might as well have them next to each other, right?

We walk in and there had to be 15 TV's up on the walls, wow!
http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/filibertos-sports-grill-buckeye#6B0YjP5z6og8LX4_Yoo-xg

SERVICE:  Our server Lizette was pretty cool and did a good job tending to us.   I think my joking around might have been a little more than she was used to, but she handled it well.   The bar tender actually came out to our table to confirm something about my drink after I ordered my 2nd margi, pretty cool!

I eventually had 2 strawberry margaritas on the rocks (they have no blender - $6.50 ea).   While he first one was very tasty, with fresh sliced strawberries in it, I could not taste ANY booze in it!    I got our servers attention and mentioned this to her.    She suggested \"a double shot\" with the 2nd one.   I did ($3 more?) and the 2nd one was much better.
http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/filibertos-sports-grill-buckeye#bT0AiGkZpunA1MFQzwYcyw

FOOD:  After my friend told me what he was going to have, I ordered the same thing, Sizzling Chicken ($10.95).    This is two grilled chicken boobs on sautéed red & green bell peppers and onions, mixed with melted american & jack cheeses.  This came with a bowl of instant mashed potatoes (with a lot of cheese mixed in, perhaps to mask it was instant potatoes?) on the side.   Bar food at its best baby!   The chicken / cheese / peppers & onions combo was actually pretty darn tasty, better than I expected!!!   Now I just have to make an appointment with my cardiologist to roto-rooter that gook out of my veins!   LOL

OVERALL:   A nice, but pretty noisy sports bar with decent bar food at reasonable bar prices.   3.5 stars rounded up."}
{"text":"Good specials.  Service is always slow, but they make up for it in the food."}
{"text":"Not vegetarian. They recently raised their prices again, the food is decent and I use to like coming here, but after this latest price raise I won't be coming here anymore. 

The cheese isn't vegetarian and probably never will be...I've gotten bean burros with meat in them when I didn't order it that way...it should be obvious to any vegetarian that this place isn't for you. In any case they just lost a long time customer. I should have stopped sooner, oh well lesson learned."}
{"text":"Why the rampant fuckwaddery, Phoenix?  I've been to other Filiberto's/Poliberto's/whateveriberto's restaurants before and really loved the food.  But this place, along with pretty much every other fast food Mexican place in the valley, falls prey to the flaccid-burrito issue.  Seriously, what the hell?  How hard is it to roll a burrito tightly or pack it full?  Especially when you don't offer any extras that may lead me to think it's rolled loosely so the customer can unroll it to add condiments.  Not even lime for the fish burrito- by the way, what's with the lack of condiments offered in Phoenix too?  Depressing.
So.  Food is probably a 4, better than average tasting.  Sometimes it's really greasy and you need to tear a hole in the bottom of the burrito to let it drain while you eat.  Or in my case I learned to stop eating at that point lest my stomach seek revenge later on.  Carne Asada is tasty.  Fish burrito is mayo-y.  California burrito is really good.
Their ability to roll a proper burrito is non-existent."}
{"text":"Excellent food at an affordable price.  If Mexican fast food is your scene, there are few rivals to Filiberto's.  In my former life as a fast food aficionado, I found myself daily at the drive-thru window of Fliberto's ordering breakfast burritos.  All varieties excellent!  Huge burritos overflowing with yummity goodness.  Nothing hits the spot like breakfast at Filiberto's.  Now that I have reformed my ways of eating to embrace a healthier lifestyle, I still find that there are yummity healthy options like the pollo asado burrito minus the tortilla.  The salsa verde is excellent.  You can switch your flour tortillas for corn tortillas and ask for grilled options.  I have shopped around and still think Filiberto's is one of a kind.  Eat well. Be well."}
{"text":"Food is amazing. Service and speed is horrendous. I've given up and stopped going despite the fact that it's one of few things to eat out here and they are so dang slow every time."}
{"text":"Sorry excuse for a filebertos horrible staff carna asada full of grease carnitas full of grease dirty restaurant meat taste like it might make me sick you will be better off going to taco bell"}
{"text":"I have been filibertos for 3years!!!! I just had my steak meal I can't believe it I spent 10dollar for tiny steak!!!!same price less size!!!!!! Last time I had steak taco !!!but they gave me taco but !!!with out meat !!!!are u kidding me ? I won't come to this store anymore!!!!  I wish I can post pictures!!!"}
{"text":"Ordered beef enchiladas, never had them with bell peppers and onions before.  Pretty nasty tasting.  Will not go back"}
{"text":"I ordered a special potato burrito with small amount of beans and with rice and guacamole, I got a cheese burrito instead.   I got no apology or sorry for it.  Second time I had pieces of meat in it. 

How does meat get into a vegetarian burrito?   I truly think they did it on purpose. (At 6:30 PM)

I asked for the manager and they said \"to call the number on the receipt\"   I called and they answered it themselves. 

I think that customer service is not good anyway but when someone like me orders something not on the menu they become frozen in place.  The cooks get all out of their comfort zone and start blaming the customer who to them may seem picky, when in reality I am vegan and I don't each cheese or meat.   They don't understand this, this is to them a difficult customer.  

They were puzzled and did not know what to do, not a word of sorry or we can re do it for you.    I have photos of the pieces of meat in my burrito and left w/o eating it.

I sent a \"Contact Us\"  message to their non existent \"customer care dept.\" and got no response or reply, so I reviewed it on Yelp.

Orale Jose! Que quiere ese guey? \" Mandalo a la fregada, que no friege\""}
{"text":"Was super excited to try a torta there.  What a slop of a mess they served me.  No pride at all in what they are doing.  The bread was old and hard. The cook's aim was really off.  The only thing that landed on the bun was the carne asada.  Only about a fourth of the other ingredients landed on the bread with the meat, with the rest on my plate.  When I took it back for a refund the cashier agreed that the bread was bad but when she told the cooks, they had a 'I could care less look on their faces.'  One cook made eye contact with me but he kept smiling and talking to his crony.  This was my second bad experience there.  Not gonna waste my typing skill on writing about that one.  blah!"}
{"text":"Good food and friendly service l, not 5 stars only because you do have to check your food prior to driving away. Other than that, it's good."}
{"text":"These guys are sleeze ball fast workers at their best gave us empty tacos, gross food no personal care, the works...the lady taking our order smelled like feces...the food as well, what's their health score? I don't want to know...sad they get paid to work there. I'm spoilt from filabertos. Home cooked meals now I guess. This place and the people working their were disgusting. Can't say it any other way. Gross gross gross gross...but what do you expect from 16th St and McDowell?"}
{"text":"This is our very favorite place for breakfast, lunch or dinner. The food is amazing! Carne Asada, carnitas, chorizo, no matter what type of meat, it is all made to perfection. The burritos are huge, the super nachos are mind blowing, and the kids meals go above and beyond. The crew is super friendly. Prices are more than fair and they even have a daily .99 special. They have an A rating with the health dept, too. I checked!"}
{"text":"WOW. The guy that handles the drive, he must really hate his job. I feel bad for you, I'm sorry you aren't happy with your current place of employment. HOWEVER, that gives you no reason to be disrespectful to the people that are paying you, the customer. I seriously have never in my life had such a HORRIBLE experience, not even at McDonalds !!!! He was such an asshole."}
{"text":"Been coming here for years.  This is the greatest FILIB'S OF ALL TIME.  No doubt!  Food is consistently delicious"}
{"text":"Worst of all the filibertos. Took my mom there 6-25 and both of us ended up with food poisoning. Dont know if this place is dirty, is reusing old/expired food or has someone contaminating it purposely but I will never go back to this place ever. EVER!"}
{"text":"I love this place!  I eat there all the time!  The food is great and they are very nice!  Never had a problem with them! !!"}
{"text":"Worst customer service. I could swear that the employee that took our order through the drive thru had just woken up to take our order on a Sunday at 9:30 am. We pulled up to the window, waited three minutes at the window without being greeted or acknowledged so we just drove off and tried  Tamales Guadalajara for the first time (it was so yummy!) Definitely won't be coming to this location again."}
{"text":"Rude staff. Slow service. Messed up order. Refused to fix the problem.
We ordered a bean and cheese burrito with green sauce, a bean and cheese burrito with sour cream and onions enchilada style, a chicken quesadilla, a large horchata, and a grilled fish taco plate with rice and beans.
My husband repeated himself twice that we wanted \"grilled fish tacos on corn tortillas\" 
This order costed about $40 bucks.
After we paid, the woman who took our order completely left our sight for about about 10 minutes. Then finally came with our food. At a typical restaurant, this would be totally fine but I thought this was supposed to be fast food? There was only 1 table of people eating inside.
The burrito didn't have onions and the fish tacos were breaded and fried.
I came back to the location and talked to the woman who took our order.
I told her the situation and she proceeded to tell me they only have fried fish tacos, not grilled. This was never mentioned before when we had clearly asked for grilled. I would have ordered something else if I had known. Instead, I paid close to $10 for a small portion of refried beans and rice. I asked her if they can make this right somehow. She refused to do anything."}
{"text":"If I could give this place less than 1 star I would. Horrible experience. Horrible time management. No surprise that they have horrible customer service. Ordered a beef chimi with a beef taco and chicken taco. Then we pull up and wait... and wait... and continue to wait some more.. then we see them bring a bag that looks like ours to the window before we even pull up because there is still the same car in front of us at the window. It took 40 minutes for us to get to the window, keep in mind this whole time cars are coming and leaving the drive thru because they are getting impatient, and she hands us the same bag that has been sitting there for the past 20 minutes. We check our food and it's cold. Everything was soggy from sitting that long. We ask for an explanation, and the lady tells us the cook is slow and doesn't listen to their complaints, and that she'll make ours fresh, so we happily agreed. Then comes the second wait. Another 14 minutes passes as she makes our food, then delivers a beef chimichanga with only like 2 tablespoons of soggy beef in it, no pico, no cilantro, & we ask her to give us a lot of green salsa, and she gives us 4.. I will eat 4 alone with 2 tacos, chimichangas need at least 5. Like come on. We ask to be compensated and she says to come back tomorrow and speak with a manager because she can't do that. All I can say is we will never be back."}
{"text":"It is clean, and much better than most filibertos. The owner ( I'm assuming) was there very friendly man! This place is on track to success great customer service and smiling faces. The food is amazing! I'll be back!!!"}
{"text":"I used to only ever get the breakfast burritos from fillys, but since they are  only minutes from my office, I started going for taco Tuesday. The dollar tacos are amazing. I now go every Tuesday. It is an amazing value for great food. The staff is very friendly especially for the area where some of the younger employees at some of the other restaurants aren't as thrilled to be handling customers. I will be continuing to go to filibertos."}
{"text":"Doesn't matter what you order, late at night like tonight. Try to bs you and tell you that you order something else. The compromise is you buy what you want and the other thing they made up. So they charge you for both!!!!  Haven't been there in the day so only talking about late night"}
{"text":"I usually love this place but my last visit was not so great. I wanted some Crne Asada fries so o came here. The French fries were barely cooked, the amount of the toppings was really sad. I might have gotten 2 tbs of carne asada and even less of sour cream and guacamole.
Really disappointed with ththis visit."}
{"text":"From my visit here, I could say that I wouldn't return. I didn't have any gripes other than the food itself is a little below average with the flavor not matching the price.

The wait after I had ordered wasn't long, and when I had recieved my burrito meal nothing was wrong or out of place with it so I had started to eat. During, I noticed how underwelhming it tasted. There was no wow or pow to the burrito, the beans were just beans, and I never relished any of it. I had a full stomach in the end, and that's about all I can say. This restraunt may satisfy some looking for a Mexican food stop every now and then, but if your a Mexican foodie, this restaurant has nothing to offer you."}
{"text":"First time to this Filibertos, we ordered the Super Nachos and a taco of adobada, I ordered over the phone, the food was ready when I got there, and the staff was friendly.
The nachos (big serving, at least for two people)and the taco were good. The taco has a lot of meat with two regular tortillas, we made two tacos out of one.
I will recommend this place, if you're in the area and craving something Mexican the last minute...."}
{"text":"No rellenos when I came in late night over the weekend,
no salsas in the salsa bar.  Low budget period?
They're running on minimalism unless I hear different.
However I heard the salsa bar is filled at 6AM!
OK. 
I was disappointed, but my Arizona burrito was good and heavy.
Don't forget your shootable red sauces!"}
{"text":"I was really craving chilaquiles this morning so I pulled up and tried to order. The lady handling drive thru informed me that they didn't have them. Defeated, I began to pull forward continuing my quest. As I reached the window, she waves me down and says their chef will try to make them for me. I don't have any pictures because when I opened the box I immediately began shoving it all in my face! It was perfect! There were eggs and beans and rice and of course CHILAQUILES!!!! Although this delicious breakfast was not menu, the staff this morning went above and beyond to make me happy as a customer. I will definitely be returning. 

P.S. Can someone tell the owner to put this on the menu ASAP ?!"}
{"text":"Worst service u ever had!! Ordered 4 times and drive thru girl still got it wrong, then she had me sit around and wait for my coffee and never gave it to me. Left with no coffee and foodI didn't want. Called and asked to speak to a manager and I got the same dummy because the manager no speak English ! What a joke never again"}
{"text":"I used to love it here because I've been a faithful customer for years, I have the loyalty card. Every time you buy food and use your loyalty card, you get 1 point per dollar. 50 points is a free burrito. There is a guy who works nights there who is SOO RUDE and tries to act like he cant speak English! I went the first time and he charged me almost 10 dollars for a carne asada burrito! Those only cost like 5 dollars at the most then when I asked what the extra 5 was for he acted like he didnt speak English...again. The next time I was literally screaming in the drive thru like \"HELLO HELLO\" and then finally pulled up and he acted like he didnt see me. So I had to get out of the car with my 10 month old and order from the window. All occasions I encounter this guy he takes rewards points off my loyalty card instead of puts them on. I should have had a good 3 free burritos by now. Ugh just so frustrating. Food is okay, but not worth the terrible service!"}
{"text":"Screwed up my order twice. When I pointed out the second screw up, they just sent me packing. Won't be back."}
{"text":"How do you mess up Mexican food? Ordered chicken tacos and a chicken burrito. When asked what's in the burrito no one knew what was exactly in it. The chicken was like rubber. All for $18. You couldn't pay me to eat there again."}
{"text":"Went to Filiberto's because I wanted fish tacos. Was very disappointed because the fish tasted as if it was sitting out for hours maybe even days, and recooked. I took one bite and that was it. When I approached the workers not only did they deny that the fish was bad, but they refused to give me an order of something else at no cost. Very disappointed and never going back!"}
{"text":"It's great for a quick meal! Obviously it's not going to be pulling out all the stops when it's literally a 24/7 drive thru. Have been going here with my parents for the bean and cheese burrito since I can remember!"}
{"text":"Food is good. I usually get the Arizona burrito. Live it. Service is pretty slow tho. It took about 3 min to take my payment. Lady was nice but didn't apologized for slow service. I got free water tho lol. I'm happy I got my burrito fix"}
{"text":"A few months ago we noticed a Filiberto's coming to the corner of Cave Creek and Lone Mountain. We were interested to see where it was going in and then realIzed it was part of the gas station.  
Once it opened, we waited a few weeks to give it a try.  Before going, we looked on Yelp and saw the poor reviews one right after another. We decided to wait.  Then we saw a few people on FB rave about it so we finally decided to give it a try. 
It was an absolute mistake.  It was not great, not good and not even ok. I can only assume those raving about this restaurant we're friends or relatives of the owners because it was awful. 
We ordered two carnitas burritos and they were oily, fairly small, and had little taste besides the greasy taste left in  your mouth. There was a green semi-creamy substance that I think was supposed to be guacamole. It was more of avocado mayonnaise- yup as tasty as it sounds...
We will not be back."}
{"text":"This location at 19th ave & Bell is normally my favorite Filibertos to eat at, I've been going there for years, even after moving several miles away. I pass up the closer Filly B's to go here. Not anymore.

In the last 6 months it has REALLY gone downhill in quality, and service isn't too far behind. Tonight we, again, wasted over $35 on food that was un-edible. Of all we ordered, 1 shrimp burrito was *almost* finished out of hunger. The other shrimp burrito was beyond the normal heat that accompanies it. It was SO flaming, spicy hot it was un edible. It burns just thinking about it today, and I like a bit of heat normally. Even my husband who loves HOT said it was too hot.

The super nachos were ruined by horrible tasting beans...they were very old, \"antiseptic\" tasting and bitter. The dark brown, over fried and many burnt chips didn't help. The nachos were trashed.

Worst of everything was the 2 orders of menudo. The meat was disgusting- over cooked, slimy, fatty pieces of nasty, cheap meat- there was no honeycomb tripe barely at all. I wouldn't even feed it to my begging dogs. It was like having a mouthful of hot slime, I had to spit out. It was gag worthy. (3 weeks ago it was delicious- tender but firm, a good blend of mostly honeycomb/lining )  The last 2 weeks we've ordered the menudo its been wasted. It didn't even taste like it had been cleaned well. Perhaps they were serving reheated menudo from last week- who knows.. Even the lemons tonight were slimy, broken down & squished...rotten in spots where they were brown.

I can't begin to tell you how many times its been bad and food has been wasted in the last 6 months. I'm finally at my wits end...we've probably wasted close to $200+ in food in the last several months- 70$ in the last month alone. I keep going back thinking its a fluke because it simply happens on occasion-but not anymore. I'm tired of my hard earned money being poured into a restaurant that no longer cares about quality."}
{"text":"Customer service seems to be nonexistent here. I walked in just after 11:00am on a Thurdsay and I was the only customer in the restaurant. There was a female at the register when I walked in. She looked at me, never said anything and turned around and walked in the back. A few minutes later a man came to the register, never said anything just looked at me. I gave him my order and paid for it. Still not a word from this guy, he was too busy talking cook. After I paid he just walked away, my receipt still in the register. 

I sat and waited for my food, still the only customer in the restaurant. After a few minutes my order is ready and sitting on the counter. Still no one behind the register. I had to walk back up to the counter and ask for my food that had been sitting back there ready for several minutes. The cook came out from the back to give my my order. 

I order the beef taco plate. The tacos were dripping with oil, disgusting!!!

I will never eat another Filibertos EVER AGAIN!
Next time I will play it save and go to Taco Bell."}
{"text":"Food made me sick. Was terrible quality and not even what I ordered. Not impressed. 
Unless you want good poisening, DO NOT EAT HERE."}
{"text":"Great Mexican food. Everything tastes good, good salsa and the staff are always friendly. Good prices and good food. I like this place."}
{"text":"Filibertos is one of those places where you go for a late night snack or a \"Munchy Meal\". Its quick, its affordable, and its decent, but is it all that, uhhh?"}
{"text":"There's one word that best describes this place: Ehhh. NO really, it's nothing special and it's definitely on my list of mexican places to avoid in Arizona. Yes, I'm one of those annoying people who like to compare everything to California... so this is for my northern Californians who are searching for a place as good as La Vic's :(

I came here last fall after a night of drinking, and of course, like any other drunk person I just wanted some greasy ass mexican food. I got the carne asada fries and I remember them satisfying my craving.

Fast forward almost a year, my bf and I were starving and just needed a quick fix in the middle of lunch and dinner. We head over to Filibertos (completely sober btw) and order the carne asada fries. What a freakin disappointment... the fries were super bland and I felt like I had to force myself to finish them even though we were really really hungry.

Moral of the story: Filibertos is only good when drunk. But then again, Denny's is like a 5 star restaurant after a night of drinking. So all I can really say about this place is ehhhhh..."}
{"text":"Fantastic tacos. I tried the carne asada and the carnitas. Great flavor and juicy. The salsa doesn't have a lot of flavor, and reminded me of tomato juice."}
{"text":"I just picked up a Arizona burrito. The burrito was cold and the meat was un-eatable. I figure since it was the only thing open I would give it a shot. I feel like it needs to be good since they stay open 24hours. I am very disappointed that I spent 7$ and my time waiting to get a burrito that sucked! If it wasn't 12:45am I would go get my money back!"}
{"text":"I love this place!  Authentic mexican food at inexpensive prices.  Friendly and attentive staff.  The cleanest Filiberto's I have seen.  I visit at least once a week during the lunch hour.  The Chile Rellenos are awesome, lightly battered, lots of spicy sauce... just simply delicious.  Taco Tuesdays (99 cent tacos) are a great bargain.  Complimentary salsa bar with multiple hot sauce type salsas, sliced cucumbers, and a fantastic spicy carrot/onion/jalapeno/chile salad... all free.  My only complaint is the salsa bar, soda fountains and cashier area, which are all located up front, can get very congested... I wish they could rearrange that somehow.  Oh, plus it would be nice to offer a chunky (pico de gallo) type salsa on the salsa bar, similar to Baja Fresh.  Check out the website for coupons - great deals!  You also will receive a bright orange (can't miss it) set of coupons with each purchase, to use on your next visit.  I'm a fan!"}
{"text":"Being a little skeptical as to if this would be any good, on the recomandation of friends figured I would give it a try bad location due to the aroma from the cows across the field not horrible but since it's a chain not an independant personally did not find to be great but edible"}
{"text":"Best breakfast burrito in town!  Nice cooked to order with your choice of delicious salsa.
Soooo good!"}
{"text":"Filli B's is the best quick Mexican drive through by far. Great food, made the same way with the same quality EVERY TIME. At Filliberto's you always know what to expect  and it keeps me coming back every time."}
{"text":"I work near here and have a choice of 4 Mexican Food joints between 35th and 51st. I came here while my friends went to Viva next to Fry's. I ordered the carne asado burro. It was ready even  before I filled up my drink (literally 20 seconds). I should have know something was wrong right there. I found a clean table after passing a few dirty tables.  I notice the burro was big. I dug into it and the entire burro was cold. I went to the counter. She said it was only cold because of the guac and pico that goes inside it. BS.  I care to differ.  She was somewhat cool and  they immediately made me another. The new one was ready in about 1 minute.  It was definitely warn and was okay. Not as big as the first. 
 
I've now been here for 40 minutes now. They have had about 3 walkins. The original dirty  tables still have not been cleaned and now more have been used and need immediate attention.Sad that they don't care about how the place looks to customers. Also, the Spanish TV was on way too loud. They should turn that down too. The TV is for customers  not for staff to watch while they are supposedly working. AIso, the cook originally served cold food and the staff in the front obviously don't give a rats ass how the restaurant looks.  If they dont care about what we do see, what does that day about everything we cant't see. F this place. I'll go to Viva next time with my friends."}
{"text":"Not so great menudo was awful, the burritos well lets say glad I didn't live to far away needed a bathroom quick!!"}
{"text":"If I can raite this place has no star I would. I came here late at night and they got my order wrong on the window. And instead of remaking it the guy on the window yells to the cook to just wash it off . He even went back to make sure that was what he did. Unbelievable I told the guy bro I speak Spanish and I know what you just said so just keep your food and my money have a good night.. I strongly suggest you don't ever visit this place...."}
{"text":"Yes, I'm giving them 5 Stars and here's why...

Filiberto's doesn't try to be more than what they are which is authentic good Mexican Fast Food.  You can come here for Breakfast, Lunch, or Dinner and the whole menu is available.  This can be especially comforting if you want breakfast in the afternoon or a bean burrito first thing in the morning.  The staff is friendly, bilingual, and genuinely seem happy to be there.  Make sure you check out their daily specials like the 99 cent Bean Burrito on Wednesdays!"}
{"text":"Talk about customer service! There is a ricos on every 3rd corner so never come to this one."}
{"text":"My family and i stopped by for dinner lastnight it was super packed but we had friendly service and were seated immediately. With that said our server was ontop of things while under pressure she was in, we never lacked anything while we ate great service and food!!"}
{"text":"It pains me to even rate this as 1star.... I had this experience at the store on 54th ave and glendale.

As soon as I entered the store the chef was yelling \" el baño no esta funcionando\" \"no sirve\". Mind you not a word was said as I entered the store, this was in the first few seconds of entering the door. So how he \"assumed\" I was there for the restroom is beyond me! 

I went in to grab something to eat because it was a long day at work and I didn't feel like cooking! All just for the chef by the name of \"Miguel\" to assume I was some random person trying to use the restroom. I told Miguel in spanish, I was not concerned about the restroom and if he wouldn't be so quick to assume he would've realized that I was there to place an order to go! Miguel then said to me again that \" el bano no esta funcionando\". In complete frustration, I proceeded to explain to Miguel that, if would listen then he would understand what the purpose of my visit was. He then stated \"que chingados quieres\" which basically translates to what the fuck do you want. In a complete utter awe of the outrageous behavior relayed towards me, I requested the name of the chef (which was at first denied to me), along with the name and number of the manager or store owner. After various requests for the information, I was only given the first name of the employee and the manager. This behavior is absolutely unacceptable. I'm still trying to make sense of this whole ordeal! 

I know this is a really lengthy review but I think someone who acts this way should not be working in customer service let alone the food industry!"}
{"text":"Lost my business forever. I ordered a number two  (burrito and taco combo) clerk said what kind of burrito, I said (as I have many many times, as my stomach shows) Bean and Cheese please. She said NO you can only have beef! WTF! I explained that I always order the same and that it doesn't make sense to ask me then tell me I can only have ____? ANyway slow service. Crabby clerk. You lost my business MR. Berto. Adios"}
{"text":"The food at this location is the worst filibertos food I've tasted in the valley!  My bacon, egg, and cheese burrito had just one piece of bacon and no cheese.  The entire burrito was burnt egg, and was disgusting."}
{"text":"I was pleasantly surprised at the quality of my Carne Asada burrito. The meat was exceptional, and void of any gristle / fat / or chewy low quality beef cuts. The taste was great too, and the size for the money makes sense to me.  Even though they are a chain, it's good to see consistency and quality in their dishes ; and I commend them for having the best \"fast\" Mexican food in the valley."}
{"text":"As a carefree local I decided to try this joint as it just opened. Decided to try the basic 2 beef tacos because if you can't get that right your in trouble. After one bite I tossed it in the garbage. It was if they deep fried the shell and meat then threw on the toppings. Now if this wasn't bad enough within minutes after having that one bit I started feeling sick. 

How hard is it to make a great taco? Plus they charge extra for chips and salsa? I really hate to give bad reviews but this joint doesn't even deserve one star. 

I give this place z3 months tops before it shutters it's doors unless they start serving food the way it should be made. Truthfully the tacos at Jack in the box are better."}
{"text":"The two meals I've had of been delicious the enchiladas and the tacos combo.  Nice big portions of rice and refried beans with the combos. I will definitely be going back. Such a quick and easy drive through."}
{"text":"Awesome place! You won't be disappointed. The employees are sweet, especially the lady in the drive through!"}
{"text":"Half ass place for full price, do yourself a solid, there is a McDonald's in the same plaza. They got the same quality food but McDonald's got normal prices. Look how these fuckers put one little piece of chicken barely any cheese and no lettuce. This Filiberto's sucks go to any other one it's worth the drive and gas."}
{"text":"It seems like I'm always ordering the breakfast burritos when I come here. I wish I would change it up sometimes but they're so hard to pass up when I'm craving Filly B's!"}
{"text":"I ordered the Carne Asada fries with Beans, it was well served. All the ingredients was cooked just right, and the flavor was delicious. Will be returning."}
{"text":"Excellent food. They keep the place uncomfortably cold.  Tuesday taco night is packed with low class clientele."}
{"text":"Sorry, my stomach and I have a tenacious relationship as it is. This Filiberto's did not help any.

My digestive tract is now suing me for damages.

2 stars because it costs like no money but that's about it. You're better off buying a tortilla and filling it with beans yourself from Food City down the road."}
{"text":"I really wish I could give  these guys more stars, because the food is decent relevant to the price.
But the atmosphere is just sooooo crappy.
I understand that it's a Mexican restaurant but, but the TV blaring Mexican soap operas, The lighting and the general feel of the inside is just awful."}
{"text":"I've eaten at plenty of Fili B's, but this one takes the cake.

As a general rule, Filiberto's makes delicious food in heaping portions for relatively no money.  I'm sure there's millions of calories in it, I don't care.  I recommend the Carne Asada Steak Fries.

What set's this one apart from the rest is their service.  A good friend of mine owns a private bar a three minute walk from this Filibertos, and we generally stumble through their drive-through on foot between the hours of 3 and 5 in the morning on our designated drinking day.  The first time we did this I was 100% positive that we were going to get shut down, but the owner of the bar said he does it all the time and they don't mind.  We tried to get the car sensor at the menu to work but we couldn't get it to register us, so we went up and knocked on the window.  I, even in my inebriated state was mortified at the notion that we were about to get told off by a Filiberto's drive-through worker, however, the lady running it just smiled at us and asked what she could get for us.

Awesome.  I go here just about every week on foot and they always serve me with a smile.  A smile that I don't get when I go through in my car, come to think of it."}
{"text":"Not only is the menu something new to Buckeye, but also very delicious! They also have Victoria on tap!  There is something for everyone on the menu, this is a must try!!!"}
{"text":"Ok, so where do I start...I am new to the valley, and was asking around about a good Mexican restaurant in the area. I think I had about five different people recommend this place called \"Filiberto's\". When I asked what this place was like, I got the same answer from each person, \"dude, it's like Mexican fast food, but way better than taco bell!\". Well me being from California, where authentic Mexican places are on every corner, I was sceptical to say the least. So on Oct 29, I finally decided to go check this place out for myself.
I ordered the #19-chicken burrito, chicken enchilada, rice, and beans (w/no tomatoes). It probably took four minutes from order time until I got my order, very fast. I was very pessimistic at this point about how the quality of this food was going to be. To my surprise,when I opened the box everything was very neat and presentable, and looked delish. 
 I started out by pouring some hot sauce on top of the whole meal and then I dug in. The burrito was big, but not intimidating, and the chicken was very moist. The burrito had a good mixture of rice,beans and chicken. The enchilada was smothered in sauce with lettuce and cheese on top, in a corn tortilla. It was very moist and the sauce they used was awesome. They gave me a large portion of re-fried beans with melted cheese on top. Last was the rice, normally I am not a big fan of Mexican style rice, but this rice was soooo good, not overpowered with spices, just right.
 Overall Filiberto's is an awesome joint, it's cheap,fast, and delicious. It's a no frills, authentic Mexican fast food spot, you cant really ask for much more. I'm glad I was advised to go to Filiberto's and I will definitely recommend it to other people."}
{"text":"Sorry Filiberto's .... never coming back to this joint...... guess what never got to eat your food. I stood waiting to order for 20 - 30 min .... no one was in there.. I called out if anyone was there and no answer.. nobody in or out this joint? Anyways thanks for the great service... me coming back ? , me don't think so...... !!"}
{"text":"Hadn't been here in a while, but popped in on a saturday night.  It was rainy, so there wasn't a wait time and there were two young guys working at the time.  I ordered a simple bean burrito without cheese and side order of fries.  When I pulled up to the counter, I paid.  And then the kid asked me if I wanted extra cheese on that burrito.  I smiled and said that it was no cheese please.  And he says, \"oh, ok.\"  He had a smirk, I should have known.  

Sure enough.  Not only cheese on the burrito but, on the fries too.  Funny!   Obviously it was a joke to them..  Anybody that messes with your food and thinks its funny is obviously just a little punk @$$ B!%C#.   I'd never trust anything coming out of there again.  My last stop to this place.  I didn't even bother with trying to go back and get it fixed, I just threw it away.   Instead, I'll just let everybody know my experience and you can make your own informed choice."}
{"text":"I give it five stars just because the tacos are bomb and they got all the mexican drinks like pina, horchata Jamaica ,lemon, and tamadino... The tacos they put pica de gayo and qucomole and they are BIG .."}
{"text":"Very good and seasoned I like this place , I'll continue to return , there even open for breakfast."}
{"text":"We love this Filibertos. Their daily specials are a great deal. Food is cooked to order, fast and delicious.  The staff is always friendly and always helpful in ordering. 

Our favorites are the Wednesday chimichanga special plate and the Adobada burrito."}
{"text":"The food is alright.  It doesn't really stand out from their local competition.   Their prices have been getting higher.  They only seem worth going to when they run coupons for buy one get one free.  They used to have country breakfast burritos for $1.99 every morning.   Now you only get that by coupon after making a purchase and it's only good for 1.  Sometimes they are quick, other times not.  It is really hit and miss.  One thing they have going for them is the included guacamole in the pollo asado and carne asada burritos."}
{"text":"Big Juan is awesome with the bacon and packed really well, it was a foot long burrito but last couple times I went for that it has been normal burrito length but still packed well.."}
{"text":"I go here often. Good food, good portions, and sorta kinda cheap. I recommend the #19 combo, but ask for chicken. Most of the employees at the window speak at least broken English too, this is a plus. All in all, good experience. 


Ask for bumper stickers too if you want, they usually have them."}
{"text":"Yuck, yuck. Dirty place and food is always tasting a little \"weird.\" I have tried this place again and again because it is right by my house, but rarely do I actually enjoy what I get.. Many times tortillas taste old and stale and the chile relleno is filled in grease. I would say their specials are a great price, but food just isn't. I'd recommend trying Ritas across the street first"}
{"text":"This is best fast mexican food in buckey. I almost die when i had first time. It was soooooooo good that i had for breakfast next morning. It is best. I would suggest to everybody I know. But i dont know many people. I was super surprised by service. It made me happy for the rest of the day. I love all of food there."}
{"text":"Good food made to order.

Great staff. Love this place. Burritos are heavy.
Highly recommend."}
{"text":"Came here on my lunch break for a simple $5 meal. I waited in the drive thru for no less than 20 minutes. The last five minutes of waiting took place AFTER I had finally paid. TOO SLOW!!! You would think in all that time I would get my meal the way I asked, without lettuce. But they actually went and put extra lettuce. So rediculous. Never had problems at this Fili B's before until today. Not going back."}
{"text":"Update - called the store they gave me a credit however lady who answered the phone taking my information started laughing while on the phone with her. I let her know it's kinda rude to do that when the customer on the phone is frustrated. She said she wasn't laughing about the situation, but because she dropped a spoon??? I let her know it's still rude. Officially not going back. 

Original post- Asked for a burrito, NO cheese, lady taking my order even repeated right. Burrito ended up having cheese....so frustrated as I picked these up on my way out of town and couldn't turn back due to on the job."}
{"text":"Filibertos on 35th Ave & Northern. ......Terrible.

Went and ordered $35.00 worth of food.......eggs were burnt, meat is tough.  Oh, and not to mention EGG shells found in the food!!  ABSOLUTELY disgusting!!  We will never eat there again, worst part about it is I live across the street......we will continue to go to the one on Cave Creek and Cactus.  They are absolutely the best.... owners, crew and food is well worth the 10 mile drive."}
{"text":"if I could give no star I would. So after my last disgusting visit I tried again on Tuesday after work. I really do want this place to be good because I have had good food and service before. Well, what can I say? It definitely was cleaner but still not great.The trash can was cleaner but still stained with red goo down it. Good Lord, buy a decent trash already.  I went in for Taco Tuesday which is 99cent tacos. So I order, and my total comes to $5-something. So I ask the girl why its almost $6 for 4 tacos. She points to the sign and yes there are new signs with a price increase. Okay, no problem, whatever. I tell her that for almost $6 I would rather have the carne asada burrito. Nobody was doing anything at that point (cooks) and she just looked at me for a second and said ya. YA?? What is that all about? Whatever at this point. So I get my food and it is by far the worst tacos I have ever had there in over two years. Nothing in them and extra greasy crap dripping all over. Well I guess if there is not too much in them, you basically get a grease soaked shell. So disgusting. I am done with this place and maybe if they get their crap together I will go back. No big loss."}
{"text":"Love love love 
On the weekends you can get MENUDO. There are cheaper places to get a good carne asada burrito. But I prefer this one. The taquitos are also very good."}
{"text":"Thought I would stop in for a cheap meal and was shocked at their prices.  $8.99 for my  loaded Nachos?  Then I get them and there is barely any cheese and it's not even melted!!!!  Then I go to refill my watered down Horchata and I'm told that they do not give free refills! Filibertos, sorry but we will NOT be returning. If I want better food with my cheese actually melted I'll go up the road to Cafe Rio and I get free Horchata refills there too.  Oh and Fresh Homemade tortillas.  Then if I want really tasty food and have more time, I'll go across the street to Isabel Amor and have an Amazing meal.  Oh and their Tortas are served with actual Avocado, not runny so called Guacamole.  They're only .50 cents more than yours also.  

Step it up and put your menu where it belongs.  Maybe a $5 nacho and offer Free Horchata Refill"}
{"text":"This place is a sick joke. I ordered a carne asada burrito to go, and I didn't think to open the burrito and inspect it. 
After I left and began to eat it I saw the it was filled with meat. ONLY MEAT. No rice, beans, or anything else at all. I was so pissed off, I wanted to go back but I was already too far to turn around. What in their right mind would make them think that I wanted to eat a pound of meat wrapped in a tortilla?"}
{"text":"I hate to give any place a low rating but getting ripped off is NOT ok so I suppose if they even care, they're lucky getting 2 instead of 1 ~ even though we WON'T b back!! Filibertos used 2 b the place that any other fill~in~the~blank: berto's tried 2 imit8. Gone r the days of nice ample portions 4 decent prices & quite frankly I haven't really considered them Filiberto's 4 awhile now... more like fill~their~pockets while giving u the shaft. 

   Burritos u can expect 2 b mostly tortilla/hardly any filling & if they were @ least longer & skimpy or stumpy but fat it might b ok, but here we go again w/ another drive~ thru mexican place that's cutting corners & charging more 4 less in quality, ingredients, quantity & don't even get me started on the so~called service aspect. (more complete lack~there~of). 

   Order & get charged 4 a Large Pina & discover it's water results in them looking @ u crazy like ur trying 2 get something 4 free when u tell them. Uhm, no just would like 2 get something close 2 what I ordered & paid 4. And speaking of water... red & green sauce cups r 1/2 filled & mostly water w/ color & little flavoring & they just love throwing them in ur bag on top of whatever u order so it gets all over the place & satur8es napkins (if they even include them) cuz they don't secure the cheap lids, even when u ask 4 them in a seper8 bag. Yeah, they understood me (I've asked both in English & in Spanish). Yes a 'gringa' can talk Spanish fluently... ;-p

   And I really don't get why a \"drive~thru\" can take SOooo Long when u discover there's nowhere near the food in ur bag that Filiberto's used 2 b famous 4. As I've said b4, if any place inevitably increases their prices as often will b the case, @ least let it b equivalent 2 what it was b4. Also when a Veg~head orders the very limited items we have 2 choose from & almost every time finds some meat that somehow managed 2 b in their pl8 or burrito, that's a Huge EWWW!!  So will we ever c Fili(F*ck)tards again? Best Amy Winehouse voice echoes No, no, NO!!!"}
{"text":"Fast service, the food was delicious, and restaurant was clean, and plenty of parking."}
{"text":"Love the taquitos here... rice and beans were good, too. Great prices, quick service, awesome staff."}
{"text":"Very clean , the owners are very nice and I was so happy with the way they handled a concern I have - the reason for 5 stars is because of the way they handled themselves...    and Every time I go in the staff is so friendly... they have a Repeat Customer in me!!"}
{"text":"Love the chimichanga here. On wednesday,they had it for only $5.99 with drinks. Also,they have awesome sauce that are to die for. We look forward going here everytime we go to the zoo."}
{"text":"Hubby and i didn't expect the taste of the food we ordered here. We had the chimichangga plate and adobada plate. Both were really excellent but the adobada stands out the most that we ordered a second one. We will definitely go back."}
{"text":"I've been here a few times as it seems more authentic than Chipotle or Taco Bell.  The food is fairly disappointing though - very stodgy and not very fresh.

On my last visit I came away with awful food poisoning.  It took me two days in bed and a $155 doctor's bill to recover.  Needless to say in future I'll be going to Chipotle instead."}
{"text":"This place sucks so bad. This is the third time I've had an issue with my order I regret that I went back. This is it never going back. They charged us for guacamole and didn't even put it in the burrito..we asked them to cut the burritos in half...they didn't even do that. It was not busy I was the only customer in the drive through so there is no excuse. Also the food was luke warm..the whole thing was just EW."}
{"text":"We were staying at a nearby hotel and arrived late, so most restaurants were already closed. Front desk guy recommended Filiberto's down the street as they are open 24 hours. Place looked divey. You place your order outside, and people at the drive through are right there too, placing their orders. I honestly was afraid to get food poisoning.  My husband wanted to try it though, and nothing else was open. They have indoor seats and you pick your food up from the window inside. Portions were very big and, surprisingly, food was good. I had a chicken quesadilla. It is 24 hours later and no food poisoning,  so I guess it was safe. I would probably not eat there again though. Only giving 3 stars as food was above expectations."}
{"text":"Everything is a scam my wife told don't go back I should have listened. They post all of this Happy Hour stuff when the check comes its either the wrong item or the wrong day then they blamed it on the supplier for printing the wrong cards. You order something from the menu the check comes its a different price there excuse is we forgot to change the menu price. You have to pay what the check says. You talk with the manager he just says there's nothing he can do.  I am still waiting for a credit for a double charge I think the only way I'll ever see it is if I dispute it with my bank."}
{"text":"I stopped by Filberto's in the morning after seeing a hotel clerk with a bag of their burritos. The burritos themselves are a bit expensive, around $5.99 or $6.99 depending on what you get. I got the breakfast burrito and the bacon burrito. Despite being on the expensive side, as a on-the-go food I was VERY satisfied. They don't skimp on the contents. There was a lot of eggs, very hot and delicious meats, and a nice sprinkle of cheese that happily fulfilled every breakfast burrito craving I had. I haven't experienced the in-dining, but as far as their breakfast burrito drive-thru is concerned, I'd recommend it."}
{"text":"Arizona burrito, with sour cream and about 6 cups filled with the green hot sauce.  

That's all I have to say about that.  So good.....sooooo gooood....."}
{"text":"This place has great service and great delicious food! Prices are very good as well! My husband and I really recommend this Filibertos!"}
{"text":"Ordered the super nachos & large drink. Free refills which I like, and they have a chip and salsa bar. They have about 5 different kinds, also has the spicy carrots, limes & cut up cucumber. Lady was nice, order came out quick & the chef wash his hands before he made the food. That's 5 stars in my book."}
{"text":"Phenomenal food, great coupons and a grade A+ customer service experience. Ask for Victoria!"}
{"text":"Best location when it comes to filibertos. Fast good food, my every Wednesday meal for sure! :)"}
{"text":"This is one of the good Filbertos but the girl behind the counter is an idiot. 95% of the time we call in ahead and she messes up the order. It's the 6' tall 250lb lady that does this. Also if you use the FRYs coupon there, she wants to only use the $1 off instead of the 20%. When you spend $50-60 on an order the 20% is better. 

The food is good and always ready fast. 5 stars for the food but 1 star off for the lady's service and inability to get my order right."}
{"text":"Third time here. They have a salsa bar with chips. Only there are no chips and many of the salsas are out. Although they will sell you chips they wont refill the station with chips,takes too long to cook, or salsa. Apparently because they close in an hour. There has been a stream of customers and three of six table are occupied. We like it here, it's our Tuesday stop in, but we won't come again if it doesn't have the reasons we like it. Chip and salsa bar and good food, although the shredded beef taco was cold and soggy everything else was good including the chip we purchased. Had to do without green salsa and hot carrots."}
{"text":"It was better than Julioberto's (although they are basically the same thing), but I was still fairly unimpressed. The prices were also ridiculous for what you get. For what we paid we should have just gone to Chipotle, which I find to be much better. I got two burritos here and I was able to make my plate last for two meals, but the food was just OK. The drive thru also takes forever, which was irritating."}
{"text":"Great mexican fast food.  The chicken taco combo is great but on this particular day, it was pretty hot.  The breakfast burritos  are awesome.  The rolled tacos could really use some lettuce.  Come on people."}
{"text":"I used the drive-through. 
The guy forgot to run my coupon so he gave me a free large drink instead awesome trade I think!
Good service and greasy Mexican food."}
{"text":"Food is horrible too many good Mexican restaurants in this area but this one is far from it"}
{"text":"I'd give this drive-thru place 2.5 stars if I could because it\"s better than \"Meh!\" but not quite \"A-OK.\" The generous filling of the overstuffed chicken and steak tacos was delicious, BUT the small soft tortillas were very flimsy and fell apart immediately. And their hot sauce was the least interesting I've ever tasted. There are a couple of picnic tables outside, but they looked kind of dirty. I wouldn't try to eat their tacos in your car. Way too messy, and they didn't even bother to throw plastic utensils in the bag."}
{"text":"Great Carne Asada burrito. Been here many times and burritos are out of this world. All meat, no fillers as in beans and rice. Does come with pico and guac! So juicy and flavorful, that it does not even need hot sauce on it. 

As a long distance truck driver , I stop by here every time i am in the Phoenix metro area. There is a small Quik Tip truck stop right next door. Usually fill up with diesel and then a great burrito. Wish I had one of these back in PA. 

Have been to many burrito joints across America. Hands down , this place is a winner !
Locals get here. Tourists get here. Everybody get here. Who's with me ??? Go Go Go"}
{"text":"I have had take out here multiple times. The food is always very good. I have never had a bad experience. I suggest the chili rellenos, green chile pork, carne asada, chorizo burros and especially the shredded beef tacos. The rice and beans are great as well!  Thanks filis!!"}
{"text":"This restaurant has some of the rudest, and unprofessional customer service. I have given this spot a try on different occasions just to confirm that my experience is always completely ruined. This is such a bummer because the food here is actually pretty decent but the horrible treatment I get keeps me from coming here. The staff is unfriendly, unkind, rude and unmotivated. I would never recommend this place to any of my friends or family."}
{"text":"My husband can't survive without Filiberto's breakfast burritos. I like their chicken taco salad and the tortas (sandwiches).
Oh, and of course, their tamarindo juice is the best."}
{"text":"Yet again, you let me down with your terrible customer service, filibertos. Waited in the drive thru for 10 minutes before I had to drive up to the window to have my order taken.  Aaaand I got beans when I said PLEASE, no beans :/"}
{"text":"terrible tacos... i ordered two regular chicken tacos and it was all chicken an no fillings... you could tell the chicken pieces were scraps, they were chewy and hard. 
I won't be eating here again!"}
{"text":"Holy cow best breakfast burro ever and I've had tons of them.
Thing was so full and massive i has 3 meals out of it!
Quick service"}
{"text":"OK even us foodies and health nuts get caught out there hungry and no where good to go late at night. That is if you think 9pm is late.  So you find yourself subjected to second rate food at fast food places.  This is really when I start to get homesick for the Big Apple. You can still get great food past 9pm even if it is cheap and fast in NYC.  

When I moved from NY almost 4 years ago, the fact that Mexican food was so abundant here was enough to have me salivating on a regular basis.  Not just any Mexican food but the REAL thing.  Yippee for my move.  Great Mexican food here I come.  So I decided to get the consensus from people and I kept hearing about Filiberto's.  OK not hard to find they are sprinkled all over the valley.  Late one night I end up in the drive through of Filibierto's in East Mesa.  I really can not remembered what I ordered but I do remember it being awful.  I chalk it up to late night cooks.  Hey who wants to make tacos at 1am? My next encounter is lunch rush in Tempe.  Eh nothing to write home about.  

I have frequented different locations and still nada.  There is one item that I do like, the bean tostada.  But honestly how can you mess up a bean tostada?  Tonight I decided to live on the edge, ordering my usual AND a side of guacamole.  Hey, this is a Mexican restaurant the guacamole has to be good...NOT.  It was bland, too creamy and just down right YUCK.  That was the last straw for me.  

If you are stuck in the wee hours of the night and you must have Mexican food then at your own risk go to Filiberto's.  I would rather take my chances with Taco-Bell."}
{"text":"I need a 1/2 star additional. This Filbertos food is good. It is what it is & good. I've had a handful of experiences since it's opening & have had some decent burritos & rolled tacos. Having said that I've never eaten inside because at lunch time it's filled with teens from the local HS. No offense to the teens, I was one, once. There just isn't space. So this is based on the food which was fine but it's the drive thru \"service\". The same woman working the window each time. 1) she has some trouble understanding the orders. Always have to repeat it. 2) makes mistakes 3 out of 5 visits to the orders. 3) spilled soda on me, my car & clothes because the lid wasn't on well. So you know with Styrofoam what's gonna happen. You pick it up or in this case it's passed to you & it comes out. So instead of saying sorry she says \"you took it wrong\" then a half hearted I'm sorry. Then do you need some napkins?
So needless to say I'm not a fan of her idea of service. 4) When I called to complain about the 3rd food order being wrong (no guac on the rolled tacos that I paid for the guac on) instead of offering me a side of guac or God forbid free rolled tacos I get a complacent I'm sorry. So unfortunately I gave this place too many chances & now am just not going there again. There are too many Mexican food options that get it right to put up with this place."}
{"text":"I have traveled far and wide across this great nation, and nowhere compares to Phoenix when it comes to cheap, fast, and delicious Mexican food.

The chile relleno burrito at Filiberto's is a case study in why.  A breaded and fried chile stuffed with cheese and drowned in guacamole and pico de gallo, wrapped in a warm, soft tortilla that tastes fresh off the stone - ignoring cholesterol and fat, what could be wrong with that?  Drown it down with a sweet cup of horchata, and you have entered post-drunk, pre-dreamland nirvana.

For meat lovers, the carne asada is yummy, but I think my favorite is the patròn burrito.

Also, Filly B's doesn't use lard in their beans, which makes it a go-to place for my vegan friends when hunger strikes at two in the morning.

If you want fine cuisine, go to the Barrio Cafe and be prepared to pay for it.  if you want delicious and equally authentic Mexican food, visit Filly's, any time.  There's a reason there's a line for breakfast burritos at five in the morning.

Also, a veteran's tip - avoid the drive-thru and go inside, if you can.  Even if you are ordering your food to go.  Trust me.  A Filiberto's drive-thru line is a place where time ceases to have meaning and the fourth dimension gets clogged."}
{"text":"i always have made good reviews for  filly 'bs  but stay away from this one,went in for some rolled tacos thursday nite,watched the cook cut RAW meat on the same cutting board  and use the same gloves to make a burrito for some poor soul going thru the drive in he actually put the tortilla right on the exact spot where the meat was   then it was my turn  he took my tacos out of the fryer without tongs   and he used the same gloves as before   then to make matters worse he stuck his hand in the cheese and put it on  the tacos. When i said to him  do you know what you did    he  new  then proceeded to  say i wiill put some new gloves on and make you  some more but i told him you contaminated the cheese you going to get rid of all that cheese? he said ?     do you think he has been trained how to handle food   ? does he  have  a card?(food card )  sorry  filly b's   that mistake could  get someone real sick"}
{"text":"THEY FREAKING HAVE ROACHES!!! No joke, one was in my friend's tacos when she opened her food and ran across the table while eating there!!! F*cking disgusting!!!"}
{"text":"This place is too disgusting. The only good part about my visit was leaving. The broad working the counter was very unpleasant and seemed to hate life. I got my food, a carnitas taco and huevos rancheros, and was too scared to eat it. I had never seen carnitas like this before. It was just cubes of pork that looked like they had been pan fried. All the food on the huevos rancheros plate looked really old. I went ahead and threw it all in the garbage. The restaurant itself is really run down and smells like mildew and mold. I should have known better."}
{"text":"The food was ok, but for a filibertos it was not up to the usual quality. The place is a little dirty with dust every where on the ceilings and that is a turn off."}
{"text":"So like an idiot I came back after having had rotten food the previous time.  This time, I came because it was Taco Tuesday, and the tacos at Filiberto's were only 99 cents.  The chicken taco was acceptable although I have had better tacos at Del Taco and Taco Bell, which is pretty pathetic.  The beef taco was disgusting, the beef was dried up and greasy.  After one bite, I opened up the taco and saw that there was barely any meat in it.  

NEVER GOING BACK!"}
{"text":"Worst Filberto's in Arizona. Food tastes like shit and the staff sucks. Go to the one on Val Vista & Baseline, the staff there is nice and they actually know how to cook the food."}
{"text":"I have been eating here (and other locations) for 15 years and the food is top notch!!! Carne Asada burrito, no need to look any further on the menu!!!"}
{"text":"Oh My God.  Was this disgusting.  Been eating at various Filibertos for years but this place was totally gross.  2 beef tacos and some rolled tacos with guac.  The guac was grey.  The meat in the rolled tacos was still frozen.  The beef tacos were dripping grease and way under cooked.  I understand how this location had 2 stars. 

Stay away from this location."}
{"text":"Food poisoned. Trip the hospital. Needless to say I'll never be eating here again."}
{"text":"Yes, I do love Filibertos.  Yes I do !!!

I first ate at one of their stores in Albuquerque.  It was on the east side on Eubank and Constitution.  Wow, it was so awesome.  But back then, Phoenix seemed so far away.  I had never been there (here) and it was like a distant dream.  And, New Mexico is really a sweet, sweet place to be and live.

Anyway - I did come to Phoenix and now I live here in Mesa.  Fortunately, there is a Filiberto's right around the corner so to speak, on Southern.  I love this one, it is my favorite in all the valley.  So delicious and I have never been disappointed in any meal I got here.

Ok, so some people may complain about the 'service.'  What service??  it's a drive through.  There is no service except a couple of really busy guys trying to get through all the orders of people backed up in trucks, cars and standing there on foot in the 112 degree heat.  So, no.  There is no 'service.'  But, there is really good food at very decent prices.  I have to limit myself to once a month because I get a python effect, it takes me about a day to digest my way through a good meal.  I am like a dog tho, and if I didn't control myself I would be eating here every day."}
{"text":"Carne Asada burrito was horrible. Steak tasted old and dry. Better off going to taco bell.  Never going back."}
{"text":"What the hell is going on with this location?  You heard what I said in my last review and probably know by now that I don't trust the burritos anymore.  That's established.  I've been ordering tacos, rolled tacos and nachos since then and they've been fairly decent (besides the occasional chicken leg tendon in my taco ).  The service is fine, but now it's the little cups of red and green salsa that are pissing me off.  Inconsistent, underseasoned, watery and weak... it's disgusting.  I feel like this location doesn't give a flyin fuck anymore, and on top of that, there were health code violations that I'm hearing about after the fact.  I'm gonna have to drive a couple miles down the road to the location at 35th Ave and Southern.  I hope they can do better than this when it comes to the quality of the food.  If not, then I guess I'm done with Filiberto's."}
{"text":"Finally a Filiberto's around the corner from the house. I was a little worried because of the 1 star review, fortunately when I went it was your typical Fili goodness!"}
{"text":"I went to this location and got the two chicken taco meal. I was very disappointed to find that the taco shells where the pre-made kind. The food over all was decent, but all I could think was that I was paying for over priced Taco Bell. I don't think I will being going back here. I'll just stick with my knock-offs for now on. They have yet to disappoint."}
{"text":"The customer service here SUCKS! They've messed up orders. I've gone back in to get the things they've missed, and they look at you like what do you want me to do. In the drive thru, they don't ask what you want with your order, they just toss you your order and close the window. This used to be one of the best locations."}
{"text":"Worst customer service everrrrrrr!!! Every time we go they are always rude, try to rush you to order, and have no manners. Well on the upside the food is always delicious and fresh."}
{"text":"Glad they are back open! We live in the neighborhood and rode our bikes up for breakfast. Very clean, new furniture, friendly staff, good food, try them out. They have a delicious chipotle mayo sauce on the salsa bar. I put it on everything! Will be back for sure!"}
{"text":"That was the most disgusting thing you call a taco I have ever had.  Went to the taco Tuesday.  Ordered four, what a mistake.  Lettuce and hard shell, this is gringo food. Triple yuck"}
{"text":"35th and Southern is a major improvement over 51st and Baseline.  Each time I've come to this location I get hot, fresh, consistent food.  The salsa is the same every time: delicious. It seems to me like the staff at this location cares more, that's always a good thing. I don't mind driving an extra couple of miles as long as I know my food's gonna be right and nobody's trying to give me attitude!"}
{"text":"Worst Filiberto's around and that should tell you enough. They use old McDonald's fries for potatoes."}
{"text":"I like filabertos but this location seems a little off. Doesn't taste fresh or something. Just not the same as others I've been to."}
{"text":"Food always fresh and clean . Every Time I come in to eat I have never have a complaint. The place always looks clean when you walk in and also the employees are nice"}
{"text":"The Arizona burrito is so good and the employees are fantastic!! The good thing to is that it's open 24/7 and the food is always good. The green salsa they have is delicious! If only they had some pineapple water haha"}
{"text":"Went here looking forward to an awesome Filiberto's breakfast burrito and instead got something that tasted like it was from Taco Bell. The potatoes were obviously the frozen kind and the chorizo was subpar. They didn't even get the horchata right, too sweet. Won't be visiting again. 

Pro: drive-thru was pretty quick."}
{"text":"Not bad, a lot of food for a good price.  The food is pretty bland, but that's what the red and green sauce are for, get extra.

I have to agree with \"Kimberley M.\", about this place stays open because of drunk people, 10 years ago I was that 'drunk person' and this place was a beautiful thing."}
{"text":"This place is kind of gross, however it hits the spot when you may be craving greasy mexican food that is cheap.  Stay away from the guacamole though as it is pretty gross."}
{"text":"wow.  used to so much like the ones by us in central phx
 expected so much more.  no chips, you have to pay for them.  no marinated carrots, you have to pay for them.  poor customer service young girl started an attitude when we brought these questions up to her.  tea was out.  cashier kept disappearing in the back and kept us waiting every time we asked for something that we expected to be offered in all the other fillibertos. we should have taken a hint when the parking lot was empty at 5pm"}
{"text":"Finally after a year in Phoenix and hearing about Filibertos I pulled  in. Honestly I literally walked in and walked out and then walked back in again and I'm glad I walked back in because the super nachos I ordered were the highlight of my evening. Now this place is not a fancy upscale establishment but is a welcoming place with a homey feel and I will return."}
{"text":"Love this place! I work across the street and it's so convenient! This place is fast when it comes to taking big orders! And I know! I come in with large orders for my business all the time. Especially for breakfast! Yum! I would definitely recommend this place to anyone who enjoys Mexican food for sure! It's always my guilty pleasure and I will always be sure to keep my business coming back. Highly highly satisfied!"}
{"text":"I only eat cheese enchilada only now. I can't eat the meat since the one that got busted with cats in the freezer so many years back.  Sorry morris for all those drunk nights of chow down."}
{"text":"Greasy good though still good for a drunk girl.  $9 for a quesadilla is to much!

Also, their drive thru sucks!  It is faster to go inside then thru the drive thru where a 16 yr old working & not know what to do."}
{"text":"Got here. Ordered food. One order was a combo meal that came with a cup/drink. Wanted horchata. They wanted an extra $3.04 yet the combo came with a drink. Ok whatever. Went to the salsa bar and saw a sign posted that reads, \"receive one free item by showing us your rating to any of our cashiers. Items include 1 fountain drink or Mexican juice of any size.\" I asked the cashier if horchata was a Mexican juice. They acknowledged that it was. I asked about submitting a review for the drink. They said they won't honor the sign they put up."}
{"text":"Out of all the Filiberto's this one has always been the one either messing orders up, or food being cold and not fresh. For being always open it hardly is ever full with people inside or with cars in line at the drive thru. Definitely not coming back and not recommending to friends or others. Maybe consider driving to Bethany Home & I-17 or 43rd Ave & Camelback."}
{"text":"I love this place. We eat here all the time and have never had a problem. Always willing to do special orders.. patient with us changing eveything and adding and taking off different things.. Most of the staff is nice.. the overnight guys are awesome.. even know my order when i pull up. Will continue to visit here when i get the taste for decent mexican food!!!"}
{"text":"This is based off my one experience here. Came on a weekday in the afternoon through the drive-thru. The menu listed everything. The place is open 24/7. Ordered the carne asada fries and it was yummy. Authentic. Fast food. Fries. Carne asada. Hot! Hot! Hot!"}
{"text":"Terrible service. Staff claims they have no manager & can do whatever they want. Got horrible product the last 3 times. Was told by \"Elizabeth\" at southern & Dobson. that I could come back for replacement but got there 3 days later & told no way! 
Very rude!"}
{"text":"Taco Tuesday is my Favorite!!!! Always Great and Open Late!!!"}
{"text":"Your typical bland Filiberto's, but it's always open to rescue you when the late night munchies/Mexican cravings hit. My favorite day is still Tuesday when you can get a beef or chicken taco for 99 cents. This location is a bit cleaner than others I've seen but it's still the same mediocre food joint. I wish their hot sauce was hotter."}
{"text":"Probably one of the best fixes for Carne Asada fries/burritos in AZ. The best thing about this place is that it is open 24 hours and food is freshly made."}
{"text":"This was my first visit to the new location and I have to say it was a good overall experience. Service was fast and the food was delicious. The burritos are massive. I will visit again for sure."}
{"text":"Filibi's is the BEST! Came here all the time with my best friends for a reliably great meal. Obviously, some say come post 2am after a good night out but I say you can come anytime - early morning, lunch, afternoon snack, dinner, pretty much any time of day or night. My favorites:

Custom Order: Bean & Cheese Burrito with lettuce, tomato and sour cream inside the burrito made enchilada style (man my mouth is watering thinking about it!)

I also like the nacho's and quesadillas...and if you are really hungry their chimichunga's are great too. Rice is good but only when doused with their awesome hot salsa! For me, its a must visit every time I come back to AZ."}
{"text":"Just tried to eat lunch here. I came in the store and an employee (who must have been on his break) walked back and forth between eating in the dining area and walking back behind the counter. Another employee in the back saw me and did not come out to take my order. After standing there for several minutes of not even being acknowledged, I went across the street to get my lunch. They obviously don't care if they get your business."}
{"text":"I've wanted to comment on this restaurant for some time now. And now that I finally setup an account, I will. It all started when I used the drive- thru. I picked out my order, but I was charged more than the price on the board. They claimed \"there was a price change\". Fine, then update the board. Strike one!  I tried again another day (kind of addicted to Mexican food). The drive-thru again. This time my meal was fine, by but they forgot to give me plastic wear or napkins. That was great, because I ate at a park, with fingers. Strike two!  Finally, I gave them one more opportunity. Drive- thru again. I had my 4 year old son and asked for a small cup of water. They said \"we don't have any cups\".  I could see cups through the window. I asked if I could have one of those. \"Nope!\", was the response. Strike 3!  If you feel you must go here, maybe best advice is don't use the drive-thru. I won't be back, as there are better options nearby."}
{"text":"I Love Filly-B's! The food is great! It is cheap! Open 24 hours! you can't ask for more! The food is be horrible to my heath! I am surprised i have not gotten violently sick from eating there!  But i am willing to take that risk when i eat at Filibertos! If you get hungry and night and nothing else is open Fillys is the place to go! I feel like crap every time i eat there but it is 100% worth it!"}
{"text":"I will never come back to this location I ordered a Carne Asada burrito that cost $5.99 and every other piece of meat was a piece of fat.I asked for the meat to be well done they couldn't even do that. I have ordered tacos from here before and they are very greasy with very little meat. This is my third time trying this place and I am so disappointed.  I can't believe that they charge $8.99 for a super nacho-chips some meat and beans I don't think so!"}
{"text":"Every single time we get food from this location our order is WRONG! We have ordered through delivery and have gone through drive thru our order is always incorrect  .Staff is rude, quality of food is only good half the time.. this morning will be our last time.."}
{"text":"Ordered menudo to go on May 26. I got home start eating next thing I realize there's two big piece of the pork stomach? And three small bite size which it should've been bite size anyways! Waste of money and will never return to this location"}
{"text":"Awful service. Sat and waited at the drive thru speaker for several min . my order was not taken. So I pulled around to the window . again no one appeared. Finally looked up the number and called the store to have my order taken. The clerk was not even apologetic at all for the delay. When I asked for a manager, there wasn't one. Waited entirely too long for sub par food"}
{"text":"I like Filiberto's Mexican restaurants, but this is the worst. I've been here twice and it's been crappy both times.  This time, none of the cheese on any dish was melted, including the cheese in the enchiladas."}
{"text":"They are quick, well as quick as a Mexican restaurant can be via a drive thru window. I really enjoy the burritos here. I had the Fajitas once. A little disappointed that you pay so much and you don't even get a drink.. Only main issue I have with this place is every time I have gone here I get a side of Guac, just hoping that since its a Mexican restaurant it will one of these visits taste good. But it never does, Its almost like they keep it to long or use bad avocado's to start with because it always taste rotten. Has almost completely turned me off of Guac all together. But if you just get the steak burrito you should be good to go!"}
{"text":"This restaurant was okay, I got the 5 roll tacos and it was greasy in an uncomfortable way compared to many filibertos I've tried, it's okay, it's not bad but also not good. I just have a problem about how greasy it was. To the point where the guacamole slid off the taco due to how greasy it was."}
{"text":"Great food they have daily specials available 
monday-friday today im having a shredded chicken burrito with red sauce for breakfast only $2"}
{"text":"Bad reviews suck but it's just so filthy. It's hard to get past how unlcean the facility is and the employees don't look well kept either. 
I've eaten here a few times but I've decided I just can't go back to a place that unkept. 
Who knows what the kitchen looks like and that's why I recommend going somewhere else. Just doesn't seem safe to eat food from here."}
{"text":"Look this is the White Castle of Arizona, Mexican style.  There are plenty of great stories and movies to make about being out late getting a case of the munchies and hitting up Fili B's!  Outside of this unless you are a burrito connoisseur you need to understand that this place is just great when you need a burrito, or at least your drunk self does."}
{"text":"I usually don't go to many Mexican foods, and I can't say what's good, and what's not, but this place is definitely not my favorite. I had a beef burrito, I felt it was kind of raw, and had juice coming out of the burrito. Dunno maybe that's the way it is, but it tasted wrong and nasty.Also, their beans and rice arent good either."}
{"text":"The best out of all the filibertos. Gets my order right all the time and comes out great."}
{"text":"I was very disappointed to find my child's burrito very poorly made. I was also mad that my specific \"no lettuce tacos\" were filled to the top of the shell with lettuce and it also had very little meat."}
{"text":"BLAND AS CAN BE!! This is my first time writing a review on any website or app and its because I was so blown away by how terrible the food was. I've also noticed that every other valley location associated with this one is just as bad. Everything between the salsa, food, and horchata tastes bland. The good news is that there are plenty of other great filibertos in the valley"}
{"text":"the service is slow and the employees aren't super nice but i keep coming here so who is really to blame for this"}
{"text":"Consistently good pollo asada burritos. Quick friendly service. I like the chicken tacos here too."}
{"text":"Good old Cal Mex style Mexican food. Prices are a but expensive but military gets free drinks. The place is clean and in a great location. Specials all through the week as well. On complaint would be the high prices. $7 for a California burrito with sour cream. Bit expensive."}
{"text":"Really good rolled tacos with carne asada! This is the first time I've eaten at this one but both meals were very good."}
{"text":"I can't believe how incompetent this restaurant is... I had to ask for my order more than three times and when she finally got my order correct she had it wrong at the window.I can't believe this place has such careless workers. I will never come to this establishment anymore. Thank you"}
{"text":"We eat at this Philaberto's at least two times a week. Very consistent food.  They have a drive-thru but I usually go in so I can load up on all the goodies at the chips & salsa bar.  Their shredded beef hard shell tacos are a favorite. My wife usually gets either the shredded chicken and rice burrito of the Pollo Asado plate.  They keep the place clean and the food is always fresh. Their burritos are pretty large so be hungry when you come.  I highly recommend this place for fast quality mexican food."}
{"text":"Wednesdays is bean burrito day, add some cheese and a large Horchata and you have rhe dinner of champions. The staff are friendly and quick. I am a loyal Fili's gal! 10/10"}
{"text":"All i can say is what happened to this place!!
I use to visit this location years ago when i lived in el paso and now this place has multiplied and the food quality has gone way low!"}
{"text":"Good food, good service. They always get my order right and get it out to me quick. I will always come to this Filibertos"}
{"text":"They will rip you off first they don't give you what you paid for they sell you small quantities of food and second they will do unauthorized transactions I had an awful experience here they ran my card twice and wouldn't give my money back"}
{"text":"5/5 for this Fili B's. 

Love story time: when I met my husband, I was 17 and he was 18. He'd work late and get off at 2 am, and he'd pick me up and the only reason I was allowed out the house was my sneaky way of asking my dad if he'd like anything from Filiberto's. So we'd go there for an hour and chit chat and fall in love over carne asada burritos. 

Now fast forward 8 years. We have moved from Tempe, to Mesa, and to now Chandler, and have tried many different Fili B's. This one outdoes the rest! We've been visiting one in Chandler and thought it was good, until we recently went back to this one for lunch and realized the Chandler one was ripping us off! This one gives you great, fresh tortillas, and a LOT more meat/toppings on carne asada fries. 

Overall, this is our go-to place for a guilty dining experience. I wouldn't go inside, because I think all Fili B's have a funky smell, but I'm usually drunk anyway, demanding my friend or my little sister take us through the drive thru at 2 am anyway."}
{"text":"Our family has been huge Filiberto's fans for many years, most particularly this location.

No matter how busy this location is, the staff really hops to get all orders prepared and served as quickly as possible without sacrificing quality. This evening's stop at Filiberto's proved my point yet again.

With long lines both at the walk-up window and drive-thru, the food was prepared quickly and promptly served to the customers all by staff members who were still smiling and very polite. 

This location is very convenient and easy to enter and exit. Located on the north side of Main Street, east of Stapley Drive.

Enjoy!"}
{"text":"I've had their breakfast burrito and didn't think it wasall that great.  It was like too much of nothing special.  If you're looking for just a big-o breakfast burrito to fill you up though, it will not disappoint!

I wasn't impressed with the lunch selection either except for the nachos.  I could feel my arteries clogging just smelling it and there's definitely enough for two or more there!!  If I'm ever up for it again, that's probably what I'd order - their nachos.  Everything else was meh."}
{"text":"I have lived in this area for 20 years and have never gone to this Filiberto's - my intuition told me no.

I should have listened.  But noooo....

I finally said - oh what the heck - it's right here and how bad could some carnitas and a bean burro be?  Safe...  right?  

No.

First - it's 12:30 in he afternoon when I order and the cook is nowhere to be seen.  On a lunch break?  Probably.  I'm a patient guy and he or she deserves a break - NO biggie.  So I chill and wait for a few while watching a Mexican telenovela. 

About 5-8 minutes later he starts to emerge from the back room - not too long as a break goes - so I think oh great here he comes - until he emerges from the back room with a crappy attitude.  He's scowling at the half-dozen customers lining up for lunch and mumbling under his breath.  The young lady taking orders looks horrified and mumbles something at him in Spanish and he stops ranting for a bit.  Only to do it again a short time later.  

You ask - hey what's the saving grace here??  Well, I can fully see him cooking so I feel confident he's not spitting in the food.  That's a bonus! 

I could go on and on but I'll keep this short...

My takeout is done in just a scant few minutes and I haul it home.  The bean burro sucks.  The beans taste like they are 3 days old.  Dry as a bone and taste horrible.  

The Carnitas?  Same deal - they suck.  Dry and tasteless.  

I'll stop back and try for a refund.  Yeah whatever.  I'm not holding my breath. 

And most importantly:  I'm not going back - ever - ever - ever - ever - again.  

Even more importantly - never - ever - ever -ever - go to any restaurant without consulting YELP - this could have been avoided."}
{"text":"Great food. Everything I've eaten here has been up to par. But, service is awful. Incredibly long waits in the drive through, somewhat rude service while dining in. 4 stars for food, 0 stars for service."}
{"text":"Can't complain about this location. Order always correct and fresh. Lines are long but food is made to order. Service always friendly. Green sauce has a delicious kick!"}
{"text":"I went through the drivethrough at about 10PM and got two tacos. (1.99 each) they were good, hot and fast. Its the kind of place I would hit up when you have a severe case of the munchies or have a late night at the bar. I cannot comment on the dinning room service or the food during the day but it was good enought to warrant a day time visit for sure."}
{"text":"The food was good but I'm SO disappointed that they watered down their red sauce so much that it tastes gross, no flavor at all. That used to be the best part of this restaurant-Not sure if they are just trying to save money or what but very disappointed today care"}
{"text":"Filli's makes a good breakfast burrito. I prefer the bacon, egg, cheese & add potato breakfast burrito.

The service is hit and miss, some days you will get excellent quick service and other's it's ridiculously slow. 

Be prepared to pay extra for sides of guacamole or sour cream. Make sure you check out their daily specials some of them are well worth it."}
{"text":"We get carne asada burritos from here a couple times a month. I can live off them. I have noticed they have gotten smaller over the last year or so; that's the reason for 4 stars."}
{"text":"As a previous post mentioned, I'm so happy to find a restaurant in Anthem serving breakfast tacos not just any and all days, but open on Sunday's. My usual order consists of this, a quesadilla for the kids, and some side orders. The quality of these items has always been spot on. I love that you can order on app as well!"}
{"text":"Am I going to be the first regular customer to say the tortillas suck? Let me know when you bring back the old tortillas."}
{"text":"Love the 1.49 for tacos on Tuesday. I have been getting a few pieces of potatoes instead of beef. They charge full price for these always. I will not return, not even to pick up for my coworkers."}
{"text":"Don't think that all of the Filiberto's are the same.  Of the Filiberto's I have been too, this one makes the best breakfast burritos."}
{"text":"Was hungry one night and decided to come check out the food here, haven't been to a Filiberto's for almost 10+ years ago during my college days, just say that the food is still the same.  It was after midnight so they only do drive-thru order, really fast service.  I was happy that I didn't go hungry that night, will try to come back again soon!"}
{"text":"Most horrible experience, first the employees speak no English when their employed in America, the lobby has mold on the ceilings, the tables have rust, the restrooms had urine on the floor. The cook dropped his utensils on the floor and continued to cook with them. I brought all these issues to management and I was told to leave their Resturant."}
{"text":"I found a piece of metal like a bread twist tie in my nachos but with out the plastic coating. I have contacted the store and the Corporate office 5-6 times and nobody seems to care. I am fed up with this place! I seriously could have choked to death on it. When I went to the store to show them nobody even apologized.

Not a great way to run a business and keep your customers happy."}
{"text":"Russ brought home burritos from the 'bertos, and I noticed for the first time.... The food is very, very .....average. It's decent Mexican food, especially if your on a budget. Although I have eaten Filiberto's many times before, I have never really craved Filiberto's, or taken a bite of their food and thought...wow! But, I have never had a bad experience with the food and my vegetarian orders always come out right. I love the horchata!"}
{"text":"This was our first stop after landing in Phoenix.  Hubby has always raved about Filiberto's Green Chile Burrito.  I have to say...it was really tasty.  They stuffed it with tons of pork and the green chile sauce was really good.  We also had a quesadilla and the rolled tacos.  Everything was good, except the red salsa was a little off - it tasted a little sour, but the green salsa was good."}
{"text":"Machaca Burrito? Really??? Wheres the old lady from Wendys? I need her to yell...WHERE'S THE BEEF? Tried their best to pass it off on the AM cook...yah no! Made it right after a small verbal fight. Buyer of food check your burritos."}
{"text":"They took off my original review because I told the truth they did a horrible job and took forever and still didn't get the order right. Sad Mexican food."}
{"text":"meat, cheese, quac, and one giant tortilla! done! Taco Tuesdays! crunchy chicken is the best for 99 cents. red hot sauce to boot. dine in! don't be skerred! see you there! enjoy!"}
{"text":"I was the only customer and it took a while for the chatting employees to wait on me so service was not good. 

There was a dead fly in the salsa on the salsa bar so I skipped that.

I had the chicken fajitas which were over cooked and dry.

Overall I found the food not so good and the restaurant not so clean."}
{"text":"Just so we're clear here, the map does not correspond correctly with the actual street address.  This Fili's is on E. Pecos and not on Az Ave.

But man, Mr. Filiberto, you messed up my order today AND you cheated me out of a horchata.  The only reason I didn't notice is because it took so long for you to get my order out to me.  I was just glad to get my order.

This Filiberto's is no different than any other one around the Valley.  There all about the same with maybe a couple being better than others.  This one is run of the mill.  They do have awesome 'brown' salsa here.  I asked the guy for the other salsa and he said, \"The brown one?\".  Yeah.

24 Hours.  Cheap.  Relatively quick.  No biggie."}
{"text":"This is the worst Filiberto's I've ever been to, the service is always horrible and the food is just as bad. I've been to this location several times because it's close and every single time my order has been wrong. The customer service is awful and is by far the worst I've ever experienced. The staff always wants to argue and are always rude no matter the time of day. DO NOT waste your time and money here. A one star rating is too generous, the food and staff deserve 0 stars."}
{"text":"The food quality at this location is consistently good and the the service is great. It gets busy at times, but still pretty speedy."}
{"text":"I generally avoid any restaurant ending in berto's like the plague because I am afraid of food poisoning that results in explosive diarrhea. 

Yesterday I realized I forgot my lunch and I only had 15 minutes to get lunch. I hopped in my car and started driving to see what I could find that was close & fast. 

I saw Filiberto's and threw caution to the wind!

I got a burrito with chicken, rice, beans, & cheese. It was amazingly delicious! Something this good has to be really, really bad for me I'm sure, but OMFG it was so great!

I am thinking about it right now. Holy cow, I am craving Filiberto's. I guess I'm going to have to live on the edge and chance eating at Filiberto's again..."}
{"text":"I really don't like these types of Mexican food places because I feel my mom makes better Mexican food. Just a note: Not all Filibertos are the same. Food taste wise.....

This Filibertos is BOMB though! They make great Spanish rice, and beans! All the food is great! But I recommend the rolled tacos if it's going to be your first time here. I think it's combo #8 haha. They also have some old school arcade games. That's a plus for me haha. 

Please stop going to Macayos they have the worst fake tasting Mexican food."}
{"text":"Been here twice, place is never busy, and the food has been very subpar and flavorless both times. Service is a joke as well, not even a Thank You of any kind after leaving a 30% tip trying to be nice.  Unless they do some major coupon campaign and learn to flavor their food, I'm doubtful they will make it to the end of the year.  This location needs something good based on it's close proximity to General Dynamics etc."}
{"text":"Originally from San Diego so I know my mexican food and ive been to plenty of 'bertos drive thrus. As the popularity grew, I noticed many 'bertos places start skimping on the meats and servings in general.  So we were pleasantly surprised that this place served huge portions that also looked and tasted fresh.  The carnitas plate had freshly cooked carnitas and I actually couldn't finish it as there was lots of meat.  The beans and rice were delicious as well and didn't taste like beans out of a can like other fast food mexican places.  Flour tortilla was also fresh.  
My wife had the chicken chimichanga plate and it was huge. The chicken was perfectly cooked and the shell was also just right. Her rice and beans were also fresh, warm and plentiful.  
Definitely recommend this place over other fast food mexican places around here."}
{"text":"HORRIBLE SERVICE! I have never waited so long for  food in a drive through!  I would have left if i wasn't blocked in by other cars. We waited for at least 30-45 minutes in the drive through and when we finally got to the window all you hear is the guys in the back talking loudly and laughing with no care in the world. Obviously no manager on staff unless your talking about the stoned guy at the window. This place has turned into a complete joke. Will not be coming to this location again!!!"}
{"text":"I've never met a taco didn't like. That being said, the shredded beef tacos are bomb!! If you are expecting a fancy Mexican spread then be prepared to be disappointed. This is quick, solid Mexican food. 

My kids love coming here. The kids meals are cheap (something parents like) and they come with churros!! Need I say more?

I've never used the drive thru but it never seems to move quickly. Park and come inside so you can peruse the extensive menu. They also have different specials for each day of the week so look out for those. Oh, and the horchata is pretty good too."}
{"text":"I have always been a fan of Filiberto's and happy that there is finally one in Anthem as an alternative to their competitors.  I went there on Saturday and enjoyed a nice sized carne asada burrito (loaded) and a drink for around $10 and enjoyed every mouthful.  It was lean meat and not greasy at all.  The guy who took my order brought it to the table I had placed my drink, which I had not expected and was very impressed by his great customer service.  I recommend this Filiberto's!  I just wish they weren't so expensive, but it sure beats other nearby fast food places where you get so much less for your money and no where near the freshness or quality."}
{"text":"There was a time when I would have given Filiberto's 5 stars. However, that was a time when I had a drug problem. Now that I've had the experience of consuming Filiberto's sober, I can tell it's really 4 star cuisine.

The portions are large, the price is fair, the food is okay. Yeah, 4 stars seems right. The variety on the menu is good, and it's decent quality. It's probably not as good as Chipotle, it's but still pretty good. It's much, much, much better when drunk though. And it's open 24 hours a day, so that's a huge plus.

That's really all I have to say here. Usually my reviews are much longer. But Mexican food is beaten to death in this desert, so I'm not going to bother writing any more. Filiberto's gets 4 stars. It's good, but there's better food out there."}
{"text":"Two words for ya... TACO TUESDAY! Gotta love it. Great food and they never miss. They may be all over the place but worth stopping in especially on Tuesdays."}
{"text":"Ok. As much as I don't want to admit I have a favorite ANYTHING ending with B-E-R-T-O-S, this is it. I've eaten at this Filiberto's over the years more than any other location in the state. Pretty much because it's close to work and it's the place to go when I want to go to lunch by myself because I'm on a time crunch and brain meltdown and don't want to hear any work gossip or anyone's damn problems or anyone bitching about this, that and the other thing. Me, a carne asada burrito, an horchata and fornicate the rest of the planet - this is MY time. Cellphone off. World will have to wait. Sometimes I'll get the Carnitas plate. Quesadillas are pretty good too. That's about all I get here. Plenty of parking for this location - same mall as Fry's, Miele's, Pei Wei, Habit, Petco, Jamba Juice, and Starbucks among other things. I've been here at night but atmosphere is a little less inviting and a bit sketchier. I just get it to go! Better to come inside too. Freaking drive through line becomes long as hell at night. Cool thing here is the desserts. When they haven't run out of it, I get the flan. Not the best in the world but fork it, it's FLAN!!!! Sorta like what they say about sex - even when it's bad it's still good. I wouldn't really know - gotta get out of my mom's basement more often... Oh yeah. This place is cool during World Cup time because every freaking TV in the place is tuned to the game of the hour. And the place get's packed - people staying to see the end of the game long after they finished their lunch. LOL. Mexican place like this is more likely to have their TVs tuned to soccer than them gringo places - just sayin'."}
{"text":"So I was in the neighborhood and needed something to cheap, quick, and easy to eat several nights in a row. Figuring this was a quick and easy take-out I chose this place as a path of least resistance option. However - one night I came a little later and tried to open the door. Nope. Wouldn't budge. Pulled a little harder. Then tried the other door. Then tried the first door again. LOCKED. What the? Holy mother of East Guadalupe Road! I stood stunned for a moment thinking OMGWTF and then I noticed the sign: Open till 10PM. Really? 10 freaking o clock? That's like a Denny's or 7-11 that closes before midnight. Complete sacrilege! The only real reason I go to any 'Bertos is because they are open any time of the day or night. This was the only choice in the immediate neighborhood at that hour since Tott's, Nosh, and Spices were already closed. Well, I could have gone to Zipp's but I'd end up having a few beers as well. But it actually turned out to NOT be a contender after all. No bueno! I prayed to the patron saint of burritos to for guidance to yet another Filiberto's that was actually open - even if only for another hour. Well I actually yelped and found one north of there on McClintock and Guadalupe. That's my Filiberto's of choice from now on. Guaranteed to be open and much more reliable. Also cleaner and with a bigger dining area and even a drive-through option. Why even bother with this place at all?"}
{"text":"Always good when I go... Always get to go... Always busy... salsa bar.. same price as taco bell twice as much food ten times better!!!  if u get bored waiting load up on the salsa bar, recommend street tacos... tons of meat on mine"}
{"text":"Order the carne asada burrito it barely has any meat in it not coming here again it was a waste of money"}
{"text":"I'm not a huge fan. The inside is very old, not dirty just run down. The staff isn't overly friendly inside. The drive in is SO slow... If you are looking for mexican cuisine, just go to a sit down place instead of here. You will probably have the same wait time and price, with a better ambiance."}
{"text":"It takes at least 30 minutes to get through the drive through, the service is bad, and the burritos are almost always made incorrectly. It costs about $10 for 2 bean burritos and they're always running out of beans. I come here because it's 24/7 and right next to my house, but I think at this point I'd rather eat crumbs off the floor."}
{"text":"Pineapple in the adobada nachos is wrong and I am white. This is McDonald's of Mexican food. Terrible. Go anywhere else."}
{"text":"Fili b's is the late night go to. This one by my house has the slowest drive though ever."}
{"text":"Holy Shit! By far the absolute worst Enchilada/Taco combo I have ever had. The meat in the taco was so dry and brittle that it looked like long cut chewing tobacco. Whoever was cooking at 8:25PM on Saturday 3/31, just go fuck yourself."}
{"text":"Filibertos makes my favorite carne asada burritos.  This location is good.  Fast service, good food, big portions."}
{"text":"This Filiberto's was not as yummy as other ones. I don't know if it is just a difference in cooks but the food just didn't taste that good. This was the closest one to my work; I now have found other Mexican food restaurants by my work. Don't want to go back to this location again. I would gladly go to other locations though. Filib's makes for great drunk, and hung-over, food!"}
{"text":"Thanks Yelp! I now have periodic cravings for this food!

Seriously, I do. It's fast food, but more authentic Mexican. NOT Taco Bell. And really tasty!

And I really don't like breakfast burritos. Never. But someone bought one for me, and I was really surprised. It was delicious!

Cravings...!"}
{"text":"Typical mexican food joint. They have very reasonable prices and quick to serve. If you meed a grab and go kinda food thats cheap, definitely go here."}
{"text":"Idk what the deal is here. I got some late night breakfast burritos, and it did the job fulfilling the munchies after a late ASU party. Haven't seen egregious errors in service nor have I meant these infamous hobos. Was a pretty good fan of the chorizo and egg, and the carne asada fries were kickass.

The website as of now is pretty atrocious, I wouldn't be able to tell you the menu off the top of my head but if it's common place Mexican they probably have it.

Stay classy, Tempe."}
{"text":"I'm addicted to this place. The carnitas is the best... perfectly browned... it's almost like candy. Friendly service."}
{"text":"If you choose to eat here. Check your order before you leave. Over charged me the last 3 times i was here. Word of advice to the owner and employees here, know what a kids quesadilla means or a mini az burrito. They put the spicy red sauce in the kids quesadilla everytime, all dark meat too. Rolled tacos weren't even served in the normal container i had to ask for one. 1 out of 5 items i ordered were actually correct. Which is why i think a one star is sufficient. I will happily raise my rating if my next experience is better than this one. Will give them one last shot. I will gladly drive the extra mile for the next location if they strike out again."}
{"text":"All the bertos' need to come here to learn how to cook. 12-2-17 who ever was cooking around 8pm Needs a raise. Best food I've had throughout the entire valley from this restaurant chain. Perfect portion size, taco shells weren't cooked beyond recognition. All around great job, will pass all the other bertos to return here."}
{"text":"They used to be really good until they made it a bar and Grill.  Now their prices are high, the food and service suck.  When going to the drive thru, they ask \"anything else\" before I can even finish. They charge extra for cheese, and sour cream.  Rip off.  They recently had a shooting there.  Needless to say, I won't ever go back.  The Filiberto's in Avondale is in the hood, but they're reasonably priced, clean and the food there is great.  Do not go to this place."}
{"text":"Was ok! Seen a few things on the menu over priced, but my rolled tacos were good and the customer service was great! Will I be back???! Ummm we will see"}
{"text":"Nice and convenient place to  eat at near Sun Lakes. Friendly service. Salsa bar could be a lot more robust.  I would like to see fresh Pico de Gallo, some \"hot\" red salsa, some \"mild\" red salsa, and some Hatch green chili salsa.  Then I would for sure give them 5 stars. Large quantities of food for the money!"}
{"text":"I wasn't sure what to expect from reading the reviews.  Our visit was wonderful.  Very clean restaurant with excellent front counter folks - very friendly!   We each had four tacos which was a lot to eat!  Three tacos would be plenty for most folks.  The salsa bar has many choices including fresh jalapeños en escabeche. Total satisfaction with our visit and we will be back!"}
{"text":"Pretty good food, especially when it is 3am and you are drunk The food is pretty good sober, too.

As everyone knows, their service time is dismal. Can't rush perfection though can you?"}
{"text":"Great food, great service. Hector was super friendly and a great help. I will definitely come back for all my late-night food needs."}
{"text":"Usually I like this filibertos. However earlier today I had a terrible visit. They are charging more than the menu lists the prices at and refuse to honor the menu prices. I am not a lawyer but I call that FRAUD!"}
{"text":"Filibertos is always good for the midnight munchies. My go to is always the carne asada burrito with guac and no pico de gallo. 

This location does have a drive thru and it's open 24 hours. It is in a not so pretty area so alot of homeless people linger around. They do offer an outside patio area if you want to dine in as well. 

You walk up and order and then pick up your food. I always use the drive thru though and they help me right away. 

My burrito is always good but the meat is definitely not grilled. The meat is boiled and I've known this for a long time. 

Fili B's burritos will always be my go to for a late late dinner!"}
{"text":"I always get the carne asada burrito with guacamole only and no pico de gallo. The burrito is HUGE. You can easily split it for two. The flavor is ok.

This location is a little run down but they do have a nice small indoor area you can eat in. 

They also do have a drive thru and they have a walk up counter where you place your order. 

The food is good for the most part and the customer service is a hit or miss. Prices are decent. I paid about $7 for my burrito and about $2 for an horchata. 

There is a ton of construction going down this road so getting in here can get a little tricky."}
{"text":"Staff this morning are very rude, and have no manners.  Very poor customer service. Wow!! But I'm glad the Cook was in a good mood, this burrito was delicious!"}
{"text":"I moved from California where there is taco shops on every corner and they are all good coming here I was hoping to find one that would meet the standards. This place has blown my mind. I love everything they serve. This is my go to spot when I am hungry and need something quick."}
{"text":"Okay listen here. If you don't like filibertos then we can't be friends. Do I want to see the inside of the kitchen? No. Do I want to know their health rating? No. Do I want their chicken chimichanga at 1 am? Frick yeah I do."}
{"text":"I'm not sure why, but the prices are about 30% higher here than any other Filiberto's location. Maybe it's a franchise and this location sets their own prices... I'm not sure. It's still a Filiberto's so the food is going to hit the spot, but I'll drive the extra 2 miles to get to another location and have regular Filiberto's prices."}
{"text":"I enjoy Filiberto's. I'm not from the west coast so to have moderately good fast food Mexican food is a plus for me!

Since discovering Fiiberto's I noticed that they do not skimp on the portion size, you get exactly what you pay for! Last week I had got a sausage breakfast burrito and I couldn't finish it all, they stuff so much sausage in 1 burrito. My other experiences have been the same with huge portions so don't let some of the prices be off-putting. My favorite so far is the carne asada burrito.

I am well aware that Filiberto's is not a typical fast food restaurant but I've been to this one at least twice and it's taken at least 15-20 minutes for me to get my food. Once inside and another time in the drive-through, so unless I've just been there on there slow days I don't suggest you come to this Filiberto's in a hurry or waste your precious gas in the drive-through.

Also, this Filiberto's wasn't as clean as I would like when eating even if it is just fast food.

I will frequent Filiberto's again but I will  be looking for a better one to try."}
{"text":"It is a good location to only get your fix for Mexican food cravings. 
Fast service and good variety of meals.
I personally have other spots for traditional Mexican food, but if I am in the area and lazy to drive, I don't mind.

People have to understand, that it is not a high-end restaurant, which means, general looks might not be the fanciest or the cleanest. 
I have never got sick from eating here........
                                                                     .......Yet"}
{"text":"Food itself it is not bad. It will definitely satisfy your mexican food craving (not the best spot). Price it is very reasonable.

Now let's get to the good part:
The drive thru experience it is horrible. 
While riding a bike with my roommate, I mentioned through the intercom, that we were not in a car, and if service could be provided. (No answer),  then I repeated myself in spanish, (no answer), asked for the 3rd time (mumble in spanish and no answer). Having said this, we could hear background conversations since my first attempt.

What a normal person would do is, just answer and explain why no service could be provided.

I tried this service while on my car too, and forgot about my order. 

I used to go here, occasionally for my mexican cravings, not anymore. ZERO. 

If you are used to this location, consider switching, or just go to the other mexican spot (not saying names) - one is like 2 min away from this place, customer service there is amazing."}
{"text":"The carne asada burrito was pretty good. I didnt go to the place since it was brought too me, but it doesn't really seem that bad."}
{"text":"First the good news:  prices are very reasonable given the massive quantities you receive.  Food is very good, esp. the Chile Rellenos and the Guacamole (some of the best I have had).  Now the bad news:  really, nothing \"bad\" to report, but the counter help was \"just OK\".  I couldn't find napkins.  The bathroom was unacceptably dirty.  They could easily get 5 stars from me if they cleaned the place up a bit, and if they offered a \"cheap\" lunch menu, for like $5.95, with one item (e.g. taco, enchilada, chile relleno), a small dab of beans, and a small dab of rice - and of course, coffee or tea included - I would be there often if they had that kind of a deal.  I would love it if they offered guacamole tacos.  Mmmmmm."}
{"text":"Fresh Mexican food, fast service with a smile!
Carne Asada street  tacos, Carne Asada Burritos
All are good! They have a salsa bar. Oh there Fish tacos are good too!"}
{"text":"The food at this location is mediocre.  The weekday specials are disgusting. My favorite was the bean and cheese burritos. They beans are so disgusting that you can no longer tell that they are retried beans and the cheese is nasty as well.  
The Filebertos on 99th and Thomas is excellent. They still have quality prepared food. Skip the one in Buckey on Miller. You will be glad you did."}
{"text":"Please save your money and do not come here. I made the mistake of ordering from here and had the worst experience. Chicken was very dry. They snuck in beans (under my rice) after I asked not to add beans.. also the carne asada fries were dry and in flavorful.."}
{"text":"The service was great but he food wasn't so good. The rolled tacos barely have any meat and were over cook. My boyfriend got the carnitas bowl which we had before at a different location and came with shredded meat, not this one. It was like a chopped up pork chop and over cooked."}
{"text":"The Mexican food is pretty good with the place being open late night and unlimited salsa and chips. It's a great place for a chill night."}
{"text":"I don't come here often. The reason is I often see the staff doing things that don't appear to be proper food handler technique. Tonight I saw the cook with her plastic glove on go to her purse dig around in it. She took cash out then went to the register put money in. Then she walked back to the kitchen picked up some food with the same gloves on. Put food on the grill and handled some tortillas. That is just gross and dirty. This will be the last time I go to Filberto's. Gross!"}
{"text":"Food is good, but it took about 10 minutes in the drivethru to get 2 burritos. Friendly employee, just a long wait.

*update* 
Food poisoning from the Machacca breakfast burrito! No Bueno!"}
{"text":"Overpriced for the food you get.  Stoner dude behind me in the drive thru flipping me off because my brake lights were on.   A breakfast burro and a taco should not cost $11."}
{"text":"This is THE worst filibertos in AZ, hands down. They are stingy about their green sauce and are always \"out.\" The cashier, if it the short haired skeleton-looking old lady is the biggest bitch ever; try not to make eye contact. If you're smart you'll drive a mile or two away to a better location."}
{"text":"Ordered a beef burrito and it was tasteless, no real flavor.  Really disappointed.  Generous portions, but without flavor...

Also ordered fries.  Half were under cooked.  Some where soggy.

The chesse crisp was good."}
{"text":"Came here to try their breakfast burrito. When I ordered I was surprised when she asked if I would like to add potato for 70 cents. It should just come with it. After agreeing to the \"upgrade\" I looked up to the sign to read into it a little more and the sign actually said 60 cents to add potato. You may be thinking who cares about a few cents but the burrito was around $8 total? Most expensive breakfast burrito out there. And it's in a gas station. As far as how it tastes, about 3 stars. I've had better and it didn't leave craving to come back for another. I didn't feel the value was there. Bacon pieces were thick and good size which was a plus."}
{"text":"This is by far the best fast food restaurant iv'e ever been to. They always prepare your food after you order it so you know its fresh. The staff members are always friendly and consistent with preparing your order correctly. Way to go Fili's!"}
{"text":"Phoenix area staple!  Love the burritos and rolled tacos.  Perfect for a cheap meal or late night drunk food."}
{"text":"Food was ok...but the drive through wait is at least 10 minutes, and they weren't busy!! The inside didn't have anyone in there. Probably won't go back"}
{"text":"I love this place but for the check in they don't let you use it twice. Which would be fine, but it doesn't have any limits written in so that this doesn't happen. Yelp can't offer it twice. Also, they didn't know that it was also with guacamole."}
{"text":"This place is great. Always super fast and delicious. I always order the super nachos no beans and it's the perfect meal. I love that they always hook it up with coupons for next time! I love coming here."}
{"text":"We have been sitting in the drive-thru for 15 minuets and there were only 3 cars ahead of me, there is still 1. This is the slowest taco shop ever! If my food is good I will change the stars. It's 1:40pm, not even a busy time."}
{"text":"My super nachos had a piece of metal in them. The girl at the window was rude too. I woulda went back show them but im sure i woulda cought attitude and didn't wanna deal. Im gonna try to upload a picture."}
{"text":"What can I say... I like these joints! Everyone acts like they are disgusting places where cockroaches crawl from your burrito. I work nearby and have enjoyed lunch here several times now... Don't expect gourmet Mexican food, but everything here seems fresh and tasty. 'Nuff said."}
{"text":"I wanted this place to be good. I think they're franchises and the quality and cleanliness depends on who owns it or something bc I've been to some great Filibertos. This was not a good one. 

It's right by my house. Closest Mexican food by far. But I got sick there twice.... Stopped eating there for a long time and tried it again... And got sick again. 

Also there was a weird incident once when I ordered chile rellenos and I asked if I could just get one a la carte and the cook leaned out of the window w the frozen rellenos in his (gloved) hand to show me that they were frozen together in twos. I... Dunno... It really grossed me out lol."}
{"text":"I give this place a 3, just because if it was truly authentic I'd give it a 5. So it's good in my opinion. However, the dude at the drive thru has the personality of a napkin. Not that I'm expecting the best customer service, but at least pretend like you are happy to be alive. My husband loves the burritos, I love the tacos. It's good for your \"typical\" Mexican place!"}
{"text":"This place needs way better reviews because I fell in love with the tacos here!

I got the carne asada and the adobada taco - both were good and had gigantic portions of meat, guacamole and other toppings but the flavor of the carne asada was absolutely amazing!

If I lived in Scottsdale, I'd easily become a regular here!"}
{"text":"When you want to grab something cheap and fast.....their burritos are a good deal."}
{"text":"I usually just go on 99cent taco tuesdays.Cant beat it!"}
{"text":"I love the taco Tuesday special.....99cent tacos.......Nice jalapenos at the salsa bar..."}
{"text":"If there was a choice for zero stars that's what they would get!!! Hands down the WORST filibertos in AZ! Never ever again will I come.back they were out of everything and the customer service was horrible, the lady Sandra was such a disappointment, I don't even understand how they manage to stay open!!! Olga the manager definitely needs to get her shit together, Mich tacos across the street was better than this dirty nasty ass place... which by the way had NO Working bathrooms!!!"}
{"text":"this is the only filibertos with crinkle cut fries thus making it the best location for carne asada fries.."}
{"text":"Um eh. I was in a rush, it was 10pm and this was the only place open close by.

I ordered the usual, a carne asada burrito with no pico de gallo, and only guac. And we also ordered two beef tacos.

The drive they moved slow and we waited about 15 minutes before getting to the windows. Oh and we ended up getting a large horchata as well. Who doesn't love fili b's horchatas?..

The worker opened the window, went over our order, and took our payment. We got our food and drove away. 

My burrito was ummmm.... dry. The meat was hella dry. Oh and where was my guac may you ask?... it was all sitting at the bottom, yuck. 

The beef tacos had more lettuce and cheese then it did meat. Sad. The red salsa tasted nasty and it was so watered down. Yuck. 

The only thing good of course was the horchata, yay!"}
{"text":"Drive thru was just terrible. They weren't busy inside and there was only 2 cars in front of me and it still took them over 20 minutes for me to get my food. 

I got a bacon breakfast burrito and the bacon was super over cooked, like not crunchy bacon but like hard and dry so it sure if was pre made and sitting for a while or what. 

I wanted to give this place a chance since it's close by but I will find another place."}
{"text":"The BEST Filibertos, and I've eaten at them all as well as the *berto clones.  The meat never tastes like cat unlike at some of them and it's open 24 hours, inside too!  The condiment bar is always stocked with fresh peppers, tomatoes, salsa, guacamole, etc and they actually get my orders right first try.  If you do go late you may encounter a line at the drive through because it's a hoppin place after everything else closes."}
{"text":"I think the fact that I was expecting more from a childhood favorite really made it that more disappointing. But they more than deserve this ghastly 2 star rating.

I went through the drive thru and ordered two burritos and a kids meal.  I got the carne asada burrito, my mom got the California burrito and my daughter's kids meal was a bean and cheese burrito with fries and a churro on the side. First off, they're slow. Like slower than molasses. Two other cars in front of me had to park and wait for their food, as did I. I sat there for a good 15 minutes waiting for my food. 

The food: My food was terrible. It didn't have a traditional carne asada taste (and yes I know what traditional taste like) and it was extremely salty!! OMG like why was it so salty??? disgusting. My mom didn't complain about her food but she did say the prices were ridiculous. I don't agree, the burrito was only like 6 bucks. That's pretty cheap for a burrito. Anyway, I should have listened to the reviews but me being in such a nostalgic mood from my childhood just had me craving Filibertos. NEVER AGAIN!!"}
{"text":"I'm also here from the East Coast for business and was looking for some decent Mexican. I ended up getting the number 8, which was 4 rolled tacos with a side of rice and beans. Not bad - it was good but not fantastic. I will say that I devoured most of the combo pretty quickly so it was tasty and hit the spot but it was nothing too out of the ordinary."}
{"text":"Had dinner the other night and it was great! Food was tasty, I had the Buffalo chicken sandwich and my hubby had a giant cheese burger. Kids are free because it was Tuesday! Server was super sweet and quick!"}
{"text":"Good food I love this Filiberto's always on point this is the only one I come to have nice people and always gives a lot of salsa"}
{"text":"carne asada burrito is the best.....and its not a california burrito with a bunch of rice and beans.  100% meat lovers burrito."}
{"text":"This restaurant is absolutely filthy. Everything feels grimey af. 
A huge cockroach that looked like he works out on the regular was crawling on the wall over by the \"salsa bar\"

As much as I love filly bs. This location makes me want to vomit the small amount of food I did eat."}
{"text":"Rude and Dirty. I mentioned to cashier that the tables could be wiped down and she said I'll get to them, don't worry about it. Okay, what?  I guess I'll stick with the drive-thru. 
Also got the kids meals.with fries and the fries looked like they've been frozen for at least 2 years. I've been to several Fili's in the valley and this one is the worst so far."}
{"text":"Horrible food and outrageous prices! I've been eating at Filiberto's for 25 years in Phoenix and have never been served the dried grizzle beef I got last night. No wonder the place was empty. Spent just over $40 for two adults and a child! Would've gotten better food next door at O'Reillys by ordering a tire for dinner. There was a hair in the side of sour cream and the guacamole mayonnaise was repulsive. I am appalled at how such a successful franchise could allow this one to stay open. 
As you can see, this is my first review. I don't usually complain, I just don't return. But, this was so bad I can't help myself. I feel I owe it to my fellow creekers to warn you, AVOID THIS PLACE!
Bring Carl's Jr. back, this place sucks! Do not trust any good review from this place and shame on yelp for allowing it. Never do you see on yelp all five star and one star reviews. It's clearly friends of the owner trying to boost ratings.
I think we all have certain expectations when we dine out. I could overlook the filthy bathroom and the kids playroom that smells like cheesy feet. I could even justify the huge price difference from Phoenix, if I could say one good thing about the food, but I can't! 
My son's carne asada fries were still frozen inside and he got the same grizzle beef - gross! I guess spending their money on four huge flat screen TVs to display their menu is more important than hiring good staff and fresh food!"}
{"text":"I would give this place zero stars if it were possible. I have given this place a chance a few times because it's closest, but the employees are ridiculous! The food is always messed up and the service is even more awful. They can barely speak English, but want to argue and give attitude when ordering. No matter what time of day, the people in the drive through and inside are rude, it's unwarranted! They've messed up my food every time I order. Will not go back. Please don't waste your time with this location and go elsewhere."}
{"text":"This place is filthy inside and looks like it is not kept up very well.  Service is slow even when they hardly have any customers. Their Tuesday tacos is good, get the shreaded beef tacos vs the chicken. The chicken is to watery and does not taste all that good. Prices are fair , food is okay but nothing special."}
{"text":"I am a fan of all these Aliberto's, Filiberto's, Antonio-Berto's, Stephanopolis-Berto's places. Most all are filthy, in lousy locations & neighborhoods, but the food is usually pretty damn good and inexpensive. Also, I think they are all 24 hours as well. Not only is this location 24 hours, but it's also clean, & in an area where I don't feel like I will be shot at, and the food is really good and very reasonably priced! So glad the concept has moved into the mainstream, and would love to see more Scottsdale locations (hint, hint... Like in my neighborhood up in N. Scottsdale... Mr. 'Berto)!"}
{"text":"What I liked best about Filiberto's is when I ordered an adobada burrito, I got an adobada burrito!  No beans, no rice, just adobada topped with a little avocado.  Most burrito's whether at fast food places are in restaurant are filled with the cheaper rice and beans and very little meat.  Thanks Filiberto's!!"}
{"text":"This location of Filiberto's was once my FAVORITE local Mexican food joint. My fiance and I go out for Mexican every Friday night, we've even named this tradition \"Fili-Friday\". 
However, we no longer go to this location, and for good reason. Nothing is even close to as good as it once was. I would even day it's borderline bad. Every recipe has changed from wonderful to pathetic. 
We have taken our Fili-Friday tradition elsewhere and will not return. So sad..."}
{"text":"Eggs shells all in my burrito! I love filibertos but this one just kinda made me upset."}
{"text":"Ate here for the first time.  Decent burrito.  Can't complain,  but nothing to write home about.  Overall if you want a quick bite,  you're good to go."}
{"text":"Poor customer service everytime. The first time I went through the drive through they gave my order to someone else (after waiting 15 minutes in the drive through) which created two unhappy customers, then wanted me to wait for an additional 10 minutes while they made the correct order. The second time my order was ready and the girl at the window was too busy talking to co-workers to notice. Good food, but go to another location."}
{"text":"Dirty dirty dirty. Food was below average. Prices were cheap but yuck! My friend literally lost his appetite and threw his food out."}
{"text":"I love the Carne Asada burrito, the steak is juicy and tender.  I would give a 5 star rating but unfortunately when it comes to breakfast they never get my order correct.  I always order the steak and egg burrito with pico de Gallo, pico cost extra.  I always get charged for the pico but don't always get or I get a bacon and egg burrito instead.  When I do get the right order it is always good and I can never finish because they are big."}
{"text":"Probably one of the worse Filibertos in the area! 15 mins and still waiting for one order. Managment needs to step up big time"}
{"text":"Horrible place went through the drive through asked for a side of sour cream with my order she asked for it right in front of me...then she gave me the bag with no sour cream inside and a completely wrong order. I ordered a steak torta I got fries a season-less sandwich that consisted of steal and onions that's it.. best advice just go to Taco Bell down the way"}
{"text":"Ordered fish tacos and my food was cold and thrown together. I wasted my money, it wasn't even worth going back to complain... my meal ended up in the trash. If I wanted cold fish, I would have gone out for Sushi! The food was horrible!"}
{"text":"I love this filibertos, the food is always so delicious and the employees are always so nice and talkative with me. Thank you so much filibertos! I will always be your loyal customer!"}
{"text":"Vanessa in the drive thru is the best!!! So funny and accommodating to my friends extra needs of cucumbers and all sorts of stuff. Thanks for a great laugh!"}
{"text":"This morning we decided to stop by and get the breakfast burritos. The gal at the window (drive thur) was not friendly at all. This was Monday maybe she wanted the holiday off. Food was good. Only 2 stars because I  would like a nice greeter, smile, say Hello or Goodmorning something that tells me you want my business."}
{"text":"Came here early in the morning to pick up breakfast burritos, like 10 of them. 
It took a bit of time to make all of them. And if I  didnt have a sleeping baby in the car I would of went inside and not blocked the drive thru. 
Burritos where good and will go back again when wanting breakfast burritos."}
{"text":"This evening was the last straw. I thought the last time I had rolled tacos, they sucked because it was the special of the day. Today, they sucked just as bad. This Filiberto's seems to have gone downhill. The meat inside was practically nonexistent and what was there was tough and dry. Not sure what Fili's adds to their guacamole but it's runny and tastes like plain avocado. On a positive note, the green sauce is tasty, but they don't give you enough of it."}
{"text":"The chicken tacos are awesome! It is tender, pulled chicken in a spicy sauce. Adding sour cream makes a great balance of flavors. Also very good is the ground beef, which is well seasoned and tasty. These alone bring up the rating. The hubby and I have also tried Arizona and Patron burrito, rolled tacos, and chips & salsa...all of which we will not order again. The Arizona had undercooked potatoes, too many onions and was lacking flavor. The Patron was too much meat (ham, bacon, and steak), even too much for my meat-loving husband..needed more textures/taste. The rolled tacos were so dang dry with some sort of unseasoned, sauceless meat inside of a rolled hard shell...no dipping sauce to add moisture and flavor. We had high hopes for the chips and salsa. Ordering it to go, they gave us a mound of chips with their pico on top. We don't mind onions, but  this was overrun with them. It was as though they had chopped up a huge onion and added in a single cherry tomato. No spice or flavor other than onion-tastic. The tacos will keep us coming back. THey are made-to-order and yummy! Food is cheap enough for trial and error . Once you find your go-to item, it is definitely worth checking out this place.Be advised that it feels like it is 500 degrees in there...even when it is cool outside."}
{"text":"Heard about there breakfast burritos so I had to try them.  They were good but not as good as burrito express IMO.  For the money though, a decent place."}
{"text":"I pull up to the drive-threw the night shift lady tells us \"hold on wait one minute\" so I listen to a couple of Drakes songs from the new album. After awhile I check if anyone was actually still their and ask hello? She rudely says \"I said hold on\" eventually I get to order and before I finish each order the woman goes is that it.  and keep in mind there was only one other customer in front of me, they weren't busy at all. Get to the window she takes payment and basically tossed the food towards us and just walked off."}
{"text":"Bad, real bad.  I had to stop at a store in the parking lot and very much regret grabbing a bite to ear here.  I wish I was one of those bulimics and knew how to make myself vomit right now.  Something doesn't feel right at all inside of my stomach.  Why God...WHY?"}
{"text":"I will straight up karate chop you if you even think about not rolling here. You want some real deal Mexican food cooked by some nice ass people that know what they're doing on the grill? Get in your 97 Honda accord and stroll over. may I suggest the super nacho? I just did."}
{"text":"Love this place great food and service and there open 24 hours this area needed a place like this love there California burrito!!"}
{"text":"The food is \"good\" 
But the lady don't change  the combos 
 I ask for a enchilada and 
Chile relleno and she said she  can't
When they do  this every time when I ask 
With any problem.."}
{"text":"This was a terrible experience and we never got to even order. It was a Sunday after Phoenix Pride, we were hungry and waited in the drive thru for over 12 minutes and no one spoke to me even after I called out to them. I looked them up, called their building phone and no one answered. I couldn't get past the person in front of me and I was stuck in the drive thru. Then finally someone spoke to me and I told them I didn't want anything. I needed them to serve the person in front of me so I could leave. The kid on the mic was horribly rude. He said \"too bad, if you want to leave, you can back out the drive thru.\"

The people in front of us finally left and I sped away. He was smiling at the window. I will never ever spend my money there. Oh, and their corporate website never calls you back."}
{"text":"This place is amazing, but only after drinking! I love getting the carne Assad burrito or a quesadilla. One thing I do hate is that I've seen people not wear gloves. I'm not sure if they always do that but I never feel comfortable."}
{"text":"I like that it's always open, the burritos are pretty big and so are the tacos. I enjoy the food anytime I eat here and the service is generally good, with the occasional slow service. The carnitas burrito is my favorite so far."}
{"text":"Horrible. Bathroom was out of service. They tried charging me for ice waters in 110 degree weather and we were with a kid and they charged almost $4 for chips and cheese. I usually pay 1.50 for that at every other filibertos. I think this is rolibertos pretending to be the real deal. Do not go here. I hope they close this place down."}
{"text":"This is by far the worst Filiberto's I have ever been to. I have been here about 3 times and ordered a different item each time since the last thing I ordered was awful. There guacamole is cheap and awful.... I ordered a burrito with the spinach tortilla and it was nothing like the picture indicated as it was a flour tortilla with little flicked of spinach in it..... then the last thing I have ordered was a green chili pork plate with extremely dry pork with almost no green chili sauce on it. 

Needless to say I'm not going to that location anymore."}
{"text":"Much improved experience here the other night. The salsa bar was loaded up and fresh in all of its offerings. Tons of fresh cucumbers, loads of crazy good onions, free chips and three kinds of salsas. The three rolled tacos were actually crispy, but they still are using fake guac to top those off. My other order looked nice in the foam tray with compartments of rice and beans nicely separated. Both of those items were tasty enough, but the taco shell was mushy on the bottom and beef was a bit greasy. The cheese enchilada was average also. Wouldn't mind just coming in for the salsa bar, but might have gotten lucky that night entering at the right time (10pm), who knows."}
{"text":"The only thing I like from here is their rice and beans. I had beef from here a number of occasions and once it tasted like metal. The other times it was just so undesirable. You could get sick from eating this food its no good."}
{"text":"I headed here for a Sunday morning hangover cure. I ordered the carne asada nachos. It came with complimentary strands of long black hair."}
{"text":"I was all set to post a great review because I come here often for shredded beef tacos or carne asada.... tonight I waited 20 minutes in the drive thru for ONE order of Carne asada fries. It's always a long wait but never this long, and no I'm not exaggerating! When I did finally get to the window instead of \"Sorry for the wait\" he gives me my total. Payment is exchanged. I wait another 5 minutes and he finally attempts to \"toss\" me my bag. I had to ask for sauce which I've never! Customer service needs improvement quick or I'll find myself going to gilbert and baseline location. 
On the positive side I do love the carne asada fries so I attached a pic for anyone whose interested!"}
{"text":"My favorite mexican food place in Arizona! Big burritos,  delicious chili relleno burritos!"}
{"text":"I came here on accident. I put in 'Taco Bell' in my navigator, and it took me here. I think I'll have to write a review for Harmon & Kardon later.

I was hoping for an americanized version of tacos, I guess because that's what I'm used to. I know, saaddd. It was like walking into little mexico. For about $7 I was able to get a carne asada burrito and a pollo soft taco. The grease from the food soaked though my bag (as I took it to go) and on my car seats. Eh. The food was pretty greasy, my hands were covered handling it...but it tasted relatively good! The burrito was pretty hefty in the amount of meat, but could have used more veggies. If you're a huge meat-lover, definitely get this! Just wasn't my style with barely any veggies. 

1 star lost for location and employees (kinda ghetto), 1 star lost for the lack of veggies. I'm almost sure I'm going to rewrite this one later since I'd like to try the rest of the menu."}
{"text":"Good food but they raised prices too high they are actually kind of a rip off now."}
{"text":"Ordered a carna asada burrito got a Pico DE Gallo burrito with chucks of onion as big as a quater."}
{"text":"This place should just close down are they should clean it up place is always dirty and always has flies and smells nasty like a wooden toilet their food is awful it used to be good about 6 years ago but I guess now people really don't care how their restaurant looks on the inside and smells and their workers are always sick"}
{"text":"I have been to a lot of Mexican fast foot chains that are privately owned and this one has to be bad. The rice is hard, the beans are good and the fries are bad looks and tastes re fried. The fish tacos are horrible. The fish is hard and the sauce is great. The service is okay nothing to brag about and the prices are high. I was not treated bad at all but I just have to be honest the food is bad."}
{"text":"The special of the day is worth looking at even though it's gone up a little in price over the past year.  I usually just get the chips with cheese on top cause it fills me up during lunch at work and it's only 1.60 for a big tray.  I love the salsa selection they have. There are several to choose from. My favorite is the green one but there is a red one I like too, I think it's called Bake Juan.  I like this filibertos the workers are very nice here. It's the best filibertos I have ever been to. The other ones I've been to have rude people at them. This one is doing something right cause everyone is always smiling and upbeat. I will continue to come here."}
{"text":"'Berto's in my 'hood! The newest Filiberto's has just opened on the corner of 16th Street and McDowell (what used to be a KFC). We happened to catch them on opening day, and it showed. The cashiers were nice, but a little confused about how to take orders, communicate them to the kitchen, and how to work the cash register. 

Hubby and I both ended up getting way more food than we actually ordered. Half order of Super Nachos my ass. The Chile Rellenos came as a meal deal, instead of the enchilada we ordered. Hubby felt a little queasy afterward, but it was from the spiciness, he thought. 

I have since ordered a breakfast burrito through the drive-through on my way to work, and it was just ok. The eggs were overcooked and the cheese not distributed very well. Again, way more than I could eat, but it kept me full 'til dinner. 

This location is open 24 hours. They accept cash and debit cards, with a 60 cent surcharge. Parking is tight, and slightly scary."}
{"text":"Worst customer service! I got charged incorrectly so manager asks me for more money which I paid her $8 dollars total for a bean and cheese size burrito, no thanks! I'll stick to other places.

Message to Jake, the owener of this place.. Please train your manager she does not know how to give any customer service. You have lost one customer for life."}
{"text":"The reviews are dead on. They completely messed up my order, everyone is rude, the food was terrible. I asked to speak to a manager after calling three times and there wasn't one working. They need a whole new staff. I've visited this location a few times in the last year and the service is always poor. I've learned my lesson I'm definitely not going back! There's a different location on 35th Ave and southern will try this one instead :)."}
{"text":"I've never had more disgusting food in my life, my mom and I each took one bite out of our food and literally threw it in the trash. So disappointing and will never go here again. I seriously wish I would have gone to Taco Bell."}
{"text":"Finally!  Thanks for coming!  I've been waiting for this location to open since June!

Nice to have a taco shop that actually HAS the bang punch drinks!  

Fresh salsa hot carrots and jalapeño onion to boot!

I had a beef taco, carne asada burrito, and a quesadilla. Got the Jamaica tea, which is pretty much my favorite drink anywhere!

The shredded beef taco is something that fountain hills has never really had. I'm so glad there is finally someone in town who knows how to make a taco!

Shredded beef, cheese next to it so it melts, then the shredded lettuce. All of this goes inside a fried tortilla. Perfect!

The carne asada burrito was fantastic albeit slightly salty. The perceptions of ingredients however, was spot on. 

The quesadilla was perfect. I know, right?  It's hard to mess up a quesadilla, but somehow many places do. 

My only criticism is with the salsas. Though fresh tasting, they have no heat. This is something that needs to be improved or else I'll be the guy that goes to the other place just for the salsa but orders their food here. What a pain...

The staff was super friendly and the place was spotless. I'll be back!  Count on it!"}
{"text":"Blah! Was craving a breakfast burrito this morning & the place I usually go to was still closed so decided to try Filiberto's since its just down the road. Got the Bacon burrito but was disappointed to see that there was no potatoes, just eggs, bacon, & cheese. It was warm & prepared quickly but it still had no flavor. The red sauce they give out was pretty bad. Asked for chips & salsa & got a big box of chips with pico de gallo on it. The pico wasn't good & just made the chips soggy. The chips were ok. I won't be coming here again, next time I'll make my own breakfast burrito at home. Now I'm just hoping I don't come down with food poisoning which was one of the reasons I avoided this place but I was desperate."}
{"text":"The tacos innards were good, but the imitation avocado sauce/mix reminds me of the fake cheese they put on baseball game hot dogs.   Filibertos, you are losing credibility!  I'm going down the street."}
{"text":"Love this place. The guys who work the overnight shift know my voice on the phone and my car when I get there .... they are always nice. My food is made fresh and it's at just the right temp by time I get home so
To eat it."}
{"text":"All of these other sad sappy suckers that feel the need to bash this 24 Hour establishment (one of the only that isn't a jack in the box or Carl's Jr. I mind all of you) should feel sorry. I eat here at least 3 times a week, I know this restaurant better than most of my friends, and while it may not be perfect, you as a reviewer on this website are VERY FAR away from perfect, let alone normal or sane. Sorry your Postmates wasn't fresh, sorry you didn't double check your bag, maybe they were having an off night, but they will be here for you when NOBODY else is, and for that they should be appreciated."}
{"text":"Let me start by saying that I love Filiberto's. Always have always will. I've been to most of the locations in Gilbert and Mesa but this is by far the worst one. The customer service was sub-par. They don't accept the coupons that literally every other Filiberto's does, which was disappointing. The worst part of this experience was the carne asada fries, which are my go-to. The fries were cold and hard, at least 30 minutes old, and there was hardly even any carne asada on them. Definitely not worth the money that I spent tonight."}
{"text":"Ok, so the 5 rolled tacos were way better and crispy on a recent night, but they are still near 7 bucks. The guac has improved, but the lady at the window was clueless and forgot my free carrots. The key is too remind her right before she gives you the order because as she is putting sauce in your bag, it looks like she is putting in carrots since both items are right next to eachother. Losing the carrots was a big deal and probably the best idea is too get the rolled tacos on Monday when they are on special. No way, those are worth seven bucks. I cut my teeth in SD on rolled tacos, where five of them never crossed the $4 price point. Ok, rant over."}
{"text":"To start, let me just tell you that this place is priced higher than other filabertos locations JUST because its in cave creek. Seriously? Let me continue, the girl working the window had a very rude attitude. First, she gave us the wrong receipt and when my dad asked for the right one, there was no apology or the look on her face that said \"oops, sorry about that\". I get it. You work at a fast food place. You must live a pretty miserable life, but can you at least muster a smile to make it look like you DONT want to break the fingers off of every customer that comes through your window? After being handed the bag of our overpriced greasy tortilla shells without even a look in the eye or hint of emotion (her face literally said \"get the f** out of here\") to be seen from our lovely window girl, we get home only to find the burrito was placed long ways in the bags, you know that angle, long ways so that the burrito juices drips perfectly into the lap of an unfortunate soul who had been chosen as the bag holder for the trip home (yours truly). The paper bag was no match. RIP pants. Thanks filabertos girl, you made me realize how disgusting this place really is!"}
{"text":"We have ate at Filabertos in the past and alway had great food. We stopped at this location thinking let's get some fast Mexican lunch. Almost $30.00 later, I found my rice was hard and crunchy to chew. Not only was it like that for me, it was like that for my whole family's lunch. Looks like it was cooked or reheated too much. Also, the taco combinations we ordered hardly had any meat in them. The same goes for the rolled tacos. I thought to myself, \"where's the beef?\"  This has to be the worst food experience I've ever had at a filabertos!  I have it 1 star because the cashier was nice. Take your time and find another filabertos to eat at or go to a sit down Mexican restaurant. Or, go to the Wendy's across the street. You will pay less for lunch there."}
{"text":"Close this place down this crappie is posion... all corporate now these assholes don't even know how to make a Taco Dirty ,smelly it should have been a Los Favoritos at least make it a Juliburtos all Factory food now don't eat it go to El Taco Felix on Dobson..."}
{"text":"The very best I can say about this place is that if you're looking for a deep fried heart attack you're sure to find it here.

Over-salted, deep fried and virtually tasteless. I'm offended that they charged me for this food. It's bland, oily and the shells are deep fried for so long that if you're not careful you'll cut your mouth wide open. Ouch.

To add insult to injury it's way overpriced for the quality of food that you get. A real tacqueria wouldn't charge almost $4 for a measly carne asada taco. They just wouldn't. Theirs consists of chewy meat and some flimsy corn tortillas. Not worth it.

The people here are abrupt. Not rude, per se, but just not friendly. I'm sure there's a language barrier, just don't go here looking for friends is all I'm saying.

I'd definitely try a different taco place unless you're so raging drunk that the only thing that will absorb the alcohol so you don't end up on the bathroom floor is greasy mexican food, then still don't go here. No, seriously, just lay on the cold tiles and it will be fine tomorrow. 

Avoid."}
{"text":"Well...they either forgot or misheard my order and there isn't even a drive thru speaker to deal with at this walk-in spot only. My shredded beef enchiladas turned into the basic cheese version. They do have decent rice and a fairly good salsa bar. Another person ordered carne asada and she liked her tacos. The place was crowded, but the staff did a decent job of cranking out the food. The cheese version was what you would expect, but the red sauce they use is somewhat decent. The prices for fast food Mexican are too high these days and are catching up to regular restaurant prices. Lazy people or drunks should only eat fast food Mexican."}
{"text":"The line is much too long for poor quality of food. I waited for one order of carne asada fries for 25 minutes in the drive thru. It is very horrible customer service"}
{"text":"Soooo I believe we should start a petition to shut down everyone one of their stores. They have roaches and not one of their establishments have more than a 3 star ?? What is that about.  Google the name of this place people !!! See what pops up. I can't believe I didn't before I ate their.  I'm not going to be able to eat for weeks !"}
{"text":"What a rip off!!!!! $5 for a bean and cheese burrito? No thanks!! It's crazy how expensive this place has gotten. Aside from that, they take forever to get the food out. Over 5 minutes a car is ridiculous!! I will NOT be back!"}
{"text":"Been here a couple of times, food has been lukewarm, inside of the cheese enchiladas aren't even melted, got my order wrong second time. Avoid unless you've been drinking heavily!"}
{"text":"This is a go-to for lunch. My office does not have many lunch choices, so this is often the default. Normally this place is pretty good. Today they charged me for an extra taco that I didn't ask for. It's not a big deal, just a bit obnoxious."}
{"text":"Yeah, customer service sucks they hire mutes! Can't welcome and say thank you then get another job! The food not so great it was so bland!"}
{"text":"How can I be still hungry and spending $15 for 4 tacos and soda my tacos were broken so oily in the amount of meat it was sadly very insignificant for being a Mexican restaurant with no flavor is so sad but the prices are so high I do not recommend this place,and I will never go back those prices are crazy.I called  they say that the manager is the ones who make those decisions I'm surprised they still have a job and a place still open. The quality of the food is embarrassing for The truth Mexican food."}
{"text":"I love this filiberto's they have an amazing $1 menu for weekdays! $1 quesadillas fridays are the best and their green chili is amazing. It is however in the ghetto and there is no in door seating. Hands down best filiberto's ever for their $1 menu!!"}
{"text":"The theme of today's Yelp is: Know Thyself.

Know thyself, filibertos.  Here's what you aren't: Houston's.  I don't need an open kitchen and I certainly don't need to wait for thirty minutes to get my burrito.

Know thyself: you aren't so busy that you need to give out numbers and then call out the orders by their numbers only.  Hey, lady: no one wants the receipt.  We throw it away once you hand it to us.  We earnestly wish you never gave it to us in the first place.  So no, we don't remember the number.  We don't understand why you're so annoyed that no one is responding to you when you call out some number.  I ordered a sausage burrito, not a 1473, so I don't know why you're yelling out numbers and looking huffy.

Furthermore, give us some visual cue: for example, if you ask me if I want it for here or to go, and I choose \"for here,\" I won't think that a burrito in a paper bag is mine, no matter what number you're calling.

Know thyself: at every other Filibertos, the food *is* the entertainment.  We go there to drown in a bliss that can only be made up of butter/greasy butter substitute and delightfulness.  Not for the TVs.  And when you have two TVs next to each other, you don't need the volume on for both.  Because this creates, at best, an Echo Effect.  This effect makes whoever is talking sound like God in some deus ex machina stage presentation.  Which is terrifying when it's the voice of Bill Austin on Beth and Bill.  I can only assume I have kicked one too many innocent dogs (I never kick dogs) and I am roasting in hell.  I would now like to trade in the eternity of Beth and Bill for an eternity of sixth degree burns, please.

Here is the quintessential failure of this Filibertos: the food is shit.  The green sauce has the consistency of applesauce--a fact which makes me want to puke.  The burrito was filled with what can only be fake eggs, and tons of them.  Not much in the way of sausage and I'm pretty sure it was made of something that used to be someone's pet.  And the river of cheese on the side had coagulated.  Worst of all, the nefarious garlic monster has once again shat in my mouth and I now see plants wilting in my wake.

Don't ever go to this place.  Use your mighty dollar vote and go elsewhere.  Because all the good that Filibertos has done in this world is under threat by this fucking impostor.

--------

My wife read the review, and by \"read\" I mean listened while I read it to her, and she fears I might be giving all Filibertos a bad name.  No.  Only this one sucks.  She says you should go to the one on McQueen and Pecos, and she is, as usual, right."}
{"text":"My wife and I were just ate at  Fliberto's the waiter Martin did a fantastic job 5 stars however they have better food in the lower cost fast food part and won't serve it in their more upscale sports bar.  They need to consider allowing patrons to order food from the restaurant that is attached to the sports bar for a small  plate charge.  Especially for regulars who want Cowboys fries."}
{"text":"The best place for a late night snack. Only down side is the drive thru always has a line."}
{"text":"99 cent Taco Tuesday
The tacos are fresh, crispy, not greasy.
Fresh lettuce and cheese. Your choice of chicken or shredded beef.
The salsa bar is clean and items are spicy. The orchata is refreshing and tasty.
Restaurant is clean. Has a cheerful decor. The service is quick."}
{"text":"Love this place food is fast and fresh beer is freezing and prices are great . People are kind. Just the right balance of a fast food and restaurant."}
{"text":"anyone who has lived in the East Valley for more than two years and says they've never eaten here on a after-bar food run is a mentiroso (liar).

open 24 hours, this is only good when your taste buds, along with your judgment, is compromised.

fast food, but no taco bell, this is more authentic. come 2:30 am on the weekends, and even weekdays, the drive thru line snakes around the building, and it's almost all drunk drivers. i don't know why the tempe PD doesn't just stake out the drive thru exit and pick off DUI offenders one by one. expect to see girls running behind bushes to pee and guys trying to start fights from windows, and consider it entertainment as you wait for your food (this can be a 20-30 minute expedition during peak hours).
food is not bad, and relatively cheap. just try not to pass out in your car while waiting for it"}
{"text":"I was in the mood for a breakfast burrito and Los Rubios that is right around the corner from my house was closed. So I went here instead. Service was fast, however the burrito was marginal at best. I ordered the 'Breakfast Burrito', which had eggs, ham and pico de gallo. I was try to eat this and drive to work. 

Bad idea!

I had some 'juice' from within the burrito running down my forearm and onto my jeans. I wasn't happy about this. So I had to fashion the paper bag around the wax paper wrap to catch said 'juice'.

The only thing from here that I can say has been consistently good would be the super nachos. After I typed the last sentence, I realized, every time I had the super nachos were after consuming copious amounts of alcohol, which could be why it was good."}
{"text":"Come in today to get a burrito I order a simple steak, rice cheese and lettuce. I get home and got a fucking bean and cheese burrito and the kid working the counter was the most disrespectful little shit he looks like he can barely work as it is."}
{"text":"Here it goes,  filebertos is fast,  good at what they do, solid customer service and good food.  Only real drawback is it can be pricey. But, hey I keep going back."}
{"text":"These people are MORONS! They screwed up my meal by telling me that they could make something they couldn't and wouldn't replace It, even with something cheaper. They just sat there arguing about how they didn't say yes when they clearly did (or else I wouldn't have paid them). 

Seriously, the are Filiberto's all over so pick a different one, these people suck.

Oh and if you are the moronic manager I spoke to and you happen to read this, take offense because you suck!"}
{"text":"They won't take their own coupons from the back of cash register receipts. 
No more food from here."}
{"text":"Very disappointing tacos Tuesday . Taco shells were so hard no one could even bite through them. 

I called back and and let them know about their product and the girl apologized and then told me to bring these tacos back and they would make give me fresh tacos what the f*** what I got wasn't fresh? That explains how I got my tacos within 2 minutes after placing my order.

Shame on this place."}
{"text":"I don't usually get tacos at 3am. But when I do, I go to Filly-B's. 

Actually that's a lie. I get tacos at 3am way more then I'm willing to admit. But they are always great and even though I usually regret it I keep going back. And really it's not so bad, the staff are always very nice and non-judgmental which is great because I'm there way more then I should be.  

Thank you filibertos, keep up the great work."}
{"text":"The staff are extremely friendly and the service is superb. The inside of this place is the fanciest Filiberto's I've ever been to. It has a full bar which is pretty impressive. The dining room seating is restaurant style which helps with the person feel to the atmosphere. I highly recommend coming here, especially if you can sit inside."}
{"text":"Quality has plummeted in last few months.  

I use to go here every so often for lunch.  Well the last few times I have been very disappointed and disgusted with my food.  Once the taco shells were burnt with old oil.  It tasted like motor oil.  Then today the refried  beans were dry as dirt!  On top that, my churro (I was curious!) was burnt to a crisp!   Another time the lettuce was all wilted and transparent.  Yuck!

Seriously, it was fine for a while, but they must have changed owners or cooks.  I'm done.  Seriously, I my stomach feels violated!  

It was fun while it lasted.   Kinda.  Well not really."}
{"text":"I love the Arizona Burrito, cowboy fries look good too, don't know what else to write"}
{"text":"Filthy place! Bathrooms are not clean and always out of paper towels and soap!!! People are nice , food quality is ok but I am not sure about food handling ! Have to ask for everything : forks, napkins, straws!! OMG! And they get angry about it ! 
I don't know if I ever will be back there!!"}
{"text":"Most likely this food isn't sanitary considering how close quarters and small this place is. But just close your eyes and don't think about it though."}
{"text":", 
The food is usually mediocre-at-best but now the last three or four times there is ever anyone at the counter"}
{"text":"This is my favorite filibertos location. Burritos are always on pointe. The chicken burrito is my favorite because it tastes like a enchilada inside a burritos. Expect t long lines but worth it!"}
{"text":"I love filibertos but this  one makes skimpy sized burritos. The famous forearm sized burritos can be found at other locations."}
{"text":"If you want fast Mexican food that is decent for the price, this is undoubtedly the place to go. I stopped there after the bars closed on Mill and the carne asada burritos with rice and beans satisfied my desire to fill up my stomach and light my mouth on fire simeltaneously. I'd consider myself a satisfied customer."}
{"text":"We stopped here because it was one of our favorite spots back n the day but not anymore . Its way over priced for mediocre food . I got the chicken bowl . It came with beans , Spanish rice , pieces of chicken and a pico de gallo salsa . It did not have any flavor and the chicken was dry . To many onions in the salsa . I'm not very picky but the food was not good . And the Combos don't come with drinks so you have to pay extra . Parking lot is kinda small and the cashier had a bunch of hickies all over her neck and her customer service sucked . She brought us 3 entrées then yelled at us from the counter to get the last 2 ."}
{"text":"I went to this Filibertos for lunch today.  I ordered the Arizona burrito with a water. They had chips and salsa in a plastic bin off to the side. I had some of that before my burrito came out.  I asked them to cut it in half cause I usually can't eat it all. I got the burrito at 12:20pm just in time for lunch.  I ate and left fairly quickly cause I had to get back to work. Literally 20 minutes later I was in the bathroom with diarrhea. I  have had diarrhea for the last 12 hours almost. I haven't been able to eat and I have been to bathroom at least 8-10 times since then. Either some of their food was bad or their employees are not wearing gloves. This is the most horrible experience I have had at a Mexican restaurant. I highly do not recommend going to this restaurant to eat unless you want to be completely sick for the next 48 hours and visiting the bathroom every 30 minutes or less."}
{"text":"I love these places. This is one of the best chains in the Phoenix area. I was missing the \"-to's\" brand of SoCal mexi food from my diet for years. This makes moving here all the better!  

Today I had the rolled tacos Monday special with rice and beans (double rice) and a soda for $4.99. Muy deliciosa!  But my favorite menu item is carne asada burritos and their amazing quesadillas!  

This particular location was clean and friendly and the food outstanding!!  (I love me some taco stands!!).  That's two for two for filibertos in the Phoenix metro."}
{"text":"I went through the drive up window and asked for a side of regular chips with my order, she said it is a extra charge, I knew there was and was fine with that. I get home and it looks like they took old chips and threw them back in the fryer and actually boxed them up extremely burnt, I don't mind dark chips but they were burnt. They also melted the plastic box they put them in. so now they are really not edible. I just don't understand why customer service is so poor. It would of taken 10 seconds to place them in a safe container and to give me fresh chips I could actually eat. A response back would be nice."}
{"text":"It's safe to say that I love Filibertos. But all Filibertos are not all the same, and this location is superior than most. Why? Well, for one- you can actually park and eat your food inside without questioning how long ago things were cleaned or if you will get sick from the warm salsa bar. This location also has employees that will tell you your total before you get to the window, instead of having you sit there in awkward silence and assume they are done helping you."}
{"text":"I love my Filiberto's and their food is always good, consistant and a good value.  Favorites include their Carne Asada burrito, the rolled taco's and on Tuesdays you can get .99 tacos (Beef or Chicken).

The staff is pretty friendly and they certainly remember me!  :)"}
{"text":"I usually love this place.  It's right by my place so I eat here about once every 3 weeks.  People have been nicer there lately and now they usually speak English.  Last time I went, I ordered 2 potato tacos, one with no lettuce. Also a couple more tacos.  I paid for the tacos, then a minute later they told me they were going to make the potato tacos even though they were not on the menu but the cook there that night did not want to do it.  The lady said that any other cook would, but not him.  So we chose two beef tacos instead, one with no lettuce.  They made us pull around to the front to wait.  Once they brought it all out, both beef tacos had lettuce on them. I brought one back in and the cook took the lettuce off put it and new container and the girl at counter handed it right back to me.  I told her there was still lettuce all over this.  So she gave back to cook and he did nothing to it and the lady gave back to me.  I told her it looked exactly the same so she handed it back to him.  He then gave me one that was hardly a crispy shell with cold meat and cheese on it, looks like what they out in the fryer before it was fried.  At that point I was mad.  The drive thru lady came and said she would make it herself.  She made it, and it was delicious.  By then my other food was slightly cold and I was late running an errand.  That cook was very rude and obviously hates his job."}
{"text":"Zero stars. For food & for Jorge the cook who cannot even fry a churro. The cook was also washing a car with 2 people inside right next to the building with a hose when I pulled up. Remind me again why are these in business?"}
{"text":"Went through the drive thru yesterday. Don't plan on going back. 

The server was very unfriendly -not rude, but definitely not trying to be pleasant either. I got a bean burrito. It's just a tortilla with refried beans inside and that's it (I read elsewhere that they do not use lard but I didn't confirm. Didn't taste like late but vegetarians will probably want to verify). My boyfriend had a burrito and enchilada combo and said the beef was really dry but otherwise the taste was good. Both our meals were VERY salty. The one really good thing about this place is that the portions are quite large."}
{"text":"By far the worst Carne Asada Burrito's I've ever had. The meat was dry and had the texture of already been chewed up. When I I first came out west Filiberto's was absolutely one of the best places to get Mexican food. This specific Filiberto is not one I would recommend to anyone."}
{"text":"Taco Tuesday is the best! $.99 tacos - yummy crispy fried shells, good flavor to the beef.  All in all a great taco - it is a little greasy but that adds to the ambience of a fast food taco. (Don't get me wrong these are way better than fast food, but this is a dirve-in after all.)

I am trying the super nachos tonight - late night mexican food craving.  I will let you know my thoughts. Enjoy!"}
{"text":"I usually stop by in the morning to grab a burrito before work. The past few times I've gone I've had an older lady take my order. 
She always seems upset, never a good morning or any professionalism to make the customer feel welcomed it's always a snappy attitude and and a straight face. Never mind the fact that the portions aren't what they used to be or the fact the food is just ok. I had the same burrito at a different Fili's and it was a lot better. I might stay away from here just because no one wants to deal with a bad attitude first thing in the morning."}
{"text":"Go to a different one! Worst Filiberto's and this is my second time. It took them about a half an hour in the drive-through and my order was still wrong."}
{"text":"Normally I'm a big advocate of filibertos. But after my order not only being incorrect today. dec. 21, 2015, my food had a ROCK in it. They are lucky I didn't choke on it or break a tooth. While that may seem like a \"silver lining\" to the optimists of Yelp... I'm SO done with Filibertos."}
{"text":"The food at this location is fresh and the service is good - their rolled tacos with guacamole are great and the horchata is not too sweet. 

They are open 24 hrs and have a drive thru.

 The downside is that it takes a really long time to get your food -- you may be waiting up to ten minutes or longer for a small order.. Even in the drive thru. But on the plus side, you can be sure that your meal was made to order and was prepared specifically for you"}
{"text":"Wow. How awful. Jose is the cook and probably one of the rudest people I have ever met. He burned my food then complained when I ask him to make it not as burned. Do not come here. Go down to the next one."}
{"text":"Yummy!!!!!!!!!! They are so nice, the food is so good! I love the tacos, shrimp burritos, and taco salad!!!! So delicious!"}
{"text":"It's a little cleaner than other fast mexican food places and their shredded beef burritos are pretty good - they use quality meat without much fat.  Their portions are big and  inexpensive, plus they often have 99c tamales. Their tortas are a bit soggy though because they don't toast their bread."}
{"text":"No no no...do not go here, now I'm not talking about the fact that the place looks crappy, or the bathroom is suspect but the fact that the food is nasty. It was completely empty when we were there and that should have been some indication on what to expect but no I am a glutten for punishment. I ordered some tacos and didn't even finish the meal I ended up just tossing the food and still got a tummy ache from what little I did eat. This place is definitely not a good look"}
{"text":"I keep giving this place   chances to make up for the mistakes they make in the past, but they keep missing up my order every time WTF!!!!"}
{"text":"Fantastic greasy and authentic Mexican food. 

Perfect hangover food. I tend to favor bringing it home after a night is drinking to \"settle the demons\" 

That being said... Their food does not translate well to sober eating. 

My husband and I stopped by one afternoon recalling its awesomeness after a night of drinking and were less than impressed.

The store was pretty dirty and I can only imagine what the kitchen looked like."}
{"text":"OMG!!! So good. This is the best Mexican that I have had on a long time at any price range. I can't wait to go, again. I hope they make it to LV soon."}
{"text":"Really like this place my favorite is the carne asada fries with guacamole The breakfast burritos are good too .I always get the chorizo and potato & cheese !The service is pretty fast and accurate!"}
{"text":"Only went here because Roberto's is closed for Thanksgiving. The chicken in my pollo asado burrito is at least 50% fat and tendons. Every. Single. Bite. Also got a small, sharp chunk of bone.

They're also the same price as Roberto's for much lower quality. I've eaten at and loved nearly every -bertos in the southwest. This is terrible.

Two stars because this is by far the cleanest Filiberto's I've seen. And the service was fast and friendly."}
{"text":"Most recently, I went through the drive through of this location with my friend. As she pulled up to the window, the younger male employee literally not only asked for her number but asked us if we had any weed. I'm not even kidding, unfortunately. Not impressed."}
{"text":"This is one of many of the worst Filiberto's I have visited. I recently called to place an order of carne asada quesadilla and cheese quesadilla and asked them if it was this location. I drive to that location and was told that no toll the order. Even worse I was told my order was 14.83. When I got there for Some reason it turned up to be 15.83. 

This is not the first time this has happened. I did a test and ordered carne asada quesadilla from different locations and they all quoted me different prices. When I asked them I was told that all locations are the same even if I opt out for sour cream and Guac. The people at this location tend to be rude. This has happened about 5 times to me at this location where I order the same thing and told a different price every time. I have saved the receipts and even recorded this which I should have posted but threw away in anger before I signed up. Something has to be done."}
{"text":"It's 2 am Friday night, just got a carne asada burrito.  I asked to put sour cream and they forgot again. This is 3rd time they forgot. Couple of weeks ago Friday night about the same time I got a burrito and asked for sour cream, of course they forgot. Never going back there again.  Paid extra 3 times for sour cream, boggles my mind how they can forget. Seriously?"}
{"text":"Very clean inside and food is always good no matter what time of the day you come. Prefer it over other options any day"}
{"text":"Their drive thru intercom is broken. I'm waiting 15 minutes so far with a car in front and in back blocking me from fixing my mistake. I haven't even put my order in. Tell my wife and kid I love them. For the love of god stay away if you want to live life outside this drive thru."}
{"text":"They are skimpy on their salsas, and they give you cold food. This location is by far the worst. I think I'll stick to the one on dysart and van buren. At least they know how to keep their food warm."}
{"text":"The good food is not worth the hassle of dealing with the lady at the window she treats the customers like dirt. On one visit I asked for my change and was told no you don't get change and had the window shut on me, the second time I paid for and didn't receive my side of sour cream and when I asked her for my side she demanded I dump my bag of food out at the window and show her there was no sour cream. I plan on never returning to this location as she is always working when I drive through."}
{"text":"The service was rude and the food was poorly prepared, my tostadas literally had a spoonful of beans on the tostadas. The food was smashed together in in one container (4 tostadas per container)."}
{"text":"the girl taking order's at 11am on 1/10/14 was annoying and if she doesn't like customer service then she should get a job for the city or just stay home."}
{"text":"Ordered a single breakfast burrito. It took about 20 minutes for me to get an undercooked burrito with eggshells in it. Nearly vomit inducing. I've been to other Filiberto's locations and never had this problem before."}
{"text":"This is, by far, the absolute worst Filiberto's franchise in the valley. I have been coming back to fili b's time and again, year after year, out of.... sheer laziness I suppose. 

The orders are frequently wrong, my tacos are always cold (YES COLD) the food is always sub-par and every time I'm forced to come here (usually hungover on a Sunday morning) I cringe a little bit.

U know i would love to know what MR. Filiberto thinks about the sullying of his legendary name by this poor excuse for a restaurant. This is, by all accounts, the Oakland Raiders of the Valley's Fili b's: brash, lazy, and lacking a good quarterback... I mean manager.

7 thumbs down"}
{"text":"\"What is in the chicken burrito?\"

\"Chicken.\"

\"Just chicken?\"


\"Yes.\"

\"No rice, no - JUST chicken?\"

\"Yes mam.\"

\"What's in the california burrito is it fries and guacamole and cheese?\"

\"Yes.\"

\"Can I have a california burrito with chicken?\"

\"Yes.\"

8 dollars later. 

Drive home.

Gross california burrito made with steak.

Tastes like frozen French fries and canned guacamole and chuck wagon beef.

Nasty."}
{"text":"Some pretty decent mexican food, and quiet cheap as well. $5 for a burrito, though it's not as big as the $6/$7 burritos or taste as good as the ones in San Jose, CA, it was still good. if I was from here, I'd probably come here a lot.. maybe a little too much though. I tried an Arizona Burrito, which was potatoes, cheese, and steak burrito. Pretty good, though the potatoes seemed a little too hard, but it was whatever. Just tasty greasy food, my brother said it's the perfect hangover food, and they are open late so :)."}
{"text":"One of my favorite Mexican fast food places in Tempe. Best one open 24hrs. I've been here more than a dozen times and they have yet to mess up my order. This sounds simple but it happens in drive throughs. 

*The fresh cut jalapeños are *VERY HOT*"}
{"text":"The food is moderately good. However, their staff give off the feeling like they give a rat's ass if I'm there or not. Their prices are appropriately equaled to their quality and presentation but its without a doubt a last resort when selecting Mexican food. Correction - they are a step up from Taco Bell. I know ya get what ya pay for but I really enjoy giving my business to restaurants that look like they appreciate it. Sorry Filiberto's but you get mi dinero no mas. Adios!"}
{"text":"Don't listen to any of those 2 or 1 star reviews it was probably some white person that couldn't handle the not even spicy food. This place is so good. Their salsas are fresh and as hot as you would like; there is like 4 or 5 of them. Better than any other \"berto\" restaurant by far. Not even in the same category really."}
{"text":"I tried a carne asada quesadilla and was grossed out by the huge amount of meat in the tortilla. Next, I tried guac and chips and was grossed out by the slimy guacamole. I thought I would never return.

The next week at school, however, I saw my teaching colleague enjoying a Filliberto's breakfast burrito and it looked delicious. She confirmed to me that their breakfast items are generally tastier than their lunch and dinner items.

That same week, I headed to Filiberto's for a bacon, egg and cheese burrito. In contract to my disgusting dinner choices, this menu item was delicious! The large tortilla, crispy bacon and real-tasting eggs made for a satisfying breakfast. I was definitely \"full\" for the morning AND lunch.

Come to Filiberto's for breakfast at dawn (or breakfast at lunch or dinner), but don't come back at dusk."}
{"text":"I've eaten at Filbertos all over the valley but this has got to be the worst one I've experienced. First off when I walked in the cashier was sweeping the floor and I didn't expect her to drop what she was doing and rush to help me but she sure took her time to sweep the floor and finally make her way to the register.. she rang me up and went in back to chat with her friends without giving me my drink cup... Over all attitude was like she could care less.... I'll remember to skip this location"}
{"text":"This place was really good about 3 years ago , once it took new ownership it's absolutely disgusting . Ppl that work there are very rude . I ordered 3 meals and 2 burritos and the idiot gives me 5 salsas ? Really !? And she said the owner gets mad if we give out to many . Tuff luck ! It's part of owning a business ! The prices went up ! I wouldn't recommend this place to anyone . The restroom is supposedly always out of order . But I think it's laziness when it comes to cleaning it . In any restaurant establishment it's illegal not to have a working restroom !   Where do employees wash their hands ?"}
{"text":"Honestly the best filibertos I've been to in Phoenix , very good , clean , and customer service is great! The food is made fresh to order and the salsa is great !  The bathrooms are extremely clean as well and smell like bleach which to me means clean !!!!!!"}
{"text":"When I visit my sister in the Phoenix area, she always wants me to pick up Mexican food for her and this place is very authentic and way above Taco Bell or Bakers or any of those places. The food is messy, but it has the real flavors and the prices are good. They have a drive thru and you can eat inside. I think there are two of them that I know of in the area.. and I think they may be connected with Alberto's (in Cali) which we all know has great Carne Asada Burritos!"}
{"text":"Absolutely horrible. I took my kids there one night when we were all craving a burger but wanted to sit down and eat. It was over priced and all of us got horribly sick. Never again. Especially pissed that I paid that much to just be food poisoned."}
{"text":"Something crunchy in my breakfast chorizo burrito...hopefully only an eggshell!?...spit it out and thrown away."}
{"text":"I am so happy that they just recently reopened! This is my favorite Filiberto's I've ever been to! And they are just as good as ever!"}
{"text":"Pretty much the most consistent place you going to find when it comes to Mexican food. Once you find your favorite items you can pretty much go to any one of the chains and it's going to be the same. That's the reason I give them 4 stars. The food is average. I've never had bad service but you don't want to go after the clubs close. Even then they are about as fast as a In and Out so enjoy, lol My favorite is the California burrito"}
{"text":"Is this the best Mexican food I've ever had?  No.  But if you've got a craving, Filiberto's will definitely hit the spot!  Shredded beef tacos are tasty and the burritos are HUGE.  Prices are very fair as well.  We ordered 5 menu items and the total came to around $25."}
{"text":"The (big Juan ) burrito is the size of your forearm and is amazing.  Plan on a nap after your done eating it."}
{"text":"Finally our own Filiberto's in the Melrose District! 24 hours with an amazing patio and drive thru. Nice for that late night fix."}
{"text":"Tried one last time and not coming back here again. The tacos were pouring out grease and had burnt meat in them, the salsa has 0 flavor now and seems watered down beyond recognition and last, the churro had LITERALLY nothing on them. Just over fried lumps of dough"}
{"text":"Great food, great service. Food comes  out fast, fresh and delicious. Open 24 hrs, clean. A family  place for sure."}
{"text":"Decided to revisit this location once again for my rolled tacos and I will say this was the best visit yet ((it's 311am )) and food was fresh and delicious and the young man at the window was very professional and polite thank you !!!!!! I'll be back again!!!"}
{"text":"I eat here once a week.I always get the carne asada burrito with cheese added.I can't find a better burrito for this price.I'm a Filiberto's super-fan."}
{"text":"I haven't been to a filibertos in years, because the last time i ordered California burrito it was all potatoes. So this time i ordered a bean n cheese burrito and asked her to add potatoes. She didn't have a button for bean n cheese so she charged me for a breakfast burrito with egg plus beans$6.69 later i get my burrito. It was the worst bean burro I've ever had."}
{"text":"Three and a half stars

A dietary staple for any ASU student. The food is cheap, filling, and tasty. What more can you ask for at 3am. Their fish tacos are legit, their horchata is the best in the Phoenix area not being overly sweet and cinnamony, and their churros when warm are also pretty damn good. And  they're open 24 hours. Is their better Mexican Food out there, not at 3am."}
{"text":"Went through drive ordered carne asada burrito rice and beans... line went fast and food excellent ... I love their Spanish rice... im glad I found this location!"}
{"text":"Great lunch specials and daily $.99 items. Always a great meal. Love this and all Filiberto's but this one is walking distance from my place and is open 24 hours soooooo, yeah. What more could anyone really ask for? Typical food, you all know what their food is all about, but I really like this location. Not just because it's super close and I can get great Mexican food at any hour of the day, the inside is unique. They have a few fun games and a bigger than average seating area if you need a cheap, good place to eat at 3am! I love fresh Mexican food, especially late at night. Thank goodness we live in Arizona, and 3 minutes from this gem!"}
{"text":"I decided to give this place another shot after my first terrible experience a week prior. Second time was just as, if not worse. I sat for 5 mins at the drive through menu before anyone came on (it was 9am and NO ONE AROUND), a girl finally came on, took my simple order. She said she'd give me the total at the window. I drove around. Sat for another 10 MINUTES before even being acknowledged. She took my payment with attitude. She could care less what was happening and made it clear I was bothering her just by being there. Another 10 MINUTES later I had my food. 25 mins in a drive through, for a BREAKFAST BURRITO is a joke. So is this location. I get home, and my burrito is 99% under-cooked eggs with a few tiny pieces of bacon fat. I will never return. Id rather drive out of my way somewhere else just to avoid this place."}
{"text":"Hair in my food! I use to love coming here to get the breakfast burritos but after I have found hair in my food not only once but twice recently, I will no longer be purchasing anything from here. Every restraunt should wear gloves and hair nets/hats if you have long hair. Cleanliness should always be a priority. Very disgusting!"}
{"text":"This place was better when it wasn't a sports bar. They make great chicken tacos. Carne asada fries was good too. Now that they are a bar, I don't like the environment for my family any longer"}
{"text":"Terrible everything! If you can't even make a palatable breakfast burrito, you should not be allowed to sell \"authentic\" Mexican food. I live next door to this crap hole and have tried to give it a chance 3x and failed 3x. 

Not sure how they stay open besides it's a franchise with familiarity. Don't waste your time!"}
{"text":"Our friend brought us some Filibertos because it was 3a and we were hungry. It was okay. The tortilas were a bit stale and dry on the burritos. The guac isn't good. It has value going for it though; the portions are cheap and gigantic, especially the carne asada fries. They seemed like a giant plate of frozen fries that a few carne asada tacos were emptied out over. And since it was 3a, even not-great Mexican food was greatly appreciated."}
{"text":"10:15 pm on a Friday night in Mesa.  got an itch for some mexican food.  Headed over to Filibertos Mexican food.

My main target was the carne asada Fries.  I was curious and hungry.  My brother also got the carne asada fries and two tacos carnitas.

The fries were a good idea gone kinda bad.  Fries covered in cheese, guacamole, sour cream and diced carne asada.  

I had high hopes, but was soon disappointed to find the fries soggy (under cooked soggy) and the other ingredients uninspiring.  

The place does scare my stomach a bit.  Reading other reviews today about being sick with the runs after eating here is believable after having been there.

NOTE:  my brother really loved his carnitas tacos, flavorful and crispy.  He would go again.  he also did not care for the carne asada fries.

Kudos for the late hours and cheap prices.  (2 Stars)"}
{"text":"I like the food, but if they ever have the radio so loud I need to shout at the staff and ask them to speak up, I am not returning.
The service was only noteworthy because of its deficiencies."}
{"text":"Horrible horrible service! The 1 star is for the somewhat good food. There's a young Mexican girl there who always cops attitude and is just down right awful: it sucks it's a filibertos so it'll stay busy but the owner needs to know people will drive to the other one to just receive better service and not get a ghetto little girl who cops attitude and is so rude. The food at this one also feels bland and cooked rushed. The only way to turn this one around would be firing the ones you keep getting complaints about and hiring better people"}
{"text":"I come here everyday at night to eat, the kids that work at night are very nice, till today I came in the morning, this f*** stupid B**** wearing glasses scream and giving attitude for no reason when I asked her what's wrong why is she acting like this, she answer me that's how she is if I don't like it I can go else where, ok thank you I'm taking my 25$ everyday else where, sad to see your boss loosing that money, subway next door will love my money better than your nasty attitude"}
{"text":"Carol was very helpful I really like the place and they are very friendly definetly my best place now"}
{"text":"Carnita's a little expensive here, but good. I usually order that or the #11 Green Chili plate for $6.99"}
{"text":"Can I give a 0 star??? They suck, I tell them no cheese on my tacos and they give me extra cheese...I can see if it only happened once ..I tried to give them another chance but nope forget them ..I'll take my money elsewhere..I'm allergic..and then the receipt on top of the taco said no cheese..I think they do the shit on purpose .."}
{"text":"I love Mexican food and this is by far the best chain in town. There's a Federico's down the street but I'd rather drive the extra mile to come to here! Staff is super friendly and their chips and salsa bar are"}
{"text":"So this used to be my favorite place for Mexican food but the last three times it has been much worse than what I am used to. However this last time, I couldn't even finish my meal bc it tasted dirty. I know that sounds weird, and it's hard to explain but it tasted dirty. Their red sauce has stared tasting dirty the last few times also, like maybe the vegetables weren't cleaned or I don't know what. That's fine I can get by without sauce, but I got a carne asada burro and every bite I took it tasted like I was biting into an old dish rag that had been sitting there for days smelling of mold/mildew. This was just awful which is a bummer bc this place used to be the best. Now, i don't know where else to get my Mexican food fix"}
{"text":"Went there today because its .99 cent beef and chicken Taco Tuesday all day. When I looked at their daily specials they also listed $4.99 two beef tacos and a drink for Tuesday! That doesn't even make sense. Why even bother having a special like that?! Perhaps the 4.99 deal comes with better meat and the overcooked scraps are used on the .99 cent orders because thats what it tasted like. After finishing my meal my stomach starting turning a little."}
{"text":"The food here is excellent BUT the service is so terrible it makes pretty much any other Mexican food place's service look like the Ritz. My husband and I work the graveyard shift and they are one of thee only restaurants around us that is still open when we get off. Going there one night I noticed the guy taking our order wasn't wearing a uniform. The food was disgusting that night and gave us food poisoning. A few days later we noticed that our credit card that we had paid with there had been copied and was now being used. The only place we used that card in almost two months was at Filiberto's. They've pretty much lost our business forever because I don't carry cash and I don't trust them with my cards anymore. They're fine before ten o'clock at night, after that--DO NOT BOTHER. The service normally sucks bad enough, but this tipped it over the edge."}
{"text":"this was the worst filibertos I've been to, it's literal trash. all the burritos fell apart and each item was dry and tasteless. a single Taco Bell crunchy taco has more taste than the food we received. one of my burritos tasted like soap and coffee and while mid-chew I felt some texture close to an eggshell break in my mouth. we waited way too long for this to come out like it did... disgusting"}
{"text":"In Short: It's not the greatest  but you do get a mountain of food.  This is OK if you are drunk.

Filibertos is a staple for drunken college kids around ASU, it's fast and cheap, and you can feed a small army with one plate.  Except for that, there's nothing much to write about.  Most of the food contain loads of carbs, some meat and a unhealthy slathering of cheese, guacamole, sour cream, and oil (it's more like a combination of all or some of the ingredients).  That's pretty much it, not much frills.  If you are drunk, I'd say this will be the place to go to get some food in you, but as mexican food goes, this is around the bottom of the list."}
{"text":"I love Filiberto's rolled tacos.  I always have to get an order with my food.  It's great that they are 24 hours and most locations have a drive-thru.  My go-to's are the Spanish Omelet with rice & beans and a tortilla or one of their fat burritos.  Any of their breakfast burritos rock and they are made to order and under $5.  How can you go wrong?  Their nachos and Carne Asada Fries are very tasty and filling.  The prices are cheap and for Mexican fast food, I really can't think of a better place.  Plus to wash all of that food down with a large Horchata?  Game on!"}
{"text":"Came here after a night of drinking brews with some good friends around 2am. All the lights were off, so I was sketched out about stopping by, even though the hours are \"24/7\". Proceeded to the drive thru and was actually greeted with a \"can I take your order\" in broken English.  I made my simple burrito order, moved on to the pay/pick up window. Waited for about 20 mins and no body responded or showed up. Sooooo, disappointing, since Filiberto's is supposed to be a 24/hr Mexican food place, which I usually enjoy. I won't be spending my hard earned mula here anymore. Take it from me, this location is a joke.."}
{"text":"Sometimes I get really drunk and want the Filiberto's Super Nachos.  Filly B's Super Nachos consist of tortilla chips with some salsa, cheese, beans and then A SHIT LOAD, like, seriously, at least three full cups, more than you'll ever eat, of low quality, delicious beef.  Most times I've eaten them I am black out drunk and did something more stupid than eating Filiberto's Super Nachos, like punching my boyfriend in the face.  These nachos are literally the only reason I do those two or seven extra shots sometimes.  When I leave Phoenix, Filiberto's Super Nachos (I order them with no sour cream so they're totally healthy) are going to be in the top three things I miss; right after racist sheriffs and your mom."}
{"text":"Did you know that on Tuesday you can get tacos for 99 cents?  Well, you can, and the beef tacos are amazing.  When you bite into them, you have grease running down your chin, so keep a napkin handy.   They come with a ton of fresh crispy shredded lettuce, and they don't skimp on the cheese either.  The chicken however, always tastes funny to me.  STAY AWAY FROM THE CHICKEN.......  They do have some outdoor seats, but this place is pretty much a drive through."}
{"text":"Finding quality mexican food is sometimes hard to find. But I heard I should try Filibertos'. Well, I don't know if it was a bad day, the three times I've eaten there; but this is not what you would call quality mexican food. Greasy, over packed with ill prepared ingrediants, dry carnitas and a long wait was not what I was expecting. I was disappointed. And even though I gave it a few more chances, hoping each time it would get better. It did not. So farewell Filibertos. Maybe you will learn the true way to make authentic mexican food."}
{"text":"Have passed by this place several times and laughed.. Filiberto's sports grill?? Decided to go in and wow, it's great!  
The food in the sports bar was awesome. Got the BBQ bacon cheese burger. WOW it was really fantastic and the french fries were great. Hubby got a club sandwich. Was really very good and the bread it was on was great too. Servers were awesome. Place is inviting and tons of tvs. The tables are spacious and nice. Very clean too. Will definitely go back! This is really a place to try for yourself!"}
{"text":"Got delivery for bean and cheese burritos.... 0 cheese and the beans tasted like metal but the tortilla was good so I honestely cooked canned beans with cheese and way better in taste and quality... Good luck fillibertos probably never ordering again"}
{"text":"Dude, don't eat at Filiberto's.  I do not understand why they are so popular all over the Valley.  Maybe it's good for drunks whose stomachs are so polluted with skunky beer and whose palate has been ruined by smoking cheapass ditchweed, but the food at Filiberto's looks like someone already ate it and they put it on a paper plate.  I tried it twice to be fair and I feel lucky to be alive."}
{"text":"Always great customer service at this place!  They answer your questions about menu, no matter how many items you ask about.  Good is always hot and delicious.  Highly recommended for Mexican Fast Food!!"}
{"text":"I have been here many times and have to say \"eew\"! the place isn't very clean, the staff isn't that helpful. Everytime we would go there would be something wrong with our food. last time we were there I ordered the 2 cheese enchilada's. They were gross the sauce was too spicy and no flavor and the cheese wasn't melted. Everytime I would go there it wouldn't taste good, bland and melted cheese as well as they just rushed through it. No part of it was tasteful or anything. I have tried there chicken Enchiladas and those are even more tasteless and make you sick to your stomach!"}
{"text":"Late last night with the munchies and the wife and i settled for the carne asada fries ... Wow Amazing .... Then our drive thru guy Kenny was just an absolute pleasure to deal with . Thank you Fili B's and Kenny for a great late meal"}
{"text":"This Filli B's is right by my house, so they get 5 stars for convenience (not to mention they're convenient wherever you might be) 
This particular location has service and food that is consistently on point. I have never gotten anything sub par. The restaurant is very clean, well lit, well stocked and fully staffed. The girl at the counter is kind and always greets me with a smile. I love this Filliberto's."}
{"text":"I go here all the time. Great tasting food, nice clean restaurant and the cashier's are really friendly."}
{"text":"Customer service was not at all on point, neither was the food. Took back dried beef taco in its chewy shell and the cashier had an explanation for why it was dry and chewy...defending this terrible food. Did not even try to understand from my point of view, even when I showed her the dry beef. But, I knew what her attitude would be just seeing how she treated the previous customers. So sad."}
{"text":"Your standard west coast taco stand. It satisfied my carne asada fix, seems like the place to grab a bite after some late night hype."}
{"text":"my boyfriend and i were super excited to try out filiberto's because we had heard so many great things about it on our college campus. tonight we were sick of campus food and wanted a change. we decided to give it a try. and boy what a disappointment it was.. i literally wanted to take back my hunger and go get all day mcdonalds breakfast. the service was terrible and the place was hotter than hell. we even decided to sit outside to escape the heat inside because we were both sweaty after ordering. the man at the counter had an extremely salty attitude toward us and acted bothered to say hello and help us. the food came out quickly, but wasn't even worth the wait. the chicken tacos had absolutely no flavor and the salsa might as well have been water. the hype is overrated. we will never be back."}
{"text":"I came in here hoping to experience a delicious carne asada torta.  On the other hand, the carne asada was very hard to chew and not pleasing to the taste.  The restaurant's interior is clean and inviting with TV screens.  Many business professionals make up the lunch time customer base.  I was just dissapointed with the carne asada."}
{"text":"By far the worse rolled tacos ive ever had. The rolled tacos taste like hamster food and fish covered in what's supposed to be guacamole...but the guacamole tastes like gasoline. I feel sick after eating at this location. Save your money and go to taco bell. This place is NO BUENO."}
{"text":"So I'd had the hankering for a machacha burritos for two weeks. I decided after work to find the nearest Filibertos drive-through and saw one in Mesa on main only a few miles out of my way. I ordered two machacha burros...I didn't see it on drive through menu so I asked. The  told me yes..they had them. I can't wait..I order two..get home..and one is chicken ( didn't ask for chicken ) and the beef one is NOT machacha. It's got eggs..other unidentifiable things and it's so disappointing that I'm actually upset. I NEVER do drive through or fast food..but know the difference between this burro with a lot of filler and the \" real deal\". What a bummer. Nether is worth eating and is going into the garbage..and I'm still wishing that I had satisfied my craving."}
{"text":"I went there late last night, first because there is 99 cent tacos, and second, because I love late night Mexican food, especially if I partner it with an antacid pill.  Got tacos and rice.  Tacos were wonderful, crispy, and taste awesome.  Rice was very good (5 stars for this)   Now I usually go to the Filis on Dobson and Main, but this was on my way home.  The one on Dobson and Main puts more meat and lettuce in their tacos, so I do prefer that location.  The taste of these though were on par.  Would have given it 5 stars if they would have put more meat and lettuce in it (yes, I know, I am repeating myself).  Can't beat Filibertos, good, inexpensive authentic Mexican food....thank you!"}
{"text":"I just went in here and got some tacos for lunch.  I love taco tuesday, unfortunately, every time I go to this location, the tacos really really suck.  Hardly any meat, taco shells and meat are way overdone, not much cheese.  And they give you one sauce for 3 tacos.   I was in the neighborhood, and thought I would try it again.  I won't make that mistake again.  The FiliB's on Main and Dobson in Mesa is soooo much better than this place, at least 3 times the meat, tacos shells are crunchy without breaking your front tooth off, and they are much friendlier too.  Don't waste your time at this location, go to the one in Mesa, it will be worth your time!"}
{"text":"Came here to get dinner after a few hours at the hospital and wished we went somewhere else. First off. After every item we ordered she tried rushing us to the window and wouldn't ask if we wanted anything else. During that, my friend went inside to use the restroom and no one acknowledged her until she noticed a kid (maybe 2 or 3 years old) running out of the kitchen. They then helped her. The food adter just did not taste right and we have been here before a few times where it tasted pretty good. The fact that my friends first meal after a few days of not eating was not only not good but the service is terrible we will most likely go somewhere else from now on. Let's hope OSHA walks in to see this."}
{"text":"We have been to this filibertos many times in the past with good service and great food however today ( which by the way will be our last time ) the food was really bad, we ordered supreme nachos, shredded beef taco and a I think a chicken taco ( I ordered a grilled chicken taco which the lady at the registered repeated back when she took our order ) all I can say is what a disappointment ......."}
{"text":"Went to place an order in drive thru, the person taking order was rude and made it seem like I was a inconvenience ( there was only one other car in line ) got to the window not much warmer I won't be back....."}
{"text":"OK so writing a bad review for this place is almost like a high school kid kicking a defenceless baby , it just does not make any sense. But what I have to say is to important. DO NOT EAT AT THIS PLACE EVER!!!! Seriously I understand that not everyone likes taco bell or has the time to make food at home but eating this food is not a option it is a dare. Like I dare you to eat that taco and not spend most of the night on the bathroom floor with your face deep in the toilet bowl.

I would give this place a half star if I could because the only thing good about this place is the fact that they are cheap enough for the people who are crazy enough to think the stuff they sell here is food. This is not a review it is more like a public service announcement. 

Attention great citizens of AZ do not eat here unless you enjoy, then have the fast talking guy from those medication commercials read a list of side effects (eating this food may cause bubble gut, late night trips to the ER, stomach pumping, the shakes, and forced consuming of various intestinal aids such as tums and pepto bismol) lol."}
{"text":"Low cost and descent Mexican cuisine. A very helpful employee took my order and told me all about the specials. Open 24 hours."}
{"text":"This franchise location lost two stars for messing up on my order (twice) during a single situation. The food tastes good; the facility looks clean; and the service is both prompt and courteous.

I ordered an item off the menu and asked for two extras, paying for the addition. I drove off and was already several blocks away when I discovered  their mistake--they'd made my order wrong(!), including a LOT of a food item of which I am allergic(!).

I returned to the franchise double checked the menu, confirming the mistake was theirs and not mine. I went in to address my concern, the manager saw me and asked whether I received the wrong order, to which I replied yes. The manager responded promptly to 'correct' the error. But...

I waited for my replacement, hopefully correct, order. Unfortunately, they still got it wrong. They failed to include the items for which I had paid extra $. (But, at least my order no longer contained the product of which I am allergic!)

Summary, always take personal responsibility to double check your order(s) in all circumstances--and accept nothing less than accuracy when receiving your order(s)."}
{"text":"The food is great of course but the staff are somewhere between just plain rude, lacking personality, and not very smart.  And the drive thru takes an eternity.... Don't expect \"fast\" food at this location."}
{"text":"Not only a Filiberto's, but a great sports bar!!. Great happy hour, great food, and great service. A real gem in Buckeye!

This was our first visit, Amber was a great help with our happy hour selections!!

{"text":"I ordered the cowboy fries... And while I normally like them, today they were  freakishly hot! It was take out but, i sat and ate some in the box because I was with a friend. Whoa- it was fire. I took them to the cashier and told them it was too hot, not what I normally experience.  The cashier told me, becauae I ate some he wouldn't make me one without the jalapeno,  because I ate a small corner of the box. He said he couldn't make me another with out the jalapeno. I told him, look i can't eat this, I like hot, but this super hot. He tells me, the manager said no. Well I threw the box away. I told him, I can't eat it, it's just too hot. The cashier said well that's my fault. 
Really?!?!?!? I come in all the time and this is how a regular is treated....

23 days and counting... no effort to make this right."}
{"text":"Had some tacos on taco Tuesday yesterday and immediately got an upset stomach.  Woke up this morning and was in the bathroom more than once.  Don't think I'll be going back here unless I want to have the same brown issue."}
{"text":"My friend brought me the chimichanga combination plate which comes with rice and beans (no Mexican meal is complete without beans and rice). It was lovely - not superb, but it gave me just the right amount of satisfaction for the start of the day.

The chimichanga had way too many mediocre green peppers in it for me to give it anything more than three stars. The rice and beans were of a solid good quality; this would be approaching a 3.5 star review if only these were available in larger portions. Unfortunately, the chimichanga was HUGE and the sides were tiny tiny.

If you're looking for a quick and greasy Mexicano meal to fill you up, this is the ticket. Looking for something great? Pass this place up and head to Fiesta Burrito."}
{"text":"For fast mexican food...can't beat them. Please open a store in Virginia Beach.  Taco Hell sucks!  Fish burritos rock!"}
{"text":"I lived around the corner from here for over a year. I was there a few times a week. They have great breakfast, fish, and chicken burritos...actually...any burrito rocks. I MISS them and every time I visit AZ I eat there.  I even have my mom addicted.  For fast food, they are my fav."}
{"text":"Great food after a night of drinking. However, you are going to have to wait for a while before you enjoy it. I have never been here, night or day, and had good service. Whether it's sitting and waiting to place your order or waiting to receive your food, you can guarantee being there for like 20-30 minutes. As everyone mentioned, you need to try the carne asada fries. You won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"I came here at the suggestion of a friend and it being down the street I figured why not, which was my first mistake. 

I ordered the Carne Asada Burrito - Care Asada, Potatoes and cheese. 

Cheese came out cold and unmelted in the burrito, meat wasn't that warm and potatoes tasted like they have been under a warmer for quite some time.

The salsa bar did not help much either, due to the salsa being semi warm (this is 9am mind you) the red wasn't too bad in flavor, but the green just did not have any redeeming qualities, so i ate maybe a 3rd of the burrito and trashed the rest.

Now the fun starts, I go to pick up my fiance from her massage down the street at 10am and it hits me like a ton of bricks.. Needless to say she gave me the \"i told you so\" and off i went to handle business. 

NEVER AGAIN."}
{"text":"Love Filibertos. Not to be confused with Fredricos or Humbertos or any other os. Great food."}
{"text":"Horrible customer service. After 5 minutes of nobody greeting me the woman who finally came to the register didn't apologize for the wait. Honestly didn't even say two words the entire transaction. If you don't want customers trust me I won't be back. Wish I could give 0 stars"}
{"text":"This place is great for late night food. Big ol' burritos and cheap as it gets, you know the drill. Personally I do late night breakfast burritos, it's kind of my thing."}
{"text":"First time at this Filiberto's and ordered to go. 

Got an Adobado plate, rolled taco plate and five rolled tacos for $21. Not bad. It was pretty full but the line moved fast. The order arrived in 11 minutes. 

The rolled tacos were received well. Lots of yummy sounds coming from those guys. I had the Adobado and it was pretty dry. The tortilla was very dry, so I'm guessing the to go order got the second rate stuff. Too bad because Adobado can be so good. 

These guys need to work on timing."}
{"text":"First time at this Fili B's. Stopped by on a whim on a Monday at noon. There were three people there. Very small place.

It wasn't very clean in there, the register wasn't working and it didn't smell great. The parking lot is also very small. I chose to go here instead of the new place down the block because they don't have AC there. It was still about 80 degrees here. 

Despite only three people, my lunch took 15 minutes. The lady behind me in line came in to argue that her large order from an hour ago was wrong. The cashier didn't speak very good English, so she got the cook involved. They argued for about five mins, then the customer threw up her arms, shaking her head and walked out. 

The crew continued to argue with each other, in Spanish, so our meals were delayed that much more. 

Fili B's always has good food but I'll go somewhere else next time."}
{"text":"We are complaining about the conduct of the staff at one  restaurant was terrible. My husband is a diabetic whose glucose levels dropped. He wanted a cola but staff walked off so he went to gab a cola than they accuse him of stealing even though he let them know his glucose was dropping and he was not going anywhere. He wears an insulin pump as well. I will file with Yelp as well the BBB and lastly the Media. Just like Starbuck sensitivity training needs to be require of all staff. It was bad that they thought it was funny walking away from him. If you have cameras you need to check it. The name of the waitress is Paty and her supervisor Kimberly. Both were yelling at my husband. The # 73 on 1440 Dysart Rd in Avondale @ 1:09pm 5/30/2018"}
{"text":"My son and I ate here the last time we were out in the Phoenix area. I always make it a point to eat at Filibertos every time I am in Arizona since all we have is bland Tex-Mex in Texas. As with the other two locations I've been to, the food quality was very good and the service was quick. I guess the only bad thing I can say is the person who sat behind us was a really loud gangbanger wannabe who was telling the person she was with about all the gangs she ran with in El Paso. Guess that really isn't the restaurant's fault though."}
{"text":"I'm giving it 4 stars because the outdoor eating area smelled bad (reeked of beer) so I ate in my car.
ANYWAYS I got a fish burrito (pictured) and the special for Friday; a cheese enchilada for 99¢! My bill was $6 and something cents! 
Fast service, and I got one of the BIGGEST burritos I have ever had! Delicious fish too! The enchilada was very good. I will go back! 
Cheap cost, good food. :)"}
{"text":"This place is getting worse and worse. On Saturday i order a California burrito through the drive through. When I got home the damn burrito was not even close to be warm, the potatoes were partially still frozen,  what little meat there was seemed old and tuff like its been sitting all night  and it was drowned in pico de gallo and guacamole, like they were trying to cover up the fact that there was hardly any meat and not fresh what so ever.  And the cheese havent he started to melt. Ive had a few bad trips here before but it was here and there. This was the worst one so far. Im gonna have to give this place a rest or stop going all together. It sucks cause this is the only type food around here, but u cant keep serving food like that to people and expect them to keep coming back."}
{"text":"For fast food, this place rocks! It's open 24 hours, has amazingly huge fresh portions, and always has a good-size handful of customers that seem happy with their food :) I love the chicken taco salad, although I wish the shell was corn instead of flour. The beef rolled tacos with guac are tasty and the fresh salsa bar that includes gardineria and fresh cukes is a plus! yummers!"}
{"text":"My wife and I stopped in for dinner last night kind of on a whim.  The place was packed which did make the service slow.  However, the server we had was bubbly, informative, and friendly.  She pointed out some of her personal favorite items on the menu as well as some customer favorites.  My wife ordered shrimp and chicken.  The plate was heaping with food and she said it was very good.  I had a bacon cheese burger and fries.  How else are you going to judge a sports bar if you don't try a burger?  The patty was thick and juicy.  It appeared to be fresh meat and not frozen.  Not the best burger I have ever had but far from the worst.  We also ordered a basket of onion rings.  These were awesome.  The batter is great.  

There are TVs everywhere you look.  Nice for a sports bar.  It is pretty small inside and that makes it cramped.  Could only imagine it on game day or later at night.  

We would go back again.  Not sure how it would be for children.  There were many folks being happy and having a great time at the bar if you know what I am saying.   This was at about 630 pm."}
{"text":"I don't know why, but this Filiberto's is significantly more expensive than other burrito places.   $6 for a country burrito!!!  Also, they let you know your food is ready by calling a number.   Problem is you have no idea what your order number is.   It is not listed anywhere on the receipt you are given.  First time and last time for this location.    No value here and poor execution."}
{"text":"Horrible. I'm gong to write more later because I'm driving but I had to QUICKLY EXPRESS my disdain for this joke of a food establishment."}
{"text":"There are not a lot of condiments comparing to other places that I have been to, but the portions are huge. I love the Beef Burrito here, and that is the only thing that I have tried so far. They give out plastic cups for water, which makes it more fancy. Staff can maintain a nice talk, but with no smile - doesn't matter. I leave with a happy tummy, needless to say this place opens 24/7."}
{"text":"Very expensive, and the food quality is unpredictable. The white sauce they use on fish tacos is a thick, white, flavorless paste. The eggs in their breakfast burritos are watery. But most appalling are the prices. Obviously Filiberto's sets their pricing depending on the location, but I don't know why they thought Scottsdale prices would work in Sun Lakes.  $11.45 for two carne asada tacos? This won't last. The customer service is very good however, so please keep that up."}
{"text":"i would give this place a 0. the too pricey for such little food and lacks taste as well has flavor.  would recommend to anyone yo never eat there!"}
{"text":"I love this place, but tonight was definitely a deal breaker. Someone who works there had both of their young kids, about 6 and 5 years of age, running around the restaurant, they were back by the grills and behind the counter. Who knows what they touched and got in my food...kids are dirty. Also, the people who worked there were giving out free food to many different people and the kids. 

I understand that this is a Mexican restaurant, but these like are very racist. My boyfriend sat there waiting for about 15 minutes for our food, and a Hispanic woman came in and got her large take out order within minutes. 

As good as their food is, tonight definitely changed my opinion on this location."}
{"text":"I like your food but what I don't like is the service that you guys give except the girl at night she's thick with black hair I don't know her name but she's super nice and I never have a complaint about her. This two star is for the girl (yup that's her in the photo)who took my order today 12/10/17 at 11:03am. I was placing my order and she literally didn't give me a chance to tell her what I didn't wanted on my food, she was reaping \"anything else\" after I said a word and that just made me feel rush. Either she needs to get more dam training with customer service or just be in the back cooking!!!! No wonder your restaurant has low stars and they rather spent more money at the jack in the box next to you instead of coming here!"}
{"text":"The best Carne Asada Burrito in town. I have lived in the Valley of the Sun my entire life and have tried every Mexican restaurants Burritos in the valley. I need my fix about once every couple weeks, I even turned on my coworker to the Carne Asada Burrito and he is now a fan. The Carne Asada Burrito runs just under $5.00 and will fill you up, no room for chips and salsa, or Fries, I also recommend the Carnitas (diced pork) Burrito."}
{"text":"Rice and beans only thing that was good. Got the chicken tacos, the shells were gross. My mom got a enchilada and burrito and took 2 bites. Only liked the rice and beans too. Not worth the 20.00 bucks we spent."}
{"text":"Do not dine here unless you want a side order of Montezuma's Revenge.  We ordered takeout on 6/24 and ended up violently ill with food poisoning within 8 hours.  We also had to get on a plane the day after, and so far our vacation sucks because my husband and I are stuck in the bathroom. Thank God I only ate half the burrito."}
{"text":"Best one around the Carne Asada burritos are off the chain and the avocado green salsa is amaze balls"}
{"text":"Yes, yes, I am giving a restaurant with a drive through five stars!

Filibertos, my guilty pleasure.. I'm a slave to the carne asada fries!! They always have such big portions and yummy helpings of sour cream, avocados, cheese and salsa!

I will not eat breakfast or dinner just to pig out on this glorious place for lunch! Almost everything on the menu is guaranteed to be good.. let me re-phrase that to \"so darn good you will toss and turn in your sleep from guilt!\". 

I would also highly recommend their rolled taquitos, yummy! 

Warning: This place is very dangerous because of the fact that it has a drive through and is very easy access food. Thoughts of Filibertos throughout the day and the temptation of the drive through will haunt you!! lol :)

5 stars!! :D"}
{"text":"I have eaten a countless amount of breakfast burritos from this Fili-B's location and they are always big hot delicious gut bombs of love. Evertime my parents come to visit we have to come here for some breakfast. Their Arizona burrito is also really good. Me likey."}
{"text":"I like all the filibertos and eat at them frequently. They have great breakfast burritos! However, this location seems to be better than most for lunch. I am never disappointed here. It's fun to play mistery burrito. They have all these burritos named for different southwestern states and it's not posted what  the ingredients are. Everytime I order one it's a delicious surprise. I love me some Fili-B's"}
{"text":"First time at this Filiberto's. Have always had good food and decent service at the others. This one was no exception. 

Arrived around 7:30PM on a Sunday night and I noticed that the place was different than all the others. This place had seating for about 40-50, salsa bar, condiment bar and chips/sauce bar. Nice touch. 

My wife ordered the rolled taco plate with all the toppings on the side. I got the Adobado plate but with no beans (date night ya know). She enjoyed her tacos. Crispy tortillas, flavorful meat and fresh toppings. The rice was exceptional, compared to other Fili B's. 

My Adobado was unctuous. It was juicy and seemed to have some extra flavor that I couldn't describe. My wife took a bite and wasn't fond of it but she also couldn't describe the taste. 

I recommend this Filiberto's for its savory dishes, good atmosphere and efficient service."}
{"text":"The food was a mess it was one wrong thing after the other and this is the second time I have had a issue here they don't even care!!! If they had no stars they would diff get that!!! It's so quite in there no music no Ac on and especially don't like the fact that I paid for a burrito and got a taco sized burrito they are very cheap very!!! The burrito looked like my two year old would even be for-filled  with it. Horrible service!!"}
{"text":"It was really late a night and it still took a while for the drive thru service lane to move food was not excellent just good will probably won't visit again unless I'm drinking and crave something late at night."}
{"text":"I used to come here several times a week but won't after my experience this morning. I shouldn't get attitude because I wanted my burrito remade after it was falling apart and barely had any beans in it. She gave me someone else's bean and cheese burrito which wasn't falling apart but still had barely any beans in it. $6 for bean and cheese burrito is ridiculous as it is and beans aren't even that expensive. Not to mention when I told her what was wrong with my burrito she touched it with her bare hands. Then asked if I wanted more beans in it I said no I want it remade. I use to this chick was nice. Think she's a manager too."}
{"text":"Ordered super nachos and it came with mystery meat. They said it was chicken but I had my doubts.  So I asked for a new one and they gave me a tiny one with a teaspoon of carne asada and very little cheese & toppings. Very disappointed. I threw most of it away and left."}
{"text":"The carne asada is hit or miss on flavor, depending on the cook. The tortillas are usually dried out and burnt as well. Portion sizes here are way smaller, compared to other Filibertos.  For example, we ordered a pint of rice, paid for a pint and it was less than half full when we opened it. Hopefully they get their act together."}
{"text":"Well in the end not all Filiberto's are alike. 

I came here for a late lunch, around two-thirty. The outside had a modern look, similar to the one on Indian Bend, near the 101 Loop. 

Once inside, I noticed the walls were bright and freshly painted (photo).  The seats however were dilapidated. Almost every single one was ripped, with exposed cushions and springs. One had a jagged piece of metal sticking in the air.

The food on the other hand was good standard Mexican fair. I had two huge bean burritos, which were filling and made on a flaky grilled tortilla.  They were only $5.28 before tax. 

There is nothing wrong with the food, or the employees. They were all very nice and friendly!  Too bad they have to work in such a dump. 

The owner needs to blowout the seating and take a little more interest in the store!  

I might be back, but only at the drive-thru window.  I should have gone to Los Betos across the street. Ugh!"}
{"text":"I used to like their shredded beef tacos, but I soon realized the amount of grease that they use in their tacos is horrendous. I've woken up one too many times with a stomach ache at night due to eating them. However, their breakfast burritos are pretty good and so are their chicken tortas. I would not eat their carne asada at all."}
{"text":"This is the second time I go here and I have to wait 20-30 min for my burrito because they forgot I ordered, and talk about adding insult to injury they asked me \"what did you order\" that goes to show you how long I waited."}
{"text":"99 cent tacos on Tuesdays, Wednesday special is their chimichanga with rice & beans and a drink for $4.99. The chimi is normally $8.99. Shared it, both of us had  plenty for lunch."}
{"text":"First time at this Fili B's. My first impression: the place is clean, organized and well laid out. They have a good salsa selection but sans Carrots and Peppers. Sad day. The menu board looks very good. Definitely an upgrade from most Fili B's. 

I ordered five orders for take out. I had to make several changes due to various allergies and all orders were done right. 

I got the Adobado Plate, which consists of marinated pork, pico de gayo, lettuce, beans and rice. It was scrumptious. It's easy to over cook since it's such a small dice but mine was rich and flavorful. 

I'll be back."}
{"text":"My best friend paid $450.00 to have their food for her daughters wedding.  Let me tell you, it was the worst!!!  The meat was extremely dry, the beans were runny, and they gave us NO tortillas!!!  The employees were pretty rude, they kept looking back at us and whispering to each other. There were only 2 employees that spoke proper English.  It was really disgusting the way we were treated, especially since I know we were the biggest sale they had all day!!!   I wouldn't recommend that store to my worst enemy!!!  I have to give them a star rating but in all honesty they don't deserve any stars at all!!!"}
{"text":"This Filiberto's gets a bad wrap ( pun) I'm not sure why.  I've eaten here several times in the past few months and it's been consistent, friendly, and good.  Just had some tacos Tuesday night.  Packed with meat, cheese, and lettuce, with salsa cups that were kept nice and cold to ensure freshness.  Tasty.  The drive through employee is easy to understand through the speaker and speaks very clearly."}
{"text":"They messed up my order and then asked me to come back.  I was already pissed cause the food gets cold instantly.  I get there and they wanted the old order.  I was already pissed and didn't want to make another trip so I just payed again but that's officially the last time I eat here.  I go there almost 3 times a week but after this... Fuck them!"}
{"text":"Just ordered $30 in food there and found a full size roach stuck to a chip in my nachos. Took them back to get a refund and showed the girl. Her first response - \"guys, there would be food all over it\" - as if we put the roach in there and pulling a fast one. Trying to say we are lying about it. Issued a refund but hasn't gone back on the card yet. Refund or not, I'm calling the health department and maybe the news. So gross, disgusted for life now. Thanks for ruining nachos for me and not believing me when I bring it to your attention. I hope this place shuts down."}
{"text":"This location is most convenient to me but it just doesn't live up to the same quality and service as the other locations in the valley. came here the second time and they screwed up my order again."}
{"text":"The food is not that great or cheap. I've tried the nachos, rolled tacos, and enchiladas. My husband usually gets a burrito.  Without fail the food always upsets our stomachs, but we keep going back. Not sure why.  The green sauce is good. Service is always good too."}
{"text":"WORST FILIBERTOS EVER. They seriously just tried to charge me 6.50 for two beef tacos! This filibertos menu and their prices as well as quality of food has always been subpar to the majority of filibertos in the valley. Their food was always about 70 percent as good as other Filibertos I've been to but now charging so much it's definitely not worth the visit. Most other filibertos in the valley charged a 1.99 for a taco. I could have gotten this in a combination plate for 6.50,  same chain all other locations. This restaurant won't be around for long if they keep this up"}
{"text":"Got charged $9.99 for a Super Nachos, with tax $10.57. Ya, there was a lot of food in the box, but you know what, i'm not going to pay you sit down restaurant prices for a fast food drive thru experience, it's just not gonna happen."}
{"text":"This pace is OK food is decent! 
BUT the other day We went (because I injured my arm) and I didn't want to cook! I got The taco plate got my husband the bean and cheese burrito and as I was eating my Taco omgosh The meat tasted funky and my husband put Red Chili on his burrito and he was like gross!!
I tasted the chili and it was bad!!! 
we go here every so often and this was the 1st time WE WERE VERY DISAPPOINTED!! we threw away the food and got Chinese food Panda! 
you need to be careful someone could get food poison! 
Throw away the old please!! and make Fresh Chili sauce 
thank you 
ps this was strike 1"}
{"text":"I was starving and wanted something quick and cheap. Based on reviews, I was dubious about coming here but a chicken taco sounded really good. I decided to live wild and try it out. 

A happy surprise was that it's taco Tuesday so I was able to get two soft tacos for $.99 each! I expected them to be measly but there was enough meat in it that one would've been plenty. Better yet - they tasted good enough that I ate both. (Or maybe that's worse because I'm quite full now). 
The iced tea was fresh, restaurant was clean and cheerfully decorated. They had a bar with four salsas, traditional veggies etc. 

I could've taken pix to show how much meat was in the tacos but instead, I ate them."}
{"text":"Worst service i have ever had at a filabertos. I wanted to make a subsitute in my burrito and she said its not allowed. Theyve done it at other locations i think she just didnt feel like doing it. Everyone just was staring at us and they were super rude. My boyfriend got a burrito with a side of rice and beans and they put it INSIDE the burrito. We went back up and they put it on the side in literally the smallest cup they could find. It was the size of a salsa cup. Thats ridiculous. But we didnt say anything to avoid causing problems. And based on other reviews on the site they dont take well to complaints. The salsa bar was absolutly disgusting. You could tell everything was left out til the end of the night and mixed with water for the next day. The carrots looked brown and mushy. I got a burrito and it was literally dripping in grease. I feel so sick now. Not even the soda tasted good. if you are thinking about going to this location DONT. SAVE YOUR MONEY THERES ANOTHER LOCATION ON 35TH AND SOUTHERN THAT WILL TREAT YOU MUCH BETTER. i will be calling the health department over this store. I cant imagine people wasting away there money here to get sick. And employees clearly dont care. I can only imagine what the back looks like."}
{"text":"This location is great. I'm a regular customer (at least once a week) and the food is consistently good, employees are friendly and prices are cheap! I especially enjoy the daily specials...which are approx $1.50 each... Monday's special: 3 rolled tacos with cheese. Tuesday's: Bean tostada. The list goes on... I also LOVE the bacon breakfast burrito.  I highly recommend this Filiberto's location."}
{"text":"Chorizo is very greasy and nasty. The only good thing I've gotten from this location is the green chile burrito which is excellent. I normally don't get pork burritos, but these are restaurant quality. Plus, they have a drive-thru which many taco places don't have."}
{"text":"What a mistake. I ordered rolled tacos with guacamole and it looked like Kermit the frog  had diarrhea on my rolled tacos. You call that guacamole? It was so watery. Guacamole should resemble avocados. 

The beans were disgusting as well. I'm from San Diego and I'm getting convinced I will never find good Mexican food in Arizona."}
{"text":"Hot sauce has no flavor, taste like watered down ketchup.  Shredded beef Tacos and tostatas have no flavor.  Won't go back to this s location, it was terrible."}
{"text":"If zero was an option this place would get -4 stars. It is typically slow but tolerable cause it's pretty tasty but no more!! I just returned home after having left a drive thru for the first time ever without my food. I waited 13 minutes and 1 car had gotten food and there were 4 cars ahead of me...4 ahead of me!!! I know they wouldn't claim to be fast food but nobody has time to wait 40 minutes in a drive thru. Go down to 35th Ave."}
{"text":"Not the best Filiberto's location. Its clean and there is plenty of seating but the service is slow. The location is kind of hard to find since it's in the back corner of a shopping complex and not on a major road."}
{"text":"I've eaten at several Filiberto's locations around the East Valley but this one does not get a high rating from me. I've received food at a full service restaurant faster than this fast food location. Most of the tables in the facility were dirty. The condiment bar was empty of all selections except for salsa and was dirty. Next time, I'll opt for the Garcia's across the street."}
{"text":"Ok so I have been coming here for more than a year. In the morning the food is great. Now mind you I get the burritos so that is all I can comment on. The Salsa is great as well! This is the cleanest Filibertos I have been to not only that they are quick. Call in your order tell them how long and it's ready by the time you pick it up. 
The reason for the no 5 star I can't find them on the darn Google search it's only on Yelp."}
{"text":"We stopped in for a snack and wanted to try something standard to see how they were.   So we did one chicken taco and one steak.   We didn't specify anything and they didn't ask... So we ended up with chicken on a hard shell and steak on corn.   This may be their standard...I don't know.   The steak was fair but the chicken was really good - if you like salty and I am one of those people that like salty.   The red and green sauces were good and spicy.    The steak needed it."}
{"text":"Another Filibertos near the homestead....score!!!  As stated in previous reviews, this is a newer location with very effecient service.  Just when I didn't think their glorious food could get any better, I tried a new burrito today, the ADOBADA is the bomb!!!!!  Tender chunks of marinated pork in a reddish spicey (and somewhat tangy) sauce, homemade guacamole and shredded cabbage wrapped in 36\" of mexican goodness.  

Now, where did I put the Tums?"}
{"text":"I'm one of those 75/25 eaters.  I try to eat healthy 75% of the time and I would be happy eating at Filibertos the other 25%!  I must have Latin blood in me because I CRAVE this food!!!  I've had dreams about greasy mexican food like this!!!  Seriously, the green chile burrito is the BOMB.  And I swear, it's not even that greasy....just delicious morsels of pork in a perfect green sauce and not too spicy (I have acid reflux, so this place can create serious pain!)   Where can you get such an authentic, delicious meal for $4.00?  I know I'm a fan :)"}
{"text":"OK. So I'm not giving this Filiberto's five stars simply because it's a Filiberto's. But I'm giving it four stars because (after two visits) it seems to be consistent, clean and pretty damn awesome.

After numerous disappointing visits to other valley Filiberto's because of gross amounts of meat in my country burritos and incorrect orders, I decided to give this location a try because I recently started working nearby. I'm diggin it.

The country burritos are near-perfect and the hot sauce is always fresh. It's always well-staffed, too.

BONUS: They have different 99 cent specials every day of the week, and you can choose any of them on Friday!

I'm still going to remain skeptical of most other Filiberto's locations, but I'd say this one is going to see my at least twice / week for a while (for better or worse). I need my hot sauce fix! What can I say?"}
{"text":"Late night snack...time for carne Asada fries with pico. Yummmm. We were looking for a quick bite after running around all day. We've had every ethnic food around the past couple of weeks so just needed something fast and filling. Not looking for a salad. The asada fries are what's up!"}
{"text":"The best breakfast burrito EVER! It was fluffy and fresh and done to perfection. I ate in 4 award winning Mexican restaurants in Phoenix and that burrito out performed everyone of them."}
{"text":"this place is really good!!!! their carne asada fries are my fave! it's the best comfort food after a long night of partying and they are open 24/7 which is awesome!"}
{"text":"The drive tru takes forever and the price is so high but the quality of food is telling something else! Its good place if you're hungry at the middle of the night. Or when you're drunk. But for a Mexican place its a no go"}
{"text":"Almost never disappoints. It is a guaranteed good burrito or fish tacos."}
{"text":"Priced Decent, Quantity Heavy. Just ordered a side of chips and got almost a pound of chips. I love chips and salsa, but this was too much than i thought. Anyway the food was good and seems to have a authentic Mexican flavor to it. Worth a short once, particularly if you are pretty hungry."}
{"text":"The California Burrito was the worst burrito I have ever had.  All time.  #1.  Oh yeah, and it was the most expensive one too.  All those ones in CA included.  Well I guess its a sign to make better food choices for 2017."}
{"text":"After telling my boyfriend I didn't want to go to or eat food from Filiberto's again for concerns of expanding my waistline, he suggested we hit the drive thru. We'd been coming back home from Tucson and it was kind of late to go anywhere or bother with cooking anything at home. I'd never actually been to Filiberto's and have yet to step inside the place.

We went through the drive thru and the guy taking our order was patient even though my boyfriend had no idea what he wanted -- just that it had to be from here. I got the same as last time: egg & potato burrito with cheese and a side of rice. He eventually decided on the fish taco combo meal. We pulled up to the window and the food was ready in just a couple of minutes. 

We took everything home and ate. Maybe because we hadn't eaten for several hours or because it really is so heart-attack-inducingly good, but it hit the spot."}
{"text":"I go to Filberto's for Taco Tuesday.  .99cents which is a great deal.  They are really good!
The restaurant is always clean and the staff are 
always friendly."}
{"text":"First Filly b's in AZ best Tamarindo and breakfast tacos!"}
{"text":"After hearing a few individuals talk about Filibertos at work I thought I would give them a try.  Sadly to say after 3 different meals and visits to their drive thru I have to report the food is beyond edible or palatable.   On two occasions the beans and rice were disgusting.   I attempted the chicken quesadillas were sandwiched between two massive tortillas with queso slop not cheese, the chicken tasted like canned chicken that had not been opened in years.  Instead of putting sour cream and guacamole on the side it slopped on inside which added to a even sloppy mess.  The flavors were so bad that this expensive mess had to be just thrown out.  With all the options there are for Mexican food....runnnnn to somewhere else.  Serrano's was heaven compared to this place."}
{"text":"This store is in the old Churches building close to home on the SE corner of Power and McDowell.  Had a breakfast bacon burrito this morning and had good service through the drive through.  I added potatoes to the burrito but it stilled lacked flavor (did have a lot of bacon in it and that didn't help either).  I added two of the hot sauces and it was enough.  This location has been open for about 2 years now, seems steady busy.  Food and a drink for $7, wasn't worth it.  Had no taste..."}
{"text":"Their breakfast burrito came with raw bacon and sour cream that tasted like it expired along time ago."}
{"text":"This was possibly the worst Mexican food I've had since moving to AZ 2 yrs ago!  Overpriced and just BAD tasting.  Chicken quesadilla was soggy, and chicken tasted gross.  Beef tacos were $3.29 each and were not good at all."}
{"text":"Food is pretty tasty. The dining room was pretty messy but it is almost 2am with only 2 workers. Good place for a late night fix."}
{"text":"As all the reviews say, LATE NIGHT (after hours of drinking) and it's 2am and you are desperate for cheesy, greasy goodness....siiigh. I love you Fili-Bs! 

DISCLAIMER: Will cause massive diarrhea within 24 hours of consuming."}
{"text":"Poor service in fact they are rude! Food portions are small! Skip them! Ordered chicken salad and couldn't find the meat atop some wilted lettuce!"}
{"text":"Pretty sure I just saw the lady who taking the drive thru order licked her fingers and got pickled veggies for a customer with her bare hands....

Burritos are good, carne asada fries suck.. It's crinkle fries not regular ones..."}
{"text":"I am impressed with this Filiberto's.  And, I believe Heather C has it right -- \"Mexican food the way my god intended it to be....huge portions and dirt cheap!\"

Sorry, normally I don't begin a review by quoting another Yelp'er and in this case a friend as well.  Up until a years ago, we had never been to a Filiberto's before and found the food genuine and good.  

Another positive working in it's favor, is that Filberto's runs variety of specials during the week (see photo).  Like Taco Tuesday and Bean Burritos Thursdays.  

I view Filiberto's as a restaurant that someone from Mexico would start, after eating at a Taco Bell.  Heck, I even thought about doing it.  LOL  Which I imagine, was the original story behind it; and lo and behold: 

\"In 1986, Flavio, Aurelio, Francisco and Filiberto Tenorio had a vision of opening an authentic fresh Mexican food restaurant. They successfully opened their first one in San Diego, California, and they named it Filiberto's  In 1993 Filiberto's opened its first best Mexican fast food restaurant in Mesa, AZ.\" http://www.filibertos.com/ajax/kitchen.html

Recently we were shopping at nearby Lamps Plus and Home Depot and decided to have dinner.  Funny thing, one of us wanted a burgers, while another wanted a burrito. So I took mine to go and met at McDonald's across the parking lot.  Funny but true.  Several of the employees nodded their approval.

So, a Three and a solid Half Star \"A-OK\" rating, just short of Four Stars.  I'll see you in the parking lot."}
{"text":"Hey, we know what we're getting with Filiberto's... cheap Mexican grub in large quantities! Some Filiberto's are clean and somewhat nice, this location definitely isn't one of them.  The dining room was dark, grimey and dingy, the tables are too high for the bench seats, and whats with only turning on a single light in the entire space???  The restaurant had a weird odor ( I probably don't want to know what it was) and our food was all extremely over cooked, probanly spending an entire day under the warming lights because most people have abandoned this location.  Every single thing in the restaurant was worn out and dirty. Time to spend a few bucks on a rehab or close this dump down. What a waste of a meal!"}
{"text":"As soon as they opened we started going there. The food is great! However, the service is terrible. The past three times we've paced pick up orders they've been wrong, charged us extra, or are completely missing items that were ordered. Tonight they shorted me a taco. When I came back and told the pay working the register they do stuff like this allot. All she could say was sorry. The staff needs to get it together!"}
{"text":"I've been coming here for years I know the owner and always great customer service !! Taco  Tuesday hands-down the best spot!"}
{"text":"Terrible. It's worse than Taco Bell! Mom and I ordered chicken tacos. Took one bite and spit out. Absolutely disgusting. Perhaps something vegetarian would be better. The meat was questionable to say the least. The bathrooms were also filthy and smelled like excrement. Would never return."}
{"text":"I found a piece of square orange hard plastic(1/2 thick, 1 inch in size)in my cheese crisp. Looks like a lid. How the hell you miss that cooking. What if a child was eating it!  Child could have chocked"}
{"text":"What happened to this place! It's been a while since I stopped in but it was most likely the last. The staff seems uninterested and depressed. It took an eternity to get our food. Apparently drive thru has priority, so we had to wait about 15-20 minutes. The prices have skyrocketed. I ordered a California Burrito and was shocked it was $7.50! I asked for guacamole on the side instead of inside, I didn't get it at all. Also missing from my burrito was cheese and pico. I asked for the pico and she said it was $1 more!  I basically got a scoop of old cold carne asada and a few undercooked french fries (yes I said french fries). It was gross. Also the chicken in my wifes tacos was dry and flavorless. This place used to be good at one point. Someburros and Cafe Rio are right down the street, I can get a much better and fresher burrito for the same or cheaper cost. No need to come back here."}
{"text":"Always good fresh food , especially a night of partying you got to stop at filibs!!!! I love the carne asada fries , country burrito , wish they had menudo Friday nights !"}
{"text":"This is the worst Filibertos Mexican Restaurant ever! Being a guy that just came out of work and was really hungry, i decided to eat here. While at the drive thru i ordered a steak and egg burritto with cheese. A meal that costs 7 dollars. The cashier ran my credit card and me without noticing it, he charged me $83. I was beyond furious about the situation. When i had contacted them if i could talk to a manager, an employee just kept on hanging up on me after saying \"filibertos how may i help you.\" I actually had to go to the store and confront them about it and still they couldnt help me. The meals they serve is always cold and the wait time here is also ridiculous. Dont ever come to this restaurant. If i could give them a negative star, i would but one star is the lowest. Hell they dont even deserve a star. I just want my money back that they took!"}
{"text":"I normally come here on Wednesdays after I get out of school for their 99cent bean burritos. I've had some decent luck with this location but it's all at complete random chance.  Tonight I ordered a couple of bean burritos and a quesadilla.  When I got home the tortillas were stale and hard as a rock.  You had to peel off half of it because it was just too dry to eat.  I personally think that it's unacceptable for a cook to make multiple burritos and wrap them in tortillas that are obviously meant for the trash can and not for customers. 

There are also days when I go here and order the same thing and they are fresh as can be.  Super soft and taste like they were just made.  I don't know what I expect from going to a berto though.  It's always a chance to get really bad food or really good food.  

You know you can't call and complain because odds are no one there will care enough to do anything about it or they won't be able to understand English over the phone."}
{"text":"Supposed to be 24 hour drive thru, but everytime I go, I get zero service. Won't ever go to this location again."}
{"text":"Ordered Carne Asada  fries from this place, and they were  so gross! Meat tasted like it had been sitting around for a while, the fries seemed like they were barely cooked, and there was barely any guacamole or sour cream to mix with the fries. I basically paid 8 bucks for crappy fries with minimal flavor lol."}
{"text":"9616 W Van Buren St, Tolleson, AZ 85353
I got food poisoning after eating the street taco's special. I placed my leftover in the fridge to eat for breakfast the next and the onions developed white/black hairy mold overnight. my guess is because they were not freshly prepped the same day. it was gross and a waste the meal price was $9 per meal."}
{"text":"I don't know what people are complaining about. This place is amazing! Look, when you go here you have to understand it is not gourmet nor is it healthy. That being said it is damn delicious. Get the California burrito with red and green salsa. Amazing!"}
{"text":"One of my favorite fast food authentic Mexican places. I always try to get there when I'm in Phoenix. Love their fresh corn tortillas... mmmmm"}
{"text":"24 hour drive up is handy in a town that shuts down at 11pm. The burritos here make Sonic and McDonalds burritos look like toothpicks. The best things are prices are low and serving sizes are plentiful. I highly recommend Filibertos..."}
{"text":"I have been eating at the berto's places for as long as they've been around. This location is one of the better stores! Today I had the best thing I've ever had at any Berto's ever. They have a New Mexico Burro at this location, which is a red or green chili burro, with queso sauce on top. I had the green chili, and it was fantastic!!! I will be back this week to try the red chili version, since the other was so good. 

I hope this is something the other stores pick up on. 

The only reason they don't get 5 stars is due to the plastic silverware they use. It's the real cheap soft plastic crap, and almost impossible to use."}
{"text":"This is one of the nicer stores in their chain. They food is good most of the time for fast food Mexican. We stop in a few times a month, since it's just down the street from us."}
{"text":"I have been to MANY of the stores in this chain, and this is the WORST store they have. I live very close to this location, and have been going here since they opened. It's never been as good as most of the other stores, but in the last 2 years I have not had one good meal from this store. I went in today for Taco Tuesday, and Tacos are hard to screw up, but they did. I had a beef and a chicken Taco, and in both the meat had a very bitter taste. The beef taco looked like the meat was scraped from the dried parts on the edge of the grill. I've had beef jerky that wasn't as dried out as the meat in my taco. 

I'll never set foot in this store again. I'll drive the extra 3 miles to the store on Ray rd that makes better food. This store needs a new owner, and new management."}
{"text":"This is not quite 5 star, but it IS a solid 4 star most of the time. They built a newer store on Chandler Blvd that is closer to my house, but I have started going back to this location because they seem to make better food. Their salsa bar is not as good though, they do not have as many things in the salsa bar. 

I love the extreme Fajita burro if I'm real hungry, and the Green chili pork is pretty good as well. The Carna Asada is usually a little over cooked for my liking, but many people like it. Their Chicken Chimi is worth a try."}
{"text":"I really was not happy with them first off i went through the drive thru and just ordered 2 things and they forgot one so I have to park my car and go back in and get it. Then it took them forever to get my food also I waited like 5 minutes before anyone noticed me at them he front counter. Just not going to this location ever agian."}
{"text":"Rude chick working the cash register/front.  Clearly had a hickie on her neck, which is tacky in itself.  Any time I've come here on Saturday morning for Menudo, it's never ready.  Almost 10 am mind you.  I didn't have much time for my work break, else I would have definitely eaten somewhere else."}
{"text":"Always good...even when its not 2 am after a night of drinking with friends. I always get the same thing. AZ burrito and a large  Mexican juice of some kind."}
{"text":"Pluses - Holy indoor seating Batman! Overall the food is good - up-to-par with the other locations. The free chips and salsa is a nice touch.
Minuses - The Arizona burrito specifically is not quite as good as other locations and the wait was realllly long. 
Summary - Definitely worth a visit if you have time and don't want to eat in the heat or the car."}
{"text":"Last time I went they had a new item that was just written on some paper by the register- Potatoe Tacos!!

Fried squares of potatoes (think breakfast) placed in a tortilla shell and then deep fried.  Topped with queso and lettuce.  Yum!  Yum!  Yum!  It was so delicious.  Nothing what so ever healthy about it but it tasted like salty, greasy heaven."}
{"text":"Got 3 rolled tacos which were nothing special. Tasted like rolled tacos you can buy in the frozen section. But what happened to the cheese? I will leave a pic. 
Any topping like guac, sour cream they are extra. I  can say this WAYYY OVER PRICED! One taco is 4.99, are you kidding? I would not come back or recommend it to others."}
{"text":"I ordered a shredded beef burrito today for lunch through the drive thru and was disgustingly surprised to find that there were 3 leaves cooked into my burrito. Leaves like what you would see on a tree out side... not seasoning leaves by any means. I kept feeling some different textures as I was chewing and opened my burrito to find them. Check your food before you take a bite!"}
{"text":"The fat lady with the flour make up that try to cover her pimples is either blowing the owner or black mailing him.. How is this lady still here??? She fucking sucks! I will be calling her manager in the morning. Horrible experience.. I'll be sure to take a pic of her next time #newemployees"}
{"text":"I live very near this Filiburto's and have been going to there since the location first opened. They used be all good like any other Filiburto's. But the cost for adding/exchanging fillings varies greatly and the quality has fallen off sharply. 

Sometimes it cost $ 1.50 more to substitute pork in a Chimichanga meal. Other times they charge me for a pork burrito (which I don't get) and put the meat from the burrito in the Chimichanga. They often cook their chile relleno burrito's wrong. They are just greasy and there is no breading. My guess is the oil was not hot enough. And sometimes the meat in the pork burrito's is crunchy. And it's not supposed to be crunchy. 

They also do not understand their own menu options. I wanted to get two chile relleno burrito's with enchilada sauce and cheese on top. It is a menu option. I paid for two chile relleno burrito's and extra to make them like enchilada's. And they gave me two chile relleno with enchilada sauce on them. No burrito's, just relleno's with sauce on it. When I went to the counter they said. \"That's how we do them.\"

I used to go to this Filiberto's twice a week. They knew my voice on the phone and knew what I was going to order. But I have been disappointed in the product too many times to go back. I still like Filiberto's. But the others are a little more out of my way. So I don't buy Filiberto's very often anymore.  Very disappointing."}
{"text":"Always have to go to a Filiberto's when I'm in Phoenix. Love their fast food Mexican food. Fresh corn tortillas are super tasty. Although I've never had a bad thing from them."}
{"text":"You may wonder what makes Filiberto's so good. So here is a list:

Breakfast Burrito CHECK!
Carne Asada Burrito CHECK!
Super Nachos CHECK!
Horchata CHECK!

And the food is so cheap its insane!

Not to mention it is amazing. 

Also, see the pictures for the lovely seating. Look at that burrito!"}
{"text":"Really wanted some good Mexican food and had not been to this location in a few years. Ordered #20 - one Taco and one Enchilada with rice and beans. Large portions. Able to get lunch and dinner out of the one meal. Price has gone up, as expected. Food was very good.  Shout out to Diego who demonstrated excellent customer service and signed me up for the \"Belly\" tag reward program. Looking forward to my next visit."}
{"text":"My friends and I decided that this place would better serve our appetites over McDonalds across the street.  Long story short, we ended up tossing our food in the trash and cruising through the McD's drive through on our way out of town...Frickon sad.  
This place is dirty, the service is trash and the food is gonna get people sick!!! Send in Robert Irvine stat....This place is in trouble."}
{"text":"*update I had half of my burrito yesterday and had the other half today for lunch. A piece of potato fell out from my burrito onto my plate and had a hair on it! Looks like an eyelash or eyebrow hair BARF! I added the picture to the pics on here.

I agree with a lot of the other negative posters. They try and trick you a lot by not putting the meat in at all! Ordered an Arizona burrito except I asked for no steak but the shredded meat instead with NO egg. So I get home and its all egg and onion. ZERO MEAT not even one piece. I went all the way back from goodyear to avondale and opened up my burrito. I said why is there ONLY egg in my Arizona burrito and wheres the shredded meat? She then told me she got confused because the shredded meat normally comes with egg and I was like but I said NO EGG and how does that explain that there is ZERO MEAT and ZERO CHEESE IN HERE TOO? Anyway long story short waste of gas, I got an only egg and onion burrito but she ended up getting it fixed ."}
{"text":"Finally another option in Anthem for fast food Mexican food. So far, so good. Standard Filiberto's and good to go. If you are expecting fine quality cuisine, you have obviously never had fast food Mexican. They have a large menu that offers something for everyone and also very cheap kids meals which keeps the family cost down and is the big downside to other places in the area. The rolled tacos are very good and they don't skimp on cheese and guacamole. Their rice and beans are basic, yet delicious. No complaints!"}
{"text":"Great food good prices most of the time they are fast. They have good taco specials. The people are usually nice."}
{"text":"First of all!! I ordered my food from Ubereats, I ordered 4 rolled tacos with rice and beans, I have been going to Filibertos for 6 years I have NEVER had 1 issue! Until now!! This might seem petty, but at this point I am so pist. I was up charged by Ubereats to deliver my food by $7.00, the actual cost was of my food was $13.00, so total I paid $21.04. I KNOW that filibertos always puts salsa in my bag whether I ask or not red and green salsa. NO ISSUE. However, Joseph from ubereats delivered my food with no SALSA and no sprite! My food was cold!! So I seriously paid $21.00 to eat Mexican Food with no salsa and no drink!!! Really Filibertos?????!!!! Thanks !!!!"}
{"text":"awesome shredded beef tacos! Nice people.  Great weekday specials. 99 cent tacos on Tuesday are the bomb."}
{"text":"Everything tastes so fresh. .I got two fish tacos and a chicken burritos. .yummy yummy in my tummy..."}
{"text":"Horrible & Waste of Money!!! Walked in we were the only ones there and staff talking away with no greeting or acknowledge ment of us there.  Ordered the nachos supreme and a shrimp burrito. The nachos were cold with nothing even warm. The steak was gray from what appeared to have been boiled meat along with being rubbery and tough.  The worst part is that there was just absolutely no flavor at all!!! The shredded cheese was also not even melted. The beans appeared bad as they were almost white! Very very little scant serving of pico de gallo and sour cream. The shrimp burrito was falling apart from a red sauce leaking from the burrito and the shrimp was tough and over cooked.  No flavor in the burrito as well. The salsa bar had cucumbers and other items that looked to have been sitting out too long as they were limp and semi dried out. The chips that were out had heat lights but both were off causing the chips to be cold. They were also on the counter close to the restrooms and door entrance all open and uncovered. Huge waste of $20.00 and will never return."}
{"text":"In town on business and thought I'd try this place because it was quick and easy and there were several people eating here. The shredded beef in my tacos was extremely dry, burnt in fact, and tasteless. The fish taco was a good size but the fish was cold. The chips were chewy and the queso had a thick layer on top. In short, the food was poorly executed and the place was a mess. The only nice thing was the very helpful girl who took my order. Will not be returning."}
{"text":"Yuck worst food ever! This place makes Mexican food look bad! I had never had flavor-less food that I wouldn't even take if given to me for free."}
{"text":"Not impressed at all.  Food was flavorless, plates were served topped off and that made everything mix together and gross appearance."}
{"text":"Been a while since I've tried this place but it was really good. The chicken bowl was a great serving size and all white meat. I do takeout most days and it's pretty quick service."}
{"text":"The $5 lunch special is hard to beat, I tend to get the cheese enchilada plate and with an all you can eat chips and salsa bar you are set for $6. There are always other daily specials from tacos to tostadas and the staff know how to take care of you quickly. Lunch rushes can cause delay, but they are open when many other restaurants in the area are closed."}
{"text":"To start, the drive thru took way too long for my order. Not only did I have to repeat it several times it still ended up being wrong."}
{"text":"Suprisingly not too bad... and i didnt get sick... I just popped in to get a taco and bean burrito and it was very good and super cheap... this is almost like one of those taco stands you would find in mexico, but it is indoors... and they even had a \"vintage\" street fighter 2 video game... i have not seen one of those in like 10+ years... but if you want some food the same price as T-Bell but more of the real deal check it out..."}
{"text":"A decent option at 2 am, but there are definitely better places around the Tempe area. The food is usually mushy (dripping fat and other liquids out of the bottom of the burrito) and without enough spices. They do, however, have a chips container that is full sometimes. Nice to get these free with your burrito."}
{"text":"My breakfast burrito was dry. The potatoes overpowered the taste so you couldn't taste any chorizo whatsoever. In fact, I think they put chopped up chorizo flakes smaller than the size of bacon bits in my burrito. Bummer!  The eggs were overcooked and needed more cheese for flavor. Essentially, my chorizo, potato, egg, and cheese burrito tasted like nothing. The best part was the freshly made tortilla.. Thank goodness I love me some tortillas de harina - since that's all I could taste in my burrito anyway."}
{"text":"Good!!!  Decent Mexican food. I liked it so did my grandson. He looked at me and said \"this isn't Chinese\" super good."}
{"text":"Great burritos and the tacos are amazing. Very friendly and fast. Always a great spot to hit up for Mexican food."}
{"text":"Food is better than decent, prices are good (even better on daily specials).  It's super local and divey, which gives it charm.  I love the salsa bar concept, and the green guacamole salsa is the best (salty, too!)  Some reviews mention that there's sometimes no napkins or bowls... well there's only 2 people running the place at any given time so things happen.  I actually just go under the counter beneath the salsa bar and help myself if something is missing (sort of like at Circle K when you go into the cupboard to get a bun or something)  I feel bad that someone had an experience where they were made fun of in Spanish.  But the way I think, people are curious about differences, and sometimes they speak about it not knowing you will hear/understand them--if they intended to offend I'm sure they would have said it in English.  Anyway, I go here every couple of weeks on taco Tuesday and have a good time with my girlfriend.  

Let's recap...
The good: Pretty good food, great prices, quaint atmosphere, free salsa and chips.

The not so good: Sometimes understaffed, missing items/condiments from salsa bar, hole in the wall stripmall location, maybe they make fun of you/maybe not

Give it a try :)"}
{"text":"The Filberto's I am reviewing for is the same company, but located at the corner of Chandler Blvd and Kyrene. It is new so I could not find that location on Yelp.

So I recently moved to Chandler for a few months on an internship, from Southern California. So I know about good Mexican food. When I got here at 6:30pm on a Sunday night, I was the only customer. No more customers came in while I was here. I ordered two chiles rellenos for about $6. 
When the food arrived, there were two giant chiles rellenos covered in red sauce, cheese, pico de gallo, and guacamole and sour cream. They looked amazing. When I took a bite, the food was cold. Not room temperature cold, actually cold like they took the box out of the refrigerator. I figured it might just be the toppings, so I took a few bites deep down, and it was cold all the way through to the peppers. I took the box to the front, and the cashier gave it to the chef. They began to argue in Spanish. Unbeknownst to the chef, I speak some Spanish myself. He was saying that the customer should just take it home and reheat it, cause they don't have a microwave. Finally, he decided to throw the dish on the grill to try to reheat it, which any chef should know will causes chiles rellenos to fall apart. I guess they didn't have a toaster oven, convection oven, or salamander either. They informed me they would make me new ones.

Now, surprisingly, the first set of chiles rellenos actually had a very good flavor, for what I could perceive through the cold temperature. This second set they gave me were nearly burnt, crisped to a dark brown. They were about half the size of the first two, and had almost no cheese. The guacamole was cut way down in quantity. I must note though that they were hot.

So in a nutshell, do not ever go to this chain. Their recipes may be good, but they hire terrible chefs with terrible service. It is unfortunate this chain dominates the Chandler-tempe area for Mexican food."}
{"text":"Came in for some late night food and was not disappointed!  Love the supreme asada quesadilla!"}
{"text":"Noone here and the dining room is dirty.  Service is slow.  No ice in the fountain.  Food is below avg for mexican and over priced.  Don't bother."}
{"text":"I just moved to the area, first time eating at this location. Very polite and quick the only down fall I would say is the food isn't always the hottest. But over all it has been great."}
{"text":"Ordered the carne asada fries. Pretty good, really crispy fries. The red sauce wasn't very good though. Decent price. The place was small, but clean."}
{"text":"Love the food!!! Great prices AND available 24/7!!! They rock!!! Always great service and very nice staff at all hours. I've gone at all times during the day. They are very accommodating and will always make sure they will address all your needs. Their specials rock and we make sure to take advantage of them all!!! They keep the restaurant clean and always make sure to replenish any extra items needed. I would recommend this to anyone who loves true and authentic Mexican food. Great when you're needing to satisfy your hunger. Their salsa bar is superb and they make sure to keep it replenished. I absolutely LOVE their beef tacos!!! It is their special on Tuesday and everyday from 2-5pm. Please go and ask for these. You won't be disappointed!!! Their green sauce is the best, but you can also get the red sauce. Try it.....you'll like AND love it!!!

{"text":"Yummy food but especially good beans, friendly staff, and quick service. I've been coming here for years and am always satisfied."}
{"text":"Excellently prepared bacon in the bacon, sausage, egg and cheese burrito.  The flavor is super great, the quantity is surprisingly huge. The tortilla shell was steamed and soft with a nice flaky shell. Overall, I was skeptical, but I was left very happy. Definitely go here!!!"}
{"text":"I went to this Filiberto's this morning. I ordered a breakfast burrito with ham, eggs, cheese, onions and potatoes. Everything seemed okay until I was halfway through the burrito and found myself chewing on pieces of eggshells. I continued eating, avoiding the general area where I had found the eggshells, but found a little more a couple minutes later. I couldn't finish the rest. Also, the eggs weren't that good. I won't be coming back to this Filiberto's."}
{"text":"Love the 24 hour service! There's a filibertos right by my house but the extra 5 minute drive is worth it. This location actually prepares the food right it's not just sloppy and thrown together. Love the carne asada fries!"}
{"text":"Oh my gosh! The burritos are huge and delicious!!! So fresh and always super hot. Try the Carnitas Burrito. My favorite and so yummy!"}
{"text":"i was on this burrito quest last week. every day after painting i would stop by a different mexican food dive and try a burrito.  this is definitely one of the top states for mexican food (IMHO).

i remember seeing these \"berto\" burrito places popping up in phx (roberto's knock-offs) from san diego.

if you want a $4-out-the-door burrito the size of a tennis ball can, all meat and no rip-off filler (beans, rice, lettuce) then this is your place.  in a vain attempt to stave off my trigliceride killjoys, i ordered a chicken burrito.

when the server handed it to me out the take-out window the bag nearly ripped under the 2 lb. load (this was 1 burrito mind you)

as i commandeered my nissan frontier while simultaneously shifting, steering, signaling, pouring red and green hot sauce on the opening of the tree stump sized burrito and attempting to masticate the tender juicy shreds of fowl...alas, i was only able to consume 3/4 of the monster.

a feat that i could easily have done had i gone to any other burrito barn.  if you're a cheap-chinese like me and my wife, you can easily give her a 1/3 and you get 2/3 and be 90% satisfied (just go home and eat a peanut butter sandwich) and you're good to go.

way worth it

{"text":"Good'ol Fillyb's! This location is nice, clean and quick. Carne asada burrito is still great after all these years."}
{"text":"Siempre tengo problemas con este lugar no con la comida pero con el servicio al cliente siempre parece que quieren hacerte la vida imposible cuando pides algo especial como un burro de carne desebrada estilo carne asada como esta vez me dieron una tortilla con carne sin nada y la otra ves que pedi unos tacos de lengua me dijeron que no los podian hacer sin darle una razon. Los enpleados todavia son mejores pero la manager en ves de ayudarte cuando los empleados se equivocan los defiende y tiene una mala actitud aunque ellos esten mal. Es la ultima ves que ire a ese lugar lastima porque la comida esta bien buena."}
{"text":"A bit larger than your typical Filiberto's. Also, this one is very brand new and clean. It's located where the old Heart Attack Grill used to be. The food is probably just as bad for you, but a whole different cuisine, obviously. Greasy and delicious taquería fair, just like any other Filiberto's. Very nice staff. I'll be back...especially for Taco Tuesdays."}
{"text":"This Filiberto's location opened pretty stealthily in the Foothills over a year ago. I don't know how I missed it, but I just happened to look over and see this place the other day and was kind of dumbfounded, then excited! There really wasn't a good greasy style (not a dis) taqueria on my radar in the whole Foothills. Sure, we have plenty of \"fresh-mex\" and sit-down Mexican restaurants, but I don't know of any other authentic taquerias around. You know the kind that always puts way too much sour cream and guacamole on everything...and then you pretend to be concerned about it...while you gobble it all up anyway? That kind! And, yes, Ahwatukee has one now!

And perfect timing for this place to show up, because I was craving a Chicken Quesadilla something fierce last night. And, when I got it home I was NOT disappointed! The shear weight of this monstrosity was amazing! Loaded full of chicken, cheese, guacamole, and sour cream, not only was it delicious, but it was beyond filling! You know how people say, \"You could feed a family of 4 with all this food,\" well, you could feed a family of 4 with my leftovers alone! I could not finish. Too much. Very satisfied though.

You can't imagine how happy I am to have a place to grab a super burrito whenever I have the craving. And while I can't eat at places like this all the time, I do recommend that my fellow Ahwatukee-ans give this place a go on occasion too. It seemed pretty mellow for a Saturday night, and I don't want this Filiberto's going anywhere!"}
{"text":"Was visiting south tempe and was looking for mexican food for lunch. Looked for a sit down mexican restaurant on yelp and this came up. It's a fast food place with tables. Mom ordered shredded beef taco and chicken enchilada. Meat in taco was very dry. Enchilada sauce used too many tomatoes so it was acidic. Needed more red chilies. I had a rolled taco plate. It was ok, not bad nor exceptional. If it was a toss up between taco bell or filiberto's, we'll pass on both."}
{"text":"Not the cheapest, not the best, but it was open late on a Sunday.

the Nachos were good, from what I remember...

The drive though took FOREVER. I guess that might be a good sign at a Mexican food place though, if you know what i mean. 

if it was the only place again ( I cant believe Taco Bell was closed!) I would give it another go."}
{"text":"My friends and I have been to this place twice. Once on Friday March 13 and Sunday March 15. Enjoyed the food and the service. We didn't enjoy being harassed by a bar Paton there, Doug, to the point of being poked, yelled at, and finally disgusted enough to leave. I'm disappointed that the person in charge didn't control this patron. I wonder how often this guy drives away others. We would of liked to make this a regular spot while we are here enjoying spring baseball but we will not be coming back if we do not feel that we can enjoy ourselves without being harassed."}
{"text":"First time eating inside, always go through the drive-thru, but I have kids with me this time.  We happened to be looking for a few items at the Home Depot across the parking lot.  Stopped in for a quick bite as all they wanted was bean burritos.  We asked for plain bean burritos... such a simple and plain thing to make.  We got charged for bean & CHEESE burritos but didn't notice until they took a bite out of their food.  Kids weren't happy but were hungry and didn't want to wait.  The place looks like it was cleaned earlier but not maintained throughout the day.  Every single table was dirty.  Staff is friendly.  Food is okay for fast food and it takes care of the Mexican food craving."}
{"text":"Food was okay, a bit salty but still tasty. Food did smell a little weird but I didn't get food poisoning so I'm good!"}
{"text":"Very disappointing green chili. Very salty. Rolled tacos were very small; almost pure shell. Liquidy green sauce."}
{"text":"Not your average bar food selection and it IS NOT OVERPRICED.  The prices are very reasonable.  Maybe Buckeye residents don't get out of Buckeye very much, but a salmon & shrimp dinner for less than $15 is a great deal.  I don't know what a lot of these reviewers are talking about.  You can get grilled salmon with steamed vegetables and rice.  Most bars don't offer any seafood selections at all.  They have fried shrimp, grilled chicken, great burgers, delicious ribs, and excellent margaritas.  It's hard to believe the delicious food comes out of the same kitchen where they prepare the usual Filiberto's fare.  There are very few good places to eat in Buckeye, and the good places in downtown Buckeye are breakfast/lunch only.  You won't be disappointed if you eat here.  It is a small place, and it is a bar, so if you take your kids to a bar, you have to expect adults to be there doing adult things, duh......."}
{"text":"I originally wrote a review of the Chandler and Kyrene Fili's and somehow tagged this one.  This is a good Fili's.  During Lent they have fish tacos on special on Friday.  The food here is tasty and the size of dishes is fair.  The cashiers could use a little more training.  The best Fili's is at Guadalupe and McClintock.  This is tied for my second favorite -tied with  Ray and McClintock.  I know my east Valley Fili's."}
{"text":"I have been back to the store several times and it has gotten noticeably better.every now and then they are still a bit stingy but usually the portions are larger than they had been in the quality has improved. The staffing seems better trained and they've improved their salsa bar"}
{"text":"This is the best Filiberto's in town. The quality is still there, the burritos are still large, and there is free chips and five kinds of salsa. The staff is friendly and the store is clean. The daily deals are good but most of the burritos are delicious."}
{"text":"If I could choose less than one star I would. Filberto's is worse than methinks not!! Let me describe it another way - the food here is crap!! The prices are expensive and whom ever considers this Mexican food they deserve to get ripped off.

The beans on my plate were like a lump of paste. Wait paste has more flavor and texture. The Taquitos sucked because they were flavorless. The rice tasted like the cardboard box they came from. Very rarely do I throw food away. Normally I would take it with me to eat later but not this stuff. Should I go on - hell no, just don't go here. Go across the street to Taco Bell which really is not real Mexican either but at least it is edible!!"}
{"text":"My bf and I always order the carne asada fries from this Filiberto's in particular. We personally like the fries, perfect size and cut. The asada is also cooked well and taste so good especially with sour cream + guacamole + cheese. Sometimes there is a line in the drive way but they are usually pretty fast. I love their green and red salsa!  we also tried their rolled tacos and they're good too!"}
{"text":"Had dinner at this Filibertos last night and the food was horrible. Ordered the rolled tacos and received them soft and under cooked. Also ordered a cheese quesadilla in which the cheese was not fully melted and the sour cream/guacamole, that I paid extra for, was tasteless. Will NEVER eat at this establishment again and suggest you do the same."}
{"text":"Filibertos used to be good food but twice now at this newer location  we have been so turned off by the foods taste. The refrieds are just awful, Is it they are not using original recipes with lard. Just tasteless. I had the beef enchiladas and the meat was again was without any flavor and watered down. They must keep the meat hot in a water bath. UGH. Lastly, the red sauce was so weak too one should use taco bells sauce packs. 
It used to be long lines at Filibertos and I have yet to see them there. I am upset as they used to have real good food and now they appear to be stretching their dollar at the expense of losing customers.Me included. Guess I drive all the way to Central to an old favorite. Didn't want to drive far."}
{"text":"Not too impressed with the food. We ordered a number 19 and a chicken burrito. I've never had mexican food with cheddar cheese on it instead of the traditional white cheese before. It was very stringy and didn't melt in the enchilada. The chicken in the burrito tasted off, kind of like it was frozen first which was probably the case, and the tortilla tasted very different. Maybe other dishes would be better but we're moving onto the next place."}
{"text":"Unclean and very lazy employees the lady on the intercom made us come in to get the order said it couldn't be picked up through drive through WORST CUSTOMER SERVICE DO NOT GO HERE. Furthermore Taco Bell has more flavor than this dog food tasting trash!"}
{"text":"Amazing food, this is what good Mexican food is. Unfortunately the drive through is an Authentic Mexican drive throu.. Just don't eat there.. Trust me.. Bring a native. Unless you took Spanish in school.."}
{"text":"Food: Plain and tasteless. The carne asada fries were soggy and nothing had a flavor. It just tasted like a lot of sour cream and starch. A top ramen has more kick and spice then the fires or any of the burritos. It was also over priced for quality.

Customer Service: Terrible. We came at night when the lobby was closed so we wanted to eat in our car because it was raining and the seats outside were covered in trash and had trash all on the floor. While eating in our car an employee came out cussing at us and telling us to leave or else they were going to call the cops. We had no clue what he was saying because of the screaming. But he came out yelling again and cussing. We had no clue what was going on so we left. He could have told us what was going on and why we had to leave. All we did was sit there uncomfortable, confused,and worried. Another employee just sat there watching us. Funny part was there were two cop cars near us who saw us park and eat and they were fine with it. Honestly terrible people and service."}
{"text":"I'm posting this review as I'm sitting in the drive threw line.  It's been 20 minutes since I ordered and the line isn't moving... Service is slow."}
{"text":"This location is a pain in the ass! You want a burrito? Be prepared for them to take up to 30 minutes to figure out they didn't make your order.

I love Filiberto's and will start visiting a different location."}
{"text":"My $9 burrito/taco combo was crap. Burrito was an onion, green pepper bomb minus the beef. Save your money and go to Del Taco"}
{"text":"Don't waste your time here. The staff is inept. On several occasions I've ordered az burritos and received California burritos (the main difference being guacamole on the California, not the Arizona). After the third instance I even requested they make doubly sure they check to make sure there was no mistake. Behold guacamole, fourth trip back. If you do go here, make sure you leave enough time to take your food back and have it replaced. And be aware talking to a manager will not solve the problem. Do yourself a favor. Hit chipotle a mile down the road. Not recommended"}
{"text":"Cleanest Filiberto's ever? Probably.

This location is part of a collection of about ten Filiberto's in the valley. They offer everything you're used to see at Filiberto's, if you've never been then think of your typical taco shop menu.

I came here for lunch because I was craving a Filiberto's Carne Asada Torta. There was a line of about 20 people and two registers, the two cashiers were the quickest and most efficient cashiers I've ever seen at a taco shop... BRAVO for the customer service.

My torta came out, the carne was good and it was a solid combo of bread, meat, guacamole and beans. I'll be honest, it exceeded my expectations. Based on this one visit this is already my favorite Filiberto's location. I'm excited to try other menu items now.

One thing I thought was weird was that every seating option is for four people, I dined in alone so I felt bad taking up that much table space."}
{"text":"Hate 2 say had a breakfast burruito and a pound of something oozed out of it , so gave them the benefit of the dought and next time got a bean burrito and the cheese was like it was frozen , never again!!!!!!"}
{"text":"Dirty location and very high prices but they do have great daily specials.  The employees were nice but I won't be back to this location."}
{"text":"The customer service here is pretty good for a Berto's.  However, on this day, it took 15 minutes to make two cheese crisps !  

They did apologize for the wait but sheesh what happened ? Did they have to run to Food City to buy the tortillas and cheese ?

Ghetto dirty location but they have great deals and specials."}
{"text":"This place is large enough for large groups.  They 8 different flavors of agua frescas (flavored fruit water) they also have free chips with 4 different salsas. A large burrito, taco beans, beans , rice and unlimited chips with a water cost me 7.14 with tax.  They have kids burritos as well and several video games for the kiddos.  Truly one of the best Fili-B's (as us locals call it) in the valley.  What gives this Fili's 5 stars is that the INSIDE lobby is open 24 hrs.  7days a week, 365...That made me say WOW, and thus, my only 5 star review so far!"}
{"text":"Let me start by writing I love their breakfast burritos.   My wife and I went inside and ordered two.   We waited, and waited, and waiting.....    watching cars come and go through the drive through.  After twenty plus minutes, I went to the counter to inquire about my order - it was not ready.   I asked the clerk if drive through customers  get served first?  She did not respond, but the crowd of people inside waiting for their food were all nodding.  I asked for my money back which they promptly provided.   No apologies however, and the cook in the back was glaring at me which made me uncomfortable.   I will probably be back - through the drive..   They need to improve their customer service and processes.    We ended going to McDonalds and  we received our food promptly."}
{"text":"I'm a New Yorker in town for a few days and was looking for a good fish taco (a rare find in NY) when I came across Filibertos here on Yelp. I might not be the best judge but I've tried em in New Orleans, Austin and New York and these were the best so far. Nice fresh fillets of fried fish, along with big chunks of pork in my carnitas. Burrito.  2 fish tacos and the burrito along with a side of guacamole for under $11 bucks. Well worth the 8 mile drive from where I'm staying. That's my story and I'm sticking too it."}
{"text":"Filibertos not my first choice but being that its late at night not many choices,  anyways ordered carne asada burrito and it did not tasted good at all.   Probably last time at Filibertos or at least this location."}
{"text":"Best Filibertos on this side of town. They are a little pricey compared to others but they do have daily specials that offset that plus if you order from the Filibertos app then BAM you get three free rolled tacos with cheese! They also have combo meals that come with a free soda plus one free refill. I am stoked y'all I love great fast Mexican food and not have to bust my budget."}
{"text":"The drive thru lady was so rude and they gave us our wrong order. I ordered for carne aside burrito and they ended up giving me sour cream, cheese, and lettuce. I am deaf and they were closed for walk in so decided to use drive thru but they were disrespectful."}
{"text":"Thrilled that this place is now at Pavilions.  It is not only convenient, but extremely cheap and quick.  The food is fresh, and the portions are huge.  I was always scared of this type of place but am now a fan.  My only complaint is the drive thru is slow, but the service inside is fine.  Have actually found myself eating here weekly..."}
{"text":"If I could give this place less than one star, I would.  I ordered through Grubhub.  Paid for a California burrito and paid for extra sour cream.  Sorry, but I find burritos dry without sour cream..  I also ordered a fish taco, a shrimp taco, and a large raspberry iced tea.  I got Diet Coke(I don't drink much soda!), and no sour cream on my burrito which I was planning on taking to work.  I called the restaurant and they will only refund the sour cream and the drink.  I won't be eating the burrito without the sour cream so, I'm out the $$ for the burrito.  They do this all of the time and now, I remember why I quit ordering from this restaurant.  Do NOT, I repeat, DO NOT order from these guys unless you want to be forced to eat the wrong order.  This is just blatant inattention.  No customer service whatsoever...  Poor!  Poor!  Poor!!!!"}
{"text":"We decided to head to Fili B's because tonight we wanted good, inexpensive, and fast food. 

Berto's restaurants are quintessential to Phoenix, and have proven themselves time and time again. 

But to night there was no way I wanted to deal with an idiot waiter, crying kids or being too early for happy hour. ... Oh wait is Saturday, there are almost no happy hours. 

\"Three carne asada burros please,\" I ordered happily while I handed over my 10% off coupon I had received from the Fry's market earlier that week.  While we waited for our food, we helped ourselves to the clean \"fresh salsa bar\".  There was, and always is, an assortment of salsas, pickled carrots, pickled onions, pickled jalapenos, fresh onion, fresh cilantro, lemons and yes of course plenty of warm chips all waiting for you to help yourself to. 

Tonight whoever was building the burritos had a heavy hand with everything, these were huge burritos... and to think we were going to split the third burrito. 

With our bellies full and wallets fat we left with a smile, thanks FiliB's for coming thru again."}
{"text":"I  asked  the  server  it  there  was  lard  in  the  bean  burrito  and  she  said \"No, only  beans\".   Now  I  found  out  that  she  lied  to  me,  they  are  actually  made  with  lard.   it  looks  like   Filibertos  does  not  even  publish  their  nutritional  information,  probably  for  a  good  reason."}
{"text":"Despite my bad first trip, I went back. Terrible. The beef taco meat was dried out, and without much flavor. My cheese enchiladas were full of unmelted cheese, and the entire dish was lukewarm at best."}
{"text":"I am just s sucker for a chips and salsa bar. This is the only location I am aware of with one.
Inside an ex McDonalds sits this Filibertos, on island in a decaying parking lot. The menu is standard for fast hole in the wall Mexican. This may not come as a surprise to my readers but I opt for the chili rellno burrito. I really like their take on it. It consists of the obligatory chili rellno but it is surrounded by guacamole and a tortilla, simple rich and oh so good.

As I stated before the draw of this location is the free chips at the salsa bar. The chips the usual well ground corn chips slightly warmed, but the free party really adds to the meal, on average I think I can add over 1000 calories for free to my lunch. 

Adding to the self serve fun this is one of the few locations with a soda fountain that you can access for free refills."}
{"text":"What happened? I used to love this place, but I had to throw my carne asada burro out! It tasted like the meat was undercooked. Blecch."}
{"text":"The Filibertos off of 52nd Ave and Baseline in Laveen, is absolutely disgusting. I live only a couple of blocks from this location, but will drive all the way down to the one off of 35th and Baseline because it's a thousand times better. The taste of the food varies from extremely bland to extremely salty ( I've tried quite a few things on the menu, trying to give them the benefit of the doubt due to being so close to my home). They are extremely skimpy with the cheese, the hot sauce is watered down & the \"guacamole\" ??? is not fit to be called guacamole. It would be great if there were some type of consistency between locations, but I suppose that would be asking way too much"}
{"text":"I used to come here a few years ago and they changed ownership and ever since than I have had nothing but bad experiences coming here the couples times i thought I'd  give in another chance.  The staffing is horrible, short toned speaking,  unfriendly greeting, they don't bother to interact with their customers.  The prices have jumped like crazy.  I remember getting a meal at $6 dollars now it's nearly  $9!! I will not be coming back or referring anyone to this location.  Not until something improves."}
{"text":"My favorite thing at Filiberto's has always been the breakfast burrito.  It comes with pico de gallo and its wonderful!  Today I went to this Filiberto's and got 2 breakfast burritos for my husband and myself.  Neither of them had the pico we love.  They were bland and we will not be going back to this location.  There are many more locations to choose from."}
{"text":"Not the best taqureria.I prefer amados late night or Rivas.but its close to my house after a late painting session or working in the garage,if you order simple you,ll be fine,preferably if you have a maxi can buddy to order for you,you probably wont get the squirts,haha"}
{"text":"Their $1.99 burritos are super delicious...especially the green chili pork..their salsas are seriously hot..can't wait to try more."}
{"text":"I love filibertos, I'll begin with that. BUT holy crap this place is absolutely terrible. Every time I come to this establishment it's like playing Russian roulette with my order. The communication skills of the workers at the drive through is at best, sub par. 

Although I had the most interesting drive through experience of my life here...when I pulled up to the window the lovely woman promptly asked if I was a stoner. She then began to try to bargain a discount for in exchange for any marijuana. Nice lady but super weird...and I was low anyways. 

I'll go back to my first comment that I absolutely love filibertos. After a long day of work all I want is my burrito and my order to be correct even after clarifying multiple times. 

Don't come here."}
{"text":"I'm at the point to where if I want anything I might as well ask them to give me whatever they feel like giving me that day. Why is it so difficult to get an order correct? Invest in monitors for the drive through along with a speaker and microphone that works. It's 2018, seriously Id expect more....or should I expect less now."}
{"text":"One of the best Mexican fast food there is! We visit here often and have not been disappointed yet! I recommend the super nachos in any form! The Red Chicken Quesadilla is great, a bit wet from how moist the meat is but still a must order. My kids LOVE the breakfast burrito and I have to say it is very good.

Want good and plenty then here ya go!"}
{"text":"I ordered the taco/enchilada combo. The rice, beans and taco was great (the taco shell seemed really fresh!), but the enchilada (my favorite Mexican staple) was drowning in sauce and cheese, and the sauce was extremely bland so it wasn't even enjoyable.

The portions were huge and the price was great. I'll go back, but not for an enchilada."}
{"text":"99 cent Taco Tuesdays! Yep this is why I come to this place. That and their super nachos should be illegal. I do find that their breakfast burritos are more expensive than other places which is weird because they all taste the same, so why almost a $1+ more? At any rate, Tuesday nights, me and Filberto's usually have a date :)"}
{"text":"Food is good. The owner, \"Manny\" is super nice, professional and out going. However the staff NEVER says thank you.  Or gracias. Or have a good day. EVER
I asked one about it today.  She says the management has gotten after her about it....but saying thank you just isn't her thing.    Hahaha.  True story."}
{"text":"I love Mexican food, so it's my mission to check out the Filiberto's, Poliberto's, Ramiro's etc of Phoenix and I can't stand when I go to the ones that are just okay. On my first visit, I had a Chicken Chimichunga combo meal and it was relatively good. I'd go so far as to give it 4 stars, based on that visit. Then today I returned to try their breakfast burritos. I decided on a bacon, egg and cheese burrito and added potatoes and onions. The cost of this was $7.30, which is a little pricey for a breakfast burrito, but not ridiculously so. The bacon was not cooked or crispy, but just like it comes out of a bag of crumbled bacon from Costco. Cold and flimsy. The potatoes were completely raw and talk about tasteless. Very. very disappointing.
Now, this restaurant only recently opened up, but I would encourage the owners to visit their competitor, Ramiro's, at 43rd Avenue and Bell and taste every darn thing on their menu. It is absolutely the best in the Phoenix Metro area. Best tacos, best everything, except the red sauce. There are at least 3 restaurants in their vicinity and they have a lot to learn if they want to compete with the others."}
{"text":"We decided to stop in with jr high girls basket team. Lol ordered 30 carne asada tacos, 15 carne asada burritos. And drinks. 
The staff did an awesome job! They handled our order very well. 
They did not skimp on any of the items we had ordered.
The quality and of the quantity was on point. 
The speed was amazing, considering the size of the order. 
And they were still able to take and expedite the other customers at the counter and drive thru. 
You guys did an awesome job. Thank you."}
{"text":"In all honesty, I'd give them a zero if I could. This place has gone downhill the past couple of years. The food is ALWAYS salty, I'm thinking they are reheating the Carne asada in the fryer. The food is thrown together and not appealing to the eye or stomach. The staff doesn't seem to care either. I will never go there again."}
{"text":"I've been to a lot of Filiberto's but this probably has to be the best one I've been to by far!!!! First of all the food was  good, service was great and the Restaurant was CLEAN!!!  Staff were really nice. I would definitely be coming back again!!"}
{"text":"I have eaten here a number of times when it's late and don't feel like cooking it's okay not the best but does the job to fill you up. We'll tonight I ordered the 2 cheese enchiladas after I got home and stated eating it I found 2 YES 2 black hairs in my food. I was so grossed out i started gaging. I called them and the lady said \"No we don't put hair in food you lying to get free food.\" Then just hung up. Will NEVER eat here again I will go the extra mile and go to  Federico's on 43rd and Peoria. There cleaner inside and out."}
{"text":"Great location, clean and wonderful customer service. As a Buckeye resident, it's difficult to find a restaurant that is near by and worth leaving the house for (very causal attire). Filiberto's Sports Grill is awesome! They have great food and a cool environment. Their wings and fries are delicious! The only reason I am giving them four stars is because we have to wait at least 10-15 minutes for the bill every time."}
{"text":"Quick and delicious, this location does not disappoint. Inside seating area is clean, and the salsa is plentiful. So yum."}
{"text":"This is without a doubt the worst carne asada burrito I've ever had at Filiberto's any of the many 'berto's I've been to, and as others have mentioned, it appears to be half filled. They put far too much sauce inside mine (don't know if that's par for the course).  The meat has an almost steamed flavor to it. I really can't explain it but, it's not desirable at all. It's definitely worth traveling over to the Cave Creek & Cactus Rd location. The only thing I can say negative about that location so far is they don't have limes. I can only hope that this location get bought out by someone willing to step up this locations game; because that's the only way I'd consider returning."}
{"text":"I came here last night for a late night craving and go Carne Asada fries. They were rhe best ones I've ever had. Everything was fresh and got. Usually when I get then there ia way too many fries and not enough toppings. It has the perfect ratio of everything on them. The staff was very very nice too. Good job guys!"}
{"text":"This location is good! I have a couple favorite items I like to get here when I'm in the mood. today was just a horchata. bottoms up!"}
{"text":"I love Mexican food, and love food when you need it after a long night, however I'm not so into this place. I hear mixed things some people love it, so you may too but I thought it was a tad bland and very very salty."}
{"text":"Bad customer service. I ordered a bacon breakfast burrito, I sat down and saw that no one was cooking at the stove behind the desk so thought maybe the rest of the kitchen is in the back..wrong!.. I waited about 10 min and there was one person in front of me waiting and then 2 more customers came in after me. After the 4th person the lady at the register dicided to call the cook up to start cooking!! So I decides to just forget it and went up to her and said that if hes just starting that I need to leave and ill just do a return and she insisted that it would be quick and told the cook to make mine first... worst breakfast burrito ive had from filibertos.l!! The burrito was so skinny( no worth the $6 i paid)the potatoes in the burrito weren't fully cooked. I Dont recommend this location. Register girl couldve gave warning of time I would have to wait if It was going to be more then 10-15 min and she definitely couldve been a little happier.
My visit was on sunday around 9am."}
{"text":"So my daughter  wanted to grab a quick snack, we stopped at filibertos,  the girl at the drive thru had some words written on the sleeve of her filibertos work shirt, one of the words was NIGGA so me being me,  I asked her what was written in her shirt she said \" some words this guy wrote in my shirt and I can't get it off even after washing it a lot if times\" I said that word is nigga and is very offensive you would want get a different shirt to work in, she replied \" I know\" .
Welling you knew yo ass would not have worn that shit to work in the first place."}
{"text":"We have eaten at Filibertos before and have had no problem but this time the restaurant was empty no clientele and I was the worst service I've ever had and the food tasted like there was nothing to it and actually it wasn't even that hot we did take it home for dinner which I would never eat there again I guess it depends on who's working as how the service and the food is made"}
{"text":"Whitest filibertos you'll ever see.  They got toothpicks and mints at the front counter and bags for their lemons at the salsa bar.  Three flat screens on one wall along with a Juke box.  Also for your convince there is a coca cola machine along with a monster machine as well.  They play Kelly Clarkson to music that sounds like it'd be in an early 2000's Hillary Duff movie. Overall a chill place."}
{"text":"Is it quality food? No.  Is it terrible? No.  Are there any other restaurants open 24 hours around?  No.  Is it better than your run of the mill Filiberto's?  Yes.  So there you go, if you're hungry, have no intent to fix your self something up, and it's late, head to Filiberto's."}
{"text":"They should fire the cook it was awful I will not be going to this location again. The burrito was cold the tortilla was stale and there was french fries inside of it WTF. Very disappointed!!!!! I would give zero stars if it would let me."}
{"text":"I come here probably 3 times a week and I always order a number 13. It's not only consistent, but it's also delicious. The interior is super new. Sometimes there's a bit of a wait but it's always worth it! Service is not noticeable, which is good when it's not s place with a wait staff XD"}
{"text":"Went there this morning to get breakfast because normally other filibertos locations have possible or menudo. When I pulled into the establishment the drive was was blocked by a bunch of cars that apparently belonged to the workers, I assumed it, because the place was empty. As I begin to order my food a rude woman was asking what we wanted. I asked if they had possible which to my surprise they didn't. I ten began to order menudo off the menu and I was rudely interrupted and told that they do not serve any types of \"soup\" there. I asked about other menu options and they also did not have them.. What is the point of having items on the menu if you do not carry them? I would at least put a piece of paper to cover up the items that they do not have instead of just letting your customer think you have them... So I left instead of wasting money at this place..."}
{"text":"I love this place!! I come here for breakfast a couple times a week and always get their rolled tacos. The staff is friendly and always make the food pretty fast. One thing that I would probably recommend is that they get a new speaker for the drive thru but other than that everything is great."}
{"text":"Came here last week while making it back to LA. Had a bacon breakfast burrito with loads of bacon, potatoes, cheese, and eggs. Topped off the burrito with their red salsa. The burrito itself was good but wasn't amazing. I felt like the burrito was something I could have made at home. It was a little greasy but I liked that they didn't skim out on the bacon and their salsa was pretty decent. May come back the next time I'm in AZ."}
{"text":"You can never go wrong with this place! It's tasty and different from most other Mexican joints. I always get a craving for it late at night which is perfect because they never close. I have always liked their taquitos. It's a bit divey but I've never gotten sick from here, so I have no complaints. There's sticker machines and such for kids to use as well. The menu is huge, and you'll find yourself looking over it for a long Time. I love it here!"}
{"text":"It's the best fast food place!! The food is great. The quality of the product they use seem to be good. 
The place is clean. The staff is very nice. What more could you want?"}
{"text":"Good food! Carnitas is delicious...
The daily 99 cent specials are the bomb!
My wife loves their beans & bean burros. I go here often."}
{"text":"This is my favorite filibertos location. The tortillas are always fresh, the employees are so friendly, and the food never disappoints! 
My favorite item on the menu is the veggie burrito! Make sure you try the green sauce too!"}
{"text":"If Yelp had a \"summon health inspection\" button,  I'd click it."}
{"text":"Yay Filiberto's!!!   

Of all the Filibertos in the whole wide world,  I like Salazar Bros the best.   This place is not Salazar Bros. 

This Filibertos is actually a real Filibertos,  and it's not as good.   But it's still a Filibertos,  so that makes it pretty awesome.   Yeah!"}
{"text":"While I appreciate the 24/7 and homey feel of Filiberto's (rather than the quick-flip fast food experience of a place like TacoB***), there was a taste and quality component that was lacking when I went. I ordered simply because often that's the test: can a restaurant do something simple, well? If so, you gotta winner. 
I had simple chicken and beef tacos and asked for salsa separately so I could assess all the flavors and figure my favorite combo. Both of the taco shells were burnt-crisps that we're hard to bite into and mouthfully tackle. Both the chicken and beef were somewhat bland, and the salsas were runny in consistency. I was really disappointed and figure I could've made better at home: an immediate and financial regret. 
Unfortunately, I was so underwhelmed, I've no incentive to go back..."}
{"text":"Very friendly staff. Great food as always. Can't beat the price. If you decide to dine in, the inside is very clean and up to date. Great place to stop by!"}
{"text":"The enchiladas were ok, portions were good, it looked good, but not much was there taste wise. Honesty my favorite thing about the place was the cute girl that worked in the front today."}
{"text":"I had the Carne Asada Fries, and it was good. It was loaded with a generous amount of steak, and then topped with sour cream, and cheese. I'm not a fan of guacamole, so I didn't get that, but I felt it was missing something crunchy, spice or cold, like pico de gallo and jalapenos. 

The woman at the front counter was super nice, but I literally had to wait while the cook stood there and fiddled with his phone. I was on lunch, and had to go, and this little wait made me somewhat angry. It wasn't a small wait either, it was long enough to where I was starting to think maybe they were switching it up and someone was making my food in the back, but nope, after he finally got done with his phone, he proceeded to drop my fries. Needless to say, I wasn't a happy camper about that at all.

However, the food was generous and more than fair for what you get, so I didn't complain. I'll be back."}
{"text":"Some days Filiberto's is on and some days they are off. Today, this Filiberto's was definitely ON and POPPIN'!

I had the grilled chicken soft taco, the meat was tender, well seasoned and plentiful, the service was fast, and the price is always affordable. 

This was an excellent experience, I'll be back!"}
{"text":"First place I go when I visit Mesa! Chips and guacamole are fantastic and it just such a relaxed casual atmosphere. I always get the same thing, but I try everything my brother and sister order and it's just good old Mexican comfort food. They sell Coke products! :) I just love this little place. And I live in San Antonio where there is fabulous Mexican food. :)"}
{"text":"Okay , what am I doing at a Filiberto's? That was the question of the evening, but it was Thanksgiving Eve and I had food to make , kids to quickly feed and my home from college daughter had a friend to meet nearby. So Filibertos it is. I ordered my traditional Mexican fast food  meal a  red  bean burrito.  Whoopee ..no big deal ..nothing to taste, blandness with  a wad of shredded cheese at the bottom...didn't get sick even though I have heard stories.   Place was clean and seemed  okay  . Girls thought theirs were just okay.  No harm no foul.  But I am not going back."}
{"text":"I recently ventured into Filiberto's for the first time a few months ago. My wife was buying breakfast for her office (going green and car pooling), apparently her office staff loves this stuff. So I said I might as well try a burrito myself. My only problem was that I heard these burritos were only good if you're shitfaced or pretty close to it. 

I ordered the sausage burrito. I opened it up and saw all the gooey greasiness of it and ate most of the sausage and egg in the burrito, but not the tortilla. It was okay to stem my hunger pangs but definitely not my go to breakfast spot. My only regret was that I wasn't there at two O'Clock in the morning listening to the stumbling drunken orders at the drive up."}
{"text":"Service is just so slow, especially in the drive thru.  A couple of bean burritos for the kiddos is going on 30 minutes...no one in front of us.  This is maybe my fifth time thru this location and it just keeps getting worse."}
{"text":"After a late night out on Halloween Eve, hubby and I were craving some tasty, cheesy Mexican goodness, and we luckily found this new Filiberto's. 

My standby is the shredded chicken burrito, and it was actually a bit dry at this location (usually it's very \"saucy\" and delicious). But thank goodness for their hot sauce. It's not like the typical fast food Mexican restaurant hot sauces - it's actually got FLAVOR. I go through like 4-5 of the little cups of it. That will make even the driest burrito \"saucy\" and it certainly did the trick that night. Yum. 

I'll be back I'm sure."}
{"text":"The longest wait ever. Not a place to go on lunch break or a quick break. Slow like it's normal."}
{"text":"Service is fine but the food is soooo good. Prices are reasonable for the large amount of tasteful food you get. Would recommend!"}
{"text":"There really aren't too many options for authentic Mexican food in Buckeye. Filley B's does a decent job but prices keep climbing and sometimes the portions are on the smaller side. I also had an issue with excessive grease on my pollo asado burrito. They sometimes overdo it to get a nice texture on the tortilla. I do however like their various salsas and service is on point"}
{"text":"Robbery! $8+ for a bean cheese sour cream with Jamaica! Burritos are significantly smaller. Still hungry!!"}
{"text":"I've gone to this specific location multiple times as I leave near by. I saw the prior two comments on this place and realized I had to post a positive review of this delicious filbertos! This filbertos has delicious food! No it's not restaurant quality tacos or tostadas...but for a fast food Mexican food spot...it's bomb, amazing Cali Burritos and fish tacos!  Green chile burritos are hit or miss!"}
{"text":"Every Filibertos I've been to has always been pretty consistent and this one is no different. The food is always great and in a timely matter given there's only two guys working at a time. Can't go wrong with this place."}
{"text":"We ordered three carnisada fries and when we got them they felt heavy enough so didn't bother to check when we got home we were so excited to see all three toppings they put on them. Then we started to mix it all up, unlike most they put s lot off fries and very little toppings, this place had very few fries and then threw a bunch of typing on top of the small (very small)handful of fries. Usually when U get to the Kat but it's nothing but fries this plate was nothing but steak filled with everything. Very disappointed, it would of been great if they put  enough fruits in it. I would of been a daily stopper there."}
{"text":"Had a pair of racist nasty workers call the police claiming we had weapons while we had or three years old daughter in our minivan. We spoke with a worker about nasty food that was govern to us and were told to bring it back to be fixed or a refund we explained we live a city away so asked if we could go the next day and he said yes. Well when we went the proteome were ride we showed the call log, the food, the receipt and yet they refused to refund us. Never mind all the gas money we wasted trying to fox their lacy mistakes but then they call the cops street continues looking into my minivan at my daughter and gonna say they think we have weapons. Pretty much was hoping that it was going to be just another black man and his family shot up by cps, not questions asked. Bet they wouldn't eat the food they gave to us. Not only was there litterly grease in my tray but the fries were litterly stuck together. Then my boyfriend's chimi was meatless. It's ok tho, because I'm going to post pictures up everywhere of their nasty food and their nasty behavior."}
{"text":"Let me start off with we were the only guests at the time and the lady couldn't get my order right for 2 people. Cashier was too busy talking with another employee about unrelated job stuff. This place use to be the spot to go to for Mexican food, but they have refried beans from a can and the salsa is too watery. The extra guacamole we ordered was watery as well. It's as if they are adding water to the product to expand the amount, I would know and I'm a Chef. I've got to give this place a thumbs down and will be taking my business to Federicos down the street."}
{"text":"I go here a lot and of course not every single time is a home run but 5 stars for how consistent they are. EXCEPT on Sunday but that get's a pass in my book. 

There was one time where I had to drive back because the guac and pico made my burro very cold and I expected the Shitty to come back my way but they were cool as hell!!! they apologized and explained what the issue was and hooked it up fresh.

Because this is a filibertos and only considering filibertos compared to other fast food mexican or other filibertos I've been too, 5 stars."}
{"text":"Okay place. Second day in a row buying two breakfast burritos and potatoes were undercooked EVERY time. ?"}
{"text":"First the positives about the place, its close to offices and the light rail stop. The restaurant and patio were clean. The staff was helpful in explaining the item on the menu. The menu had lots of choices to pick from, burritos, tacos, salads, individual items and even a daily special. The negatives, the food was just ok and the price was about $10 a person w drink for the combo i got. I wasn't impressed w the salsa and chip bar, the salsa wasn't much more like tabasco sauce. Not really my type of fast food mexican food but if your looking for something that is 1 step up from Taco Bell this might be up your alley. The wait to get your meal is pretty crazy, i'd say we waiting about 10 minutes for fast food mexican food that is just ok i'll pass next time"}
{"text":"The taco salad was soggy and barely edible. I wont go back. Go to Del Taco instead."}
{"text":"They're always are fast and nice. Best location I've been too. Fresh plates and good service"}
{"text":"This is the most ridiculous place ever. It's supposed to be 24 hours. At night they all get high and leave everybody in the Drive-Thru where they run in and out of the store and start laughing as you drive away all pissed off. I will never go here again and I will never recommend anyone to this location again and I don't recommend anyone else going either."}
{"text":"3 Stars is A-OK in Yelps definition, but I'm feeling this should move closer to Yelp's 4 stars = \"Yay! I'm a fan\".  

Tasty Mexican fast food at reasonable prices is what I've experienced.  Friday was $1 off Fish items and I had the Fish burrito.  Crispy fish, well portioned wrapped in a flavorful tortilla filled with cabbage and pico de gallo.  Add a soda and total was $5.33. 

Service was fast, green salsa at the Salsa bar had just the right amount of heat and flavor (I really like Salsa Verde).  
I'd say they are doing it right."}
{"text":"Clean and bright, excellent salsa, young, polite, + happy girls working there.  Far better than the Filibertos on Main near power.  Great Asada Burrito and no hassle on drink refills."}
{"text":"Should have believed the old but correct Yelp reviews.  

Yes this is a Filibertos but it is literally inside the gas station market.  They had specials listed on the board by the cash register and I pointed to the Green Chili Burrito special.  I paid and stepped aside then saw the drink included in the ad and inquired.  The cashier said I needed to order the special to get the drink and the burrito in that special is much smaller.   I asked to change to the special and he responded that it was different and not possible, probably since the order was already being worked.  
Oh well...

For my $4.80 it was finely chopped meat, green sauce and flour tortilla"}
{"text":"Three of us went there for dinner. Nothing special, kind of fast food Mexican style. Later one had a very bad upset stomach, the other two (including me) did not feel real good either.  No more Filbertos, no more"}
{"text":"We usually stop here on our way to Cali! All three of us always order breakfast burritos and a order of taquitos. Wife get a country breakfast burrito with beans and pico. I always get a steak and egg burrito, wish the quality of the steak is better and less greasy. Daughter also gets a country burrito. Now of course that's a lot of food already, but we always add a order of taquitos no matter how early it is. This will continue to be our breakfast stop when we travel out west."}
{"text":"I am actually a Filiberto's fan, however this location just doesn't do it for me. Every time I have ordered from here. There food just doesn't have much flavor. I always drive by them on my way to work, like the idea that they are opened 24 hrs. But there are too many choices to choose from (three by the time I hit the 101 fwy) to settle on their food."}
{"text":"Filiberto's is a local fast food franchise. It's a hit and miss establishment. I had the steak and egg burrito. They are huge, so I ended up eating half and saving the rest for lunch. The burrito had plenty of meat, and cheese. I added the green sauce and it was great. Not much more can be added. Most of their locations are pretty much the same. Service was fine!"}
{"text":"I usually come here on Wednesday morning. This is when I am at work by 5:00 am. Holds me over until a reasonable lunch time. Actually sometimes it holds me over until dinner. I always order a chili verde and egg burrito. Not on their menu, always willing to make it for me. Love this breakfast burrito, use to visit my grandmother here in Phoenix when I was a child and she would make this for me all the time. Now this burrito is huge, and very filling. Plenty of pork in the chili. I might not get there every week, but it will be a lot."}
{"text":"Good, cheap Mexican food. Usually go for fish tacos or a quesadilla. Portions are pretty big, so I can split 2 orders among 3 people and still get full, but the quality is just average. Also, I always end up waiting a long time for them to prepare my takeout orders. (I thought it was fast food?)"}
{"text":"We love this place. We had the steak Fajitas, and the Dragon salmon, both are around $11 which is a fair price to say the least. 

The bar area is visually pleasing with nice masonry veneer and a good looking bottle display.

Staff beer pouring skills could used a little work, as they have a nasty little habit of putting the spout into the glass, which is disgusting. 

We'll definitely be back for lunch, as the food quality is pretty decent."}
{"text":"Wanna know how to ALWAYS get something good from this 'Bertos?

Order this:

Steak Egg and Cheese Burrito

That puppy will NEVER let you down.  Moist, tender, flavorful carne asada with fried egg (yolks cooked all the way - not runny) and artery-choking cheddar cheese.

It is a huge amount of food, and be sure to ask for 3 containers of red salsa if you are taking it \"To Go\" as you will need that many to have salsa with every bite.

The flavors meld together VERY WELL and this will hit both your salt craving and your protein sweet spot.  It's my favorite \"fast food\" burrito in town - and I've had a LOT of them over the last 15+ years of living in The PHX.

Guaranteed you will like this one, if you eat carne asada and eggs in any other setting."}
{"text":"This is the place we go every Wednesday night for wings we get the neighbors together and have a social evening out their wings are great and their other menu items are just as good sometimes I opted for the salmon and shrimp cocktails are also awesome Services good go and have a good time"}
{"text":"I was afraid of Filiberto's for a lot of years.  They had only a handful of free-standing (that I knew about) 24-hour walk-up type places, and the stories I heard of people coming out of there indicated a gastrointestinal revenge of some type.  No bueno!

However -- since they've opened up the Pavilions store, my heart has opened up to Filibertos!  Their portions are HUGE, their food doesn't taste plasticized or like it was just previously in a freeze-dried state.  I love their bean burritos with sour cream added.  Dreamy!

The staff are a little tough to navigate.  They sound very irritated a lot of the time, and I'm not sure if they're a little sick of inhaling the fumes of nearby McDonald's or what.  Inconsequential.  Mmm Filibertos!"}
{"text":"The food here and at every other Filibertos literally has no flavor whatsoever. Not even their side sauces can save their food. It's just awful.have you ever seen guacamole that looks like baby food? Because that's what you get here."}
{"text":"Absolutely disgusting. Came here 15 mins out of my way for a breakfast burrito and a breakfast plate for my boyfriend and I. Get home and his burrito isn't in the bag. I call up and ask what happened and the girl straight up says' oh yeah I forgot to put it in the bag...etc what do you want to do about it?' 
I knew coming here was a mistake in the first place and I don't know why I agreed to it. The first time I ordered from this place a year ago, I ordered a carnitas burrito. I got a burrito with half shrimp and half chicken and it was not only the wrong thing, but foul. I swore to never order from here again, and today reminded me why.

Disgusting, flavorless, unidentifiable food and on top of that, horrendous, rude service.  Do NOT waste your money on this garbage."}
{"text":"I never noticed anything that creeps, crawls, flies or slithers let alone anything that i would consider unsanitary while ordering or eating from this location. My favorite is the 5 tacos of carnitas,asada ,lengua adobada,or pastor and a drink  for under 5 bucks. No joke.there isn't anywhere that serves food this good for this price."}
{"text":"This place was a 3-4 stars until today. I went in for a late lunch with my mother and daughter. Ordered carne asada fries, 2 orders of ceviche tostadas and the  99 scent special of the day which was a junior quesadilla. We ordered it to go. When we checked the food after we got home, we were missing the quesadilla and one order of the ceviche. We were starving and ate and I called an hour and a half later to see if I could come by and pick up the rest of my order. The lady answering the phone, didn't understand what my complaint was. She hung up on me. I called back twice and she did not pick up. She answered the third time and said to come by. I told her my boyfriend would with receipt because I had to go to work. She said okay. My boyfriend got there and he was told that the only item missing was the 99 scent quesadilla and that they would not be replacing the ceviche which was 3.99.  They did not believe us!! Too bad because their food is decent and they just lost a family of customers. So disappointed!! Terrible customer service!!"}
{"text":"I am a fan of filibertos...but not this location!!! I got a breakfast burrito this morning, I'm preggo but pregnant or not this was disgusting and would make anyone throw up! Consistently throughout the burrito was egg shell. Big and little pieces all thru it making it inedible. It's not that hard to crack an egg. This will be my last time at this location"}
{"text":"The guy at the counter looked uninterested in what we ordered, it also reflected in our order as it was completely wrong, not sure if I will choose this establishment again, because paying 35 dollars for the wrong food is not the way to do business"}
{"text":"nasty late night food.. ewww I was in Arizona on Thanksgiving weekend stopped in after the casino and wow so nasty! The drive thru was supppppperrr slow I had a van with 8 other people the food took about half an hour! ohh you know when ur really craving something and it isnt fullfilled!?? Dont get the horchatta! sooo watered down it was disgusting and no one was impressed by any of the items we ordered. Half the order was done incorrectly anyway. But, the positive part the lady giving us our food took back my horchatta very rudly and gave a soda instead. Then she literally threw my old horchatta across the resturant into a trash can..i guess thats were it belonged oh well never doing that again!"}
{"text":"Good qucik cheap mexican food."}
{"text":"DO NOT LEAVE DRIVE THRU W/O checking your order first if you have to hold up the entire line so be it. 

They get your order wrong and when you call them to ask for the food they charged you for but never gave you they want you to take all the food back and waste your time and gas to go back and prove to them the messed up. Yet they have a Tip bucket hanging outside the drive thru window.  ******Here's a Tip get orders right*****

who has a Tip bucket at a drive thru window that's sooo Tacky!!

remove  your tip bucket from drive thru window your a fast food drive thru with a bunch of Clowns  that don't get a $12.00 dollar order right."}
{"text":"I stopped here this morning seeing the sign in the window advertising a breakfast burrito for 3.99.  I thought I would give it a try so I ordered it along with a small coffee ....Oops, no coffee at Filibertos so ordered a small coke ....the coke, a cup of ice and a little coke was 2.49!!!!! Really ... oh well ...ask for some hot sauce .... the burrito was BIG, bland and big with just the flavor of onions....there was ham cubes but it was not browned and totally tasteless .... the hot sauce was like watery tomato juice.  I was disgusted, felt ripped off, and will never stop at any of their stores again.  What a joke for supposedly real Mexican food.  Even McDonald's burritos are a more flavorfull option!!!!"}
{"text":"Good beef taco, but the cheese enchiladas were uncooked garbage. It was very warm inside like the AC was not working or set way to high.

Salsa bar (or whatever it is called) was in need of cleaning."}
{"text":"FIRST OF ALL, ARE YOU FRIGGIN KIDDING ME. I was so excited to get tacos. 1) my order was way over priced 2) I got an entirely wrong order 3) I thought what I was given was rolled tacos but It was literally SOGGY DROOPY tacos. I am disgusted and offended, how dare you think it's okay to serve this disgusting food to me."}
{"text":"Alright... this is my first time in my life writing a review online about ANYTHING. But I was very upset and thought I should write a comment about this ridiculous place.
 I just came back home from filibertos on apache in tempe and I honestly think that they need a better service everytime I go there.

Today, I had my dog in my car and OBVIOUSLY my dog started barking just a little bit when he saw the person who worked there. That's what dogs do, DUH. But the rude thing was that the employer told my dog  to \"SHUT UP\" several times in a row.

I mean.. are you being serious here? you don't tell customer or the dog to shut up. I even said sorry, but he kept on saying shut up and he literally meant it.
For the dog lovers out there, I'm sure you understand my situation.

But this isn't the only thing.
I ordered super nachos and I absolutely love sour cream and always ask another side of it. But when I got home, it didn't have sour cream (like before), so I called them to ask what had happened. The guy picked up and told me \"oh, no sour cream.\" and acted like he didn't know english. Ok... then what was the english that you spoke before?

I don't care how well or not well you don't speak english. But isn't it a common sense to let the customer that they are out of sour cream? and isn't there suppose to be a SORRY that comes along with it? And also, instead of shut up, there are other words like, quiet down, calm down, please be quiet, and whatever the other possibilities are. And if you don't know english, then at least SMILE!

At first I thought these issues depended on the employers who worked there so I tried it couple more times. But NO. They are all the same. I am very offended, hurt, and disrespected. WHAT A WASTE OF MONEY?! And of course this isn't the first time, since I have been here several times and their services were always rude. This is my last straw, and I am never going back again. Have a good life filibertos. I hope you close down and go out of service."}
{"text":"The problem I have is not with the food but, with the customer service at this location. Every time we stop by the employees are very rude and act like they don't want to be bothered. On one occasion the lady working the drive thru never said a word to us then has the nerve to say \"I'm waiting on you.\" A hello or an may I take your order would be great!"}
{"text":"I've been a long time fan of the filibertos franchise, and have visited many locations across the valley. This particular location is one of my favorites. The staff is friendly, the orders are accurate, and the food quality is great compared to many other locations. No skimpy burritos or guacamole that looks like green water at this Fili-B's!"}
{"text":"Good food burrito was huge! fast service and took advantage of the free rolled tacos for checking in."}
{"text":"come about 2 times a month for a good fast dinner ! staff is very nice and always gets my order right every time ! I always get 5 rolled tacos with cheese and guacamole and a cheese quesadilla ! my boyfriend always gets something different but his favorite is there carne asada burritos ! this place is a must for fast good Mexican food ! I will always come here ! love it !!!!!"}
{"text":"I love this fast and delicious Mexican food place.  It's so tasty and flavorful and authentic.  It doesn't taste like Tex-Mex at all.  Seems very authentic and delicious."}
{"text":"Why do I continue to punish my self MAN !!! I These guys stay in business because of dummies like me. I thought they might have changed. Ordered in drive through, I got a #9 and she rushed me saying \" Is that all \" I said no i Want a large Pina She then rushed me again and no I asked for 3 green salsa. Can you believe it she missed all that I had to explain a second time at the window . She gives me the food and shoozz me off. HELLLOOOO !!! I just told you I wanted a Pina !! She charges me for the drink the whole bill was $14 What did I order? I get down the road and booooom My ORDER IS FREAKIN WRONG AAAHHHH !!!! 
  PLEASE BOYCOTT ALL FILBERTOS They are all the same.. What a shame  What the Heck is up with the meat ? Is It boiled Disgusting"}
{"text":"Sweet today is my cheat day to eat some meat !! Super glad I stopped in!! Got a California burrito, as the cook explains what's inside he went to a small sink close by and washed his hands as we talked. Wow super clean. He cooked everything to order fresh. He dropped new fry's and cooked asada that wasn't left over from grandpas hang over remedy bowl. Best burrito iv had by far. The salsa bar is killer. I'm all about the sauce .....  The staff is very friendly a specially the cook , his a good fella"}
{"text":"Yuck. We just stopped here and it's terrible!!! I went several months ago and it was ehhh, ok but decided to give it a second chance and I am so disappointed. I ordered a #19 and it's completely inedible. The enchilada was so smashed I couldn't tell what it was and had a terrible sour after taste. Please avoid this place. Luckily I have a strong stomach but I wouldn't be surprised if someone gets food poisoning soon because the after taste is not natural."}
{"text":"Good. Big portions. Banging, flavorful burritos...

It's the 1 and only thing I don't hate about Arizona."}
{"text":"This place is awful.  They mess up my order and then over charge  me.. wouldn't refund me my money.. The drive thur sucks.. never again at this location.."}
{"text":"Filib's what can I say. If you are craving your basic Mexican taco shop this is the place! I am just excited that one has opened closer to home!

Personally I love their burritos, nachos and quesadillas. Filib's is my go to place when I am hungry and need a quick meal.

BTW I still do not agree with Yelp, burritos are a food group, DARN IT!"}
{"text":"So here's latest.  I received a message from the BBB this evening stating that they were unsuccessful at getting a response from Filibertos.  Not sure what the next step is, but I am not finished."}
{"text":"Came here to order tacos and I got to admit their customer services was very rude. When I change my order I don't expect you to tell me I'm wrong that you told me already how it is. You just accept it and make the customer happy."}
{"text":"Haven't eaten at Filiberto's in quite awhile but when they opened in Laveen decided to give it another try. It has been a couple of years since I had eaten there.  This new location in Southern is clean and the employees are friendly. Food was much better than the food I had been served before. It was hot, fresh, and tasted great.  I will definitely be going back!"}
{"text":"Love the food. Service in the drive-thru is slow but I haven't had food poisoning after eating here so that is a plus."}
{"text":"I've been to this location a few times. There was one guy in front of us at the drive thru. He was sitting there for 10 minutes at the intercom (no joke)! He started honking his horn. Guess he was waiting for the intercom employee to take his order..... Ridiculous! I really think one lady was doing the cooking, the register, and the intercom!"}
{"text":"It's a fast food atmosphere, but the food is really good.  The breakfast burritos are too big for one person and a great deal.  Everything tastes great, too."}
{"text":"Man...WHENEVER I'm passing through Phoenix...this place is hands down my favorite spot to hit up...foods always on point...people are always courteous there...absolutely luv it!!!"}
{"text":"Tried this place for the first time since it was close. This place is disgusting. There was no taste to any of the food or sauce. The chicken rolled tacos, guacamole, rice, and beans, had absolutely no taste everything tasted the same and was very greasy and they were very expensive. I couldn't even eat it, it was so bad. What a waste of $10."}
{"text":"Not Very Good

The staff at Kingbertos Mexican Food are warm, friendly, and extremely accommodating, which is why I feel terrible for calling out their Mexican food as bland. I really wanted to like Kingbertos  so badly, especially after reading so many positive reviews. However, the food in my opinion just isn't good.

This was my first visit to Kingbertos Mexican Food Restaurant, and for me the food  just isn't good. On this visit  I choose the shredded beef taco, tostada, Refried Beans, and Mexican Rice, both of which had very little taste.  In fact the refried bean almost had a somewhat grey appearance, and the shredded beef was very greasy.  The meal was just very disappointing.

Kingbertos isn't the worst but I'm not in a rush to visit again"}
{"text":"This location is a brand new one, opened a few months ago, right acrossed the street from where I work...so, I decided to walk over on my lunchbreak yesterday and try one of their lunch specials and I'm glad I did! They have a Five for $5 lunch special and I gave their Junior Chimichanga a try. It's a smaller version of their Chimichanga plate and just as tasty too. It comes with beans and rice, guacamole, and sour cream...very, very good! 

They have a nice open restaurant with many seats and tables and also seats and tables outside for beautiful spring and fall days when the weather isn't hot. 

There is a chip and salsa bar for your eating pleasure as well, so I will have to remember to try that with my next meal from there at lunchtime. 

Their staff is very friendly and accomodating and provides fantastic service. The place gets packed at lunch too, so you know they're doing the right things here. 

This is a very popular place with the crew I work with, so that alone speaks volumes as far as I'm concerned!"}
{"text":"If you have never tried Filiberto's and are looking for good Mexican food, I recommend giving these guys a chance. They have many items to choose from on their menu and if you aren't sure of something, their staff will explain an item to you and tell you in very good descriptions what it is or entails. They have really good salsas, but be warned....their Tomatillo salsa (green sauce) is hot and has some kick to it! 

If you have a sweet tooth, I recommend their Flan and also their Tres Leches Cake. Both of these desserts are delicious and offer just the right amount of sweetness to satisfy even the finickiest of eaters. 

My favourite meal is their Enchilada plate and it's enough of a meal that I usually eat half for dinner and the rest for lunch the following day. It is just filling enough for me. If you want an appetizer-type of item, I recommend the Rolled Tacos with your choice of either sour cream or guacamole and in choices of 3 or 5.

If you like Horchata, then you are most likely to love theirs. It is just perfect!"}
{"text":"If you are craving Mexican food at 3 in the morning, this place is for you.

Holy Taco Tuesday.  Who can say no to a delicious chicken or beef taco for a dollar?
Horchata is also a sugar-overdose of a wonderland.   

They also have the best breakfast burritos.  Hands down.  Eggs, bacon, extra cheese & pico.   They will put ANYTHING into your burrito.  Just ask.

I've heard a lot of things about the Super Nachos but I cannot find it in my heart to order them.

Make sure to extra red sauce all of the things."}
{"text":"Gave this location one star because I asked them to substitute shrimp instead of beef on their super nachos. As I do not eat beef and I've done this at other locations. Apparantly that was too difficult a task and had to spend 5 or so minutes picking the beef out of the nachos. Definitely disappointed with this location and will not be returning."}
{"text":"Sunday football... 8 tv's with the Cowboys game on. NOT ONE TV with the Cardinals on.... The home team. The person controlling the tv's said he could put it on a back TV and that they \"accommodate everyone, but most Cardinals fans stay at home to watch the games.\" Very irritating. But I'm always happy with the bartenders & most of the time by the food. Prices are slightly high, but it's the only sports bar on this side of town so they know they can get away with it."}
{"text":"A \"pint\" of rice is what I paid for. What I got was a 4 oz portion. Did measurements change. The employees are nice. But this specific location always takes about 20 mins longer than others. I have waited in this drive thru once for 40mins. I watched the clock. I do keep coming back because of its close proximity."}
{"text":"Fili-B's is one of my guilty pleasures when I visit AZ. I crave it every day of my life until the few days I get to go back for a visit and indulge myself. With that said, the consistency of the food from one location to the other is terrible. This is one of the less great locations that I've visited. My food was a bit dry and my order wasn't even remotely correct (which I didn't notice until I arrive back at my hotel).

As much as I love Filiberto's, I won't visit this location again and will travel a bit further to get the food, which when done right is an example of heaven on earth!"}
{"text":"Fili-B's is the closest thing you can get to real Mexican food in the Phoenix valley. It is dirty and slightly unnerving when you order the first time but in my opinion, it is well worth it. Some people violently disagree and aren't willing to chance getting the runs to eat here, but for me that is a chance I will willingly take. 

My order is essentially the same every time: a massive carne asada burrito with a large horchata. So, the moral of the story is that Filibertos isn't for everyone, but for those who aren't afraid of possibly eating cat, it is a winner. It is also very inexpensive so it is popular with the college crowd. Try it."}
{"text":"I repeated my order 3 times \"Arizona Burrito with EVERYTHING on it.... sour cream, guac, cheese, pico de gayo.\" But still happened to not have anything in it except for meat and potatoes. That is so frustrating when you have the late night craves; disappointing, for sure."}
{"text":"This place trash. Smell like ass. I oughta slap the person who had the audacity to slap \"Mexican Food\" at the end of that sign, goofy ahh. This place weak, they food game got me weak, gave me the ish for weeks. TRA TRA TRASH."}
{"text":"I waited 35 minutes IN THE DRIVE THRU. I will never be going to this location again. There was only one car in line before me. This is absolutely unacceptable."}
{"text":"Good food for a fast food joint.  The staff is usually very cool (I'll admit to having a bit of a crush on one of them), the prices aren't the cheapest out there but the quality is generally good, and the daily $1 deal usually rocks.  

Add to that the free salsa bar with assorted goodies....I've rarely been let down."}
{"text":"Very clean. Friendly staff. Other than that the food is just extremely greasy. I was so excited that they opened here. Unfortunately, I won't return."}
{"text":"Called in an order for pickup. We ordered super nachos and a machaca burrito. They allowed us to use the 3 free rolled tacos check-in promo even though we didn't dine in! The order total came out to about $15.50, a decent price for the huge portions! 

Food was hot and ready when we arrived to pick up. Place was clean, and staff was nice. 

Now as far as the quality of the food, it was good but a bit on the salty side. The green salsa was a little... Tart, I guess? The machaca was okay, but again really too salty to taste any of the other flavors! (For instance, Chino Bandido's or Carolina's machaca is loaded with flavor and spice!) :-( Maybe it was a fluke. I've tasted better Mexican food but for being so close to home and priced so well, we will probably come back."}
{"text":"I had an issue that I wanted to bring to the attention of management, so I went on the website and wrote out my issue, went to send it, and no matter how I wrote the date it said \"format invalid\" so I could never send my comment. 

In order to help other people who might go to this location (or any filiberto's I guess, you should know that there is this potential for mix up.

Here is what I experienced:

On the menu there is a heading of \"Breakfast Burritos\" and underneath the first 1 is called \"Breakfast\" followed by other types of burritos. When a person orders \"a bacon breakfast burrito\" they likely want 1 burrito from the \"Breakfast Burrito\" list...the \"Bacon\" one. Unfortunately, when there is also a burrito called \"Breakfast\", the employee thinks you're ordering two burritos...a breakfast one and a bacon one. The person doesn't realize until the order is complete and the total is double the listed price. But by then the employee is no longer on the line to correct the order. When the customer pulls up to the window and tries to explain, the employee can't understand why the person thinks they only ordered one burrito and he argues that they ordered a breakfast burrito and a bacon burrito. 

I imagine the breakfast burrito ends up in the trash or eaten by employees and the company loses money. I'd suggest a different name for the \"Breakfast\" Breakfast Burrito. Maybe \"Deluxe\" or \"Special\"? I dunno, but a breakfast burrito called \"Breakfast\" is like a taco filling called \"Taco\". What kind of taco do you want? Beef? Chicken? Taco? And how do you order these? I need a taco taco or a breakfast breakfast burrito? And how do I order the type without saying the heading? Like \"I want a machaca\"...uhhh...a machaca what? Can't say \"breakfast burrito\" because then you've just ordered a breakfast breakfast burrito! See how confusing this is? It makes no sense. Not my loss if you keep wasting food because of this issue, but I wanted someone to know."}
{"text":"Not all Filibertos in Phx were created equal.  This review is for the Filibertos on SW corner of Williams Field & Val Vista (near Kohls).

Beans here are always cooked right (not overcooked & burnt tasting or under cooked like I've had at other locations).  

This location is leaps and bounds better than the other locations around the valley."}
{"text":"On the rare occasion that I actually wanted eggs , I decided to go get some Huevos Rancheros .... very disappointed. They didn't have whole eggs , but instead , premade box egg yolks. They told me they scrambled the eggs but instead,  they made a egg pancake and folded it up . The eggs were over cooked and tasted burnt. I couldn't eat them . Instead , I ate the tortilla with the beans , rice , guacamole and sour cream"}
{"text":"Filly Bs. I LOVE this place. This location is particularly good. I love their taco tuedays, something about their chicken tacos is just good. I love their carne asada tacos, chicken tacos, and their bean burritos. If you want cheap, big portions of good Mexican food, Filly Bs is it. It's not by any means fine dining or a \"restaurant\", but it's a good quick stop place."}
{"text":"BEST BEAN BURRITO IN AZ!!  I religiously get their bean babies two or more times a week. I know beans are something that often get overlooked and are underrated, but these have a earthy flavor I have yet to find anywhere else including other filibertos. Just do yourself a favor and next Wednesday go get yourself a $2 bean and cheese burrito and then you'll get what I'm talking about. I feel that my life would have less joy if I wasn't aware of this tiny little gem. I'm not sure who to thank for those beans but whoever you are, you are my hero and I wish nothing but good things for you."}
{"text":"This is the worst filbertos I have ever gone to. I think my burrito was sour and its really dirty.  My guess is the guac was bad. Hope I dont get sick. I am mad at myself for eatting it. I should have just thrown it away."}
{"text":"So it's late and you are craving tacos and beans. You hit the drive thru, request double beans in place of rice and beans (because you love lard AND dislike Mexican rice). You pay, drive home, lay your purchase on the coffee table.  The table strains to hold all of the goodness contained in that styrofoam clamshell.  You open it up and ... find no beans and about three pounds of rice. Fail Filibertos, double rice fail."}
{"text":"There must be a new girl working there who is a complete idiot. I had to repeat my order to her multiple times then verify it at the window only to get home and see she still gave me the wrong thing. I couldn't eat it and there went $7 into the trash. The crappy part is this isn't even the first time I've come here and dealt with her screwing up my order. I'm livid and never returning here again. She's ruined it for me and I use to love them."}
{"text":"Friendliest 24 hr taco joint I've ever been to. The food always tastes fresh. I like chicken and carne asada tacos. The drive thru staff is quick and always gets my order right. I love the convenience."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I went to this Filiberto's yesterday, my food was alright at best though one of my carne asada tacos felt as though I was trying to chew through an old boot. Unfortunately my boyfried, who ordered a grilled chicken burrito, was unable to eat his burrito. No more than 2 bites in he came across a 1.5\" bone in his burrito. When we returned to inform them of this, the manager stared at us with a blank and uncaring expression even as we informed him that it could have been very dangerous if a small child had been served this burrito. We didn't even receive an apology, so we're definitely not going there again. I'd advise anyone with small children or if you just don't chew your food well not to come here, cause if you choke to death, they won't care."}
{"text":"I've been a long time customer of Filibertos but I think it's time to make the switch to Federico's. The last several times I've come here the drive thru ladies have rationed my hot sauce. I love hot sauce and I like a lot of it on my food. This last time we ordered 2 meals and she would only give us 4 tiny hot sauces. I like filibertos because it is convenient, not necessarily because it's that good. The hot sauce made it good and now that I can't get the hot sauce I want there's no point in stopping by."}
{"text":"It always seems to amaze me coming to this location! 
I love filibertos and this location is around the corner from where I live however it offers the slowest service ever! On average when I go through the drive thru it takes  anywhere from 10-20 minutes absolutely unacceptable. At times there is only 2 cars in front of me or less and the wait is horrible. I really do not recommend this location at all. I order bean and cheese burritos and I swear every time I get them they get smaller and smaller for a 5 year old child. The tortilla is crunchy or burnt half the time but I give the the opportunity to prove me wrong and some times they do a great job but most of the time they fail!"}
{"text":"Sadly, all good things must come to an end.  Much like my relationship with Los Betos, so goes mine with Filiberto.  Maybe his cousin will be better.

On my last visit, the chips were burnt. The guac tasted old.  The cheese in the enchilada had re-solidified to some disastrous inedible wad of nastiness.  Yes, I threw out cheese.  And the beans were just...there aren't words to express the horror.  Dry, stiff, terrible flavor.  Thankfully the taco was good, as was the rice.  It's a damn good thing I buy a lot of food!

For now, I say goodbye.  But I know in my heart, someday I'll be back, remembering the good times, hoping he will have changed...Until then, I leave an extra star for the memories."}
{"text":"Maybe if you grew up with this?  Not sure why there are 5 stars on this restaurant.  Seems like lowest common denominator food when I have had it.  I avoid it if I can and only go when others really want to.  Cheap food.  This location has always had good service.  Seems like a bad taco time to me."}
{"text":"Poor service. Front counter gal had a really bad attitude as if I was bugging her. I ordered the three mini tacos. When I received them they were extremely sloppy, looked like garbage food and had no cilantro. They said they didn't have any cilantro today. July 6th at 11:58 am and your out of cilantro???!!!!???  I'll stick with going some place else for lunch. And to think, I drove 12 miles to come to this one. Never again."}
{"text":"1/31/2017- about 2:20pm.Ordered 2 chicken street tacos and 2 carne asada tacos, requested no onions. When I got to the window, the cashier provided me total $6.47 I handed him the cash and he shut the window, not realizing I still had the $.47 he opened it and said $.47 is missing. I handed him the rest of the change I already had in hand that could have been given if he wasn't in a rush (only one car behind me) when he handed me my food at the window (It was drive thru service) I asked him \"No Onions, right\" He said \"No Onions\" of course before I drive off I check my order. It was two black to go boxes, top order had the chicken street tacos no onions perfect! On my way back to work, I open the bottom box and there are onions on my tacos. Not only was the rep rude but he lied to my face! Poor Service today. I called the store to complain or at least get a name of the rep who handed me my food and lied to my face, but there was no answer. Unable to file complaint online any date format you put is invalid"}
{"text":"I eat here every time I am in town and it is usually good. I had the Carne Asada burrito and it was dry, little to no marination and no guacamole. It was disappointing. I usually get the Patrone it is is really good. I hope they improve the Carne Asada because this was below average."}
{"text":"The nighttime manager at this E Main location ROCKS AND is to be commended for customer service.  Reason: bought a rotten tamal from the Filibertos on N Power, but did not notice 'til I almost had almost reached the next Filibertos on E Main.  Even though each of these locations are managed by different people the manager on E Main made things right by letting trade in the rotten one for a fresh one.

I really see no reason to try the Filibertos on S Power again.  I don't care how new of a restaurant you have you should never sell something rotten.

BOTTOM LINE: If you're in the E Valley area and going to Filibertos go to the one at 64th and E Main."}
{"text":"Tacos was so burned i couldn't even eat them (and you couldn't get lettuce in them) had to break them open to try to find some good meat to eat FIX IT ASAP.   I once loved your tacos... I'm not going up on you guys yet... I hope next week i can get some tacos that's edible."}
{"text":"I decided to try this joint out since it's just around the corner from my house today. I ordered a bacon breakfast burrito with red and green sauce as I like to mix them. My first few bites were egg and grease only. Grease dripped out of the bottom and top of my burrito. Gross. Why I continued to eat I'm not sure. I hit the bacon in another bite or 2. I'm not even sure it was bacon... I chewed and chewed and chewed. I ended up having to spit it out (Sorry if that was TMI). I opened the burrito to check out the rest of the 'bacon' only to find the worst quality of bacon fat and pools of grease. My appetite was gone. From now on I'll drive the extra few miles to Los Favoritos which is 150% better quality and better prices!"}
{"text":"Super nachos always hit the spot. Biggest burritos."}
{"text":"If I could give zero stars you bet I would. How can this place even consider their food to be authentic Mexican. Just a BIG NO if you ever want real authentic flavorful Mexican food save yourself and go Backyard Taco or Taquitos Jalisco."}
{"text":"They never disappoint me! I always get carne asada fries and they are always perfect. The employees are also very nice and look like they enjoy their jobs, they are enjoyable to interact with."}
{"text":"Born and raised Arizona and FiliB's has served me at my most PMS'd and drunkest. Depending on the location you can truly be screwed out of the fast food Mexican experience. This location was by far the tops; 32cnd street and Baseline. Chips, great salsa that isn't pepper juice and water and even a chunky salsa option. Cucumbers and roasted jalapenos to munch on. They provide signs everywhere stating the no pants, no shirt, no service policy as well as security camera postings. The service was fast and by far the best tasting of all the locations I've been too. I had the machaca burrito combo with enchilada and all the damned chips and salsa I wanted. The machaca was actually very well made- couple lemon squeezes on top and I was in taste bud heaven.  The enchiladas are kinda standard across the board-same sauce at every location and it isn't the best nor spicy by any means but fills that need for a cheesy, salty, corn tortilla craving. A clean location that has a continuous flow of patrons coming in is news of a good spot. I will definitely come back."}
{"text":"We were in Phoenix on a mini vacation and luckily we found this place.  I had a chile verde burrito which was excellent, filled with lots of meat no fat or gristle like the ones back home in El Paso.  My girlfriend had some chicken tacos which she loved also.  Wish we had something like this back home."}
{"text":"OK...so I am waiting for Yelp to get into the half a star system so things aren't so cut in dry, I gave this place a 3 but it probably is more like  a two and a half star joint..

OK so my first day in Phoenix this was the first place I had ever eaten, a friend of mine took me there and afterword asked me how I liked my grilled cat;) in any event then this place was a dump, and I might of thought that he was serious about the fried cat in my burritos, now since that time this place has come quite a ways but not quite that far. 

As far as the drive thru goes it is super fast, and going inside is not suggested, it is a bit dirty and even when it looks clean you still have the feeling like your in a scene from Joe's apartment and the roaches are hiding around every corner and under every napkin holder waiting to jump up and start water skiing across your salsa dish. The food ranges on decent, I always end up with the carne asada burrito or super nachos which is enough for two people to say the least. 

 But I have had some bad experiences their two, where the burritos feel like they were dipped in beef water not good...or the nachos are so greasy that they eat through the Styrofoam container they are served in. 

The staff is friendly for the most part, and this place is ALWAYS open! 

This is my late night nothing else is open except jack in the crack I am hungry but not that hungry place to eat.

 I would have to say stay away from any place that has the word berto's in it which I think is Mexican for fireass, but in general this location is good enough for me to yelp about it, I would say yelp it at your own risk, but for after hour drunk food it will suffice."}
{"text":"This is a staple after you got really trashed the previous evening. Quick, good eats with just enough grease to coat the prior nights rage.

Great for a quick dinner too. We chow on the rolled tacos and a fat Chicken Burrito. This place will save your butt before a big meeting. Many locations in the Valley of the Sun. #vino2ultimate #vinosquared"}
{"text":"Great, authentic Menudo freshly made Saturday and Sunday mornings. Flavorful, although a little on the hot side. We order to go, huge orders, great price. We usually call to check if it's ready and to ask that they prepare it ahead. Almost as good as my dad's!"}
{"text":"I ordered my food fairly late into the night thinking I'll get something better than my local jack in the box. when the male at the window is slurring while telling me a good portion of the menu can't be made ((I've ordered the same carne fries at this time MULTIPLE times)). I don't make a big hassle about it and continue on. I am then greeted at this after arriving T-8 minutes later ((liquid sour cream and a taco meal that didn't include 2/3 main ingredients? Rice and beans uhmmm)).. I've doubted most people who say they acquire food born illnesses through this restaurant but I'm beginning to feel sick myself. Extremely disappointed. Maybe hire someone who can identify spoiled items and communicate correctly."}
{"text":"I try to give this location a chance but always get sick from their food. Today was the worst, had stomach.cramps, upset stomach, dizziness, vomiting and diaherrea. They always make me sick yet other places don't. I warn you all I gotwas a egg bacon cheese burrito and I swear it was food poisoning. Only eatable thing is the rice. Love it but this place is verybad."}
{"text":"I got the sausage breakfast burrito and it was decent. The sausage wasn't very good but all the other ingredients were fresh. The next day I got severe food poisoning. I wont be back."}
{"text":"Since my kids went to ASU I have wanted to try this place meaning the restaurant because there are many locations.   I know your suppose to go at 3am not 3pm but I got there. Shared taquitos with guacamole and had my first Horchada.  I usually don't like these kinda drinks but I enjoyed it anyway.  I would go back at 3am or 3pm ."}
{"text":"As far as filli b's go this one is very clean and the staff have always been very friendly. That said if I find myself here I always get the cheese enchiladas for the sole reason that I've lost count of the number of times now that I've bitten into raw meat here."}
{"text":"So this was my first time at this location and I was a little annoyed with them. They have a great deal on Mondays where you get 3 rolled tacos around $1.29 plus tax. I decided to order those to go. So they call another customers order number, and she ordered the same thing as I, she tells them she didn't want cheese just lettuce on her tacos, so they put it to the side and dusted off the lettuce.

I must be psychic because I knew what they were going to pull, I watch them pack her dusted off tacos and tell me my order was ready! Yeah not happening, I tell them I don't want her food, I want what I ordered fresh. So long story short, they take another 5 mins to make me 3 tacos and I ended up walking and eating because my lunch break was nearing an end.

So will I go here again...probably so, the food was decent, although they use mystery meat that's tough as freak in the rolled tacos. I don't expect anything else from a Filibertos honestly...cheap food that's edible. Just make certain they don't try to pull a fast one on you.

*Update*
I will not be going here again, I just saw a review where a bandaid was in a burrito YUCK! Lol"}
{"text":"Visiting frm Los Angeles, I ordered a chicken burrito and I split that with my friend and we both agree that it was excellent, we also ordered 2 fish tacos and to my friends surprise they were very delicious. Quick drive thru service...
I want to let ppl know that the chicken was shredded and juicy to our liking.
My only bad comment is that I am a big fan of green salsa and I thought there's was watered down and not even tolerable."}
{"text":"Wow, why did I not take the 2 seconds and read the reviews. Ordered a horchata and a shredded beef taco. The drink was mediocre. The taco was a joke. It seriously had about a tablespoons worth of meat, maybe less. Now the place is very clean and the lady taking my order was very pleasant."}
{"text":"Food is great but lack of customer service is what cost them two stars.

First I was at the window unattended for ten minutes and started to think I was at the wrong window. The window was so tinted I couldn't see anything through there. 
Second, the guy asked \"you want any hot sauce?\" I replied \"yes, can I have green sauce please?\" This guy literally gave me nothing but red sauces! So that brings it down another star me having to go all the way back for a green sauce. 

Took me about 20 minutes just to find the place, it's not exactly out there for everyone to see."}
{"text":"I have eaten here several times. Tonight I found a long hair in the burrito I ate. I made sure and pulled on it and it was wrapped right in the burrito that I had already eaten 1/8 of. I can't ever go back now. It's so disgusting. I'm guessing the females there don't want to wear hair nets, but there's a reason people wear them. Yuck ! It makes me want to be sick thinking about it."}
{"text":"I don't know why I bypass Filiberto's when it comes to Mexican food. I've heard it's greasy, full of lard, whatever. I don't know, I don't eat at Filibertos. However, waiting for a contractor to meet me at the Depot, and I was hungry, and I love juevos rancheros, and well....I found myself at the counter of this Filiberto's. 

Service was very fast considering the place was packed with what seemed like a ton of other contractor types (lots of bright vests, tape measures, and workers gloves). My plate was overflowing with beans, rice, eggs, lettuce, etc. The eggs were cooked just right, and the little condiment bar just put things over the top. 

A great price for a filling breakfast."}
{"text":"My husband and I stopped by to have lunch one day at this location. Their salsa is very good I don't know if they have a specific name so excuse me if they do, but we loved their red salsa. We shared some of their carne asada fries they were really good. Just the fries at this location taste a little different from others we have had. 

The service was very fast and the girl that helped us was very friendly. I believe it might of taken me longer to get all the salsas that wanted to try than it did to get our food out. 

We will be visiting this location again."}
{"text":"Visited this Filiberto's sports grill twice, once during the first week of opening and the other probably a month after. 

The do own up to the sports grill name they have tv's on almost ever inch of their walls and have all sorts of sport memberbilia. The space inside is fairly small so during the weekend it can get pretty busy and packed, and might not be ok for kids. The reason I say this is because of the way some women are dressed during the later times of the night. 

They do offer some of the menu items that you can get at a Filiberto's, burritos, carne asada fries, and super nachos. As well as your typical bar food. 

Over all it's a good place to go grab a beer and hang out."}
{"text":"1st visit ever. Made to order breakfast burrito with loads of sausage and eggs. I liked the light green sauce at the salsa bar on it. Great burrito wrap. I will be back to try the tacos."}
{"text":"All that I wanted was a bacon, egg, cheese and potatoes burrito. I ordered two and placed it in the back seat. I got home and my back seat has grease all over it, I placed it on the hood to clean the car and they leaked all over the roof of my car. I wanted to save it so I wrapped it in a napkin to collect the grease. I had to use 3 napkins to gather the grease. As I ate one the tortilla was so greasy that the burrito was unmanageable. This would be my third bad experience at this location. 
On a precious occasion I walked in and waited 5 minutes. I was never greeted nor acknowledged the cook just kept cooking. I would say this place has an issue with customer service and quality. The food is not consistent as the size of the burritos differ from visit to visit. I can be clear in saying that the difference is size highly noticeable.  I've given them several chances and I will now say, this is the last strike."}
{"text":"Fast, friendly and their food is amazing! Thanks for such speedy service! Best one I've been to in the valley!"}
{"text":"I've eaten at most of the Filiberto's in Mesa, and this location is by FAR the worst in town. The food here is tremendously bad. I ordered green chili burritos, and they were so overloaded with salt we couldn't eat them. I gave them to the dog, and even the dog wouldn't eat them! Second visit, I ordered a carnitas platter. It came loaded with rice and beans, and almost NO meat. It was such a sad portion of meat, it made me laugh. There won't be a third visit. Thankfully, there's a Señor Taco just down the road at Power and McKellips that has far, FAR superior food. Do yourself a very large favor and give this location a pass."}
{"text":"Picked up from the drive-thru, ordered a carne Asada burrito, add beans, add cheese. All I received was a bean and cheese burrito, not one piece of meat, charged me for a carne asada burrito anyway. Will not come back to this location again."}
{"text":"Taco Tuesday ! 99 cent tacos. Not to bad tacos little dry though. Pretty decent prices though but customer service pretty rude tome every time"}
{"text":"Gross.  Typical greasy, low quality Mexican food.  If it's all you can afford Buon Appetite."}
{"text":"man this place was a quick stop in desperation for a quick meal on my way back to work.  chicken fajitas don't doit ... JUST BE hUNGRY and go on your way . i dont want to just strait bash everything because well I ate it .. But dam . i know realize i shouldn't have.. just saying ,, best of luck"}
{"text":"This place comes through when you're hungry late at night! Not the best Mexican food but it's what I could find locally while I was staying at my friends house. They've got a huge menu of all types of Mexican Foods! This one is located near a farm on one of Buckeyes main roads. I didn't get any pictures because it was late at night."}
{"text":"When this Filiberto's first opened I was over the moon. So great to have one close, and the food was fantastic. I used to eat there three or four times a week. Right up until about late fall of last year. I've given them three chances to make sure the bad food I started getting then wasn't a fluke. Apparently they've just gone bad. Tonight was bitter, over-fried tacos (clearly cooked in old oil). The two times before that were soggy chimis and tasteless sauce. Like another reviewer, when I crave the real thing I'll drive on down to Federico's at 35th and Baseline."}
{"text":"Always come for their carne asada fries. Their guac is a little on the thin side for me but still good none the less."}
{"text":"Love the Tacos on Taco Tuesday!! Make sure to sign up for the Belly App! Points toward free food!!"}
{"text":"Good food but stay close to the bathroom!

Mexican food is great, super greasy and great after a night at the bar."}
{"text":"Not the best location which is sad because it's the closest. The guacamole is like water and the meat is bland. Pretty disappointed"}
{"text":"Wasn't too thrilled about my carne asada torta, it just seemed a little over cooked and dry. Not saying I won't go back but is stay away from the tortas"}
{"text":"I recently starting working in the area and I stop by here for quick Mexican food when I'm on the go.   I usually order the breakfast steak and egg burrito from the drive through, sometimes it's good, and sometimes it's just terrible.  When it's terrible, its usually because they haven't cooked the meat and it doesn't taste right, and smells kinda funky.  It's just mostly hit and miss, depends on your luck I guess.  Also, always new faces in there, so I'm guessing they go through staff fast.   Once I find a good fast food Mexican restaurant in the area, I will probably stop coming here."}
{"text":"Well this is probably the nicest Filibertos I have been to ever! The location is very clean and offers a lot of seating in the dinning area inside and outside. The menu are giant LCD screens, and you have great view of the cooking from the cook window. 

I ordered the carne asada burrito meal, which came with rice and beans and a drink. The food was great!  I almost wanted to order another burrito to go for later, it was that good! The meal was very affordable. 

I've always been very hesitant with these smaller Mexican food places. Some of them are very dirty and disgusting from what I've seen. This place would be at the opposite end of the spectrum for sure."}
{"text":"I've been here on and off over the last few years. Never had a whole lot of issues with the food till recently. Overcooked and very greasy on my recent visit....  

However, I have always had issues with my order.... Particularly a side of chips and salsa.... Which cost $3.24.... When I first went there, it came with a pint of picco de gallo....  Which is reasonable. Then they started to put it directly on the chips. When I said something they handed me a cup of their \"salsa\".... about 1/4 of a cup!!!!  I've normally been able to get that exchanged....  So recently, the cashier lady not only argues with me (to note, I've dealt with her on this very issue before) but made it a point to half ass fill up a pint cup messily with pico de gallo. I gave up arguing with her. And to top off her stupidity, I asked for red sauce. Extra actually. I did order 3 separate items. Soooo I get 3 red sauce, and a bunch of green sauce....

Only comment I have is...

Gross!!!"}
{"text":"THE BEST chips & salsa in these parts! I grew up in New Mexico, and this is the closest I've found in PHX metro to the salsa I miss & love. Chunky, saucy, tomato-onion-chile-cilantro goodness, not like the runny plain taco sauce and/or pico de gallo other restaurants around here serve. And the chips -- so perfectly warm, salty, and crunchy, every time! Highly recommend!!"}
{"text":"Dear Filly B's,

I have loved you long time, we were bff for nearly 10 years... that is until you gave me food poisoning. I will never eat carne asada again thanks to you. I knew we wouldn't last forever, nothing that hot and heavy ever lasts long."}
{"text":"A lot cleaner than other Filiberto's I've been to. The people were really nice and friendly here and got my food out quick... what else do you want? I love coming here for lunch when I'm in the area."}
{"text":"Cheap. Fast. Good. It's Filiberto's! The only downside is coming here late at night when all the drunk idiots hold up the line. Even though it's funny to hear you slur your order it's not funny when you and the 4 people plus the one that's not wearing a seat belt take too damn long to order."}
{"text":"A couple of us from work eat here about once a month, normally pretty good.  Today I ordered carne asada and fries, yes, not the most healthy but had a hankering.  The fries were undercooked and the carne was overcooked.  Usually the food is good, but always have to add salsa for some taste.  Disappointing as it is so close to Luke AFB and could have more business.  Also, turn off the TV with the screaming panel and just play some music in the background."}
{"text":"My husband and I went to Filiberto's Mexican Food to try out the 99 cent tacos. Fantastic. The employees were very nice. Food was amazing. A job well done."}
{"text":"This Filiberto's is always the one to go to on Taco Tuesday. Me and my husband live about 20 minutes away and could go to 3 other closer locations but there is just something about this one that always has us coming back. The tacos always come out hot and cheesy with the perfect amount of meat. Also, the employees are always so friendly and never short you on your choice of sauce. Highly recommend this Filiberto's over all others for any craving at any time."}
{"text":"I have eaten here now for the third time in five days on my vacation. I intend to eat here once again for lunch tomorrow before I get on the plane. Tasty crunchy tacos...I highly suggest the al pastor pork and the spicy tomatillo. Wow. Such a good value."}
{"text":"Great service and delish food! So glad they do delivery now. People work there are extremely friendly. My favorite are their tacos and burritos."}
{"text":"Two words.....Breakfast Burritos. They are awesome. I love filibertos. I dont usually get anything except the breakfast. So stop in and try it. You wont be disappointed."}
{"text":"I have been coming to this place for way over 10 years..... never had a problem  sometimes good sometime  just ok... But last night i went their  and had 3 rolled tacos with quac and light cheese   and had some cucumbers  but only had one cucumber  as i  didnt like the taste of it... when i got home within 15 min i was sicker than a dog  all night  like really sick  almost went to ER .. today was still sick all day   Dont know what the problem was 3 rolled tacos or cucumber  but im pretty much done with this place    Just getting this info out their   Pray no one gets sick like did  I was one really sick girl"}
{"text":"I don't understand the love for this place.  It's okay, and great in a pinch, but mexican food should taste better.  Their steak lacks flavor as if it's cooked hours earlier and left in a steamer. If it's cooked to order I'm shocked by how little flavor it has.  Also I'm confused by this location.  I ordered a chorizo torta because the Filiberto's website says it contains chorizo, eggs, guacamole, lettuce & mayo.  Yet mine contained chorizo egg beans and cheese.  Do each of these places have their own menus?"}
{"text":"Love Filiberto's---love Filiberto's---love Filiberto's!  Everytime is as good as the first!  (But also, the red and green sauce has remained the same---fortunately, we have a goodly supply of Arizona Gunslinger Green Sauce at home!)

Please, Filiberto's, we need a location closer to Cave Creek and Carefree!  I promise I'll come order a #17 at least twice a week!"}
{"text":"Fili B's is definitely hit or miss. This time, it was a miss. I place my order (Carne Asada Burrito and a side of rice), evidently the \"side\" of rice created lots of confusion to the point where I finally just asked for the smallest portion of rice they could provide. There was a car in front of me and for it's always time consuming to get drive thru Mexican Food for whatever reason. So I waited for about 5 minutes or so, not terrible, then it was my turn. I (wrongly) assumed that since I had already waited for 5 or so minutes, my order would be quick to get to me. So, I'm sitting there and handed the drive thru person (who BORDERLINE RUDE-no smile, no greeting, no nothing, just stuck her hand out for the money which I complied with. She took my card and I waited. I was listening to the World Series game and listened through an entire inning before I got even a drink, finally after about 15 minutes she handed me back my card (otherwise I would have taken off) and my burrito and I was free to go. There's so many Mexican places here I don't need to go to Filiberto's and deal with their crap. Next time to remind me to pass."}
{"text":"The first time I came here, I got a carne asada burrito and boy was that burrito packed!! It had a ton of meat in it, although I would have preferred to have a more balanced burrito, the meat was delicious. I also got horchata the first and second time coming here and wasn't impressed either time. I've gotten their other plates that include rice and beans and those don't satisfy my stomach very much, but it is a fast food joint so what do you expect! It's pretty good for a quick Mexican food fix."}
{"text":"Nice and clean please, had the California burrito it was ok, Arizona burrito was average carne asada burrito with melted cheese, clean restrooms price is avegerage."}
{"text":"Best FiliB's! Food is always hot, accurate & delicious! The staff is friendly and seems to take pride in their jobs, which is hard to find today in the service industry especially in fast food. I've come at all hours of the day and they are always consistent. They've also added a lot of new and innovative meals to their menu including really fresh salads and Chipotle Style bowls. Not just a late night guilty pleasure!"}
{"text":"I can confidently say that I've been to almost every Filibertos in the valley (as most of us have). Some good, some ok, some really awful. This is hands down the best Filibertos, we drive past at least two others to get to it. You guys are awesome!"}
{"text":"The only reason that this place got 2 stars instead of 1 is that the onion rings were PHENOMENAL! I also enjoyed the Summer Shandy on draft. Can't find that too many places. Unfortunately, our entree and dessert were terrible. We ordered the salmon with shrimp and pecan pie for dessert. The food was all frozen and pretty tasteless. The worst part was the instant mashed potatoes. Real mashed potatoes are not that hard to make. Maybe we just ordered the wrong food for a Mexican sports bar. Not sure I would go back to try anything else though."}
{"text":"I love filibertos how can you not like this place...open 24 hours, always there never let's you down..with great food and it's around the corner...awesome"}
{"text":"Slow. Higher prices compared to other Filabertos franchise locations throughout the valley."}
{"text":"Good stuff typically better when you're a lil tipsy.  Service is always quick - inside is actually pretty clean but I recommend hitting the drive through and going home to eat.

Best thing... Open 24HRS... So Useful for those awesome breakfast burros :)"}
{"text":"Terribly slow crappy service horrible food gets my order wrong every time. Don't go there's a Taco Bell across the street"}
{"text":"AWFUL. Absolutely awful. The staff here is outright rude and don't bother with drive-thru unless you want to keep your car running for 20 minutes while they ignore you. I've been here 3 times and every time they've taken excessively long to prepare my order and STILL got my order incorrect. When confronted, they argued about it. Seriously, drive the 2 blocks down the road to the other drive-thru Mexican place and save yourself the headache."}
{"text":"I have a love hate relationship here, would never stop coming but I don't know why I do.  They always take forever, but then again they have a decent dollar menu...
Monday- 3 rolled tacos with cheese
Tuesday- Tacos
Wednesday- bean burrito"}
{"text":"It's been a while since I've been to a Filiberto and usually I never have any issues with my food. I was craving Mexican so we decided to come grab some carne Asada fries and some taquitos. When we got home my taquitos looked like it's been sitting out for awhile and the fries were all burnt and old. There literally was nobody at this place and they clearly weren't busy. Was it to much to ask for some fresh food?! No wonder this place has only 2 1/2 stars. We definitely will not be coming back to this place and giving them any of our business. What a waste of money and our dinner sucked!"}
{"text":"Craving a breakfast burrito and we decided we wanted Filibertos for breakfast.  Ordered in the drive thru and the young man's language barrier was so bad that we had to pull up to the window to communicate.  

He repeated our drink order five times. ..not one or twice,  but FIVE times and it was still wrong when we got home.  He didn't understand what root beer was and asked if it was blueberry?  REALLY? We ordered Mt Dew and learned that we got lemonade once we were home.  

Ugh, so frustrating.  I understand is Mexican food,  but at least put someone that can communicate in tyne drive thru window.  Because I'm pissed and im sure he's frustrated or maybe he doesn't give a shit. But you'd think that management would care when their food costs are increased because they have to correct do many mistakes by remaking the food.  

On a positive note,  the inside of the restaurant was very clean when I had to go back in for the wrong item to be corrected."}
{"text":"Your basic 'bertos. Great burritos. Sometimes a little slow in the drive-thru but otherwise everything you'd expect."}
{"text":"Dang, when did Filabertos think they were gourmet food. $6.50 for a breakfast burrito and $2.70 for a coke?!?!?!  I'll be taking my breakfast burro needs elsewhere. And their food quality is not as good anymore. Salsa lost flavor."}
{"text":"Hey MB, thanks for the tip!

This place is mighty dumpy, even for fast food, but the chile relleno burrito is indeed a masterful creation to behold - cheese stuffed chiles, battered and fried, and then stuffed (furthermore) into a flour tortilla with the bedfellows of guacamole and pico de gallo.  

My meals for the rest of the week are going to consist of piles of vegetables."}
{"text":"Delicious Chile rellenos and the super nachos are the bomb.

The customer service takes forever but the food makes up for it. I think that's why drive thru sucks cause they know you gonna come back for the food."}
{"text":"My first experience here wasn't the best so I'll add my second trip to the bottom of this review.  To decide a review on one visit may not be fair, at least not at this point. 
  I had the green chili burrito and the portion size was great.  The only problem was my blood pressure went up twenty points.  The main flavor was salt... Now I love salt as much as the next saltaholic, but my Great Stepmother supposedly cooked for Pancho Villa and I Inherited an awesome chili Verde recipe (aka Green Chili.)  THIS BURRITO. WAS FAR FROM IT. 
  In fact, usually cumin and green chilies are what you're supposed to taste (not salt.) 
  The meat was tender, the staff was friendly, and the restaurant was (pretty clean).  I'll wait for my next trip to finalize my review.
    Second trip wasn't much better... I had the carne asada burrito, it was good. For some reason the other locations seem to have much better food? I've gotten at least one point better food at their other locations.

I've made several trips now and it seems to me that this must be one of the better burrito places in the area, which is disappointing because in San Diego there are many burrito shops with excellent quality food. I suppose it just depends on your expectations and your location."}
{"text":"I ordered two shredded beef enchiladas, and there wasn't much beef but way too much onion. I like onion but, holy cow, every mouthful had huge pieces of onion. In fact there was a huge chunk that wasn't cut up well."}
{"text":"I have always loved Filiberto's, and of the 2 locations near my home, this one always beat out the Val Vista location.  I purchase their hot sauce by the pint, however lately, both the Val Vista and Gilbert locations seem to be adding tomato juice to their hot sauce.  It tastes tinny and is not the same as it used to be.  I will no longer go to Filiberto's if the Gilbert and Baseline location goes downhill.  I stay away from any of their \"meats\" (?)  Super Nachos meat is different than it used to be.  Almost broke a tooth on large piece of bone.  Have gotten raw chicken once in a burrito.  I love the Chili Relleno burrito and is my go to, but needs the old recipe hot sauce."}
{"text":"This location is awful.  Ordered a chicken burrito and it was raw!  Service is bad, too.  I contacted corporate and they said the owner would contact me, but never did.  Hot sauce is different here, too.  I NEVER go to this Filiberto's even though it is the one closest to my home.  Filiberto's restaurants vary greatly which is too bad.  If they improved consistency and had better customer service, it would be great.  The food, when prepared properly, is very good and reasonably priced."}
{"text":"Filibertos is my default if I do not have cash for Rodibertos on Union Hills or just need a burrito ASAP. 

I like most of the things I eat here. Carne Asada, Green Chili, Chicken Asada, beans, rice, all except the beef tacos. They are always over cooked or not enough filling. 

Everything else about this place is good. Clean, Quick, Nice. 

Just check your order before leaving the drive through."}
{"text":"Unless I'm confusing them with a different place, the carnitas tacos here used to come with delicious shredded carnitas. The carnitas taco I got tonight, instead, had these big chunks of pork that didn't seem to have any marinade or seasoning on them at all and they were nasty cuz every chunk of meat was actually at least 50% fat. so gross, I only ate 1 bite and threw the rest in the trash"}
{"text":"Love this place! Such a yummy little restaurant on the west side. I love this place because its such a convenient spot. The drive through is open 24/7, the place is so spacious and they are so quick. They have such a wide variety of Mexican street food, but my all time favorite item there is the Carne Asada burrito. Im so happy i found this place! Will be back often!"}
{"text":"Horrible service. I work close by and my employees and I like to order from this store. We have spent at least 100 a week order multiple orders. Last couple of weeks we have received horrible service and the workers there were actually complaining say\" here come the guys who order a lot of food\" we asked for beans and cheese and didnt get either. If you are planning on ordering from this location I recommend you try some where else. The dont want your business."}
{"text":"This is by far the best Mexican drive-thru in the area. My favorite is their super nachos. I have never had a bad meal when eating their food. 
I no longer live in the area and I miss their food, I have yet to find a place here in the Monterey Peninsula that comes close to the quality of food at Filibertos. 
Every time I am in the AZ I go to Filibertos!"}
{"text":"If you're looking for the typical BIG filibertos burrito, you won't find it here. Theirs are half the size of what you expect of a fili b's burrito, but more expensive. They shouldn't be allowed to call themselves filibertos. Also, we were the only people in the drive thru and our order took about 20 minutes. Not worth the time or money. This was the 2nd time I went here and both times it was exactly the same. Never going back."}
{"text":"Filiberto's is amazing, but skip this location. The food here is the worst"}
{"text":"Went through today because it was the taco happy hour time and 1.49 is a great deal for a couple of tacos. Apparently, they decided to increase by .05 but did not change their signs or give any forewarning of this increase, which is false advertisement. Sure, raise it a couple cents here or there, people won't get mad, but don't charge someone a different price than what is listed. And don't end up like the McDonald's case where a sausage biscuit used to be 1.29 last year but they raised it a few cents here and there and now it's over 2.50. At least the update their signage before charging customers a different price."}
{"text":"Great place to go if you want the wrong order burnt food and for them to waste over an hour of your time. Even better for them to correct your order you will receive the smallest portion you've ever seen."}
{"text":"Best morning burrito on this side of town.

Love getting the burrito with some chips and salsa. 

Large horchata please!! Yumm yumm always go here late night. Open 24hr"}
{"text":"My husband had lunch here today. I had sizzling chicken breasts with mashed potatoes, both were good especially the potatoes, I am kind of a snob about good mashed potatoes. My husband had the salmon with Jasmine rice, he said it was good. Would come again, plates ran around $11. Sports Bar atmosphere, but during middle day quiet and good music playing in background."}
{"text":"This is the second weekend in a row where me and my brother went to get some Carne Asada late at night and we are informed they don't have any. I have NEVER experienced this in any location in the entire valley that does this and I do not think this is acceptable especially that this is the only Mexican food place open in the area at that time. Last night the guy says well we ran out. Well it sounds like you guys need to stick up especially that this has happened two weekends in a row."}
{"text":"Boycott this piece of craziness. Raised prices for taco Tuesday by 40%. Greedy people, don't deal with there BS. I know I won't, that's for sure."}
{"text":"Dirty location inside and out. Even staff look as if they are dirty. I ordered and everything I requested was wrong. Beware of this location."}
{"text":"(For a Mexican fast food restaurant)
 We usually go through their drive thru, not the fastest but food turns out right - at least from my experience. Their food is delicious. My fiancé and I try are hardest to make Taco Tuesday every Tuesday! The shredded chicken tacos are the bomb. Would recommend to any Taco Tuesday supporter. TACO TUESDAY!"}
{"text":"Inexpensive, good, quick Mexican food-what more can you ask for? I got the rolled tacos with cheese and guacamole with a side of rice and beans and for the price it was very good definitely check it out if you're in the area! They also have daily $.99 specials all day and I saw tacos, quesadillas etc. I'll have to try something new next time"}
{"text":"This is the Worst Filibertos I've been to. And I've been to a lot of them all over the valley. I asked him twice to put sour cream and guacamole on the side and it was even on the receipt. Got my food and guess what it was all over the top not on the side. When I asked them about it I got an attitude like I was putting them out if they had to remake it. Since I didn't want spit in my food I just ate it that way which was gross! Oh and I forgot to mention they forgot my drink. The bathroom was disgusting and toilet clogged. I'll NEVER  come here again. I'd advise you all find somewhere else. Too many choices  around to settle for bad bad service!!"}
{"text":"I got the worst food poisoning in my life after eating a carnitas taco. I was so sad because I love carnitas but after this illness experience, I can't get myself to eat them anywhere..."}
{"text":"Pricey for a lowly fast food restaurant. A bean and cheese burro and fountain drink ran me nearly six bucks. That's pretty steep, if you ask me.

Place was clean and there was plenty of seating though."}
{"text":"I take it all back. This place regularly messes up orders (in addition to being slow and ghetto). Screw this Fili's."}
{"text":"I forgot to add that the guy looked at his tip cup tapes to the outside of drive-thru window to see if I gave a tip. I felt bad since I hadn't have any money on me, paid with card, but NOW I'M SO GLAD I DID NOT TIP!!! Getting food poisoning isn't supposed to be on the menu and definitely not what I ordered. I reported them to health dept and surprise to hear they had no complaints for them like mine before. Either people don't know how to file complaint online or they just don't do it. Just google where to file or check out dirty dining on cbs 5 website for how info."}
{"text":"Ate there early this morning they, wait let me start off and say I had two burro's and two horchata's $17 bucks, rip off!! 2nd... the burro was not bigger, then a taco bell burro. I have been too plenty of Filli b's and this place just robs you. Usually the burro is like a baseball bat, the big end this burro was like a pencil. Then top it off $17 bucks, I could of got three pizza's at Hungry Howie's for that price!!!!!!!!!!  Rip off...... Alert !!!!!!!!! Explain to girl in drive thru window,she basically LOL !!!"}
{"text":"Worst Mexican food in the West Valley burritos are cold the service is horrible me... 
It takes a lot for me to give a bad review but this play this earth one star No more"}
{"text":"Ever since my bad experience with the uncooked rice, this restaurant has been right on the mark with the rice and everything else.  I highly recommend this Filiberto's, the food is good!"}
{"text":"Would've been five stars but my experience with this location is always been pleasant however the prices vary from visit to visit every time I go I usually go late at night I don't know if that makes a difference other locations sell an item for 2 to 3 dollars less sometimes I don't get it otherwise the staff has been great and Are usually just order a burrito on the way home and they've always been great"}
{"text":"Got a steak and egg breakfast burrito! was actually quite good and really filling. Was dead inside when I showed up so the food came out quick! Clean inside and that was welcoming. Will stop in again!"}
{"text":"The food was rather good. Not the best we've had yet in the Valley but certainly the best from a \"take out\" place. A bonus of convenience is available here as the drive thru is open 24 hours, something I found pleasantly surprising. Prices are average, which is to say not out of line by any means, but not a slam dunk steal either.

Service seemed to be lacking though as a question about the number of enchiladas included in the meal was not received well and the answer had to come from someone else, who answered like it was inconvenient.

The chile relleno was delicious but oddly one was mild and the other very hot. The enchiladas were tasty but fairly average as were the fish tacos."}
{"text":"There's nothing fancy about this place. And it shouldn't be fancy. All you need to know is that it's REAL Mexican food, with a good chance of getting sick and also a good chance of getting robbed while eating at the tables. 

This neighborhood is somewhat dangerous. I ate at a taco stand in Mexico and had the same two feelings. It's legit.

The unhealthy food tastes good!"}
{"text":"The best of all the local 'bertos and fast food Mexican places around. I used to think they were all the same until I went here for their burrito special. I believe I got the green chile, delicious! As an added bonus they have a salsa bar with chips while you wait!"}
{"text":"was gonna give an easy 4 star at least but my last experience here sucks. I ordered california burrito, chicken torta and a horchata w/o ice. after I paid, I noticed that the girl over the counter (who wasn't smiling at all and was CHEWING GUM WHILE SERVING FOOD/TALKING TO CUSTOMERS) charged me an extra 5 dollars something for a chimichanga I didn't order. Not apologizing, and being veryyyy sloooow, and asking me 3 times if I wanted my horchata with ice, I waited an extra 30 minutes for them to understand what I really ordered and what mistake they did. Another guy stepped in and comped the chimichangas and gave me 6 bucks back and apologized sincerely. I completely understand that these kind of things happen, specially with the resto being busy. Just can't take the attitude of that girl with the gum."}
{"text":"I live near this place and have been eating there for over 12 years, sometimes several times a week.  The only reason I eat there is because it is next door to my house and convenient and cheap.  I am typically a very busy person because of work and school, so I often have no choice but to grab fast food.  Their enchiladas are subpar, their burritos are inconsistent, and they over the years have had nearly the worst service I've ever experienced at Mexican restaurants.  Burrito Express and Tacqueria Mi Casita are both horrible with service as well.  Over the past 12 years I have gotten sick at Filiberto's probably 15 times.  I got food poisoning once.  I literally will not eat there unless I simply have no choice because of the amount of time I don't have to cook being a busy guy.  They do have great daily specials and there are times I really crave their beef tacos with green chili.  When they get decent cooks who put in a lot of effort, their food can on some days be incredibly good.  Over the years their cashiers have tried to rip me off no less than 20 times.  Always calculate your orders and taxes.  They consistently screw up my orders and overcharge me.  I sometimes hate going there but I often have to.
On days when I am not busy I never eat there.  I go to Mucho Taco at Ray & Alma.  They have the best ingredients, food quality, and their food tastes like gourmet food, like a chef made it who had his own recipe.  Their food is the best Mexican food anywhere.
Filiberto's is one of those places where you live and die by them, but accept that it is a necessary evil.  I started a Facebook group page called Food Poisoning at Filberto's after the last time I got sick there.
They have their good days, but their bad days will put you in the hospital and on the toilet for days.  I am not exaggerating either.  The only other place to give me food poisoning is Buffalo Wild Wings."}
{"text":"Doesn't take coupons. Crappy, rude service. Doesn't do taco Tuesday. 
They don't have air conditioning on when it's 90+ degrees out. This is a joke for this type of chain."}
{"text":"I agree with Adrian and D T, and Gabriela. They used to have good food. Now they screw it up every time and don't care. Try to do the contact on their website and it just says in-proper date, you can put the date in 8 different ways and nothing changes. It's really hard to not become prejudice when you weren't before moving here but now that your hear the Mexicans at Filberto's can't speak any English, they are rude, they lie and they don't care about your service."}
{"text":"Super convenient and tasty big burritos. Of course inflation has kicked in over the last ten years, but's its the same, fast & good food!"}
{"text":"I absolutely love this place!!! The shredded beef tacos are out of this world.  They are simple, yet so good!! Would definitely recommend trying them with the red sauce..."}
{"text":"I have tried giving  Filiberto's three chances for improvement, each in a different location. Yet, with each visit I am more disappointed. I have to say that the one on Guadalupe Rd is the worst I have ordered from. Not only was the customer service a disaster, almost borderline rude, but the tortilla for my shredded beef burrito tasted old and crispy. Flour tortillas are not supposed to taste like that. The next time I want some quick Mexican food, I am going to stop by Moreno's Mexican Grill, even if it is a bit farther away than a Filiberto's. I gave it two stars, because they do have complimentary chips and salsa bar, and so that does deserve some merit."}
{"text":"My husband and I stopped in after church and never had such terrible service in this resturant.  My husband's dinner was cold and when I brought it back to the waitress she looked at me like I was crazy.  I told her the burritos were ice cold and so were the beans and rice.  I asked for the manager, who was standing there, and she looked at it, touched it and threw it in the garbage.  No one said I'm sorry, or I'll get you another dinner.  I returned my dinner also as we were very upset with the service and asked for a refund.  The waitress acted like she didn't want to be there.  She wouldn't answer the phone and that kept ringing.  Also another family returned their meals 3 times and she was aggrevated with them for doing this.  We have stopped at this establishment many times after church and never received such terrible service.  We will not be going back."}
{"text":"Grabbed takeout after a long 48 hrs of moving and we were famished. It was the first place I caught off the freeway near several other fast food stops and gas stations. Received fast and prompt, friendly takeout in their 24 hr drive-thru. Anyone driving through here for takeout I'd advise to make a wide turn up to their window since the corner is a little sharp once u drive past the menu window where you order. 

Best item we odered on the menu was the oreo churros and the oreo icing.  As for the shredded chicken chimichanga and the enchiladas, they were flavorful but far too salty for my taste. Their portions are very generous. Easily could have shared between 2-3 people per entree. Overall, our experience was okay, but not for me to return."}
{"text":"Horrible everything.  The unfriendly service, the booths that are falling apart, overpriced bland food.  Go across the street to Roliberto's."}
{"text":"The food taste like Mexico. Favorites are the Chili Relleno plate and the shrimp plate"}
{"text":"I came into this particular FiliB's after a night of drinking. The cashier was new I presume as she screwed up my order twice. I didn't care. Mexican delight was about to hit my stomach and make me regret the night or morning...so excited. Another cashier came over and screwed up my order two more times. They both kept trying to persuade me to get five tacos instead of four. Then they fed me some line of bs that they couldn't sell me individual tacos...only the special. I got frustrated enough to just take the damn combo. I also got a carne asada burrito without pico de gallo with guacamole, a bacon burrito for my friend and some pollo asado and carne asada mini tacos(the combo I was pressured into getting). Total: Like $16 and some change.

The drunk munchies are the best. The carne asada and pollo asado mini tacos were soooo delicious. They filled me up so much with the free chips and salsa and those spicy carrots and jalapenos that I couldn't start on my burrito. The burrito looked so delicious but I knew if I forced it down...I would further regret coming to FiliB's. One mistake at a time. I would save the burrito for the next day and microwave it. Luckily, my fridge gets cold enough to freeze and my freezer gets cold enough to ruin food in. My friend said his burrito was good too. The sauce though...we came in super late, it was so watery from sitting all day. I bet it would've been way better in the morning or lunch."}
{"text":"This is truly the best filabertos around. The items they continue to add to their menu is great. Never a complaint."}
{"text":"Death by taco.  Death by taco is a cheap way to go.  I like their tacos and other dishes but I have a feeling it's killing me slowly.  So much lard or grease.  Tasty and cheap.  My son who loves junk food is fearful of eating there.  For me, I live on the wild side and face death to enjoy some cheap Mexican food."}
{"text":"This particular Filibertos location has consistently been among the worst I've been to, and I've been to most of them. I don't know if this franchise has different recipes or just gets their ingredients from other lower quality sources than others, but whatever they do differently, its not good.

Beans are always bland. In fact, nearly everything at this one is more bland than others. Burritos tend to be smaller too. Even the hot sauce is weird at this one.

On the plus side, they have an every day dollar menu, which most simply don't have.  This includes cinnamon chips!  Those are awesome and I wish every Filibertos had them. 

Go to Val Vista and Baseline. Its a close alternative, and FAR  superior food."}
{"text":"Being a fan of 'berto's, I was delighted to see this place under construction just 2 miles from my home. Now that it's been open for several months, I've given them time to sort out their growing pains.

Initially, service was unbelievably slow, especially in the drive-thru. More than once I sat for 15 minutes (and sitting in an open car in the middle of Buckeye is no treat for the olfactorily sensitive, let me tell you), even when I was the only customer and just ordering an Arizona burrito and horchata. It's gotten somewhat better since then, but still tends to be slower than other drive-thrus. Counter service is a bit less slow.

The food quality itself is, unsurprisingly, on par with other 'berto's. Dinner combos are freakin' huge and the Mexican drinks (horchata, tamarindo, and jamaica) are delicious.

This location has locally-made chocolate and caramel flan. I absolutely do NOT recommend it; the chocolate texture is just weird and has a strange, almost pine-ish undertaste.

I stop in once a week or so, usually on my way home after a very long day at work when I'm too tired to think about cooking dinner. Otherwise, I generally don't bother."}
{"text":"Preface to everything: I was the only one there and the lady looked at me several times without even acknowledging me for over 10 minutes while she did something else. Absolutely SH** customer service. WHEN SHE FINALLY DID TALK TALK TO ME SHE WAS RUDE AND IMPOLITE. I hope she's not one of the people that thinks she should make $15/hour mininum?

I used to rate any Filibertos 5 star. They all suck now. I will continue to post my experiences as I get many different burritos, and occasionally am stuck with Filibertos...

However, lately, 6/6 times I am disappointed to the max.

Shame on Fillibertos, RAISING THEIR PRICES, REDUCING THE FOOD QUANTITY, WATERING DOWN THEIR SALSAS, AND SERVING DRY MEAT.

I just had a Adobada burrito,I usuallly look forward to the juiciness that is the adobada meat. THE MEAT IN MY BURRITO WAS BONE DRY. 

Out of every Adobada burrito I've ever had this was by far the driest and lease flavorful. IT TASTED LIKE DRY MEAT, NOT ADOBADA. 

Because of my SEVERAL recent terrible encounters I would back a boycott its so bad!!"}
{"text":"Sorry Filiberto fans but we just had one open in my area.  I thought, geez everyone raves about their food and admittedly I am not a HUGE Mexican food fan but I eat a few things.  I went for a breakfast burrito.  The one I chose had eggs, meat and beans.  I asked for some sour cream and it was an extra I think $2.00!  It was very poorly constructed.  I went to pick it up to eat it and it fell apart in my lap, and I was on my way to work.  Luckily had something to protect my lap.  Wound up throwing it out after spending $9.00 and going to Senor Taco for my favorite burrito.  Filiberto's needs to have the recipe for their breakfast burrito revamped."}

{"text":"I have eaten at the convenient taco shop many times.  Usually it is tasty, quick and affordable. Today I stopped by at about 5:45pm. I ordered the #2 meal, 2 beef tacos, rice and beans.  Easy enough right?  Well I was very disappointed.  The rice and beans were about the same as always but the tacos ......???  Yikes!   Seriously the beef was like beef jerky. Dry and HARD! When I pay $10 for a couple tacos I do expect them to be edible otherwise I can go to Taco bell or Del Taco!  Please consider checking your quality control. Thanks 
Your loyal customer~~"}
{"text":"It's Filiberto's. They are all similar, but differ considerably in food quality and service.

This one is the best Filiberto's I've been to. Still no \"neat and clean\" feel to it, but the food is better than average for Filiberto's.

Like any Filiberto's, the burritos come with pure meat. Wanna add rice or beans? It'll cost ya! Wait... they have to remove meat to fit the rice/beans. Rice and beans are cheaper than meat! Why on earth would anyone charge more money when they are saving money??!?  Senseless."}

I particularly enjoyed the screaming, bible thumping freaks protesting the planned parenthood which wasn't even open yet. Not Filiberto's fault but it didn't help the ordering process nor my hangover. Thanks guys! The tortilla surrounding the questionable 'steak' was really good but that was it... thumbs down."}
{"text":"I go here cause it's right around the corner from my work and not much is open for my lunch break at 4am. The people taking orders haven't gotten my order right on the first try once. Food is usually pretty...blah.... Even for a crappy Mexican place. Today I got my breakfast burrito and get to the last quarter of it and start feeling something crunchy. Bacon, egg, cheese, tortilla. What's crunchy? Eggshell. Ok. Fresh eggs. It happens from time to time. But I seriously got enough shell for about 1/3 of an egg. I'm done. Avoid this place. I know all of the \"berto\" restaurants are about the same. Find another one."}
{"text":"DO NOT EAT HERE!!!!!! My fiance, our friend and I went here because they were hungry. When we returned home, my fiance opened his burrito to put hot sauce in and a cockroach crawled out of it! It was disgusting. 
When we took the food back for a refund, the girl at the counter acted as if it wasnt a surprise at all, like it was normal to have bugs crawl out of their food. No problems with a return, however, but I wouldnt eat here if you paid me!"}
{"text":"This filibertos is the first one ive been to that sucked. The girl who took our order was not paying attention and gave ur carnitas instead of chicken. Im allergic to carnitas n had i eaten it i would not be writing this review. Plz pay attention to the customers .no stars deserved."}
{"text":"This was my 1st time here and I am impressed! We went thru the drive thru, ordered 2 grilled chicken burritos and 1 sausage potato and eggs burrito.

My sausage burrito was delish! Not greasy, full of flavor and HUGE!  The chicken burrito tasted yummy but were very soggy, not sure if it was from the chicken or the pico, it was not a burrito we could have eaten in the car.

The service was very good, quick, and our order was correct... What more could you ask for?  Over all I was impressed and will be going back :)"}

{"text":"I'm on a Mexican food kick, and realized besides Los Taquitos and Arribas there's also one of the 'Bertos close by. I told my husband where I was heading and he gave me a dubious look.... Right there I should have re-thinked my meal plan. 
Ordered through drive thru, carne asada fries and three rolled tacos with cheese/guac. Food was ready fast. While driving home, the delicious smell I was expecting that usually makes me want to start eating in my car wasn't there. It smelled like grease, old grease. Got home and got a bite of taco.... Ugh no. It tasted like it have been fried a couple of times... several days ago. Then tried the carne asada fries....Meh, super salty. 
I mean, I wasn't expecting healthy food, greasy food can be delicious but this was not, at all!!! I started feeling disgusted while trying to eat the fries and didn't even looked back at the tacos. Sadly, it all ended in the garbage and I hate to throw out food.  Maybe I should have ordered a burrito or had some drinks before coming here. I'll give them a try again, but in the very distant future when I can think about Bertos without feeling nauseous."}
{"text":"I pulled up to the window and the lady was rude, couldn't even understand her. I ordered a burrito and a drink, didn't tell me what my total was, just said ok. I got to the window and she just said what my total was.   I didn't get my drink, she didn't even put it on the order, and the burrito was subpar. I will never go to this location again"}
{"text":"Bleh. Super greasy, super overpriced, kill me.

I like that they're open 24 hours, but it's not worth anything if the food isn't good. I got the two taco combination platter and the carne asada fries and that came up to $17. You'd expect decent food for that price, but instead, you're given below frozen food quality. 

The two Taco platter came with two beef tacos soaked in grease, some refried beans with greasy cheese on top, and rice for a whopping $8 and change. That's insane considering tacos are about $2 a piece. Again, soaked in grease. The taco shells could have been mistaken for soft shells because they were so soggy and greasy. 

The carne asada fries, while conceptually good with guacamole, sour cream, cheese, and meat, were almost just as disappointing. The meat was very chewy, somewhat dry, and really salty, even for me. Did I mention greasy? 

It'd be one thing if they were cheaper, but for $17 to be served that level of food is highway robbery. Absolutely horrible. And to think, Taco Bell is right next them. If you've ever been to Taco Bueno, Taco Cabana, or the numerous other competitors, they're all Michelin star restaurants compared to this. Did I forget to mention the food was insanely greasy? On the bright side, they are open 24 hours, so if you're dying of hunger, you can go in use their phone to call an ambulance to take you to the nearest hospital rather than pay $17 for that food."}
{"text":"Yuck. I went around 2:30 am to the 24 hour pickup. The food was greasy, doughy, and tasteless. It might be the worst Mexican food I have ever had."}
{"text":"my wife told me to not go to filiberto's.  i should have listened.  but, being relatively new to the valley (moved here 2 years ago) and a big fan of mexican food, i wanted to try it out.

i'm never...eating...there...again.

large portions of bland, tasteless slop.  the refried beans lacked texture.  the burrito could have been made by a bobble-head doll.  it completely lacked any kind of thought behind it.  ground hamburger rolled up in an amateurish tortilla with the token green pepper.  that was it.  my one question is, how are they still in business?  i'm repulsed by their existence and continued success.  taco bell is an infinitely better option than filiberto's."}
{"text":"The place says 24 hrs. The door was open we went to place our order. Guess what? There closed. Terrible."}
{"text":"Great new building and this one didn't get swallowed up by that Julioberto's crap that's infecting several Filiberto's locations.  Consistent food that you definitely need to be in the mood for.  Chips and salsa in the dining room now, and no more bad seating.  Good show."}
{"text":"Super nacho rules!!!!!"}
{"text":"Very fast drive thru. My bacon burrito was a little on the soft bacon side for me. Ask for cruncy and it would have been a ten. I added pico to it great flavor combo as good as at home. Tortillas were fresh always a plus."}
{"text":"I went there cause I was hungry...The one by my home better food...The meat was dry...The  green sauce was watered down ...not very impressed at all ..I'll continue to go to one near my home nice and fresh... and love the food there...This place just fell short"}
{"text":"Filberto's #10, near Dobson and  Elliot,

I ordered a Beef Burrito and when I got home and took a bite out of it, it turned out to be a Bean Burrito. I ate it anyway, because I didn't feel like driving all the way back to complain. The other part I want to complain about is their website, which has a page for complaining, but is designed in such a way as to make it impossible to actually send the complaint to the company. One of the required fields you have to fill in is the 'Date' in order to send the complaint. But no matter how you enter the date it comes back with \"Date format seems invalid\". This effectively makes it impossible to send a complaint. Now I'm actually pissed off enough to actually start a Yelp account."}

Fili, you are my lover that never sleeps, the stranger in the night with cold horchata and a mountain of steak, beans, and cheese you call the SUPERNACHO.  Super it is..."}
{"text":"Probably the worst Fillibertos I've visited. I normally have their \"Giant Breakfast Burrito.\" They must use their stale tortillas because they always seem to flake and break. They advertise them for  $3.99 because I think that there is only 1 scrambled egg inside. If you're craving Mexican, pass this one up."}

I was informed that this store had NO BACON and could not fulfill my order for a Bacon burrito.
Sunday morning - No bacon! WTF?"}
{"text":"Yum.  Okay so I have only been here at about 2am after a night out....so yes my judgment may be impaired at that time...however I always order the \"country\" burrito...eggs, cheese, potatoes....and the burritos are so big that I always have left overs...so the next day when I wake up I eat it for breakfast and it's even better than before so that being said...it must be good!

Have tried the Carne Asada Burrito which is also better than the competitors in this same market....they seem to use better meat here.

The men are always nice and the people around the area are sometimes a bit shadier than I'd hang with but I've never had a problem going here.

I would love for them to have shredded beef....not what they call shredded beef which ends up looking like beef stew...but actual shredded desebrada beef....that would be super."}
{"text":"I got a burrito and it was fine. Not as good as Roberto's in Las Vegas. My complaint is the menu. It doesn't say what is in each item. At the very least there should be a picture so I can figure it out. I asked what was in three different burritos before I ordered. The person working the the counter was very helpful."}
{"text":"I never eat here by choice. Occasionally my husband brings it home and that's what I get to eat as well. Unless you are in the mood to visit the toilet throughout the night, steer clear. Ugh. The food isn't even good!"}

Also the place was overpriced for the quality presented and provided, if you wanted to add other ingredients to burrito bowl it will cost you at least 15 dollars, and still you want be completely happy. 

I hope they will work at the quality of the food presented"}
{"text":"No stars. They didn't give us our burrito and we showed them the receipt and had to argue in order to get the burrito that WE PAID FOR! Finally got the burrito and then noticed that there was no guac on the carne asada fries. Went back and asked for guac because they forgot it and they refused. Tried to charge me $1.29. GUAC COMES ON CARNE ASADA FRIES!!! Rip off. Never going back ever."}
{"text":"So this is supposed to be 24 hours? Or at least open till 2 am or 10 pm as per the window signs. But it is currently 9 pm on a Sunday and the lobby is locked and the we knocked and the employee looked right at us and gestured with her hand under her neck like \"no go\" or something. Then she walked immediately to the back. Well still kind of wanting the food, we go through the drive thru and she immediately answers. We ask for one sec to think and then after a short time say we're ready and there is no answer or voice for the next 3 minutes, we actually backed out and drove back up to see and then finally she asked what we wanted and we ordered and paid. She was overall rude and it makes no sense that the lobby should be locked WITH PEOPLE INSIDE EATING and yet she looked right at us and chose not to let us in."}

{"text":"Worst Filibertos in the valley. I live in Gilbert and keep telling myself that won't go back, today was the last time going. I waited for two egg, cheese, and potato burritos. Ended up getting a refund because after 20 min they still didn't have them ready and they couldn't tell me when they would be ready. I ask the the little girl at the register how long on the burritos she said \"oh I don't know\" and walked away. Every time I have been in this location, you wait forever and the people behind the register are clueless with horrible customer service. Corporate need to visit this franchise!"}

I had to ask again for my #10. The chicken tacos were impossible to tell if they were chicken.  The lady that presented the order couldn't recall that there were two meals in the order.  She actually challenged me and I has to show her my receipt.  As I said -- nobody else in the restaurant!  Just inedible.  
  Looking at the signs outside, it appears that this used to be another restaurant.  The same fate awaits this place.  Just terrible."}
{"text":"Feels odd reviewing a Fili-B's.  However, they are consistent and polite.  This one is a bit more expensive that some of the others."}
{"text":"Excellent customer service is imperative, this location does not have that. Visited this location on 4/29/14 around 10:45PM and the girl that took our order was rude. I'm chalking down that she hates her job and probably her life. Granted, she did say \"thank you\" once, so she has some hope of success in customer service. It's nice this location is open 24hr and 70% of the time they get your order right. I'll drive to another location for my hungover needs."}
{"text":"I ordered a bean burrito enchilada style. I didn't know I was also ordering explosive diarrhea and vomiting the entire next day. I enjoy a lot of Mexican food and this was definitely disappointing. There are many better Mexican food options."}
{"text":"The Tenorio brothers (\"Filiberto\" being the eldest) opened their first fast-food restaurant in San Diego, and soon after, one on Main Street in Mesa. I used to live near and eat at that second location, and trust me -- when their company website says it was an \"instant success\" and \"people lined up\" to eat there, they aren't exaggerating!

Today, Filibertos boats 28 restaurants in Arizona and California. The newest addition in Chandler lacks the reverse-ambiance of the original one that occupied an abandoned Jack-in-the-box, but the food is the same. 

Filibertos falls somewhere between a Taco Bell or Del Taco and a full-fledged, full-priced Mexican restaurant. But that's a good thing when you want better-than-fast-food but only want to spend around 5 bucks. Filibertos has become my go-to choice for comfort (read: fattening) Mexican food. Some days I would give the eatery 3 and sometimes even 5 stars, when the food is especially fresh and not too greasy, but overall I'll play it safe with a 4. 

My personal faves are the Arizona burrito with cubed beef, potatoes and cheese and the Chile Rellenos plate, while my husband prefers the Adobada burrito and the fish tacos. Note: it helps if you intend to get your order to go, since many locations offer limited or no seating."}
{"text":"I really don't understand the negative reviews! This FillyB's location is the cleanest I have ever seen and the workers have always been courteous and the food is as good as FillyB's food can get compared to other locations.

Seriously I'm always amazed at how clean this location is."}

{"text":"On Friday, May 11th, my son and I had had a very long, busy day. At around 9:30 at night, while driving home, we decided to grab a quick bite for dinner.  At the drive-through, we ordered a taco and cheese enchilada, an order of 4 rolled tacos, along with two medium sodas.  Total came to $28.22! We drove up to the window to pay, and while waiting, for our food and contemplating the high price, a COCKROACH casually walked across the window ledge.  It was there for about 30 second before the girl at the window came back and it jumped off!  We took the food home and promptly threw it in the outside trash can without even eating it.  Disgusting and expensive!"}
{"text":"My first time at this place. Walked in and was helped immediately by the nice young lady up front. Food came out at s reasonable time and the food was amazing. Very reasonable on price. Very clean restaurant as well. Stop by if your in the area. You won't regret it"}
{"text":"I usually love Filiberto's but this one gave us meat that was about to go bad.  We could tell by the \"off\" taste when we were eating it, and the sour stomach after the fact.  The server at the counter was a total b*tch and rolled her eyes when my fiancé asked for an extra bag.  Living in south Phoenix, there are plenty of places to go for good Mexican food--just not here."}
{"text":"This place has the worst god-awful crappy beans on earth.

Even outside at the drive-through it smells like cheap toxic cleaning products. Did someone drop a urinal cake?

What keeps Filibertos in business are Twentyfourseven hours and drunk people. 
Conveniently located in every lower-middle class Phoenix Metropolitan neighborhood.

Urban legends are built upon places like this."}
{"text":"I am normally not a fan of these chains but I really like this location! The food is always hot, fresh, and tasty. They give you a ton of meat too. 

Great place for Taco Tuesday. Large beef of chicken tacos for $1.99. I love the chicken tacos. They give you a ton of chicken, fresh lettuce and cheese, and the crunchy shell is amazing. Top it off with their green sauce and I'm a happy camper! 

Highly recommend for taco Tuesday. Grab yourself a churro for dessert!"}
{"text":"Hands down the best breakfast burrito. Wow is all I can say. Fresh, well seasoned, with sauces on the side and some pico de gallo.  This food will make your eyes roll back in your head!!!"}
{"text":"I know, 4 stars for Fili Bs. This specific location has THE best tortillas. I have only checked in 2x but have been her far more than that. Usually late night and mostly Sunday or Saturday I think. The first time I noticed these tortillas there was a sweet woman working the window. I swear she made my tortilla right then. Probably not, but it certainly tasted like it.

Fili Bs has never been my favorite place, it has always been a late night spot. However, this location has killer tortillas on a good night (happens to be when I go). I will admit I think I grabbed carne tacos once and hated them but the last several (more than 5) times I have ordered burritos, the tortilla gets me. 

Good job whoever makes them with love, it's totally working!"}
{"text":"The California Burrito is so damn good! Every time I come here from the East Coast I gotta have 1 or 3!"}
{"text":"I called and spoke to the so-called manager they don't understand English or they act like they don't  did she get their shit together so aggravated with that place it's like the second time I've had a problem there actually the third time  she didn't think it was that big of a deal that I was going to post this on Yelp  she told me thank you . How stupid Well for example I asked them for ground beef tacos and they couldn't fill that second of all I asked for the tostadas to be in a separate container they couldn't fulfill that they don't have idea what they're doing over there they should get their shit together I'll never eat there again they suck it's the worst Filibertos in town if you can avoid it I would"}
{"text":"Blech, yech, YUCKY.

Complete and utter disappointment.  I'd sooner go to Taco Bell and Del Taco before I would ever set foot in Filiberto's, Rigoberto's, Aliberto's or any of the 'bertos in that chain.

Yuckity yuck yuck yuck YUCK.

Did I say YUCK?

Best Mexican by far I've found here has to be Rosa's."}
{"text":"how the f uck yall out of menudo every sunday
?????????????
??????????????????????????????????????"}
{"text":"Very friendly staff. Clean Men's Bathroom. Tasty food. Big Salsa Bar. Oreo Churros. Celing fans. TV's. The best FILABERTOS that I have found. My son's asked me to bring them back for supper??? I had the STEAK RANCHERO BREAKFAST PLATTER. I could not eat it all. A good coice for two people to share. My sons had cheese quesadillas. NO COMPLAINTS??? Cheers."}
{"text":"Been here several times in the past & it feels like it suddenly fell off a cliff. This is not the place to eat anymore.  Ordered one fish taco & 2 beef tacos, drive thru rep was abrupt & very Short when ordering. I know it is not a nice place but a hello and how can I help you would be nice. So, lets get to the food, fish tacos, under cooked & not tasty, beef tacos totally skimpy on the beef & full of lettuce. Next time I will check Yelp for reviews, they have always pointed us in the right direction!"}
{"text":"Placed a to go order here tonight, not only did it take abnormally long to get my food but forgot 2 of my items. So frustrating, will definitely not be back."}
{"text":"I've gotten their carne asada burritos and their carne asada fries. Both were delicious choices.
However, this morning I got their bacon,  egg & potato breakfast burrito.  There was hardly any eggs,  and maybe a tablespoon worth of bacon. And it didn't even look or feel like real bacon.  The rest was all potato.  I wish I had taken a picture. 
I'll just be sticking to the other entrees and save the breakfast burritos for the other place a little further down the street."}
{"text":"This is the best filibertos in Gilbert. Great service the food is always hot always quick. I actually drive past two other filibertos to hit up this one. The rolled tacos are amazing in California burrito is to die for.

If you're driving past stop in and get a California burrito you won't be disappointed"}
{"text":"I love filibertos in general, but this location is very hit and miss, this goes for the food and the service. They recently upped their prices , which is fine but the quality of the food should have least stayed the same.

More times then not the inside of my carne asada burrito is cold, not lukewarm but actually cold. Their breakfast burritos are very good and so are the rolled tacos. but if you have a choice, choose a different filibertos or even a whole different Mexican place."}
{"text":"I go to Filiberto's a lot. I really like greasy Mexican food. However, they are extremely inconsistent with their quality of food and service. Generally they provide adequate food and service. However, the drive through is always slow. If you have a short lunch break than this probably isn't the best place to grab lunch. It is about a 50/50 chance that they will get your order wrong. I often receive the wrong drink or food. They once forgot to put the cheese on a bean and cheese burrito. I also think that they are over priced for the quality of food you are getting. However, if you want greasy Mexican food, than this is an OK option."}
{"text":"Despite what the cups say this place is just another average \"bertos\". This chain may not be related the the rest of them but its still a run of the mill taco shop. Nothing on the menu really stands out as interesting or unique and nothing I've tried so far has been better than average. Tacos, carne asada fries, carne asada burrito, rice, beans, tostadas all are just okay. The prices arent too bad so thats a plus, and they have a daily special for every day of the week so if you like taco tuesdays or cheese quesadilla thursdays you wont be disappointed.  The staff is helpful and nice."}
{"text":"Great location and friendliest staff. Been here a few times now and each time is a delight. Everything tastes fresh as well as very clean."}
{"text":"I was the only one in line, didn't see anyone in the dining area. Super slow drive thru. I think their burritos cost more than the other filiberto that's on Elliot/McQueen. I asked for guacamole in my burrito, didn't get it, but was charged. Burritos are also smaller than the Filibertos that I just mentioned. Saving grace-it taste decent. 

I'm sticking to the Elliot and McQueen location. Food taste like it's better quality and faster service."}
{"text":"So lets just be clear here, I love Hole in the wall joints. Particularly Mexican hole in the wall joints. While I wouldn't actually categorize this place as hole in the wall, I noticed some of the reviews seemed concerned about that. I wouldn't be. This is like going to El Pollo Loco or Taco Bell. During my stay in Scottsdale I went twice. Once for breakfast, and once for Lunch. 

Breakfast was absolutely delicious, with one small exception. I had a Bacon burrito with rice added (I highly recommend adding rice to breakfast burritos! its good). It was well wrapped, not too messy, plenty huge, and easy to eat in the car. The one complaint I had was the cheese. It was this bright neon orange gelatinous stuff. It just tasted oily and not very good. 

I also had the Super Nachos or Nachos supreme or whatever its called. Same problem, the cheese was just too greasy and oily. It didn't have much flavor. On the plus side, they pile on the sour cream, guacamole, and meat. It would have been nice to have some beans on the nachos too though.

I would go back for a Breakfast burrito (sans the cheese), but thats about it."}
{"text":"I know a few diehard Filiberto's fans, so I've given it a fair shot. We've ordered from this location 3 times in the last 6 months and it's never good. The service is slow and not very friendly and the food lacks flavor. Last time we went, it was over $30 for 4 people not including drinks. For that kind of \"fast food,\" I want consistent yummy food...not here! I'd rather eat Taco Bell."}
{"text":"They are way over priced and they don't give you your bang for your buck. Very skimpy on the meats. I wouldn't recommend, but if you do decide to try then prepare yourself for a seven dollar burrito before taxes"}
{"text":"the portions at this place is terrible, i recently got a chorizo burrito with extra beans and the thing looked like a damn taco bell burrito. the size of it was a laugh, and i'm not picky when it comes to size much but they could have at least tried to make it look decent. i ended up paying around 7.50 for a dinky little burrito and it wasn't worth it at all. there are many other better 24 hr mexican drive through places that will give you proper portions and costs. these guys just wanna take your money. i wouldn't recommend this location or any location for that matter. i haven't had a good experience with filiberto's since the early 2000's. don't waste your time or money, take it from me. i eat mexican food a lot, and avidly go to 24 hour locations, and this chain will no longer be a place i'll go"}
{"text":"This is the best Filibertos I've ever been at other than the one in Sossamam and Guadalupe.  Beans are really good and Burritos are reallt big. Their jr burritos looked like the big burritos in other filibertos plus they still offer the carne asada torta combo for only 5 dollars, no other filibertos does it any more. Good place."}
{"text":"Lots of food for great price.  Quick service.  I had the carne asada plate.  The steak was chopped up already.  Not my preference and it was a little bland.  I'd come here again and try something else though.  Nice sauce bar."}
{"text":"Way better than Taco Bell and more expensive in a way.... However 2 tacos and a pinto and cheese are almost $8 at Taco Bell so maybe the same price. The carne asada quesadilla with shrimp and sautéed onions was a big hit! 
My son loves the carne asada fries with lettuce and tomato! Good food, drive thru, not fast.
Please comment and follow me for more reviews!"}
{"text":"I don't know about you but I crave a great breakfast burrito, and have found a favorite one at Filibertos, a friend from Colorado just moved into my hood, very excited to have her here! she asked me if I wanted to go get a fast breakfast and where to go, told her you got a spot right up the street from ya! So off we went.

Now my favorite is the country breakfast burrito, its eggs, potatoes, cheese, simple like I like it, but I have them toss in some fresh jalapenos and pico de giao and man that is pure heaven! Love it!

My friend ordered the bacon burrito and halfway through it she was like damn that's alot of bacon lol good to know the bacon burrito really has bacon in it and not just a strip or 2.

Yep I'm sure I'll be back!"}
{"text":"This Chandler and Alma School location never fails to surprise. I like Filiberto's but this place seems a bit pricier than some of the others and they ALWAYS skimp on portions. You never know what you're gonna get as far as freshness and flavor goes. I have gone to the Elliot and Dobson one, many a times, just to avoid this Filiberto's and I live in walking distance! I always tell myself never to come back but I must say I am guilty But only after a late night of working and don't feel like driving far and getting out of my car. I really shouldn't be surprised...

***Da Bafroom: I have only been inside this location once, a long time ago, and did not visit the bathroom. Shame on me, yes I know! But being that it's one of the newest Fili-B's, I would imagine it being a fairly clean and ordinary bathroom. May need to make one more stop someday to update this portion of my review. To be continued..."}
{"text":"I was happy when they opened the Tolleson location, no need to drive into Phoenix , their food was great, not sure what happened , yet the past couple years their service has slowly declined and they raised their prices. Today was a what the hell moment, i ordered two green chili burritos, they tasted like dish soap, i couldn't even eat it, my dads California burrito was cold and the meat was tough, i took them back and the casher was happy to give me the money back, he barked at the cooks in how bad the food tasted and i could see them with a shitty grin, yucking it up. never again will i buy my food there."}
{"text":"I can't believe I just paid 11 bucks for a carne asada quesadilla and small coke. 

It was good, but I just can't believe I paid 11 bucks. 
No, I wasn't drink , I was just craving carne. *Buuuurp*"}
{"text":"Great for fast, good tasting Mexican food. Bean and cheese burrito or super nachos are great."}
{"text":"Ugh, I feel so bad. Me and this Filiberto's location used to have a good thing going on, but something has changed. For the worse. The only thing I can imagine is they have changed their bean supplier. Ever since September 2014 when I order my usual bean and cheese burrito, half the time the beans aren't cooked all the way so you get grey-ish-slop colored beans, with a dry or sandy texture, and an old-water taste. Or you get what I got last night, which were runny, grey-ish-slop that tasted more like day old oatmeal with a hint of rubber. It's so gross. 

Please fix your beans and call me! Otherwise, you have lost a devoted customer."}
{"text":"Our lazy asses did not cook this Friday night, so we decided to Filibertos it!  We always call in our order (they need a cc # if the order is over $10).  It was 15 to 20 mins. we show up at the place for pick up.  They forgot to make our order.  They apologized and offered us free drinks.  We declined the free drinks but they offered again.  We declined and they told us the order will be done in a few mins.  They apologized again when we got our order.  

Rolled tacos with cheese - Crunchy yumminess
Sausage breakfast burritos - Hello breakfast at 8pm 
Pollo Carne burrito - Love the chicken 
Combos meals
Yum yum yum to all! 

Plus...24 hours and drive thur."}
{"text":"This by far has to be the best Filiberto's location. I have been to the Phoenix, Tempe, Chandler, Prescott, Mesa, Gilbert, Tucson and Casa Grande locations. 

-Clean salsa bar with chunky and smooth salsa options.
-Free chips, most places will charge you for a small order.
-Gold Peak green tea!
-Smoothies and juices
-Video games, tv's and free wifi
-Fruit filled churros 

The tortillas are fresh and the place was actually clean, shocking. For what it is, this is a good location to stop by at if you are in the mood for this type of mexican food."}
{"text":"I like going here for the tv blaring spanish channels loudly. Then you get the food and it is okay for a mexican chain fast food restaurant. I like that it is next door to the bowling alley."}
{"text":"The first time I ever ate at a Filiberto's was at this location. I was a little hesitant and my girlfriend ordered for me because she's hispanic and has more knowledge about what is good. We got two tacos and a taco salad and it ended up costing like $25. Afterwards I thought it was weird that it cost that much and looked up the prices. What we ordered cost more like $14-16. 

The workers here overcharge you because they don't even speak english. It's kind of sad because I've been to a couple in the ghetto of phoenix and they were delicious and the workers are awesome over there. Avoid this location though. Go to the one on 83rd or on grand if you live in surprise."}
{"text":"Our family loves this place. Tuesday night is \"kids eat free\"...so that helps too. Every item that we have tried has been excellent. My mom and dad usually get the bbq platter which includes ribs, chicken and brisket. Almost every time we go they get that meal and split it. I had the Cobb salad (without black olives) last night and it didnt disappoint. I would highly recommend trying this place out. They have a rather large menu too."}
{"text":"This is what you eat when you're a baller on a budget. Carne Asada fries are the best! I don't even like cinnamon but I always get a large horchata drink because it is so ridiculously refreshing! Churros are always going to be a treat and the food is never cold or tastes like it's been sitting under a heat lamp. It's such a great price and better than any taco bell, Chipotle or pancheros. I love that some of these locations are 24 hours! Overall, great!"}
{"text":"Ok, so Filiberto's is my kinda joint.  It's open 24 hours and has tasty, inexpensive food.  It reminds me a lot of my favorite Mexican joint in Vegas, Roberto's.  I stopped in at a lil after 11pm the other night and got a Chicken Chimichanga.  I played some old school Pacman while I waited a very short time for it and when I got it, it was delicious.  I loved how the chicken was well seasoned and had a lil spiciness to it. :)  The beans and rice were also good.  I'll definitely be back.  

See ya there!"}
{"text":"The food is ehh. Only good when drunk really. My main issue is that the night crew, especially Friday and Saturday night, are the greediest people ever. Their card reader almost always conveniently goes down. Given the fact that I live right next to it, I often attempt to stop after a night of drinking with hopes that things will be different. No luck. They take an hour to make a burrito, and that's if I have cash on me. They pocket the money, it's a common practice, but I've never seen it done so often. Ask for a receipt, I guarantee they can't provide one."}
{"text":"So.... a friend and I order, to eat in and I request if there could be more fresh chips put out. Was TOLD, if you order fresh chips and pay, no problem, but to MAKE FRESH CHIP THAT ARE OUT FOR FREE, NO!??! WHY? Because 'she' didn't have time to make any, (counting ALL the patrons on 1hand). Wait! If I was to order and PAY for fresh chips @$1.20 versus NOT HAVING TIME TO MAKE A FRESH BATCH????? Strike 2... when there's a strike 3, you're OUT! TERRIBLE CUSTOMER SERVICE!"}
{"text":"My husband and i went there for dinner last night (drive thru). He got the Arizona and i got the pollo asada borritos .  Mine tasted like pork not chicken and had a lot of gristle. Overall not good!   My husband usually likes the Arizona but this time it was very greasy and bland.

It must be this location because we've eaten at others and they where just fine. 

We will just go to the one on southern from now on."}
{"text":"Filiberto's but not really. What?

They refused to accept a coupon that is clearly from their company because they \"dont.\"

No problem - I don't need to return to any location if this is the shady kind of business practices you offer. What a lame way to operate."}
{"text":"If you like burnt eggs in your burritos with a side of nasty smelling burnt eggs; this is the place to go. I'm not sure why they find it hard to cook eggs that are not burnt but every time I go there, they've accomplished it. I've learned my lesson and I no longer order from here. If you're going to make me wait in line for 25 minutes to get a burrito at least have the courtesy not to burn my eggs because along with burnt eggs, comes that stinky smell. Get a cook that knows how to make simple eggs that probably take less than 30 seconds to put on the grill and cook correctly."}
{"text":"Worst drive through experience in a good while. I went for a breakfast burrito early in the morning and I don't understand why the lady taking the orders at the drive thru was so rude. If you don't like your job, go somewhere else. And for you, stay away because apparently lots of others have had this experience as well. A place that is mismanaged to this level and makes it's customers experience this does not deserve business."}
{"text":"No matter what time you go. They take forever to make your order. I just turn off the car and lay back. This place also almost ALWAYS messes up your order. No matter how simple the order is, they can't achieve it. I always check my order now before I leave. When it's wrong I have to wait again for another 5mins just for someone to notice I'm still at the window. I even honked my horn but the employee just kept texting on his phone. The prices are ridiculous. Carne asada fries for $9.03 for the portion they give you is not worth it. Food smells odd too. This place just needs to be shut down."}
{"text":"This is a typical Filiberto's. I've never been inside of only been to the drive through a couple times I'm in town. But they have great customer service sales give you napkins in the drive-through and ask you what kind of hot sauce you want. Rolled tacos with guacamole and cheese is delightful. The burritos are always pretty solid. They also offer breakfast burritos."}
{"text":"Filibertos gives out coupons every Tim you buy some thing. However this location makes up dumb reasons or lies as to why you can't use them. I'm extremely disappointed And will never eat at this location again. Plus to top it all off the lady was rude and called me a liar. Such awful customer service. DONT make coupons if you refuse to let your customers use them!!!!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"If I could give this place zero stars I would. Service was awful but the food was worse. Taco shells were old and had barely any meat. Sauce was watered down. Not a fan."}
{"text":"Terrible. Unfriendly and not accommodating staff at all, despite explained my order multiple times they still took forever and got it wrong. Very disappointed and won't go back"}
{"text":"I recommend the Foie Gras with truffle butter emulsion paired with any '94 Chateau LaTour...

Oh wait, wrong place. Writing from memory, will update if I go back (aka surprisingly hungover & don't feel like microwaving breakfast). This is lard plain & simple, done pretty much the right way, usually tasty but with a kick an hour or two later. Cheap, big, & much better if you're either drunk or only have $10 in your bank account and need fatty burritos to last the whole day. Surprising that they're in the far reaches of Ahwatukee, so (probably unfairly) an extra star for that. Also a plus that they have a drive through so you don't have to get out of your car. Chorizo or bacon breakfast burritos do the trick & are surprisingly cheap. A little too dry in my opinion, but doesn't matter so much for me, I always put lots of hot sauce on mexican anyway. Self pity & questioning certain life decisions come free of charge."}
{"text":"Ordered rolled tacos and a Carne Asada burrito.... For a -berto restaurant, it's really not very good.  Tasteless, cold, and unimpressive."}
{"text":"HIGHLY RECOMMENDED:  Fili B's rocks!  Open 24/7 so whenever you've got the craving that only Filiberto's can fill. 

My review is rather limited, as I admit that I order the exact same menu item EVER single visit. I hear they have other delicious menu items although I'd never know. 

I order the carnitas burrito and it is delicious. Starting with the fresh tortilla...  It's perfect. Warm, fresh and very tasty...  It only gets better from here. The pork is succulent and perfectly caramelized perfection. They've added fresh guacamole and pico de gallo that add an additional explosion to your impatiently waiting tastebuds. Top this off with their salsa bar and pickled carrots and you've got one of the best burritos in the Valley!

They have 8 valley locations and offer weekday specials."}
{"text":"Usually hit or miss. Today I ordered cheese enchiladas and the cheese in them wasn't melted. It was cold shredded cheddar."}
{"text":"This place sucks. I ordered the two enchilada combo and they used shredded cheese for the inside cheese. Also the cashier did not know what refried beans were.  How do you work at a restaurant and not know your menu?  Very poor service. My first and last time there."}
{"text":"Great place, always has helpful employees and consistently good food. The night crew does great!"}
{"text":"I often eat at many of the filbertos in the valley but we all know that some are good and some are bad. This one is good along with the one on 19th ave and Thunderbird and 19th ave and Bell Rd. But i was  at a bar  in this area of town over the weekend and this place made up one of the best breakfast burritos I have ever had.  God dam, ill be back when Im in the area. Thanks Bertos!"}
{"text":"This Fili B's location is really new and very clean.  We stopped in on Taco Tuesday, obviously a very popular night because most of the tables in the restaurant were full.  You can't beat a $.99 taco!  I love their bean burritos because the tortillas are nice and soft and the beans are runny and delicious.  I love the choices of salsa on the salsa bar.  On taco Tuesday, my hubby and I ate for only $10, so that's pretty awesome."}
{"text":"The pico de gallo salsa was old,  old tomatoes. The carnitas was dry,  the beans and rice at the bottom  of my bowl was cold from the juice of salsa.  The chicken rolled tacos had absolutely no flavor.  Very disappointed,  took about 10 minutes for food but it looks like it took them 2 minutes to make."}
{"text":"Everyone deserves a second chance but this place was worse then before the location was filthy and the girl at the window extremely rude and unpleasant, And the food made me extremely sick. Never going back Waste of my money the only reason I gave it any stars was because yelp forced me I would have gave it negative if possible"}
{"text":"Edible, but not enjoyable.

Ingredients not fresh at all.

Drive through for some reason packed?! Don't get why. Just go to Taco Bell!"}
{"text":"First timer, found on Yelp. I wanted hard she'll tacos, had beef. Pretty good. I would not order the chips and salsa. The chips were burnt and the salsa was slushy."}
{"text":"They NEVER and I mean EVER get it right. I have to always check my orders because something is always wrong. I had it today though. Last time I ate here, I was on a budget and ordered 4 bean burrito kids meals. How do you get that wrong? I came home with 1 bean burrito kids meal and 3 quesadilla kids meal. Really?! Today as I was pouring horchata in my daughter's sippy cup, I found a dead fly as I was pouring! I immediately called and let them know but that was the last straw for me. That's it, never going back."}
{"text":"This location is great! I've eaten at several Filiberto's locations over the years and while they have all been good, the Anthem location tops them all. Excellent food, friendly service, delivery is great and Ronnie who we run in to from time to time is amazing! Friendly guy who makes sure your order is made right every time! This is our go to spot in Anthem."}
{"text":"When you want good Mexican, this is the place. Great location to be happy about loading a Mexican brick in your belly."}
{"text":"Such a disappointment! I ordered my Fav-a carne asada burrito w/ cheese, sour cream & bacon. I know crazy!! I paid $9 for a burrito! Usually it's not that much at the other locations. So when I opened the bag of disappointment & saw the smallest burrito ever, well that left me sad. But the party just began cuz the taste of the ingredients topped off the dismal feeling put forth by this location makes me sad to say this location blows"}
{"text":"This place is my jam! I've been coming here a while.... I've always gotten good quality food & my crazy orders always come out right. The horchata here is my fav-not too much cinnamon. The quantity is always plenty. I've realized I get a lot more here for my $$$ then I do at other locations... I'll continue to make a guest appearance here from time to time. no autographs tho.... well, some exceptions can be made"}
{"text":"I'd like to give a couple stars for the quality of the food but it's hard to judge the quality when they can't get your meal right....

This location is super busy & it looks relatively clean, that's about as far as I want to dig into it..... You ever get that feeling like your not wanted- well thats the impression I got from the lady at the counter. Felt like I was bothering her with my presence. Ordered a beef chimichanga and she confirmed my chicken chimi order so I had to specify beef. Ordered a couple rolled taco meals & sum hard tacos-all with rice & beans. With every item she asked \"is that it\" NO, we would like to continue ordering if possible..... read back the order and somehow we had a chicken chimi at the top of the list. had to revise that for a 3rd time. We specified rice & beans with all the meals. \"OK, in come with it\" A couple minutes later we received our order and good thing we did a quality check. Only the Chimi had rice & beans..... So of course we went back up to the counter and the lady then said-\"you want a side of rice & beans? That will cost you.....\" REALLY??? We asked for rice & beans with every meal. Promised we would get rice & beans, got our order NO RICE & BEANS! Now we have to pay for it. 

I like a Filiberto meal every once in a while but this place JUST PLAIN SUCKS! You know what else, I showed the lady my phone with my whopping $.50 YELP discount and of course she blew me off and didn't apply it. Why offer a cheesy .50 discount if your not going to honor it. It's only .50 but the snowball effect of their epic customer service entitles me to cry a little about everything."}
{"text":"Definitely a real Filibertos. The food was pretty good; what I expect when I go to any Filibertos location. I got the chicken tacos (as I usually do), and they were pretty good. I will say, though, that I had some pretty nasty, kind of painful indigestion the next day... so I'm not sure what to think of that. Could be because I haven't been eating much processed food lately. Careful, though."}
{"text":"Awful service! Nasty food! Got a chicken burrito it was very greasy and expensive. They also charge for jalapeños  $1 ...the cashier was very rude and the place has a sewer smell to it. Do not recommend it at all. However there is a lunch truck a few blocks down 91st and Grand they have great service for $5 !!"}
{"text":"THE WORST MEXICAN FOOD I HAVE EVER HAD IN MY ENTIRE LIFE. I don't eat beef and I ordered a chicken burrito, when I confront the lady she says \"oh I heard carne asada\" and stares at me as if my mind is going to change. Then, I tell her \"no, I ordered chicken\" & she says \"oh, well it's already made take it\". WHAT THE HELL. Eventually got another burrito and it was chicken but it was the most disgusting burrito I've ever had and I've had frozen burritos that are on an exquisite level compared to this place. DONT DO IT. DONT. YOU. DO. IT."}
{"text":"Be careful this place may be stealing your credit card information. I went there and next thing I know I get messages about fraud on my account. Be careful."}
{"text":"I've been to lots of filibertos locations all over Arizona but this one is by far the best. Service wasn't amazing but who cares?? They have the best pollo asada burritos ever, so it's only a minor inconvenience. Oh and the horchata  and even if the recipe is the same throughout all the filly-b's, I know that somethings different here. Maybe they just make it with love. Either way, I refuse to go to a filibertos that isn't this one. Keep up the great work."}
{"text":"Unspectacular. 

The service was extremely slow considering I was the only customer in the afternoon and all I ordered was a burrito. 
The place itself is pretty filthy, and the construction around the entire area makes it even tougher to get here. 

I would have to be pretty drunk the next time I come in"}
{"text":"First time here. And, based on the other reviews that I read, it seems that some dishes are better than others. 

For me, and other than a miscommunication (I ordered a BEEF Tostada, and got a BEAN one, instead. At least, I was charged for the BEAN), and while the beans could have been hotter, I found the Bean Tostada to be quite tasty. The tostada was warm and crisp, the beans warm, the shredded lettuce crisp, and the cheese was pretty fresh though it didn't melt since the beans weren't hot enough.

The place was clean. And, the staff was polite and efficient."}
{"text":"I have been a customer of this filibertos for years, and it disappoints me to say that I will never ever return to this establishment. I have worked in the food industry for years and I have never seen such bad customer service. I would give this place -5 five stars if I could! I would never advise anyone to go to this place. P.S I hate you stupid cashier with bad eyebrows"}
{"text":"HORRIBLE customer service. First time coming here and there was no line. The girl in the register was counting her cash. We were waiting right in front of her for a good 3 minutes and she looked up twice while counting her cash. She finally asked if we were ready. Really? It took that long for her to ask? The rest of the staff didn't look happy to be there and the girl taking orders through drive through was just sitting around. What a waste of my $11. They need  new set of staff. First and last visit"}
{"text":"Came here late a night when me and some some friends needed to get our grub on. The food was greasy and and although it didn't taste bad, it's was not worth writing home about. 

Better than most late night options in my opinion."}
{"text":"The most bland breakfast burritos we have ever had. The burritos were so gross hey had ZERO flavor. We will not be going back. Also it was priced way higher than other Locations. The trash can smelled better than the food. Would not recommend this restaurant. They charged $1.50 for the small size of pico de gallo that was almost flavorless, mostly just diced onions."}
{"text":"First time to this Filiberto's and really liked.  I thought their prices were reasonable and the lady at the counter was really nice.  Had rolled tacos with Guacamole really good and the store was clean inside.  

Their red hot sauce was better then other Filberto's I have been to as it was slightly hot and flavorful."}
{"text":"I love their bean and rice burritos! The staff is always very friendly and the food is great! Also they don't use lard in their beans which is great for vegheads! The rice is also veghead approved! No chicken stock!"}
{"text":"The worst experience I have ever eaten. Been here few times and keep giving them a chance to make my meal experience better but after I come back here, I regret giving a chance and wasted my money and time for a food that doest even know how to cook a simple breakfast burrito.

 my bf and I went and order there breakfast burrito (steak,egg,and potato) it was the tasteless food I have ever eaten. No flavor at all. I had to put alot of hot sauce and lots of ketchup just to add flavor to my food. The food was horrible... 

Don't ever come to this filiberto!! You would regret it...."}
{"text":"I am not proud to admit this, but I always feel nasty after eating here. Don't get me wrong the place is kept clean, the staff looks presentable,  but my food is always so greasy! It's fast 'Amerexican' (American + Mexican) food at its best. Order the carne asada burrito with guac and sour cream and you'll be set for awhile on your 'Amerexican' fix. 

Stop by their salsa bar too and pick up some red sauce - it's probably the only reason I come here once in a blue moon."}
{"text":"Tell me why they put a whole ass carne in my torta. That meat was mad tough and flavorless. Should have ate fresh at subway"}
{"text":"Read back order yet still got it wrong. Came home missing a burrito tried to call and get it settled and both the drive thru girl and whatever fake manager they had were rude and accusatory. For food that's subpar and awful service I'd rather spend my money elsewhere."}
{"text":"I was so bummed this place turned out to be such a let down... I work in the area and love Mexican food but this place couldn't even get the beans right... My tostada shell was stale and the beans came straight out of a can... & the hot sauce.. they need to revamp their recipe because even Taco bell has them beat."}
{"text":"I really like the Steak breakfast burrito the best. Their 24 hour drive through is a plus too especially for someone who work night shift"}
{"text":"Pretty good mexican grub in the 480.

I had two carne asada tacos and a chile rellano plate.

The meat in the tacos was tender, tasty and plentiful, accompanied by chilantro, onion and hot sauce - typical ingredients but done right.

The chile rellano had a flavorful red sauce, the batter was not too soggy, the chile was cooked well (not crunchy/underdone, not squishy/overcooked) and the cheese oozed out when the chile was cut into.  This dish came with the standard rice and beans, neither of which was remarkable in any way shape or form.

Minus two big stars for what they consider guacamole.  It wasn't thick, it had no taste and it seemed as though this vital mexican staple was merely there as a garnish.  No bueno.  If it ain't green, thick and tasty, you better hit the drawing board.

Ya feel me?"}
{"text":"I went there once..they dont even put cheese on burritos without charging extra.   They were just featured on dirty dining for having 4 major health code violations!!Eeeew!!"}
{"text":"I like Filiberto's-especially for breakfast.  First of all, the hours of business are awesome.  I don't even remember a time I went to Filiberto's and they were closed.  That's a good thing especially if you are coming home from a late night concert or movie and your stomach is telling you, \"Feed me...\"

My normal order for a quick weekend breakfast is the machaca burrito.  The thing is a good size to cut in half and feed two people.  My bf and I always share one breakfast burrito = $6.00 ($3/pp).  

Can't beat that! And...no dishes to clean up after."}
{"text":"Located just off the 101, I drop in here for lunch and breakfast quite often.  The Queso Monterrey is awesome and addictive and when it comes to mind, I have to have it.  Below are a few menu items I've sampled.

They have a Salsa bar where you can select from a variety of different Salsa flavors....mild, med, spicy.  There's also freshly sliced Radish and Lemon avail as well.

There's plenty of seating in the restaurant, but it can get busy during the 12-1 pm lunch rush.  I usually go just before or after that time period.

{"text":"I normally love filibertos. I think that it is a staple of the Phoenix/Arizona diet. Of all the locations I've been to in my 16 years of living in Arizona this one has been the worst. The guy at the window managed to get my order wrong 3 times. When I did get the food, it had hair in it. Wear a hair net if you make food, it's not difficult. All while I was waiting in the heat. It wasn't busy and still took a while. I have fairly low standards for a dining experience which is why I was at filibertos and even then this place was lousy."}
{"text":"So disgusting worst place I EVER ATE IN Arizona I will never eat here again , I recommend for others to not eat here ever! Who in the right mind will eat here again . Horrible horrible horrible !!!! I wish I could've took a picture of my food before I just threw it away! 

I have to give this shit hole a star just to post my review , when really this place deserve ZERO STARS . 

DONT EAT HERE!!! Trust me! You'll regret it!!"}
{"text":"We ordered 4 chorizo breakfast burritos and 15 minutes later she wants hand us 3 potato & 1 chorizo burrito. NO!!!! We had to wait while they obviously had to make the correct order . No apologies or explanation of why we had to wait!!!! I'd give negative stars if it was an option. Total wait 40 minutes."}
{"text":"When anyone from Phoenix, or especially Tucson, considers a Mexican food joint ending in \"...berto's\" it is extremely easy to picture a place that is rather disgusting and probably about to get shut down.

Not so with Filiberto's. This PARTICULAR location breaks the stereotype of the abused and unclean fast Mexican food restaurant by actually being cleaner than most sit-down restaurants. I've been going here for quite some time now and this location is always spotless and the food is always excellent.

I never have to worry about getting sick when I go to this place. There are awards for their quality and cleanliness all over the walls. If you've been burned by other ____berto's places, give this one its rightful chance, you'll be getting what you were intended to.

Well done!"}
{"text":"Ok, so it's been some years since I've been to Tolleson. We were visiting a friend and normally we'd drive somewhere else for a quick bite to eat for our visit. But the main avenue was looking very friendly, with string lights on every tree and every pole up and down the road. We decided to try out Filibertos for a quick bite. Best surprise: good quantity of food for the price. The $5 menu is great. I got the fish taco, rice, beans combo w 22 oz drink, for $5!  I'm thinking, ok, it will be a smaller taco but nope, it was two full size corn tortillas with a good size fish portion and cole slaw. Very tasty and filling. My friend got the green chili burrito, and the size was not the gigantic burrito but it was a good size, with green sauce that had flavor with a kick.  Well done in the new friendlier looking neighborhood."}
{"text":"To start off this establishments drive through speaker wasn't even functioning,so it was very hard to communicate my order, second of all the associate taking my order didn't respond to the way I wanted my meal prepared when I asked for a small amount of chicken and completely disregarded what I was saying, and then when I got home the burritos were leaking from out the bag and I could hardly pick mine up, it wasn't edible and I payed almost 20 dollars for 2 burritos, when I tried to call about the situation, their number was disconnected and I could not reach them so here I am writing this review don't go here."}
{"text":"Went here last week with a friend and it will definitely be the last. My friend and I both got sick within 30 minutes of eating. I got a burrito with shrimp. The shrimp wasn't cooked all the way. The food was drenched in MSG, a flavor enhancer with a long list of side effects. I don't know what it was about the food, but after I ate it I went to bed and I suddenly forced myself out bed as my lungs were tightening up and struggling to breathe. I started to weeze when I breathed in. I got a bad headache. My nose was running. I was sneezing and coughing. It was awful. I was close to going to the hospital. I ended up taking a bunch of vitamins and other natural medicine to fight whatever happened to me. FOOD POISONING? IDK but luckily it went away after the meds kicked in. I have a feeling it was a combination of uncooked food of low quality cooked in unsanitary conditions but who knows. After reading other reviews it seems this is a good place to eat if you want to get sick. BE CAREFUL!!! EAT AT YOUR OWN RISK!!! 
   My syptoms were signs of food poisoning. Look it up. Plus my friend got sick too and we never get sick. The only conclusion  is bad food. Something is going on at this location. Read other reviews, there are many more who said the same thing."}
{"text":"This location has gone downhill quickly.  After jacking up their prices substantially a few months ago, they apparently decided at the same time to just do away with service.

Cruised up to the drive through at 5:30 PM yesterday (a Saturday) and the place was deserted.  I've noticed in recent months there are rarely cars in the parking lot and almost never any cars in the drive through when I drive by... makes you wonder how much longer this location will be in business, but after my experience yesterday, I can certainly see why people are avoiding this place.

I ordered a half order of super nachos with shredded chicken and a bean burrito with cheese and onions.  I was charged an extra 50 cents for the onions and the drive through person repeated the entire order over the loudspeaker correctly (even though I had to repeat it three times for some reason).  The receipt also showed the order exactly as I had indicated.  

Instead of super nachos with shredded chicken, I got super nachos with carne asada.  My bean and cheese burrito came with NO onions.  Even though I paid 50 cents extra for them.  Both parts of my order were incorrect.  How hard is it when there are no other customers, inside or in the drive through, to get the order right for one person?  In addition, I was made to wait about 5 minutes at the drive through window after ordering before I was even acknowledged. 

I might (MIGHT) have given a pass had this been the first time, but the exact same thing happened a few months ago with the nachos. They gave me carne asada instead of shredded chicken. They simply don't care.  And their prices are no longer affordable for the quality of food you get.  Go to one of the dozens of other establishments that serve varieties of Mexican food in the area.  This one doesn't earn your business."}
{"text":"Had the meatiest, unbelievably stuffed beef burrito ever here. Cheap too, although it was kind of greasy. Still good though, A-OK!"}
{"text":"Just got food and they almost gave my order away to the people in front of me. Sat in line for at least 15 minutes. Ordered a large coke and they never gave it to me. Never coming back to this location again."}
{"text":"Super nice staff, but Filiberto's what the heck happened to your pricing? Just wow. Wish I had taken my kid to a restaurant instead ~ as in an ambiance that matches the price of what I'm paying for. Ouch :'("}
{"text":"Remember folks, this is FAST FOOD Mexican. This location is closest to my house so I go here quite a bit.  The taco Tuesday taco's are darn good for $1.29 and so are the Wednesday bean Burritos.  If you are not ordering off the special menu, I find the food to be reliably good.  They never mess up the order and are generous with the hot sauce.  The service is quick and this location is very clean."}
{"text":"I used to eat here all the time and loved it. This location does not taste the same as other locations. Their red sauce is inedible and so is their chicken burrito that is cooked in the red sauce. It has a strange soapy like flavor. It will also make you sick! The flavors changed about a year ago and have stayed consistently bad. The Tempe location still tastes amazing."}
{"text":"I would think a supreme quesadilla actually comes with sour cream and guacamole like it says on the menu or at least some pico, but not this one. Guess they forgot. Too expensive for cheese meat and tortilla. That was pretty disappointing. I guess it tasted ok though. Step it up Filibertos or we will find a new taco shop."}
{"text":"If you've been to the other *bertos, you've seen the same menu.  I've been to this location about 15 times.  The burritos are huge and the food is always hot.  The drive-thru can be a little slow, but that is expected with made-to-order food.  I've never had an issue with accuracy, even with late-night and early-morning orders."}
{"text":"Filibertos is perfect for anytime or any hour of the night!!! Love their food!! My favorite choice is the chicken enchiladas!!"}
{"text":"Great place for drunk munchies or whenever you are craving late night Mexican food. But it's not really the go to place for Mexican food in general. I came here once for breakfast burrito and the whole burrito smelled like oil. And it's really not quality food. 
I'm not hating though because when it's 3am on a weekend night and you want some fried Mexican food, this place delivers (not literally)"}
{"text":"this filiberto's is clean, newer, and serves up some quality mexican food. i like the breakfast burritos, especially the steak and egg, at any time of day (or night). hot sauce isn't watered down. the rice is super good. staffers are pretty friendly here too. solid location that doesn't smell. 4 stars."}
{"text":"I was very happy when I arrived at Filibertos. I have not had a great tasting carne asada burrito for quite awhile. I could not eat inside so I ordered to go instead for it smelled like a nasty locker room. I only live a minute away and was so eager to eat my burrito, but it turned out to be cold and though I might get food poisoning or diarrhea."}
{"text":"Nice new location same great tasty food, The always make the food a soon as I order it so its always fresh, I can always count on a great fulfilling burrito, ADOBADA AND CHILE RELLENO are my favs"}
{"text":"I like this restaurant, I always have to delicious burrito or whatever i may get to satisfy my taste buds . Friendly service and I nice place to stay and eat"}
{"text":"This offers great tasting food and the convenience of a drive through and never  a long wait, And you can eat your food in the big parking lot and have the  Circle K to go the bathroom"}
{"text":"Don't not eat here they hack your bank, they need to fix this and the food was gross the service was horrible you have better luck somewhere else"}
{"text":"I love Filibertos but wont gobhere again! I love a good burrito gut buster but added non food items could be downright dangerous!"}
{"text":"Grooooosssss!!!  I got a COCKROACH in my food!!!  I went through drive through and started nibbling on my quesadilla and there it was.  Definitely reporting it to the health dept.  How dirty can the place be to have a cockroach IN the food and go unnoticed?"}
{"text":"Ugh. Only place around this morning to get a breakfast burrito because Viva was closed. There were eggshells all throughout both of our burritos. Seriously?! I threw mine away. And I will eat pretty much anything"}
{"text":"Went to Fili-b's last night to get some sweet, delicious rolled tacos. Rolled up and saw that they had a special going on: $1.19 for 3 rolled tacos with cheese, SCORE! Grabbed 6 rolled tacos with cheese and got guac on the side (charged me $4 for additional guac so did I really benefit from the special?). Here's the kicker: within 30-45 minutes of eating my scrumptious, beautiful rolled tacos, my stomach felt uneasy and I promptly threw up everything I had eaten that day. Thanks Filibertos.

TL;DR their rolled tacos literally made me vomit -- go somewhere else"}
{"text":"Menudo is a rip off,a bowl of broth & hominy is all you get,at $8,95 I expect allot more,very disappointed"}
{"text":"...It's okay. I went with my boyfriend between 3-4 AM (gotta love working nights!). The staff was super nice and the food was ready quickly. Tasty horchata. I got the cheese enchiladas and am wondering if they used a whole bag of salt or slightly less."}
{"text":"4 min for a drive through burrito makes for 5 stars!!!!!!

**I recommend NOT driving away from the pay window drive through even when there is a car behind you, because that will result in you walking in and embarrassing yourself....
^^^Not that that happened to me...Speaking for a friend.

In all seriousness, this place is 24h drive through, SO fast, and their carne asada burrito ($7) is more than just decent!!! (I speak as someone from Socal). Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"This is my favorite Fili B's.  We often pick up breakfast burritos and are able to feed our whole department with just a few of them because they're HUGE.  Need something for a pot luck at work?  I walked in and ordered 50 rolled tacos on the spot.  10 minutes later they had it bagged up, hot and ready to go with LOTS of guac, cheese and their delicious green salsa. They didn't take a pre-order at all because they wanted it to be fresh.
 This place is a regular stop for all of us and we've never been disappointed."}
{"text":"Ok, I gave them another chance after my last review in March. They have always been fair with their portions up til recently. They either changed cooks, or have purposely cut portions. I again order the #3 Taco dinner. When he handed it to me I could tell by the weight of it that there was an issue. Waited to get home. There was barely any meat on the taco's and still they cut down the rice and bean amount. That was more tolerable thank skimping on the meat in the taco. I wish I could attach a picture. After many years of going here I am not happy at all these past two times. They may have lost a loyal customer. I may say 3 strikes and your out in order to see if they fix this problem. Also, this dinner has no onions in it and they got some onions in it, which I hate. What is going on Filiberto's Southern Ave?!?!?!?!"}
{"text":"Today I ate here and the beans were way too salty to eat and the rice was almost the same, but a little more tolerable. Wanted to send it back, but my husband insisted that I let it go. 

Also, one of the worker's had a child running around the restaurant ( about 5 years old), and he was touching everything ( silverware, napkins, toothpicks) it was horrible!! The child was climbing on the front counter and running back and forth and sliding on the floor. 

I may give the place another try in the future because I have had good food here in the past. Sorry Filiberto's :("}
{"text":"Went to this joint while passing through...how can you get Mexican food SOOOOO wrong?!?!  This place absolutely sucks...the place is huge but run-down...there is nothing authentic about this place...my kids and I absolutely hated this place...very, very, very disappointed...no wonder the place was absolutely empty...I think this place used to be a Carl's Jr., it has the same set up as the ones built in the 80's...I wish it was STILL a Carl's Jr., I would at least have had a decent meal...avoid this place at ALL costs..."}
{"text":"Thought we would try out Filaberto's for Taco Tuesday because of the reviews on here. I was not impressed! Maybe there are better items on their menu but for the 99 cent tacos I would much rather have Taco Bell. These tacos were not that good. The shells were extremely hard, I thought I was going to chip a tooth. The filling was tasty but when picking up to eat, there was a pool of grease on the plate. The hot sauce is in a big pot that you help yourself to, but was as runny as water. No more Filaberto's for me."}
{"text":"$5 for a bean and cheese burrito. AND it wasn't good! I was on the search for good Mexican fast food and this place is not it."}
{"text":"Every time I come here the portions are smaller than any other filibertos. I've been in Arizona 15 years and quantity was their prize to fame!   I did a test tonight.  I ordered an Arizona burrito from here,  then on the one on 35th and southern.  One in laveen,  (51st and Baseline) paper thin.  Southern... proper! I'll definitely be making the drive based on this!"}
{"text":"I ate hear for the first time since moving to Arizona.  I had a chorizo and egg burrito and it was extremely greasy.  But then again, chorizo burritos are not high on the list of low fat low carb options.  Considering it was 11pm I'm not going to complain.  Don't be upset if the drive through takes too long; they make food to order so it is going to take a bit longer than average fast food.  I also think it's always going to be a bit difficult to get that much variety that late at night.  My wife had two crunchy chicken tacos and they were well worth it."}
{"text":"so after driving around south phoenix for an hour on a sunday, in search of an open mexican dive joint to get a breakfast burrito, and extremely hungover and tired, i somehow ended up at fili b's.

they serve breakfast all day, which is quite an amazing thing.

i think that if i hadn't had spent so long searching for a joint that was open and starvingly had to stop here before hunger completely overwhelmed me, i would have just gone to a more familiar mexican drive-thru, like the one at 5th ave and camelback, or 40th st and indian - all which serve some pretty dank breakfast burritos.

but i ended up here, and the food was meh. it didn't really hit the spot like i was hoping it would have. too much cheese and the bacon wasn't cooked long enough and was fatty. my friends got chorizo burritos which were bland and extremely greasy. i usually try to avoid fili's and go to one of the sister/knockoff joints like rollbertos, eribertos, armandos, etc."}
{"text":"This is seriously the cleanest and most beautiful Filiberto's I've ever been in.  There's lots of room for dining in, and there's even a jukebox!  Food is excellent as always."}
{"text":"Best filibertos!! They have a lot more food than the other filibs. I always get the carne asada fries. The horchata is good too"}
{"text":"Love this place, never stingy. Always give good portions of everything. Best Filiberto's I've been to, and I've been to too many."}
{"text":"Great location! It good to see corporate office dweebs get a chance to try some decent Mexican fast food. Free chips and salsa are mue bueno and the food is consistent with their other locations. Can't go wrong with any of their menu items. 99 cent daily specials are cool."}
{"text":"The food was dry , I ordered 5 mini tacos and it was just carne Asada on tortillas .no pico de gallo or cilantro just meat . Ill never go there again"}
{"text":"Worst Filibertos I've ever gotten food from in 17 years. Intercom barely worked, and the employees seemed rushed. The burritos were much smaller than normal. We asked for extra cheese in the burritos and instead got a smaller than usual portion. The enchiladas had no sauce and again barely any cheese. I dumped red sauce all over my food as soon as I opened the container, took a bite, and spit it out. The sauce was either rancid, or mixed with something... nasty. Absolutely disgusting. We didn't eat any of it. I would have easily taken food from a road side stand in Juarez over this garbage."}
{"text":"Wow! This is a tough one...

This place smelled like shit.   No other way around it. Came in and all the tables where up and things were being cleaned. I wondered if maybe someone had an accident.

Still wanted a Arizona (California) Burrito so I hooked it up. There 2 red salsas are both kind of watery and to make it worse there was a fly constantly buzzin around my head. Still though.. I felt there should be. It was a great burrito. It was huge also. 

This place is kind of like the Mexicanization of a Americanization of a Taco Burrito place.  And I am happy with that..  The kind of place if I lived in the area I would probably come back to every week.

And they have Tamarindo Jarritos.. which i love!"}
{"text":"I usually enjoy coming here for some quick Mexican food but the last time I was here there were some faults 
The service was ok. Very brief didn't ask if I would like to add cheese or rice to my all meat carne asada burrito. Mind you i hadn't been to this restaurant in a while so I forgot to ask. But it would have been nice to have been reminded. 
Restaurant was quite dirty and the tables were mostly sticky, I had to choose multiple tables before I sat at a semi clean one. 
Wayyyy to much meat in my burrito would have really enjoyed cheese or sour cream"}
{"text":"Stood out side the window for almost 5 minutes. The cooks kept talking amongst themselves,  but wouldn't come to the window to help us. I made eye contact with one of the men several times and still no one came to the window. They lost out on our service , we left and went to a different location."}
{"text":"fili b's is strictly a late night post booze place-i would never go here during daylight hours. 

that being said, it's actually pretty good and a heck of a lot better than your other 24 hour drive through options. not once have i gotten sick, had a stomachache, or had \"use your imagination digestion issues\" like other people on here have complained about. and since it's one second from my house i've eaten here more times than i can count. no issues ever. 

i usually get the chile relleno, arizona burrito, or the country burrito. all are huge and can be easily split with your closest drinking buddy. and it's only proper to douse all the food in tons of red sauce (i always ask for extra and they happily comply) and to get a large horchata to complete the meal!"}
{"text":"Great location. The staff are personable and prompt. Burros are crispy and taste better than most lications. Would recommend for your hang over needs"}
{"text":"The food here is awesome! I got a combo meal that includes a burrito, taco, beans, and rice. The only bad thing was that it didn't come with a drink so I had to purchase it separately. Not counting the churro I purchased on top of that (for $1), my whole meal was $10. The restaurant itself was very clean. Even the bathroom appeared to be well taken care of. As far as the employees go, the ones I encountered were polite. The cashier was a little hard to understand because she spoke softly, but at least she got my order right."}
{"text":"When I arrive at Filbertos the woman that took my order scowled at me and took my order with a rude tone.  The food was delivered to me rudely. The food tasted bad and made me ill. One week later I went to a different location and the same server was there. Gosh what are the odds.  She treated me as rudely at this location as as the other. After one bit the food tasted the same and I threw it away.  I did not want to get sick like the first time.  I will never eat there again."}
{"text":"Customer service is non-existent here, but what can you really expect? The food is good, although they skimp when I add shrimp to my fajitas and get only 4 minis. My kids really like their fries and cheese quesadilla, and they are only .99 on Mondays. Its worth the drive to Tia Rosa or Tosinos up the street if you want better service."}
{"text":"I live in Cali now, but I miss the AZ burrito with sour cream! I haven't found any place over here that even comes close to Filibertos!"}
{"text":"Love the food.   My favorite is the carne Assad burrito.   Employees are never friendly.    Today the guy working drivethru was just weird.    My total was 10.13 and he refused to give me my change.    Usually I wouldn't care about 87 cents but it was weird.   He tried to say it was tax.   I showed him my receipt that tax was charged.      He reluctantly gave me my change and slammed the window.     I won't be going back for awhile."}
{"text":"When I first moved to Phoenix, I was told that I should never eat at a restaurant that ends in -berto's unless it's Filiberto's.  And, thankfully, sticking to that rule has always ensured that I didn't get sick from a bad burrito.

But it never prevented me from getting the wrong thing on a regular basis.  I order a beef, I get pork.  I order a burrito anticipating veggies, rice and meat, and get a brick-size amount of chicken cubes in a tortilla.  I order a drink and have to finangle to receive it.

Service sucks. This location's atmosphere is parking lot full of yuppy cars from the people going to Pita Jungle or getting vegan pizza.  But the food, regardless of how different from the actual or anticipated order, is always good."}
{"text":"This Filiberto's is BRAND NEW and pretty much the most amazing one out there. The staff are super friendly and patient. The deals are even better than I remember. PLUS this location has games and a chips and salsa bar, need I say more!!!  Very clean and they make it fresh!"}
{"text":"Still hasn't gotten any better. Drivethru wait time has gotten worse. Currently been sitting in the drive thru for 24 minutes trying to grab lunch..."}
{"text":"Very friendly service and good food. 

I had the fish tacos and they were piping hot and excellently crispy friedness.  The rice is decent and the beans are ok.  I really enjoyed the nice people that worked at the counter and got the food out."}
{"text":"I was headed for my love ranch brothel & Alien Cathouse outside vegas coming from Scottsdale when I realized Krissy Summers did not try Mexican food so when I saw Filibertos I pulled and ordered a machaca plate damn I love it !!! Also ordered her some taquitos with Gaucamole it is what it is quick good Mexican food"}
{"text":"I went here months ago and haven't returned. I purchased 3 bean burritos for the kids and myself, bought a few extra tortillas and 3 drinks. We pulled over in the parking lot to eat in the car. I was dispersing some of the beans in the burrito to one of the extra tortillas I bought, and I found a bug inside the burrito. I pulled it out and told the kids to stop eating. I had them examine it just to make sure I wasn't going crazy. 

I immediately drove back to the window and showed the cashier what I had found. She brought the cook over who insisted it was just a burnt piece of tortilla. 

I guess burnt pieces of tortilla also have wings and legs?

They failed to agree it was a bug but returned all of my $ to me. 

I have never been back and will never ever return to this Filibertos. Gross!!"}
{"text":"I love tacos. Especially on taco Tuesdays where the tacos are on special. They have other daily specials but my favorite is the tacos. Lol enough about tacos but I also like how they make the horchata from scratch. They are fast, friendly and good food!!"}
{"text":"I should have listened to the reviews. The food quality was terrible. The horchatas where made wrong and tasted like red hots and the food tasted off."}
{"text":"One Filibertos is like all the rest of them. The only difference is in the building itself and the employees. This one is fairly shady and looks old and dirty. Against my better judgement I have gotten food here a couple times and it wasn't great. The burritos were dripping with grease and the guacamole was bland and tasted like it was from the bottom of a jar. It is not in a good part of town so maybe that is why they don't keep up with the appearance or food. Nearby are much better choices for fast Mexican."}
{"text":"Heart burn and gas. That's what this place will give you! But if you're looking for cheap \"Mexican\" food this place is convent and centrally located."}
{"text":"I told my friend that I would treat her to whatever she wanted for dinner last night for her birthday& she said she wanted Filibertos. Was not expecting that, but sure, why not. I have only ever had breakfast burritos there so coming for dinner was new to me. I got the carne asada burrito & it was delicious. I think it was around $7 & then I ordered a side of sour cream for like $1, & the burrito was huge!! My friend ordered 2 tacos & a bean burrito, boy were we surprised at how much food that was. The tacos were $3 each and basically had like double the tortillas under them and were hugeeeeee. One of those could have been my meal. 

So glad I discovered that filibertos is also good for other meals, not just breakfast ;)"}
{"text":"I love coming here and ordering the undercooked carne asada fries. Seriously, every time I order them and don't ask them to make the fries crispy, then they are limp, soggy and only slightly warm. At almost $10 for an order, I would expect my food to be properly cooked. Guess my expectations are too high for this place."}
{"text":"Friendly service....terrible food. The most bland beef tacos and burritos I've ever had. I paid $24 for two lunch combos....way too much for what I got."}
{"text":"Went in, no greeting.  Stood there and were ignored by everyone there.  Two minutes.  The only people there.  Ignored.  We left"}
{"text":"I love that you are always there for me, all hours of the night, less than a mile from my home. I always get the bean and cheese burrito with extra cheese. I am no thrill seeker here. I really really dislike just about all Mexican food, but the bean and cheese stays close to my heart. I get bean and cheese burritos every time my husband drags me to one of these shady little Mexican establishments, and I would say that Filibertos does not do it best. This particular location is one of the biggest I have seen, but still a little too sketch for me to sit and eat there. Also, the drive thru takes FOREVER. Just run in - it will be much faster. Good burritos, and I will always be back for you, Filis!"}
{"text":"There is one thing this place does right and that is mess your order up every time. I order number 6 shrimp ranchero. Every other time it come with the tarter sauce. Last serval time they either forgot or one they says some crap like it does not come with it. Btw they need to learn customer service. I would love to see places like this go out of business. He manager on shift has a foulmouth."}
{"text":"I just recently moved into the area and I have been hearing about this Filibertos Mexican Food and how good it is... So being cautious I came onto yelp to check the reviews to see if they were good or not... Well I saw the reviews were not what I expected but my friends swore this place was good so I decided to check it out... All I want to say is I came I tried and I LOVED IT!!! The food there is fresh and really tasty and the people working there are extremely friendly!! I told them I was new to the area and they hooked me up with a free taco as a sample!! I just wanna say people who are having bad days or are just usually negative dont come onto yelp and write untrue useless reviews! I have nothing but good things to say about this place my suggestion to anyone that comes on here to look at these reviews dont take our words for it try it yourself I am sure you will be nothing but pleased with this location!!"}
{"text":"One star because I cannot give less.  The food here is greasy tasteless and some is super salty. Ordered shrimp tacos and they were covered in old wilted lettuce.  Exchanged for a bean burrito which was the worst excuse for beans covered in greasy strips of what looked like kraft singles. Overpriced too. Bathrooms were filthy with graffiti everywhere made the chevron bathroom look elegant. Run down place save your money and go elsewhere."}
{"text":"Carne Asada fries are decent but they overcharge. I asked for two beef tacos and they charge for the complete meal but only give the tacos. Plus the drive-thru is hella slow."}
{"text":"As far as fast Mexican food goes, here it is. EVERY time we are in AZ, we hit this joint up. Seriously, like three times in four days...the ladies at the counter were cool, the place was clean, salsa bar was rocking and stocked...all the good ingredients you need for a little 'hole in the wall' burrito spot. I don't think they make anything bad, but if you want to change your life for the better, get a carne asada burrito. They even have karaoke every night after 8pm. Totally kidding about that. I wanted to see if you were paying attention still. Use coupons and see what is on special each day."}
{"text":"Worst experience ever. I've been bed ridden with food poising for two days now. I will never return to a Filbertos again and have already warned everyone I can about this location. Not being able to even stomach water after 24 hours I was almost inclined to visit the ER."}
{"text":"My favorite Fili-B's location, and believe me I've been to them all. The interior is clean and the food is consistently good. Not thrilled with the chains recent price increase at every store, though. The convenience of the the drive thru and 24 hour availability keeps us coming back, but during regular business hours and when we're not in a rush you'll find us at Carolina's just down the street."}
{"text":"A coworker suggested rhis place because he swire the carne asada fries are to die for. And he was right. This a fast food chain, so they are everywhere. I paid almost $10.However, its enough for upto three people. Check it out."}
{"text":"This is the location that made me decide to boycott all of their locations forever.  I drive past them and go to their competitors, even though it's several miles away.  When this location first opened they had this man-hater in the  drive-through with a bad attitude. She'd never returned a hello, never respond to a thank you,  always rolled her eyes when I ordered, and constantly gave me the opposite color salsa that I'd ask for.  When I contacted the corporate office I heard nothing back."}
{"text":"I've been eating at this same Filiberto's for over 10 years. It's always fast, always delicious, and always cheap. It's the perfect late night drunk food or something quick and high quality than Taco Bell in the middle of the day. 
I always get three rolled tacos with cheese and sour creme with a side 1/2 pint of \"Mexican-style\" rice. Since last time I've been here - a few years - their oil changed and it tastes a little different but was still awesome."}
{"text":"One of my favourite fast-food stops in Arizona. Don't come here expecting normal levels of customer service or speed, but come here for the food. Wonderful Sonoran-style cheese-covered saucy food. All the one-star reviews here are focusing on the wrong thing - they should have gone to Taco Bell."}
{"text":"Rolled tacos, Cali or AZ burrito and a horchata is all you need. I still prefer this place over most Mexican restaurants. Drive thru is a bit slow but you know they are making it right"}
{"text":"I generally avoid Filiberto's unless I've run out of other options, and even then I stick to one or two things on the menu.  They can't mess up a basic breakfast burrito with eggs, potatoes and cheese.  Well, I say that and the potatoes are always undercooked so they're crunchy from the rawness.  They make a decent AZ burrito, but it's greasy as all get out--you'll want to pour out the grease before consuming the last bit of the burrito.  

Because it's so close to the house, I've been here at least 30 times, so I have a fully-formed opinion.  I used to be excited about them when they first opened--who wouldn't be excited about 24-hour Mexican right on your corner?  Over the years I've become turned-off by their cheap meats, overly greasy food, and inability to cook potatoes.  

A better option for a cheap burrito in the area would be Los Favoritos in Chandler or Some Burros."}
{"text":"Fili B's is the go-to in Phoenix! You won't find a better Mexican drive thru. It's even better when you've got a craving for Mexican food and it's after midnight. The nachos are amazing, the breakfast burritos are FILLED with perfection, and the 2am craving for rolled tacos are on point satisfaction. DEFINITELY recommend Fili B's to everyone looking for a quick, real Mexican, bite to eat!"}
{"text":"Just got home from Filiberto's so ready to eat my corner asada fries and Road tacos. I just love coming throughout the week because of all the specials."}
{"text":"I used to go the this restaurant, when it was a Moe's.  Moe's went out of business, and Filiberto's does what Filiberto's does.   It took over a defunct restaurant, and started selling cheap Mexican food there.  I had never eaten at a Filiberto's, or any other 'berto's in the Valley, so I begged my lunch group to go there.  Entering the restaurant, it had a rotting seafood smell.  I don't know what it was from, but it detrimental to the experience.  I ordered the red chili burro, it is my benchmark food for Mexican restaurants.  The red chili was chewy, under cooked, and lacking in flavor.  My other lunch mates did not have any better experience than I did.  This place is a definite \"NO !!!\" in my book, and in the minds of the other members of my lunch group.  

There are other restaurants at that strip mall.  If you find yourself there, do yourself a favor, go to Pizza Roma, or Haiku Grill, or Sami's Gyros, or Port of Subs.  They are all superior to really bad Mexican at Filiberto's."}
{"text":"I am a fan of taco stands in general, but....
This location consistently ruins my beloved bacon, potato, egg and cheese breakfast burrito.  Every now and then they get it just right, but most of the time there's something missing from it.  The bacon is frequently burned to a crisp, and the eggs...OH the poor eggs.  They are browned beyond all recognition and sometimes just a thin layer of bubbly burned stuff."}
{"text":"Got confused and thought this place was Julioberto's. Ended up ordering a carne asada taco and a fish taco anyway. It tasted good going down but 1 hour later and my stomach is hurting OD and I have the chills. Pretty sure I am going to vomit soon."}
{"text":"Rude people working here, when you pull up to the drive thru you literally have to say \"hello\" or you'll never get asked what you need! Once you pull up to the window they want to charge extra for things that should already come in the combo?? Scam like place and rude ask people working here!"}
{"text":"As there are a lot of Mexican restaurants to choose from I'm going to give it one more chance. Did drive-through took 15 minutes to get a simple burrito at 11 o'clock on a Saturday morning when you get the burrito home it's not like it used to be it's a third of the size. Disappointed for sure I'd give it one and a half stars if I could. Or just drive down the street to the other Mexican restaurant"}
{"text":"This place is by far the best place in the area.....not only is it \"good for buckeye\" it's a great place for anywhere......the decor is modern yet warm and inviting they have a couple dozen big screens a great sound system nice stone work and a hard wood floor....the  food is first rate if you know filibertos Mexican food....forget it .....the menu is completely different ...I had an amazing burger my wife had the cob salad that she loved....the app was steak skewers with mango salsa....very very good...it's bar food elevated...The place beat every expectation i had and i cant what to try everything on the menu. These  people have put a lot  of work into this place from the decor to the menu and it shows....I'm an instant regular...oh I have never commented on yelp before but I just had to for this place........"}
{"text":"This place is terrible. The beef must have been pink slime. Go to Nando's across the street. They are not fast food but much better quality."}
{"text":"Love this location, my wife and I eat here twice a week sometimes and it's good every time."}
{"text":"Best FiliBs....excellent menu variety, huge portions, quality food items, friendly customer service"}
{"text":"Fili-B's ? 

How about Fili- No . . . 

Okay, that didn't even make sense. But here's my review of the infamous Filiberto's located on Broadway. Inside is clean.. the drive through can be very busy at times .

In my own personal opinion, each Filiberto's stands out from one another. For example this Broadway location is especially different from my home Chandler location. The sizing of the portions are larger, but contain a distinctive greasier taste. There's a lot of seasoning. I'm not sure if this is just something that happens at this location, but it feels like the Filiberto effect is largely at Play specifically here.

One thing I can't fathom is how carne asada fries are ridiculously overpriced. $9.79? Take the fries, which normally cost $4.69, throw in some carne asada meat some guacamole cheese and sour cream and upcharge it nearly 120%!? 

Classic commercialization on familiarise, vapid flavors in an upended system...but I digress. 
 
Small tip! They have big salsa cups here! Compared to the measley, tiny cups offered at other Tempe locations. 

Customer service here is great. . . They were friendly and served up with a \"smile\". Emphasis on the quotations. 

Hey it's Filiberto's, what else can you expect . 

Horchata was very watery. . Not too authentic,  but not bad either.  

I prefer Vaquero's ... few miles away on Southern! 

Burritos and tacos are a safe bet. Flautas and rolled tacos are extremely greasy here .. 

Salsa bar has rich flavors 50% of the time... it is usually stocked up which is a plus! red salsa tastes watered down, and needs more cilantro. Green salsa is consistently spicy!"}
{"text":"Love the Arizona burrito! This is a clean and well lit restaurant and perfect after some late night bowling! Carne asada fries seem to be a little smaller than Los Favoritos in Tempe but are still pretty tasty."}
{"text":"I like Filibertos a lot. I have eaten at most of the locations several times. This particular location is pretty reliable, there are some occasional misses but they are rare. They have a fairly nice and large interior with a salsa bar. Try an arizona burrito with beans or the two taco combo... delicious. And don't worry about rumors, I have been eating Filibertos since high school, hundreds of times by now, and have never, EVER, gotten sick."}
{"text":"Whoa Daddy, my favorite Fili-B's! Ok, so occasionally they screw up my order, and yes, it's drive through only unless you want to chance the park benches and chance, 
1. Getting stormed by homeless folk. 
2. Getting stormed by lost hipsters on their way to Pita Jungle. 
3. Getting stormed by Catholics protesting Planned Parenthood. 
4. Getting stormed by embarrassed youngsters looking for Planned Parenthood while cloak and daggering the Catholics. 
5. Getting stormed by pot heads looking for the smoke shop. 
6. Getting stormed by seedy people looking for the sex shop. 
so stay in your car, take it home or to a park and enjoy. The location is not desirable, and they don't always nail your order, but come on, it's Fili-B's! When they get it right, it is SOOOO freaking right."}
{"text":"This location was closed down for several years and has now re-opened under new ownership.  The low ratings were from the previous owner.  You will be pleasantly surprised with the cleanliness; quality of food; and outstanding customer service!!!  I always order the Arizona burrito and a side of rice.  Very fresh food!!

Happy this location is back up and running!!!  Will be back soon."}
{"text":"I love Mexican food & at this particular Fili-B's it is excellent. The wife & I come every \"Taco Tuesday\" for $1 Tacos. I was raised in the Mexican Restaurant business so am super critical. Fili-B's at Williams Field & Val Vista is where the food is perfect, tables clean, bathrooms sanitary, service quick & neighborhood upscale!"}
{"text":"More and more, your Filiberto's, Julioberto's, etc, are becoming bigger and popular \"chains\" around these parts... I guess that's *okay*, but some of the personality and charm is somehow diluted as they grow larger? I dunno, maybe I'm trippin...?

This particular location is still advertised (modestly) in their semi-stained window that they're \"NEW\", which is accurate, however, it seems sorta \"crumby\" and not enough \"maintenance sweeps in the dining area\" are done during the days' traffic. Like, if I were to bet, you could peel back the chair seat seams and find lines of tortilla crumbs. You seriously could. I'm not trying to be mean - just get out the Black & Decker Dustbuster - done!

Prices are fair game and it doesn't take very long to summon your food stuffs, which I totally dig, bc I can be an impatient prick and all... Today, I tried the Cheese Enchiladas and am still gnawing at it 3 hrs later. But. Word the the wise: be careful as you're skipping away from the establishment as to avoid tipping your \"To Go\" bad-for-the-environment styro food thing-y, at all. Why? Because if you have any sort of sauce, beans, etc., you're in a heap of trouble, sugar. I speak of first-hand experience (today), and pretty much stomped back into Fili's with my bottom lip out and thrust the spilled bag before me. The nice lady calmed me down (plus it was hot and I was wearing black and already crabby) and cleaned up my mess of a lunch, served more frijoles that had escaped earlier, and wiped my tears away (kidding).

Place is on my \"rotation\" of regulars for lunch stops, but can improve in some areas!"}
{"text":"By far the best felibertos I have ever been to. Service is amazing. The burritos are super large like the way all felibertos used to be before they made them smaller.  Awesome food specials on already super cheap prices."}
{"text":"I can't believe I even wasted my god damn time coming to this Filiberto's... ordered 3 shredded beef tacos and NONE of them had meat inside, just a little cheese and lettuce. I can't stand horrible customer service and this was absolute BULLSHIT! Not to mention the drive thru lady was SO INCREDIBLY RUDE and looked at me like I was psycho when I asked for red sauce. LIKE UH REALLY LADY?! F*** THIS PLACE it shouldn't even be here I'm appalled."}
{"text":"What a terrible experience. I came here grab dinner because I work nights and its 24 hours. I order and pull to the window with my window still down....the vehicle in front of me is a taxi filled with drunk people one of them standing outside the car....(this is not against drink people ....my friends and I uber through late night drive through all the time.) As I pull up I hear the gentleman standing outside the cab say to the employee let me pay for the girl behind us too since we're obviously gonna take a while and hands him a bill. After waiting a very long time I get to the window and the employee CHARGES ME ANYWAY....I was directly behind this other customer when he offered this good deed and even watched the employee hand him change from the second transaction. How stingy are you??? like really?

I ordered the pollo asada bowl ....My food was disgusting..... I wanted to like it I was starving but the chicken was all fat I was gagging with every bite, I ended up throwing it away I couldn't even stomach eating around it. So disappointed.

Julibertos is just a few mins up the street and 1000 times better. Hope my experience can help yours."}
{"text":"It's a fast food Mexican spot... It is good not great. Better than Taco Bell that's for sure. The 5 dollar specials are great!"}
{"text":"I ordered the carne asada fries... I usually can't finish cuz they give you so much at the other locations... Thus location gave about half of what the other filibertos give. They also wrapped my rolled tacos with cheese in paper?!?!? So the cheese got smashed and stuck to the paper! I won't be going to this location anymore..."}
{"text":"Finally, a place in Anthem that's open till midnight that actually tastes good! I always go for their daily specials, & you really can't go wrong with the amount of food you get for the price. Sometimes the wait is a little long but I don't mind waiting. The salsa bar is awesome too, with some decent options."}
{"text":"Up to about a year ago, this was a good late night joint to fill your stomach on.

Unfortunately, the prices have gone up to such a point where I can no longer recommend eating here. Are you kidding me? 8.69 for the #3? This used to be 6.59! What on Earth caused the prices to skyrocket?
*Edit* HEY! The menu prices they have here on YELP are not the correct ones! These people are dishonestly advertising cheaper prices here than they actually have at their restaurant! Do not support these chiselers!

Asada burrito combo used to be 8 bucks and some change... now it's twelve bucks! What, is there a beef scarcity I am not aware of? 

The quality, being low rent late night fill your belly fare does NOT justify the exorbitant price change. If you want good Mexican, just go to an actual sit down restaurant, as they now cost the same. As for late night diners such as myself, there are much cheaper alternatives. Time to eat burgers instead.

Skip this place, it's only gonna rip you off these days."}
{"text":"Cheap, fast, and fresh. I had a shredded beef taco and shredded beef burrito combination. Rice and beans were a little bland and the burrito came with sauteed veggies in it, so it was a little soggy by the time I got home with it. The real gem was the taco! Although there was a little oil in the bottom of my styrofoam to-go box, this showed me that the taco shell was fried to my order and it was thick and crisp and perfect for holding together the filling, which was hot and moist, with no weird hard pieces. I will definetly be back."}
{"text":"\"I have never gotten sick from this place\" shouldn't be a positive review. I haven't...but still. I stopped going here the second time I got an incorrectly rolled burrito. I mean c'mon! The name of the place is Filibertos and the entire staff is Mexican! Incorrectly rolled burritos? TWICE!?!?! WTF?

It'll work for me if its 230am and I am in a car that is already going through the drive through. I have often made the decision to go to Denny's across the street for late night grub. They've never f'ed up a burrito there!"}
{"text":"The rice was hard and the beans were cold. That was a terrible example for mexican food tonight. (12/26/2011)"}
{"text":"Hit's the spot - not Taco Tore down in El Paso - they set the bar for me in drive through cheap Mexican"}
{"text":"I'm surprised so many people have had bad experiences at this location. This place is a staple for us, we go at least twice a month, usually more. Sometimes something isn't exactly right, but that is rare. The food is always delicious and at a quality that I would expect from Filiberto's. Sometimes there is a bit of a communication issue, so I know not to ask too many questions. But as long as I speak clearly and stick to the menu, everything usually turns out fine. The Green Chile burrito is by far my favorite item, but everything else I've had is pretty good too."}
{"text":"Oh, why can't we leave \"NO STARS\"?

Look, I'm a big food fan, a big Mexican food fan and have a history of understanding all kinds and prices of Mexican food. This is dog food.  Hot sauce is an afterthought. HORRIBLE!

I ordered beef tacos and they were so bad, I took one bite, crumpled the remaining food, and truly wanted to, not just return the horrid food but to lob it on their property like a grenade. Of course, nowadays those things aren't funny or acceptable. Suffice it to say, and I mean this: Taco Bell is NOT more $ and is far better in taste and quality.

Let me say it again: this is dog food."}
{"text":"This Filibertos is pathetic! It's a regular occurrence that they mess your order up. The taco shells are stale & salsa is more like \"a red watery substance\". I drive an extra 8mi to another location. It's worth the drive!"}
{"text":"Never really had any issues til tonight my bf and ordered chicken tacos, the chicken in the tacos were chunky, squishy and just plain gross. We tried to force it down but couldn't it was just not eatable. These pics show how chunky they were and the amount of fat hanging on the chicken. I will never order these again! Beware!"}
{"text":"This is probably the best one around. It's nice to hit after the bars close. I always get a cheese crisp and rolled tacos. Surprisingly, they are never greasy like other berto's. On the weekends the menudo at breakfast is good too."}
{"text":"It's filibertos. Don't come here expecting top notch food. I've been here countless times and I really like the carne Asada fries and burrito, fish tacos, and there 99c rolled tacos on Mondays. They are never stingy with their meat as someone mentioned before and as far as filibertos in general go, this one is pretty great and the staff is very polite. I've never dined in but the facility looks clean. My favorite thing is the 99c tacos with cheese. Get them with some free green sauce and you've got a decent meal!"}
{"text":"When you mess up the order at the window, take 20 minutes only to still get the order wrong, get asked to fix it and STILL get it wrong, you don't need to be in the restaurant business. In fact you shouldn't be working anywhere. Worst location ever! BTW what kind of meat do they use? I'd rather go to Taco Bell..."}
{"text":"I know its quick Mexican foods but it is pretty good and really reasonably priced.  Love this location which is just around the corner from my house. Great 99¢ specials every day of the week except Sunday."}
{"text":"ALWAYS PAY CASH HERE.

This review is not about the food at Filibertos. I love their food and have had many meals from different locations--I need my Filibertos Fix at least once every couple of weeks. Their portions are big and grossly delicious. 

This review is rather about a shady credit card charge at this particular location.

I drove through, ordered my usual #16 (2 fish tacos with rice and beans), and pulled up to pay. $7.26, as always, awesome. I gave them my card, they swiped, I signed a receipt, got one back, drove off, life is wonderful.

2 days later, I'm checking my credit card charges and I see a charge for $9.26 from Filibertos. WTF? Thankfully, I found my receipt from that purchase. Oddly enough, the receipt they gave me listed that I had paid with $7.26 in \"Cash\"--it wasn't a credit card charge slip. I should have looked at what they gave me, but who really does? I just assumed it was a credit card charge slip, crammed it into some orifice in my car and drove off. 

I don't really feel like printing out my credit card statement and arguing with them over $2, especially since this is the closest Filibertos to where I live and I don't want them spitting in my food if they see that it's me in the drive-thru. So the bastards will get away with overcharging my card this time. 

But I definitely did just want to warn you all about this shady business. 

I know I will definitely be paying cash for my meals here now. And counting my change."}
{"text":"Garbage. Felt like it got pulled out of a dumpster. Way overpriced specially with the bad quality of food. Had the 5 mini tacos with adobada and lengua. Horrible. Lengua was yellow on parts, some parts chewy, some parts hard, and some parts soft. Obviously reheated. Adobada was salty and burnt in parts, had to drown it in lemon, thank goodness they had some available. I don't like to complain to the personnel I just never again go. Restaurants need to be more consistent with the food they serve and possibly taste it from time to time see if it's good."}
{"text":"Worst location in the entire franchise. Food tastes like dog meat. Got a fish taco the other day and I swear to god it was a tiny fish stick like you get from the freezer isle. Every bite was tortilla. I have never been so pissed in my life! 

Do yourself a favor and go to another location."}
{"text":"Silly me. I must have I misunderstood the \"Open 24 Hours\" sign in their window to mean they would be open at 5:40 am. It must mean something else.


FYI - THEY NEVER HAVE GREEN SAUCE. What kind of Mexican food restaurant doesn't have green sauce?!"}
{"text":"This place was amazing. I got the number 2 taco and burrito, the portion size was huge. The burrito had to have been a good pound of beef and veggies. All of our food was amazing and very filling. I wish we had this in Utah."}
{"text":"Ugh. I love Filbertos cheap, tasty food but I hate the service! I called earlier today to see if they could deliver. A girl picked up, said \"hold on\" and hung up. Then I called back several times and nobody answered. Pretty obvious they were dodging my calls."}
{"text":"I was on a road trip and i stopped in to eat.. good food and i could grab a drink at the same time..it was great. Ill be back"}
{"text":"I have been here many times.  They are OK, but the other Filiberto's are better.  The portions are always SMALLER at this location and often they mess up my orders.  They only order they haven't messed up is when I go for Taco Tuesday/

The salsa bar is one of the better ones as compared to other locations.

I PREFER the location at McClinktock and Ray as they are ALWAYS consistent."}
{"text":"I have eaten at several different Filiberto's locations.  So far, this is one of the better ones.  Portions are great and service is great.  Only complaint is their hours, I work nights and they close up early.  

They do not have a drive-thru, but it is great to go inside and load up at the salsa bar.

I normally get the same thing, carne asada burrito.  It is good and filling.  

Other locations you can enjoy chips and salsa, but not here.  That is one thing I wish they would add."}
{"text":"One of my favorite Mexican places in AZ.  I always get the carne asada fries and there is always tons of steak.  I've also tried the tacos, taco salad, and the chimichanga and everything has been great!"}
{"text":"Great customer service! Very fast and patient, especially since it took me FOREVER to order!! I will definitely be back to this location!"}
{"text":"Was good. For a fast food taco shop I recommend 100%. Just remember that it is fast food. The patron burrito is awesom!!!! Bacon, ham. And carne Asada with salsa and cheese. All meat burrito. 
I approve and go every Sunday for breakfast 
It's also nice that they have a drive thru and are open 24/7"}
{"text":"If I could give less than 1 Star I would. What can I say this would be the best place if you look forward to bad service. I don't know if the cashier has a problem with listening, but besides not greeting me or anyone else who walked in the place, he messed up my order and others orders. He was even arguing with customers telling them that was not what they ordered, after they would come back and tell him he messed their order up. This guy I believe his name is Chenchito or something like that, needs to take a course on customer service, and also needs an attitude adjustment. I honestly don't see why would anyone would want to come back to this particular place."}
{"text":"I've gone to Filiberto's for awhile since there's not much to choose from out here.  Today I experienced the absolute worst customer service and am inclined to never return.  The food itself is average at best, and not overly cheap compared to other fast food Mexican.  
Anyway today I went in and order an Arizona burrito WITHOUT PICO DE GALLO.  I made this very clear by repeating the without pico de gallo several times because I extremely dislike the taste.  Sure enough they messed up my order anyways and I didn't discover this until I was home.  I figured it was a close enough drive to go back and ask for a new burrito.  The manager refused to remake my burrito without a receipt.  I can see some reasons why they wouldn't but I was there less then 10 minutes ago, they were the ones who messed up, and the worker recognized me.  From my experience in customer service I know when I mess up and a customer has to drive back because of it, I do whatever I can to fix the problem.  In a fit of rage (I was already having a bad day) I drove back and brought the burrito and receipt with me to get a refund.  They offered to remake my burrito, but at this point I just wanted my money back from this pitiful establishment.
TL;DR: Average food at average prices, poor customer service, don't order something with extras or they'll mess it up (this wasn't the first time!)"}
{"text":"Went here last night and was fourth in line at drive through.  It took almost 40 minutes to get my food.  Multiple cars left due to the delay and when I finally got my food there was over 16 cars waiting.  The staff inside couldn't have exhibited the most don't care attitude."}
{"text":"Food is consistent, nothing to rave about, though.  Sometimes the red sauce is delicious and sometimes it is not. 

Biggest complaint: weekday night time drive up cashier is incredibly stingy with red sauce. He gives two containers for two orders of 5 rolled tacos, chips, and a side of rice. If you ask for more, you will get two extra. He acts as though you are taking his hard earned paycheck..."}
{"text":"Ordered some chili Verde frys.. Was good. My sister ordered carna asada frys, her quantity was more. Customer service was not great at all. I mean match quantity.. With better service.. Equals better rating"}
{"text":"I am giving one star because it doesn't have a choice for zero or negative, thought I would finally try Filiberto's - Egg shells in breakfast burrito, ok, give them the benefit of the doubt, happens in rare cases -  same thing in my next bite, (YUK!, spit it out) & after a look at the burrito -  eggshells throughout! I phoned to make them aware and manager wasn't available or so I was told by the rude employee who took the message. Left number for manager to call me back....no call back. Will never go back, and will stick with my Favorites - don't know how this place stays in business with the lack of customer service, bad food & higher prices than other places nearby - this is NOT the way Mexican Food in AZ is. Spoke to some family members about this place and they too have had similar experiences with disgusting food and customer service - wish I would have known ... as long time AZ Residents, do NOT recommend Filiberto's on Pecos in Chandler."}
{"text":"Steak, egg and cheese breakfast burrito. It weighed about 2 pounds, decent flavor, quick drive-thru service. First time trying the chain. Would try it again."}
{"text":"I would give more stars but the drive through line wait time is horrendous 

I love coming in Taco Tuesday for the chicken tacos. It's hard bringing the kids though because everything else is so expensive for a fast food place. I like getting Cherry coke too but costs more than my tacos. 

Either way I like it. Get the drive through times down and it's a 5 star from me."}
{"text":"I have eaten at almost every Filibertos and this one is, by far, the worst two Arizona burritos and they were all potatoes and tomatoes"}
{"text":"Service was a little slow. But food is as always great. Had the rolled tacos because I was short on time. Came out quickly. Hot and fresh. God job

Decor was nice. Place clean. Booths.........little tacky. But good overall"}
{"text":"This place has been quite disappointing. I've gone here several times thinking it'll be different and it's not. It's priced higher than others and I absolutely hate that I've thrown away my food twice from here. Won't be going here again. My Carne asada tasted like fish. Gross. It was like they cooked it either right after each other or together. Three stars bc the staff is great."}
{"text":"Filibertos has always been bad but this location is the worst of all. Their service is unfriendly and their food SUCKS.

I have eaten there twice. The first time I ordered a chili relleno combo. The chili relleno was cold. The beans and rice were flavorless.

The second time my husband picked up a couple breakfast burritos. Mine was supposed to be an egg and cheese, no meat. It was loaded with their disgusting pico de gallo (mostly onions) and had bits of meat in it. So frustrating. 

Filibertos is bad and they know it. But they will never close down because of the drunk asses that crave bad Mexican food in the middle of the night.

Filibertos is one of those few places in Arizona that give Mexican food a bad name. Shame."}
{"text":"Review based on drive thru experience and Green Chili Burrito only.  
Good service in drive thru albiet occasionally slow and a delay acknowledging you even pulled up to order.  
Delicious Green Chili Burrito.  Not too hot (spicy) and not so bland (BORING).
The drive thru is sorta wonky cuz  1) it brings you alongside the front of a plaza where you would enter business(es) and 2) you could have a head in collision with someone entering the parking lot if you're not paying attention to where you're supposed to exit.

And I must say again, delicious Green Chili Burrito. (°  °)
And the Chorizo Burrito is not greasy gross like the ones they give you at the Guadalupe & McClintock (Tempe) location."}
{"text":"The drive thru is more cordial than the counter service.
Okay, this probably isn't true all if the time but it applies to tonight.
The food is inexpensive, portions large, taste generally good too.  
I like the green chili burrito.  It's filled with shredded pork in a green chili sauce and it's got some spice but I still require hot sauce.
Salsa bar has good variety and there's a place where you can serve yourself chips.
Crazy hours -they're open 24/7.  Perfect for the bar crowd."}
{"text":"Filibertos locations typically provide decent food with reasonable prices.  Seriously, compare the menu to Taco Bell amd you'll find a better value at any Filibertos.
My experience here was below average for food, average for customer service and wait time, ordering was uncomplicated.
I like that they have a Value Menu with items that are a mere $1.49.  Today was the Bean Burrito, but no cheese on that so I passed.  Wish it had been the Tostada cuz i would totally eat one of those without cheese.
Being in the mood for a Tostada, I went with the Carnitas Tostada.  Doesn't that sound good?!
Well it was okay I guess.  The pork was either way overcooked or cooked earlier and reheated.  Totally not the way I like meat -hard, dry, chewy.
It was smothered with chopped lettuce so impossible to see the meat before having my first bite.
If I order a Tostada here again I'll opt for something other than Carnitas."}
{"text":"This is the best location that you can go to. Don't expect a ass kissing staff as if you deserve being served on a silver platter because that's not what this place is all about. They make HUGE burritos. Best location in Mesa."}
{"text":"I am a very well acclamated with Mexican food and flavors out of all the places I've been to this is the worst. I got the chicken tacos on taco Tuesday for $0.99 and they taste so bland it's ridiculous. I cannot give them my business anymore, which sucks because I work in the same plaza."}
{"text":"Of all of the Fili-b's I've been to in town, this is the best one! My favorite plate is the Super Nachos, every other Filiberto's is very stingy when it comes to this plate, but this one is very generous with their portions. This is the only Fili-b's I would recommend. Very nice. Very clean. Great salsa bar WITH CHIPS!"}
{"text":"Average fili b's! Only complaint is they have messed up my order 5-6 times in the last year, hate getting home and realizing my food is BOMBED with pico :/"}
{"text":"nothing special to report about this place... its cheap, and its better than Taco Bell.... i ordered the carne asada french fries and they were great, tho a bit sloppy/messy..."}
{"text":"Filly-B's. 

I'm not entirely sure where to start. Filly-B's is open 24 hours a day so that should really tell you where the majority of their profit margin comes from.

I'm not saying it's bad by any stretch of the imagination. Speaking as a guy who can and has frequently crossed the border for lunch and lunch alone, Filly-B's is possibly the most authentic Mexican you can get this far from the border without risking some form of stomach problems that somehow seems to be characteristic of authentic food of any kind. 

Filly-B's bathrooms are of questionable cleanliness and the decor is reminiscent of a time when yellow and brown were the shizzle-nit (yes, I did just say that) but that doesn't change the fact that it is dang good food for when you've been out at a... juice bar.......... 

I would steer clear of their Carne Asada Fries as the number of calories in that dish alone is sure to make an obese person weep, but I urge you to be fearless. Try anything and everything. And for God's sake, if you don't already know, don't ask what menudo is made of."}
{"text":"Cheap yes, good, no.

The flour tortilla was dry and hard, the meat was overcooked in the carne asada burrito and the rice and beans were soggy and gross.

I felt sick after eating here and I only obliged because J said he wants to relive his college days where he'd eat there all the time.  

Thankfully I didn't die.  Felt like it for a few hours afterwards though.  Come here at your own risk."}
{"text":"\"...the exception to the rule...\"

As a regular of the \"Los 24/7-bertos\" style establishments, the chicken tacos, horchata, carne asade fries and breakfast burritos are usually synonymous valley wide as a safe bet for late night Mexican food.  This review is meant as a warning for those who inch through this location's drive-thru.  Here lay the exception.  Unfortunately, on more than one occasion, months, if not years apart, at different times of the day and night, THIS Filiberto's has screwed up  ...wait for it...  chicken tacos.
 
Such a cornerstone type order repeatedly subjected to blasphemy.  
Perhaps there's a sign in the kitchen directing to leave off the pollo in the chicken tacos and replace with lettuce and cheese.  Like being woke from pleasant dreams with a bucket of water, the craving for chicken tacos becomes disillusioned with the first bite; replaced with images of Clara Peller asking \"Where's the beef?\"

The place is clean, in a convenient location, and always open, but a Mexican restaurant in Phoenix Metro screwing up tacos has numbered days.  The places within a mile of here where a customer can get gratifying tacos are boundless.  If you have a hankering for this dialect of Mexican food, drive down the street to the next Filiberto's, or Julioberto's, or Los Beto's...etc. where they're going to hook you up.
Give this one some time to figure out their tacos."}
{"text":"Best customer service EVER. I work nights and Francisco is always working the drive-thru, he is always courteous and makes the best rolled tacos. Haven't been disappointed by this place yet, they're great!"}
{"text":"While they have some better locations, I do like dropping by here when I am in the neighborhood. Consistent food and their burritos are big enough for a hearty meal."}
{"text":"My family has gone to many Filiberto's locations over the years, but this location is THE WORST!  We were the only car in the drive-through lane.  The speaker was broken, so we had to pull up.  (They charge enough, why is their speaker broken?)  After paying almost $30 for 3 food items, we had to wait 20 minutes to get our food!  It was late in the evening and no other customers were there, just us.  When we got home less than 10 minutes later, the nachos were cold, the cheese wasn't melted (I guess it couldn't melt on cold beans), the container was only half full (last time it was so full, it was hard to close the lid), the burritos were supposed to have guacamole, but didn't.  AND, all the food didn't taste good.  The chicken on the burritos didn't taste like normal, just tasted bad, as did the rest of the burritos.  Also, the red taco sauce didn't even taste remotely like it normally does.  It was disgusting.  Since it was late at night and I didn't want to call the people who were working and screwed up the food order, I waited till the next day to call the manager.  Her name was Emily.  I explained and she said that their normal policy is to call the same day and bring the food back.  Who the heck wants to go back out at midnight when you have to work in the morning?  She said she had to call her manager and to call back.  I did, and her manager told her that I could either get a combo meal or a $10 credit.  That's it.  Bad business.  I'll be calling corporate."}
{"text":"I was greeted by a sweetheart of a gal, Maria! This location in MY opinion is the best! My orders have ALWAYS been correct, they've always had friendly staff that actually greet you when you walk in! Efficiency at its finest to say the least! And their salsa bar is always well stocked, extremely clean and they even offered me a cup with a lid so I didn't have to fill up 10+ little cups of their awesome salsa and other fresh treats in their salsa bar!  Thank YOU Filiberto's for another fabulous food feast!!!  You truly do go above and beyond!!!  My belly thanks you too!  Keep up the hard work!  Way to go!!!"}
{"text":"This place has a really cute atmosphere and is very clean. Everyone is friendly and professional. The food came out quickly and is delicious looking and tasting. I definitely recommend if you're looking for good fast food!"}
{"text":"This place is amazing! My Husband used to get burritos from here all the time but I never wanted to try it. I am not big on authentic mexican food. I gave in one day and ordered 3 rolled tacos with cheese and sour cream....OMG! They are absolutely delicious! I actually became addicted to them and I have them as often as I can. This is really the best mexican food I have ever had."}
{"text":"So I am going to have to give them 1 star. Honestly they don't even deserve this. I gave them three different try's. The first time they told me one price and charged my card more then double the price, I went inside the restaurant and told them
The situation and showed them my receipt and they acted like this was my fault and did not want to help me and told me they could not do anything and I would just have to talk to someone there tomorrow let's just say that situation never got taken care of. 2ed time I went there I ordered 2 chicken tacos lucky I was charged the correct amount but they gave me a cheese quesadilla. 3rd time and last time ever I got the carne asada fries..... ate them .....8 hours later I was in the hospital with severe food poisoning. I would not recommend this place to anyone go anywhere else. It's not just about the food being wrong or them charging me over 50 dollars for A quesadilla or me being stuck in the hospital with food poisoning. The staff is just so rude and don't care about there costumes. Stay away for your own safety!"}
{"text":"Worst ever! 
Ordered the chicken chimi and they gave me shredded beef. No veges.
Plastic in the rice and beans too salty.
Just plain simple nasty!"}
{"text":"I would give this place 0 stars if it were possible. Nobody ahead in the drive through lane and it still takes 30 minutes for them to even greet you."}
{"text":"I like this place, and i am going to keep going there because i get 2 decent meals out of a plate, and it is convenient. But tonight, i ordered the Chile Relleno. It was not stuffed. Relleno means stuffed..."}
{"text":"Service was fast the food was good at this location the restraunt was very clean I think my guys and I will eat here all week while we work down near south mountain. Love the Nachos and the Carne Asada Burrito"}
{"text":"This past weekend, I went there because the homegirl raved about how good it is. So I got dragged along. I thought the combos were generous and looked tasty. You know how you're looking forward to something after some has talked it up? Yea well, when it takes a serious dive to hell you never want to listen to that person again.
Filiberto's is a no go. The chicken taco was bland. The beans were decent but not great. The burrito was filled with DRY DRY DRY stringy, shredded beef and nothing else. I barely made it through the taco. 
The service was nice but they were under staffed for Sunday lunch rush.
No no Filiberto."}
{"text":"This is the worst of all the Filibertos I have ever had, from the food to the way they handle the complaint. I picked up one of my favorite orders, Carne Asada fries, and a Carne Asada Plate. The meat was spoiled and sour. As I used my lunch break to go get the food I was not able to return the food. When I spoke to Bianca she said I would have to bring the food back for any resolution. I let her know I would be leaving a review and she had no problem with that. As she was rude on the phone I have no problem loosing the $20 I spent to let everyone else know to stay away from this one. Absolutely horrible."}
{"text":"You are not going to get a crazy A class Mexican treatment but at 1 am its perfect. I recommend getting a Texas burrito with beans added , it will hit the spot."}
{"text":"When it comes to the food, you know what you're getting....diet-destroying goodness. Besides the great food, the place is the cleanest of all locations that I've visited (Almost every spot in PHX). The counter people are super courteous and always wearing a smile. I'm a regular and that won't change anytime soon."}
{"text":"What's not to like. Traditional Filiberto's in a high-end neighborhood. My favorite is the carne Assad. Great food, clean environment, great service"}
{"text":"Taste okay but I found a barcode sticker in my carne asada burrito.. won't be ordering from here again.. kinda gross who knows what else is in here.."}
{"text":"Waited 25 minutes to say outta chips for super nachos then another 29 to get through line after ordering nothing. .  Will never go back"}
{"text":"My friends and I were hungry after the ASU football game and decided to come here before a night on Mill. BIG MISTAKE! Coming here after Mill when you're too drunk to know what's good food? Maybe.

Being from the OC/SD area, when I heard they make California burritos I had to try one. While it wasn't absolutely horrible, it was totally not up to par with all the amazing SD establishments. It was a burrito that much I know. However if you were to blindfold me and ask me what type of burrito it is, I wouldn't be able to tell you it's a California burrito. Pretty scary if you ask me.

I also tried their chips which seemed stale and their horchata, which passed as horchata but was pretty watered down.

Maybe I'll have better luck trying one of their combos next time. AFTER Mill..."}
{"text":"The worst steak and egg burrito I've ever had.  I asked for rice and beans for my moms cheese enchiladas and no rice and beans.  To top it off when my mom \"who is in a nursing home\" went to eat her enchiladas they were cold and the cheese never melted!!  Wow!!  Won't go there again!"}
{"text":"My fiancée, a native of Phoenix, is a huge fan and has been coming here since she was a little girl.  Now that she's moved away, this is one of the first stops that she (and I) make during our annual Christmas visit to her family.  I'm from the east coast so I enjoy the the 'authentic' Mexican as well.  Not this year.  Our visit happened about 1200 yesterday (21st).

First off, they get our order wrong.  We ordered one chicken taco, one carne asada taco, one tostada, and two bean/cheese burritos-one with extra cheese.  We received everything but the carne asada taco-which came out as a burrito, and neither of the bean/cheese burritos had the extra cheese.  Not huge mistakes but annoying nonetheless.

The big problems came when my fiancée bit into her tostada.....ice cold refried beans that 'tasted funny'.  Same with the burritos,beans that couldn't melt the shredded cheese inside.  I didn't have a bite of either burrito because my fiancée couldn't tell which one has extra cheese (neither).  The biggest problem came a bit later that day when she developed food poisoning.  She was up all night dealing with it.  (My taco and carne asada burrito were good.)

While food poisoning sucked, she was a bit more upset that she can no longer go to Filibertos.   Can't go back.  Sorry memories."}
{"text":"Went there Sunday midday. Spent ~$13 for two \"Foods\" and a drink. My fish tacos were real good. Wife's salad was not bad either but tacos were better.
All in all its a pretty good and tasty value."}
{"text":"This place is good if you want decent Mexican food fast, or just a late night bite to eat.  They will not blow you away, but certainly several steps above Taco Bell or Del Taco.  The prices are fair, ingredient quality is average (sour cream lacks flavor), and the menu selection is wide.  All and all you can't go wrong with a stop off at this Valley wide chain!

Good: any of their quesadillas.

OK: nachos

Avoid: Chimichangas"}
{"text":"Upon arrival, you are given a newspaper with Glendale news from a many years ago. Mine was a 1967 front page newspaper, inside which guests will find the menu. I really enjoyed this feel, made you feel almost like you are at your own kitchen table. Older interior but kept clean, very nice homey feel-very welcoming atmosphere. Servers are all smiles and very kind, mostly women, at least in the morning when I visited. Play oldies music in background, easy listening. 

Average plate price looked to be in the 7.50 to 10.00 range. Has full breakfast, lunch and dinner menu. Meal came out within 5 minutes. I ordered the Huevos Rancheros Benedict for 10.49 (yes more expensive than most but sounded so good). Potatoes not as crisp as I normally like but tasted fresh which is most important. The fruit was fresh, crisp, and cool. The eggs Benedict were good, just slightly, again, not as crispy as I would prefer on the English muffin. The meal I selected had green chillies, pulled pork, and of course a poached egg. I never had this before and would probably order a bacon or sausage Benedict instead next time, simply because that is what I am used to for breakfast taste. Overall, however, a tasty meal with a drink that stayed filled.

I would certainly come here again; the lunch menu looks very appealing to me with fresh sandwiches and salads. The menu has a \"little less\" section for seniors or people that don't swallow as much food as the average joe. Those prices are in the 6.00-7.50 range. They also have a conference room for guests with large parties. I saw some family or company meeting at 8:30am on a Thursday! I was surprised, but they seemed to be enjoying themselves.

Again, overall a very good experience. I am very glad it was clean and welcoming."}
{"text":"Eh, I suppose for a fast food chain this place was OK. I will say that they had a fantastic salsa bar, made my below average tasting meal tolerable"}
{"text":"You'll be scared of the area, so make sure you lock your doors and don't leave anything in plain sight. If you can get beyond that, and into this little dive, it's a great stop off the 10 fwy on a road trip for Mexican food. Friendly, casual, and good food."}
{"text":"Yes open 24/7 but food sucks. Ordered a carne Assad's burrito .. cold and everything cold. Sucks to have hot food cold. Hate it. Fix your crap and serve hot food hot.."}
{"text":"I really like filibertos. When I moved here my husband had to talk me into trying it. I was very hesitant that it could be THAT good. Boy I'm glad he did! Good food, low prices and great horchatas! This is my go to place in the summer for the horchatas and whenever I'm craving some quick Mexican food."}
{"text":"Stopped off for lunch, I wish I had not!!! Carne Asada Burro, Not good!!! Salsa bar, non existent, customer service, ok, can do much better! Location and parking, worst ever!! Spend your $$$ down the street at the gas station and get a frozen burro cause its probably better tasting."}
{"text":"Awful drive thru experience. I've not visited a Filiberto's in years, and this does not make me want to start up again. I spent nearly 30 minutes in line for food- with only 3 cars ahead of me. Not sure what the deal was, but oh man, it was frustrating to watch each car ahead of me take 10 minutes to pay/receive their order. And there were numerous mixups during the order process- I had to repeat my order several times but they did get it right in the end.

The food is still \"alright\" - great homemade tortillas, and plenty of options. They have just about every conceivable combo order you can imagine. The sides (beans & rice) are below average with not a whole lot of taste. My carne asada burrito was dry and I forget there's really nothing in it. I had to douse it with their red sauce to add some sort of flavor. My wife got the supreme chicken quesadilla and she seemed to have liked it. As always, portions are incredibly large. We barely finished 1/2 our plates in the end. Oh yeah, the diet Cokes were completely flat- zero carbonation. 

So between the extremely awful drive-thru and the sub-par food I'm throwing 2 stars their way. The girl that took my money was very nice so that at least took some of the pain out of the overall deal. But in the end, I'm staying away from Filiberto's Gilbert. The 24-hour operation is probably a bonus for some of the patrons."}
{"text":"Filleberto's has been delivering mid-grade, greasy Mexican cuisine in the valley for years now. I remember many late night trips to consume a carne asada burrito with friends before heading home, and the quality of food really hasn't changed all that much. For decent pries you get huge portions of food. Their tortillas are made fresh and are actually very good. I tried the chorizo breakfast burrito for the 1st time; beyond it's massive size it was okay. The chorizo was a little over cooked and they seemed to have skimped on the egg (mostly potatoes and cheese). The drive-thru wait at this location was excruciatingly long for 8:30a on a Sunday morning, but whatever. I paid $12 for two breakfast burritos. Their red hot sauce it tasty, make sure to ask for some with your order- not really that hot at all."}
{"text":"I don't have high expectations when I visit here.  But this time, Our orders were correct and fresh. The soda machine wasn't working correctly and they gave us Horchata instead. They didn't have to, but they did.  I may return within a year."}
{"text":"I don't see why people are complaining about a Mexican place that stays open 24hrs. It's very convenient when you work late or are drunk its the best thing in my opinion. The breakfast burrito is great and taco salad with shredded beef is very good. I thought it was great for the hours and quaility. I think it is better than del taco."}
{"text":"Do you guys ever cook your food? Just got home & my enchiladas feel like they've been sitting in the fridge. Awful."}
{"text":"I ordered carne asada. The meat was tougher than shoe leather. Buy skirt steak and marinate it. If you need to charge a couple dollars more no problem people will pay in Anthem. This was ridiculous so touch and full of grizzle and zero flavor."}
{"text":"Theyre kinda slow and always forget my drink but the food is great!!! We never went here because we didn't actually believe it was a real Filiberto's lol!!!!"}
{"text":"Decent food...terrible service. Lady was rude at the counter. I like this chain...maybe I'll just have to go to a different one next time."}
{"text":"What can i say it was late and we were starving.  The food was alright but nothing special.  Kind of overpriced, but the portions are pretty big. Staff was a dud except for the cook in the back who kept smiling at me and telling me to come back again. I like their little condiment bar but it was not very well kept and very dirty. 

I definitely wanna go back just not this location."}
{"text":"Bad service, guy working drive thru looked like he was in hell. No communication no thank you whatsoever."}
{"text":"The best late night Mexican spot in all of Arizona. Sweeeaaar!!! Get the fish tacos. So when I walked in no one was in here so it's perfect at 1:37 when you don't want annoying drunk people in here and just want to enjoy some AMAZING tacos."}
{"text":"Good food, fast service. For 4 tacos it was 12.00...
It's nice that they have a drive thru and are open 24 hours."}
{"text":"Friendly fast service ! I went through the drive thru and was immediately helped. I needed a minute to look at the menu and the guy taking my order told me to just let him know when I was ready. I ordered 2 combos and asked for all rice on one and all beans on the other. I only had to wait a couple of minutes for my order to be ready and it was delicious! They got the order right, I'll be back!!"}
{"text":"Horrible food! Husbands order was wrong even after confirming with employee and greasy at that. Same goes for my quesadilla that was dripping with grease! Inedible and when we called back their employee didn't have a manager or person in charge we could talk to. He said he would call us back without even taking a ticket number name and number. How is that even possible. Anyway this isn't the first time their food was left untouched by us and it's going to now be the last. So, not worth eating here."}
{"text":"Girl taking our order was nice, and food looked delicious. Unfortunately it was disgusting! I had the chicken enchiladas, and as soon as i was done, my stomach started hurting instantly. I tried the horchata too, which was not good at all. Tasted like a watered down vanilla raspado. Definitely one of the grossest mexican food places i have tried in town. Will never come here again!"}
{"text":"I work evenings at an office building next door to this restaurant.

For me it is a convenient, consistent, and economical option for take out.

I usually order the Carne Asada Fries or the Carne Asada Burrito; it's always good, and exactly what I expect from a Filberto's.

The hostesses are always friendly and the wait time is generally very reasonable.

I expect I will continue to be a regular patron whenever I'm in the mood for some Sonoran street food for supper."}
{"text":"Wow....they've really gone downhill since my last visit....the breakfast burrito didn't taste bad, it just didn't have any taste at all!!"}
{"text":"great food! & love location. but just wish the beans in your burritos had more flavor! :("}
{"text":"If I could do zero stars I would. Melissa gave me the worst customer service I have ever received at this location. This location is down the street from my house so I come very often, not for their customer service but because it's convenient. Tonight was just awful. I always order through drive thru and add chipotle salsa to anything I get. Their chipotle salsa is the bomb! But, Melissa told me I needed to get off and go inside if I wanted it tonight. I said \"excuse me? I always come here 2-3 times a week and I was never told this before.\" She said just come to the window then. So at the window after I handed her my card, she told me I needed to go inside to get the salsa. She said look you have people behind you. I told her to please cancel my order and handed her back my drink. I just couldn't understand so much laziness, your salsa bar is just there, I'm paying for my food and I would like the salsa that I like.  She then said I already charged you and half your food is ready as she rudely grabbed the drink back. (Then I wonder, If only half my food was ready when I was at the window, couldn't she had gone to the salsa bar to get the chipotle sauce??) What made me angrier is that she walked away from the window and got Sergio to hand me my receipt back. Sergio told me that I need to go back tomorrow to get my refund!! I said can I please talk to your manager? Sergio told me there was no manager on duty so no one could issue me a refund. $29 were waisted. Im definitely never going back to this location."}
{"text":"Pretty ghetto restaurant, not a surprise though based on the prices.

I've always heard people complaining about Filiberto's and getting food poisoning and whatnot, however in 5 years that's yet to happen to me.  Many a long night of drinking has ultimately led me here, and my favorite thing to get, hands down, is the pollo asado burrito.  Carne asada isn't too bad, either, and I really can't comment on most of the other food because I mainly eat those two burritos.  I've taken my parents here a few times when they'd flown into town and their only complaint was that they kept getting too much food and would never be able to finish the leftovers.

It's not some la-di-da place, however Filiberto's will always have a place in my heart..."}
{"text":"Absolutely the worst taco salad i've ever gotten in my life. Grease soaked meat, NO lettuce, covered in a cup of sour cream and guacamole. Disgusting!!!! I won't be back!"}
{"text":"This is a solid place for late night food.  It is not much to look at.  The service is questionable.  The food satisfies your late night Mexican cravings.  It is also cheap.

I ordered five rolled tacos with sour cream and cheese.  Rolled tacos are taquitos in my world.  You will need four or five rolled tacos to satisfy your hunger.  I think they come in five counts.  The taste is just OK.  A little hot sauce helps a lot.  You get a lot of cheese and sour cream.

I tried a friend's quesadilla.  It was packed full.  The taste was decent.  Another item where hot sauce goes a long ways."}
{"text":"It's the same ol' irresistible bundle of greasiness you've come to expect from every other little Mexican food joint that ends with an -OS, except that it's all shiny and brand new. Also, they don't appear to be nearly as stingy with their hot sauce as some, they are open 24 hours, and their horchata is delicious."}
{"text":"Great Beef Tacos . . . 99 cents on Tuesday. Bean and Cheese Burritos are always good. Chips with Guacamole are good side for the starving ones! Awesome Friendly service, LOVE how they remember the regulars . . . 

Overall - - 

BEST Fili-B's in the Valley!"}
{"text":"Amazing service from Veronica & absolutely great food, they hooked it up for sure! Thank you Veronica!"}
{"text":"awesome place. stopped in since we wanted Mexican and they had a check in special. the free rolled tacos sucked, but my burrito was great, and fresh. the chicken tacos were out of this world!!! my only two issues are the soda fountain being in the back(and they aren't always up front to refill your cup) and the various salsas aren't that great. you also have to ask for napkins cause they keep them in the back. the cook was friendly and this place is very cheap!!"}
{"text":"This is actually the nicest Filibertos I've ever been to.  Most of them are divey or just drive thrus with some outdoor seating. This one was clean and more modern inside.

The service was decent, but nothing to write home about.

They had chips and salsa, which I've never seen at a  Filibertos.

I got the carne asada burrito, which was larger than the ones from Nico's in Tucson.  I couldn't finish mine. 

Since there are no Nico's in Phoenix, Filibertos is a good runner up."}
{"text":"I love to go to Filiberto's on taco Tuesdays for their $1 tacos they are cheap and so delicious especially with the green salsa they they have."}
{"text":"I stopped by this Filiberto's for breakfast on my way to work.  It was an okay experience, the cashier at the window was really nice, but the food took a little long to prep.  I ordered a side of sour cream and it was $1.19.  Granted it was a healthy portion of sour cream but I had ordered a small burrito, so I more than enough leftover.  I could have used half the amount for half the price.  I will definitely go back since it's fairly close to my house, I'll just make sure to leave a little earlier if I have someplace to be."}
{"text":"Filiberto's gets it done and gets it done well.  As a person who has spent $10 per plate for Mexican food, Filiberto's will give the same quality (minus the huge hot plate and not so clean silverware), at about half the price.  The staff is friendly and the food is good.  I'll be back!"}
{"text":"Often go for quick and easy eats.
Food quality and customer service do not disappoint.  
Only small complaint is lately with fried orders, such as their taquitos, is they are quickly placed in their to-go box.
This then melts the box, making a hole and food spills out, etc. 
Happened three times already."}
{"text":"Speaker system for drive through is extremely low quality. Got the order completely wrong and bag was dripping with grease. Disgusting food and bad customer service."}
{"text":"Ahh, yes! 

Ahwatukee Douchebaggery meets what's supposed to be unpretentious late night Mexican fare. 

Won't hide it, I dig Filiberto's from time to time.

The bean and cheese burrito is delicious, quesadillas aren't too bad, and the carne asada fries (hold the liquefied guacamole) act as the perfect booze absorption method. The red salsa is good, too! 

Most of the time I come in after a night of binge drinking; sometimes sober. 

This occasion was one of the sober ones. Dude and I were dog/house sitting down here for a few weeks and thought a Fili B's run was a great idea to go with our beer growler. 

$10 Carne Asada Nachos? Ok, ridiculous, but whatever. 
 
Are you going to get a solid customer service experience at a Fili B's?

Absolutely not, and I don't expect one.

But being insanely rude to customers at the drive up window, practically throwing our debit card back, and intentionally sticking green salsa in our bag with a side of heavy eye rolling after we requested the red (in response to you asking which type, twice)?  

Unacceptable.

Next time, I'm just going to Toxic Smell."}
{"text":"I refuse to eat here again. A piece of plastic from the bag containing the raw beans was in my cooked bean burrito. They have raised prices again at this location, They did make me another burrito, but i don't want to eat at a place that doesn't care about what they serve the customer."}
{"text":"we had been frequenting this location for many years (probably 60+ visits), but we will never go there again. . it has gone so downhill...i agree with the earlier review that stated that it should be closed down. it seems like every surface in this place is dirty, and the service is exactly what the opposite of friendly is. you would think that after giving this place so much business, after being regular customers for so many years, that we would be treated nicely...not the case. we were treated so rudely the last time we went (by an awful lady who works the drive-thru window late at night), that we vowed to never go there again.  there is a new location over on priest and washington that has much better condiments, is a much nicer restaurant, and has a far friendlier staff."}
{"text":"One of the first Mexican places I liked when I recently moved here. Unfortunately even though there are so many locations this is the closest one which is not really close, lol. The food is pretty good, not the best but really good and way better then Fredrico's. The only grief I have with this location is this one lady.. she speaks really quiet and mumbles through the drive - thru intercom. I ask her to repeat what she says and she gets so annoyed. I even thought maybe it was the system, but when I pulled to the window, I saw that it was her. But it's not like she's working the drive thru every time I go so.. I'll deal."}
{"text":"Usually I am a fili b's fan but today and this location, I had the worst food ever made! Didn't even taste similar to how their food normally tastes. WILL NOT RETURN to the gilbert and baseline location EVER."}
{"text":"The food and service were good.  We wanted more authentic Mexican.   Problem was that our plates came out in spurts.   Our table of five had two people served, waited five minutes, another plate, then five to ten minutes the other Plates.    Then, something my husband ordered came just as we were packing up leftovers and ready to go."}
{"text":"My favorite 'fast food' Mexican place in the Hills.
The people are all fantastic. The food isn't greasy. The salsa is yummy. I've had their beef tacos, a number of their different fabulous burritos. It's all been yummy so far. Shredded beef taco is my favorite here.
Skip the other one - hit up this one. You can thank me later!"}
{"text":"I used to like the Carne Asada, then one day I got a Toe nail in my burito. So Gross I want to puke thinking about it.. I quit going for several months, and went back our of desperation late at night. This time got a carne Asada again and this time with the time of someones fingernail, So gross.. NEver again. If you like mystery meat then you would like this place. GROSS"}
{"text":"Very rude staff.  When I asked a question about a menu choice she laughed at me because I didn't know the answer.   Food was mediocre at best and woman was down right nasty!    She even snapped at my daughter because she asked for a bean and cheese burrito with cheese she yelled it comes with cheese honest mistake from a little girl but woman was so rude!!!"}
{"text":"OK so I was on my way home from work when I got lost but I was really hangry (Once again) so I had to find a place to get myself some fish tacos. Whelp! (rhymes with Yelp) whadya you know?! Where ever you are you're Never far from a Filiberto's!
The real disappointment is when you get to a Filiberto's whose fish tacos are smaller & come with less sauce and less salsa than the others - This, my yelp friends is one of those disappointing locations. I wasn't super impressed with the size of my tacos or the way they were put together. No doubt, I will be back if I'm ever in need again. Customer service was grand but I like to enjoy my food..."}
{"text":"Been here several times. Always have a great experience. Food is great and the help is friendly. I don't know why this place has negative reviews but places like Rito's has good reviews, that place is nasty"}
{"text":"Taco Tuesday.
Fast becoming an institution in the landscape of Mexican food eateries. 
Only if you decide to eat here, brace yourself. 

Filibertos has a ninety-nine cent taco that's enormous and, from outward appearances looks and smells delightful. 
Order two and a cup of water, the bill will come to just over two bucks. 

Now, take a bite out the the first taco and let the disbelief envelope you. How could anything that looks so good taste so bad?
Try the other. 
Yeah, no, it's crap too. 

Only one thing left to do.
Wrap them up and take them back to the office to feed the stray that's been threatening to disembowel you upon arrival at the job trailer each morning.
Yes, I think you'll find, as I did, these tacos make a wonderful peace offering, allowing you ample time to open the gates and get safely inside the office before being attacked. 

Anyway, the shell is cooked to perfection. I ate some of it along wit the lettuce and cheese. 
However, a weird thing happened while nibbling at it; when I picked up the taco to take a bite, in the typical taco-eating manner - listing to about 75 degrees - my lunch buddy interrupted my bite by droning on about something that demanded I respond. 

Being the friend I am, I perched the taco close to my mouth and held it for a brief moment, all the while eye-signaling him to shut the fuck up so I could take a bite. 
He continued talking.
So now, pretending I was interested in what he was saying, I sat the taco back onto its plate but in doing so, I noticed a puddle of oil had managed to drain from the damned thing.
And it wasn't a small puddle. 
This was an oil spill even BP execs would marvel at.

So unless you find yourself in a tight spot with a threatening animal, or, you have a penchant for all things oily, there's no need to try the tacos here. 

Per my previous review, just stick with the bean burrito.
I think they have to work really hard to fuck-up refried beans."}
{"text":"This chain, irregardless of location, irregardless of price, is one of the best Mexican Restaurants (Taqueria, Taco Truck, Fast Food Place, whatever)! When I worked in Phoenix over ten years ago, I was a frequent flier. The lines on Friday and Saturday night at any of the Filiberto's locations are very intimidating! When my kids from Las Vegas went to school here a few years ago, I introduced them to Filiberto's, and it became one of their favorite hangouts at anytime of day or night! My daughter had to hold back her desire for Mexican food, though... I guess because she got a little chubby...

Take a look at the Filiberto's Menu at http://www.filibertos.com/arizona/menu.asp ! I can't see how they're making any money at all! 

My favorite dishes are (in order of taste):

   Chile Relleno - I guess, by now, yelpers know I LOVE Chile Relleno,
      and have been looking for Chile Relleno the way FIliberto's makes 
      it in Northern California. I don't know how they do it... the batter that 
      covers the Relleno is still crunchy after hours of immersion in the 
      Relleno sauce. So, even after hours of sitting in the frig, the
      Filiberto's Chile Relleno still retains a crispiness as when you first 
      bought it! --- In all the months I had been eating at Nena's in 
      Stockton, California, I only had that happen once!

   Steak Ranchero - Man, this dish is GOOD. Two large slices of 
      angus beef, with an egg, and Pico de Gallo! What more can you 
      ask for! Just don't let the beef sit for too long... it's still cooking if 
      you let it sit!

   Machaca - Made just the way I like it!

   Potato, Egg & Cheese Breakfast Burrito - The Potatoes just give it a 
      flavor that none of the other Breakfast Burritos have! This is the only
      dish that Filiberto's has that I can find cheaper in Northern 
      California (It's $2.50 at Nena's)!

The morning I left the Phoenix area until who knows when... I ordered an order of Steak Ranchero, two orders of Chile Relleno... just so I could take some original Mexican back to Northern California! Yelpers in the Phoenix area... take a look at my reviews to see all I had to go through to find a decent Mexican place in Northern California! That's how good this place is!"}
{"text":"I keep trying to check into this location but it is not on Yelp so I am forced to review it... ha ha, anyway.  I go here since it is close to my home and it is better than the other place on Lake Pleasant and 83ave (cant remember the name of the place).  It is still no Carolinas but they have decent chorizo burritos and the rolled tacos and beans are way better here.  It looks like this location is pretty new."}
{"text":"Long wait at drive thru and I ordered a bean and cheese burrito and only got a bean burrito.  This is not the first time these things have happened,  I think I'm going to start going to Los Favoritos more and here less."}
{"text":"Roll the dice- Either the order is right, hot and good or you get home, Order is wrong and ain't no point in going back- everyone else's food will be cold by then."}
{"text":"Good for midnight munchies before a Netflix movie. Typical production line Burrito fares (similar to Juliberto, Poliberto, Roliberto...Are there any others? ). Whilst probably not the best burrito I've ever eaten, Filiberto is close to my house and definitely a hunger saver. I've only gotten food here from the drive through, so I can't comment about the inside.
Overall, not bad for a quick fix of American Mexican food."}
{"text":"First introduced to Filibertos 20 years ago and it is still my go to Mexican restaurant when I need to soak up the alcohol and a quick cheap taco or burrito.

I mainly go here for Taco Tuesday.  They have specials everyday but I go foe the tacos.  And this place has a free chip bar.

Some if my favorites to order are the tacos, carne asada burrito, chicken enchilada, and the steak ranchero.  Oh, and don't forget about the 3 rolled tacos with cheese.

The snooty people don't like these kinds of dives but I don't mind.  This location is a lot cleaner that other Mexican restaurant establishments."}
{"text":"Over 15 minutes wait for a freaking burrito like are you totally kidding me. Like I had to turn off my car at the drive through window because she didn't give me any type of disclaimer that it was going to take this long. Like this has never happened to me before in my life!!!! I'm not sure if I should just drive off hungry....like I see 5 employees....WTFFFF is talking so long. Then she brings my burrito out in a WET bag. I'm sitting here like WHAT IN THE WORLD. Then I stuck my head out and asked, \"Where's Ashton? I must be getting punked?!!\""}
{"text":"Best Filiberto's in town. Very clean dinning area. Friendly staff. You can tell they make their salsa fresh as it has a good kick and lots of cilantro. I appreciate the various menu items and jr. Burritos and the usual ones are always just a tad to much to eat for me."}
{"text":"This is the worst fast food restaurant i north Phoenix. I don't usually give places bad reviews but when Ive given this place numerous chances and everytime it disappoints than it needs to be addressed to others. Today's experience: 

The #19: burrito and enchilada.

Okay... What kind of burrito?!? And what kind of enchilada?!? 

So I kindly ask, what kind.. And they answer as if your an idiot like we're supposed to magically know what kind of burrito it comes with. Secondly... I asked to add cheese to the burrito... And instead of beans and rice as the side just do double beans.

When I get my order, I realized they overcharged me on top of the astronomical price of $10 for a burrito that came with meat, cheap ass cabbage and pico. They also didn't add cheese like I asked but added beans... Then instead of apologizing they said, we'll give us back the burrito and we're going to refund you the dollar we overcharged you then ask for an extra dollar after because they realized that they forgot to charge me for the extra cheese that they originally forgot to put on my burrito. This place is unfreaking real and extremely overpriced."}
{"text":"I'll admit to my vices. I have a tendency to get pretty drunk on weekend nights and wake up with a raging hangover. I'm convinced that the only cure is a breakfast burrito from Filibertos, with a healthy side of the red hot sauce. I pretty much only make it to Fili's for breakfast, but they also have GIANT burritos that are cheap and filling. My favorite: Carne Asada with rice."}
{"text":"Their cowboy fries is something else. I like it with shrimp instead of the chicken. It's a great place for a good and a quick meal after midnight."}
{"text":"I like that this Filiberto's is 24 hours. It got me through many long nights in college. The food is good most of the time. Service has never been great but that's par for the course and I didn't really mind. It would be better if they would repeat back your order at the drive though to make sure they got it right, but most of the time it's right so that's not a big deal.

Today we ordered 2 burritos for my boyfriend and his friend and chips and salsa for me. I friggin love the salsa here. 

We should have checked the bag before we left. We should have put the receipt in the bag where were could have found it easily.. but we've never had any problems so it didn't seem necessary at the time.

When we got home there was no salsa. :( We looked for the receipt, but couldn't find it. I figured it wouldn't be a big deal because it's just a cup of salsa.. not a plate of chimichangas or something. I drove back in the heat, walked in, and asked for my salsa. The guy asked if I had my receipt, I said no, but we were literally just there. Just now. I asked him why he needed my receipt for *salsa* and he said it was to make sure I had ordered from that filibertos. Seriously? Like I'm trolling all the filibertos in town looking for salsa? I worked in retail so I know about needing receipts and blah blah, so I felt awkward pushing this, but it's salsa.. not an enchilada combo meal.. not even a quesadilla. Salsa. Like half a cup of it. And I am pretty sure this is the guy who took our order in the drive-thru minutes before.

Eventually he went into the back room for a minute and came out with salsa which he gave to me, but since this was such a drama, I didn't feel comfortable eating the salsa when I couldn't see him put it in the container... so I guess I'm eating something else today.

Basically? Make sure you check your drive-through order. From now on I am always checking before we leave. Keep your receipt too in case you are missing half of what you ordered.

As a side note, make sure you have cardboard or paper or something in your car if you order more than one helping of chips. The chips are BURNING HOT and melt the containers together. We usually pull them apart immediately and put paper or something between before it gets bad. Sometimes it makes the chips smell/taste like plastic too.."}
{"text":"Turns out this location does not have salsa at all besides their terrible pico de gallo. If you ask for chips and salsa and don't want pico de gallo, your only other option is a GIANT container of the watery \"red sauce\" crap. wtf. like they can't even make salsa, possibly the easiest part in mexican food. 

Is this even a real, licensed Filibertos, I wonder? Whatever, I'm never going back. Hope they get shut down."}
{"text":"They are the slowest drive thru I have ever be threw. I go there on my lunch break and only order a simple bean and cheese burrito and it takes them literally 10-15 minutes to give it to me every time! Service is horrible!"}
{"text":"Can't believe I've lived in the Valley almost 10 years before my 1st visit to Filiberto's.  I've tried several things on the menu, but this is the bottom line - the places are SPOTLESS.  The food is cheap and real and good.  I'm partial to a tostada when I'm in a hurry.  I'll get an enchilada plate if I'm in the mood to sit down.  Both fill me up.  The salsa bar is always a nice touch, although I don't think their salsa is the best.  Quality fast food and a good price."}
{"text":"Employee closed early just a moment ago... It's 11:23 PM

Not cool

I wonder if her boss knows."}
{"text":"Es un exelente lugar .la fuente de salsas es muy bueno.las sanahorias en cebiche .todo es fresco.del dia.mi favorito platillo es las enchiladas y los chiles rellenos..estan deliciosos..."}
{"text":"I just had the worst experience I've ever had in any restaurant, ever.  I won't waste the review space to say how absolutely awful the food was; this is truly the worst Filiberto's I've ever been to.  I wish I'd read the other reviews that say the same thing.

Like other reviewers, my wife and I waited a ridiculously long time for our food.  We did not check the two bags before we left and, upon arriving at home, realized we were missing a meal and a side order.  I went back to the store figuring they would have either realized the error and had it sitting at the counter or would acknowledge the error and get me the missing food.

The employee I spoke with (who later identified himself as the manager) was not only rude, he was aggressive and argumentative.  I eventually got my nachos and another rude comment, but frankly, with the way the staff acted, I did not feel comfortable giving the food to the intended recipient.  Staff is as bad as the food.  The other reviewers are spot-on: this place is truly bottom-of-the-barrel awful."}
{"text":"Location was very dirty.  The food was ok.  The meat was not great but ok, if you looking for a quick taco.  A little to pricy for what you get."}
{"text":"Cheap, huge burritos. Enough said!
A little less Americanized than Del Taco.
Any of the burritos (breakfast, chicken) you order is pretty good for fast food Mexican."}
{"text":"This was my 1st time trying this joint - after reading the reviews I was a bit \"iffy\" but I said what the heck! My boyfriend told me they had good carne asada fries so I ordered that... They where delicious! I didnt go inside as there is a drive thru (Scooore!) but the carne fries where nice & warm. I requested no sour cream & guess what?! NO SOUR CREAM! AWESOME SAUCE! 

I will have to visit soon & try there other items"}
{"text":"The food was disgusting here. I love filibertos but this one is nasty, the food taste weird like it was old. I ordered a carne asada quesadilla and my sister carne asada fries. We both agreed the meat was salty and harder then usual and tasted bad i spit it out. Never coming here i found a new favorite spot and it was NOT filibertos. Go to Ramiros!!"}
{"text":"Will never visit this Filiberto's again and will never recommend anybody to eat there sloppy undercooked food horrible service in the supposed \"manager\" could really care less!!! 
 
There's a Federico's with a drive thru on 35th and baseline I will drive the extra mile from now on,"}
{"text":"As someone who moved from Phoenix to Boston, it has become impossible to find a place like FIliberto's here. Appreciate what you all have in Phoenix. There is no review I could write to explain the sorrow that I have for leaving behind Filibertos. I don't want to live without Filibertos...

Seriously though, appreciate the awesomeness while you still live in Arizona."}
{"text":"Listen, I've written enough reviews about the many Filiberto's across the valley that I would be regurgitating old stuff over and over again. Seriously though, I've been to about 5 of them in AZ, and after moving to Boston I'm kind of hoping that AZ might be willing to donate me a Filiberto's. 

There is nothing like it anywhere. I used to be skeptical about this place, but then I tried it, and I've been addicted since. Sadly enough, because of my closed mind, I only got to have it for the last 3 out of the 22 years I was in Phoenix.

If you're a snob who likes to eat arugula salads with steamed fish or some other healthy food, don't come here. If you're a Chipotle snob, don't come here. Don't get me wrong, I love Chipotle, but Filiberto's is just different."}
{"text":"Whether you're craving a breakfast burrito, or you have a late night hunger attack for carne asada fries, Filiberto's is open 24 hours a day to meet your quickie Mexican food needs. They have various combos and a good selection of various foods and meats, with even some vegetarian options. Service is usually pretty speedy here, and the salsa bar is usually stocked well with various salsas, pickled jalapenos, and lovely pickled carrots."}
{"text":"I have to say I frequent this location once a week and for years I've never had one issue. The food is amazing. I originally was going to give 5 stars until they increased the prices. For that they only get 4 stars.

Pro-tip: Go inside and get a burrito punch card so that you can get a free burrito after buying a few."}
{"text":"The roots run deep with this Filibertos. My friends and I have had some good times here. I miss watching people ruin their front bumper in the drive thru when hitting the median. Good times...unfortunately they made that impossible now. Anyways onto the food. It's hard to explain why the food tastes better at this location. Basically it is because the grill and fryers have seen some shit over the years. The newer filibertos are good don't get me wrong. They just haven't seen the same wear and tear as this location. This place is as ghetto as they come, but damn is the food delicious. I'm not feeling the price difference though over all the thee location.  Shoot the one on Pecos I can get a bean and cheese burrito for $3.23 plus $.50 off every time so it's always under 3 bucks. Wednesdays it is $1. At this Elliot location it was over $4 for a BEAN AND CHEESE BURRITO. Get real filibertos. 3 stars for nostalgia and better tasting food, but you're lucky you get that. I'm sticking to the Pecos location."}
{"text":"They don't deserve any stars. The outside is dirty and trashy.  It never looked like that when it was Taco Bell. I should have gone next door to Taco Bell at that point. This was my first time going to a Filabertos ever. Since moving here in 09. I've seen it listed many times on Dirty Dining. I stayed away because of that. I found out that they had fish tacos and didn't want to drive that far so I gave them a try. The first bite I couldn't bite through the fish!  I look at it and some of it was brown!  I pulled on it and this long piece ripped out of it. I'm not exaggerating any of this. I took an end of this strip that ripped out in each hand. It STRETCHED LIKE A RUBBER BAND AND WENT BACK!  I called them and asked to speak to a manager. First the girl says, I can't.  Then she says he is not available. I insisted I wanted a manager. Then she says there are only 2 people there so she would help me. I told her what happened. Then asked her if she ever saw fish stretch. Her reply,  \"Not really. \" Has she ever seen fish outside of that place? I told her she needs to throw that fish out before someone gets really sick. She then said, \"You need to call back in the morning after 9:15 and talk to the manager. He can help you. I can't help you.\" UGH!  I bet they will argue with me or make up a reason it was like rubber. I made a video of me stretching it! I WILL NEVER EVER EAT THERE AGAIN!  It was my first and my last time!"}
{"text":"Wow - I am super sleepy! That is a frequent occurrence when I eat at a Filly B's. It must be the magical combination of tortilla, meat and grease or perhaps a secret ingredient that makes me feel this way - but within 20 minutes I am ready for a nap. It is a struggle when I go for lunch, but just write the day off if I get a breakfast burrito in the morning!

This location is new, replacing Moe's a few months ago. The store is clean and the staff friendly. The food arrives quickly. I think it is a good portion for the price. I get a number 2 (taco & burrito combo) and I have never been able to finish it. The chips and salsa are free (I go with the tomatillo) and drink refills are free.  The rating would be a little higher perhaps, if not for the 60 cent surcharge for using your debit card.

If you are having trouble sleeping, come get a burrito here - it isn't just me. I have taken live sample surveys of people I know and they all are sleepy after eating Filbertos. Sweet dreams!"}
{"text":"Yuck. How can any Mexican joint have absolutely no flavor in their meat? I really wanted to like this since it's close by and I'm all about 24 hour fast food! Bummer."}
{"text":"Worst carne asada burrito I have ever ate. Felt like I was just eating fat and stringy pieces. Was so grossed out that I couldn't finish it. I will never go back to this location. Gross! 

Ordered on 7/22/17 @7:20pm"}
{"text":"The food was delicious and pleasant service was wonderful!  They even let us sample the red sauce chicken so we could decide if we wanted it!  It was very good!"}
{"text":"Great spot to get your Mexican food fix, good verity of options to chose from that won't break the bank. Fast friendly service, clean and well maintained building ."}
{"text":"I still love the food, but unfortunately there's a bigger problem.  Only pay in cash.  I used my debit one evening recently and when my bank posted the purchase, the attendant at the drive through had added an extra $5 to the purchase.  Receipt was for $13.83 and got debited $18.83.  Can't abide a thief."}
{"text":"Every table was dirty, the salsa bar needed to be refilled, and the Coke syrup was out. There was absolutely nobody else in the restaurant. What else could they possibly be doing. Very disappointed. Would rather drive further away to a different location."}
{"text":"This Filiberto's was very clean & modern.  The staff was helpful & pleasant.  The food was really good too.  All I can say is you have to order the carne asada fries.  They are like nothing I've ever had in my life!  Would def. come back here again."}
{"text":"Usually my stop before heading into my account if I am working the night shift.  The food is a'ight.  I usually just get a bean and cheese burrito and often find that the cheese isn't melted.  Which is crazy that it isn't warmer considered how long the wait is."}
{"text":"Ordered the green chili burro, and got a giant tortilla filled with rice and two small chunks of pork.  See the picture.  A pathetic attempt to rip their customers off.  Never again."}
{"text":"This place is right by my house, so I want desperately to like it. But, every time I order the bacon burrito, it has an absurd abundance of bacon in proportion to the egg. Yes, amazingly enough, you can have too much bacon. I've tried asking for light bacon, but it does not seem to make a difference. I've given them about 15 chances-I'm done."}
{"text":"Good for fast food Mexican food, better then Taco Bell that's for sure. Fast friendly service. Not bad if I'm hurry and craving Mexican."}
{"text":"Look, I'm not proud of how often I go to Filiberto's. Being in Arizona I should be eating at legit Mexican restaurants or something... But burritos aren't even a thing in Mexico, so I'll just treat this as an ambiguously ethnic treat. 

I always get the veggie burrito. Delicious refried beans, rice, guacamole, lettuce, and onion. I soak it in the green sauce for a little extra flavor/heat. The red sauce they offer is \"meh,\" so just skip that one and ask for double green. The burrito is only $5 something and huge. 

Unfortunately, this particular  location is extremely slow. Sometimes I wonder if Filiberto is the only one back there. Even so, the cashiers are always polite and friendly. 

Side note: one time I got some chips with my meal and they were just out of the fryer. Yum!"}
{"text":"So I'm from Oregon, so keep that in mind, but I've been here half a dozen time and have always enjoyed the food, especially the tacos. It's a \"stand up and order place\" with fresh food, great salsa bar, self serve soda machine, no mystery meat!, etc.  If Filberto's was in the PNW, it would make a mint and I'd be 40lbs heavier."}
{"text":"Fast friendly service at 5:30 am.  Breakfast burrito was made just as I ordered, and even more important....tasted great!"}
{"text":"This location is horrible! They make tiny burritos and it's not worth it. The cashier explained to us that this location was bought by an Indian family that are very cheap and try to save money any way they can so they make the burritos at this location half the size of any other location. Often times beans are cold and taste as if they come from a can. Over seasoned meat to hide the taste of it going bad"}
{"text":"for late night food their carne asada fries are bomb! Their horchata is pretty good too!"}
{"text":"Can't beat Fili B's taco Tuesday deal!!! Their shredded beef tacos and chicken tacos are amazing and the horchata is always just right.  They aren't the nicest Mexican food place but who cares on taco tuesday!"}
{"text":"This is the place to be!  If you get a hankering for this style of Mexican food it's a no brainer.  Only the KING will get it done right.  I wish there was one by my house.

This really is KING of the bertos.  Check in for 3 free rolled tacos, if that weren't enough they have chips for free at their salsa bar!  BAM!  This is the place to be!"}
{"text":"Love the food here just hate the sauce.way to thin or water down and not hot enough.
Both the red and green.
Bur other than that awesome as always."}
{"text":"first time i ate here, they gave me chicken when i ordered beef. i had taken it to go so nothing i could do.

just ate here again for lunch, now i feel . . . kinda high or drunk or something. almost hallucinogenic . . . and not in a good way. though the toilet did just help me feel better."}
{"text":"I was really excited to try out their shrimp burritos as rumored to be the best on the menu. To my surprise, the foods saltier than anybody when mad. Including my hubby that ordered their #4; rice was tough and old, beans were salty and bitter. Do not recommend this place, your health is at risk."}
{"text":"It's Filbertos. Ya, it isn't the best Mexican food in history, but it is good late night food with big quantity on all dishes. Haters of such places like to compare with sit down authentic Mexican places, but let's be honest it is what it is and it's better than Los favs. It's good late night Mexican food.

Prices are reasonable for the amount of food you get and the late night availability. The people at this location are nice and move the line pretty quick. Bottom line is that it's the best option for late night Mexican, and certainly better than any late night pizza options available. 

Folks who complain otherwise only prove they are wrong by continuing to patronize this 24 hour thriving and expanding franchise."}
{"text":"I ordered a bean burro and got the three rolled tacos for free, plus Guac on the side. Everything was really yummy, it's a dirty fast food hole in the wall. They have really yummy salsas. It just wasn't any different than any other of the 'bertos' you'll find in the Phoenix area."}
{"text":"Kenny L. has been obsessed with Carne Asada fries since forever. 

Seriously.

I've heard the glory of carne asada fries and the need to go to San Diego to get them for must of the 4 years we've dated.

For the uninitiated, carne asada fries are like cheese fries with carne asada on top. Or nachos made with fries. It's an easy enough concept, but we haven't see it any place lately.

So when we were in PHX for a wedding and stopped into Filiberto's for a snack, he was thrilled to see Carne Asada fries on the menu. And I was thrilled to have his multi-year craving satisfied for a while.

The fries were good - crispy, not soggy under the load of the toppings. The meat was flavorful, and with the salsas, it became delicious.

The space is nothing special. I think it's probably been 5 different restaurants, and the current owners didn't make any improvements. But the food is good. 

And they had Kenny L's beloved carne asada fries."}
{"text":"THIS LOCATION DESERVES NO STARS. 

I have never gone to this one after my horrible experience!
I stop by to get a burrito after work and as I drive up they do not look busy as no one is in the drive thru great right? But I do notice 2 workers outside with their headsets on and cigarettes in their hands. As I pull into the drive thru they run back in to do their jobs. Service was ok...(ordering) takes a long time like and other fillibertos.

When I finally made it home I opened my burrito and it reeked of cigarettes (they clearly did not take the time to wash their hands) and I cut my burrito in half because the food is so much I like to each half now half later. 

I take my first bite and a long string of curly black hair is in my mouth. I was horrified and wanted to throw up! I called complained and return my food for a return. They didn't seem to care that I was upset and defended themselves saying no one that works there smokes??? 

I was baffled. They are ghetto and the people and the workers do not care. I will NEVER go there EVER. 35th and southern location is much better. Laveens customer service sucks!"}
{"text":"Filibertos is the most garbage Mexican food you can find. Good luck."}
{"text":"Horrible I found a piece of what I think is a rubber glove finger in my taco worst experience when I called they did not care didn't even say they were sorry for what happened and to call back tomorrow because there was no manager in... Beware"}
{"text":"Horrible! We always eat here and it's usually good but this time they got the order all wrong I had them remake it then I found a piece of rubber of some sort in my taco I litterly vomited on my plate when I seen what it was I called them and all they said was call back or come in tomarrow because there is no manager.... They need to be more sanitary never going back again"}
{"text":"I dunno what the gripes are about...this fast food establishment seems to meet all our needs. They have this grilled chicken salad called the 'Filo Salad', it is wonderful. For under seven bucks, even dining out, I have never got this much meat on a salad with super fresh greens. It isn't just the meat, it's the quality, cook and char. They didn't skip a beat. I love their green sauce and my boyfriend does too. I got him hard shell ground beef tacos again the other night, he loved them. They were cooked perfectly, had a good amount of meat and abundant cheese. Not to leave out the fact they provide great customer service and yes, repetitive, best green sauce!!!. Tacos are cheap on Tuesday, otherwise they are not. That being said, great food and service :)"}
{"text":"This location is my favorite in Arizona. They do a great job at keeping the inside clean and they also have a great outdoor patio area where you can eat. If you want to be experimental you can which is great. I have gone and tried something new that last four times and I am happy every single time. In fact this last visit I tried the carnitas burrito and I was wowed! The carnitas had so much flavor probably the best I've had ever. My family ordered a few different things off the menu and just shared everything. My husband ordered menudo, I ordered the California burrito and my kids ordered the carnitas burrito. All three were delicious. We are in and the service was great as well our food came out quickly and it was extremely fresh. My favorite part is the salsa bar, grab the red sauce it's best paired with their burritos"}
{"text":"Just got home a few minutes ago & I feel like throwing up. Definitely feel like I'll get sick tonight , I ordered tacos de cabeza & it was just terribly unseasoned & fatty. Most tacos have little pieces of fat here & there but these were 2 inch cubes of fat. I can't even explain how bad it is right now I'm pretty pissed the only good thing was the horchata"}
{"text":"AVOID this store and if you don't have a choice just buy your food from the next restaurant - Pete's Fried Fish!

My wife and I decided to buy lunch from this location through their drive thru. I gave my order through their intercom. We drove to the window to pay and after this guy returned my credit card I asked him for something and I WAS STILL TALKING HE IMMEDIATELY CLOSED HIS WINDOW - HOW RUDE! Their food is not good as other Filiberto's, the lemon they gave me has MOLDS! Save yourself and go somewhere else!

Definitely will not go back to this place!"}
{"text":"We ordered the carne asada burrito, carnitas tortas, and carne asada fries. They all looked appealing, but looks can be deceiving. All three were pretty tasteless. Both the green hot sauce and red sauce had NO spicy kick or taste at all.   The only positive I can say is that the inside of the restaurant was generally clean and the workers were very nice.  I don't anticipate visiting this location anytime soon."}
{"text":"Went there tonight, Monday night. Ordered 3 orders of rolled tacos which are $1.19 for an order of three on Mondays. Asked for guacamole on them expecting to pay extra. When I got to the window, they had charged me $1.49 per order for the guacamole. Last Monday it was $.60 an order which is what the difference on the posted menu is. I asked the guy about it, but got nothing. So let them keep there tacos, and I will not spend anymore money with them."}
{"text":"Went thru the drive-thru. placed my order, it was repeated back to me correctly, and told the amount. Pulled forward and paid the amount asked for, and waited for my order. Received my order bagged up, and drove off. Got home and found they had only given me 1/3 of my order. Called and asked to speak to the manager, and was told they were too busy and would call me back. Only to find out the manager wasn't even there at 4PM. Was told I could get in my car and drive the 3 miles back to the store and get the rest of my order. They said they would give me some store coupons, which they give out anyway, for the inconvenience. So I could spend more money with them and give them another opportunity to screw-up another order. I now understand why there was no other customers there."}
{"text":"Very good place to eat , pretty expensive  but really filling depending on what you get, I always get the carne asada fries  and they are very good"}
{"text":"I've been eating at this Filiberto's for years and they just keep getting better. Their staff is usually right on the money with my orders, even when I have custom requests and I'm not sure if they heard me right :) Their ground beef (molida) is amazing and their 99 cent ground beef tacos are huge and delicious, and way better than what you get for the same price at the Taco Bell right up the road. Their Patron burrito is very good and filling, full of meat for the carb-conscious and very well priced for what you get. It's stuffed with steak, bacon and carnitas with monterey jack cheese and some pico de gallo. In the last couple of weeks they replaced their aging menu board and order speaker and have added a couple of new items that I've been obsessed with. The Gordo burrito is a mix of steak, chicken and shrimp and is very tasty. The Big Juan burrito is enormous! It comes with your choice of carne asada (steak) or pollo asado (grilled chicken) and included bacon, beans, rice, guacamole, sour cream, cheese, and pico de gallo all wrapped in a double tortilla. The first two times I ordered it I got the pollo asada which was very good, but this last time I ordered carne asada and they hooked me up with the biggest burrito I'd ever eaten. This burro is definitely a two-fister and enough calories to keep me satisfied for most of the day."}
{"text":"Good chips and salsa.  I usually order a burrito and taco combo.  I love the shredded meat in both.  I hate when you get chewy pieces at some resteraunts but they never seem to have this problem.  Rice and beans are also good.  For a \"fast food\" place they have really good food.  Good prices too, I always have leftovers for lunch the next day which is just an added bonus.  I think I might hit their drive-thru on the way home tonight...yum!"}
{"text":"I have always been a fan of Filiberto's but this place sucks! The tacos are expensive and they put about a quarter of the amount of meat as other locations.  Went twice in case they just had a mishap but it was the exact same way. Will not be going back. Oh and the beans and rice had no flavor at all! Very disappointing.  Boo"}
{"text":"The food is really good. It's unfortunate they have such poor service. The atmosphere felt very un-inviting. We walked in on a Sunday around 3pm and most of the chairs were up on the tables it felt as if was a bit of a bother to have people find in. Like I said unfortunate :/"}
{"text":"The food is pretty good compared to the other locations. The only thing is the quac is old and taste like a mushy banana (In my bfs exact words, now that's all I taste when I eat it). But otherwise it's not bad. The 2 stars is for the awful service, drive thru takes forever no matter what time of day!! I finally went inside to see if it was any different (it's just as bad or worse). It was a little quicker but the two ladies (one was wearing a choker and earrings which I'm pretty sure is not allowed when handling food- the other was the manager) anyways I was not greeted i walked up and made eye contact with the girl in the choker and she literally looked at me and walked away then went to her manager. They talked for like a minute and she came back and just said \"are you ready?\" I ordered my food and waited. A minute later the manager acknowledges me and just asks if I needed something."}
{"text":"Our friend recomended this place to us....and told us it was good........

At least for us that was completely way off.....

So my food was ok..not saying much though..I had a beef burrito and a enchilada with beans and rice.....everything was bland...it tasted like something I'd get from a grocery store.......

My wife got the chicken burrito and it had nothing but chicken in it..no lettuce or condoments like tomatoes and veggies...straight up chicken and melted cheese.....looked pretty gross to me...

Customer service wasn't any better......Only 2 people working...one of which is the only one we saw....took a while to get their attention with a service bell that doesn't even work...they were nice...but nice doesn't cut it...

The dining area was very dirty with cracked floors and dirty tables......its sad that I'd rather just go to Taco Bell..was hoping for better Mexican food......

I can't say I would recommend.....just go to Taco Bell honestly....either that or make your own mexican food....I'm willing to bet you could do better......"}
{"text":"love this location they always get my order right i have been to other locations but my family ends up getting sick but this location is the best we usually come 3 times a week"}
{"text":"Absolutely disgusting. My fish tacos were greasy & the \"sauce\" must have gone bad last week. And honestly it sucks walking into a place & the staff acts like they don't want u there. 
Will never eat this OVER PRICED CRAP again. YUCK."}
{"text":"Great Mexican food, get the Carne asada burrito enchilada style. The super nachos are awesome too."}
{"text":"First time eating here. I just ordered the adobada fries (yes, you can do that). Most places allow you to sub out the often dry, unseasoned carne asada for the more flavorful adobada (pork). It makes a world of difference. Anyways, back to the review. I just ordered the fries and an horchata. The fries were very good and the meat cooked perfectly. Only complaint is that I wish they threw in a lime or 2. Most places put a lime wedge in with the fries. Not a big deal. I just assumed they did and didnt ask when they asked if I wanted salsa. I went drive-thru so I didnt find out til later, otherwise it wouldve been a non-issue. 

The horchata was also very good, not watered down like another review claims. Maybe they changed their recipe? Maybe that person just went on a day when a new guy was making it? Or maybe I just got lucky. Who knows, but it was good, and I consider myself a bit of an horchata connoisseur. *nose up*

But to make an unnecessarily long story short, I am very satisfied with the food and will be returning soon."}
{"text":"Best cheap Mexican fast food. Better service than at the Az Biltmore (where we stayed). Bills much cheaper. I would come back for fizzle. 
Carne Assad's burrito. Green chili burrito quesadilla. It's all upper class at poor mans prices"}
{"text":"Always friendly, fast service here at this location. It's on my way from work so it's always convenient if I want a quick bite through the drive thru.

Food is always on point, always have to get an order or 3 rolled tacos and an horchata no matter what! 

5/5"}
{"text":"When they gave us our order, which was green chili plate, half of it was cold. We asked if we could exchange it with something else and we would pay extra and they refused. We asked for the persons name who refused to exchange it out and then also refused this. While eating the plate we found hair in the rice and showed the employee and then she said she can't believe us now. When they first opened they were great. The employees they have now are worthless for the $10 an hour they are getting paid to mess up our food. We will never come here again."}
{"text":"Love this location! Service is great, food always exceptional, the drive though experience is awesome. When I'm ready for the Arizona Burrito this is the spot to be! 
Ary is awesome too!"}
{"text":"I really like this place.  I think it is better than some sit down Mexican restaurants. I love there burritos"}
{"text":"Let me start this off correctly: this is, by no means, a fine Mexican dining establishment. Going to FillyB's is less about the food and more about the experience. Well, I'd be lying if I told you that I don't crave the carne asada fries from time to time here. 

At end of the day, though, this is your typical late night munchies spot that is open ridiculously late and always has decent food. It's not the cheapest, it's not the fastest, but it's definitely a staple and something you need to experience after a long night. You haven't truly lived in Tempe if you don't have any great stories that ended with you at Filibertos. Just do it, but don't expect too much."}
{"text":"NOT 24 HOURS!!!!! They leave their drive thru menu lights on but no one's home. Sad.

You would think they'd shut out the lights! 

Also, the filiberto's website is HORRID. It doesn't list phone #'s or HOURS!!! HELLLLLOOOOOOO??????"}
{"text":"Stupid lady at the drive thru... I told her 3 times at drive thru and at window, I wanted BEEF enchiladas number 5... She charged me for BEEF... Then I got my order, went to work...  And at work, they were the crappy flat cheese enchiladas. Stupid idiot... Nothing but morons that work here"}
{"text":"Weird version of rice and chicken.... Tempe location is always on point. Thought I'd try this new location but that was a mistake :/"}
{"text":"I decided to visit this location for the 1st time last week & all went well(good food, service, etc). I received a coupon from a local mailer(discount on particular item), so I decided to return tonight for dinner. 

Again it started off well with good service, but quickly turned negative once I presented my coupon. The employees first did not know how to enter discount into register, began to speak in Spanish in front of me & became rude. I asked to add sour cream to my item which was charged, but not put on item. It seemed to me that my order was also passed over by customers who ordered after me(bean & cheese burrito) as I waited quite some time for order to finish. 

It is not my fault as a customer that you as employees are not informed about company promotions or how to enter those into your register(that's your boss's job). What I don't appreciate is rudeness & especially when you start speaking Spanish to each other once there is a customer issue when you were just speaking perfect English(as I don't speak spanish). 

Needless to say I won't be spending a dime at your company going forward. #America"}
{"text":"The food here has always been delicious! They do seem to run out of jamaica and my favorite jarritos a lot, but besides for that I've had really good service."}
{"text":"Disgusting. Can't even make a beef taco properly. Tortilla is all soggy and the taco is dripping in oil. I can literally squeeze the oil out of the tacos."}
{"text":"Unhappy, cold food. Half the time there is unfriendly clerk charging different pricing. Cheese did not even melt on rolled tacos and the guacamole is on the right side so you can't pick them up! Apparently every one is left handed. 2-3 years and still can't get their act together. What a shame!!!"}
{"text":"I've been to half the Filibertos in Phx since the first one opened. While living on the East Coast I yearned for a late night Fili run and would do so whenever visiting. 
I've moved back and been to this location at Gilbert and Baseline and foolishly keep going back. Here are my grievances:
Prices way up
Quality so so (usually just a bean and cheese burrito, but cold and for $4.03?)
Attitude. C'mon. It's Filibertos. Don't judge me at the counter.

Bottom line is, two bean burritos with cheese and a medium drink for $12.50? I may as well be in NYC. And then the attitude. Just don't need it. I'll hit Ricardos up the road. :)

I'll keep hitting Filis here and there but this one is finally gone over the top and lost me. They just don't care. There are plenty of folks driving thru and their tills are running over. Clearly there is no pressing need to maintain a charade of friendly service to mix with their high-priced fast food."}

I asked for her franchise office number she kept my receipt and said she can't give it out and wrote down my info and said someone will call me, worse service ever! They need new management"}
{"text":"I was driving home from work when all of a sudden I started feeling dizzy, this reminded me that I had not eaten all day!
I decided to stop here and get a couple of carne asada tacos and an horchata.
The price they have for the tacos vs what they charge is different.
The horchata was good, the tacos were not. They were blah, definitely not carne asada flavor.
I didn't even finish them.
Next time drive a little further and go to Tacos Chiwas."}
{"text":"I'm a nice guy. I'm very polite when I order, but tonight I had a very rude woman take my order and hand me my food. First off, she did not give me any hot sauce despite me  requesting it. Second, I ordered a bean and cheese burrito. I added rice as I always do and I decided to spice it up and add a little onion and cilantro to it. Bad idea. My burrito had what appeared to be three stalks of cilantro inside of it. Not to mention a whole white onion put into the burrito. There was very little bean and cheese and rice.  All I got was onions and cilantro. I get it, maybe it was an annoying burrito to order but I feel like I was polite and that's not that crazy of a burrito to order. There's nothing worse than craving something all night and finally going to get it and have it be the most disappointing thing ever. I used to come here all the time and I stoped because the food was so bad. I gave it another chance and the last two months, it's been great. But after tonight, I'm sorry to say I will no longer be coming to this location ever again. That was the most disappointing, disgusting burrito I've ever had in my life. And I eat a lot of burritos."}

First of all, my order was messed up (I got the complete wrong item AND I was over charged!) so I call to let them know, they say to come back.. Get there and they wouldn't even fix the order let alone refund my money.... So I call, ask for a manager & some pubescent kid tried to fight with me over the phone about how it all went down.. I'm sorry but that's NOT customer service! I will NEVER(and everyone I know), ever spend another dollar at a Filiberto's \"restaurant\" again.... And you shouldn't either!"}
{"text":"WOW!!! What RUDE staff! She told us our total was $5 and some change THEN when we get to the window it changed to $8 and some change! She got pissed off after we said we didn't want our food and literally just closed the window in our face! I WILL be calling the manager AND corporate. I hope you lose your job! Learn to treat people with respect!"}

{"text":"Twice I've been to Filiberto's. The first time the restaurant was quiet but the food was pretty good, not too bad. The second time the restaurant was quiet I was the only customer at the time that I ordered, and I had to wait a little while for my food, and several other customers entered the restaurant. Filiberto's restaurants in general could use a facelift, especially the one I visited today. The color combinations of paint don't do the restaurant very well and especially the hole in the wall that look like somebody had punched it. If management took time to invest in their business, and invest in their employees, their food product is good enough that it could actually become quite good with the right management style. As it is now I only gave them one star because really there's a lot of work that needs to be done and that work needs to happen quickly or they're not going to be able to afford to stay in business for a long time."}
{"text":"DO NOT go here if you're a vegetarian. My \"country breakfast burrito\" (supposed to be potatoes, egg & cheese) had five pieces of sausage in it. FIVE. How does that even happen?? This has happened at least 4-5 times (our office is close and the boss picks up breakfast burritos, I don't have a choice) and there is no consistency in their food. This burrito today had basically no cheese. Other times there's way too many potatoes and not enough eggs. This location SUCKS!!!!!!!"}

{"text":"I've been eating Filiberto's for so many years and I always ordered the carna asada burrito. I never finish it cuz the size is always huge. 
Long story short, I ordered a carna asada nutrition from them the other night. And found out it was a mini sized burrito. Probably as 1/3 of the original size. 
Are you kidding me? Lol
Me No Happy!"}
{"text":"i love the \"bertos\" locations. it is a major plus for living in the valley. As far as late-night food, there is no comparison. All of the breakfast burritos are superior."}
{"text":"My super close, local taco shop. For me, consistency is key, and Filiberto's is always a step above most other restaurants ending with \"to's\" in that regard.  I'm fairly mental for their Chicken Soft Tacos on corn tortillas. Larger than a typical street taco, they are almost sized more like a mini burrito - Shredded Chicken, a red pepper sauce, lettuce, and melted cheddar = AWESOME. Tuesdays they are only $1, all day!  Finally their Adobada tacos are a bargain at thrice the price. Avoid the Chili Relleno burrito, however. It may be one of the worst things to ever get passed through a drive-thru window."}
{"text":"I'm getting a stomach ache just thinking about Filibertos.

This place is widely considered a \"drunk munchie\", and for good reason. You really never *want* Filibertos in a clear state of mind. Let's be honest here:

~ The service is nothing to write home about, they take your order, ring you up, serve your food, badda bing you're done with 'em.
~ The drive-thru is very awkward. You basically have to order, pull a U-turn, and then aim yourself into the narrow pick-up drive thru on the other side of this very small building (separate from the plaza). I swear every time I come here, I almost get hit by some Passat-driving sorority squad leader maneuvering through the lot trying to get to Pita Jungle.
~ The food, although decent in comparison to nearby Taco Bell, is very homogeneous.

But there are some great things about Filibertos:

~ Right off the light rail.
~ Walk up window (don't drink and drive, people).
~ Consistent in all aspects.
~ Always open (I think).

All in all, this place is simply okay. Don't overeat it, though."}
{"text":"I got a carne asada burrito today for lunch and it was COLD!  The meat was cold and the tortilla was cold. This is the second time I have received poor quality food from this location.  Not going to happen again!
At least reheat your leftovers before serving them."}
{"text":"Absolutely, positively the worst food, Mexican or otherwise I have ever tried to eat.
Overpriced, flavorless and stale, the entire order should have been relegated to the dumpster, not served to a customer.
I ordered 2 beef tacos at $3.00 each. They do not come with any condiments (condiments are sold separate at a buck a piece!) such as taco sauce, sour cream or guacamole. They do give you a few tiny plastic containers each holding about 2 tablespoons of reddish colored water..mystery to me what they were as I was not brave enough to taste them. The taco filling consists of a tablespoon or so of stewed mystery meat which is flavorless, a few shreds of some limp partially melted process shredded cheese, and a few shreds of limp and browned lettuce all of which lie sadly in a tiny strip at the bottom of the overcooked taco shell. The shell itself was disgustingly flavored by the rancid cooking oil it was prepared with and was not only stale but overcooked...hard as a brick. My best guess is that the last time they changed the oil in their fryers, Texas was still part of Mexico.
No lie, my DOG turned his nose up at it when he sniffed at the trash...which is where my entire order ended up.

Next was a beef burrito served up in a stale, flavorless flour tortilla. The edges were hard as a rock and the middle was raw and doughy. 
The meat (again) is stewed and with absolutely no flavor at all, bland, bland, bland with a few sickly looking  strips of fried green pepper and onion mixed in. No beans, cheese, rice, lettuce, tomato or condiment...for $4.99 no less.

I lived in California among many Mexican families and am very familiar with authentic Mexican food which this restaurant is an insult to. My advice is to save your money and go to Taco Bell rather than visit this mexican dumpster. If I could give a negative star rating, I surely would!"}
{"text":"The food is ok here but it has to be the slowest filiberto  I've been to. The service is only so so"}
{"text":"This was the first Filiberto's I ate at 24 years ago and it's still the best location.  The quality & quantity food at this location hasn't changed."}
{"text":"Love the food here it is my guilty pleasure. Rolled tacos with cheese and guacamole, you can't go wrong."}
{"text":"New place in Fountain Hills and a very good one! Great value and very good food! They have a salsa bar but most are somewhat flavorless and lack punch I think something with heat would be a good addition. I have been here twice now and it seems the opening problems are resolved. 
Good service, good food and a friendly staff!"}
{"text":"Pretty good. Quick service too...I always appreciate that. I am always in a hurry and they get me in and out. They are also always friendly. Thanks for providing great service!"}
{"text":"This Is Without A Doubt My Favorite Filib's In Mesa Lol! Food Is Always On Point And Cheese Is Always Melted In My Burrittos lol (Pet Peeve)"}
{"text":"This is one of the better Filley B's, but for some reason prices seem to keep hovering higher and higher. I had 3 tacos, a water cup, and a side of sour cream, and it was just over $10. No joke, this is unacceptable especially when they are going up against a Taco Bell right next door. Yes, there is a free salsa bar but side condiments such as scour cream are around $1.50 while most tacos are over the $2.50 price point. Do I have $10 for dinner? Of course, but I have a gripe with the value proposition offered here at FB's.

I guess the higher prices for homey and basic Mexican food are offset by free chips and lemon wedges in the water? 

How was the food? Big portions, basic flavors, served quick and piping hot. 2 of their carnitas tacos have as much protein as a burrito bowl at Chipotle. They are served with a fresh yet cilantro heavy pico, and a dollop of low end processed guac. Yes there is a bit of grease, but you won't be chowing down in to chunks of fat. I love the salsa bar has the spicy pickled carrot mixture known as escabeche, I always chow down a few slices as I wait for my food, but wait times have always been speedy. The standout salsa was a darker green, with more heat than the traditional light green and heavier garlic and onion notes. Maybe some labels would be nice?

So TL;DR? Basic but well executed. My meal was still $2-3 overpriced. Some decent fringe benefits and quirky atmosphere."}
{"text":"This place is right by my house so it's always convenient for me but the service here is horrible. Nothing but rude ass people. I'm sorry but if you hate working there so much then go find a new job!!!! I'll return once the workers learn how to fix their attitude or new people are hired."}
{"text":"Decent food and prices, but there are other places nearby that provide higher quality at a lower price."}
{"text":"Like Filibertos but this particular restaurant is horrible.  20 minute wait this morning for a to go order when the place wasn't even busy.  On top of the wait, they got the order wrong!  Unfortunately this is not the first time I have had issues at this location."}
{"text":"The food here was pretty good and we even took the burritos for the nice gentle men that were helping us with the fence but the thing that we hated from them was that there was way too much grease inside the tacos, and they even gave our that we order and gave it to someone else who ordered the same thing. And the tacos we got from them had nearly half filled with grease. I wouldn't go to this establishment for a while until they fix their \"grease\" problem."}
{"text":"Bad customer service. They don't greet you the right way , they act as if you're taking forever to order. Oh and the drive thru. Yeah it pretty much sucks. They need a new speaker. Food is great. People there are just horrible!"}
{"text":"This location (Dobson & Elliot) was one of the first Filiberto's to open in the valley.  I believe (not 100% sure) but it could be the original.  Anyways, this place has changed my life.  The first time I had it was 13 years ago, I was 13 yrs old and in junior high (Hendrix Jr. High stand up!!).  My buddies and I would save our lunch money and come here after school.  A good friend of mine asked me if I like guacamole....ignorant to what it was I replied \"no.\"  Little did I know that this \"guac\" would change my palate forever. 

 I started off by eating carne asada.  steak, guacamole, pico de gallo, cheese in a giant, light tortilla. what's not to like?

Then I moved on to the Arizona Burrito.  steak, potatoes, cheese and pico de gallo.  Again, what's not to like?

I was later introduced to the Steak, Egg and Cheese burrito; really good, but now I always ask for this with potatoes.  Which would make it the ultimate breakfast burrito that you could eat anytime of the day.

whenever I need to switch things up, I'll order the chile relleno or the fish burrito.  I know, I know, fish burrito in AZ?  But trust me, the fish is fried to perfection and is really delicious.

If they opened up a fancy sit down restaurant and served their dishes on plates and bowls, they could easily be the best Mexican restaurants in the valley.  I kid you not, I'm a Mexican food connoisseur.  I've lived in the southwest for over 20 years and I grew up with my latino brothers.  I got this...  Other than the carne asada here, the next best would be El Pollo Supremo in Tempe (another Yelp, another day).  

Since moving to Honolulu, I've been feeling so deprived of Mexican food.  People could hate on Filiberto's all day, but they are only fooling themselves...Filiberto's is KING in Mexican take out."}
{"text":"If I could rate this place 0 I would....watch every bite of your food closely you may find a little creature in your food...and they will do nothing about it except take your food back and not refund you and tell you to get lost...RUDEST PEOPLE EVER!!"}
{"text":"Came here for a midnight snack since this place is near my boyfriend's place and opened until 3am! He ordered the Lengua burrito with the green hot sauce and I had a large horchata. The Lengua burrito was all Lengua and some salsa! That's a whollllleee lot of meat for $7! The green sauce goes well with it and I mostly like the burrito's tortilla wrap because it was thin enough to not be the filling part of the meal. I didn't like the Horchata however because it was really diluted :/ and for $3. A good drunchies spot and late night snack."}
{"text":"We went here based on all the positive reviews. I should have lowered my expectations. We ordered chips & guac and several 99 cent tacos (fish, beef & chicken). The tacos had a hard shell which I actually like and were topped with a TON of shredded lettuce and shredded cheddar cheese. I mistakenly thought this food would resemble authentic Mexican, it did not. Cheddar cheese does not belong in the kitchen of ANY Mexican restaurant.

The beef tacos were 80% lettuce, 10% cheddar cheese and 10% meat. Seriously, where's the beef??? They give you more meat on the chicken taco. I decided not to eat my remaining beef taco, instead I gave it to my husband who ditched the lettuce, cheese and shell and added the beef to his already skimpy taco. The food was along the same line as Taco Bell. I don't dislike Taco Bell, I just prefer real Mexican food.

The guac was not bad, it was also covered in cheddar cheese."}
{"text":"I ASKED when ordering does the chimichanga come with anything on it I was told no. I get home it has half  guacamole half sour cream. I'm home open the box its screwed up tired and hungry I think ill try it. No its soggy wet and gross. If I order a chimichanga I want a crispy burrito."}
{"text":"Decided to give this place another chance and I was beyond disappointed I went through the drive thru. I order my food and I pay with my debit card. As I pay I ask the lady if I could have a horchata. As they where handing my food I ask aging if I could get an horchata and at this point it was a different lady handing me my food and said she needed to see my i.d. I ask her you need to see my i.d. for a horchata she said yes I need your i.d. at this point I was beyond irritated since no i.d. had been required to pay the meals I got with my debit card and it  was not sign on the back and it was clear I was going to pay cash for the drink I had ask for. I told her to forget it and I left. Never aging going to this place. Sadly I can't rate them lower if I could I would. Wish I could of talk to a manager but aging I'm sure no one would of done nothing about it. Makes me feel worry now that no i.d. was ask for my card. I would have to keep and eye on my bank account now."}
{"text":"I've never actually gone into this Filiberto's as the drive thru is more convenient for my lazy ass. I feel like my order always takes a long time to make. I usually get the pollo asado combo plate. I'm sure they go and kill the chickens and cook them as I'm impatiently waiting in my car starving. It's the price I pay for being lazy and only living 5 minutes away.

Red sauce is bomb."}
{"text":"Open 24 hours and has a special Monday - Friday.  Each one of those days, a certain item like taco (your choice of chicken, carne, or beef), tostada, bean burrito, quesadilla, etc.. are 99 cents.  Not a bad deal.

The beans are not runny here.  There's a chip and salsa bar with a variety of salsa (unlike the place on 1250 W. Broadway, in Tempe).

Great Carne burrito and I've never had a problem here at all."}
{"text":"Food is some of the best for a Filibertos but they move ridiculously slow."}
{"text":"Compared to a \"proper sit-down Mexican restaurant where you're waited on\", Filibertos is: 80% the taste and recipe quality (an acquired taste, some of it's greasy), 105% the menu selection (there's even more displayed on posters than what you see on the huge menu), 35% the food presentation (styrofoam), 110% the edible perks (free chips & salsa, free pickled carrots & jalopenos, free sliced cucumbers), 80% the consistency in quality (some days the shredded beef is just greasy pan scrapings), 60% the price, 15% the service quality (no waiters but cool staff, if rushed), and 5% the wait (it's faster than Taco Bell!) Open 24 hours, it has become my favorite eatery."}
{"text":"Slow, slow, service. Did I mention it's slow? The food was fine, but not worth waiting 30 minutes for it. Go somewhere else if you have a hankering for Mexican and anywhere to be soon."}
{"text":"Because I have to give a star but I take it back. The Mexican guy that handles the window is an a$shole. 
Is always rude and I not willing fix his mistakes. Avoid this place"}
{"text":"If I could give a zero I would. First off. Zero onions means no onions. So they gave me a $7.00 burrito with pico de gallo and the justification was what? When a person say no onion that means no onion. Then when I called and told them they made a mistake they hung up on me. I didn't use foul language or curse at them. I said \"no onion means no onion. No onion. So you should say your pico come with onion and put it on side or remove.\" So now I have a $7 piece of junk I can eat. Great. Yeah. You can say it in English or Spanish. No comprende on both. They will mess up cause they don't care. Good to know. I live around corner but I will never be back."}
{"text":"Fast food Mexican food.. fast service in the drive thru.. hold the food containers as they hand the bag to you and then when you get out of the car.. the containers will open and half of your food will slide out and into the bag.. not sure why and I don't have this problem at other food places ..

Prices have gone up .. they do give you a lot of food still and the quality is always about the same .. it's good for fast food, not like homemade though.

The green chili has good spice .. the green salsa is good .. the watermelon agua fresca is refreshing (not made in house).

Perfect for late nights.. open 24/7"}
{"text":"This store is the worst store in the company. I have visted filibertos stores all over the valley and have always been pleased with the food and the service. However when it comes to this location i am really taken back on how the guest are treated. I treat my dog better then they treat there guests. The sad thing is there are multiple times i have visted this location as i am a new resident to laveen and have been treated the same. They are very forgetful when u go thru the drive thru and when u bring it to there attention they are rude and will require u to provide them with the receipt even if they just charged u!? They forgot my drink and i had to get off my car and when i went in they asked me for my receipt. I walked back to my car and provided them with the receipt. She saw she did charge me rolled her eyes and walked to get it. She then handed it to me and gave to apologizes or anything . She was also no wearing a uniform. She was a heavy set lady. With a sweater  no name tag. she looked like the manager or franchise owner. I hope shes neither. There are three fast food mexican resurants in the same plaza & i will make sure to never vist this location again. I am writing this letter to not get anything free, but to make the corporate office aware on how there great name is being shamed by there terrible employees. The worst part is i reported the incident to corporate and they did not respond to my complaint. Oh well ill take my money else where."}
{"text":"Holy crap, this Filibertos is fancy!  This is the one Filibertos that is actually *like* a real rest-a-rant-ae!  Most Filibertos that I know are little shacks, some with walk ups, some with drive thru's, some with both.  This one?  Actually has TABLES and an INSIDE!  HOLY CRAP!  Amazing!

I know this place has been open for a while, but never really went to this location since there's like a zillon around town.  I came here very early this morning after doing a 3 mile walk for MS with some of my new co-workers.  Fortunately, they open early, and I was hungry!

I cruised in here and was pretty much the only person here.  Same full menu that you would get at all the other locations, but this place actually has tables and a salsa bar.  They even have an outdoor patio!  *gasp*

I ordered the macaca (I think thats how to spell it) breakfast platter and man, was it HUGE!  I mean, I'm not a huge fan of Filibertos, but they do give you tons of really good food for a really cheap price, and its filling.  I couldn't even finish it.

I like that they have this sit down location.  It's a nice change for them, and makes me feel more comfortable instead of having to carry everything out.

I will gladly return in the future when I'm in the area, and its the nicest Filibertos I've seen since living here!"}
{"text":"I have to hand it to Filiberto's, they do make some pretty tasty food at a really good price.  Thier open 24 hours, they serve breakfast all day, and gosh darn it, thier all over the place.  I can't throw a rock in this town without hitting a Filibertos.

Despite that this place is a mile from my house, its not my normal filibertos location (I hit up the one off southern instead)  I came here because I was across the street at Safeway and had a sudden urge for some tacos and rice.  I swear, service at Filberto's is slow, but this one seems to be slower then usual!  Also, its right near the end of the light rail at Main and Sycamore, so be careful with all the rail foot traffic that happens here.  Can be kinda scary at night trying to make a left on main street!

Parkings kinda tight, but if its not busy, you should be okay.  Went up to the window and got my # 3 order to go, and had it out in no time.  The drive thru sucks here, as it weaves through the parking lot, and I fear getting hit when I go through.


Anyways, foods as good as it is at other locations, and Im quite full after eating what I could and putting the rest in the fridge for later.  O, this place accepts cash and debit cards only, but if you use your debit card, theres a 60 cent charge for that, so try to pay cash....and theres only 1 outdoor table, so dont bother trying to sit and eat here!"}
{"text":"I LOVE Filiberto's!  Being that I'm a fan, I've eaten at this location before, just not for a while. I like that this one's a sit down location, as normally I go to the one's that are the walk up/drive through ones.

I ate with my friend here for dinner tonight and we both enjoyed ourselves.  I went with my usual of the two shredded tacos, dirty rice and refried beans.  Friend went with the Carne Asada fries.  Both were delicious!  Mine was a bit greasier then normal, but still was exactly what I needed.

The place was kind of dead when we were there, but it was still good none the less.  They also have a salsa bar here, which is kind of cool.  Service was okay, and the food came out hot and quick.

The only down side to this place is that the floor was super sticky in spots and could have used a good moping. I also noticed one of the booths had a tear in the vinyl seating, and hopefully it gets repaired soon. I know this place is \"just a Filly B's\" but who wants to see it go into slum status?

Anyways, even though the food was extra greasy last night, it's still my favorite food to secretly eat even though it's horrible for me!"}
{"text":"This is the cleanest, fanciest Filiberto's of all time.  I feel like I should be wearing a suit and tie when I dine here.  Where is the valet parking?

With all of its fanciness this is still Filiberto's and one five rolled taco plate doesn't differ no matter what the interior looks like.  If you are a fan of greasy food Fili B's is the place to go.  It is cheap mexican food that best hits the spot while in a state of inebriation."}
{"text":"Not the best filbertos, but not the worst. I came here because I was in the area, starving, and wanted to sit down somewhere to eat.  I got what I l always get, the #3 (2 shredded beef tacos, beans, rice and a drink.)

Not a bad experience, just blah.  There was a TV that was blaring loud with some mexican kids show on, and there was a weird crowd in here.  Food was decent, but I think I like my regular Filberto's better."}
{"text":"This Filiberto's opened a few months ago in an old Wendy's location. When I first moved in, it was vacant, but literally, over night, this place was a full blown Filiberto's.  Only in Arizona!!!  Anyways, place is full of space, clean, and for the most part, good.  It's not my favorite Filly B's, but dang it, it gets the job done!

This place has a drive through as well, along with a great salsa bar and a full menu.  Service is kind of slow, but you get your food in no time.  It's located right next to a Fry's Grocery, and I stop here from time to time for some shredded beef tacos.  Overall, I like it here, and you can get your taco fix just about any time you need. I think their 24 hours, but I'm not 100%."}
{"text":"I've driven by this Filibertos many many times, considering I live right around the corner.  I finally got around to stopping in.

At first, it looks like a mexican sonic.  seriously.  they have a walk up window, a drive through, and some tables outside to eat at.  I checked out the menu, and decided that I wanted the breakfast burrito...the Macaba or something...I got mine with shredded beef.  Holy crap was this thing big!  HUGE!  It was only $4 after tax, and I was STUFFED.  Plus, they made it while I waited in my car, so it was fresh.

I really liked it here.  I like thier menu and they have lots of options.  Prices are great, and I really feel like you get a lot of food for very reasonable prices.  No, this place is not fancy, and its basically drive through Mexican, but its tasty, and very filling."}
{"text":"So far so good Taco Tuesday's are awesome cant beat that i would definitely eat here again"}
{"text":"Drove all the way from LA for the carne Asada fries and bloody Mary's. Jk. Well...we did drive from LA. On our way to Phoenix we stop by just passing thru. Needless to say the asada fries were better than any others I could ever find back home. Service was good and drinks were just right for 11am. Great set up as well. tvs on from every angle and can be seen from any seat in the house."}
{"text":"i love filiberto's. as a hispanic American i think the good is pretty authentic for a chain restaurant. the only thing different locations vary in quality of food. this one is always busy which in my experience means the food will not be old, cold or overcooked. the only problem i've had with this location is that sometimes you can wait for a long (sometimes really long) time for your food. if you are in a hurry be aware of that..."}
{"text":"I love TACO TUESDAYS....but I will be eating my tacos from a different place. I went there last night ordered 4 tacos and chip n salsa. I have been to this location before and have had no problems...but when I opened the container of chips n salsa I discovered they had put the SALSA on top of the CHIPS!! WHY??? Now they are SOGGY chips. I have ordered chips n salsa from other places they have never done this so I would have never thought to ask them to not do it.

The tacos were lacking chicken on both ends of the shell. So the first bite and last bite are shell only....well at least something was CRUNCHY!!

I called them when I got home and because it was late there was no manager and the two ladies I spoke to were UNABLE to understand me. I don't speak Spanish!!"}
{"text":"Perhaps the best Filiberto's in town certainly superior to the any rivals around it. It may seem silly to rate a fast food joint that is part of a franchise but unlike Macdonald's, Wendy's, In and Out, etc. Filibertos are not all equal and it is important to know which berto's to go to at 3am; the one 3 miles west of your home or the one 3 miles north of your home.

But in general Filiberto's is well known among Phoenix locals, although everyone stands on either one extreme end of the spectrum or the other. For those who share my love for 24 hour taqueria this the best the north valley has to offer. 

For those of you that are new to filiberto's and are perhaps just visiting the valley for short time or are moving to one of our great cities i would use this rule: Treat Filibertos food like you would the tap water in Mexico avoid it if you aren't going to be around that long but if you are here for the long haul give it a few chances to let your stomach acclimate then enjoy."}
{"text":"I've gotten breakfast burritos from this Filiberto's several times and they are always a good size/portion, hot/fresh and taste good.

The service was good and the price was about average for what I ordered.

Really more like a 3.5 star review but I have been eating at Filiberto's for almost 20 years and never had a problem. I felt they deserved the four stars for that consistency!"}
{"text":"I got a few things on the menu since I was rather famished, and I was truly unimpressed. 

Sadly, none of their salsas have any real kick to em, disappointed. Their steak n egg burrito was 7 dollars and it bloated the hell out of me. Their meat is so bland for Christ sake. Do they even season it? Well that's what I get for choosing this location. It's just frustrating when you spend money and you receive a product that is sub-par. 

Their carne asada fries? Just a grease ball of questionable meat with some potato product. I was a bit disheartened with my overall  experience.

I'm not saying the food is the worst, I'm saying that it has been tried and proven to be lacking in flavor and quality. 

END"}
{"text":"Like most Filiberto's, the food is great. Better then even the most fancy places and this is why I give it 3 stars. Where it fails is how dirty and run down the place is. The container where they keep their chips in, looks as if it has not been washed since the place opened.  

The tables where dirty an while there, the entire time nobody came out to clean them. The food my be good, but I don't want to think about all the bacteria in this place."}
{"text":"There are many filly B's but this is my favorite.  The best cheap Mexican food you can find, they have a menu that meets anyone's tastes, and it's authentic, fast, down and dirty Mexican food.  Just getting out of the bar, you need you some Filly B's stat.

it is what it is, don't let anyone fool, you.  This is the real deal."}
{"text":"I love this place. I just paid $8.19 for my combo plate. I used a $2 off coupon  that is on the back of the Fry's grocery store receipt across the street . It is enough for two meals and tastes great and includes a drink. What more can you ask for."}
{"text":"I just had a patron burrito at Filibertos Mexican food at 9036 West Union Hills. It was awesome. I ate here several years ago and was not a fan. They just opened up a while ago again after being closed for two years and there are new owners in this place. All of the bad reviews were from the previous owner . One of the owner's waited on me and she is a super nice lady. This Filibertos is really clean when you come in. I will be coming back real soon."}
{"text":"After reading the reviews on yelp and hearing about the famous Filibertos from other people I thought that this was going to be a memorable Mexican food expedition. I was pretty disappointed and so was my husband. His taco shell was over-cooked and you could tell it was dark. I on the other hand ordered a chicken tostada. The chicken was not even chopped I got chunks or chicken and they were big chunks too! To top it off they ran out of tostada bowls so they put a taco shell on the bottom of the plate crushed. *sigh* we ended up eating it because we didnt want our money to go to waste but we left unhappy and not fully \"food satisfied\""}
{"text":"Got a carne asada burrito and a large horchata (asked for lite ice) Waited about 10 minutes,  when I got the burrito it was cold and the horchata had two sips of fluid and the rest was ice.  When the cashier handed me the food she was laughing and goofing off.  Shitty location."}
{"text":"I've come to this location at least 10 times now since it's opened. I usually went to the one at Main and Power, but this one is now closer to my house. They have only gotten my order wrong once but I didn't notice until I got home so I had to drive back and have it remade. It's not a huge problem, I understand. I've worked in the food industry enough to know that accidents happen. The reason for the 3 stars is mainly because of the fact that I'm almost positive most of the people are stoned while they're working. Look, I don't care if you smoke. I get it, everyone needs their something. But some days they just can't get an order right to save their lives in the drive through and I have to repeat myself at least 3 times when I get to the window.

Edit: Still horrible service and apparently they close at 11:40pm not 12am, just a heads up. They can't get an order right to save their lives. I live literally around the corner but I go to another Filiberto's at power and main which is so much better and has great customer service. I recommend you do the same."}
{"text":"This is a great place for quick Mexican.  I don't even THINK about Taco Bell anymore.  I get the same thing all the time and am never disappointed.  I am THRILLED there is finally one in Scottsdale minutes away from work!"}
{"text":"I wasn't surprised to see this place was 24 hours, on first glance it just looked like a Mexican place crammed into an old burger spot. But I'm more than happy with my California burrito (which includes french fries and guacamole), but I had to request beans.

Big, like a good burrito should be and help-yourself chips and salsa. I'd definitely eat here again. (and I can imagine having to convince whoever I'm bringing here, yeah, it doesn't look like much--but it's good!)"}
{"text":"I go here one or twice for the st tacos, and they are the best that I've ever had hands down. The difference between this filibertos and others are these street tacos and the green salsa which tops them off...! I've told other's about this spot as well, and they continue to go back as well. I highly suggest it to any street taco lovers."}
{"text":"#1. Every location is different. This location in particular is the WORST! 
#2. Food is extremely overpriced with the amount I paid for two plates. That's a trip to the china buffet on a weekday. NEVER AGAIN! The employee was probably mad at me for not pronouncing the items on the menu correctly.. which, by the way, I've apologized for before and after I started to order. And furthermore, I told her which numbers on the menu I wanted so I didn't freaking offend her but nooooooo!!! Her response was, \"what? What? What? You need to Speak up! I can't hear you? Oh, you mean xyz?\" It's actually xy&z. Pull up to the window.\" 
#3 bugs galore on the drive thru window and you get bigger portions elsewhere. 
This is my worse review ever because I don't even want to focus on it. Take this place out!!!"}
{"text":"SPEND YOUR MONEY ELSEWHERE. THE WAIT, THE PRICE, IS NOT WORTH THE FOOD YOU RECEIVE IN RETURN. Drive a little further down the road to the one on Williams Field. They don't have these ridiculous issues with a simple order of TACOS. Or the rude service. The young lady answered the drive through with an irritated and impatient tone as if I interrupted her day... you work here, isn't it kind of your job to take drive through orders?!? Placed my order, waited for 10 minutes, I was given no receipt. I ordered rolled tacos & there was A SLIVER of meat wrapped in like 3-4 layers of tortilla. The red salsa was watered down & the chicken taco had THREE SMALL pieces of chicken, covered in a ton of cheese & lettuce."}
{"text":"There's a Filiberto's with a bar

I repeat, there is a Filiberto's with a bar. This is not a drill.

Half of this building is the everyday fast food place. The other half is a bar with a decent beer selection, and some mixes like margaritas. The two SHARE A KITCHEN, so you can enjoy favorites like quesadillas and carne asada fries with your booze. And like the standalone Mexican food operations, whatever you order will come flying out in like 5 minutes, which is amazing. All this while you watch one of the dozen or so adequately large TVs in clean, comfy seating. 

But more about the food. These cooks are trying out an American menu with burgers, BBQ, and more. I tried a burger with bacon, onion rings, and sharp cheddar. And while it didn't look like the greatest, it tasted like it came fresh from someone's grill. For about 10 bucks, this is better than what you'll find at your average sports bar. 

Watching games here is also nice. The sound is legit, and some of the screens are huge! Pints are very affordable. You won't hear me rave about Filiberto's, but this location does everything right. For that, I'm definitely a fan."}
{"text":"I can't believe I'm giving a Filiberto's five stars. Yes...this is real life. And this is seriously the best location. 

The lobby is open until 3am on weekends. Nothing extraordinary for this type of food, but they take VERY good care of the interior. Most of the lights are off, so it looks quite dim. Coupled with the soft music, it's like a scene out of some stoner romance film. 

The employees are nice, and they care a lot more than anyone at any late-night Mexican place I've seen. They don't just yell out your order, they bring it over to you and present it with pride, as if you were at a *real* restaurant. 

\"And for you, sir, the carne asada quesadilla\".

They actually take time (it was like a 10-minute wait) to season everything to perfection. Nothing about my meal looked rushed or sloppy, which happens at literally every other location.

Classy AF. If I'm around Indian School after last call, and I'm faded, you best believe I'm dropping by here."}
{"text":"Everyone in AZ has been to Filiberto's, and if you've expanded your horizons you'll realize it's nothing special. 

But who cares? This is Sun Devil turf. You're drunk, and there's a pretty cool crowd of fellow youngsters looking to scarf down some cheap food and pass out. Socialize while you wait a half hour for your order. When you feel like crap in the morning, just chalk it up to the four loko and forget about indulging in this embarrassment to Mexican food.

Two stars because those poor guys work so hard. Not that this review matters--they'll get plenty of business."}
{"text":"this is a newer, cleaner location.

their agua frescas are very good. get the cheese crisp! delicious simplicity!

free chips and salsa if you dine inside!"}
{"text":"WOW!  Just ate at Filibertos the first time (new to AZ) and was extremely impressed.  Went through the drive-through in Gilbert and ordered the enchiladas and they were amazing. Huge portions and great, low price.  Couldn't believe it was fast food.  Highly recommended."}
{"text":"MOST EXPENSIVE FILIBERTOS IN ARIZONA. 

With this location being in Scottsdale, the owner sure did take advantage of the rich city and overcharges by 40-55%. 

Visit a location on the west side of town, then visit this location. This Scottsdale location will easily overcharge. 

I understand $1 or $2 price difference, but $4 extra?

Scam location, will never return."}
{"text":"Decent inexpensive mexican food.  The fish tacos are excellent.
Unfortunately, the rice and beans are consistently not very good so I usually go to other restaurants if they are open."}
{"text":"The food is GREAT but unfortunately I've just had many mistakes due to the lack of English in the place but it's still very filling and authentic"}
{"text":"From LA and this place is better than most of the 'best' Mexican restaurants in LA!  I am very happy I found Filberto's and will def be back!  The red enchilada sauce is flavorful and not too spicy..the rolled tacos crispy and light!"}
{"text":"-2 stars. Really disappointed.  Nothing compared to other locations. Placed a big order for the whole family.  We were traveling thru. We waited 20 minutes for the food.  Half our order was missing!!! The food was under cooked. We were too far down the road to go back.  I spoke to the manager to explain what happened over the phone. They just hung up.  Called again, and was told to shut up and stop calling.  Avoid this location. Really bad service."}
{"text":"The service here is a bit variable, and it's very basic - but if you want good simple Mexican at an affordable price, this is a good place to go. My personal favorite is the machaca breakfast burrito, but so far everything tried has been great."}
{"text":"Just went here 2 weeks ago and it was awesome taco Tuesdays.  However sometime in the last 2 weeks they've changed their taco shells.  Seriously the Taco's shrunk by about 1/4th.... Sad..Guess I'll have to start enjoying Taco Tuesday somewhere else..."}
{"text":"Fast friendly service and food was good. Carne asada is lean (hate when it's gristley) tortillas are great but We don't like corn taco shells. Rolled tacos are the best and have been for many years. Carne Asada fries were good. Portions were big! Fish tacos were just ok. 
5 stars because nothing was horrible and people who give reviews need to remember how low stars can negatively impact a business. I just don't think anything was bad enough in any aspect to deduct."}
{"text":"Looking forward for a quick and good bite, highly recommend this filiberto. I have never liked filibertos but this place is good, clean, and excellent customer service."}
{"text":"It has been a few years since I have been to this restaurant. However, I remembered it being fantastic and affordable homemade mexican food. Great value. Casual dining atmosphere. Conveinent location."}
{"text":"Pretty awful food here.  Old, tough carne asada with little flavor and beans that don't taste like much.  And my wife, who is an addict and connoisseur of agua de tamarindo, actually poured half of her drink down the drain because it was so bad.  We also waited about 15 minutes in the drive-thru."}
{"text":"Tacos Tuesday, so two tacos and a drink were less than $5 and delicious. The free chips are great.  Service could be nicer, I accidentally took the wrong tray (I swear she said my number) and quickly brought it back when I heard my number again (I hadn't touched the food), but the lady behind the counter was not very nice about it even though I apologized about 5 times, she wouldnt even look at me lol. Oops!!"}
{"text":"H Filiberto's Mexican Restaurant Has great food for a fast food restaurant . However, their biggest detriment is their most recent change. They just increased the prices on their menu. Some by a significant amount that will leave this writer no choice but to bring my business elsewhere. Another issue I have with this particular location is when I ask for extra ingredients on an order. I find that they often either do not include them, they do not put much extra on and for what they charge for the extra item it is not worth it. (I.e. Extra cheese they charge over $1.00 extra)"}
{"text":"I love Filiberto's and this location is a great one, always prompt with orders and very nice staff. That goes for any hour of the day. It's also dog friendly in the sense that if you bring your dogs through the drive thru, then they have treats for your dogs :) the food is always quality regardless of what I order. I enjoy coming here mostly for breakfast and late night dinner almost never for lunch or any other time. But that is the nice thing about Filiberto's it's 24 hours so I can get my fix anytime. If you haven't tried it I recommend the California Burrito, it's basically carne asada fries wrapped up in my opinion and it's freaking delicious."}
{"text":"Overall an amazing Mexican place. Do not order the chicken quesadilla though, was pretty disappointed in it. The burritos are a winner though. Will always love this play."}
{"text":"It is 740pm door is locked and staff cleaning yet sign on for says open until 8.  No excuse for that."}
{"text":"Horrible customer service.   Walk up to counter.  Stand there 5 min before an employee is even seen, there is no acknowlegment whatsoever, waited another 5 minutes and left without talking to anyone, since no one came to the counter.    Acknowledgement would go a long way"}
{"text":"This location of Filibertos is much better and cleaner than the one in Sierra Vista.  The employees are nice fast.  The food is slightly above average and tastes pretty authentic.  It's a good place to go for takeout, and unlike the Sierra Vista location is nice enough for dine-in.  The food is not worth jumping up and down over, but it is good.  One exception, stay away from the menudo.  It was too greasy and tasted like it hadn't been cooked long enough."}
{"text":"Came during lunch and it wasn't busy at all, maybe 2 people inside and nobody in the drive thru. I ordered carne asada fries with the guac and sour cream on the side. I never got my change and couldn't get anyone's attention in the drive thru so I had to go back thru and ask for my change. The lady didn't apologize or anything. When I got home I discovered they put the guac and sour cream on my carne asada fries when I asked them not to. The carne asada is so over cooked it's inedible. The only positive is they gave me a good amount of hot sauce. Super disappointed since I live right around the corner and it would be really convenient for me. Guess I'll just drive the extra mile and go to fiesta burrito."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere and music, clean, welcoming place.  Great food and awesome service- Amber was just perfect.  Happy hour every day from 1100-1900 !!!!
Bar is set up very nicely."}
{"text":"I eat here often. The food is fresh and good, and I always special order anything I get. They get it right every time. And when I order super nachos I basically change it entirely :) to have only chips, chicken, beans and guacamole. They ring it up as chips + the items I want and it saves me $2. That's great right? Not sure why all the bad reviews, this is one of the best fast-Mexican food places in town"}
{"text":"This is definitely the LATE NIGHT hot spot. Since it is only one of the few places open 24 hours in phoenix, I hit this place up quite frequently. 

I have only known San Diego to be home of the infamous Carne Asada FRIES, and I was very excited to see that 'Bertos had them as well. I prefer the ones at the McDowell location to the ones at E. Thomas. They use the thinner fries. 

If you have yet to experience CARNE ASADA FRIES....you need to hop on board...QUICK!! Just imagine nachos, piled high with cheese, sour creme, guacamole and carne asada. Now...replace the tortilla chips with fries and there you have it. 

I know it may sound intense and overbearing to some, but I probably get them at least once every week or two. The rolled tacos are decent as well. Get them with cheese and guac. 

The only thing I wish for is better hot sauce/salsa. It's very blah and standard, but I still use it. Red one is the best in my opinion."}
{"text":"Carne asada fries are so good ! Most places the fries are starchy and mush.. but they had crunchy fries and plenty of toppings!"}
{"text":"I have been coming to this location since its inception and it's has continued to get worse and yesterday was the last straw. Went to buy my 4 chicken tacos like every Tuesday and receives what I would was were pathetic tacos. Little amount of chicken and no cheese. All lettuce! There is too many places I can go to get tacos and I am going to try all of them now. Adios"}
{"text":"I've never heard of this place until a week ago. I'm from California and was visiting some friends in Mesa, and they suggested that I try this place out. The next day I went there and ordered breakfast burritos for everyone. Let me start by saying that I wish there were places like this in California with the drive thru etc. The food was prepared fast considering what I ordered. The prices were cheaper than I'm used to paying for in Cali. Most importantly the breakfast burritos were huge and delicious! I especially like how they don't just stuff a huge amount of hash browns or potatoes in the burrito like they do over here. Open some more locations in California (Los Angeles area)!"}
{"text":"Make sure you retrieve your credit card. The woman never gave it back to me and when I came all the way back to get it, it was a hassle retrieving it. It left me uncomfortable as if it were going to be used as credit card frauds something."}
{"text":"Stopped in for a bite to eat. 
New to the area, thought this place was a newer spot, but after reading a few reviews -Seems like this is a struggling strip mall with lots of vacant shops, etc. However, my experience was a little better than others I guess?
Ordered a chicken tostada $3.99. Offer a few different options of meat. I got the Chicken. Tostada was a good size for the price, topped with refried  beans, meat, shredded lettuce & cheese. 
Salsa bar has 3 different types. Smoked chili mole' ( dark salsa) is the best one with a touch of heat. Also have a mild red (watery/bland) & a green salsa. Hot carrots: way to many small red chilies in it , guess they use those in the marinating process, but should leave those out when presenting/ serving at the station. Fresh sliced chilled cumbers as well.
Store was clean, service was good (considering it wasn't busy), but I don't think I would go through the drive thru based on my fellow Yelpers  advise!
Generally, ALL Filiberto's have coupon specials-if you didn't bring one with you; ask if you don't receive one \"after\" your initial purchase. You can take advantage of the coupon(s) on your next visit. *Blue small flier you can post on your frig offering weekly deals. Don't forget to go to ANY of these location for those offers & on TACO TUESDAY $1.19 for any meat styled taco!
SOME SITES propose .50 off when you check in with Yelp!"}
{"text":"This place is the \"BOMB\".
First time eating here when we moved to Arizona from California and by far beats many of the So.Cal. fast food Mexican joints!
Carne Asada meat is flavorful and delicious. The burritos are good size for the price. The chicken enchiladas are so good, sauce is a little greasy.
Rolled tacos super crunchy with sour cream, real avocado quac. & shredded cheese on top!
Restaurant is very clean.
Love the salsa bar and my absolute \"awesome sauce\" is the thick green one. They offer about 3-4 hot sauces, carrots, & pickled onions.
We love this place and will be back on a regular occasion to try out more of the menu!
Stayed tuned for more reviews-"}
{"text":"Carne Asada Burrito & California Burrito were good. Had them covered with red Enchilada Sauce.
Three Salsa's at the bar & hot pickled carrots are tasty!"}
{"text":"Just visited the Filibertos drive-thru for the first time and the girl was not friendly. She was not terribly rude either; however, she did not make us feel welcome at all. When she took our order in the drive-thru, she did not even bother to give us our total and once we pulled up to the window, we sat waiting for a couple of minutes before even being greeted. Haven't ate our food yet so this is solely based upon their customer service."}
{"text":"I wish I could give this place 0 stars. I repeated my order multiple times and still got mixed up. I asked for a chile relleno burrito and they gave me a pork and rice burrito. Soooo pissed. The meat was trash. This place has become the Mexican version of McDonald's, the quality of ingredients are terrible. Order a side of chips and watch them dissolve a day later in their container."}
{"text":"carna Asada fries! yep if you have not tried it take some time one day to enjoy the late night Mexican food nearest you.  
Carna, Asada, 
-take a large plate of fries, dump thin slices of beef, sour cream, cheese, guacamole, salsa and onions, bam!  


Another Filabertos Mexican restaurant,  seems to be kept clean.  As all the other location find this place 24 hours a day look for the bright yellow sign.


I go here for Weds Dollar bean burrito, add cheese for $80 or so.  
Drive thru yes,"}
{"text":"A lot of food for a cheap price; that's the only reason this place doesn't get one star. Place is just nasty dirty! Used my debit through the drive through, and the guy hands me the thing to type in my pin and its just covered with crap. By crap I mean it looked like it was dunked in grease, and then splashed with some kind of red sauce. I told him I wasn't about to touch that, you could tell he was mad. Thought he would clean it off, instead ran me as credit..."}
{"text":"Oh Filibertos you were such a disappointment tonight!

We had such a simple order - 2 bean burritos and an order of rolled tacos.  Order after order came up to the window and there we stood waiting and waiting and waiting some more.  It took 22 minutes for our order to come out.  That was after the employee repeatedly asking us what our order was and checking to see if it was coming up.  He finally realized that our order slip was not even on the round about and had to put the order in again.  When we complained that it took 22 minutes for our food, we got a blank stare and a \"um, sorry.\"  

Crappy customer service.  Decent food.  I don't think we'll be going back anytime soon."}
{"text":"We've been going to this Filibertos for several months.  Our old go to spot - Amado's keeps raising their prices so we said adios!  

I've never eaten in the restaurant before so I don't know how the dining in ranks.  We always take it to go.

We've always been happy with the food.  If you go to a place like this, you pretty much know what to expect.  I don't think people go for the atmosphere!  :)  

The best thing about this place is the Mon-Thurs .99 deals.   The salsa is pretty good too!  My favorite is the pico.  

Sometimes there's a long line, but we've always seen hard workers who are efficient workers.  They do get slammed though so it does tend to back up during the busy times."}
{"text":"Best service and food ever! We order all the time ! The chicken burrito with beans is my favorite as well as the carne Asada fries!!"}
{"text":"Went two weeks ago for rolled tacos and a burrito take out.  Got home in less than 5 minutes and found the rolled tacos to be cold and super skimpy on the cheese and guacamole.  Burrito was just OK without a lot of flavor for a carne asada.  Went back last night.  Ordered 2 chicken tacos, 2 beef tacos and 3 rolled tacos.  Asked for the chicken tacos without lettuce but they still put it on.  Again, for take out.  From their front door to my house is not more than 1 light and a few minutes.  Again, the chicken tacos were cold. The beef tacos had so much oil on them the filling slipped out of the taco.  Did enjoy the rolled tacos as they had put a nice amount of cheese and guacamole.  Only problem was the cheese never melted.  This was the closest taco shop to me but I will not be going back again."}
{"text":"Meh was ok
food is nothing special and the prices were average

guess I have to continue my search for good mexican food in arizona"}
{"text":"Awesome Mexican food, fast service at drive in or sit in and eat...try the new fish tacos, they're great, and authentic, too."}
{"text":"When they first opened it was great, the place can be hit or miss depending on the cook, but for the most part if you want 24/7 Mexican fast food this is the place."}
{"text":"Clean place and quick, enough to keep me coming back almost daily for Mexican food on the go. Daily specials.

However, my recent breakfast burrito was crunchy. Lots of egg shell chunks in my burrito, so much that I had to toss it. YUCK!

I got it to go and it seemed like too much trouble to contact them about it. I wasn't even sure if they would give me a new one. There shouldn't had been lots of egg shells in the first place. I probably won't go back. :("}
{"text":"This place isn't the greatest Mexican restaurant in the world, but it isn't the worst either. I  like Mexican food, but I don't care for the slow service and half warm food I got. I've been in a few times, which is why I give it three stars. The service could use some improvement. I don't think a smile would kill them. 

And since it's not all organic, I think the prices could be a bit cheaper. It's a hit or miss with this place.  Some days it's great. Other days, you wish you would have just let your 3 year old loose in the kitchen with last years leftovers.

Best I can say it try it for yourself. You'll either love it or hate it. Or like me, you'll deal with it when your in town."}
{"text":"The guy this morning was so rude to the customer before me That I will never return.... If I did not see it I would have not believe the counter person to be so rude to someone....,

Robert"}
{"text":"It was good. Needed something fast before heading to airport. You order at the counter and it's fast. Too much onion in the Huevos rancheros."}
{"text":"Honestly, never heard of Filiberto's until I moved here to Phoenix. Filiberto's is a Mexican chain restaurant that serves from rice plates, burritos, quesadillas and the like. It's also open 24 hours. I took advantage of their drive through, since I had a hankering for Carne Asada fries and needed something quick.

Carne Asada Fries & Horchata

TBH, the Carne Asada fries is indeed large in portion and comes with fast food, thin cut fries. Topped with a large amount of carne asada, guacamole, sour cream, shredded cheddar cheese and a side of sauce (red or green). The fries were okay, the meat was a tad bit tough and you get enough meat to cover the entirety of the fries. The sour creme seems a bit diluted, doesn't have a tang just adds a creaminess to the dish. The red sauce was nothing memorable, just a plain red sauce.

Typically, when I've had Carne Asada Fries they come with everything that usually comes in a burrito besides the tortilla. No signature kind of sauce? Guys, you're really making me miss La Victoria and Iguana's in San Jose, California.

Horchata, tastes diluted as well, probably came from the fountain and not made fresh- though it was not expected. Slight cinnamon flavor. Tastes more watery than rice- like.

Paid about $9 for Carne Asada Fries (that will probably last me as 4 meals) and a drink. Very bare bones kind of fast food Mexican, would only go here as a last resort or because of it's convenience. Other than that, wouldn't consciously choose Fili-B's for Mexican food- hankering and all."}
{"text":"I hope you do not expect to get any service when coming to this Filiberto's. The young kids there do not want to help anyone all the want to do is hang out and talk.  Do not expect to get any salsa unless you want to get out of your car and make it yourself.  Oh by the way, make sure you have an extra 45 minutes to wait for them to make your food and remember you are there.  I have gone to many Filiberto restaurants in the valley, but this by far is the worse.  Drive 2 miles to any other one if you are able to because I will not eat here ever again."}
{"text":"This is literally the worst Filibertos ever. There's this one broad working there who clearly thinks her time is more valuable than everyone else's & she's insanely rude. I'm legit never eating here again."}
{"text":"I was looking for a good \"taco salad.\" My old place had failed me on several occasions with a taco shell that was less than fresh. Filibertos was close-by and they had a drive thru, so I asked if they had a taco salad. Yep! I ordered one with extra sour cream & extra guacamole. Salsa on the side.

It was great!  . . . but it was not a salad. There were a few shreds of iceberg lettuce on top . . . a very few.  But, don't get me wrong, it was filled with pintos, chicken, rice, and cheese. It was tasty . . . and heavy.  The shell was fresh, but quickly became soggy from the beans & rice.  Salad wouldn't have done that so quickly. There was definitely extra sour cream; but a minimal amount of guacamole. I think I paid for extra of both?

All I can say at this point is that I will go back again and give them another try. This \"salad\" was excellent, although not really a salad. It was a combo plate in a shell. Enough food for a football player. It took me three meals to finish it all. Use the coupon on their website - $3.99.

The one real disappointment with the drive-thru was the service. The attendant was less than happy that day. Maybe it was just one of those days that we all have? Perhaps I will go inside next time."}
{"text":"Wheres the 0 star? It's horrible when people like here give you MEAT when you EXCLUSIVELY say you DON'T EAT MEAT! I had to take a bite to realize my burrito had meat in it even after I repeatedly asked them not to! Sadly i realized this at 1:30 AM when i drove back to my place and sat myself down to eat after a longggg day! Atleast I hope they will have the courtesy to gimme what I wanted next time I go there, bcs I feel robbed right now

UPDATE: I went back to return the burrito which they gave me with meat when i clearly specified NO MEAT, they wouldnt give me the burrito I asked for in return!! and they are so RUDE about it, and it doesnt help that they act like they dont understand English at all! One of the worst experiences, I feel CHEATED! Of course I know they cant read this review, its not like they would do anything different even if they did, I dont think they even care about Yelp!"}
{"text":"Went to this locations was over charged,  the receipt absolutely made no sense. We wanted to split the bill and do 4$ on my card and 4.79 in cash so we told the lady to wait while we got the change, she ended up charging the card 4.79 and taking the change. When I called in the morning to ask about it, the person could not speak english and hung up on me. Will never go here again. I know your not going to a five star restaurant but shouldn't there be some way of communication with them? We are in the middle of a college town and they can's speak hardly any english and really  hanging up on the customers?!"}
{"text":"Six years ago Filibertos were springing up everywhere. They were monopolizing the fast food mexican trade and putting all the polibertos, rolibertos, and Humberto's out of business, or at least that was the game plan. Today I am back in AZ and am saddened to see how much of a big player filibertos has become. With their streamlined business model, professionally designed identity and logo, and their official website, they have turned a personal relationship between taqueria and taco eaters into a perverted faceless business venture. Give me back my taco truck on the side of the road, not this futuristic look into the big taco machine. All conspiracy aside, the experience true taco lovers were accustomed to is all but dead, the flavors have become bland and the exchange is no different than driving Through a jack in the box or del taco. Socorro and Conchita are no longer hanging out the drive through window yelling at you in Spanish, the cook isn't also the owners cousin and landscaper on the weekends. But worst of all the Horchata is watered down. There are a few things I can look the other way for, but watered down Horchata is just not one of them. People, just because a restaurant looks new and clean and their drive through speakers work doesn't mean they are up to par. What are you willing to sacrifice for a uniform big box feel and convenience? You aren't getting lower prices, you are only getting lowered standards when it comes to taste. I don't need my drive through lady to speak perfect English and I don't need for the cook to wear a shirt when he's frying the meat, what I do need is true authentic flavor, nothing can ever come before that."}
{"text":"Tasty, inexpensive, late night cuisine.  Varied menu for south of the border grub.  Rolled tacos were good.  A couple of others in my party enjoyed the carne asada fries.  Quick, service.  Primarily takeout, limited outdoor seating."}
{"text":"Had the worst carne asada burrito there this morning. Tasted horrible and upset my stomach. I don't know if Fili B's is going downhill or this location just sucks but I'm not going back! I've been eating at Filiberto's for more than twenty years and this experience will turn me away for ever."}
{"text":"I love this place, but the management and customer service is nonexistent. I ordered some food via drive thru for my friends and I, all on one tab. I drove out to their house only to find that all of their orders were there, but my dinner was missing. Great. I checked my receipt and I was charged for my rolled tacos, but they were nowhere to be found. The next day when I got back home, I called and asked to speak to a manager. The guy asked me why, and so I told him I ordered food the night before and was charged for food I never received. His response? \"Well I don't think we can refund it. You should've come back last night.\" Excuse me, I drove out to Queen Creek only to figure out you guys can't complete a simple 3 item order. I won't drive back to Tempe unless you pay for my gas round trip, which won't happen. I calmly explained the situation and the guy just says \"Well the manager probably won't do anything but you can call back in two hours when he gets here.\"
So who exactly are you to tell me what the manager can and can't do, and that I should've come back the same night? No sir, you can provide a little customer service and take my name and number down and have the manager call me when he gets in and just apologize. I'm forced to provide excellent customer service at my job, and expect the same.
Never yelled at the guy, never bothered calling back over $5 in rolled tacos. Not worth the hassle of trying to deal with these people."}
{"text":"While my friend Rand H. enjoyed his meal here, I was not impressed.  There are no Filibertos in Northern California.  When I moved to Arizona and saw them all over I thought I might want to try them.  Almost everyone I know said \"noooooo, don't do it!\".  But I did not listen.  And I do like to think for myself.  Not everyone has the same taste so I gave it go. The taco shell was a bit stale, the meat tasted over cooked and greasy.  There was only one good thing about the burrito, the tortilla was fresh.  Overall I doubt I will go back but at least I can say I tried it."}
{"text":"We've been coming through the drive through on the way home in the morning for about a year now. We get the Country Burrito and a huge Quesadilla with rice and beans with a side of enchilada sauce. Today we had to use the restroom and finally saw the inside and not just the drive through window. The dining area, salsa bar AND restroom were all  really clean and neat. The food is great and every employee that has ever served us has been super friendly, helpful and professional. Thanks"}
{"text":"Every time I visit Arizona I love to eat here to food is vary good and I have my wife to thank for turning me on too this restaurant I wish they would have some in Georgia"}
{"text":"Grungy little drive thru, but I have to make this a stop every time I am in Phoenix. Their breakfast burritos with hot sauce - it's what I crave."}
{"text":"The Best Filibertos out there.  Check it out on wednesday for $1 bean burritos."}
{"text":"They are open 24 hrs, so I guess that where their 1 star comes from...

I got the carne asade fries, which was a little pricey but I was like hey, if its good its worth it. It wasn't good, nor was it worth the price. 

It was super greasy and oily and the meat was hard and chewy and dry. The weird part was, that regardless of all the things on the fries, it was kinda bland... Other than greasy and oily there wasn't much other flavors and it ended up giving me a stomach ache at the end... 

Overall, it was pretty expensive, around $10 for a plate of bland fries with overcooked meat. It extremely disappointing because this is Arizona and I would expect it to have really awesome Hispanic food, i really don't know why anyone in Az would come here especially when there are so many other amazing places around. I guess its because they are open so late?"}
{"text":"A friend told me I needed to check it out. Not a wow moment. I think if you're craving a quick Mexican fix this is the place for it."}
{"text":"Recently I moved back to the Valley of the Sun, one of my favorite meals here is Carne Asada Fries. I had high expectations since it has been almost 2 years since my last one, and they did not disappoint! Great service, amazing fries, and the best part they got my order exactly the way I wanted it! Was a great first meal back home, give it a try and add bacon if you're really wanting a meaty dish."}
{"text":"This location is just , ..........OK. To add to the 24hr drive thru comment everyone is leaving , they sinply forgot to say its only open 24hr on Fri,Sat and Sundays. So its really not open 24hr a day ... Just the three days which im not sure why but all the other bertos are open 24hr 7days a week 365 year. Not the best when it comes to getting orders right either i think its because the drive thru person taking orders and working the window sinply does not pay attention probably because they are too busy with the young children as workers. Im sorry when you are at work please stop texting on your phone and work ,Its called your on the clock for a reason and its called a job .... Anyhow they just opened this location and its progressively getting better i might add... And yes i live in the area of melrose and glad to have a location super close."}
{"text":"Takes way too long to receive your food and when I got my tacos the shells were soggy. Will not be returning to this filibertos."}
{"text":"So, I love their food here ! Carne Asada fries are my favorite BUT the customer service not so much. Me and my family came on a Saturday at around noon, so there was somewhat of a rush hour. That is still no excuse for poor customer service, I ordered my carne asada fries and specifically asked to get the guac on the side but they went ahead and put the guac on the fries and gave me extra on the side which they charged me for, they did the same with another carne asada fries but with sour cream. We let them know they messed up the order and after that the cashiers seemed to give us dirty looks. Oh and forgot to mention that they filled up my cup with ice but didn't let me know it was mine so I had to ask and reach over the counter into their side to grab it. Customer service has room for improvement! That makes a huge difference. Hope they make some changes."}
{"text":"Worse service I ever had. Ordered $60 worth of Burritos for a work meeting. Got treated like complete shit. Rude little skinny guy at the counter should be fired. He ran around and complained about the size of my order. I tried to call and give a heads up but know one answered the phone.  I will never ever come back to this place. I'll up date on quality of food after the meeting. 


Update on food. Food was acceptable but cheese in burritos was not melted."}
{"text":"Came here for a quick dinner pick up. Waited in the drive thru for about 12 minutes, and we were the only ones in line. Since it was taking so long we expected the food to be hot and freshly cooked... it sure didn't taste like it. Our order was Carne Asada fries, California Burrito, and a Carne Asada taco. The fries seem like they had been sitting for a very long time in the Carne Asada fries. The burrito tasted more like Carnitas rather than Carne asada, I'm also going to guess their guacamole is now prepackaged because it sure taste like one I've had from a store. The taco smelled like a bag of freshly opened dog food  we had come to this location before and never had this problem, but if it'll be tasting like this from now on, don't expect us to come back."}
{"text":"Filiberto's recently opened this location at a former Jack In the Box.

I ordered a carne asada quesadilla and pollo asado burrito.  Both were beyond crazy amounts of food - each was chock full of meat.  I preferred their chicken over the carne.  The chicken tasted flavorful and marinated, while the steak was just \"gray\" and didn't have a good grilled flavor (I know, what can you expect for meat cooked on the flattop).

The quesadilla came with a nice portion of sour cream and guac on the side.  Yeah, yellow cheese was the stuffing of choice, but it didn't taste too greasy.  

The burrito had guac inside with some onion/cilantro also.  They offered hot sauce and I happily obliged.

The staff was very friendly, and while I didn't go inside, I would expect it was your typical \"relatively clean\" -ertos style restaurant, although being Filiberto's is one of the larger chains, they seem to have better standards than their competitors."}
{"text":"I tend to forget about this location when I crave Mexican food. It's hidden a little. When I do remember this Filbertos it does not disappoint me. I have tried various items and truly love the tacos. Street tacos are great. I only give it 4stars because I don't care to much when the meat is not trimmed of fat. I don't like to chew down on fatty meat. This has been the case a few times with burritos and nachos the meat not being trimmed of the fat. But overall the taste and variety is worth giving it a try."}
{"text":"Filthy, sloppy, every time I asked for something on my order the girl replied with the opposite response, Me: \"can I have guaq on it?\" Her: \"So no guaq??\". The rice was WAY to sweet and tomato tasting, and the onions in my burrito made me sick. Never coming back."}
{"text":"The salsa's they give you taste like NOTHING! My food taste like straight up sour cream & fake guacamole. Thought I'd give them a second try and I'm pissed. What a waste of money. In Denver we have Chubby's & Tacos Rapidos. Which let me comment that it's BOMB. Spicy, FAT, and you definitely will have left overs. I'm sad and disappointed."}
{"text":"I was really anticipating a great green chile pork burrito. I went through drive thru. Very nice young man helped me. He asked if I wanted any hot sauce, I said yes I'm going totally green today. The total tab was $6.80 including tax for 1 burrito. Which I thought was pretty pricy considering it is fast food. The size of the burrito was very big and had a lot of big chunks of pork and green gravy. It tasted awesome. Just enough heat for me. But the pork was extremely tough. If the pork is braised or slow roasted it should melt in your mouth. There was a lot of fat in it too. The only way you can get that tough meat I believe is microwaving. I hope this is an isolated situation. What a waste of money. I have had rolled tacos with guacamole and they were good. I hope somebody else posts their experience with the green chili was awesome. Taco Tuesday! I ordered 2 tacos, one chicken one beef, the winner! Chicken! I was impressed with the taste and texture of this oh so familiar dried out, tasteless concoction. This was the bomb, tender, tasty, all the things you want out of a taco. Congrats! I'll see you on Tuesday"}
{"text":"Let me start by saying I've lived in AZ for about 8 months now and have been eating mexican food (burritos in particular) about 3 times a week since I've been out here.  I know Filiberto's is not exactly the classiest joint around, but it sure is delicious.  My first night out here I got drunk with a friend and ended up at a Fili b's late night. Which is another reason to love the place, they are open 24 hours.  Anyway it had to be one of the tastiest drunk meals I've ever had. I recommend the California burrito, not on the menu but it's carne asada, guacamole, cheese, french fries, and pico. Coming from NY we would normally get taco bell late night drunk eats, this is definitely a big step up in deliciousness and has a lot of great items on the menu all reasonably priced as well... give it a shot, I don't think you'll be disappointed."}
{"text":"A friend steered me here for the horchata, but you know what?  It just wasn't very good."}
{"text":"The drive-through was very fast and our Super Nachos were huge and very good. The carne asada is really good."}
{"text":"One of the better Filiberto's in terms of quality. Can't beat them for Mexican fast food. This location has a salsa bar, to boot.

Recommendation: BRC - the Beans / Rice / Cheese burrito - it's not on the menu but it's a solid option. Get it with a side of guac and sour cream.

Downsides to this location: no drive thru, and limited hours during the week.  24 hours Friday / Saturday."}
{"text":"Only God can cook a better Carne Asada burrito than Filiberto's."}
{"text":"I've been here twice.  Not happy at all.  This most recent time, I had to wait a very long time in drive thu for chips, salsa and side of refried beans.  Only to get a \"side of bean with rice\".  So disappointed.  The rice really isn't that bad, but the beans were awful.  The first time I ordered chips and salsa (which is too exensive) it came with the salsa on top in a Styofoam container.  WHAT?  I think it might have been to save a container.  Why soggy the chips with the salsa?  This yucky food does not live up to taco shop standards.  Go to Poloberto's on Glendale and 43rd Ave."}
{"text":"After all these years of late night clubbin and drinking, I always ended up here to get one of their burritos and honestly, it's still the same (besides the price increase). It was here I was introduced to a Carne Asada burrito and I've not been disappointed. 

The location is open 24/7 and is one of the best ways to get your Mexican style food fix when your hungry and looking for something good. Granted that have a bunch of drinks and other items but I find myself sticking to a buro. Decided to pick up the California Burro which is a carne asada with crinkle cut fries... Yeah... crinkle cut fries... 

I've never been in, only via the drive thru and the greeters at the windows have always been friendly and courtesy...even at 3 or 4am in the morning. 

If your looking for some something on the go or needing to get your \"grub\" on... you won't be disappointed with the food size and quality. Make sure you get both red and green sauce if you want to take it up a notch. 

I gave 4 stars only because for 2 burro's I spent just over $12 or $13 total..."}
{"text":"We eat here often, good rolled tacos with lotsa cheese, not too greasy.  We like the chimichangas but the beef ones always have lots of onions and peppers and not too much meat.  I just tried the chicken chimi and this time it was all meat, some beans and no onions or peppers, I'm confused?!?  Oh well, it was good but needed salt.  My husband had the chile rellenos and he said they had too much egg breading but were pretty good nonetheless, not stellar.  The guac has lots of large onion chunks but it's got a good flavor.  

Check your order, it's been wrong a couple of times."}
{"text":"THE WORSE FILIBERTO'S IN THE VALLEY!!!! BLAND AND TASTELESS ASSSSSSS HEEEEELLLLL! I never thought you could mess up Mexican Food especially Filiberto's.... but this location was HORRIBLE. Who ever is cooking needs a lesson in Mexican Food Prep and Sabor. I never give 1  but this one shouldn't even get 1. Beans are  & the Rice  really? How can you mess this up? 
This Filiberto's is going down as theeee worse. PASS on this one if you're in the area shopping."}
{"text":"Never busy when I go there at night. Very nice staff, good solid food, you got to love Filiberto's. I just wish they had a Drive-Thru! 2 Thumbs up for being very clean and friendly."}
{"text":"I am trying to do a low carb diet, I went in to order a burrito with no tortilla. I asked if they could slice an avocado . I was told they had no avocados, but the had guac. The staff was rude about my order and I didn't even get my guac. I went back for my side of guac and I got attitude, I said thank you after getting my guac and the lady just turned around and ignored me."}
{"text":"Food is good but their advertisement is false. I recently purchased their 5 mini tacos with a drink for 4.99. When he rings it up it was 5.98. Really dude - 97 cents in tax on a 5 dollar meal? Turns out they are ringing up each taco at the regular price of $1.09 which comes to 5.45 not 4.99. It's a trivial amount I know but its all about principal. It says 4.99 but apparently you like to charge 5.45. And to top it all off the guy says theirs nothing he can do about it. Uh yeah how bout ringing it up for the advertised price."}
{"text":"Everything was pretty damn good, carne asada fries on the money!! Will be back soon pretty decent on the inside and  very friendly staff"}
{"text":"I will never get a taco salad from Filibertos again. It was all mush, including the lettuce. The only fresh part about it was the shell."}
{"text":"So I've passed by this place dozens of times. And everyone kept telling me, it's only good if you've been drinking. Well against their better judgement I tried this place sober. 

I was pleasantly surprised. The service was great. There was a salsa bar with all the fixings. They had a Vicente Fernandez song playing in the back ground (always a good sign). They were quick. The had tons of options on the menu. I can't complain. Not sure I'd come here again on purpose (unless I was drunk) but all and all not bad.

I got a carne asada burrito to go. And it was just what I expected from a place like this... a carne asada burrito. I mean how can you mess that up. They did good. I only ate half, cuz it was big. So I used the meat the next day and scrambled it up with some eggs and the left over salsa. Yum!"}
{"text":"This is my \"grease pan\" chorizo breakfast burrito this establishment served after waiting 20 minutes in the drive through. This place should be closed down."}
{"text":"Love going there. The workers are nice and fast. The food is good, and at a good price. See you there if you are smart."}
{"text":"The food was extremely average.  Not bad,  but absolutely nothing to drive out of your way for.  Tried the chicken and shrimp - mediocre- chicken breast with bottled sauce poured on.  Fajitas with one large tortilla, what are you supposed to do with that?  Bloody mary was pure salt."}
{"text":"It was about a year ago that my wife and I ate there.  My wife got so sick after eating their food I almost had to take her to the hospital."}
{"text":"When I visit my sister in Phoenix, I'll often grab breakfast burritos here.  I've always liked all the \"-berto's\" restaurants (Aliburtos, FIlibertos, Dilberto's, etc) because the portions, flavors, and prices are decent."}
{"text":"I love this place for late night Mexican food! Everything I've always got was great! Yum!!"}
{"text":"This was my first visit. We ordered the taco salad with chicken...shell was deep fried nicely and the chicken  and sauce have a bit of a spice to it. One friend ordered the burrito plate, carne asada-- not much flavor to the beef. Lastly we ordered the chimichanga plate, shredded beef. This was also lacking in flavor. The toppings were plentiful and the rice was moist. The plates are enough for two people! I'm not inclined to return."}
{"text":"Their breakfast burritos are alright good.  Tried menudo to go which was good but it was just meat and no hominy.  Won't get that again."}
{"text":"Up to this point I would give this Filibertos 4 to 5 stars on thier taco Tuesday deal always full of beef but today I got 7 tacos they were all skimpy like half the meat as usual.
assume they got a new cook since I also  noticed the shells were a little under cooked(not like usual) so going to another place for my taco Tuesday's. I will check back in like 2 or 3 months if start to cook them like they used to. I'll update if the tacos get better."}
{"text":"As a San Diegan Native, Filibertos is the closest thing I can get to authentic Mexican food. Did I mention that the food was so darn cheap?

You can get tacos for as cheap as $1 on weeknights. I did pay $2 for my soft taco and paid $2 for a large horchata. This did not disappoint. I've also tried their burritos and it's not bad! 

If you're looking for a cheap, easy, late night, dinner or lunch meal with your friends, this is the place to go. 

This especially goes well when you want to eat and snack on something when you're karaoking at your friend's house!"}
{"text":"Have you ever had to wait 30 minutes in the drive through? Neither had I until I went to this hell hole. The obese woman who takes your money had a look of emptiness in her eyes as if she knows her life has peaked. I'm sure the cook was sleeping or getting high in the bathroom while I was waiting for my order of one burrito with two cars in front of me. I can't believe it took literally 30 minutes from when I drove up to when I was given my receipt and not even thanked for paying them to give me diarrhea. Screw that."}
{"text":"You get the same burrito at every filibertos. The drive through man would only give me 2 sauces when I asked for 4. I was sitting at the open window and he just pretended like he couldn't speak English. Lies."}
{"text":"For what it is, fast food Mexican, this is a pretty good place. I especially like to come here in the morning for a breakfast burrito. My favorite is the sausage burrito, though I've also had potato egg and cheese, and bacon(bacon burrito was a bit  too salty). I have had chimichangas and tacos and Menudo (only available on weekends). It's all pretty good. It's not as good as a sit-down restaurant but it is a drive-thru... so, what do you expect?"}
{"text":"I go to this place pretty regularly because it's easy and reasonably priced, also on my way home from work. The service is quick but not friendly at all, but who cares right? The food is good. To be honest the only reason it's getting such a low rating is because the hot sauces are garbage. Like literally non spicy colored water. I bring it home so I use my own, and that's what makes it good, but I would never get stuff from here if I was just out and about.  I hope they pick up their hot sauce game, because if they do I'm gonna move that shit up to a 4 star."}
{"text":"I have had great luck here with their customer service and food so far.  Usually it's breakfast burritos and tacos on \"taco tuesday\"."}
{"text":"Quality of food has continued to decline.  The last item I ordered was chicken tacos (4 of them) and 2 were full of nothing but chicken skin and cheese.  No real meat.  The other 2 were a combination of meat and skin.  Not what I had planned for dinner.  Not to mention how rude the cashier was."}
{"text":"NEVER AGAIN! Normally a fan but I just went thru the drive thru and was thoroughly disappointed. I get to the menu and wait for a response for a few minutes. The sign says open so I asked if anyone was there. With no answer I eventually left. I called the store and was told they were down for maintenance. I asked why there was no sign that stated this and was ignored. I understand the need for maintenance but put a sign or tell me thru the mike instead of letting me sit there and wait.. definitely not coming back."}
{"text":"We have been eating here at this location for years, love it, but lately they have had issues. One, the staff is less than friendly these days. Always seem to be in a bad mood, never say hello or thank you, seem like they don't want to be there and don't want to be working, just unpleasant service. Two, more often than not the food has been of poor quality and upset everyone's stomach. I'm not talking about just the normal Mexican food upset stomach, I'm talking sick as a dog upset stomach. I'm not sure what the problem is here but somebody needs to pay more attention to this location, staff and food quality. We have been eating at Vaqueros lately and their food is great and staff is nice."}
{"text":"If I could give ZERO stars I would. Never get the order right, this is literally the second time we left with NO food and a waste of time. Don't do here, ever."}
{"text":"How this place is so loved and popular amongst so many in the Phoenix area astounds me. I love the idea of their food and hours they are open is awesome, but every time I have eaten at this low cost palace for late night cravings, I got real sick.

The food quality is low and the taste is nothing amazing. Either way certain conveniences about this establishment make it the ideal spot for high school and college kids so they will continue to thrive with little effort to providing quality."}
{"text":"This place was horrible I ordered the asada fries and they smelled like a rotten fart! I'm from Southern California where we eat real Mexican food! Poor excuse for Mexican food my first and last time! So glad we don't have them in LA!"}
{"text":"God this Filibertos is one of the worst I've ever had. My tacos tasted nothing like beef and the shell itself was sweet for some reason....my boyfriends Carne asada burrito tasted like beef soup in a tortilla not anything close to mexican foods. If you fed this to me while I was blindfolded I could not have guessed what it was. Beans and rice were very bland."}
{"text":"Gross.

Desperate, I ate here and regretted it about 10 minutes after finishing and for the next 24 hours."}
{"text":"I've been here a few times and each experience has been different. The first time the food was good and service has rude. The second time the Tuesday tacos were good and third time they were aweful. I won't be back, this place is too inconsistent. D+"}
{"text":"Delicious, fresh, fast, and affordable!!! Breakfast burritos are great anytime of day. I always choose Filibertos over the competition simply for the taste of the food."}
{"text":"We live right down the street, and always go to this location. I mean it's convenient......
BUT
This location is horrible. 
The drive thru is sloooowwwwww.!!!
They never get our order correct. Ever. 
The ladies are decently nice, but still have attitude. 
The meat is always dry and overcooked. 

We will be driving a little farther to a different location. Hopefully that one isn't as bad. 
This one needs to shape up a little more. But I guess it IS fast food."}
{"text":"The food here is usually good but tonight they could not seem to get the order right.  After getting home with our order placed in the drive thru we find out that our side of rice is missing.  My son goes up there to let them know they forgot the rice and they just gave it to him and didn't even offer to remake his burritos.  He gets home with his rice and begins to eat his cold burritos to find out they gave him the wrong burrito.  There were other items in this order that were correct so it was not like they gave us the wrong order.  The receipt even had the rice on it.  Very incompetent employees working tonight."}
{"text":"This is the last time I visit filobertos!! The burritos are small!!! And $7.00!!   I'm very unhappy. They used to be bigger and only 5.75. I will no longer visit any place except Los favoritos.
Edit to say the meat doesn't taste good like Los fav"}
{"text":"This is a great location for Filiberto's food.  If you want fresh, large portions, and have a craving for Mexican food this is your destination.  We have ordered several times for lunch for work.  We call in advance and place a to-go order which in our case could be 20 breakfast burritos.  The best part is that when everyone at work gets one of the breakfast burritos or Carne Asada burritos everyone is happy.  Nothing like a happy workplace and a satisfying meal.  

The breakfast burrito has lots of egg, green onions mixed in, ham, pico, bacon, and cheese.  Be ready that bacon is real bacon with fat also, so if you hate fat skip the bacon.  If you love bacon that fat adds a nice flavor to the burrito.  They also give you green and red sauce, but both are mild to no heat.  

I also enjoy the Carne Asada burrito and be prepared it is a large burrito.  Most cannot finish it in one sitting.  I pride myself on doing so and then fall into a work coma after wards :)


They serve breakfast all day I highly suggest a breakfast burrito to fill a really empty belly.  And at $4 it really is a lot of food for the cash.  Enjoy."}
{"text":"People will say what they are gonna say bout this place but the breakfast burritos are 2nd to nobody's..   They take to time to boil the potatoes and make the tender as opposed to throwing a frozen French fry in the fryer..  Crispy bacon and lots of cheese..  4 outta 5 cuz the service is a little slower then it really should've ..  I will return soon for another.."}
{"text":"Came in today for my second time and was very pleased. Staff was very friendly and service was fast. I had a rather large order and it was done correctly and very fast. All good tasted wonderful and not a single complaint. We actually quit going to filibetos a long time ago due to another location (51st and baseline) they couldn't get the other right and would argue. I'm thankful for this location because they are doing it right. Thank you we'll be back."}
{"text":"Wow - where do I begin?? This place was AMAZING!!! This is seriously the BEST Mexican place I've ever eaten at!!! I ordered the #8 Carne Asada soft tacos and it comes with rice and refried beans. Their carne Asada was soo juicy and thick and they put so much in there!! It was fresh!!! It was PERFECT!!! 

My boyfriend got the breakfast burrito and it was huge!! My boyfriend said it was the BEST he ever had!!! He was just sooo over the moon with this burrito!! He said he will def be coming back.


They had delicious chips and freshly made salsa. We will def be coming back often plus my family is coming down to visit and we will bring them down here for dinner one night. I can't wait!! I recommend everyone to go try this place!! Me and the boyfriend wish we can give this place 10 stars!!! 

The owners were very sweet and very accommodating.   We definitely will be back VERY soon!!!"}
{"text":"The Carne Asada Burrito is what put this place on the map in the first place and that was the reason for my visit - this monster will cure any hangover. Their hot sauce is perfection so load up with several cups if you order this bargain behemoth to go."}
{"text":"The restaurant looks like an irradiated Soviet diner rapidly abandoned during the Chernobyl disaster. The parking lot is a lake of pigeon droppings and broken beer bottles. Most of the booths are in various stages of disrepair. At least two were being used for storage. One for obviously unused mops and brooms, another for those gray plastic child booster seats I once saw at a Big Boy's in the 1980s. The staff are surly, which normally never bothers me because I go to restaurants to eat, not to make friends. But here, the staff are so indifferent as to be hostile. And they guard napkins as if they were gold. Perhaps they're worried customers might start wiping down tables--God only knows what might get uncovered. I ordered a carne asada burrito, which turned out to be a tepid mound of what looked like wet dog food wadded up in a stale tortilla accompanied by a grayish paste and one or two small pieces of unripe tomato. My companion had the fish tacos, basically two tortillas topped with balls of batter cooked in rancid oil and topped with what might have been iceberg lettuce and some kind of thin white liquid. The chips were free, but to get them, I had to flag down then supplicate one of the aggressively inattentive workers. The salsa options were watery red or watery green--both insipid. They also provide free lemons. Which is good if you like lemons."}
{"text":"It's your standard Arizona 'Berto's type place. Big burritos. (Attn: San Diegans - This is NOT Roberto's. It has similar offerings, but you are gonna be disappointed in the salsa department. Fair warning.)

They make a pretty decent carne asada plate, but I usually go with the carnitas plate. That's pretty good.

The guacamole isn't worth the price. Skip it. The green salsa is pretty tasty, but lacks any punch whatsoever. The red is watery and also lacks punch.

If you are really hungry and LOVE fries - you can't go wrong with the Carne Asada Fries: Tons on the plate. Tasty, but expensive. Definitely enough to share with 1 or 2 friends.

No Mexican cokes.

Taco Tuesday is a good deal at 99cents though. Chicken or shredded beef."}
{"text":"Food has taken a Dive in Quality. Carne Asada is no longer tender In their Burritos and Prices have sky rocketed..Stay Away"}
{"text":"The prices here seem to be higher than they are at other locations. The portion sizes also seem smaller. Not sure if it's the management here or maybe I just haven't been to a filiberto's in a long time. 

The food itself is rather bland and over cooked. You can expect a lot of oil regardless of what you order. Some of the salsas that are offered are great tasting and can add the needed flavor to your meal. 

Don't come here if you're expecting anything resembling healthy or tasteful food. If it's a late night last resort after the bars, it's better than nothing. If you have any other choice, skip filiberto's!"}
{"text":"Drive-through equipment needs to be replaced as it's hard to understand the order taker with all of the static. Staff could also up their customer service skills. If you don't like undercooked potatoes, make sure to ask for none in your burrito. Also, they didn't ask if I wanted salsa, they just put red salsa in my bag and I wanted green, too. I asked for some."}
{"text":"This place always gets my order correct and they are fairly quick. Only reason I don't score higher than a 3 is because the customer service needs improvement."}
{"text":"This is a pretty clean and big Filiberto's.  The food here is pretty good and I did not have any problems here with the people working here.  Also, in a pretty well-lit area so I don't mind eating here late at night."}
{"text":"Decided to try the carne asada nachos (no guac or pico). There was plenty of meat and sour cream, but the cheese and beans were lacking. And I found a long, dark hair in the middle... Don't think I need to come back. Plenty of other good Mexican options around."}
{"text":"First time visit... Tasted ok, equivalent to a Frederico's, place looked very clean, staff very nice. Sad to say my stomach doesn't agree so I give it 1 star. I also left without realizing the salsa is self-serve even for take-out. If you try this place, don't forget the salsa."}
{"text":"Alright, I try to never review chains and all, but Filiberto's is my go to. My favorite food is Mexican, and what's more convenient than Filiberto's? They are quick, open 24/7, have a drive-thru and are definitely on the cheaper side. No, I don't think their set up is going to be named a 5 star restaurant, but I believe their food is pretty authentic. You won't find tamales and all but you can find some pretty darn good Mexican street food here. My favorites are either the Carne Asada Fries, Carne Asada burrito or their rolled tacos. They have healthier dishes too like their bowls and salads, but AS IF! I try to stay away because Mexican food isn't too good for the body, but they keep on having me come back I can't resist! Filiberto's is too darn good!"}
{"text":"Horrible food and horrible service. They don't know what is in the recipe ie taco salad. Smh"}
{"text":"Let me preface this by I LOVE FILIBERTOS- the location on Indian School & 30th St and 7th St & Thunderbird and I have fond memories of one in Tempe on University. This one on 32nd St & Greenway is bad. Just bad. I've only used their drive through so the wait time was fine, but they consistently get my order wrong (no pico de gallo) and have even not been given my credit card back leading to the typical credit card replacement drama."}
{"text":"This is the worst Filibertos I've been to in AZ.  Last time I went the burritos were almost entirely raw cabbage filled.  Just go to one of the other 'bertos.  This place always gets something wrong or tries to screw you over."}
{"text":"This establishment needs employees with stronger English skills. I ordered a BEEF burrito and ended up with a FISH burrito. It wasn't until I got home (which is 15 minutes away) that I noticed the order was screwed up. Looks like Los Favs is getting my business from now on."}
{"text":"Stopped in for a couple breakfast burros. The burros were huge and good as usual. However the guy at the counter was really rude hence we won't be back. He was friendly to certain customers just not me."}
{"text":"F I N A L L Y, an option for a breakfast burrito that isn't closed on Sunday in Anthem!

Went in today and the younger guy behind the counter (didn't catch his name) was so nice! He was more enthusiastic and helpful than most people behind a register. Awesome customer service."}
{"text":"Arizona Burrito with Sour Cream.  Period.  Hands down the Best.  Filling & has everything you want in it  !  ( value added fun gas too ! )"}
{"text":"Stick with one of their staples for consistency. Be smart, it's Filibertos for goodness sake !  The Arizona Burrito with sour cream. Yum. Always filling & tasty :)"}
{"text":"Horrible! I ordered the carne asada burrito, it was just meat and pico de gallo and guacamole in 1 small section of the burrito. The Meat was the most salty thing i have ever ate in my life i could only have a few bites and had to give up. Def not my next choice."}
{"text":"Worst filibertos ever.  I ordered carne asada fries, when I got home the fries looked old not freshly fried. The meat looked old as well like it was sitting there or awhile.  Tha place is consistently horrible.  That's why they have no refunds noted on the door. 

The filibertos in tolleson is by far the best tasting and freshest."}
{"text":"Stopped here after our flight from Seattle, I was suuuuper hungry so appreciated the fast service. I had the carne asada burrito, it was HUGE and they didn't skimp on the meat at all. Bf had steak and chicken tacos which he liked. The horchata was very good, not too sweet or chalky like some other places where I've had it. Pickled carrots from the condiment bar were pretty bland to me but the jalapeños were yummy, I'm a baby when it comes to spicy food but they were very flavorful with just enough heat. I can't say I'd go out of my way to come here but I would eat here again if it was convenient."}
{"text":"Meh.  I stopped here for a quick bite to eat and after noticing the Kebab place next door, I wished I would have gone there instead.

I ordered the Five Roll Tacos with Carne Asada.  Huge portions, it's was roughly $8.  I could only eat half.  The salsa doesn't seem quite spicy at all and the whole dish needed more salt, particularly the meat."}
{"text":"Ive been to alot of filibertos throughout the years and this has got to be one of the worst ones ! Stopped by for a breakfast burrito around 9 am . I am the only one in there and it took 20+ minutes for the sloth on the grill to make it. homie was watching tv and talking to the cashier so much that he didnt pay attention to the food on the flat top... open my burrito and it dark as his soul.. he had burnt the chorizo so bad it was bitter! Horrible experience there i really hope they get shut down ! The food is awful here!"}
{"text":"Ok Filibertos is Filibertos but today they really mad me mad and ripped me off.  I ordered a a Ham Breakfast Burrito with Potato's I know (Guilty pleasure) and xtra cheese and it came to $7.00 and I said how does a BB start at $4.59.  I got my receipt and they charged me $1.19 for cheese OMG.  The guys came back and I asked dont you think that is exseccive for cheese and said that is just what we charge for 3OZ of cheese that $19.04 per LB.  OMG go to Costco and stop ripping people off never going to this Filies again!!!!!

Once again ripped off 1.19 for cheese I just forgot do they even read these"}
{"text":"Hadn't eaten at a Filiberto's in several years and popped in to this neighborhood one for a dinner inside. Looks like they don't have the \"Big Juan\" burrito any more. . .counter clerk gave me a blank look when I asked about it. Counter clerk and the cook were under siege--busy! Clerk couldn't tell me which of the salsas was the hottest, so I had to do a sampler of several, hoping not to run afoul of the \"please don't waste the fixings\"-type sign above the salsas. My adobada burrito was tasty, maybe a little under-seasoned, but SALTY. Even the salsas were salty.

The interior was much cleaner than I anticipated for this rather dodgy neighborhood, and no one was boisterous in the dining room, which will put me off any dining establishment. (This is common in the area--public table manners are frequently a bit lacking.) I want a pleasant environment while I eat and was happy to be able to eat in peace without any panhandlers, etc. hassling me.

Nothing exceptional here, but nothing terrible, either."}
{"text":"Stopped by two weekends ago for 3 rolled tacos with guac. They charged me for 5 instead of 3. Make sure to ask for and read your receipt. I love their food otherwise I wouldn't waste my time with the lacking customer service at this location."}
{"text":"I have loved the Filibertos Food chain for YEARS! But this location is cool, I can drive my semi up (with no trailer of course....) and use the drive through too! To me, the food is ALWAYS great at any Filibertos, they simply rock this \"White Boy's World\"! :)"}
{"text":"I have gone to this place for a long time, always good.  Today everything was dry.  Green Chilli burrito had meat, no sauce in it at all.  My wife's steak quesadilla was bad, per her review.  I had tried Tacos on a Taco day in the past.  We got just meat with no lettuce or cheese.  I am not sure I will try one more time.  The food used to be great, lately it has been very bad."}
{"text":"I'm not much of a sugar coater like the rest of these reviews and can say that this place wasn't really good. I ordered the California burrito and the carne tasted really dry. The papa's were over cooked and taste like a mash potato. I also asked the guys for Jalapenos, carrots and they ran out. Ok, how do you run out of Jalapenos? That's like going to McDonalds ordering French fries, requesting ketchup and being told their out. I don't get it? Well deserved one Star."}
{"text":"Gotta love taco Tuesday lol. I haven't really got anything but the shredded beef tacos and carne asada burritos, but I've never been disappointed."}
{"text":"Taco Tuesday is the bomb! Also ordered the Super Nachos which were delicious!
Inexpensive and tasty!"}
{"text":"This DJ sucks I asked 2 hours ago for salsa or merengue music they don't paid attention to the customer request only to the request of one table ...that requested Cumbia all the time"}
{"text":"Just visited this location today at about 10pm. We went through the drive thru and attempted to order a #7 and 2 beef tacos. After saying our order it was not repeated back to make sure it was correct nor did the employee tell us what he had for our oder at the window when we paid. The order was wrong only gave us our #7 and then we asked for red sauce and received only green. After this visit we were so displeased we visited another fast food restaurant to meet our needs."}
{"text":"This location and filibertos in general is just awful. Got two tacos and two bean burritos. Came home with two green Chile burritos. Staff is not always the friendliest and don't know what extra and only red sauce means. Done with filibertos and never returning."}
{"text":"food is always good, drive-through SUCKS, and as with the whole chain, they charge a service fee for using your card."}
{"text":"I'm visiting from San Francisco and wow is there a lot of Mexican food around here!

OMG delicious drunken burrito goodness!  I got the Arizona, recommended by a latina friend.. it has potatoes, I believe carnitas, salsa and sour cream.  Plus awesome hot sauce, which I drizzled all over it.  Really the best late night after-drinking food!"}
{"text":"A 'fast food' Mexican restaurant with decent portions and Good Food. There seems to be a lot of variation with each location, but this one is one of the the above average locations.

My wife and I stopped for dinner, and they met our expectations. We both got Burritos, one chicken and one pork. Both were good, although I enjoyed my wife's chicken one better, but maybe that was because it was hers! 
Will definitely go back when in the mood for fast food Mexican!!"}
{"text":"Is this place not open 24 hrs anymore? Because it says 24hrs and if not post hours of operation on the window or something I've come here 2 times and they've been closed and not the same times on 2 separate occasions on was on Sunday night and one was Friday night"}
{"text":"NEVER ORDER FROM HERE! I ordered a number 19 plus a Carne Asada Fries... Lady taking the ordered did not have the decency to ask for choice of meat.... then when we asked for chicken, she proceeded to ask if we wanted shredded or grilled chicken, but received the order and was told the cook didn't want to change the order from beef to chicken because he already made it... got a refund and don't plan on ever coming back to this sh*thole... no wonder they have a overall two star rating... last i checked the cook is hired to cook and thats it, not make executive decisions on peoples orders... do your Job and make the customer happy, don't be lazy and say u don't want to remake something because you already made it, thats not your decision to make \"Chef Boyardeeznuts\""}
{"text":"I have been going to Filiberto's for twenty years, and love the food, but this location seems a bit sub-par. I opened the door and was enveloped by a fog of dope smoke. I sat down and started in on my burrito, which I discovered was not bad, but not Filiberto's good. Strangely, the longer I was there the better the burrito tasted."}
{"text":"I have never been to this location. I used to love Fili's, but lately many seem to have gone downhill. This one though is like the Filibertos of old. A burrito as big as your head, and a drink for a five buckos special."}
{"text":"Both my daughter and I got to spend a fun filled Sunday sick to our stomachs, retching, plus all the highlights that go along with it.  Interestingly enough, Saturday night, we both had bean and cheese burritos with guacamole here.  I'm not saying we got food poisoning from Filiberto's, but it is definitely suspect."}
{"text":"I've probably been to 30 locations, but I'm going to rate this one because this is where I first got to know Filiberto's.  I'm a huge fan of the Super Nachos, the Bacon Burrito, and the Carne Asada fries (which are really nothing but super nachos where the tortilla chips are replaced by french fries).  

This place is very affordable for the amount of calories you get.  Fili's may not have some of the bells and whistles that you expect from other national fast food chains like Taco Bell or McDonald's, but in my eyes, it doesn't get better than some carne asada fries washed down by a tasty horchata from Filiberto's."}
{"text":"It's convenient they're open 24 hours, but the cheese on my rolled tacos wasn't even close to being melted. Also, they forgot to give me a fork for my carne Asada fries. They could also lower their prices, at least a dollar for each item."}
{"text":"If you're new in town or just visiting, you'll probably hear of \"Filly B's\" and, unless you're oblivious or don't actually get out on the town, you're bound to see at least one... no, two... er, three... well, let's just say with Valley-wide locations and knock-off variations of this restaurant you're prone to encounter it. Pretty much every Valley resident is familiar enough with this local chain that speaking its name conjures familiarity, it can be part of a joke locals understand and is a guilty pleasure for people with even the most refined tastes. It's more expensive than Taco Bell, but the quality and portions are bigger. Watch out after last call as the drive-through lines tend to back up. Most locations are open 24 hours and it's a great place to stop for cheap eats: more than likely there's one on the way home."}
{"text":"Went there this morning to pick up food for a big crew doing work for me.  Sever at the counter was super nice and suggested a menu of items. They had it ready 4 minutes later and out the door.  Really impressed.  Food was fantastic."}
{"text":"I'm partial to rolled tacos and vegetarian nachos, and theirs do not disappoint. Other fast food Mexican restaurants in the area serve that liquid goo on their nachos and pass it off as cheese. Not Filiberto's. And their shredded beef in the rolled tacos is nicely seasoned."}
{"text":"I love Filibertos, especially after a long night of drinking with your buddies. But this one time was probably the worst experience ever. Salty cold meat. Enough said. Just sick."}
{"text":"Be it cats or dogs, this location has been my local carne asada watering hole for over a decade now. Sure, it's dirty. Sure, there's only outdoor seating and sure, there are occasional bullet holes in the ceilings, but nevertheless the food is always the same; greasy drunken night goodness! I love you filly b's! You always know to keep me regular."}
{"text":"Why do I have to be there in order for you guys to start making my food?! Absolutely ridiculous!! Who does that?! 
Who wants to wait while you cook?! Why can't you take my payment over the phone make my food and have it ready in a decent time?  

Dont reach up to me to offer me free stuff I don't need it! 
Fix your system!"}
{"text":"Filiberto's is a local favorite for late-night Mexican food. The quality of food has always been decent and worth the wait-time. This location takes exceptionally long, but it's a good sign that your food is fresh. 

Items to get: Bacon Breakfast Burritos, Carne Asada Fries and anything with Guacamole. Their salsa is also decent and has some kick to it."}
{"text":"I've been a frequent customer of Filly B's for a while. This location is close to my work and home and I've easily consumed over 30 breakfast burritos from them. Great quality food, reasonably fast. 

Should be noted they charge $0.60 additional for credit card fees. Their drive-thru customer interaction isn't excellent, but they are to the point. 

~Joe"}
{"text":"Carne Asada and salsa bar are great.  We didn't experience a long wait or any rudeness from the staff.  Great place for some fast food that will fill you up."}
{"text":"Just went through the drive thru tonight around 10pm. Ordered 2 cheese quesadillas and an order of chips. The total? $17.04. I got chips and two cheese quesadillas. How the hell is that 17 dollars. So when I got home I checked the receipt. My order of chips was rung up as guacamole nachos subtract guacamole. Figured chips shouldn't cost 6 dollars. And no way should a cheese quesadilla cost five dollars. Federico's on cave creek and Beardsley charges 3.50 for a quesadilla. This Filiberto's is a scam. Not to mention the taste is rather terrible of their food. Do not listen to good reviews. This place sucks. Go to Federico's instead"}
{"text":"Horrible service!! The guy sounded like he was high and could give two shits about us. Asked for stuff on the side and was never given it. Won't be back, that's for sure....."}
{"text":"Arizona and need a quick tastie good meal . . . nothing fancy but just plan good.  Yea, these are the places to seek and find.  Nothing exceptional other than just good food for the buck.

ALWAYS find a Filaberto's and enjoy."}
{"text":"DO NOT COME HERE YOU WILL BE SORRY!!!!!
Went in for a California burrito they put guacamole in the burrito. So I took back inside to have redone. Lady says it comes with guacamole and I said in my entire life nobody puts guac in a cali burrito. She would not fix or give me my refund. I WAS IN SHOCK!!! Dude behind counter says in Spanish \"go ahead give him his money back\" I was thinking to myself.. these Mexicans are nuts do they not think there a business in the USA... 

I honestly think he gave me my money. He didn't want any heat there like cops.. because that's were it was gonna go if I didn't get my burrito fixed or my money back.."}
{"text":"I was referred to this place by a friend upon moving to Arizona, i'm not a huge fan of Mexican food but finally decided to try it for breakfast one morning since I was craving a breakfast burrito. It was HUGGGGE, definitely worth the 9 bucks, and very tasty. Do not be scared off by the appearance of the location, the food was well worth it!"}
{"text":"I always recommend sticking to the drive thru with any fili location because there is nothing special when it comes to the dining rooms. 

Food is good for being fast food Mexican. It's above Taco Bell but don't think you are getting anything much classier than that.  

Huge portions, great burritos and rolled tacos. I'd recommend if you want to indulge in some good fast food."}
{"text":"Overall I'm a fan of filibertos. They've got great burritos for breakfast and lunch. This location specifically has lunch specials during the week. They differ each day, but I usually swing through on Monday's because you can get 3 rolled tacos, rice, beans and a drink for 5 bucks. A good deal if you ask me. 

I will say, yes, the drive thru is slower than most, especially during the lunch rush which can be frustrating if you need to make it back to work. However I consider this place a step above Taco Bell/McDonalds so I don't really hold it against them. It's just something to be aware of."}
{"text":"One of the employees at the location in Laveen was so rude. We drove through the drive thru around 11pm and were really polite. When we got to the window, the young lady acted like we did something wrong. The food wasn't great either. I'll give them another shot and hopefully my opinions will change."}
{"text":"Happy Customer! Came in at 8am, ordered 2 tacos combo...food came out Really fast, the taco shells are super crunch and surprisingly delicious, the chicken is flavorful, and the place was really clean. Staff was friendly! What else can a hungry customer ask for in the middle of Phoenix, AZ!"}
{"text":"Ordered a tostada and they gave me some weird shrimp fajita mix type thing?? I ended up just making a burro of it but it was cold and slopped together ...."}
{"text":"This is the second time visiting this location and the service was no where close to being good. Off the bat, the greeting at the drive through was shirt and abrupt. At the window, keep in mind rush hour (7pm) at that there was only one person handling drive through and the walk up window. Not the ladies fault but the owners fault for not having proper management providing hours to staff on a Friday night. Anyway.....the person tells me the total and it sounds off, I proceed to ask what she had for my order and she couldn't tell me. So I place it again at the window only to be cut off with the first item of my 4 item order. I get the first item and tell her the rest of my order. 15 min later I get all of my food drive home to find out my order was messed up yet again....i won't be going back anytime soon."}
{"text":"What can I say, $ .99 and worth just that. So, if you come for good food, guess what. If you come for cheap food, you are in the right place. Salsa bar is good concept but that is all it is, a concept. Most bowls are empty. If you need napkins, you must ask, they are not self serve on those!! Go figure."}
{"text":"The food is not bad. But people working here really need to go learn how to talk to customer. Horrible customer service. Never returning back nor recommending to anybody."}
{"text":"The breakfast burritos are really good and you get a decent size burro for not too much money."}
{"text":"By far the worst Filiberto's I've been to! It's the closest one to my house and one of the few places open after midnight in Gilbert, so I've been by on and off over the past couple years. I'm just going to say it here and now, I'm addressing the past two times I've stopped by since they're the straw that broke the camel's back.

The first time I really had an issue was a week ago. It was Wednesday night/Thursday morning and my brother and I both had a craving for cheese quesadillas. It struck me that one of the few (and, honestly, somewhat bizarre) Filly B's that has $.99 quesadillas on Thursday instead of Friday was close to home, so I headed over with thoughts of greasy, cheesy goodness dancing in my head. 

I should've realized this was going to go horribly wrong when I pulled up to the speaker and had to wait five minutes for a guy to come out the side door and take my order. With my order placed, I pulled around to the window for my order. Where I waited. And waited. And waited some more. 

After about 10 minutes, the guy who took my order FINALLY came to the window so I could pay for my food and head off. And proceeded to dick around with the system and apologize profusely to me in Spanish. 

I'm not pissed off about the Spanish part, which did help make what should've been an easy transaction ridiculously difficult, because, y'know what, it happens. And, okay, I'm deeply questioning the manager's decision to put someone who doesn't speak English on the window in Gilbert, but that isn't this guy's fault. No, the part that pisses me off is that no one apparently taught him how to use their system. Which added another 10 minutes to my wait time. 

So once he finally manages to figure out how to ring up my order, he gives me my total. Which is $7 and change. After having to show him on one of their take out menus that, no, it should be more like $2 something because it's after midnight on Thursday using the tiny amount of Spanish I know and a lot of pointing, he finally rang it up properly (which took another 5 minutes) and I was finally able to head home.

You would've thought that after that I would never go back, but I figured I'd give them the benefit of the doubt and see if they're still decent during the day.

I work out at the gym across the parking lot and had a particularly grueling session and desperately needed something to eat (which, alright, I know, Filberto's after the gym is pretty much cancelling it out, but you don't exactly do smart things when you're hungry). And considering it was Taco Tuesday, I figured, hey, what the hell, tacos are good. You can't fuck up tacos.

Oh how I was wrong.

I ordered two chicken tacos, a cheese quesadilla (because I am a creature of habit), and an horchata. The quesadilla and horchata were fine. The chicken tacos, on the other hand...

Well. The first one was fine. The chicken was a little dry, but that's something that's easily fixed with copious amounts of salsa roja. But the second one...ugh. Two bites in and there's something wrong. I don't know if it was cartilage or what, but it was absolutely disgusting. As tempted as I was to go up and request a new taco after picking through and finding more of the mystery substance, I didn't since it had put me off wanting anything they might serve with chicken.

TL;DR: Drive thru sucks and takes forever due to poorly trained staff. Food is sketchy as hell at times. Consider me a lost customer."}
{"text":"Food is alright. Not the best but it's tolerable when its 3am and you're scavenging for food. Horchata isn't half bad though so i might come back"}
{"text":"Food is as you'd expect-'but don't bother asking what's on anything. 3 people had no response so I needed to look it up online.."}
{"text":"Much love to the Fili-B's that saved me from hunger after Red Bird Cafe starved me of breakfast.  The register girl was friendly, spoke english, and the food came out quick.  It was as good as always.  A sausage burrito has never tasted as good.  Thanks Fili-B's!"}
{"text":"I put this review together carefully to be fair to everyone. I have a negative peed I spit ion to filibertos in the past. I I live nearby and eat here often. I they are a 24 hour fast food restaurant. That said the food quality and service is well above average. I I do need to pass on a warning  the management believe everyone is out to rip them off.  keep your receipts. I went their one night right before the dining room closed. I  got carryou.when I returned home I found the broken tip to a hypodermic needle in my food. The next day I returned it with the tip of the syringe you could see blood still in it. I Ibrought this to the attention of the person in charge who called the manager she came back and inform me there is nothing they could do without a receipt which I didn't have. when I first walked in that day I wasn't looking for everything but just need to aware what happens what happened so they could print something like that happening again I I got the feeling that they simply worried more about having to refund my $10 and whether they had a problem with the quality control and food safety. I understand on very rare occasions something tenable can happen even in a good restaurant what is unacceptable is the idea of loosing one sale and the belief everyone is out to get you, would keepp the managent from trying to correct whatever led up to my meal"}
{"text":"Fish tacos were actually pretty good. Filibertos is usually pretty below average, but this location seems to have some quality food."}
{"text":"This place just literally gave me a canceled ordered! I was wondering why the super nachos were done in less then 5 mins. I asked for no pico, got home full of pico, soggy nachos... cold! 

Don't come to this place unless you like someone's canceled food or whoever's food this was!!"}
{"text":"I am staying at the hotel across the street and didn't feel like driving.  The service was fast.  The food is really good too which surprised me given the negative reviews."}
{"text":"OK. I can't believe I've kept this secret for so long. I can't believe I'm about to walk out of yet another closet. But if I can help just one person...Yes. I crave. On occassion. Ok, like weekly. Filiberto's carnitas tacos. That's all I've ever had from here. Always drive thru. God forbid any of my foodie friends from yelp or chowhound see me. Two perfect little corn tortillas, filled with tender and juicy pork with a few crispy edges, cilantro and pico de gallo. Ole. I eat them in my car. With a measure of guilt and shame. But it just it makes it more exhilirating. And tastey. Ahhhh...a weight has been lifted!"}
{"text":"Seriously took 20 minutes just to get one burrito from the drive through!!! Haven't even taken a bite yet so can't comment on the food yet. Just super bugged that it's taking so long."}
{"text":"Straight fiya I go on the regular and they put up them numbers I love em yo everyone need to go to this one always so nice and amazing service put one up for the team"}
{"text":"Do not come here if you're a vegetarian. This is the third time that I have ordered a potato, egg and cheese burrito and I've gotten home and it's had bacon in it. It's sad because the food here is better than any of the other Filiberto's they're just careless. Brought the burrito back today, and the lady was really rude. When I told her that there was bacon in my burrito she said \"sometimes meat just gets mixed in\". I reminded her that people have allergies and don't eat certain foods. Then she opened up the burrito and said I don't see meat here, I had to pick through the burrito to show her the bacon. I'll never return."}
{"text":"Just drove thru this establishment this morning (July 22, 2017) ordered carne asada fries, not to bad, and a breakfast burrito with bacon, GROSS!   It consisted of browned, totally over cooked eggs, lots of browned over cooked eggs, way too many browned eggs! No potatoes, bacon was, eh...it was just bacon. Oh and cheese, wrapped up in a flour tortilla. It's places like this that makes me wonder why they are still in business. This place is HORRIBLE! I will not be back. I would love to know what thier food storage is like. It's all frozen I'm sure. Are thier grills clean? Hmmmm. Makes one think about what they are eating,  dont you think?"}
{"text":"Short and simple.....I love this Filibertos! If you want a real mexican meal for a great price, this is the place to come. You will receive a quick,big fresh hot plate every time.

 p.s. try the  Carne asada burritos :)"}
{"text":"iI have eaten here several times and never had a problem. Good food, clean, friendly staff.

HOWEVER! I will never be going back after the other day. As I write this I am in horrible discomfort from food poisoning after having the green chili plate. I wont go into details but lets just say my life sucks so much right now. My father accompanied me to the establishment and is also not feeling well from the carne asada plate that he had. We both have very strong stomachs, so in order to have a meal effect us so much speaks volumes on its own.

I would recommend great caution if still frequenting this place. I hope nobody ever feels or experiences what I have been for the last 12 hours."}
{"text":"Its not a big deal, its just fifty cents to check in.. but when we showed her my phone. She said we had to print it out. Whattt? Really? Smh. Anyways. Then I ask for extra hot sauce and lemon. She points at the bag and said \" in there\". Literally fighting me. It was just bad. Anddddd she forgot napkins.

Edit*
Came home and my enchiladas was cold. The cheese wasn't even melted.  :( ugh. im so mad."}
{"text":"This location has been best Fili-B's in the city. I have gone out of my way to eat at this place. They have come to know my favorite the Carne Asada Fries with Enchilada sauce or an Arizona Burrito with Guacamole"}
{"text":"My fiance and I just left there. We are drunk and happy, so most food, at this point, would be pleasing to the palate. 

However, as we sat there debating the 17 pounds of inedible food left on our plates, here was our conversation:

\"We just paid $17 for this shit?\"

\"Yep.\"

\"Should we take it home to the dogs?\"

\"I don't really feel comfortable giving it to them, do you?\"

\"Nope.\"

And so then, we threw that crap in the trash can.

That about sums it up. Next time, I will indulge in Jack in the Box tacos: 2 for $0.99."}
{"text":"I honestly cannot believe this place has 4 stars. If I could give zero stars, I would. The \"owner\" woman would not even get off the phone to take my order. When I did order, she had the audacity to speak negatively about me in Spanish, thinking that I couldn't understand her. She made fun of my boyfriend's birth defect right in front of us. When we asked for the owner, she gave us someone named Carlos phone number. We called and he said SHE is the owner. Clearly she gave us a number simply to get us out of the store, rather than handle customer complaints the proper way. Our customer experience was so terrible we left before even getting our food. Save your time, money and sanity and head to Juliobertos right down the street!"}
{"text":"The food is ok at best. It's convenient so we've had it a few times. Last night I ate the rolled tacos with rice and beans. 5 hours later I was hospitalized at gilbert mercy. Severe food poisoning. I will never go back again.  I'm wondering if anybody else got sick last night from this particular location."}
{"text":"I've gone here a few times the food is just ok for the most part.  What I don't like is the upcharge they add on things and never tell you about until you look at your receipt--has happened twice to me.  If you charge extra for certain things let me know about it first.  

Another issue is the attitude that you get from the workers there.  Ummmm $10 for some crap that you call tacos and served with a side of attitude? I will NOT be returning."}
{"text":"Bomb tacos cool staff. Lady at the counter was super nice, even though she had her hands fully. The tacos were fresh and the shell was still hot from being fried. The shreaded beef inside was seasoned well and the beans and rice were and excellent topper. Over all best Filiberto's I have been to. Also not shady like everything else around this neighborhood."}
{"text":"I have had a love-hate relationship with this place (specifically this location) for a long time. I love this locations horchata. It's different than other ones. I've gone there JUST for that. After last night's meal though, if I ever do go back and am disappointed, it will be my own fault for going.

I have spent about $100 over the past couple months here on three separate meals. You'd probably think that I got a lot of food and drink for this money, but no, I really didn't. For example... last night I ordered five rolled tacos (beef taquitos with cheese on top), a Texas burrito, two large horchata drinks and two churros (which were not sweet at all and had NO cinnamon or sugar on them). For this, I paid $24 and change. Pretty sad if you ask me. I could have (and should have) gone to a nice sit-down Mexican restaurant. It would have cost about the same and I would have been much happier with the food. Seriously, where does Filiberto's get off charging $1 per \"rolled taco\"? These things are tiny and worth $0.50 at most. You can see how cheap they are too in their coupons. For example, if you check-in on Yelp, you can get $0.50 off! Ooooh!!! Wow!!! How generous of them!!!

The food quality here is questionable, they charge way too much for it, probably pay their employees minimum wage (customer service here is TERRIBLE) and all the while, the owners must be making BANK. I will not support these people anymore, and I recommend that you don't either. I'll figure out how to make horchata myself."}
{"text":"Worked late at work tonight decide to go there and get me a burrito and taco. Went through the drive-thru, pull up to the window the lady tells me how much it is, I gave her my card, she has it back then I asked for a jalapeno. She tells me I can't have one because I didn't order it at the speaker. She said she has another person behind me, I look behind me there's nobody behind me and the chef is just standing there. Very disappointed!  I should have just asked for a refund it went somewhere else."}
{"text":"I love Filly B's! I'm usualy a Country Burrito fan, but I tried something different today and it was still delish! Nice guy working the cash register. It's close to my apartment and open late."}
{"text":"Good old Filiberto's!  Filiberto's was actually the spot where I had my first ever California Burrito (San Diego, CA) way back in the day.  While not my favorite taco shop in the land, they will do in a pinch.  Fast forward to present day in Phoenix, and I had a craving for some tacos.  I had read somewhere that Filiberto's has deals for \"Taco Tuesday\".  I pulled up their website and it said that tacos were $1.49 on Tuesdays.  I drove down here for lunch to grab some of those $1.49 tacos.  

I pull up to the joint, and to my surprise, there is a sign on the building that says \"$.99 tacos\".  What, what?  $.99 cents?  What, what?  Thought I had died and gone to heaven!  I pull into the drive thru and order 4 shredded beef tacos.  Pull up to the window, pay the lady my $4.30, and am handed my bag of tacos.  About that..........I noticed right away that the bag was super light.  Like, really, really light.  I was just praying that the tacos were even in there!  I pulled over to a spot in the parking lot and was going to eat them there.  I opened the box and sure enough, there were 4 tacos, but they were THE SKIMPEST tacos I had ever seen!  The tortilla was regular hard taco shell size, but the mid section of the taco was beyond skimp.  Maybe 1 oz of meat in each one, some shredded lettuce and a couple of strands of cheese.  Seriously!  Look at my pictures! The flattest tacos I have ever had.  You literally had to crack and pry them open to confirm that there was anything in them.   Even Jack in the Box tacos are fatter than these ones were!  I took a bite into them and the taste was good, but it was 90% fried tortilla.  I ate all 4 of them and could have easily had 10 more.  Yeah, that skimp.  

I hope and pray to God that these tacos are only this skimp on Tuesdays.  If these are the regular hard shelled beef tacos they sell at normal price, it is a complete rip off and I would ask for my money back and never come back.  I wasn't expecting too much for $.99, but even at a buck a piece, I don't know if they are worth coming back for?  I do like that they had a drive thru, and I'm sure I'll come back here sometime for a burrito, but as far as those tacos go....you have been warned.  Order at least 8, lol!"}
{"text":"I go to filly B's with the understanding that it's junk food. Pure grease and a guilt pleasure for many Arizonans. This time however there was a bone in my shredded chicken taco. Probably won't be going back for a long time needless to say."}
{"text":"Back when I lived in Phoenix, I used to come to Filberto's once in a while when I was looking for some decent fast food Mexican.  Upon my return to Filberto's a few days ago, I was so disappointed when I ordered Chicken Quesadilla to-go and received an unappetizing mess.  It was a monstrous tortilla shell uncut, folded over multiple times in the to go box. If that wasn't bad enough, the quesadilla was missing the sour cream and guacamole and had a clear, slimy, rubbery, circular, unidentifiable object inside.  Yuck.  1 star"}
{"text":"Rude service. I dont feel like im a difficult customer at all to deal with- not at all a picky eater, and I try to have a cordial demeanor (as I would with any other human). Yet, the cashier's have typically been blatantly rude. On one occaision, they had charged me for someone else's order, and somehow it was my fault. Accidents happen right?  Anyone can have a bad day. Unfortunately, I have found a pattern of rudeness over the last couple months of regular visits, and this last time was enough to prompt a yelp review. I often walk away feeling like i had just completely inconvenienced them.  

If i didn't love the food, and the location wasn't so convenient for me, then I'd never go back."}
{"text":"Very disappointed! Me and my boyfriend always go here for Bacon Breakfast Burritos , and they are Usually amazing! But the past Two time we got them the Bacon is so under cook that its horrible and I end up taking all of it out. No one wants white/pink Bacon...."}
{"text":"It's our favorite neighborhood stop on a busy day. The place is always clean and the staff is always friendly. And the salsa bar is amazing if you can find the time to eat inside."}
{"text":"So I love burritos and will try one at just about any Mexican fast food place. I know what to expect when I eat at those places and know what to expect from Filibertos but this Filibertos should be closed down.It was horrible and nearly inedible. I really love food and usually can deal with some bad stuff but this was just disgusting. The tortilla was overcooked as well as everything else inside. The meat was horrible and very low quality. Be sure to avoid this location at all costs. Could not finish my food and it gave me a sour stomach throughout the night into the morning."}
{"text":"We got there at 11:45pm (they close at midnight). And when we pulled up they locked the doors and turned off the \"open\" sign so we couldn't go in and get food!!! I wanted my burrito!!!!"}
{"text":"I liked their tortilla for the bean burrito, but I've had better beans. The shredded beef taco was pretty good. They didn't have enough meat on it though. For fast Mexican food it's fine. Close to my house."}
{"text":"Been here probably 6-7 times and pretty consistent food.  Better carne Asada than your typical Federico's or filebertos. Ground beef tacos solid too. Get those on a Tuesday .. Only $1 each. Staffs friendly and food is good .. Would recommend."}
{"text":"Filiberto's on Main/Longmore is a great place to order when your not in such hurry, otherwise you'll be late. The food that they have is not bad for the price, but the customer service they have, is just bad!. You drive up thru the drive thru, cashier shouting \"can I help you\" and rushes you with ur order, then you drive up to p/up window and drive away with the wrong order :/ If I wasnt on my lunch break, I would have turn back to have the right order."}
{"text":"I skipped lunch and was running around between Downtown and our training center near Metrocenter.  I know I can always count on this location for a good quick bite to eat.  And it's conveniently located near I-17. 
On this visit I decided to get their Monday 99¢ special which was 3 rolled tacos (beef).  I also picked up a carne asada burrito for dinner. 
Luckily I had cash. They dont take credit cards and charge you 60¢ to run your debit card. 
I pulled up to the window and picked up my order.  Nothing special other than good quick mexican food."}
{"text":"Yet again.  Same order (Arizona Burrito and three Rolled Tacos with Guacamole), same deliciousness.  How can you do this to me for $6.31?  It's just not right!  I'm going to get fat.  Delicious food shouldn't be this cheap and come from a drive through window.  I don't even have to pull the toddler out of his car seat.  10 minutes round trip and I'm on the couch, beer in one hand, burrito in the other Real Housewives of New Jersey on TV.  It doesn't get any better than this."}
{"text":"I stopped by this Filibertos after a massage at SWIHA starved to near death (not really, but it felt like it) to get a burrito to eat on my way to hi-lites. I chose an Arizona burrito filled with chicken, rice, sour cream and something else (not beans though which I forgot to add). 

At first it had a nice citrusy flavor but pretty quickly it got old and I was tired of eating a lemon burrito. To make matters worse it was full of what we call \"funny chicken\". You know. those weird pieces that are so chunky and chewy and grisly they're like bits of plastic. I'm used to the Ahwatukee Filiberto's where's there's no \"funny chicken\" in sight. Once I got to the salon I threw most of it away. I should have stuck with the vegetarian burrito. What was I thinking?"}
{"text":"Just came in here for a quick lunh whole my vehecle got worked on across the street at discount tires. Ordered a grilled chicken taco ,  fish taco and a small order of fries.  Everything was delicious. The cashier was very friendly ,  I've never been full off 8 bucks and my stomach feels fine."}
{"text":"Went here this morning... Easter with my man who never ever wanted to try it. I've been to a couple before but this one is right in a great location and I wanted a torta. Got a very large machata torta which was good. The man got two bean and cheese burritos. He didn't realize how big they were and only had about 3/4 of one before he was full. The torta was average and the burrito too. So basically this place is your average Mexican place but nice people"}
{"text":"If you really hungry, and it's really late, this is the only place you should go. Beware though, you'll start going at all times of day to get your fix, even though there are better option out there for any other time of day."}
{"text":"This Filiberto's is one of the best ___berto's in town.  In particular, it blows away the nearby Eriberto's on 7th St & Bell.  

Phoenix n00bs will have to decide whether they like this style of taqueria at all. It's the real Mexican food, in my mind. And for the initiated, the byzantine collection of Filiberto's and *berto's look-a-likes makes for an interesting hobby of experimentation and evaluation.  Some people love to take up wine as their culinary passion. But I'm drawn to the in's and out's of the 24-hour Mexican taqueria world. I'll publish a magazine on the topic someday."}
{"text":"This is a decent Filiberto's.  Certainly better than the abomination on Apache Blvd.  But it's not nearly as strong as some of the Phoenix locations, specifically the one at 19th Ave & Dunlap.

Ranking the various Filiberto's and its numerous imitators is an important exercise for taqueria fans in Phoenix.  Serious connoisseurs of 24-hour Mexican food need to know how to avoid stale torillas, under-stuffed burritos and slimy chicken."}
{"text":"Tough to rate this place.  Fish tacos were delicious but they are served in a pile of hardly edible grease and slush.  Still a good value, even after throwing away all the slush.  Staff decently nice.  Place was clean.  Would only go back if I really needed to."}
{"text":"Since my last review things have changed...

They no longer have the 99 cent burrito on Wednesday. It is now $1.50 bean and cheese jr burrito, and it's only this location that has changed. So now the burrito is tiny and you pay more. They also used to have Saturday and Sunday kids meal special but got rid of them because kids weren't getting them, adults were... Seriously, does that even matter? Anyway, it seems like new management has taken over and decided to change everything. I don't know, all I do know is that they prices went up and the food items got smaller. It doesn't seem like the same place my husband and I went to almost every Wednesday for 5 years..."}
{"text":"Ok, I know this is not the Salty Sow, but for a late night box of beef nachos it was darn tasty.   I asked if the beef super nachos or the carnitas plate was my best bet.   My friend behind the counter quickly answered \"Nachos!\"   I went with the nachos and a Pibb.  I was impressed.  Bean had good flavor, the pico de gallo was fresh and crisp.  Heck, even the guacamole was probably homemade.  Oh, the steak diced up on top was super tender, not ground beef.  
Now this is a massive to go box full of food for $10ish.  That is where my only complaint comes from, too much food!  It was a challenge to mix it up and get a little bit of all the topping on each bite."}
{"text":"Very happy that I decided  to give this place a try good food very clean restaurant eating area & very friendly works always offering a smile as you walk in the door!"}
{"text":"So my husband and I are vegetarian and tonight (1:04am) we didn't have much choice (we tried) so we got there a line (not uncommon) then we placed our order carne asada fries no carne asada. First the fries were old and like reheated, so much so that you can taste that stale after taste. Second seem to me like if we said no carne asada the price for it should reduce being that the carne is the star of the show well nope still got charged full price and had to request beans. Okay so that says two things really they don't care for the customer to not charge accordingly, and that if we did eat meat we'd pay all that money for a really poor order of the carne fries. To make matters worse it wasn't like we were the only car there was a really line and plenty of dine in traffic (at 1:04am) so after waiting our turn to not get fresh food says a lot about the place. Lastly, service was poor. No greeting at either the intercom (placing the order) nor at the window to pay for our food. I have to say we choose these spots over more commercial cuisine like oh say chipotle because the food is supposed to be better, but clearly that's not the case for now the Fliberto chain. On the upside they do have a semi spicy guacamole sauce that made the dish without it we would have ultimately wasted our money and guys I hate doing that!"}
{"text":"This Filiberto's has:
* 24h Dining room
* Restrooms available
* Has a value menu 
* No commentary chips at this location

The food varies slightly from each location. It is dependable good food. Not mass produced.

Friendly and respectful service. The cleanliness of the restroom is above market standards.

I recommend this place ever if you go a little out of our way to casually dine here."}
{"text":"Everybody was very friendly here. My kids loved the beef tacos and I had a chicken salad. I would probably order tacos or enchiladas next time instead. One of my sons didn't like what he got first and they were happy to exchange it for something else.

My kids had so much fun playing at the playground. I'm so glad to have somewhere close by where my kids can eat and play."}
{"text":"Definitely coming back. It's quick and authentic.  I can't believe I didn't come here sooner."}
{"text":"Honestly the worst mexican fast food restaurant I've ever been to. First of all I ordered Carne asada fries and one shrimp taco. The lady asked me what taco? I said shrimp and she said okay.. I figured she understood that. Secondly, I waited 18 mins for my food to be done. That is way too long for a fast food restaurant I mean they should have it called slow food paced as a snail restaurant. Lastly, I got my food but I didn't bother enough to check till I got home because I got off work pretty late and I was super hungry. I checked my food when I got home and they gave me the wrong taco ughhhh. They gave beef taco which had very less meat in it. I took a bite the taco tasted old and it wasn't even crunchy, it was like eating chips that were stale and old. I threw that away. Next I tried my Carne asada fries. Gosh it was disgusting, it's like they put the whole bottle of salt in these fries and the meat. That's all I could taste. Never again will I go back and order food/ eat here. I'd rather have taco bell and it's a lot more cheaper too. Just an advice please listen to your customers order on what they want. It sucks getting the wrong food when you think it's what you wanted to eat. Horrible experience"}
{"text":"Just went and had stake quesadillas it was awesome the service was good. Welcome to Anthem."}
{"text":"I love these restaurants I eat in them all over town! The food is always fresh always delicious and always fast! The daily specials can't be beat the special today is 3 rolled tacos with cheese and at this location they serve you a little salad! Delicious I will be back!"}
{"text":"This place can't even get your order to you correct. I ordered 3 BEEF tacos receipt clearly says 3 BEEF tacos and I'm eating PORK tacos. Avoid go to another one because clearly they don't care and only want to bait and switch for more profitable product."}
{"text":"Food here is good, predictable, sometimes enjoyable, but most often falls short. Today I had the chile relleno meal11 which cost just over $8 dollars.  Not cheap but not overly priced either. It's really a good plate but the
Chili Rellenos had very little flavor. They are served with rice and beans,  and salsa.  You get some guacamole not much and a little sour cream and a gigantic tortilla. One thing's for sure if you eat everything on the plate you will not leave hungry. But as I said there is not much flavor to this meal. Thank goodness you can have free salsa green and red and chili and hot carrots. For a quick meal, I say go ahead. But for anything else, I would look elsewhere!"}
{"text":"We were looking for a hearty late-night meal after being picked up at Sky Harbor from LA and my friend that lives in town suggested Filiberto's. Now we have Alberto's in LA and my friend who grew up in Los Angeles said this was the equivalent so I had to try it. We ordered at the drive-thru. We got 2 carne asada nachos, 1 carne asada burrito, an order of rolled tacos and 3 churros. The total was around $33.

The nachos were great. The meat was thicker than I expected cuts of asada. That was good to see and it tasted great. The cheese was good, the chips were crisp, the sour cream, guac and refried beans were all quite delicious. Adding some green salsa gave it a nice kick. It was a more than generous portion. I was starved and I could barely finish that order of nachos. The rolled tacos were good but the guacamole looked suspect. Not sure why it was a darker green color on top and brighter (more normal guac) green underneath. That was weird so I ate around it with trepidation. I didn't like not trusting my food. 

Service was friendly at the drive-thru... especially since we added the churros when we got to the window. The nice lady said no problem and added the churros to our total. Food was good. It was rather tasty... It's just that mystery guac, I dont know. At least I didn't get sick... That I must say."}
{"text":"The food was pretty ok BUT too many beans and barely any rice and the food is wet. I've had better but It was ok"}
{"text":"Their bean and cheese burritos are the best as well as the cheese quesadillas!  They are really big and totally worth it.  Some of the other things Ive ordered have been a hit or miss.  The fish burro is really good but Ive also gotten it again and it was a let down.  The soft fish tacos we also not very good,  Ive only gotten them once though.  The only reason im giving it 4 stars is for the bean burro and the cheese quesadillas.  Its pretty clean and the service is friendly and decent for the most part."}
{"text":"Jessica has to be rudest person at this place.  We have been going here at least 3 times a week and the last 2 times she was so rude that we will not be back!  Orders have been wrong, items left out of orders but they were fixed..not by Jessica. Prices keep changing and its frustrating!  In the last 2 weeks same item has changed price 3 times depending on who took our order.  There are lots of .....bertos to choose from.  If you want decent service and consistent prices....avoid this location!!"}
{"text":"25 minutes in drive thru. Ordered beef tacos. They tried to hand me chicken at the window. Gave it back after honking the horn and waving arms like a maniac. 3 people back out behind me. 20 minutes later got the order. Wouldn't have waited if I already hadn't paid.

WTF FILIBERTOS?"}
{"text":"I've only been to the drive-thru at this place and always order the menudo on the weekends. The problem is they always run out by the early afternoon . . . so I call them to save an order for me.  They are always cooperative and the menudo is stacked full of tripe.  The broth is perfectly spiced-up.

I cannot understand how they can sell this wonderful dish (actually a quart) for $6 and change including tax.  Spectacular!"}

{"text":"Chicken enchiladas okay first time an service was good.
2nd time messed up my order even though they property read the order back to me.  What i got was cheese ala carte for for well over $6 bucks.  I feel ripped off and robbed.  Maybe if she wasnt blabbing to cook while my order was being made it would have been done for what i played for.  Just moved here but will never go back.  The mex place that is close by is WAY better. Wish i didnt give them second chance to take my cash...shame on me."}
{"text":"FAIL!!
This Filibertos openend recently in place of Church's chicken. They still seem to be having problems with the chef as I walked in on the conversation where the teller was explaining to the cook how to make the chicken. Not a good sign at all. I decided to get the green chile as I typically do, it came out in less than 2 mins (not a good sign at all).
 Wow the chef had just gone to task with adding salt and making the chicken mushy. 

Royal fail .. Avoid like a plague.. I know its a filibertos but atleast get the franchise recipe down. Now as to the freshness of the product.. well that is something I never question at a Filibertos"}

it's salad bar, not so much: rancid sauces(the verde and red ones) and salsa..... do not touch..."}
{"text":"Not bad. Not great. Good sized portions. We ordered the chips and guacamole and it came nacho style. It wasn't a bad thing, just different."}
{"text":"The food is really good, but I am disappointed with the price increase. I would have given 4 stars if it weren't for the price. I prefer the breakfast burritos or Carne Asada Fries.

For the price point I definitely won't be coming as often as I used to, there are other places that have really good food for a better deal."}
{"text":"Greasy spoon drive thru mexican food. We'll indulge in a breakfast burrito every now and then.  I wouldn't suggest the chorizo BB....so greasy it was just gross and I'm no health nut. That thing is not fit for human consumption. This is drunk food."}
{"text":"If you're a huge fan of being treated like garbage and getting your order wrong, this is your restaurant!! I ordered a quesadilla with cheese and green chiles and got bell peppers on a tortilla. Now I'm not saying bell pepper isn't a green chili in a sense, but I'd figure that Hispanic people would know the difference. 
What added even more to the three experiences we have had at this location was the foam Tip Cup taped to the drive thru window. When I didn't drop my change (after being rudely addressed at both the intercom and window) I got a scowl and attitude from that point forward. 
What a winning team they have over there! Let me tell you! I am a calm positive person all day but I've never been so challenged to slap on a smile after leaving this dump. 
Beware that this location will leave you with a feeling of rage whenever your visit. If that floats your boat, you'll absolutely love it!"}
{"text":"Extremely salty carne asada tacos! The meat was inedible it was so salty and I'm a fan of salty foods so that's telling you something. The horchata was bland and watery. Tables were dirty but that wasn't so much of a big deal I guess. Oh not to mention over priced! I spent $22 on a crappy burrito and 3 tacos. Come on! Would not recommend! I don't understand why this chain is so popular. It's NOT worth it."}
{"text":"Carne asada fries. jesus christ. eat, watch reality tv, pass out. repeat."}
{"text":"Filiberto's is my favorite Mexican food chain in the valley. This newly opened store lives up to the Filiberto's name. I get the breakfast burrito often. This consists of scrambled egg, peppers, onions, cheese and your choice of ham, sausage, bacon, or chorizo. All this wrapped in an enormous flour tortilla served steaming hot. I mean you can't pick it up with your bare hands hot. The condiment bar offers red and green sauce. not too spicy with a good flavor. The sauces compliment the food very well. 
There are a lot of copycats around the valley. I've never been to any of those other \"Berto\" restaurants because I'm completely satisfied with Filiberto's price and quality."}
{"text":"Day or night.  These burrito's are amazing.  The first and last think I eat when I come home will be Fillibertos.

Welcome to flavor country."}
{"text":"How can this place have only two stars? What else do people want? It's delicious, greasy Mexican food. Sign me the hell up.

I recommend the breakfast burrito. I normally get it without ham.  I find that the saltiness of the meat detracts slightly from the overall deliciousness of the eggs and cheese and pico de gallo which are blended to perfection."}
{"text":"This place is your run of the mill Mexican fast food joint. There are many of them out there and usually have decently priced food and quality ingredients. This place had some pretty good tacos. Apparently they do catering, I don't see why not... I'd order it up for a work event or something."}
{"text":"This place is the worst!! Everytime i come here they get my order wrong it is almost as if that's their thing, I have to check it b4 I drive off in which case I hate to even tell them they got it wrong because they are so rude they might do something to my food. Me and my husband came to get breakfast burrito and I got the country burrito w/bacon, they forgot to add the bacon oh but they sure did charge me for it!!!!! Get it together Filibertos"}
{"text":"This place has the best lengua (tongue)of any of the filibertos restaurant. And the chicken enchiladas are great too.I would if given them 5 stars but there was one occasion it was thick and not as well cooked maybe the regular cook was out that day. Other than that best one I've tried in the Phoenix tolleson area."}
{"text":"No attention paid to detail here. My taco salad was soggy, ordered a shrimp and cheese quesadilla (after asking if they could make it) and got home to find out there was no shrimp in it. Prices have gotten so steep for what you get. Will never return again."}
{"text":"Food was great but I only go to filiberto!! If you want real authentic Mexican carne Assad this is your place not the other bertos ! The I Normally go to the one in Mesa where the horchata is a little sweeter but this place is a lot closer to me and the carne Assad is off the chain an must try!"}
{"text":"While it may not be my top choice for fast and cheap Mexican food, you just can't go wrong with Fili B's.  Plus they're open 24/7!!"}
{"text":"Asked for a carne sada burrito with only guac no pico and I get pico no gauc girl payed 8 dollars for a burrito and now have to pick the pico out. Cool. Will not return."}
{"text":"It's Filibertos. What more can I say? Sometimes ya just gotta have a super nachos...other times you crave a carne asada burrito. 
Usually late at night.  Right?
Filibertos will never be fine dining, or even middle class dining, and the Juliobertos down the street may do some things better, but right now I can taste their cheesy, gooey, saucy, cheese enchiladas."}
{"text":"This place gave me food poisoning!!!! Ruined my filibertos experience forever. I will never ever ever eat here again."}
{"text":"I'm an out of towner...east coast that is...so what do I know? I travel alot and rely on yelp for ideas regularly. Craving Mexican type food I found Filiberto's was highly rated and nearby.

I ordered the following:

- Carne Asada taco
- Fish taco
- Green Chile burrito

Long story short....Carne Asada was ok...I mean better then taco bell but not hot & fresh. The fish taco was a total waste of money unless you like cabbage & onions. Now, the Green chile burrito was from a different place. It was hot, fresh, saucy and tasty. Maybe a tad heavy on sodium but hit the spot. So, save your money, get the green chili burrito for $3.72 call it good."}
{"text":"The food is good but the wait is always way too long. Anytime of day they are slow. There's no reason to go to Filibertos cause there are other places nearby.
Yet I find myself here again waiting and waiting and waiting...."}
{"text":"This is the longest drive through I've ever been to, consistently. It's always at least a 30 min+ and the staff is never friendly. I don't know why I still come here other then the fact that it's the closest filibertos to my house."}
{"text":"I've never waiting in a fast food drive thru for so long. It's been at least 20 minutes and that's just the time that I waited at the window for my food. Guess 6am is a bad time for breakfast burritos."}
{"text":"This is an update to my previous raving review(4/2/15).
This Filli's has changed. Their ingredients have changed, their potions have changed, and their recipes seem to have changed as well. I'm am most disappointed with their red enchilada sauce... It's awful. Almost enough to ruin an entire plate. Whatever management did has officially destroyed my favorite place in the valley. I will NEVER come back. The city has also made it practically impossible to get to this joint due to their poorly planned light-rail construction. I have years (15 +) of memories at that location and its a travesty it is gone now. The building is there, some of the same workers are still there. But it's not Filiberto's.. All good things must come to an end, and it is with a heavy heart that I tell you that 'that' time has come for this establishment. I am on the hunt for a new fast-mex place, but not in west Mesa."}
{"text":"Best Fili B's in the valley! I am a regular of almost 20 years and love most every item on this menu. In general, filibertos is hit or miss depending on which location you go to. But this place takes pride in their store!! Know what your getting into, and go get yourself one of the under 5$ meals, or cheese enchiladas, or whatev!! Extra red AND green sauce, and don't forget the horchata!!! 
Thanks Fili B's for all the great meals!!!"}
{"text":"I go here at least a week, the burritos are on point. I always order a side of chips. The best thing about them is that they are warmed up in the fryer. Not anymore! I was told they are bagged up now? Really, I said? Can you do that for me? No we can not. Funny thing is, I seen the cook fry up some chips for someone else...guess I have to find a new go to spot"}
{"text":"I was very excited when they opened this new location! But sadly, it's terrible. They are very unorganized. They mostly get my orders wrong. Most of the drive thru employees never smile or are rude."}
{"text":"Quick lunch but, don't  expect too much. Served with un-melted cheese on top of beans and rolled tacos."}
{"text":"I live in the islands and frequently goto to this filibertos around 12 am to 3 am and they are never open and they never close at the same time. Don't say your 24hrs when you treat it like burger King and having it your way."}
{"text":"This location is horrible.  Gave me the wrong food once and this time i ordered, get to the window and the lady asked me what i ordered and just then put in my order.  You can't ask for a specific number or color hot sauce because they don't listen.  Get home and the lettuce was tossed outside the taco, which was burnt enough that the meat was as hard as the shell.  Carne asada fries are nothing great.  Food is over priced, don't waste tour time or money coming here."}
{"text":"Worst refried beans ever. They tasted like flavorless mush. No spices or salt to be found. I've never had Mexican food that was so bland. We are limited on this side of town when it comes to Mexican food that is open late. Take more pride in the food you serve."}
{"text":"I have visited this establishment 4 times in the last 3 weeks, and that's only if you count the first time I visited the establishment each day.  3 out of the 4 times my order was wrong and I had to go back and have them correct my order.  I clearly asked for no beans and identified that it was a food allergy, so it was real important.  Each time I would find beans hidden in my food.  I am very disappointed with this location.  Others that I have been to are pretty good.  I will not be going back after today.  The employees are not even very apologetic when you go back and explain the issue.  Very Poor Customer Service."}
{"text":"Contrary what other says about this place.  I have decent experience each and every time that I visit this place no matter what hours that I show up for their food.  24 Hours restaurant is a very difficult business endevour to take to keep their meal consistent throughout the day but this place have done so.  You are not going to get a Michelin meal from here but friendliness and decent meal 24 hours a day happens here at reasonable prices as well as all the ethnic drinks are fully stock.  It is a sure bet for people who are always on the go."}
{"text":"Customer service is horrible.... i eat here twice a week mininmun cause its 30 seconds from home.... but the customer service is just despicable.  Decided ill drive 60 seconds now to rolibertos to get my mexican fix."}
{"text":"Rude ass bitches work here!! They serve more lettuce in your tacos then anything. And when you call them out, they bring some bullshit meat out in a little salsa cup! Bitch I ain't asking for free food, no mas lo que es!! Never again will I go back. You just lost a good customer because of the rude ass bitches working there."}
{"text":"Horrible service and the chorizo and egg burrito was disgusting.   Would not recommend or return."}
{"text":"I don't really know what the heck I just ate here, but I thought I had ordered a Carne Asada burrito.  They gave me a bunch of meat, guac, salsa all wrapped in a fried tortilla...where is the produce??  It tasted like a gigantic greasy abomination...im sorry but that is not a burrito.  I'm not sure of the quality of the meat, but I think I'll try and find a better place to go for my lunch break."}
{"text":"Never been here before but you Yulian was sure patient and friendly and helped me go through the menu. I am kind of picky. Anyways he sure hooked it up. Glad I came here this place is excellent!

I'll be back! ' thanks Yullian!"}
{"text":"I was in the area and didn't want to cook dinner so i figured i would check this one out, even with the roach stories. I had just been to the one on southern and dobson, so this was my second Filiberto's experience. The drive-thru was super fast and the person taking the orders was really nice. I was home and finished eating before i ever would have made it through the drive-thru line at In-N-Out. I got #15 carnitas. Huge serving size with some corn tortillas. You can't get that much food for that price at a another fast food place. I think i'll try the nachos next time."}
{"text":"Always pleased and a bit surprised at how good this location is. Fast food Mexican is often iffy. The food here is always good, reasonably priced and I get my order quickly. Had a burrito, taco and quesadilla and very pleased. Not fancy but good food."}
{"text":"Food was excellent and they give huge portions!  It appeared clean.   Service was very gracious."}
{"text":"This place is terrible!! They close early always even though they say they are open!! Worst Filibertos in the state of Arizona!!"}
{"text":"So.....we came hungry. And they sure do give you A LOT of food, which is good since its kind of expensive ($10.99 for a chile relleno plate, and $9.99 for a burrito & taco plate), but they pile your plate for sure.  Many places skimp on the rice. They do not do that here!Its definitely filling, but if you want awesome Mexican, I'd stick to the small mom'n'pop/hole-in-the-wall food places. I rated it a 2-star since they give you a lot of food."}
{"text":"Two stars because the food was good. Then again, I'd been craving a particular food item for a long time, so I might have been too happy finally eating it to really complain too much. 

The service, however, was atrocious. It took the workers several minutes to attend us even though the place was literally empty of customers. I'm not joking. One guy even passed by the cash register, looked at us (a dirty look on his face, it seemed) and just kept walking! Then, when the girl who finally came to the cash register, she didn't even bother to greet us! She just scratched her head (in a restaurant! She was in the kitchen and came out and scratched her head in front of customers! Talk about unsanitary, and rude!) and asked what we wanted. No, \"Hi, welcome to Filiberto's, what can I get you?\" No. All she said was, \"What do you want?\" Not only that, but she totally messed up ordering for us! 

We waited while three groups came after us, ordered, and got their meals before us, (about half an hour's wait) before one of the workers asked what our order was. Turns out, they hadn't even STARTED our order! When we finally got our food, that girl (I'm going to call her Bonquiqui cuz that's how rude she was) didn't even pause as she just plopped our food on the counter and continued scratching her head into the kitchen! No, \"Sorry for making you wait\" or anything like that! Any other restaurant would have given us free soda or a mini taco or something as an apology. Hell, I would have been satisfied with just a verbal apology, but Bonquiui didn't even seem to care. I bet she was angry that we interrupted her texting or whatever. 

All in all, the food was passable, but the people suck. They either need new management to keep Bonquiqui and her angry cook friend in line, or just get friendlier, more alert people to work there."}
{"text":"Yes I should know what to expect as it is not my #1 choice, but it was the only thing open after hours.\"Over the weekend I went to Filibertos and purchased 1 super nacho and 1 carne asada burrito total, according to my receipt was $17.26, Monday morning I checked and it showed $27.26 on my bank statement! I called the 6022540317 number listed on the receipt and it shows DISCONNECTED! took time out of my day off to drive there and to only be told that nothing could be done and to wait for Olga the manager to see if \"maybe\" she will be in today to get my $10.00 back. I do not have time to drive back and forth as this is not near my home, will be taking this to the BBB It is only $10.00 but still I wonder if I am the only one that has had this happen to."}
{"text":"I hardly eat at these places but today I was craving an horchata to go. Lady in the front was super rude with an attitude! Simply because I said lite ice! She acted like she didn't hear me so I repeat my self in Spanish and she said \"too late\" never coming back here !"}
{"text":"If you're planning to roll through the drive-thru. Plan at least 10-15 minutes MINIMUM. No joke. They are EXTREMELY slow. I only come here when I have the extra time to sit in the drive-thru. Otherwise if you're in a hurry do not bother. They are very very slow. Oh and after almost 20 minutes I get home to discover my cheese quesadilla is a steak taco. (Don't eat meat)"}
{"text":"Extremely slow. 3-4 cars pulled to the side so you can catch up on orders?  At the very least have parking spots set up and tell them where to park, so they are not blocking everyone in. Mass chaos!!!"}
{"text":"Great Mexican food, cheap specials, friendly employees, bottomless chip and salsa bar, great location right next to lightrail.  Lots of seating options.  This is my favorite Mexican place in Phoenix.  NOTE: Avoid during lunch rush, because of it's location, it gets swamped, and there is a huge line for the salsa bar."}
{"text":"Just sat at the drive through for 6 minutes without being acknowledged- said hello into the mic several times- pulled up to leave and they finally acknowledged me-- pulled right through- I'll go someplace that wants my money"}
{"text":"I don't understand why the low reviews food is always consistent and the lady at the drive through is always nice, wished they gave you the free soda when you went through the drive thru as well as sit down.  Also there is more salsa options inside that they don't mention."}
{"text":"This Filiberto's almost got 4 stars from me and here's why:
1) The location itself looks \"fancy\" as another Yelper had mentioned, compared to other Filiberto's I've been to; and it seemed pretty clean AT FIRST GLANCE.  
2) I came in with a coupon (from Avondale) for the Big Juan.  It wasn't on their regular menu, the girl had no idea what it was, but she went to ask the cook if he could make it anyway.  I'm so glad they did that for me because it was a combination of mouthgasmic goodness! Carne asada, rice, beans, bacon, guac, sour cream, and ciliantro all in a giant burrito!  The bacon might have been a bit much, but it was good for the first two bites. 

But why did I bring them down to a 2.5, you might ask?  I think I must have been super hungry when I first walked in, because it wasn't until I was halfway through my burrito when I saw how filthy the lid was on my cup of horchata was... dust and particles that look like crumbs.. and colors of stickiness... Makes me question what kind of care was put into my food.  Do they just leave their ingredients laying around in the open for particles of random crap to fall into or let flies take their craps? 

Probably won't be going into a Filiberto's for awhile unless I'm being dragged into one. Bumped my rating up to 3 stars since this was my first disgusting experience with this restaurant... hoping they redeem themselves if I just so happen to pop in here again in the far future."}
{"text":"Some days it's good but most of the time, it's not. The carne asada is more like shredded beef and has too much liquid in it making it mushy. Not coming back to this one."}
{"text":"Perfect breakfast burritos for the road. I love the country burrito paired with an horchata. Staff was friendly and the drive thru moved quickly."}
{"text":"I've been to many different Filiberto's locations around the valley, and this one has always been consistently good.  There are rarely errors with my order, and the food is always fresh."}
{"text":"I have a very personal relationship with breakfast burritos and carne asada fries.  This place really brings a smile to my face.  I also just discovered a burrito called the Patron Burrito which is awesome!!  Another new favorite!"}
{"text":"My old school late night 'bertos was in North Phoenix, but this has become my handy work 'bertos.  

Confession:  Every once in a while I get a hankering for a greasy quesadilla dipped in hot sauce - at 7am.  I know it's weird.  I can't even explain it.  But say 3-4 times a year the urge strikes and it strikes hard.  This place has satisfied that urge in style.  As a 'bertos quesadilla fan I have to say - be prepared to swab it down with some napkins.  Because it is 100% real cheese so it can be a greasy mess.  

The same could be said for much of their food.  It may be greasy - but at least it's real.  You know what you're eating.  One of their cheap combos is an easy 2 lunches.  And while this place definately falls into the \"fast food, crap food\" category vs. the \"hole in the wall, heaven\" kind of food - it's a great alternative to have."}
{"text":"Outside seating only, which leads to some entertaining people-watching.  The other customers at the restaurant when we came by for some comida included three potential drug dealers, a guy who wandered up wearing a marijuana shirt, and a woman who left the possible dealers angrily shouting \"You can shut the f*$# up, I am the bride of Jesus Christ!\" as she wandered off down the street.  The tables in the seating area hadn't been cleaned recently, and cups containing some strange liquid were sitting on our table as we ate.

That said, we had some very friendly service at the window, and my cheese enchiladas were acceptable for the price we paid.  My husband's carne asada was probably not made from the best cut of steak, since it was chopped up into small pieces instead of being served as a strip.

Overall, I would look for a hole-in-the-wall Mexican place in this area of town instead of returning."}
{"text":"So I live and work right next to this location. It is hands down, with out a doubt, the worst Filiberto's location in the valley. Your employees can't get the simplest food orders correct and have even over charged for specialties orders on numerous occasions. Tonight was no exception. At this point I will no longer go to any Filiberto's location. You claim to better than all of the other \"Berto's\" but that simply isn't true."}
{"text":"The Rolled Tacos with cheese and guacamole are always amazed, but the bean burrito was bland and runny. The cashier was less than friendly. I measure fast food cashier's against In and Out and Chic-Fil-A because they have the best customer service. 

Rolled Tacos 5     , -1 running, bland burrito, -1 resting bitch face cashier ="}
{"text":"I have been dining at Filiberto's for 20 years. I was pleasantly surprised to see a new 24 hour restaurant just opened. Obviously I had to give it a try for lunch. The service was friendly, courteous and prompt. The food was great!"}
{"text":"Love Filiberto's - I gotta come here at least once every time I'm in Phoenix.  This is the place I compare all authentic taco stands to, and the one that introduced me to what good authentic Mexican fast food should be!  To me, most of the Filiberto's locations are pretty consistent so this review is really for any of the locations, but I'll have to agree with others and say that this location is arguably the best and I'm fairly certain this one was my first, and you know what they say about that!  

Fresh hot tortillas, huge burritos, great salsa bar, cheap prices, open 24/7 what's not to like?  Love the packets of hot sauce they make fresh at every location and give away free and I've yet to find a sauce like it anywhere else, it's that unique.  I always asked for about twice as many as they give ya with every order.  I've tried the other copy-cats of the Filly-B name and they weren't quite the same.  Filiberto's is one of my gotta haves that I miss most about Phoenix and since it's open 24/7 I'll always hit it late night after everything else is closed to get my fill."}
{"text":"Chili rellano burrito with their green sauce, you'll drive across town to get it one you've tried it! 

Huge burritos."}
{"text":"Took a little while for food but tasted great.  However, I asked if horchata refills were free and the girl said no so I said nevermind. Unknown to me, the owner or regional manager or someone happened to be standing behind me and heard. Asked for my cup and walked back and got it, said it was on him.  Nice touch, and prompted a review. Love that kind of service."}
{"text":"There were bugs all over inside the restaurant, the parking lot had garbage all over, the food is disgusting"}
{"text":"I was so excited when they opened this new location!  The food was good the first few times I ate here and no complaints except for my last visit.  I ordered my usual egg and bacon burrito that is usually delicious but this time it reeked of fish! It was as if they cooked it with really old grease that was used for seafood...I was grossed out for days.  I ate a partial of it and regretted it big time. I won't be returning, very disappointed! :("}
{"text":"Meh, this Filibertos is ok. I like them as a chain, but this specific location is always extra slow-even at the drive thru. It's also more expensive then the other ones. And they don't offer the California or Arizona burrito, which is my biggest complaint. The regular size is too big and extra expensive here. Overall, it's alright"}
{"text":"The food here is great and I love it but there is one specific cashier that always ruins your food and then makes it seem like it's a joke. TIP: BEFORE leaving double check your food !"}
{"text":"I love this Filiberto's not only is it conveniently located behind my house but it's so delicious and has a great salsa bar! My favorite thing to get is simply the bean and cheese Burrito so simple yet so delicious! Also can't beat the dollar tacos for taco Tuesday! Perfect food to cure your terrible hangover :-)"}
{"text":"used to go all the time for $5 chimi combo... until they stopped including a drink and added gross, watery, shredded beef.  ugh :-()-----"}
{"text":"Came by last night at around 9:30 PM with my fiancé, my brother, and his wife, and got some food to take home. When we got home and began digging into our meal, what we found was much less than satisfactory. Not only was this food similar in taste to eating a salt lick (saltiest Filiberto's meal I have ever had in my life) but it was also wrong in every way possible. I ordered two bean and cheese burritos and my fiancé ordered a carne asada burrito with beans, cheese, guacamole, and pico de gallo. None of our burritos had cheese and my fiancé's carne asada burrito didn't get any guacamole or pico de gallo, all of which we had to pay an extra dollar for each for each burrito. My brother also ordered a chili verde burrito and a carne asada burrito as well. He didn't even get what he ordered; instead, he got a chorizo burrito and some kind of red sauce meat that we couldn't even pin as to what it was. The only one who got her food the way she ordered it was my brother's wife, but, as with everything else, it was still saltier than the Pacific Ocean. As such, in the words of The Simpson's Jeffrey Albert (The Comic Book Guy), \"Worst Filiberto's ever!\""}
{"text":"I usually go on Power rd one of fastest service and taste way better than this one. Me and wife was stopped quick bite after my kids went urgent care... I was ordered and been waiting for 30 mins and I went ask where my food! Said there a lot people and there no one here... they should put orderly who first order and keep listing who ordered but she put me hold and focus on drive Thur for a 30 mins. It's not worth it to waiting for that.."}
{"text":"Filiberto's is pretty predictable... Greasy semi decent Mexican food served until late hours of the night. Their red sauce is delicious and I usually buy it and bring it home and use it for my own Mexican dishes or for eggs. This location just got a grade of D by the board of health. Eat at your own risk"}
{"text":"Food was just OK. Steak burrito was kind of chewy, and my wife's taco salad was good but had barely any lettuce at all. They were nice about adding more. I'm not sure if the Air conditioning was broken, or if it is always too hot in there, but it was horribly muggy inside."}
{"text":"Great they are sometimes mean but the food is good but the prices are sometimes very high"}
{"text":"My favorite food is Mexican...with that being said... Idk what this is. Unless you are drunk and in college I am not sure why you would eat this. I feel so guilty because this is my first negative review on any site... The service was good. I couldn't stomach the lengua burrito or dry rolled tacos!"}
{"text":"Mex food lunch craving. 

Was satisfying, would suggest sticking to tacos as my enchiladas were less then undesirable.

Heavy salt in beans. 

Ended up only eating a taco and it cost me $9."}
{"text":"Total see you next Tuesdays. They charged us for 4 things... two in the bag. The orders we had were wrong. I hope the manager fires the women on the night crew. 

Horribly incompetent and mean.

I love me so fillibees... but wtf. Listen to the other reviews. AVOID AT ALL COSTS."}
{"text":"Going to fili-b's you already know you are either drunk or just want some Horrendous Mexican food. I've been going to filibertos in the area for the last 17 yrs... I gotta say this one is the worst.. I've had several wrong orders and I speak spanish, when I call they yell at me and make me feel like I should apologize... I will never go back this location main and power consistently gives you the correct order of shitty drunk food..."}
{"text":"This place is great. We ordered a bunch of rolled tacos with cheese and guac, the California burrito, and one of the special $1.99 green chile burritos. We ordered to go. 
Came home with the food and found out that our rolled tacos didn't have guac on them, even though we paid for it. Food was good tasting. The lack of guac on our rolled tacos and guac gives this place a 3. Maybe I'd recommend."}
{"text":"I had heard about this great Mexican restaurant called Filiberto's. Some of my friends seemed to talk endlessly about how good of drunk food they have. Last night, I was totally sober and looking for some quick food while on a short break from work. I recalled this location and my friends' words that it had great food. I sort of forgot they said 'drunk' food. 

I ordered an enchilada and burrito combo. I really don't know what to say about them besides it was remarkably unremarkable. I am not much of a cook myself but I felt that I could have made the same exact meal with minimal effort, possibly even make it better.

I doubt I'll ever go here again. If I do, I will make sure to be at least slightly intoxicated. Maybe the food will taste better then."}
{"text":"So I decided to come back and check and see if the service was just a one day thing.. got the #5! When it was ready she said ohh I forgot to tel them it was for here.. I said.. can I get plate... and just a chuckle... I asked if it came with chips and a drink and that was no.. Soo I had to spend another $6 on those 2 items on top of a $9 meal.. the enchilladas came out hot.. but the beans and rice were def microwaves it seemed like it!  I guess my first review is correct!!  This place isn't for me, and needs to lower their prices for the quality and service!!"}
{"text":"Drove through today, what a difference a day makes.
Taquitos underfried, chewy.Rice seemed a day old. Crunchy not soft and fluffy.
No consistency here, hope they get their act together, but not holding my breath."}
{"text":"The good... Lady at the counter was very nice.
The Bad...5 hours later I am having digestive issues. Heartburn, etc.
I have been blessed with a remarkable digestion. Eaten anything all over the world. It's rare that problems arise.
Had huevos rancheros, beans and rice. Eggs were over done and scorched one side. Didn't look good. 
This place is not busy like it used to be. I have to wonder about freshness, and turnover.
On top of all that, it just didn't taste good. Hate to scratch another place, but I'm done here."}
{"text":"Food taste just like any other location. But what is different about this one is the horrible service.  I have only been there twice and both times I have got probably some of the worst service I have ever experienced. Taking 15minutes for a bean burrito? Then on top of that someone who storms off when you ask him for hot sauce then basically throws it at you when he finally gets it to you. Definitely the last time I'd ever go to this particular one. Wish I could do more than write a review but doesn't look like anyone's had any luck."}
{"text":"Beef Tacos A+.  I love this place when I'm looking for some quick, awesome Mexican food."}
{"text":"Nope. I got a taco and enchilada combo. The taco dripped massive amounts of grease. I have no idea what the meat was, but it wasn't chicken, lol. For some reason, the cheese was crispy and burned....did they deep fry the whole thing? The cheese inside of the enchilada wasn't even slightly melted. It was just a tortilla with cold shredded cheese and some bitter red sauce. It's less than 2 minutes from my house and open late, so I was hopeful. Until I can find a better, close, open late alternative, I'll stick to Chipotle or Senor taco."}
{"text":"Very fast, friendly and yummy!! This is my favorite Filiberto's restaurant out of them all! They always take care of me and my order is always right!"}
{"text":"My husband and I come here quite a bit.....it's always very clean and never too busy. The customer service isn't the best, their not rude, they just aren't very outgoing. They are however, very efficient! The decor is really nice, not tacky like many others."}
{"text":"Filibertos in general is an old reliable, you know the food, and what to expect. It's nothing fantastic but it's better than some of the other burrito places. This was my first time at this location. Went through the drive thru I had quick and friendly service, didn't experience some of what I read on other yelpers reviews. My food was hot, was given napkins and the guy at the window was very friendly. It's not somewhere I'd go out of my way for, but I wouldn't say I wouldn't go back."}
{"text":"Although we have been in the Phoenix and surrounding areas several times we had not tried a Filiberto's before tonight. On a whim and since there is not much choice in Buckeye we decided to give it a try. 

First if this is cleaner than other Filiberto's, YIKES. This place was not clean. 

I ordered #5 combo and it was a lot of food. 2 cheese enchiladas, beans & rice. The only thing hot was the beans. The red chili had a rather strong vinegar taste but after a few bites I got used to it, it was not horrible but not spicy either. My husband had the Green Chili Burrito, which was very hot (temp not chili) and he enjoyed the flavor but it was much more tomatillo than green chili, we are from NM and we know green chili. The burrito was huge and had lots of very tender chucks of pork that had been simmered in the sauce. 

We also ordered chips & salsa, we got a mound of chips with what we would call pico de gallo all over the top, mostly just onions and cilantro with a few sad looking pieces of tomato thrown in, but very wet and it sogged up the chips really quickly. 

We love good Mexican food and won't be going back even though it is convenient it just wasn't very good."}
{"text":"Absolutely the best filiberto's around. Super clean, friendly staff, and amazing super rolled tacos!!!"}
{"text":"Great little Mexican fast food restaurant with fresh ingredients and large portions for a small price. Will be back!"}
{"text":"The food was OK.  Beef burrito as big as a baby.  Rolled chicken tacos with good filling and toppings.  Guac and sour cream.  Good prices.  Large condiment bar.  Counter help was a little sleepy.
There were 2 homeless guys in there keeping things neat and organized.  I guess they work for food?
You have to be buzzed in to use the bathroom."}
{"text":"My favorite one. Mi d you it's slow but worth it. Less fancy than other filibertos but I do like the flavor.:)"}
{"text":"Never disappointed in their food. I mean come on it's Filiberto's you should really have high expectations. On average I will get there Junior chimichanga or there are ground beef burrito. Both of those come with a drink and are super cheap. Let's not forget $.99 taco Tuesday!"}
{"text":"Great Carne Asada Burrito, but was treated like a slug off the street.  Female cashier showed no care, friendliness, or welcome.  I ate in house, but they gave me a take out order.  I won't come here anymore."}
{"text":"At one time this was a place to go grab something quick and have a rather tasty time doing it. But now it just sucks something awful. 

The lobby is stuffed with the usual 19th ave and Bell crowd, you know the type, hookers, meth users, the homeless hordes looking to get a free water and maybe hassle you outside for some change. I know this hood from living among this filth for about 10 years now. The inside lobby hovers around okay to almost gross from day to day and the employees seem to be bored with their work or just bone idle. It wasn't like this until as of late. Everything changes for the worse I guess. 

Their Super Nachos are a pile of chips with big spoonfuls of beans tossed in the middle and then some meat sprinkled on top maybe just a lump of pico in the corner, some DARK GREEN splooge splattered all over everything, to just a touch in one corner. Not much about it is supreme or super. It just bites the big one. Horrid and a tragic mistake mostly. 

Their rolled tacos used to be really good. Now you have to crack the stale, dry. hardened ends off these microwaved critters before you can cut your gums to pieces. The cheese is usually in one corner or not at all. You should never ask them to remove anything or to skip an ingredient, this will surely result in a ungodly amount of whatever you don't want to be placed front and center. Generous amounts of malice and self loathing will ensue when you discover what has been done to your order when you get home. You drove up and ordered, it must be your fault...and it is.

Their carne burritos used to be a glorious feast wrapped in wax paper and delivered on the glowing hands of the burrito god himself. Now it seems they are tortilla wrapped in tortilla smothered in bad nightmares and disappointment. If I were to show you a picture of one of these saucy sexy beauties circa 2004 you would know what I am talking about. They were the be all end all of my lunch hour eats, an amazing treat. The photo now shows a withered pallid dough wrapped in dough. A has been in itself, puny and full of pico I surmise because it is cheaper than carne, or whatever the meat is now. 

Maybe if the owners were to pull through their own place and eat there sometimes, or if they were to send a couple secret shoppers plodding headlong into the drive-thru, there would be a change at this place. But I really doubt that. There is nothing that will bring this back to it's former glory. 

I don't expect anything near or on 19th ave and Bell to be anything but a glass smoking, whore hopping, drug snorting, good time. But this place kind of represents the generally malaise of  the area, in style and in cuisine. Avoid at all costs and if you must out of curiosity's sake take the drive-thru and keep your expectations super low. 

Anyone that rates this place over two stars has a head injury and needs to be looked after, or works for the owners. And that is a fact!"}
{"text":"I don't care what anyone says, I love Filiberto's.  Carne asada burrito, Arizona burrito, green chile, carnitas, machaca, chorizo, carne asada fries.... I love it all.  I'm not crazy about the cheese they use, so I usually order without it, or end up scraping it off. It's not gross, they just tend to be heavy handed.

Nothing beats a late-night Filiberto's stop, or a morning-after hangover buster.  And, their horchata is my favorite! If they delivered, my life would be complete."}
{"text":"Late night staff is very rude. Looked at me as I walked up to the counter, said nothing. I ordered a burrito and it came out within 90 seconds. I wasn't given a number like I usually get at every filibertos location. I didn't think it was mine because it usually takes much longer. I asked the only other customer in the building if it was hers because no number was called, just \"carne Asada burrito\" no eye contact...  before I could finish asking the other customer(a pregnant lady, sorry for trying to be courteous) if the burrito was hers the lady at the counter jumps in and said \"yeah, carne asada\" with a rude, condescending tone. 


Very rude compared to other filibertos, not my first bad experience here."}
{"text":"Came here at the request of my co-worker. I don't mind a good late night filibertos run but yuck this was yucky. The rolled tacos were and always are stale and they taste like the oil in the machine needs to be changed. I used to work in a kitchen and I can tell. Place is dirty and old. Never coming to this location again, and it smelled inside and out."}
{"text":"$6 and change for a breakfast burrito...that's insane.  And no, it wasn't $6 worth of good."}
{"text":"Mediocre food.  Place was clean so that was good.  Salsa bar left a lot to be desired"}
{"text":"Burritos served cold. Sauce is watered down and has no flavor. Better off going to taco bell and I can guarantee the food  better. Wish I could give 0 stars because they don't deserve any. I reported them to the health dept. They need to be shut down"}
{"text":"Taco Tuesday ha ha!
Went bout noon and purchased 5 tacos. ($5.33)
Dried out taco shell, non-descript meat, 
ordered beef but I think they mixed chicken in there too. A few strands of lettuce and cheese and cold to boot! Dam
Called and spoke with Marlene (mgr) and she would replace the tacos free of charge on my next visit. Not going back!"}
{"text":"I'm going to go ahead and rate this like the FAST FOOD restaurant that it is. The food is good as far as fast-food goes, and I have always had a great experience with the staff (even on my 3am trips). Regarding the getting sick thing, personally most fast food leaves me spending more time in the bathroom than normal, so I cannot comment on that. 

I would recommend it if you are looking for fastfood, but it is fast-food."}
{"text":"Service sucks. Food is decent, except they never get the order right.  Every time I have been there I have either been treated so poorly for no reason, I would rather go to a different location so I don't get snarled at by the staff."}
{"text":"Initially coming into this Filiberto's for lunch, I thought I had accidentally stumbled into a Halloween themed haunted house.  I check my phone for the date and see that it is too early for Halloween.  Interesting.  Someone tried to pass this place off as a restaurant.  Wow, you got me going, good job.  Scared the shit out of me!

Let us hit the brakes and back up a bit.  The parking lot here has had zero maintenance performed on it.  I think this building used to be an old Carl's Jr. or Jack in the crack that was poorly renovated and has a really piss poor paint job on the exterior.  Potholes in the parking lot made me think my truck had a flex capacitor in it and brought me back in to time to when I was in Philadelphia, dealing with the world's shittiest roads.  Nope, still in Arizona.  I assume there is a lobbyist in the vehicle alignment business working hand and hand with this establishment.

If you can get through this minefield of the parking lot, might as well go for broke and come into the restaurant.  There is an entertainment factor due to the signs all over the place yelling at you to not fill up your cup with soda if you have not paid for it.  Classy.

I don't expect fillet mignon from Filiberto's but I also don't expect to have the cook stare at me the entire time I am waiting for my food.  That guy looks really pissed off.

Been here several times and wanted to enjoy the chip and salsa bar with almost zero chances to seize the opportunity.  The chips that are left are broken if there is any in there at all.  Ask them to put more in, the cook will just stare at you.  No chip refill.  There is a plastic fork laying in one of the salsa containers.

The air conditioning control unit is hanging about a food off of the ceiling only suspended by the failing duct tape trying so hard to defy gravity, like Sylvester Stallone trying to save the girl in the Movie \"Cliffhanger.\"  The walls here looked like there was wallpaper ripped off and never replaced.  A few of the seats have no padding on them,  but plenty of graffitti to read to help pass the time.  My particular booth on one visit read \"Fukkin Crakar\" written on it.  Maybe I should bring my Mom here for lunch.  I can teach her all there is to know about racial slang.

The bathroom is constantly trashed with no soap and am amazing amount of piss all over the floor.  No worries, there is yet more gang graffitti written in languages I can't read all over the stalls which I assume is not a positive message (like \"have a great day, champ!\")  There is no sign to indicate the men's room from the women's room either, the first time I was in there the men's room sign was sitting in the urinal.  Think they replaced it? 

Bagging on Filiberto's is easy and I know that, but this particular location seems to really go out of their way to have a beat to shit restaurant.  It is more depressing than the condition of a landscaping pick up truck I once owned.  

If it wasn't for the Tuesday 99 cent menu... well...I really don't know how to finish this sentence."}
{"text":"This Filibertos is now called Rivas Mexican Food

Not wanting to cook and tired of fast food a quick trip through the drive thru it was.

Ordered a steak, egg and cheese burro, large cheese quesadilla and a pint of rice.

Service was quick but lady at the window had major attitude when we asked for green sauce.

Food was hot and burrito was filled to the breaking point. One word. Tasty. Egg wasn't over cooked and the carne tender with more cheese than necessary. Standard quesadilla and orange colored rice that for some reason or another my kid loves.

Rivas is like most Berto brothers restaurants without the berto name. Food is consistently average and a touch over priced. They do offer a value menu with a specially priced item each day. Tuesday's are tacos and Wednesdays are bean burritos.

It's easy and my family loves this type of \"Mexican\" fast food."}
{"text":"This particular filberts was terrible! I order two carne asada burritos and they come with guacamole and Pico. My burrito was fine but the other was full of runny guacamole and it looked like guacamole soup. I have never before seen that much guacamole in one burrito. When I told the young lady at the counter she gave me a dazed look like she did not understand what I was saying and it was not a language barrier issue. I expressed that there was way too much runny guacamole and when my son took a bite it felt like he had nothing but liquid in his mouth. She again just looked at me like I was speaking Chinese. She did not apologize or empathize with me at all,  just kept giving me a bewildered look. She did ask if I wanted a new burrito but with a scowl on her face . I said no thank you as I know what cooks do to people's food when they complain and I did not trust their cook.  I will never go back to this Filibertos!"}
{"text":"This location takes a long time preparing food for customers waiting INSIDE the restaurant, presumably because they are serving drive thru first.

This is problematic when it is nearly 100 degrees in the restaurant in the Summertime.  

The food is mediocre at best.  At worst, it gives you a bad case of the runs.

I won't ever visit this location again.  Another Filiberto's?  Maybe. 

My advice?  Get what you want, but get it in the drive thru.  And, do not EVER, EVER, EVER wait inside here in the Summer."}
{"text":"After our absolutely awful experience next door at the terrible Red Bird Cafe, we were famished.  We walked right in to Filiberto's, ordered a couple breakfast burrito's and a soda, were treated with a smile, and got our food all in a matter of 5 minutes.  Plus, we got it all for less than what we were about to spend next door.  I haven't had any form of Berto's in years.  I honestly can't remember the last time I ate at one.  Needless to say my first bite into my steak and egg burrito was so nice.  It was meaty, cheesy, and stuffed full of eggs.  It was the perfect foil to a cold, rainy, blustery day.  The only thing I wasn't diggin was the messy floor.  Oh well, the food was delicious and I got a Diet Coke.  I was a happy girl."}
{"text":"This place rocks, it's definitely NOT Taco Bell, and that is why I love it sooo much! Pay attention to what I'm about to say and you might learn something. Last Saturday I ate at.... Filibertos tienda mexicana de tacos. ¿Por qué hay tantas personas de raza blanca aquí? Gringos les gusta comer en Taco Bell, así que ir! El bar salsa tiene pepinos frescos en rodajas, pimientos jalapeños, rodajas de limón, salsa picante, salsa suave, y la salsa de tomatillo más sabrosa - tan bueno es adictivo! Tuvimos las tostadas y los taquitos laminados con queso y guacamole. Oh mi dios, mi boca es muy sabroso nuevo - Tengo que ir a Filibertos ahora! Este lugar es excelente, el personal es amable, y usted debe sentirse satisfecho cuando se vaya. ¡Volveré!

See what I mean? Make sure you try the tomatillo sauce! Este muy bueno!"}
{"text":"Cheap good Mexican food with good value for the money.

Chorizo Breakfast Burrito is excellent as is every burrito that I have had. Sausage, Ham, Bacon, Country or any breakfast burrito is very good. I also like the green chili burrito which has a very mild kick to it. Their tortillas used for the burrito are very good, they seem fresh and locally made.

I believe this location is 24/7 in the drive thru."}
{"text":"Not even worth one star... My son was born with a birth defect and went in to grab some dinner... We live in Arizona people, even white people speak your damn language!! Why would you make fun of him and say horrible things about his looks!! He is an amazing person!!

Please do not visit this place or buy their food here at Kingbertos!! We are calling for a boycott of this place!!!

Unleashing an enormous social media request to get the word out!!!

#downwithkingbertos"}
{"text":"I usually love Filiberto's but the last few times I have been there, the quality of food has gone down. Their beans tasted so watered down. I got the Huevos Rancheros this morning and it was so nasty. It looked like they took old pico de gallo and plopped two fried eggs on top.  My husband got the machaca breakfast burrito and there was barely any meat and the eggs were way overcooked. Super disappointed. Also, I noticed they put red tape over the \".99 cent\" taco sign and wrote \"$1.19\" with black marker. Seriously? This is a super reflection of your business. Take the extra .20 cents you are making on your tacos and buy a new sign!  super ghetto!"}
{"text":"Lol that is the worst food .. Salt and shit food if that's your thing.. Oh that's even if the girl in the drive thru Evan understands English .. Then they get upset when you can't understand them no receipt so who knows maybe she's stealing from the place hell I don't know but the food is not food it's salt on a brick the same stuff I give my horses"}
{"text":"Can't stand ordering a crunchy taco only to get soggy one because the grease and moisture's permeated the corn shell (usually within a minute of getting the order). This doesn't happen at Filiberto's like it does at Senior Taco. So happy to have a Mexican eatery in Fountain Hills that I like!"}
{"text":"unlike my friend RZ i somewhat like this filibertos...somewhat

i somewhat don't mind the yelling of numbers. hispanic girls yelling is usually a turn on to me. so she can get huffy and yell numbers, names, insults, oh papi's  i don't care. i like it.

what it is lacking is a good carne asada burrito. i don't know why all the drive thru ones i have gone too get it right..this one is just wet and sloppy and missing some flavor...dunno. plus the pico gives me heart burn."}
{"text":"You can't go wrong with Filiberto's when you are craving a taste of something spicy late at night. Why? Because they're open 24/7 of course! That would be the main reason as to why I go here.
Other than them being open all the time, they offer decent service and typical Mexican food. Tacos, burritos, tortas etc., but my most favorite from here is Carne Asada fries! 
If you have the option to try out a new place, definitely do so. But if not, ole faithful Filiberto's is still here :)"}
{"text":"I have only tried their carne asada fries but they were pretty good. Their salsa was tasty, I also had tamarind water witch was very very sweet but it's ok I diluted it with water and it lasted even more."}
