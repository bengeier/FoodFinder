{"text":"Grand opening ... Grand closing !!!
Wanted to try this place and was really hoping we would find a great new place that we could return to . First red flag in a Resturant is how busy they are around lunch or dinner . Unfortunately this was Not a good interpretation of middle eastern (Persian) food.  As a middle eastern person ,I'm very offended by the owners attempt to sell a dish that is of very poor quality and taste. I get it , if ur not busy than its hard to put fresh food on a plate.  
1.Unfriendly register girl
2. Unclean (sticky tables , dirty floors ) 
3. Beef tenderloin is not fresh and not seasoned well . Tasted old, I had to spit it out .
4. Rice is only decent .
5. Chicken is seasoned poorly and lacks that flavor that should be in this type of chicken . Don't try a recreate the wheel by adding Rosemary where it don't belong . 
6. Bread was only cooked partially as one end was still doughy. 
7. When I asked bout gyro meat, they say it's pre-cooked . Gyro meat should come fresh as it cooks and turns .  
Good luck with this place as ur days are numbered for ur lack of care to the business, quality and taste.  I've noticed the owner likes to respond to reviews . Don't bother . Focus on delivering a better product. 
Don't worry , he responded . 
I asked for medium cook on the tenderloin and actually it was overcooked , not raw as u mention in ur reply . Good attempt .
Fortunately , I alone will not be reason for ur impending closure as u just don't care enough bout the food.  Best of luck to you ."}
{"text":"I was concerned when I first walked in with no customers inside at 6:30pm.  The counter girl was pleasant and the food tasted great.   I am very happy and will return in the future."}
{"text":"Big meat portions. Tiziki sauce with the fresh pita is yummy. Really nice employees. Fries are good."}
{"text":"So first the off I stood outside for 15 mins to try and receive my food. The delivery Driver never even delivered my food so I didn't get anything. I told her several times after 6 phone calls from her on where to go. When I called the business the gentlemen on the other end hung up on me. I called 15 times and majority of that was unanswered and several he hung up on me when I asked to speak with a manager. So now I have no food and rude employees. On top of that they still charged me for the food that I didn't even receive. I would really love to give this place a 0 star but unfortunately I can't. Please stay far far away from this business. They are rude and crooks!!!"}
{"text":"This is one of my husband and I absolute favorite places to eat, so healthy and tasty and my favorite is the chicken kubideh with rice and salad it comes with then a side of garlic to put on the rice and it tastes like butter but it's just garlic and so healthy and their cooked spinach is the most savory tasty thing. We literally eat there twice a week and feel so healthy and great afterward and the staff is so nice and the girl at the cash register is always so sweet and compliments us and is so helpful! She thought I forgot my tea and ran out to my car to give it to me, so sweet. This place deserves to be #1 in Vegas :-)"}
{"text":"Will not return. Employees were lazy and praised poor sanitation and hygiene practices. This place is empty for a reason."}
{"text":"My daughter and I have been trying to find a place in Vegas that serves not only kabobs but kubideh as well. We found this place and We were not disappointed!! We shared a 2 kubideh special where you can mix and match between chicken, beef, and lamb. We got chicken and lamb and it was cooked perfectly. The meat was tender and seasoned well. And it comes with rice, pita bread, salad, and roasted tomatoes. Only for $11.99. Definitely will come back soon."}
{"text":"We love the airport location, so I was so pleased when this opened, much closer to us!  I just took my niece there for her birthday and she loved it.  We had the kabobs, I had chicken, she had beef.  We were both pleased.  The kabobs were cooked perfectly, tender and made right when we ordered.  Next time I'll try the hummus as well.  I actually thought the staff was quite  friendly, it was a good experience.  We will be back!"}
{"text":"I am upping my rating too 2 stars since the owner contacted me and was very concerned about my experience. He wanted to come back in and give them another shot and also said if not he would send something to my home. The owner is a classy guy and tries to make things right."}
{"text":"What a SURPRISE!!!
Although the physical space is smaller in size, it is the only thing small in the whole place. Not only are the portions huge but so are the hearts of the owners Mozhgan and Turkmani. Seriously, after having  traveled and lived in the Middle East, the myriad of flavors that you experience here are some of the best in the world. The falafel, shish kabob and baba ganoush were  honestly beyond belief! If you are looking for amazing flavor, generous portions at a reasonable price and you happen to be in the Las Vegas desert, this place  truly is an oasis."}
{"text":"New place. First time here. Gyro salad was good with very generous portion. Kabobs are also nice sized but not outstanding flavor. Very hot in here though, 88 degrees. Came here for Shawarma Plus because Yalla closed, a little underwhelmed with this as the alternative though."}
{"text":"Ordered 4 Gyros though Uber Eats I received 1! So they conveniently removed 3 gyros from the bill and only charged me one plus the full delivery fee despite the fact I was trying to feed my family and had to go out my self and purchase enough food to feed my family. To the owners and Management. I am the Director of Operations for  a very large Franchisee in Food Service. I would have rained down thunder on a Manager of a Restaurant who attempted to charge a customer one penny for such a  egregious error with customer service like that in this town you won't stay in business for long."}
{"text":"This restaurant is not good. You shouldn't eat here. I tried this particular location because we used to eat at the one across from the airport. I like that location. This new location is not even like the other one. I went in at 6pm and should have turned around and left when I saw the place completely empty and the counter girl was just hanging out drinking a soda. 
As stated before she is not friendly. Hardly says anything at all. (This may be due to English not being her first language.)
Ordered a \"chicken tenderloin\" salad for 9.99. This salad is pitiful. 4 tiny, seasoned with lawry's season salt (very authentic Mediterranean spice) chicken pieces, coupled with a few slices of cucumber and canned Smith's black olives. (Very authentic Mediterranean veggie.) A tiny 1/3 filled salad dressing cup (about an ounce) and that's it.
No hummus. No peppers no feta no kalamata olives and most importantly; no bread.
You cannot charge this much for this plain and small of a salad.

I also ordered the beef tenderloin kabab plate for 9.99. Bland salty meat paired with dry tasteless rice and a burned to a crisp tomato. Also burned onions and scorched bread. No hummus. No sauce just dry tasteless \"Mediterranean\" food. 

Next I ordered the gyro (all take out btw) and just more of the same. The lamb is already cooked and pulled from the cooler and reheated. Dry, tasteless, no sauce included with the gyro. 
My takeout bag was tied shut. No sauces included and I guess I should have asked but what kind of place doesn't include it? 

For the $30 I spent I give you the advice to skip this place. As I paid I felt like $30 was a little high but I remembered the airport location was worth it. This is not. After I got home and we opened the containers I realized I had paid way too much.

Last thing. Counter girl isn't friendly. No specials at all or at least not offered. Also the a.c. seemed to not work very well. Very warm in the empty dining space and also I have no idea how they do shawarma as nothing is cooking on the spike and everything is in the cooler."}
{"text":"Had a beef kabob, an the taste was great. I will definetly go again. Strongly recommended."}
{"text":"Chicken shish kabob plate is my favorite, but all the kabobs are great ! Meat is perfectly seasoned and cooked, literally eat this once a week if not more."}
{"text":"I think this place is very good, and so does everyone from my company (we order lunch from there occasionally). I've only ordered the chicken kabobs and grape leaves, but have tasted other items. The staff is always very friendly when I've been there, so I have no idea why others are saying otherwise. 

My only complaint would be that their hummus isn't as good as other places nearby...but I think their chicken makes up for it. I would like to see this place succeed. I still go to the other Mediterranean places nearby, but this one recently has been my chicken kabob flavor of choice."}
{"text":"Yum! We really loved everything, except for the lamb meat on the Gyro. It was so overpowering with lime that I would pucker my whole face every time I took a bite. Maybe it was just an accident? I don't know... but I'll definitely give it another chance. The prices are also great!"}
{"text":"Hispanics should stick to making hispanic food. Worst attempt at Medi food, ever. The girl at the counter comes off as super rude too, but I think she's just shy. I wish Shawarma Plus was still there. I just wasted 15 bucks. Oh, and I just got diarrhea from the food-"}
{"text":"Nice place. Clean. The employee was very helpful making our selection. Food was freshly cooked and it was delicious very full of flavor. They deserve the 5 stars because there food is very good. They have an awesome menu and yeah maybe they take like 15 to 20 mins to cook your food but it's so worth it."}
{"text":"Very nice place and super dioecious. Mohammad such a great person. This is my favorite Middle eastern BBQ place in town."}
{"text":"DONT WASTE YOUR MONEY!Terrible service and terrible food. Not only do they give you a ton of attitude during the order process but they also can't seem to not burn the food no matter how many times I have gone in there. I'm done with this place and you shouldn't waste your money here."}
{"text":"Very clean inside but food it's too salty, fries soggy and weird sides. Wouldn't go back."}
{"text":"*warning*warning*warning*warning*
this place is over ratedand definitely over priced !!!  the food is very blan & blah tasting! the rice has absolutely no flavor! they give you a dry salad.....no dressing, wtf????? 
hate hate hate this place !!!
stay away !! you'll waste your time and money  

oh did i mention i hate this place? ( sarcasm )"}
{"text":"This is the first time I have ordered from this restaurant.  There was one kabob plate and two wraps on our order.  The lamb kabobs were over-cooked and dry. Plus sadly,  there was zero tzatziki to be found on anything."}
{"text":"Since my favorite \"Kabob Place\" closed because of recession, I've been looking for another decent Middle Eastern restaurant and by \"George\" I think I've found one. I've seen it for quite sometime but because we were shopping at Smart and Final, I decided to take our staff the Kabob Oasis...And we were not disappointed. The Gyros sandwich was da bomb! The Gyro meat was just how I like it, crispy on the outside and tender on the inside. They give you huge portions of meat and the bread was handmade in the restaurant to order. For $4.99 the Gyro sandwich was a steal. Only down side is they charge $2.50 for fountain drinks; a bit steep for a place like this. Anyways, we liked it so much we came back two days later and the food was still just as good. BTW: a side of Gyro meat was a great addition to any meat lovers. Also, the salad comes with dressing...not sure what the person complaining about dry salad is all about...All they had to do was ask. The people there are amazingly friendly. Oh, the other thing, we saw someone just order the flat bread fresh. I think I will try that next time. It's a hole in the wall kind of place so don't be too harsh on the appearance. The parking is lacking because of location. I hope they really make it because their food is actually really tasty."}
{"text":"Terrible service. Terrible food. Not fresh. I was so disgusted we will never eat there again. My boyfriend and I threw out our food. Dont waste your money or time on this place."}
{"text":"First impression when I walked in is how clean the place is. The front counter person was friendly and the food was really good. The meat was tender, the bread was soft warm and fresh. It definitely satisfied the month long craving I had for a juicy kabob."}
{"text":"PROS:
+ I love that they offer authentic dishes like the eggplant badjeman and mantu meat dumplings, which may arguably be their best offerings.
+ They use Halal meats and don't freeze or microwave, which is awesome. Most dishes are distinctly fresh.
+ Speaking of fresh, load up on their freshly made Persian taftoon bread. I can't get enough.
+ Portion sizes are generous, pricing is fair, and I like that I can order online through the Yelp app for fast and easy pickup.

CONS:
- Kabobs have been hit or miss, upgrade to the tenderloin style unless you prefer the ground meat kabobs which have been on the dry side.
- Dips also seem hit or miss? The eggplant baba ghanouj has been great but the hummus is lacking, on the bland side. 
- It's a minor issue but the cafeteria style warming trays behind the counter are overfilled with takeout boxes, straws, drink lids, etc and is messy and unappealing."}
{"text":"My husband and I came here a couple of weeks ago and it was fantastic!  Grilled to order and the bread was better than any other Mediterranean place we've ever been.  We both had the ground beef koobideh kabobs, very tasty.  We definitely recommend the hummus!  Now I'm back for the chicken shish kabobs and hummus to go.  Very pleased this place opened up."}
{"text":"Why don't I order from here more often when I'm getting delivery food! it tastes so much better and is so much more fresh than most other delivery foods. what?! it's easy to get veggies in me when they come from here. Yumm"}
{"text":"Food is ok. . I've had better at other places.  Customer service was horrible.  They were just standing there (mind you I was the only person there) didn't say a word. . So I asked out loud \"Are you ready to take my order because I've been standing here ready for 10 mins\". Wouldn't come back"}
{"text":"I just ordered from them via Uber Eats. I was surprisingly impressed. 

The pita is fresh and very nice and the quality and tenderness of the meat in the gyro was excellent. 

I will eat from here again, and I will definitely Lee using Uber Eats!

Cheers."}
{"text":"I like the food and the prices !! The Kabobs are pretty decent and very flavorful !! Should also try the Mantu and vegetarian choices with Dough (Yogurt Drink) !!! Wonderful !!!"}
{"text":"My office is next door so I decided to give Oasis Kabob a try. I am very impressed with the food. There was nobody in the restaurant when I went so I was a little nervous at first but I did notice that the place was nice and clean so I decided to give it a try. I got the beef kabobs and chicken kudibeh with rice and fresh bread. The meal was excellent. I especially like the green salsa they have as well. I guess being a new establishment the counter girl said sometimes its busy and sometimes its slow. Once the word gets out I am sure these guys will be doing well, especially since they cook their own bread on site."}
{"text":"Kabob oasis is delicious.. I took my mother there for lunch. She got the shrimp kabob and I got the Gyro. It was so delicious and fresh. The food was great quality. Friendly and courteous service. Definitely will be back. Thank you for a great dining experience!!"}
{"text":"We have been to a few Mediterranean style restaurants in the Las Vegas/Henderson and this BY FAR the best!  It is super clean,  the people are really friendly,  and the food is delicious!  Big portions!"}
{"text":"Was not greeted by any of the three people inside. When the girl came out from the bathroom the only indication that she was ready to work was her standing behind the register, silent. Seemed irritated that we were the only customers and interrupting her \"down\" time.  Good thing the food was great.  I had the lamb kubideh and my wife had the chicken kabob. both were cooked appropriately. rice was tasty and the grilled tomato was a nice touch. I also really like the green relish/salsa like condiment."}
{"text":"This place was an excellent choice! We tried the falafel wrap, feta salad, and hummus. The falafel had a great flavor and was not too gritty. They did not skimp on the feta cheese for the salad and it was also very tasty. The bread was the best as it is made in house and was being baked as we were eating, making the whole place smell so good. Definitely must try!"}
{"text":"I think this is a Persian style kebab shop. It's the little things that I love here: garlic sauce, bread made in house and the grilled tomatoes."}
{"text":"Ordered the chicken fingers and they were good up until I tore one apart and it was completely raw. The ladies in there were nice but when my bf took my plate up so show them she asked me if I wanted another plate, I declined. There are so many other Mediterranean places in town so I would not suggest this one."}
{"text":"I ordered the Gyro and although the flavor was alright, I couldn't eat it properly because it fell apart as soon as I lifted it up. The stick they used to hold it all together basically punctured a hole where it split down the middle. Even if it didn't split, there was just too much packed in the gyro or the flatbread was too small. Even if flatbread was super soggy and the fries were all hard.

Definitely not my first choice but not entirely bad."}
{"text":"They don't have grilled onions! More of a fast food feel to this place. Service was quick and friendly. Nothing special strikes me when I think of this place. Come hungry or go home. Serving size is pretty big but that's typical/expected."}
{"text":"I would say okay mediocre food. Every once in a while its ok. I guess if you're not Iranian or Afghan you wouldn't be able to tell the difference. Their food is quite mediocre, made with mediocre ingredients. It's not the real Persian/Iranian experience at all. They need to up their game. But all in all its ok. Much better than the kabab grill down the street."}
{"text":"I am pretty easy to please when dining out, but this is a restaurant I would not return to. We were the only patrons in the restaurant. The staff was not friendly or welcoming. We had water to drink, but it tasted like chemicals were just added. I had the lamb kebab. It was over cooked and did not taste like lamb. Sorry to say I don't think it will be around for the long haul.

Quick update. The owner contacted me regarding these issues. He is working on fixing these problems.  Nice to know that owners stay on top of Yelp reviews!"}
{"text":"The food was okay but our entire experience wasn't great. We most likely won't be going back especially when there's a restaurant similar down the street."}
{"text":"Mohammad is a great and friendly staff at the best Kabob place in Vegas. The food is always great and i've never had any complaints. Ive been coming here since they opened and have been pleased with the delicious food. its always served great and always tastes great! The one on sunset is not as fresh when it comes to the meat as this place. Sometimes the meat their is chewy but this location makes it prefect!"}
{"text":"This is one of the better places in Henderson. I make it a point to eat here each trip. Their food is extremely flavorful and well prepared. The portion size is plentiful and many options are available. One of the  down sides is sometimes communication can be difficult over the phone. I perceive this to be a language barrier between the staff and myself. None the less they are friendly and accommodating but if I'm in a hurry it can be problematic. Placing an order is much easier at the actual location. The vegetable side sometimes has a different seasoning(none) or wonderfully spiced. It is hit or miss. Overall it is worthy of 4 stars and has several healthy options for those counting carbs or calories."}
{"text":"Staff is not very friendly and portions felt smaller compared to the Sunset location. 

What we got was still very very tasty and we will deal with the not-so-great service again sometime."}
{"text":"well, try it and here is my review of this place...... we had a ground beef kubideh kabob and tenderloin lamb shish kabob.. both came with fresh made taftoon bread which is absolutely wonderful, fresh onion and grilled tomatoes, mixed green arugula salad with lemon, and saffron rice.. drizzle lemon over your greens was great idea from my daughter, and it was very refreshining, I loved saffron rice, cooked just perfect, everything is fresh, the only down part is the lamb shish kabob is cooked a lil too dry, and i think if the place is named kabob, then the kabob itself should not fail, all and all i liked this place but mayb ill skip the lamb next time."}
{"text":"The number 14 is the best. As the salads and kabobs are awesome as well. This food is very fresh and very easy for me to digest . I have crohns disease and the food has everytime been easy on my stomach. The hand made bread is my family favorite. Thank you"}
{"text":"Ordered takeout food from kebab Oasis the other night. Fantastic food, great menu and excellent delivery experience through Uber eats. The chicken and lamb kebabs were perfectly cooked, and the rice was excellent. The Middle Eastern bread that came with it was a nice surprise. Healthy portions, and very fresh and clean cooked ingredients. Highly recommend them."}
{"text":"Surprisingly good!  Very well seasoned, flavor, tender and juicy. The choices for side orders are really great and lots of varieties. Will recommend to family and friends. Reminded my husband and us when we lived in Cyprus Island, Greece. Only recommendation I have is get more servers. It was very crowded and they were working very hard. Great service though."}
{"text":"Sorry. Food was just not good. It may be due to it being a Saturday and the place was totally empty. Hard for me to make a return with so many other great places in the neighborhood. 

Staff was very friendly.

We had the steak kabobs"}
{"text":"Sometimes we are going there for dinner.Everything was delicious. Thanks for delicious kabobs!We will visit soon again.Good place for lunch and dinner!"}
{"text":"New place with kinks still be worked out (no ice tea) but the gyro salad portion was pretty good. Not happy they didn't have the garlic sauce ready just yet. Has some potential to be good neighborhood spot nice and clean"}
{"text":"2* for food , +1* for having Mashti Malone's ice cream.

I've come here twice, and it's not my pick for kebab in the area - may only come here in the future when I'm jonesing for some Mashti Malone's. What's odd about this place is that the rice is just plain bland rice, and side salads are served dry. Really brings down the value proposition. The hummus was fine though, and the pita was freshly baked. As far as meats, my lamb shish and kubideh were just OK. Took a bite of my friend's grilled salmon and thought that was pretty good. But every chicken dish I've tried here was super dry, so I'd avoid it."}
{"text":"The food is fresh & fast. Love that it's grilled & an alternative option to fast food joints without being a full on restaurant. If I'm out running errands this is my go to stop. Everyone has always been super friendly & the portion size is great. Food is consistently good & seasoned perfectly. The kabobs are a regular favorite. The chicken Karachi even prepared mild has a great kick to it & the flavor is unreal! I've never had a bad experience here. The hummus is a perfectly yummy treat if you're not particularly hungry, stop in for cold ice-tea & an order of hummus!"}
{"text":"Update: adding more stars as the Owner was quick to reply and is trying to make the situation better. Love the airport location. Hope he's able to recreate

Very disappointed. Have been going to the airport location for a couple of years and have given this Henderson location a few chances. That will stop tonight. I ordered my food for pickup. The order was ready but the girl at the front counter didn't say hello, didn't acknowledge me and looked upset at the world. It was t till the other worker smiled at me and I said good night that she managed to say anything. I was quick to tell her my hello wasn't for her and the least she could do is verify the customer is the right one picking up. 

If it was just rude service I could live but the food was HORRIBLE. I ended up throwing it away. My gyro didn't even have gyro meat. It looked like they chopped up an old kebab. It was doused with lemon juice and it tasted like leather. The chicken kubideh tasted horrible as did the beef. We had wilted lettuce in everything and the fries were limp. My food overall was cold. No wonder the place is always dead. Bad service and bad food. Not rocket science to see why no one is coming"}
{"text":"Terrible.  The place is always empty for a reason.  Employees are rather rude.  Their kabob chicken was dry and tough.  Their gyro meat tasted a little gamey.  With only my family and another customer their tables were still dirty. The only good thing there was the cold green hot sauce which was excellent."}
{"text":"Very very disappointed! My shawarma chicken was not even close to a normal shawarma! It was big Huge chicken curry pieces in a half naan bread! Am so disappointed because they have the rolls for the actual shawarma but no real shawarma thin slides meats. Never go there! Mather fact the places was empty at lunch hours."}
{"text":"Ordered on UBER Eats. Preparation and delivery were quick. Pita bread is good, kabob tasty, and rice is good.

I'm disappointed though that this meal was very dry. I just realized how much Tzatziki sauce made a difference when eating this type of food. It would have been nice to receive that and/or hummus complimentary. Don't even see it as an option on the menu for ordering on UBER eats. The notes for notes say \"ask for extra sauce\"... 

My salads-- which I got two of-- one of mixed greens and the other of straight water lettuce-- didn't even have salad dressing! I don't need two types of green. If you're going to give me green, give me tabbouleh.. babaganoush.. something!

WAAAAH. I feel like I'm eating sand. Good sand at that... but sand nonetheless.

p.s. I had to use my grilled tomato to moisturize my meal."}
{"text":"Had a coupon and decided to give this place a try. Still pricey, even using the coupon for what we got. Place was empty at dinner time on a Wed evening on Eastern Ave.....will not last long. Counter girl was not welcoming or friendly in the transaction. Snapped at me when I thought the order up was mine. She had her two toddlers in a booth while she worked. 
We got 2 gyros and 2 chicken shish kabob to go. Not impressed with either. Gyro had no onions, one had a sliver of a tomato. Sauce was like plain yogurt. And it was stuffed with shredded lettuce. I don't think I have ever had shredded lettuce on a gyro. Bread was chewy like when you microwave it. Meat was a bit salty and they did not have a pit cooking it, instead took it out of the fridge and reheated it. Fries didn't seem like they were made fresh, kind of cold and chewy again.
Chicken came with bland rice, and more chewy bread. Some lettuce on side, no sauce, no hummus. Chicken itself was okay, had some flavor.
Nothing appeared to be made fresh as they advertise. Everything was warmed up, which doesn't always make for quality taste. There are other Mediterranean food places close to this location and for the freshness and price,we will chose the other options next time."}
{"text":"Delicious halal food! Nice selection of items, including halal burgers and chicken tenders. Food is cooked fresh and the bread made to order is yummy! Prices are great for the portions and service is friendly and welcoming."}
{"text":"OMG. If they serve beer or wine I'd give them five stars.food was excellent, service was so so but food made us very satisfied."}
{"text":"Awesome persian food on Eastern Ave.  All food is prepared fresh, and it's the perfect take out spot for persian.  Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"First time there last night.  We had a coupon and was still pricey, so it won't be our everyday place to eat, but when we want excellent middle east food, of the kabob variety, this will definitely be on the list.  The portions were very generous, the rice was well prepared and the meats were very good.  The marinade they use on the chicken was unlike any we've had anywhere.  Very savory.  I had a plate with chicken pieces and ground chicken skewers.  Both were great.  My wife had the beef and was also excellent.  The salad was very large.  So much we had to take most home.  Wish they used kalamata olives instead of plain old sliced black salad olives.  The bread they serve is as good as I've had at any middle east restaurant I've eaten. Their side dish menu looked good, except they need mujadrah, pickled turnips and a pickled mixed vegetables to round out the sides.  Otherwise, I highly recommend this place to anyone who is looking for pretty authentic Persian food.  Wish the prices were a bit lower though."}
{"text":"OMG the food here is so good. I don't know much about Mediterranean food so I can't even say much about how it compares to other spots except that this is probably my favorite place to get kabobs out of like the 10 kabob restaurants I've ever tried in life, but it is far better than all the others.

I love how fresh it is. The kabobs are cooked over fire so it has that nice flavor to it. The saffron rice is not dry and has a good mild flavor to it that compliments everything else. And then there's this sauce that it all comes with. I don't know if it's meant to be salad dressing or what, but it is great to dip your meat or naan in!! You have to try it.  I also tried the meat dumplings or whatever it is and to my utter surprise, it was SO delicious! The name was kind of weird but I got it because I had ordered eggplant and they ran out so they recommended to try that instead, which I am so glad they did!

That leads me to my next point... They are super respectful here. There might be a little bit of a language barrier but they are very courteous, very friendly if you ask questions, and if you're eating there, they'll actually check up on you to make sure everything is going well even though this is more of a fast food restaurant rather than a sit down with a sever kind of place. I love it!"}
{"text":"Items Selected:
Hummus and Baba Ghanoush, Simple Salad, Fresh Taftoon Bread
Chicken and Lamb Kabob, Grilled Tomato, Saffron Rice, Simple Salad, Fresh Taftoon Bread
Falafel Wrap on Fresh Taftoon Bread, Spicy Yogurt, Simple Salad 
Baklava

Featuring two locations in the Southeast, Fresh Kabob near McCarran and Kabob Oasis on South Eastern Avenue close to St. Rose Parkway, it was with previous lunch plans on Saturday abandoned that a stop was made at the latter, the results falling somewhat shy of greatness alleged by a colleague even though the food was seemingly authentic, affordable and fresh.

Originally opened in 2012 with location #2 arriving late-Spring 2015, a replacement for former tenant Shawarma Plus apparently a franchised outpost of the Airport location serving a similar menu, it was around 11:30am that the corner-space of a strip-mall was entered, no other diners present but a petite woman quickly emerging from the back room to take orders.

Laid out as a lengthy counter next to a sizable seating area, orders placed prior to payment and diners subsequently invited to sit and wait while listening to genre-appropriate music accompanied by video from a lone TV, it was a few minutes after seating that a thin man emerged from a small office to begin cooking, two skewers quickly plucked from a refrigerator and placed over the grill while he spent several minutes rolling, cutting and baking fresh Persian Bread. 

Serving only Halal Meats and eschewing all preservatives, unnatural colorings and fillers, the promise that everything served is never frozen or microwaved proudly promoted both online and in the menu, it was while watching the man fill the clay oven that a first plate of two dips was delivered, a few leaves of greenery stacked in front of lightly charred Taftoon with a distinct tanginess to the fluffy crumb that plays well off smoky pureed Eggplant, though a bit less well with Hummus that would benefit from a bit more seasoning and less Oil.

Not quite finished with the Hummus and Babaganoush as a second patron entered the space, a $16.99 Kabob combination arriving just as the nearby hospital's employee placed his order, those looking for a good \"deal\" will potentially find the plate appealing as it offers more than a half-pound of Meat in addition to just as much Rice, though the fact that Chicken was grilled to the point of dry while Saffron was imperceptible amongst the grains significantly restricted the enjoyment of everything save for cubes of Lamb that shined beneath a spicy Marinade.

Taking a Vegetarian Wrap to go, the contents questionably as \"fresh\" as Kabob Oasis would suggest since the Falafel was not fried-to-order and came crumbled amidst spicy Sauce and Vegetables, it was setting aside the majority that attention turned to a $1.99 Baklava slice, the layers of pastry not Honey-soaked but at the same time not crisp which makes one question not just whether it is made on-site, but when as well.

**1/2: Comparatively priced to Parsley Mediterranean and Sababa, but only improving on those by way of the freshly baked Bread while falling short otherwise, those considering Kabob Oasis would do well to pick and choose wisely or simply move on to another Mediterranean Restaurant in a city that has plenty."}
{"text":"Delicious! We had the chicken karahi and lamb shish kabob. Both were really good! Staff was friendly. Only downside is food took some time to cook but it was well worth the wait! Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"This location is the second opening in town and is brand new. Quiet and not a lot of other customers, but clean. Pretty decently priced and staff is nice. Hummus is really great and pita bread was made fresh. My boyfriend likes his food as well, but rice didn't have much flavor. We will be definitely returning and I would recommend this place to try out!"}
{"text":"Pros:  Affordable prices. Coupons available in the 89074 magazine and restaurant.com. Fresh made Persian flat bread.

Cons:  Gyro sandwiches and Baklava are dissapointing. Maybe they should stick with Persian food.

Found this place in the 89074 magazine and thought we would give it a try. I was excited that they had a Gyro meal for a fair price; $6.99 on their Yelp menu.  When I got to the restaurant I was even more excited to see that they had the same Gyro and fries meal for $5.99 on special.  Their Baklava was also fairly priced for $1.99.  Henderson is full of overpriced Kabob and Greek restaurants, so I was very happy with their prices.

The food was made to order, which is always awesome but the flavors were dissapointing. The fresh bread was good, but the meat was dry and bland. The sauce was sour and overpowering.  Maybe they should stick with Kabobs and not try to make Gyros.

The Baklava was equally dissapointing. We won't be back, but I wish them the best."}
{"text":"Average service and the food is mostly bland. I had the steak kabob, lamb kubideh and a side of hummus. The kabob was bland, however if you add enough of the green sauce they provide, it's not too bad. The hummus was flavourless, it consisted of unseasoned mashed up Chickpeas. The bread that comes with the dish was also quite bland. The standout was the kubideh which was quite tasty and well seasoned."}
{"text":"I stopped by Kabob Oasis to pick up lunch after driving past it and thinking \"Man, I'd really love a kabob!\" The location isn't exactly ideal - the plaza's parking situation is annoying at best, and Kabob Oasis is right at one of the exits of the plaza out onto Eastern. It's just not a great spot for easy parking. 

So anyway, restaurant itself! I walked in and the first thing I noticed was how hot it was inside. It wasn't cold outside, there was no reason to walk into a restaurant and have it be that hot. It was unbearably hot. Like I ordered at the counter, sat down, and didn't move until my food was ready and I still managed to get sweaty. Yucky. I can't imagine eating in there with the temperature that high. The décor is basic, literally nothing special. Brightly colored walls, a TV hanging on the wall, and a bunch of tables.  

The gentleman who helped me was very friendly. I told him I'd never been there before and that I like lamb, and he made recommendations. I ended up getting a lamb kabob platter and a side of hummus. The platter came with a single lamb kabob on a bed of rice, a small salad (it was really just some lettuce), and some bread. The hummus also came with bread. It wasn't like pita bread, but it was really delicious. The lamb was delicious! It was seasoned well and tender. The rice was a little on the greasy side (or maybe that was just grease from lamb that dribbled down) and could have used some more seasoning, but it's rice. The hummus was really good, especially with the bread to dip in it! They have fountain drinks as well as bottled drinks, but I skipped on both. 

Overall, the food was delicious. The gentleman I spoke with was very friendly and helpful. I can't imagine wanting to dine in at this place though. If & when I return, it will be to get a to-go order again. That's just how unbearable the heat was!!"}
{"text":"We got some coupons in those local zip codes books and so we finally decided to give it a try.  This is a Persian restaurant serving halal meat and I could see why the prices are a little higher compared to the neighboring Greek restaurants.  I understand there is a slight difference, also in flavor but it's Mediterranean food that I can compare it with.

First thing we noticed were the meat in these large skewers and finally understood the portion sizes are larger.  This is a casual restaurant and the average plate runs about $16. The gyro plate came with fries and a bit of mixed leafy greens was only $7.  Prices are slightly higher, as you get what you pay for here.  

Here's my take on it all.  Large portions, the gyro too salty for it's own good as it's my favorite dish to order and the skewers had underwhelming flavor.  So, the big difference between Greek and Persian in terms of bread is freshly made, lighly charred tandoori bread versus packaged pita bread.  Here's my 3 star merit, the meat has to be awesome even if the bread is outstanding.  

Definitely worth a stop, but I'm still leaning towards Stephano's and Kebob Grill."}
