{"text":"Pros: - Very cool vibe - Great coffee and beer - Live music Wed, Fri eve and Sat noon - Beards  Cons: - Makes other places look bad"}
{"text":"Friendly staff, comfortable fun place. Everyone was nice to my kids, shady outdoor seating with misters appreciated by my dog. Fun live music Saturday afternoon. WiFi. Coffee and beer. Support this great local place!"}
{"text":"This was the worst restaurant experience I've had in a long time.  I looked the breakfast menu up online it looked limited but when we got there half the items online weren't even on the menu. I got an egg sandwich and a cappuccino. The coffee was awful! Tasted chalky and the sandwich was ok. With a Starbucks right across the street they should step up their coffee. Worst of all the staff was not welcoming or friendly at all. This was our first time and most certainly our last."}
{"text":"Sip Coffee & Beer House is awesome. Good vibes, coffee, food, booze - all of it one place that has a variety of furniture to choose from and a patio for sitting outside in the nice weather. The staff is friendly and helpful. Regarding what they sell, I'm a fan of the Kevlar coffee and the bacon breakfast burrito. I recommend this place to anyone who is looking for a chill, unique spot."}
{"text":"Got an almond milk cappuccino and latte. Both were good. The cappuccino is \"American style,\" meaning it has a bit less foam (and more milk or water). With almond milk, less foam is better, in my opinion.   Had trouble finding gourmet coffee in AZ when I visited. This place hit the spot."}
{"text":"One of my new favorite spots. Good service, good beer (Dragoon IPA-yum), good coffee and goodish food. All the girls who work there are always nice and helpful. Cute atmosphere and the bathroom wall says, no one grabs my pussy, so that's a plus too. 5/5. Wish there was a Sip in Tempe."}
{"text":"Mediocre food, typical cash register service.  I don't know who wrote such glowing reviews for Sip, but the experience was nothing like the reviews.  It's a self serve place with a silent cash register person who makes you feel like you're ordering at a fast food place.  It was Sunday at 12:20, and the singer/guitarist was so loud, it was impossible to get far enough away from speakers to be able to converse with your friends.  Possibly a good place to go if you're alone and want to stay that way, but terrible if you have guests.  Never going back."}
{"text":"I think Colin is talking about me......that makes me sad but I don't work here.  I'm always by the register being \"faux\" busy though and always have to use my phone. Guess I should quit being so \"faux\" busy and just go sit at coffee shops everyday to watch people that have jobs then get online and make fun of them.   Seems like colon sorry Colin stupid spellcheck isn't thrilled with his life as discovered by looking at the rest of his one star reviews for just about every restaurant he's visited in his boring life. Maybe you should just stay home and eat your moms chicken and peaches????  This place rocks and so do the people. If it didn't it wouldn't be here anymore."}
{"text":"Nice little neighborhood coffee shop with live music, great outdoor DOG FRIENDLY patio, cool decor, and delicious coffee."}
{"text":"Wi-Fi does not work a majority of the time leaving you to go across the street to Starbucks."}
{"text":"What a cute place! I had a couple hours to kill and didn't want to go to a \"chain\" coffee place so found this jewel...great funky retro mid century eclectic vibe and coffee great! I had a nonfat latte and a bear-claw, oops guess workout later! Lots of fun chairs and couches to hang out and tables if you're working, not to mention shaded patio."}
{"text":"Great new place in Old Town.  We have been waiting for a coffee shop like this.  Highly recommend."}
{"text":"This place is awesome!   I could not wait until something like opened. Location is perfect and very easy to find. The owners and staff are great...very friendly and passionate about what they do!  I ordered the vanilla latter which was amazing, can't wait to go back. Highly recommend this place to anyone is who is looking for a great hangout any time of the day."}
{"text":"Their French press (Chemex) is great Pretzels are awesome, although I wished they had cheddar cheese sauce instead of white cheese, but prolly it's just my preference. Dollar tamales n beer on Wednesdays, plus live show wohoo!"}
{"text":"Great little neighborhood place.  We went on a Sunday and the live music was wonderful.  Food is good and drinks where awesome!  The bartenders where outgoing and gave excellent customer service. They were very engaging and pleasant.   The only draw back for us was finding a table was very difficult.  We noticed many tables that had 1 person utilizing a large table camped out, laptop open and earbuds in, which was not cool when trying to find a spot to sit a party of four.  Also, why would you have your earbuds in when there is live music? Rude to the performer.  I will go back again as the atmosphere, food and staff were excellent!  The only reason why it did not get the 5 stars was the seating."}
{"text":"Good ice coffee! They were blasting 1D which made me want to drill a hole in my head. I'll definitely be back to try out their beer selection!"}
{"text":"What a fun place!  The coffee is tasty, not too strong, and the outdoor seating is glorious. The staff is very friendly and always ready with a recommendation. Try it out!"}
{"text":"The owners Travis and Tida and the rest of their staff have done such an amazing job on this place. I was just looking for a cool and chill place with a patio that served some craft beers but this place offers so much more. The feeling, the atmosphere, the music, the friendliness of everyone (staff and patrons) makes this place a home away from home. I just can't wait till the back patio/common area opens soon! Keep up the great work and keep those awesome drinks and craft beers coming. Wish I was a coffee drinker because I have no doubt that is amazing as well."}
{"text":"I really love cafes that allow for a good study environment. There are many cafes that are starting to put locks over their wall sockets so that you can't recharge your laptop. This place is amazing. The baristas are inviting and the decor is awesome. I got the breakfast burrito (which was amazing) and the cold brew. The cold brew was good, but it didn't have a strong bite. Might have just been the specific type of bean they used. Either way, this place is awesome. I didn't get chance to try and of the beer but the prices and selection looked good. I would totally come back in the future."}
{"text":"Atmosphere is pretty nice (a mix between hipster loft and Scottsdale club). Beer selection is decent (better than the average restaurant). Food, however, was very disappointing. I am just glad we were there during happy hour and only paid $7 for our clearly frozen (digiorno) pizza."}
{"text":"Drove around looking for a great coffee shop and Sip is awesome. Hip atmosphere and great service. Enjoyed the breakfast bagel, chocolate croissant and coffee."}
{"text":"I had ice coffee paid three fifty! then asked for refill the guy said it's brewed for 24 hours and can't do it! He said it's a special way to make coffee and he has to charge me another three fifty! Glad Starbucks only charges $.50 cents"}
{"text":"This place is adorable! The decor is a lil hipster and rustic.  It is a quiet place with a great internet connection so if you're looking for a place to get work done, this is it. The staff is wonderful and genuinely nice, not fake nice like Starbucks and other major chains. PLUS, they serve alcohol so after you're done working you can move straight into play"}
{"text":"I stopped in for a quick coffee and pastry before an appointment. Sip Coffee & Beer House Nailed it! Thank you!"}
{"text":"Cute place! I've liked everything I've tried here as far as drinks go. I always get the cold brew  which is very refreshing. They could use a little more lighting in the evening because it gets pretty dark, but overall I love the atmosphere. It's one of the few Scottsdale coffee places that is open late, which is awesome for late night studying! I will keep coming back because of the good drinks, cute location, and the hours. Seriously, it's so nice to go somewhere to study and not have to leave at 9!"}
{"text":"Visited on opening day with some coworkers and found it better than some of the other coffee shops in the area.  Awesome patio and all the reclaimed wood is pretty legit.  Prices seem to be what you'd expect in Old Town."}
{"text":"This place is so amazing! Every piece of furniture is made by hand by the owner. The staff is amazing! You can even draw on a chalk board in the bathroom. Live music, great local brews, great coffee, great vibes."}
{"text":"Sip is the coffee/bar every person wishes they have. You blink and you're part of the family and you don't want to go anywhere else.  The bar is really strong for being a coffee bar. The drinks are everything you would want and expect from a locally focused establishment.  The coffee is great too! While I'm not the biggest coffee fiend, I don't feel guilty getting some caffeine here.  The most important part of this whole operation is the staff. They treat you like family first and make you a friend afterwards. Definitely a place I'll frequent while I live in Arizona. Top 5 places for me."}
{"text":"Stellar coffee, staff & live music. What more could you want from a local hangout?"}
{"text":"Sip is the kind of place you can bring your laptop and book and be there literally all day.  Cool vibe, cool music, coffee, food, beer, free wifi, dog friendly patio...what else do you need in life?  It is decorated with used retro furniture that makes me feel more comfortable than my own home.  It's on the pricey side and no discounted coffee refills = my ONLY complaint.  Love this place."}
{"text":"Sip is seriously the best local hang out. They have live music every Thursday night. It's never too crowded even on the weekends. There aren't sickeningly hip kids crawling around everywhere. The decor is very homey and their mixed adult beverages are delicious. Try the Jamaican Me Tipsy. You won't be sorry."}
{"text":"REALLY like this place! To me a good coffee joint has to have a relaxing vibe where you can feel comfortable just hanging out - - this place totally fits that description!  The coffee is really good (even though they can use bigger mugs) and the breakfast sandwich was killer!! It might be a little pricey but it is in downtown Scottsdale afterall.   I can't wait for warmer weather so I can hang on the patio."}
{"text":"Great, casual place for coffee on a Sunday morning.  I felt right at home as soon as I walked in the door.  Unpretentious, \"real\" and you certainly don't need to try to impress anyone here.  I'll be back for some brew on Saturday night and will follow that up with Sunday morning coffee (which is terrific, btw)."}
{"text":"Went here for the first time yesterday it was a cool little spot very interesting blend coffee and beer but it works it was clean and the service was good I will be back"}
{"text":"This place truly rocks, unpretentious and cool all at once - an anomaly in the otherwise obnoxious Scottsdale area. Great spot to grab a coffee/beer and do some work or chat with friends. If you're hungry look elsewhere but for hankerings of the caffeinated or alcoholic variety look no further."}
{"text":"Honestly, I know they use Cartels roast. But I truly believe Sip's baristas make better use of Cartels unique roast, than the Cartel baristas do. By this I mean, the coffee tastes better here, it still has that Cartel flavor, but it's less bitter and more fruity. I think they put more time/effort into pouring a proper coffee than Cartel does itself. Relaxing environment, free wifi, unique, comfortable and great coffee."}
{"text":"Absolutely love this place!  The overall vibe was perfect.  The staff was extremely friendly and helpful!  They talk to you like you've been friends forever - and I love that!  I'm looking forward to going back!  :)"}
{"text":"I love this place. They have a very friendly and helpful staff and their coffee and beer are equally wonderful!   I played at their Wednesday night \"open stage\" and I was pleasantly surprised. The scene was very relaxed, inviting, and friendly. I will be back next Wednesday!"}
{"text":"There are not to many places around (let alone in old town Scottsdale) where you can get such a cool vibe, have great craft beer and coffee and the service is the best part of the whole experience!!!!!"}
{"text":"Fun beer selection and not crowded. This place feels like it should be in central Phoenix, which I love!"}
{"text":"Love this place! Sip has amazing coffee drinks & nice selection of craft beers.     Hip, laidback atmosphere, cool music, dog friendly patio,  nice & friendly staff.    Especially, LOVE the bagel & egg sandwich.  ?  Please restock your pastries.....on Saturday mornings... at 10:00am.  And, please, CLEAN the restrooms!!!  Otherwise, SIP is my favorite place to visit!!!   I"}
{"text":"It is rare to get good coffee without feeling out of place amongst a sea of snobby hipsters. Sip has achieved this! Everyone working here is unbelievably cool and kind and did I mention how great the coffee is? Not to mention a great selection of beers. They have the best atmosphere for either a cool coffee shop to get some work done, or beers with friends. Go, you won't regret it."}
{"text":"Awsome place, hip and unique! Absolutely recommend it. Menu is great, the ambiance is unbeatable, I don't drink beer but my friends that had beer loved the selection and great taste."}
{"text":"Amazing coffee, great local beer selection.  My husband and I are in town from Seattle and consider ourselves seasoned coffee drinkers who had a hard time finding good coffee in Scottsdale. Every cup was over sweetened or watered down. NOT the case at Sip.  We visited late morning otherwise we would have tried some beers- but the selection looked great if you appreciate carefully crafted, delicious brews.  If you want amazing coffee, delicious beers and a really cool vibe do yourself a favor and go to sip!!! You will not be sorry. -Seattlites in Scottsdale"}
{"text":"Had morning coffee here a few times while in town for Spring Training. Nice staff, good coffee enjoyed the outdoor area. Strong effort all around."}
{"text":"LOVE THIS PLACE! I'm here almost everyday and the food and coffee is great. I've been to almost every coffee shop in a 5 mile radius and this is definitely my favorite. Stress-free atmosphere and lots of natural light and space."}
{"text":"The coffee situation: Sip use Cartel brand coffee and have on more than one occasion served it at luke-warm temperature. An easy fix, but still not the best sign that the simplest aspect of catering to the core customer base is neglected as an afterthought. I was informed the coffee is made once a day - in the morning. Perhaps Sip should just stick with their impressive beer selection on draft and skip the 'coffee thing' altogether? The look: The vintage decor is comfy/cool. I do love the outdoor seating and the ambient lighting is just right. The food: I had a sandwich. It was two slices of grocery-store bread with a few fixings. Not too impressed. The hummus was better. In general: This is the kind of coffee shop Scottsdale has been in desperate need for far too long. Other cities (San Francisco, Portland) have established destinations like this, so its a huge deal somebody finally trying to get it right. The service is pretty good, depending on who you get. The owner (guy with beard)  is a bid snide, truth be told. Not sure he comes from a customer service background, but there are books on the subject as well as some excellent YouTube videos! . Everyone else was engaging and friendly."}
{"text":"Such an amazing environment.  They open windows and doors to let the fresh air in.  Excellent latte, friendly service.  My favorite coffee house in Scottsdale!"}
{"text":"Sip Coffee & Beer House is truly a hidden gem at the edge of Old Town, and such a relaxing escape! The acoustics inside are fantastic; you can vibe to the varied selection of music they play overhead, while still being able to hold a conversation with the people around you. The decorations are eclectic, and much of the furniture appears to be from the 70s, but it holds up the atmosphere as a comfortable zone to gather with friends. The coffee is fresh and delicious and they have an incredible selection of beers and wines on tap! The baristas are incredibly nice and social as well. I can't emphasis enough how great of a spot this place is, and would recommend it over even Cartel as a place to grab a caffeinated or alcoholic beverage and chill out!"}
{"text":"I was a little hesitant going to a coffee shop in Scottsdale, but was surprised by the friendly staff.   First off, the parking situation is less than ideal. There were hardly any customers inside and still no parking available. I arrived on a Monday morning to get homework done, and luckily there were quite a few tables and free wifi. There's plenty of patio seating, and the decor is colorful and eclectic in the best way.   I ordered a cold brew which was a tad more acidic than I'd have preferred. No worries. Next time I'll spring for a latte because I'm definitely coming back. A friend and I shared a breakfast sandwich and it seriously hit the spot- like a fancier deli style bagel sandwich. We paid $6 for it so the prices weren't too steep.  I will definitely come back to grab a latte, maybe a beer (their selection was really impressive).  Overall: Iffy parking, great decor, friendly service, good food."}
{"text":"I love this place. Unique vibe to Scottsdale. Selection of coffee and beer is admirable. Groovy staff. Fun game night and open mic appearances are worth a watch. Go here if you are cool or cool ironically."}
{"text":"We loved the idea of Sip because we heard through a mutual contractor that it was owned by a couple. Being a couple opening a business in the same zip code, we were sure to try them out. We have been a few times in the morning and really enjoyed their classic lattes and bulletproof coffees. We also ordered their breakfast burrito and enjoyed them until we were told by the cashier that they were from a Mexican restaurant around the corner where we could have purchased them for half the price. Either way we enjoyed the morning atmosphere and looked forward to visiting for a beer flight in the evening. After a year of morning patronage, we finally made it this evening to sample their happy hour. First of all, they should have called it study hour, because, while it was packed, you could have heard a pin drop. Not exactly the atmosphere we were hoping for when sneaking out to a happy hour on the weekend! Worst of all, we took our one year old. We sat outside on the patio, and his occasional coos and aahs were such a juxtaposition to the volume in the room that we were rushing to finish our food and drinks and leave. Speaking of food and drinks, who serves tortilla chips with hummus? The hummus was tasty but nothing to brag about. The pretzel was hard and tough and the cheese it was accompanied by was gelatinous. We felt foolish ordering the pretzel because immediately next door was Brat Haus which serves the most delicious pretzels! Our Whiskey Mules also left something to be desired....and that was the whiskey. It tasted more like ginger ale. Overall, we were just looking for a good atmosphere and were left wanting. But we will be back to try out trivia night(hoping for an upbeat crowd), definitely for a classic latte in the morning, and are are anxious to try their new location.   Lesson Learned: Sunday Evening at Sip, make sure to bring your study books and laptop or you will be out of place and just...plain...bored..."}
{"text":"Really good coffee, but on my second visit they were out of almost everything on the food menu - at 8:30 in the morning. And the trash can where you bus your table was covered with disgusting crud."}
{"text":"Why go to starbucks when you can get real coffee here?!?! My cappucino was de-lish, along with the breakfast burrito! They baristas were super nice and fast. Lots of space to sit... It makes me want to come back later for a drink from the bar :)"}
{"text":"Just found this new jewell in old town. The creativity and style make this the newest and coolest spot for a cup! Must see, owners style is so unique!"}
{"text":"I went here today with my husband for a late breakfast. I've been it pop over but never had the time to go and today was the perfect day for that. There is a small parking lot, but not many spaces. With the other restaurants popping up right next to it, I can see that parking will be an issue in the future, if it's not already.  I loved the decor. They did a great job with creating different areas to sit and different type of sitting and interactions. The outside is nice. Although it's very 'hipster', it's super clean. I LOVE that. One thing I don't like about Cartel is that everything is hardly staying together. It's very dirty there. But Sip is great. They have a nice beer selection and coffee too.   We had a breakfast sandwich, breakfast burrito, iced coffee, and a cinnamon swirl cake. The cake was AMAZING. May need to stop by during lunch to get it again... or every day =]  The burrito was good and although unusual to add sausage, it was nice. I liked that they gave you tomatillo salsa (could be tangier) and sour cream. Tomatillo salsa doesn't get enough credit.   I would give them a 5 if they didn't have cartel. I find their beans to be sour and not the freshest.   Will definitely be going back here again for group nights and lunch during work. I would also like to go during the nights they have open mic and music events. That's one thing I miss from Tucson- coffee shops were a place to meet new people and learn something new. Kudos, Sip!  Their kiosk is also cool. Looking into doing the same thing for my business.  I had planned to take a photo of the cake but it was gone before I could snap a photo! SO GOOD."}
{"text":"I have such a love hate relationship with this place. I love the super chill vibe; low key, relaxed and eclectic, but this service is subpar, to say the least. They somehow struggle to find friendly staff that have good customer service skills. I always have to ask for happy hour pricing because they don't offer it up until you ask, and even then, they never seem to ring it in. They also don't list the prices for beer so you can easily pay $9 for less than a pint of beer, plus tip. As much as I may complain, I'll continue to go back for the cool venue space and the relaxed environment. Bring a book, laptop and/or some friends and enjoy the reggae music."}
{"text":"Can't believe I've never reviewed this place before -- it's my go-to work/pretend to work while people watching on their first date/meet from online dating sort of spot.  Staff are not particularly friendly (or unfriendly - don't get me wrong) but you won't get the corporate overly-cheerful vibe from most of the ladies who work here.  I swear the music they play is directly tapped into my iTunes (think alternative, reggae, beach-y sort of tunes).  Seating is a hodge-podge of brightly-colored folding chairs, plastic chairs, and your rescued grandmother's flowery armchair.  Mixed around are an adequate supply of outlets to charge up your devices.  Parking can get a bit tight (to say the least) but you can park along the side of the building - well, lots of people do, anyways, and I've never seen a tow truck spring into action.  I'm sad they don't do tamales anymore, but the food is surprisingly good - and reasonably priced as well!  Last, a testament to this place is that all the patrons are friendly, up for a brief chat if you REALLY need a work break, and happy to move their stuff or offer an outlet if they see you've been off-power for some time."}
{"text":"I will take a stand here.    If anyone should be so idiotic as to post negative here. It is safe come on down shortly thereafter, because they won't be back and you are going to be stoked that you have chosen so well. I may never give 5 stars again RL"}
{"text":"Was really disappointed in the service and quality of coffee I experienced during my last visit here.  The two workers at the counter seemed annoyed that they had to end their conversation and talk to a customer.  Not friendly at all.  I ordered an iced coffee, which I usually drink black, but this coffee was so terrible tasting, I went back to get a splash of almond milk, which did not take well to the coffee (it turned to chunks/too acidic?).  It just tasted horrible.  I took it back and asked for my money back and they couldn't have been more rude to me.  For a place that calls themselves a Coffee House, you should be able to order an iced coffee and drink it black. I will say I've gone here many times with friends and ordered either tea or beer and was satisfied all other times.  I was looking to have a quiet hour away reading and ended up leaving very disappointed.  The two workers didn't apologize and made me feel as if I should have drank the coffee as is.  I will not go back."}
{"text":"Cool atmosphere, nice patio. But I'm a little irritated at the sarcastic comments that accompany the suggested tip amounts on the iPad square payment screen and the little poster designating the tip bucket at the register. I gave 20%, which was $2 and some change... yet I'm not sure for what. I ordered a sandwich, came with a salad and a glass of water. They were out of My first menu choice, the bruschetta and out of bacon that should have been on my second choice.    The wait for food wasn't too bad, but no water and no fork. So, I go to the register to ask for \"missing items\" to learn it's serve yourself over here by the sugar packets and nutmeg.  so, what was the tip for, exactly???  As for the food, the lettuce (\"salad\") was drenched in olive oil only and the sandwich was average, at best. The boys behind the counter were really not even that friendly.   So, before you get up in arms at my knocks on their customer service, I spent years in the service Industry and still remember what it's like to actually earn a tip.... this was not it. Another reason why I don't believe in tipping prior to service. Shame on my guilt for allowing it to happen!!!"}
{"text":"Very cool place with an inviting menu ( tried the kale salad which was awesome) and a nice hot espresso. It was  about 75 degrees with a breeze, so our group of 12 sat outside on the patio. Great vibe, nice and relaxed. The staff is really good, very friendly and mellow. The manager greeted all of us and went down the beer list and options with an interested patron. Good music playing with speakers outside as well."}
{"text":"This is probably one of my favorite coffee/ beer spots of all time...at least when it's not summer :( the vibe is great, have open mic/live music often, and I just love the bagel breakfast sandwich. I'm just happy when I'm here."}
{"text":"Love the atmosphere here! I usually come to study and drink some of there coffee/tea. I was also surprised to see bulletproof coffee on their menu, and it was definitely good!!   I can sit at this coffee place for 6-7 hours studying and not even notice the time go by. It's well worth a visit whether you're studying, catching up with a friend, or going out on a date. Parking is a little tough if it's a crowded day, but across the street there is plenty of parking."}
{"text":"Sip is a quaint little coffee shop right at the tail end of Old Town Scottsdale's row. Last I ordered, I got an iced chai latte that was quite good, especially on a warm day! Enjoyed \"sipping\" my tea outside on their patio and enjoyed a nice breeze, while shootin' the breeze with my gal pal. My only critique is the decor, feels a bit too hodgepodge."}
{"text":"Great place been there a few times for a nightcap, but a great place for Sunday Breakfast.  A coffee, breakfast burrito and a beer in a funky relaxing atmosphere is the perfect way to start a Sunday."}
{"text":"Went here for the first time with the three of us! We saw a commercial on tv and were so excited! We drove from Ahwatukee, so it took us a while and we passed it a few times before finding it! It was crowded so we had to wait for a seat to open up! We got three coffees there and they were awfully strong (we like ours a little more sweet) and we each ordered some food. There food was awesome! The one thing I didn't like was how long it took for it to come out and than when it did my burrito took an extra 8ish minutes by itself. Other than that I'll remember this place if I'm ever in the area! Best of luck to the owners!"}
{"text":"I absolutely love living so close to this gem of a coffee and beer place! Two great things combined into a cool relaxed hangout with live music and free yoga on the weekends! Alex the manager is so friendly and always comes to say hello! We can bring our puppy to the patio where the wonderful staff always gives her lots of love! Their weekend mimosa bar is perfect and so delicious with FRESH juices and fruit. The coffee speaks for itself and the cocktails are too good. Morning or night, it's just a perfect spot to grab a beverage and some food. A real Old Town favorite for locals and visitors alike!"}
{"text":"I love sip.  Best local coffee hands down.  Travis, the owner, is extremely friendly, Alex is awesome though I am sad he is not at the Sdale location anymore,(miss you!) and Austin makes the best drinks and is really nice to look at;).  Also the drinks are on point and the music is good, which is crucial!  Right now it's Sunday and we are listening to old school underground hip hop!;) you can't beat that!!!!  The decor is amazing...  I love all the repurposed pieces and have stolen some ideas for my place already.  Fuck starfucks, walk across the street!!!!"}
{"text":"Coffee was awful !!  Tasted like it was there for days and the music is way too loud.  Should have gone to starbucks across the street."}
{"text":"Love this place! The staff is always friendly and they have great  beers on tap. Can't ask for much more! They serve cartel coffee and beer, btw! We had the bruschetta, but would loved to try more food, just had dinner afterwards planned. Definitely stop by this place!"}
{"text":"This place gets a solid and well-deserved five stars. I will admit: a friend of mine manages the place, but I came across it all on my own long before I knew him and loved it even then.  Sip Coffee & Beer House is everything you want in an establishment go its kind: super laid-back, good music set to a manageable volume, great coffee, outstanding craft beer selection, even live music some nights!  The staff is consistently wonderful in my experience (kudos Alex and Sip crew!). It's also open later most nights than other coffee shops in the surrounding area, making it a great place to camp out for a while, even late at night.  The ambiance is right up my alley: very quirky and hipster-ish without being over-the-top. The place just kinda feels like home. It also has plenty of outside seating which is PERFECT as the cooler months approach. I'm actually seated happily at the covered patio as I type this.  This is one of those FEW places you frequent. I probably have half a dozen decent coffee shops within walking distance of where I live, but I still drive over here because it's just that good. Set just apart from the craziness of Old Town Scottsdale, it's a perfect location, too.  I can't say enough good about Sip. If you haven't been, GO! If you have been, you already know what I'm talking about, don't you? I've been coming here for over a year, and I'll keep on coming back. For now, I've gotta go: the live band is starting back up again.  ;)"}
{"text":"Love this new place - good location and very relaxed and comfortable atmosphere.  Nice patio, good music and the coffee was excellent (expected because it's Cartel coffee!) served in \"real\" cups.  Will be back very soon to check out the beer selection.  A new hang out place for us I think."}
{"text":"Sip was a really sweet spot and I think I was able to try all aspects of it. I started with just getting an espresso and taking in the cool vibe of the place. It's got both indoor an outdoor seating although it was definitely too hot to be out there. They have table, bar, and couch seating.   The espresso was good but as the day went on I realized they offer flights of beer. So I decided to try three of them. When I was talking to the guy at the bar, though, he really didn't know much about them. So I just tried 3 random ones and wasn't disappointed.  After the beers, I felt like I needed some food, so I got one of Sip's homemade soft-pretzel. It was amazing. It comes with either mustard or cheese and the mustard was great. It was the perfect snack with either coffee or beer.  I can see how sip can easily transition from place to work into a place to drink. This is a great little local spot for either of your caffeine or alcohol fixes."}
{"text":"I was here for a Yoga event in the parking lot and I don't actually drink coffee, but I like the fact that they have a good selection of craft beer and the atmosphere inside was very appealing. Lots of seating, space to set up your lap top and work, and live music from a guitar playing singer. All in all, this is the type of place where I could see myself hanging out."}
{"text":"What a great place!  Thanks to my fellow Yelpers for recommending it.    I came in here during Happy Hour, which they have every day 4-7 PM, and was treated to not only excellent specials, but great beer and terrific sandwiches as well.  The service is great.  I love how they let you sample the beer before you order.  There was live music when I came in, which made the atmosphere even more relaxing.  This is a welcome addition to Old Town, and I can't wait to come back. Enjoy!"}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite coffee spots!! The drinks (beer and coffee) I've tried there are all great, customer service is amazing, it's got a very quaint, stylish, artsy ambiance. The live music they have perks your ear - they're good artists. They also serve great looking food (that I haven't tried yet..but I see what other people are eating..and it looks delicious!!). The customers are even friendly as I walk in the door. Love this spot!"}
{"text":"Ok, so I love their coffee drinks. They are so good that I can find no fault. Service is also really good. Sadly, I can only give them 3 stars because the food is not great. I've had a salad that was ok, & a breakfast burrito that was terrible. Mind you neither was cheap.   I paid $8 for an awful breakfast burrito. I'm not even sure how you mess up a breakfast burrito, but they do. I've had better $3 burritos. One of the best breakfast burritos I've had is from Giant Coffee downtown. It's too far to drive most of the time, so maybe Sip could call & get burrito help from Giant?  I love your coffee, please improve your food Sip. It's overpriced & not good."}
{"text":"Best dirty chai in town! Super mellow,comfy and great vibe. The small plates and pastries are top notch and my pup never wants to leave their dog friendly patio."}
{"text":"This place is pretty stellar, great ambiance all around. I'd recommend the kale salad and cold brew with almond milk. Fav place in Scottsdale whoooooooo!!!"}
{"text":"Love this Place!  Great Coffee - Cool Staff - Good Vibes All Around :)))  A Chill Place To Hang.. Xx"}
{"text":"Good place for late night cappuccino and to hang out. Patio out in the front. Entertaining to see a guy being \"booted out\" because it looked like he was over his drinking limit. Things that make you go hmmmm....;)"}
{"text":"I like the energy in this place ,I visited with  work prospect for their great coffee . It does remind of a great places we visited in San Diego while back . The only reason giving 4star , is because it is allowing pets inside which makes some people uncomfortable and annoying when you have some kind of meeting . Totally recommend it if someone wants to try some new places beside the regular coffee shop ."}
{"text":"Sip House is a great bar/coffee shop and I frequent it a few times a week. A great variety of beers and the Mac and cheese is AWESOME. Staff are always friendly and fun. Live music creates a very enjoyable environment."}
{"text":"Coffee and beer at the same place! I'm double fisting and I'm in heaven ! what more can you ask for? This place is awesome the menu is somewhat limited but it doesn't matter. The background music is very good and lots of outdoor & indoor seating plus free WiFi! My one smoker friend is complaining that he can't smoke in the outdoor seating but screw him we don't want to smell that anyways.  UPDATE: not as in love as I was.  Sweetener selection is lacking, no pink, blue, or yellow.  Prices are higher and portions are smaller."}
{"text":"Sampling some local coffee houses during a slow week. Not many local joints in South Scottsdale, but this one on the corner is very pleasant. The hazlenut latte I ordered was well presented and tasty and the back patio was pleasant enough with not alot of people clogging the seats after 9am. It was about 4 bucks for the latte and I even glimpsed a hummingbird. It almost reminded me a country meadow, until the DB with his daddy's BMW came cruising into the lot.  UPDATE: Cinnamon Coffee cake thingy was stale. AVOID at 4 bucks. Hummingbird Garden has been trimmed too."}
{"text":"Stopped by for a quick bite. Have never been here before and the first thing that captured my attention was the cleanliness of the establishment. I understand that this is a relatively new location, but I appreciate a clean facility. I ordered the wings, (full dozen). The wings were perfectly cooked. The sauces aren't just your ordinary traditional wing sauce. They call them by the same name ie, ranch, bbq, hot, etc. Sip puts a unique twist to the sauces. All of them were very tastey and flavorful. I would definitely come back again."}
{"text":"Food is awesome and it's a great atmosphere.  Breakfast burrito is like a panini and is delicious. Sunday music is a bonus."}
{"text":"Came in here on a whim and now it's going to be my new coffee spot. Walked in and Blind Pilot and Noah and the Whale was playing over the speakers so I already knew it was going o be a wonderful experience. I ordered an almond milk latte for here and it was wonderfully crafted with nice bold, earthy, just the right amount of sweet espresso. The customer service was incredible and their beer taps are plentiful! Highly recommended to anyone with good music taste and a pallet for amazihg coffee and equally adequate atmosphere."}
{"text":"Very cool laid back place with good beer and drinks, need to try food next time to upgrade to 5 stars"}
{"text":"We went to both locations. Both apparently had good coffee (I'm not the coffee drinker). One had gluten-free peanut butter cookies that were damn good. Nice ambiance, and there was live music by a guy with a band called Fayuca (Spotify-able apparently) who was quite good."}
{"text":"Great place to work unless it is a Saturday and loud, live music bothers you. Parking is sometimes limited, but around the block there is almost always street-parking.  Plenty of seating and lots of food/beverage items: coffee, beer, pastries, sandwiches. However, the service leaves something to be desired. They are regularly out of things or the kitchen is out of service (e.g. during my last visit they shut down the kitchen for 45 minutes in the middle of the day because \"there was a big mess\"). This has been a recurring theme. The cashiers are often sassy and ambivalent towards customers."}
{"text":"Oh Sip, why must you let me down so?  I went to this place four different times, trying beer and coffee and snacks. I'll try to keep this short:  Pros: -Cool aesthetic  -Cool concept  Cons: -Service. Consistently poor here. It's odd. There is no sense of urgency from any employee, and while I like the laid back style, at some point it shouldn't take 10 minutes for an iced coffee to be prepared, with no line ahead of you. On each and every visit, it was just a shit-show of service. On two occasions, and owner was sitting at the bar, either talking to friends, or another time a vendor. As the line grew from one customer, to four, finally the owner got up and started helping his employee, who was clearly in the weeds. Listen, I get that you have to order stuff, and take care of the business side, but if you ignore the paying customers who are right there- then soon you won't have a need for vendors. I say that with all due respect, and I hope the advice is heeded.  -Products, so the iced vanilla latte (three of them) never had any vanilla flavor that I could detect. All three occasions I couldn't detect any vanilla, and while I don't need to be clubbed over the head with flavor- a hint would be nice. I had some coffee cake which was super dry, to the extent that it should be served with a red flag warning. I tried to order pizza one time, but then saw the person in back lean into a freezer to pull some component out to heat and serve. I quickly cancelled that order- if you can't do fresh- don't bother.  In closing- I want this place to succeed- the Dale needs indie places, but they MUST start paying attention to detail. If they don't do that, and get a sense of urgency- this place will close, and all their hard work will be for nada."}
{"text":"In town on vacation, needed a spot with good wifi and coffee to catch up on work and relax. Absolutely fantastic. Favorite coffeeshop I've had the pleasure to visit. Quality of food and beverages was great, staff was friendly and attentive. Had a great French Press, followed by a local lager while I work, because hey, it's vacation. Highly recommend. Now if they could open one back home...."}
{"text":"Great music. Great vibes, great food and the greatest coffee. That is all you need to know. Not such a hipster clusterfudge like Lux. Room to breathe inside and out. Put your hands up on my hips when I sip you sip we sip!"}
{"text":"Great spot to hang out or get some work done. I like this place because it has the charm and decor of a cool, independent coffee shop without the pretentious nature.   Food menu looked pretty solid, will definitely have to give it a go. Overall, good coffee, lots of beer and drinks to choose from, and really friendly staff."}
{"text":"I don't think there are enough nice things I can say about this place. I have spent a crazy amount of hours here studying, drinking, eating, and doing yoga! The people that work here truly go out of their way to make your day better! I honestly feel like it is a home away from home. The beers on tap are always great and they are always willing to help you find the best one for you!   Hummus for happy hour is so yummy.  Cocktails are mixed to perfection every time."}
{"text":"Friendly staff and management perfect capps excellent breakfast delish Pastries  Great music and ambience  will defn be Back!"}
{"text":"Love, love, love this (not so) little coffee shop!  If you are walking South on Scottsdale Road and looking for a cool place to just \"hang\" a bit, keep walking until you get to SIP (at the corner of Goldwater and Scottsdale Roads).  I love it for so many reasons, mostly because it is cool, but not modern, and hip, but not hipster.  The Staff is friendly and genuine.  And to be very frank, I was completely surprised that I loved the Iced Cartel Americano.  OK, I 've had Americano at Cartel, and I SWEAR it doesn't taste nearly as good!  And the vibe is much, much better.  It's \"homier\" than the \"I'm-so-creative-I-don't-even-have-an-office\" coffee shop crowd.  And I love that I can bring my dog!  :-)"}
{"text":"Cute little coffee place.  Love the decor!  Very laid back atmosphere and down to earth. Great parking.  Got a chai tea latte and a breakfast bagel sandwich which were both great.  Dog friendly patio a plus!  Not a fan of the coffee cake tho."}
{"text":"Love this local coffee/beer joint. I have gone already a couple of times and love the atmosphere and the coffee. I tried AEROPRESS and fell in love with the taste and smoothness of this style of brew. They had a live solo musican playing coffeehouse type of music (guitar and voice), it really is a nice touch and great way for local musicans to jam and get exposure. I love how they had the windows open inside and allowed the natural air to come in. They also have an outdoor patio, board games and light bites. Unfortunately, I looked up them up before I visited and saw that they offerred tamales, however; that is not the case anymore in which I was disappointed. They need to update their on line menu!! I tried the BREAKFAST SANDWICH, it did the job but there was NO roasted tomato vinaigrette in it instead there was MAYO- yuck. I didnt feel like complaining as I was slightly hungover. The crowd is a mixture of athletic (yoga girls done up and some that are just there  for the coffee not the scene), couples and lots of university students. Its fun to watch everyone and get your coffee buzz on.  Loved their coffee and the vibe!"}
{"text":"This place has such a great atmosphere! I would love to hangout and get work done here. They have really comfy chairs for socializing, high top bar seating as well as some more standard tables as well.   I had their pesto breakfast sandwich and was very impressed. However it's not listed on their website menu so be sure to check the menu they have on the counter before ordering to see all the options.  Based off of other Yelp reviews I tried the Kevlar Coffee, thinking it was just a brand name coffee. It's not. Apparently it has butter in it, and there's some science behind it as to how it makes your energy last longer. Wasn't my cup of tea, (get it? ) but apparently it's a thing now so just beware!   Definitely want to try going back in the evening to try their beers. They have Firestone Walker on tap, one of my favorite central coast breweries, so I can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"Coffee was great but they're a little pricey. They had live music on when we stopped in on a Saturday morning. Talented! Cute place and definitely somewhere to grab a good cup of coffee and relax. Looks like they had some good breakfast items and snacks as well."}
{"text":"Visited twice in one day. The selection of food is a little thinner than I'd like, but the service was courteous, humorous, competent, and quick. Drink quality was solid for the price.   Power outlets available for long laptop work, as well as WiFi that was completely reliable for the times I was there.   This would overall be a four-star review, losing one for the mediocre food selection (if you're on a keto or low-carb diet, you're not gonna be able to eat here at all), buuuuuuut...  It loses a second star because all the seating in the whole place is kind of this weird hipster stuff, folding chairs or metal bandstand-looking things. Almost all of it is hard metal and uncomfortable. Not ideal for sitting and getting work done for a long afternoon.   It wasn't bad enough that I won't go back, but it's bad enough to keep it down to a 3-star. If they had seating that didn't make your butt go numb, I'd be able to more honestly recommend it. Great atmosphere, good location. Parking sucks, but that's Scottsdale's fault, not Sip's."}
{"text":"This was the site of a Sunday noon coffee meetup that I attended. The cafe/beer house is very casual, with lots of indoor seating and a pleasant patio area where our group hung out. There was a live performance by singer/guitarist Sydney Sprague that afternoon and she was very good. I ordered a cappuccino and some tamales (red chili beef and a green chili chicken), followed a bit later by a macchiato; all of those were very good.  Parking was limited, though, and it took quite a while for me to get the things I had ordered. Other than these little details, the whole experience was pleasant. And there was free wifi, and I especially liked that outside the patio there were abundantly flowering shrubs which were attracting hummingbirds."}
{"text":"Great place! Adorable inside. Spoke to the owner for a while- super friendly. Food was great and the coffee was excellent. The pork belly and waffle sandwich was tasty! Def will be back!"}
{"text":"This place is my jam. The service is amazing, the vibe is great, the wifi is fast and the place is brimming with rad people doing amazing things. Alex and the whole crew are always friendly and fun."}
{"text":"I popped in to this location for a coffee meeting today and absolutely loved it! Their patio is quaint and hip, fully equipped with misters for the warmer months! I LOVE their cold brew. It gives you the perfect caffeine buzz to kickstart a busy day! I will most definitely be back again to get some work done and \"sip\" on their delicious coffee!"}
{"text":"This is my favorite coffee spot so far in Scottsdale. The service is always top notch. The coffee is delicious and they will get creative if you don't see something on the menu you would like. The interior design and decoration is really cool and hip. A great place to sit and talk with friends over a coffee or a beer."}
{"text":"Updated my review from 4-5. Great place, staff is super friendly.  Every review is spot on, great place. Tip: TRY THEIR KEVLAR COFFEE, fairly sure one of the only coffee shops that do this. I just wish they had a tad more emphasis on food. Is probably the best coffee shop in the old town area due to the space itself and staff."}
{"text":"Coffee & Beer? Why didn't I think of that? These guys serve Cartel coffee (which I love) and they serve something called Kevlar coffee. AKA Bulletproof coffee. It's super yummy. Check it out!  I love the mix of people here. From business people to hipsters and everything in between all enjoying the great vibe here.  Indoor and outdoor seating. It's a sweet spot. I look forward to to trying beer at some point soon!"}
{"text":"I love this spot! I'm always on the lookout for fun coffee hangouts, and Sip has it all. Fun, quirky decor, a friendly staff, and a cool vibe. My cousin and I stopped in this past weekend. I ordered a chai latte with soy, we found window seats, and we spent the next few hours chatting away! It seems like a great place to grab a bite to eat or to sit and study. I will DEFINITELY be back... gotta try one of their draft beers next!"}
{"text":"We stopped in for a quick drink and were pleasantly surprised by the great selection and friendly staff. They are hip, but not hipsters! They have a great selection of craft beer and coffee. You can build your own flight of beer samples for $1.50/ea if you feel like trying a few new things. They also have a keg of cold press coffee! The manager is a nice guy who knows his beer and coffee. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"I had to try this shop after hearing numerous friends tell me that I'd be in love with it. I was apprehensive as I am not a huge fan of the fast-paced night vibe of old town scottsdale. Thankfully, they were right!   I brought my books and my laptop here to study. Upon entering, it was the perfect noise level. The music was relaxing and enough to drown out the crowd without disturbing your studies.  I was amongst those on dates, working lunches, and delving into a good novel.   It was as if my coffee house dreams had come true.   Their menu consists of craft brews, a few cocktails and wines, coffee of all types, and lunch items. It was very inexpensive compared to most coffee houses that I frequent. The sandwiches looked light but satisfying, although I did not get to try one.   Forget the library, this is my new sanctuary!"}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite spots in Old Town. Very laid back vibe. A breath of fresh air in Douchedale. Great place to grab coffee or a draft beer. The staff is friendly and they have live music on occasion.   The patio is my favorite. I can hang out with my dogs and enjoy a good IPA. Huzzah."}
{"text":"Deep Sigh  I was so excited about this place from the moment I walked in. Sips is a small place, but has a great indoor/outdoor space that is dog friendly! But... it fell short on delivery.   Don't get me wrong, I'm going to give it a try again, because I'm hopeful that it was just a one-time mishap.   I don't want to get in to all the details, but we stopped in for breakfast and the experience was kind of odd.  I ordered a burrito off the menu and it when it arrived it was missing two of the main ingredients as described on the menu. When I brought it back, the guy seemed surprised that I was displeased and acted almost as if I should just deal with it.  Since these were apparently premade by Brat Haus, I ordered a breakfast sandwich instead.  It was fine.... nothing special.  I think sips  is going to be a better Happy Hour spot, since it has a nice draft selection and pizza... you can't screw up pizza right? To Be continued...."}
{"text":"This is my south Scottsdale hangout. It is such a laid back atmosphere and I've never had an issue in my years of coming here. Sip Bar has a few locations across the Valley and this is their original. They are all about bringing the coffee and beer crowd together under one roof. They have about 20 beers on tap alongside their large selection of bottled beers. For coffee, they use Cartel coffee and serve up a variety of espresso drinks, cold brew and teas. In addition to coffee and beer, they have a light menu that includes sandwiches, salads, breakfast and a cocktail menu. The best part of this place for me is the atmosphere. I come here a lot to read or meet with friends. I get a lot accomplished whenever I stop by and at the same time I get a great cup of coffee. The staff is great! They are always super nice and will answer any question you have. If you want to sit outside, the patio area is nice and shaded. Thanks Sip Bar for creating a great space for us quiet busy bodies that appreciate good beer or coffee. Definitely check out happy hour from 4-7 or some hear some live music in the evenings. There's usually available parking spots behind the building on Bishop Ln. Old town Scottsdale is just a few blocks away if you are up for a stroll after your beverage."}
{"text":"Thanks to Timothy B.'s review on Sip Coffee & Beer Hourse (woot, woot -- shoutout!), I bookmarked this little spot a while back, hoping that I'd be in the south Scottsdale area and have time to swing by and check it out. Well, yesterday I did just that; and I'm glad I did!   I walked in and immediately was like \"woah, this place is awesome!\" The decor is simple yet sophisticated, it's very chill (the people and staff), and everyone was incredibly friendly. I only had a little bit of time to spare, so I didn't go all out and splurge on any pastries or their beer selection (afterall, it was only 11am... on a Monday. haha). I asked the barista what he recommended -- and he told me that basically anything is wonderful. One item on the menu caught my eye though -- the Kevlar coffee -- and I asked what it was. The barista explained that it was coffee with grass-fed butter and oil to get you those good yummy fats your body needs (and probably craves!) He did such a great job at explaining that I was sold! Got the Kevlar coffee in an adorably cute red mug (don't mind my mug obsession... lol).   I sat outside since it was an absolute beautiful day, and the sweet barista brought my coffee outside for me to enjoy. The Kevlar coffee definitely hit the spot, and although the barista said I might think it's too buttery/greasy, I thought it was smooth and creamy, and absolutely delicious!   I really enjoyed stopping by -- wish I would've had more time to try some of their yummy food items... but that just means I'll have to stop by again... and soon!"}
{"text":"Cool coffee shop - good espresso machine - nice folks - Cartel Coffee beans - what's not to love?  (Normally a rhetorical question, but, in this case, the parking - if you can't find a spot there, you can park across the way at the drug store - they pay for overflow parking there).  Good place to come in, get some java and relax.  Check them out!"}
{"text":"Disappointing visit today, they no longer offer the BLT and one of the lounge chairs had zero lateral support and fell over when I sat on it.  They could pick up a nicer chair at a yard sale for $25 or less, there's no excuse for that, unlikely I'll be coming back."}
{"text":"Ugh. I really didn't like the hipster or owner that served me coffee today. That being said, the cold brew was pretty much inedible. I was hoping for a better experience than my 1st visit (when they opened their doors) but there are way better places to get my coffee buzz on.   Also, it was SO hot integrate at 10am this morning. They need A/C!!!   Sorry Sip, I'll skip your Arcadia location too. Even though I live a hop, skip, jump away."}
{"text":"I've been to this place two times now and both times it was a great low-key place. First time was later in the afternoon for an appetizer and beer, and this time it was a Saturday morning for coffee that turned into an afternoon with sandwiches. Fantastic live music and enough space to grab a seat. Good place to grab food, too.  Friendly to all ages, including families with kids."}
{"text":"Quaint atmosphere, decent menu and prices. Great meeting place. I would definitely use this spot over Starbucks any day."}
{"text":"Hot Coffee and/or Cold Beer for whatever may ail you... Well located on the corner of Scottsdale Rd & Goldwater Blvd, pop in real quick or stay awhile... Loving this place."}
{"text":"Such a charming coffee shop by Goldwater Brewing. They have cocktails and a nice rotating list of craft beers, but the few times I've been I get a nice latte and enjoy their tunes and the chill atmosphere... they can get pretty busy if you aren't there in the mornings on a weekend... have also had their hummus which is a nice snack to share with a friend while catching up! Parking is limited!"}
{"text":"Always a fun and chill vibe here. They have live musicians and the space has lots of windows and it's all very light and bright. Food is delish! I always get the breakfast sandwich and their mocha. Coffee and beer are great and the service is good!"}
{"text":"This place is a really nice place to hang out with friends or just get some work done. My friend and I happened to pass this place on the way to lunch, and then went back to check it out. I'm glad we did because it's got great coffee and tea. And it also has a full bar! How cool is that, have a drink while you get some work done. They also have food. They have a patio in back with lots of shade. The front was nice and sunny. Milk alternatives include almond and soy milk."}
{"text":"The ingredients are pretty good quality, with the exception of bacon.  The portions are rather small for the prices.  The brownie was the only fiscally savvy purchase made!  Definitely recommend the brownie!  :)"}
{"text":"Such a great neighborhood coffee and beer shop!  We stopped in this weekend and snagged a table on the large, pet friendly patio.  Our pooch enjoyed hanging out with us and the staff was very welcoming.  They have a really nice coffee and beer list...definitely a few unique choices too.  I could get used to hanging out at Sip!"}
{"text":"Came here on a Friday night with my wife and had an amazing time!  Star 1 is for the food quality. We got bruschetta and a pretzel. They were both good but the bruschetta was better.  Star 2 is for the food being worth the price! For the 10 bucks we paid for both our appetizers, the price wasn't bad at all.  Star 3 is for the amazing atmosphere. The atmosphere of this place is very unique and nice for a chill night with whoever, especially with the live music.  Star 4 is for the Wow factor. I was really wowed by  the atmosphere and feel of this place altogether.   I couldn't give a fifth star for the service because all we ordered were the two appetizers and it took a good 20 minutes or more to get them which wasn't the worst but considering the amount of people there it should have come out faster."}
{"text":"Page and crew were fantastic. Live music and great coffee, ordered break sandwich. No regrets, stayed for several hours.   Highly recommend."}
{"text":"Best chai tea latte! The selection of beers were pretty awesome & we loved the super chill vibe. This is such a nice place to come & listen to live music while sipping on some fab coffee (or beer). I highly recommend. I also picked up a PB cookie that had a Reese's cup inside...SOOOO good!"}
{"text":"Welp... here I am sitting at Sip Coffee and Beer House, mid-day, soaking up the free Wi-Fi and trying to change my life. I immediately ordered a Cartel Coffee cold brew. If you're ordering for the first time, get a large, you'll thank me later.   *Orders another coffee*  Scrolling through LinkedIn jobs I've recently decided I want a new job that I can enjoy. For all you job searchers out there I'm sure you understand that this is easier said than done. Why can't job postings just be real? Inside Sales Rep? I think what you really mean is sitting on the phone making 100 cold-calls a day. Pass.   *Orders another coffee*  OH! OH! Community Managers at Yelp? I love Phoenix! I'm a social connector! I have a fire in my belly! Wait, what? Forget that part... Pick me! Pick me!   ^ That was my exact reaction... until I scrolled to the bottom of the page, read a blog, and stalked Hilary H. for over an hour. I've now decided two things: 1. I will never be able to write 1000 reviews over night and 2. 2,448 friends? Is she for real? I think I have 19.   *Switches from coffee to beer*  *Calls mom to cry*  *Calls best friend to cry more*  After my emotional roller coaster ended, I put on some gangster rap. I prefer \"I'mma Shine\" by Youngbloodz, because if it's good enough to motivate Channing Tatum in Step Up, it's good enough for me.   I also ordered a breakfast sandwich. It comes on an everything-bagel, huge bonus, and of course I added bacon. I actually ordered it without any roasted tomato vinaigrette because that flavor combo seemed pretty intimidating to me. Lo and behold, the Sip kitchen knows me better than I know myself and added it anyways. Boy, am I glad they did.   On a real note: this place is great! If you're looking for some free Wi-Fi, a beer to cry over, or a carb-o-load to start your day you'll feel right at home here."}
{"text":"Found this place on Yelp after leaving the Scottsdale Museum of Contemporary Art. Went here on a whim and it was a great way to end our date. We ordered a cocktail, a pretzel, and Not Your Father's Root Beer. Average price, great, friendly service. The misters outside make for a cool(ish) summer night. The live music tonight was okay. Will come back for coffee and company, or maybe a good book."}
{"text":"The atmosphere inside is very cozy; it feels like your living room, with worn-in couches and recliners. The tables are a bit clumsy and uncomfortable, but that's forgiveable. Excellent selection of beers on draft, and good prices -- happy hour before 7pm takes a dollar off the pint. My biggest complaint is the music -- it tends to be a bit loud during the day (I understand on Friday or Saturday night, but 2pm in the afternoon?), and one of the employees there exclusively plays reggae music... and plays it constantly. Doesn't vibe well with the atmosphere; it's Scottsdale, not Jamaica or Long Beach. I can take reggae in limited doses, it's fine, but it gets really old after a while, especially at that volume, and makes it difficult to concentrate without having to put in headphones (which most people seem to be doing). That said, very very chill place, definitely check it out"}
{"text":"I love the ambience, I think it's a really relaxing atmosphere and they have a great patio. I went in with a girlfriend this past Sunday morning and they had live music which was great!   That being said My my friend and I were both disappointed with our coffee. I could tell it was going to be a rocky start because the barista messed the ladies order before us. Seems like she got a but flustered and had the other barista fix it for her.  My friend and I ordered the same drink, two hot pumpkin spice lattes. One came out correctly the other came out as ice. The male barista was very kind and redid my friends order.   I tried the pumpkin spice and it honestly didn't taste like anything to me. The espresso was too bitter and no sweetness of the pumpkin to balance it. Two packets of sugar later and it tasted bearable.  I wasn't impressed with the coffee and neither was my friend.   I would still come back to this place but maybe for having a cocktail, not coffee."}
{"text":"Really cool vibes and aesthetic in here. They have lots of seating (inside and outside) and board games. I got a white mocha and it was really delicious. We also got the pesto breakfast sandwich, which was good but it took about 20 minutes to make. The guy taking our order wasn't the friendliest either."}
{"text":"This place is pretty much my home away from home. That's partly because my apartment sucks and I hate it, but it's mostly because of the chill vibe, great coffee for the morning, and excellent beer selection (and cocktails!) for the afternoon. What more could you want? Staff is super friendly and personable. Wifi is solid. I heart Sip."}
{"text":"It was fine.  Though you have to beg for cream and a sugar packet b/c they don't have them out.  Thus you get stuck waiting in line again.  I'm in no rush to go back."}
{"text":"Great beers and very Chill setting. Ferric place to hang out with friends and catch up. Although I did not get a chance for food, I hear the burritos are very good. Stop by and relax."}
{"text":"Definitely a cute place. I love the used furniture and eclectic decor. My mom and I stopped in here for breakfast and coffee. The coffee was pretty good. The breakfast offerings are minimal and a bit over-priced in my opinion for how small they were.   I'm still a bit perplexed on the idea of this place... Is it a drink place with just a couple bite items? It's it a coffee lounge to bring your laptop to? It's not a restaurant... It isn't a breakfast spot or dinner spot. I dunno maybe I will have to go again to figure it out."}
{"text":"Super cute atmosphere and friendly service. Love the patio and that it's dog friendly! Not a huge fan of cartel coffee though, but I do love the iced coffee! This is my go to spot for coffee dates with girlfriends!"}
{"text":"Stopped in for happy hour as shown on the Sip website. Only to find out the employee running the cash register had no clue about the happy hour when I asked, he couldn't even provide a happy hour menu? Frustrating as a customer. Ordered hummus and a beer payed nearly $18 both were supposed to be on happy hour. Either I was charged wrong or the happy hour isn't so happy? Don't think I'll be returning. Beware prices don't seem accurate or consistent and the receipts are not itemized."}
{"text":"I absolutely LOVE this place. I have never seen anything like this in Arizona, it's exactly what Old Town needed. I love walking in and looking at all of the furniture and decor, everything is so unique and eclectic, it's all so original and different from what everyone else is currently doing. It's really cool that they have butcher paper set up as a suggestion wall and chalkboard in the bathrooms-love those ideas!  I had the breakfast frittata and now I crave it for lunch and dinner! Payton Curry, the chef who makes their food, is a true master at his art. I grew up going to big farmer's markets every week so I appreciate that everything is local and organic (and not to mention delicious)!   Cartel provides their coffee beans and anyone who knows their coffee knows that Cartel roasts the BEST beans in AZ. I saw that someone in a previous review complained about price, but if you know coffee, you know you're getting what you paid for. Plus they have kegged iced coffee!? Didn't even need cream or sugar!  They have a very extensive craft beer menu and serve flights in muffin tins, awesome! The walk up cooler is a great idea too! It's nice that they have a set cocktail menu. You don't see that really anywhere in Arizona, I've only seen it in places like New York and Seattle. They take a little to make but it's so worth the wait considering everything is hand pressed, muddled, and mixed right in front of you.    The staff is extremely friendly, I enjoy going to a new spot where you don't see the normal or typical \"Scottsdale\" employee. It's a breath of fresh air.   This is such a great place in all aspects. I'm making this the official place I meet my friends for coffee, food, cocktails, and beer spot!"}
{"text":"Great place to study or catch up with friends. I just wish they were open till at least 10:30 on weekdays. I think other customers would agree and it would also bring in a night crowd. Most other coffee shops are closed at 9:00 as well and I think any of my fellow night owls trying to get work done later would like a place like this to stay open a little longer."}
{"text":"First things first, the actual parking lot here is awful just find street parking because you'll want to stay here a while. The place itself is cute but also a bit strange in the details of the decor. There is often live music at night too.   The coffee is decent, pricy for what it is. The food is actually really tasty, but also pretty pricy. The standout here are the drinks.  Thru have a massive amount of beer on tap and if they aren't busy probably will let you taste something before committing to it. The cocktails are strong and drinkable. They aren't cheap, but they aren't outrageously priced either."}
{"text":"Sip is a great location for slow Saturdays with friends or family. It's casual and a place for great coffee. If you have work to do, there are tables inside and outside to check out. The last time I was here my mom and I split the Chemex which was yummy and a couple of pastries that were delicious as well. If you're in the area, stop by for a cup of coffee!"}
{"text":"This is a cute little coffee shop! I ordered some cold brew with almond milk and it was delicious. They served it in a mason jar, which I thought was a nice touch!   Parking is very limited, but the ambiance of the place is trendy and friendly. In addition to beer and coffee, they also serve food and yummy pastries!   This is a fun place to catch up on some work, enjoy an afternoon snack, and get a little pick me up."}
{"text":"Awesome environment, drinks and decor. Nice place to study, catch up with friends, play board games, listen to music, etc. Favorite new coffee house!"}
{"text":"Great little spot.  Went there to meet a client for coffee but I will have to go back for a beer and some cards against humanity.  Had an iced mocha was very good and on par with expectations.  I had a pastry that was probably the best coffee house pastry I have had.  I would recommend this for a day time coffee house atmosphere or a casual night with some friends.  Parking is a nightmare all the time so be prepared, although it is for that whole area so not really their fault but still annoying."}
{"text":"I love this place! Good selection of beers and food is really good too! Music is perfect volume and style. Perfect place to hang out and relax, take a first date or catch up with friends. I am so glad I live so close. Will definitely spend more time here and take friends and family."}
{"text":"1. They totally have bulletproof coffee which no one has keto on!! 2. It was cheat day had the breakfast sandwich was dank but I think it had some sort of vigaigrette on there was lovely like tomatoes in not sure if it's the placement on the bagel (towards the bottom ) but it left it kind of soggy after a minute (still completely yum)  3. Note the stars on the menu may mean it's either only avail on Saturday or Sunday or that it's limited quantities  Other than that chill vibe decent tunes and the beer list could be somewhere in Colorado kinda expensive but such is Scottsdale   There's def a normal crowd or a lot of people just know each other"}
{"text":"Beautiful atmosphere, and coffee is amazing. Had the hummus, -EXCELLENT  (though I wish they'd serve more than 2 tblsp of it)"}
{"text":"Awesome addition to Old Town. Feel is warm and welcoming. The mint tea & macchiato are very good along with their fresh pastries! A must go!"}
{"text":"This is about as good as it gets.  Great coffee.  Awesome outdoor deck with abundant shade.  It serves excellent coffee.  I also have a weakness for places that transition from coffee houses to low key bars in the evening.    Been here multiple times and I plan to go back."}
{"text":"A typical coffee place.  Furniture interestong"}
{"text":"This is a nice little place tucked away on the south end of Old Town. Great atmosphere and coffee; this is the place to meet a friend or sit for a spell with a good book. I definitely will stop by for another visit whenever I'm in Scottsdale."}
{"text":"This place rocks. And if the owner is the hot hipster I think he is, it's well worth 15 minute drive. I read a lot of you bitching about the pizza. If you don't like frozen pizza, then for fuck's sake don't order it. It's not a full blown restaurant, it's a place for small snacks, amazing coffee and beer. I've lived in Arizona since January and before finding this place was starting to get really sad the only place to have coffee was Starbucks. This area needs more independent businesses like this one. If you're going to bitch about loud music and how low the A/C is, then bring headphones and a flipping jacket. It's not tough. Or here's an idea... stay home."}
{"text":"First off, I'm the last guy to write a review. I think this is my first. But i feel compelled after my experience, so here goes. BUYER BEWARE!!  Bad food, worse drinks, rude staff. Bottom line, don't waste your time. Terrible parking to boot. Waste of a Saturday afternoon. I guess if your a cool hipster this place is for you; but if your looking for an alternative to Starbucks thats local and awesome, McDonalds is better than this place.  Greatly disappointed!!!"}
{"text":"Two thumbs up for atmosphere and service. Badass place to have a real beer in a relaxing/laid back environment. Nothing like a good tasting, high percent brew right out of the tap. Owners and employees are awesome as well. Haven't tried the food yet but I imagine it matches the rest of the experience. Cheers!"}
{"text":"Great coffee!  Beans are from local Cartel coffee.  Parking is usually a hassle in old town, but there's a large lot across the street for Walgreens and Staples shoppers that I park at."}
{"text":"Awesome decor and super clean place. I stopped in and ordered a cold brew on a Saturday morning. I'm pretty sure that the prices on the overhead menu and the actual menu were different. The line was very long but as I said it was Saturday morning. It is possible that someone didn't show up for their shift but I would definitely suggest two people at the counter.  My cold brew was very strong and it was really enjoyable. Since I had been out and about, I was going to order a bagel or muffin. That changed when the girl in front of me ordered a muffin and found that the bottom was covered in MOLD. While I was waiting for my coffee, I noticed that the rest of the muffins that were sitting out has green, fuzzy mold covering them. I alerted the guy behind the counter. He didn't seem to care and said \"Yeah I'll get to them.\" Personally, I would take care of moldy food sitting right in plain view of customers ASAP. They lost a sale over it!"}
{"text":"This is a super hipster joint. They nonchalantly ignore you so you beg for service! lol At least that is my experience but here is the deal. I did not know that it was counter only service. I DID know that they are dog friendly which being a big animal lover with 4 dogs that lives in the neighborhood is a big deal for me. I will throw my hard earned bucks to local establishments like this! I decided to go in today with one of my dogs and tried to get service which at first it was ok. I got a younger gentleman in which I was able to get his attention, then an older guy (Bryan) that I have seen my one other visit there before took over the bar area. Since I know I cannot walk in with my dog I tried to get his attention. Bryan saw me but obviously decided best to not ask me if I need any help or anything at all and talk to some folks (probably regulars) at the bar area and JUST IGNORE ME. I went back to my table upset and disappointed. I wanted to stay and have another drink and even order food but I decided against it. I expressed my feelings to him on the service. I told him it was an opportunity lost on their end. They had my card on hold as I was planning on staying longer and I asked for it back. He did comp me and I was appreciative of the fact- just wish it did not have to come to that.   I will give them another try...just hope the owner reads this and knows customer service is EVERYTHING."}
{"text":"There are very few times I find the perfect place to enjoy a fabulous cup of coffee (and I mean real cup of perfectly roasted coffee beans, not the unleaded gas station stuff ) friendly employees, an open creative atmosphere, and yet a professional place of business.  If you have yet to check out this place, try it before you leave Scottsdale! I wish we had a Sip in Nashville, TN! I miss their Bulletproof (aka: Kevalier Coffee) and yoga on Sunday mornings! Check it out, you will NOT regret it!"}
{"text":"Good coffee, cool decor and a quiet spot to get work done? Count me in.  Sip has a great atmosphere. It feels cozy and they have nice comfy chairs to settle into while typing away at your next Yelp review.  The only thing going against Sip is the parking lot. I had trouble finding a spot and it was a late Sunday afternoon. I can't imagine what it's like during peak times."}
{"text":"Great place. Live music, awesome local atmosphere, delicious coffee and craft brew and fresh made pasties! If you're in old town Scottsdale, check it out!!"}
{"text":"Love this place!! Fantastic atmosphere, food, & coffee! Customer service is personable & enjoyable! HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!"}
{"text":"One of my favorite stops in old town. You definitely can't limit it to simply a coffee shop, in addition to a great set of caffeinated beverages they have an excellent selection of beer and cocktail options. I highly recommend visiting during happy hour for some significant discounts."}
{"text":"Good music, excellent decor, and best coffee in area.  Cartel is locally roasted and they brew them well.  You can taste the quality. Has a small breakfast and lunch menu with good choices using high quality ingredients.  Very good choices of beer and a full bar."}
{"text":"Awesome spot! Great outdoor seating, great indoor seating, great drinks and yummy food! The staff is really friendly and quick, too. Plus great community events like outdoor yoga, and live music too - love this place!  They have multiple patios, as well as an indoor section with comfy seats plus metal tables - whatever you need!   My husband had a chai latte with almond milk and I had a black tea with mango - both yummy. Happy hour lasts until 7pm every day, so we ordered the tasty bruschetta- everything's made from scratch, in-house, and it shows! Later we split a huge pretzel for $5 - also great!"}
{"text":"Great place to relax with a coffee or beer.  Very friendly and helpful staff.  Dog friendly patio, free wifi, pastries, sandwiches, snacks.  You feel like you are in your own living room....take a friend or just your laptop."}
{"text":"I've been wanting to come here for a while..and after a few visits I kick myself for not coming sooner! This place is adorable! Being a true southern girl I enjoy some of the cozy decor that reminds me of back home :)   I work out in the field for my job so I often like to find local coffee shops to work out of. (That are NOT Starbucks) Not only is this place cozy and welcoming but they have great food, plenty of seating and AMAZING coffee.  When I get iced coffee they serve Cartel Coffee on tap, you can't go wrong with that. When I'm in the mood for hot I get the Bulletproof coffee! So excited to see a coffee shop serve this! (I spy a crossfitter!) What's that? You don't know what bulletproof coffee is?? Well you must come order a cup! ASAP!  it makes you feel bulletproof! Good for those dreaded Mondays!   The breakfast frittata is the only breakfast dish I've had thus far..it's served with local eggs, haus bacon, spinach, Swiss cheese, organic arugula tossed in pecan pesto & roasted tomato vinaigrette (I got it without the 9 grain bread) and it was fabulous!!!!   They have an awesome dog friendly patio with lots of seating (for when it's not 500° outside). Unless you are one of the odd balls who enjoy the desert summer!!?  And their schedule hosts some live music, open mic night and music bingo, along with trivia coming in the future! Sounds fun!   Only downside is parking is a little scarce so you may have to park in the Walgreens or staples lot and take a short walk over. And when I ordered the pretzel It was good but just a little dry. Other than that no complaints and I will continue to set up shop here :) thanks for bringing a great local coffee shop to the area guys!"}
{"text":"Cool place and they make bulletproof type coffee! Will stop by again when I visit AZ!"}
{"text":"FINALLY!  A true coffee place with a PNW vibe!  Sure I miss home, but want to live HERE!  This place is perfect, and so close to my casa.  The atmosphere was great, vibe was on point and service most excellent.  Hubs (who is picky) said \"best waffles EVAAAA\"....I loved my breakfast burrito.  Wish you had more on lunch menu, but I am sure it will grow.  Super hipster.  Love it!  Will be back asap to try the beer.  LOVED the coffee!!!!!"}
{"text":"Went on Easter Sunday on way to family gathering with my son and his wife. The musician created a \"I want to listen mood\", I am 66 and felt very comfortable sitting at bar. The  craft cocktails and vast beer selection were spot on for me.  Disappointed that Undertow was closed, but it was Easter."}
{"text":"Kevlar coffee here is amazing!  Great patio and breezy through the whole place when they keep the windows open on a nice day!"}
{"text":"Sip offers a choice if you are with a group and Connor decide if you want coffee or beer. As the name implies, you can get both here!  The coffee for my taste, was ok, just not to my tastes. The beer choices looked decent enough to satisfy most. They have a limited food menu, but I did not try any.  There are tables both inside and out, where you can get some work done. However, My one suggestion with Sip and most other coffee houses, is the lack of outlets. I realize adding outlets can be expensive, so run some cords!"}
{"text":"Great design and super nice owners! I work down the street and stop in for ice tea's and coffee often. Appreciate the local vibe and open windows. Great outside seating too if the weather is nice. Do yourself a favor and skip the corporate giant and head across the street to Sip!"}
{"text":"It's a shame I didn't discover this place until recently. The exterior is kind of sketchy/janky, so for the longest time I thought it was a drug front. Then, one casual Sunday when I was on a Yelp-fueled coffee house extravaganza, I saw Sip had many 5 star reviews. It was only then with the assurance of Yelpers Phoenix-wide, that I dared venture inside and discovered it is a #trendy #hipster PARADISE! I love it here! Great ambiance, great cool brew, great fake flowers, great painted mason jars, great conversation, great staff, great fun signs on the wall, great Instagramming opportunities. I LOVE THIS PLACEEE and it's not a drug front (that I know of)!!!"}
{"text":"A friend of mine recommended this as his go to work remote spot and I enjoyed it but seating was scarce when I first got in and parking is not fun at all and this is during the summer. The peak times must be brutal."}
{"text":"Adorable little spot. The parking lot is full often but there is street parking close! Great almond milk chai and the nice barista checked to make sure the Chai mix was Vegan!"}
{"text":"Discovered this little gem a couple months ago and have since been several times. Cartel coffee is a win, though I tried their version of Bulletproof (which I do at home) and it tasted awful. Love the little patio and inside sofas that look like they belonged to my late grandmother sans the plastic covers They also have beers on tap so I'll need to check it out later in the day...can't really justify an 8am brew on a Tuesday"}
{"text":"I've walked past this place several times and decided that tonight, while out on a walk with my dog that we'd stop by for a quick drink. After seeing on yelp Sip allows dogs, I was excited to try it out. Since it was almost closing time I ordered an ice coffee and a cup of water for my dog. I was quickly given my coffee and was told they would bring the water out to me for my dog. I was pleased to see a water bowl brought out to the patio for my four-legged friend! While I did not catch the employees name, he quickly made my nervous dog at ease. The employee even went inside and got my dog a piece of bacon as a treat! Inside there was a trivia night going on. Looked like a lot of fun. Can't wait to try some food and a beer next time I stop by... With my dog of course!"}
{"text":"We came here after brunch to grab coffee and chat. The latte was just fine as I couldn't really taste the coffee aroma. However, the extensive menu of all draft beer made me think the beer could be good. This place has a cool and chill vibe, and there is a lot indoor and outdoor (with mist) seating area. A lot of young people working/reading there. When you have a cool place to chill and work, you probably wouldn't be too harsh on the coffee quality. The decor met my expectation at least."}
{"text":"Awesome beer selection.  Cartel American Pale Ale tasted great!  19 drafts with a great happy hour.  They have their own version of a Moscow Mule that is on the happy hour menu.  My wife and I shared the Bruschetta for only $5!! This place is awesome, I would recommend stopping in for a coffee at 8am or for an awesome drink."}
{"text":"Had quite a bit of work to do and needed to find a great place to get caught up - Sip was the place to go! I sat at the bar and had the most attentive and awesome barista - Michelle! It was a great experience and she was wonderful! Thank you, Michelle!"}
{"text":"Very cool place. Amazing selection of beers, great staff. Coffee is good too. Def will be back!"}
{"text":"I sat outside in the little beer garden outside of Sip on a Friday night because I was tired of the hustle and bustle of Old Town. Really great atmosphere and not too crowded either. Reasonable prices and great beer selection!"}
{"text":"They let me bring my doggies here! And they brought them the biggest water bowl! Also the coffee is great. My bread was a little soggy but I don't even care because the breakfast sandwich was beautiful"}
{"text":"This place was really cool! The decor was vintage and a very open environment, the overall atmosphere was very chill. Love the idea of a coffee and Beer house!! Amazing. We went for the coffee and breakfast, coffee was awesome and they had a lot of options. The breakfast menu was a bit more limited, would have liked to see a few more options. Wish they had one of these in Boston!"}
{"text":"Very cool place.  Nice craft beer selection and their lemonade is great."}
{"text":"It's hard to do better than a place that sells both coffee and beer. Nice ambiance, I love to drink coffee/ beer in dry weather!"}
{"text":"I feel like Sip has a lot of potential. I've been to the Scottsdale location a few times and each time is a hit or miss. Just to clarify, I've only had their iced black tea to drink. I have yet to try any of their coffees or beer. Tea is good, but it's hard to mess up iced tea. The atmosphere here is nice. They had live music when I came in the other night so my friend and I opted to sit outside where we could talk. Even though it was about 100 degrees out, their misters were awesome and I didn't even notice the heat. Love the lighting outside and the seating area.   My only beef with this place is the food. Each time I come here they are always out of what I want to order. And whatever I do end up ordering is never that spectacular. The parking is also pretty crazy and I usually end up having to park a couple streets down. If they stepped up their food game I would probably frequent this place much more often."}
{"text":"Love this place! Stopped by for some dinner and drinks and was pleasantly surprised by the simplisticly tasty menu and drinks.  Ordered the veggie tamale, burratta salad, and Italian panini. Veggie tamale was delish and great for a small bite. The salad was refreshing and had some crostini, and my fiancé said the Italian panini brought him right back to fond memories of jersey with the fresh deli meat. I liked that the music was present but not overpowering. The overall atmosphere was very much a coffee house turned hang out at night. Only reason for the 4 stars is that it was a little on the pricey side, however we will be back! Oooh and they're patio is dog friendly!"}
{"text":"Sip is my go-to coffee shop...  I don't know how I haven't yet written a review for this awesome locally owned gem.    This place is hopping morning, mid-day, and night, but it's never been too packed that I couldn't find a seat to meet with a friend, chat with my husband, interview a job candidate, listen to (live on occasion) music, or just zone out and work while taking advantage of their free wi-fi.  Service is always friendly and laid back, which I love.  Whether you want a (Cartel) coffee straight up, a fancier espresso drink or cold brew, your choice of 20ish beers on tap, a cocktail, wine, iced tea, etc... there is something for you on Sip's beverage menu!  There is a decent food menu as well, which includes a few breakfast items, appetizers, salads, and sandwiches.    Sip's Happy Hour is every day from 4pm - 7pm, during which time, they offer: -$1 off all draft wine -$1 off all draft beer -$6 whisky mules -$5 bruschetta -$5 hummus  Sip is opening a second location on Indian School and 36th St at the end of this month... I can't wait to check it out!"}
{"text":"This coffee shop is quickly becoming my favorite hangout. I've been here more than a few time and have always had a great experience. The staff is pleasant, every time I've visit there has been live music, and there is indoor and outdoor seating. In one visit I once hung out for over 4 hours. Additionally, if you enjoy beer they serve ot here as well. The sip is great hang out any time of day."}
{"text":"Wonderful coffee, teas, and pastries! BUT....the blonde who works there was so nasty to me while she was nice to everyone else who approached her. Whenever she took my order, she didn't tell me the price but took my card and flipped the screen to give her a tip. Then, walked away for a few minutes and shoved the pastry I ordered in my face. I'm not sure what is her issue but I'm a regular here and this is the first time receiving bad service."}
{"text":"I have been working here with my boyfriend for a few hours today. We set up camp on the yellow couch, and the environment is very welcoming and appealing to the senses. Fresh air, laid back and productive people here, a good selection of coffee and drinks, and a coffeeshop playlist that has a nice balance between background and rainy day tunes.   Give this place a try if you want to try a nice spot to sit out on the patio with a pup, get some work done, or relax with friends :)"}
{"text":"Very cute coffee shop. Wish they had a few soda options. Food has always been good. Kinda a pain to get in and out if their parking lot."}
{"text":"Favorite coffee shop to get some work done. It's always nice to treat yourself to a beer after a long day of work and cold brew. Absolutely love coming here on Wednesdays as it is open mic night. The hosts are pretty cool dudes and I suggest you chop it up with both."}
{"text":"It really is as chill as it sounds, and it has just enough of a hipster vibe so that it's cool but doesn't look like it's trying too hard. It also has different seating for whatever you're looking to do when you're there whether that be grabbing a beer with your friends at some of the tables, getting some work done by the couches, or hanging around the patio to enjoy the weather.   It's a great place to unwind but also a great place to take care of some work. Love it!"}
{"text":"Espresso game strong with a quick pull and a pour. If your debating on the breaking burro or Sammy. Pull the trigger on the burro its damn clutch!"}
{"text":"Came here after dinner!  Love the vibe and all they offer.  I got a green ice tea and a snicker doodle cupcake.  We kicked it in the area with comfy chairs and chatted."}
{"text":"Nice espresso pull, cool space and they serve beer. What's not to like?"}
{"text":"This location and the other SIP location are easily the best coffee places in the valley to work from the computer at or for a little get together with friends or clients. Great spot, perfect cold brew and good food with better people!"}
{"text":"Very chill spot on the edge of downtown Scottsdale, for those who can't decide between a coffee and a craft beer. Seemed like an odd combination, but it works nicely here due to the relaxing vibe, with plenty of space indoors and out to stretch out. Prices not at all out of line, and a very nice change of pace from Starbucks / sports bars / breweries."}
{"text":"Our first experience at Sip was eventful to say the least.  Hubby and I stopped in for lunch because we had a Groupon.  We ordered a sandwich to share and two beers (loved that they had Mother Road Tower Station on tap).  We ordered the Italian and went to the patio to soak up some sun and enjoy our beers.  I was waiting at the bar for the sandwich when a guy brought it out and said they had made the wrong one but would I want that sandwich as well.  Sure! I said.  Hubby and I began to eat it when our \"Italian\" sandwich arrived.  After the first bite, it was apparent that it was not the Italian that we had ordered, but the BLT.  Oh well, we said to eachother.  We didn't feel the need to complain even though we both couldn't beleive that they got our order wrong twice.  As we were eating, someone finally brought out the Italian we had ordered in the first place.  Third times' a charm I guess!    We stopped in for coffee on a bike ride a few weeks after the sandwich debaucle and thought the drinks were pretty standard."}
{"text":"Ordered coffee & then beer-- which was exactly how I wanted to spend my Wednesday afternoon.  Definitely a hipster scene, but I loved  how unique the place was."}
{"text":"This was by far the best iced latte I have had while in Scottsdale. You can really taste the coffee, unlike other places that just taste like sweetened milk. Well done."}
{"text":"Really awesome coffee along with some great staff members and the ideal outdoor patio.   I've tried a few items on the menu and all of them have been stellar.  This place is at the top of my first if I need to get some work done..."}
{"text":"Friendly staff. Loved the vibe. Great place for a coffee and to hunker down and co-work. Nice indoor and outdoor space and a small parking lot."}
{"text":"Man this place has pretty good coffee and good food but the to go packaging must be from Satan I have lost as much food as I have eaten from there b/c the cheap ultra hard spring like plastic pops open shooting the food out in the ground. Also the staff is anti customer satisfaction, lazy and just give the feeling of it's cool to not really work and just do mediocre everything. This place is hell to anyone that has a job or a Brain."}
{"text":"I love this place! The ambiance is so chill and laid back. The music is good too!  It's a cool nighttime (or day) hangout for coffee or beer!"}
{"text":"Great espresso, great ambiance, and I am hoping to go back for what looks like great beer.  Unique shop and I love it!  Across from Starbucks (not their choice), but I would go to Sips any time over Starbucks. Breakfast burrito was ok.  Coffee and beer is definitely stronger (no pun intended) than the food."}
{"text":"Quick stop to grab coffee & cheap good gas on the way specially if drove from Phoenix straight... & gifts too!!;)"}
{"text":"Updated (from 2 to 4):  I go here a lot now and sometimes the music is still a little too loud to concentrate or have a conversation, but it is better.   Simple but tasty eats, wide range of beer on tap.    Original review:  First time there and initially I liked the vibe and decor. And I like Cartel coffees. It's hip without being Scottdaley but also not like other places like Cartel.  But like Anthony, I agree the little details can make or break a having a good time or a disappointing one. For me it was the environmentals that didn't work.  Like most hip coffee joints, they played the music about two notches too loud which  made it hard to just enjoy being there and do some work I had planned on my computer. The WiFi worked fine but it wasn't protected - these days it is nice to have at least basic password protection in a public place if only for piece of mind.   The A/C was about 5-10 degrees too cold (I'm not generally sensitive to cold/hot). I tried sitting in a few different places but there was an arctic downdraft  wherever I sat. I don't normally talk to management in situations like this because they are going for a certain vibe and changing it once for a single customer isn't the point.   They could have had me for several hours sampling noshes and beers if the atmospherics were just a bit towards the comfy-cozy side to  accommodate more intimate conversation and creative thinking. Granted young kids might not notice a thing.  I'll stop by again to give it another chance or two and adjust my review accordingly."}
{"text":"I wish I could give this place a thousand stars. Sip is the most fun, non pretentious, and trendy place in Scottsdale.   We had our wedding rehearsal dinner (30 people) here because we loved the vibe so much. We had catered Mexican food and the patio to ourselves. Twas super laid back and perfect for what we were wanting.  Alex himself is so kind and so accommodating. Working with him was a joy. He made sure our rehearsal dinner was everything we wanted. He even helped us put up our decorations. We are forever thankful to him for such an amazing night! He is such a huge asset to Sip.   Overall, this place cannot be missed! Awesome staff, progressive music, killer coffee, and amazing bar. What else could you want?  The husband and I are so happy to have such a cool spot like this is Scottsdale! Thank you to all of the staff for making our rehearsal dinner so perfect!  PS: This place is a hidden gem. It would be the perfect first date spot if you're looking for one."}
{"text":"Easily the best place in Old Town Scottsdale. They have pretty amazing beer and chip y salsa. Also, the staff is super nice. I usually ride my motorcycle here at least twice a week to just do some homework and chill. Good vibes and sometimes they have live music. They have a second location I went to a couple of time in central PHX."}
{"text":"This place has the best energy! The only con of this coffee shop is the parking... there aren't too many parking spots at the shop itself, so you have to drive around the corner and park on the street if it's full. But, I have been here 2x now, and the coffee is fantastic, service is bar none, and atmosphere is impeccable. It's one of those places where you want to bring you work, take a seat, and dive into your morning. I could spend a few hours here. Great place!"}
{"text":"Love, love, love this place. Great vibe. Awesome coffee. Very friendly service. Oh, and the music is cool, too! So glad they're now in my hood! Even though they're considered to be downtown Scottsdale, they're not just another cheesy Scottsdale frat bar. Will be back often."}
{"text":"Avocado toast is divine! There's no better place than a place where you get to decide if you want coffee or beer or both!"}
{"text":"Great atmosphere but don't expect much from the food. I got a goat cheese salad with chicken. They forgot the goat cheese and the \"chicken\" is sliced, processed deli meat. Only about 3 slices of strawberries and a couple walnuts tossed on top of spinach with a balsamic vinaigrette. The service is ok they added the missing goat cheese when asked but didn't care too much about it."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere and the baristas are very friendly. Whole place kicks ass and Travis and Tida did a great job with the place.  Live music a few times I have been here as well and the acts have been good.  Recommend it if you are in the old town area!"}
{"text":"Sip is appropriately hip. I wish this trendy place originated when I was in college at ASU, I might have actually studied when I went to a coffee shop. Sip provides a lax environment for business meetings, study sessions, or just day to day meeting up for coffee or craft beer.   The patio is dog friendly; therefore my pup is another fan of Sip.   The craft beer selection is large; you won't find a beer you can't enjoy. The coffee is amazing if you order it tall or strong, don't mattahhh. Oddly, I enjoy paying at Sip as much as I enjoy lounging because their tip feature has appropriate saying's in order to justify the tip... if you really are only tipping 15% in today's era, the service was just, \"allllllllright\" If you aren't tipping or tipping the bare minimum, you don't appreciate Sip and what the unique spot has to offer! Because a 30% tip is worth it for the soft pretzel alone.    From the paintings, soap dishes, to every intrinsic detail is what makes Sip so posh and unique. We most definitely frequent the new neighborhood addition with paws and arms wide open!"}
{"text":"I visited Sip this morning with my coworkers for the grand opening and got a soy latte. It was delicious!  The space is bright, open and inviting. The patio and indoor seating would be great for accommodating larger groups, which is not often a characteristic of small coffee shops. The staff was friendly and service was quick. We'll definitely be back to try the food & cocktails!"}
{"text":"I stopped in to this awesome new restaurant to work for an hour before Yoga at Sumits and it was such a delight their version of Kevre coffee with MCT oil is delicious and very smooth the staff is welcoming & helpful. Nick the bartender neck that help to me and the best part was being able to connect to Wi-Fi with Yelp's new WIFI service!  An all around slam dunk!"}
{"text":"My favorite coffee house in Scottsdale! Live music? Check. Bomb coffee? Check. AMAZING BEER ON TAP AAAAND A BAR? Check. I come here to do work on my computer. Love the ambience and the staff is always super cool. Right now they're selling mint cold brew and it pretty much changed my life. The happy hour is amazing too, $1 off draft wine and beer and $6 whiskey mules."}
{"text":"So glad to have an authentic coffee shop walking distance from our office! Great, open floor plan with a killer atmosphere. This will definitely be my friends and my new favorite place to head to for a coffee break. Welcome to the neighborhood, Sip!"}
{"text":"If I were asked what my style is, I would say \"shabby chic\"...and I have met my spirit animal: Sip Coffee. It's vintage, mismatched, old vs. new, junk yard vs. thrift shop and I couldn't be more smitten.     I love that they have a patio to sit on when it's nice in the mornings or at night and that it is actually a decently spacious area. When you walk in, you see tables set with faux flowers, the chalkboards full of coffee and beers to try (plus cheap beer flights!) and cute frames with their menu behind the counter.        I have tried both their kale salad and their frittata and enjoyed both thoroughly. I am all for the fact that they have put chickpeas, pomegranate seeds and bacon together in their salad--it's a great flavor combo!      Yesterday when I went in, I noticed a new section with pretzel bites and wraps while I hummed a long to N*Sync. Did I mention it's eclectic and has a fun, easygoing vibe? It does. It's wonderful.      To be noted: staff is friendly but not overbearing, they do \"Dress Up Friday\" happy hour that I think is ridiculously cute and have WiFi if you want to sit and sip away the afternoon.          I love that Sip is in my neighborhood and can't wait to be a frequent customer!"}
{"text":"love it! The staff here are completely awesome, we were treated like friends and family on our first stop in. Great coffee, beautiful atmosphere; what more could anyone want in a great coffee spot. They even have a nice menu of yummies, and brew; we will be here a lot :)"}
{"text":"Perfect place to do some studying in the morning over coffee or socializing in the evening over coffee and beer."}
{"text":"Sip is my go-to coffee/out-of-the-office meeting spot. The atmosphere is fun, always busy, but I can always find a table inside or out to post up at. The patio is great when the weather is! The coffee is always delicious, and the service is great. Overall, I love Sip."}
{"text":"So much yes! Finally a coffeehouse where the environment is welcoming, the baristas are friendly, and the coffee is delicious. They host open mics Wednesday nights, making for an even more well-rounded coffeehouse vibe. I tried their cappuccino with a side of espresso for an extra kick - did not disappoint. My only regret is not discovering this place sooner. Bliss."}
{"text":"Love this place! I'm not from around the Phoenix area so we found this place on yelp and only saw good reviews. The atmosphere is great and really chill-perfect for working on a computer! The food was also great. I had the Italian sandwich and it was delicious. Great place, cool atmosphere and good food-- would definitely recommend!"}
{"text":"This is such a great spot in Scottsdale.  I love the idea of serving coffee in the morning and beer when it's five o'clock somewhere.  We came in for a light breakfast and were planning on coffee; however, we were feeling a bit dehydrated from the night before and went with the peach iced tea.  It was perfect and definitely hit the spot.  I also love how they have a huge jug of ice water sitting out to enjoy.  That was pretty perfect after I finished my tea.  The hubby and I both ordered the breakfast sandwich and shared a blueberry muffin.  The muffin was delicious and the sandwich was pretty good as well.  My only complaint is that service was a bit slow.  It took quite awhile for our sandwiches to get to us, but overall this is a great place. Check it out!"}
{"text":"Sip is a great spot! Coffee shop vibe with the option of beer!! Can't go wrong with that!"}
{"text":"Impressed with the coffee and space, not impressed with  a customer service experience. I frequent this place on occasion and earlier this week I had forgotten my charger plugged in to a power strip near the entrance of the coffee shop. Realizing at 9:30 PM that it was missing I called but no answer as they had closed. The next morning I called and spoke to Jessie, who refused to walk over to the table that I was sitting at in order to check and see if my charger was still there. He said\" there's people sitting there and I am not about to interrupt them but feel free to come in and look for yourself\". I thought he was joking, but he wasn't. So I did, drove 20 minutes just to see that my charger wasn't there, at no fault of the coffee shop but a very inconvenient scenario could've been handled with a little bit of effort on Jesse's part. Hopefully the owners are reading this and will have a little talk with him about customer service. I'll still go to this place because it's a nice working environment, coffee is good and the rest the staff has always been on top of it."}
{"text":"Lots of craft and hard to find beers, tap and cans. We tried a bunch while we listened to a nice couple perform a variety of songs. Sorry I forgot their name or I would give them props. The staff was really friendly and helped me choose some new beers to try, which I did. And they were stronger than I usually choose, so the music started sounding even better and suddenly I was having an even more super time with my friends. Décor is \"garage-like\" lots of metal and cement, lots of light and patio on the side. They have great breakfast menu. Its a beer/coffee bar so I will be back for the coffee to bring me back to life after too much of the strong beer that I tried. We had a good time. I am not going to fault Sips, but to people with infants, don't bring them to bars during happy hour when a band is playing. Even better, don't bring them to bars, period. Red Robin better choice, maybe even Chili's..."}
{"text":"I actually came here after having a bad drink at Cartel and needed a coffee fix. The ironic thing is that Sip serves Cartel beans! Luckily, I wasn't disappointed. The building itself is cute, rustic, and a bit on the hip side. There is plenty of seating inside and it feels open and spacious. The décor is fun and I love their sliding barn door. (I want one in my house.) I visited on a Saturday morning and while the place wasn't too busy (maybe three tables full) the parking lot was full. That is the one major downside - not enough parking spaces. The other downside was that the service was slow. I came in for a quick drink to-go but it took well over 15 minutes to get my drink. The barista was perfecting a latte before mine and then the process of making my drink (a hot vanilla latte) took at least 10 minutes. Believe me, I watched him the entire time. The drink was delicious and I do appreciate the art of coffee making, but I just felt it could have been a little... quicker. Fortunately, there was a guitarist inside playing tunes and that added to the ambiance. Overall, it was a good experience and if I'm in the neighborhood, I'd definitely come back. This place does more than coffee and I'd like to try their food menu."}
{"text":"Great place! Loved how open it was. The iced latte was amazing."}
{"text":"Fantastic place that reminds me of Austin, Texas, in terms of décor, music, and layout.  Great coffee and beer.  Probably the coolest coffee house in Scottsdale."}
{"text":"Super cute place for coffee or beer. Perfect for casual work meetings or working on your laptop. Check it out!"}
{"text":"Great service and food alike! Coffee is so fresh and the service is super polite and helpful! Yay for good food and coffee! The atmosphere is really laid back. I find it easy to work or catch up with friends here. I'll be back soon!"}
{"text":"Always friendly staff and amazing coffee. My favorite is when they have a live musician playing tunes! The patio is dog friendly too :)"}
{"text":"I came here for a quick coffee and bite to eat on a Monday morning. I liked that there was plenty of seating and lots of windows, making it sunny and welcoming. I really wanted to try their breakfast sandwiches and was very disappointed that they were out of both everything bagels and pesto. I settled with an iced coffee and a bacon, egg and cheese with greens and aioli instead. The coffee was pretty standard, nothing to write home about. The bagel sandwich was a sloppy wet mess. It was impossible to eat because it did not stay together. The aioli had much too strong of a sweet lemon flavor, which did not complement the contents of the sandwich at all. I ended up cutting it all up and eating it like a bagel salad, but I still could only finish about 30% of it. Hopefully their pesto dishes are better when they can keep it in stock!"}
{"text":"Swear I've been coming for years here , everything about this place is amazing. The people that come in are super friendly and I think the general good energy this place gives off are what keeps people wanting more. You want great coffees, teas, and some seriously amazing drinks on top of an extensive list of Craft beers this is your place. Now don't even get me started on how amazing the food is btw What attracts a lot of people are two things the cute niche feeling and the fact that everyone from every background collects there and it's beautiful."}
{"text":"It has taken me THREE YEARS to find a coffee place similar to my old haunt in Raleigh.  Yeah yeah, there is Coffee Bean and Starbucks,  but no character.    I used to have a local, laid back joint with fresh, non mass produced coffee, fresh food, and a quirky vibe. The icing on the cake was the alcohol  served as well. I'd finish my work and reward  myself  after.   Alas, this place has all that. Finally!!  With both indoor and outdoor  seating, TONS OF SOCKETS to plug into, friendly staff,  great food and coffee...this is my new work spot."}
{"text":"Spent the day working here and had brunch as well. This place is awesome - loved the vibe and location (which is just around the corner from our place). They play great music and have all day brewed coffee. Some nice menu options to graze on throughout the day and a nice range of beers available. We walk by Sip every time we do our night walking and have always wanted to stop in - this time we did, took our laptops and just like most who were that day, spent a lot of time working.. Will definitely be back for their open mic nights sometime soon.."}
{"text":"After my bad experience at another local south Scottsdale coffee shop many months ago, I had to find a new place to study. Sip had just opened, so I gave it a shot. So glad I did! The atmosphere is trendy but comfortable, and I love that their menu includes coffee, tea, wine, or beer. Plus the menu goes beyond standard coffee shop fare. The bruschetta hits the snack-spot every time!  I need to say, though, that this would be a 4.5 star review if that were an option. It is a bit pricey, but should be expected because of the area. Also, the sandwiches can be hit or miss... Had one that was alright and one that was too terrible to eat.   Let's go back to thinking about the bruschetta."}
{"text":"I am in love with this new spot in Old Town! The staff is so friendly and helpful, the beer list top notch, and the snacks are great! I have yet to try a coffee but they look amazing! Bring your pup, and enjoy their cozy patio, or bring your computer and hang in the eclectic indoor seating area!"}
{"text":"We love Sip! It's super cute, has great coffee drinks, beer and cocktails. Not to mention they have a dog friendly patio. What more could a girl ask for.  I'd give them 5 Stars but have yet to be impressed with the food. We've only tried a couple sandwiches and they were small and nothing special for the price. We still frequent Sip for an afternoon drink and atmosphere."}
{"text":"In a way I feel like I should wait before reviewing this place. I stopped in here at about 10:30 on a Friday night, which is right before Sip closes (they technically close at 11, but they stayed open a good 20-30 minutes past that when I was here), but everything was so awesome in that short amount of time that I'm gonna go ahead and give them five stars!  I've been wanting to stop in here for awhile, and too be honest, I've mostly wanted to stop in the morning or afternoon for a coffee and/or food (and I'll be doing that at some point!), but the opportunity presented itself randomly on a Friday night so I stopped in for a couple beers.  I loved the atmosphere. There's lots of space (both indoors & a patio), with comfortable chairs and couches. The staff is extremely friendly & outgoing. Since it was near the end of the night there were only a couple people working, but the guy working behind the bar (I believe his name was Alex...for as much as we talked to him I really should remember) was very outgoing. He seemed to know a lot about both the beers on tap & bottled beers & made my friend I was w/his own whiskey concoction, which she really liked. Speaking of whiskey, I was actually surprised this place even served liquor (I believe they only have whiskey). I just assumed they were beer & wine, but apparently they're not.   Like I said, I really need to try some other things here to get more of a feel for this place, but I really liked what I saw & tasted in the short amount of time I stopped in for.   One last thing I should point out that I really like about this place is the hours. I actually LIKE that they close early (compared to bars). They attract a different crowd because of it, and if you're only looking to have a couple drinks it's a good place to start the night or just catch up with friends for a bit."}
{"text":"Not sure if it is good or not. Went to try it out at 9:30 pm on a Saturday and they were turning the lights out as we walked up to the door (website and sign on door says they are open until 11 pm on Saturday's).  Employees just staring at us through the window.  2 other cars pulled up as we were walking back to our car and they were not happy either.  I suggest they fix the hours posted or at least put a sign on the door if there was some reason that they closed early."}
{"text":"Being from Seattle and on the prowl for good coffee I walked past two Starbucks to get here from my hotel... well worth the walk and the sun was great for my pasty Seattle skin... this place rocks!! Great coffee, great service, and an amazing atmosphere and vibe going on. I can't wait to visit Scottsdale again and come back in...."}
{"text":"Definitely one of the better coffee joints I've been to in the Valley. I had an hour before an appointment, so I stopped in here and had a small cold brew coffee. It had wonderful flavor! I'd definitely get it again.   The decor inside is very unique, creative, and inviting. My favorite part was the old Jamison bottle that is now a soap pump!   There's plenty of seating, both inside and outside. I saw several business meetings  in-progress and several college-age students with laptops. Must be a popular place to do work!   If I am in Scottsdale again soon, I'll definitely stop back by for another cold brew."}
{"text":"Surprised by the breakfast menu in a good way!  The breakfast sandwich was sooooo good! Scrambled eggs seem fresh and just made. The everything bagel was soft somehow, not like any bagel shop I've been to. And there's fresh arugula on the sandwich. I forgot how much I like arugula! And what can I say about the fritata with bacon and a sauce that's spicy and perfect. I'll just quote my picky wife, \"oh..! This is the best fritata I've ever had!\""}
{"text":"Great place with a dog friendly patio. They use mostly local food and beer. Keep up the great work Travis."}
{"text":"Super welcoming little coffeehouse. Good place to meet with friends to catch up or work on a project. I like to go there on the weekends to do homework and end the night with a beer. Perfect balance! Haven't tried the food yet but menu looks great"}
{"text":"Beer and Coffee. It doesn't get much better than that. I really dig the atmosphere of this place. A really cozy joint located right off the major road. The barista was very knowledgable and gave several recommendations based off of what I was craving. Also, they make a cold brew which they keg. Never have experienced that so it was really cool to try!"}
{"text":"I've never been one to really frequent coffee shops as I just became a coffee drinker but I drive by this place pretty frequently and it always looks intriguing. I just met a new friend through Bible study and we decided to get coffee to get to know each other more. Her sister suggested this place and I wasn't let down. It is the perfect place to sit down and socialize with friends while enjoying live acoustic music. I also noticed 90% of the people there had laptops and were either working or studying. The great thing is they aren't your typical coffee joint as they have the live music, a small but appealing food menu, and a good selection of craft beer. I didn't try any food so I can't speak for that but my iced vanilla latte was great!"}
{"text":"Sip is a wonderful oasis from the strip mall dominated Phoenix/Scottsdale norm. Their repurposed knitting shop is fun to be in, open & airy, full of fun decor, and has a great shaded patio. Their coffee is great, baristas know what they are doing, beer selection is stellar, ambient music always fresh, and the live weekly music is a great getaway."}
{"text":"I would go here again just for the environment! Everywhere you look, your eye catches something fun to look at. The service was excellent and they were very knowledgable with their products. Even with a simple americano, the flavors were superb and fresh tasting. I will visit here again soon!"}
{"text":"Plenty of room here to either enjoy some fresh air outside, hang out on the couches with friends, plug in and work on a device using the free wifi, or have an intimate coffee date with a special someone. Also, there is plenty of parking, accessible from either Scottsdale or Goldwater.  Awesome music playing in the background, and this time of year, they have festive decorations and a tree in the corner. Loved the sign to the bathroom \"the loo.\" Is this a Brit place?  I sipped a caramel nonfat latte in a red ceramic cup, which tasted great. Gained some energy for shopping later. Definitely a place to sip something and hang out."}
{"text":"Sip is, quite literally, my favorite place outside of my home. Scratch that, sometimes I'd rather be at Sip! Here's why:  Kick ass staff-everyone that works here is super friendly. Alex has a magnificent beard. The owner is often on site, and he's super hipster and nice too! Not only do they know your name, they know your dog's name! Which brings us to reason #2.   Dog friendly-really, really dig friendly. Equal or more so than OHSO. They have water bowls on the patio, and the staff regularity comes out to play with your pups.   Ambiance-totally hipster in the best possible way. Mismatched thrift store furniture. I think the owner and his wife actually made the tables by hand. Lounge chairs are incredibly comfortable and placed around a coffee table, with end tables in between. This arrangement makes it the perfect place to park your tush for an afternoon of reading, or for a couple (or a couple of friends) to sit casually and talk. You often end up siting next to strangers, and it's never weird. I've struck up some amazing conversations with way!  Food-let's start with What the Buck Wednesday, where tamales are a buck and a buck off beer. Yes, you read that right. TAMALES! Better yet, they have vegetarian tamales and they are delicious. They have salads, breakfast sandwiches, bagels, pastries, and sandwiches (also with a veggie humus sand which, which you can order sans cheese for a yummy vegan option).   Coffee-Cartel coffee beans. Almond milk options. They know what they're doing over here.   Beer-they have a great selection of beer on tap, which they rotate regularly. I'm personally a porter/stout kind of girl, and only once have they not had one on tap. They even had pumpkin porter on tap in April! They also do mixed drinks and mimosa bar on Sundays.   Live music-pretty often. They have open mic nights as well. The music is usually acoustic and is one, at most, two person artists.   Yoga-during fall, winter, and early spring they do free yoga outside on Sundays at 9:00, partnered with Lulu Lemon. I'm a fan. It's beautiful and peaceful, then you can walk in and eat and drink.   See why it's my favorite place on earth?!"}
{"text":"Cool spot. They play good vibe music at an appropriate volume. can get some work done in here. good place to post up like a mailbox and read   great soft pretzel. comes out hot and fresh. wasn't feeling their mustard tho. it was all horseradish. should've have opted for the cheese sauce. next time."}
{"text":"Sip Coffee & Beer House is what all coffee houses should or meet up too. It's a place to study, eat and chill. Meet up with friends for some local brewed coffee or sip on a local craft beer. It's as good as it gets, interior and exterior is always wonderful I love the aesthetic of the place. Not so hidden, but it kind of is in the beginning of heading towards south scottsdale / old town scottsdale. You pay for what it is because taxes are already included. Haven't tried any items from the food menu, but drinks are wonderful and the service is pretty great from what I seen, I went on a Sunday and it was pretty packed with people doing work, hanging out and meeting up with friends, so it's a well known place. Definitley will be coming back!"}
{"text":"The coffee here is very good & they offer unique beers as well. A person can order a flight in glasses served in a muffin baking tin... So fun! Good wine too!"}
{"text":"This is my favorite coffee place to hang out and grab some coffee. The staff is cool and very friendly, the coffee is fantastically brewed, and the atmosphere is very laid back and cozy. I appreciate the fact that I can get both coffee and beer, although I've only gone in on the coffee. From what I've seen, they do have a great beer selection though. In regards to the food, they do sell a great breakfast burrito....I'd recommend it. On some Sundays, they also have a local talent performing, and he is great (I'm blanking on his name at the moment...). Now, there is one very small detail that is a slight downside, the amount of parking spaces allocated for Sip is small, so carpool with a friend or you'll have to park around the corner.  Anyways, if you're looking for a cool place to get together with people, head to Sip - you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Loved the vibe of this place and their coffee was excellent. Skip the mega-chains and patronize this place while visiting Scottsdale. We avoided the auto-pilot urge to go to SBux and went here during our visit. Much happier and relaxing visit. Great bagel breakfast sandwich and a solid (although dry) chorizo bkfast burrito."}
{"text":"I have lived in the capital of coffee(seattle), I'm a huge foodie, this place is a hidden gem for scottsdale, coffee is some of the best far better than anything I have had in the phx adea, the atmosphere is amazing, will be returning for more on the menu"}
{"text":"(Mostly) Polite and courteous staff. Quality product. Cool ambiance. Only issue is it gets a bit loud."}
{"text":"Live music and open mic night Wednesday night and happy hour from 4-7 pm everyday.   Bells beers (the best beer) on tap! Oberon in a can! Best day ever!!   For breakfast I love the cinnamon coffee cake and coffees. They also have almond milk which is always a plus. Live music on Saturday also!!"}
{"text":"I like coming here for a latte.   Always consistently great. I like the nutty flavor. I think it's better than Starbucks.   The only thing I don't like about this place is the douchy hipsters that hang out here. Go to a bar or dance club and pick up chicks, why are you hanging out at the coffee shop?  Sometimes they have live music but it's not my thing."}
{"text":"This place is pretty cute for studying, but my boyfriend & I were both not very impressed with their food & drinks. I ordered the grilled cheese w/ bacon and it was super dry and just not good. The drinks (coffee & prickly pear iced tea) were okay, service was also good, and I would definitely return just not for food."}
{"text":"I loved. The coffee, the place itself, the music, the seats, the staff, the bathroom everything was really good. I loved the place and I will definitely go back."}
{"text":"This is my favorite coffee shop in Scottsdale! Great anytime of the day. Coffee, beers and iced teas; you can't go wrong with any of it."}
{"text":"First time going there today. Chances of me giving it another try are 50/50. Let's start with the positives: -cool atmosphere. It's open and airy with different table and chairs, couches, and outdoor patio space with misters. -great chai tea lattes  -great breakfast sandwich that had egg, bacon, arugula, creamy cheese, and a tomato type jam on it.   Now here are the negatives that are swaying me to not give this place another shot.  -customer service was pretty sub par. I ordered the breakfast sandwich and asked to have avocado added to it. Avocado was on other items on their menu, so didn't think it would be a problem to have it added. I was fine with paying any up-charge. When the server brought the sandwich to my table he verbatim told me \"The owner wanted me to tell you that for future reference, Avocado isn't an option that can be added on the breakfast sandwich but we added it just this time\". Well jeez thanks for the telephone relayed message but I already paid the extra $2 for it and it wasn't like I was asking for something completely outrageous like foie gras to be added. You had the avocado already, it takes 30 seconds max to slice, and I am paying you the up-charge price of basically the cost of 2 avocados for a few slices.... -their iPad check out kiosk tipping buttons are tacky. I have been in the restaurant business. I understand tips are important but to have remarks like \"15% uhhh\" \"20% thanks\" \"30% we are buying you a beer!\" Is just not called for. Especially at a coffee place where they are screaming your name to pick up your latte when the place is 80% empty and give you a lecture on avocado."}
{"text":"Well, the chicken salad was an shining example of the overuse of tarragon without a complimentary taste to back it up and support. The green tea was excellent, though after hearing they used to loose leaf it, i was disappointing not to get it served that way or offered as an option. The coffee was good and makes for a better place to go to than the other coffee places in the area. Beautiful patio!"}
{"text":"Perfect place to sit and work . Love the outside patio . Very relaxed environment. Also love the tinkle lights at night"}
{"text":"I've tried the Kevlar (Bulletproof) coffee at both locations and they don't make it correctly. The coffee tastes burnt, not enough butter, and it's not blended enough. This is easily fixable."}
{"text":"Decor looks like it's trying too hard to be hipster. The coffee was decent. I had a cappuccino and the foam just wasn't done right. But disregarding that, the coffee is nice and nutty with an almost sweet after taste. Price-wise it is closer to what one would get in SF. Ie, pricey for this part of the country."}
{"text":"My first time here. I have been hearing about Sip and their pastries for a year or so and just hadn't made time to come (actually, I did try once and there wasnt anywhere to park so I kept driving).  Today (a Saturday morning), a friend and I came for coffee and a pastry for a light breakfast. I was instantly taken with the atmosphere. I love vintage! Most everything there is from long ago and kept looking that way. Lots of wood and metal. I also love the choice of indoor and outdoor seating as well as an open wall window (if weather permits) bar seating that looks out onto a tree lined area of Scottsdale road. There isn't much of a menu, which is fine. It's  beer, coffee, \"sammies\", and pastries. I was rather disappointed at the offering of pastries as they were not what I was expecting. I thought they were handmade by a local baker I had met a year ago, but what was presented was smaller, less appealing and packaged in cellophane. So, I ordered a drip coffee and breakfast sammie instead (prices were reasonable, about $10). I was able to order the bagel sandwich how I wanted.  Service was good and friendly at the register and our coffee was given to us there. It took a while to get our sandwiches and they came out at different times but, tasted good.  There is a lot of table space to meet friends and visit or sit with your laptop. There are also many areas/choices on where to sit. I also noticed signage for an open Mic night if you're interested in that. Overall, we had a good experience and would go back."}
{"text":"Atmosphere cool vibe.  Food not at all worth price. And service was uppity. And Don't order bruschetta     Happy hour not really that great either and do not come one minute late or will not receive the big (sarcasm) $1 off.    Love the comfortable couch and good wifi!!!"}
{"text":"Great food, nice ambiance, friendly staff, tasty coffee and urban brews! A stellar place to study during the day!"}
{"text":"I stop in about once or twice a week. It a stop in the afternoon before an evening event usually. The place is usually hoping with a variety of folks, most engaged in what look like meet ups with collaborators, clients or friends. The music is always upbeat.   I usually get a tea, they brew the teas on the spot. It takes a few minutes but well worth the wait. You can order salty or sweet snacks if that's what you are looking for. The staff is always ready with a friendly welcome, and bring your beverages to the eclectic variety of tables and chairs. There is even a sofa to relax in.   There is a large selection of beers on tap for that that want something stronger. From what I can tell by other's reaction its always tasty.    There is a little meeting room of sorts in the back corner, I've seen at least eight or so people fit there is that is something you are looking for."}
{"text":"This place has a cozy and warm ambiance whether you are here to study, meet up with friends, eat and/or grab a drink. I had a delicious veggie hummus sandwich for lunch. My husband had two of their beers which he really liked and I enjoyed their chai latte with almond milk."}
{"text":"This is an interesting new place in old town Scottsdale.  A place where you can grab a coffee and read a book, meet with friends, or catch up on work.  Also a place where you can sit on the patio and enjoy a beer after work or coffee cocktails in the evening.  The beer selection is good but I felt that the coffee choices were a bit limited.  I didn't try any of the food but what everyone else ordered looked amazing and judging from the mmmmms and other praises it tasted just as amazing."}
{"text":"This is my new favorite spot!!! I love everything, from the coffee to the decor and laid back vibe. The guys that run it are pretty friendly too and they sell beer too!"}
{"text":"This is a wonderful place to relax and enjoy the weather. The Bohemian vibe attracts all ages. Great meeting spot for friends or a casual date."}
{"text":"This place is awesome! Great food and coffee (I bet the beer's good too), great atmosphere, nice decor, good music playing. I'm lucky I stumbled upon it while visiting Scottsdale. If I lived here I'd be here everyday! And thanks for your vegan food options- you made this hungry traveling vegan very happy!! :-)"}
{"text":"Sip has great Coffee!! If your looking for good coffee, place to stay and do some work, people watch, listen to some 90's tunes, this is the place! Great for groups, indoor and outdoor (pet friendly) seating. Parking can be tight however. Their cookies and brownies are like 3 lbs! and i'm not kidding. GET IT."}
{"text":"Sip is one of those so good places that you almost don't want to review because its already hard enough to find a parking spot in the tiny lot!  (By the way thats the only negative).  I haven't had the food but the coffee is beyond wonderful.  My favorite is the cold brew iced coffee with carmel and almond milk. The atmosphere is wonderful, cool art and laid back vibes.   They have plenty of seating both indoor and outdoor.  The staff is also very friendly and fun.  If you have any questions just ask them!!  One thing I must say is they seem to be hiring new staff and  some employees (baristas?) really rise above the rest."}
{"text":"Coffee shops are notorious hipster hangouts, but I don't need to tell you that. This is more basic than Starbucks, and should be obvious to even the most amateur hipster watchers. But Sip is home to something so special and unique that it is drawing hipster watchers in from all around the Southwest: the elusive \"South Scottsdale Hipster Bro.\"  While the South Scottsdale Hipster Bro hasn't been officially classified yet in the Before it Was Cool Hipster Almanac, rumors have it that peer review is pending and will likely be complete within the year. An official designation will probably be a boon for business, as it will likely draw even more hipster watchers from farther afield. Sip already has a reputation among Hipster watchers, with the largest documented population of this unique endemic varietal of hipster in the lower 48. At nearly any given moment at least one or two hipster bros will be present - a treat since most Hipster Bro sightings in the wild occur with only a single specimen. Visiting hipster watchers will find this group viewing a treat, as Hipster Bros only produce their unique vocalizations within close vicinity of another Hipster Bro.  What it is about Sip that acts as a draw for Hispter Bros is yet unknown. The decor may be a factor. It is hypothesized that the shabbychic furniture reminds the Hipster Bro of his old frat house, providing him with both comfort and a sense of home, while the vibrant colors and excellent spacing appeal to his sensitive, artistic soul. The mismatched plastic cups may remind him of the cheap plastic cups he still occasionally plays beer pong with, and they also help him hydrate so he can later hit the gym to work off those coffee calories. And while the decor may be partially responsible for the influx of Hipster Bros, Sip's draft selection is also a magnet for HBs looking to smash a few craft brewskies with his bros. Like sugar water to a hummingbird, Sip attracts Hipster Bros with the opportunity to swap beard grooming techniques, order mocchiatos the way their made in Italy, and hit on some fly-ass honies. Clearly they find the combination of all these elements irresistible, and the result is a stunning concentration of the South Scottsdale Hipster Bro.  Come enjoy this off-the-map Hipster watching mecca before the word gets out it gets ruined by the crowds. You'll be delighted to see bro hugs between men with beards and skinny jeans, and nothing beats the thrill of hearing a craft IPA-drinking Hipster Bro talk about taking his vintage 1978 Schwinn over to a girl's house and totally banging her even though she was a 6.  You'll love it if: you want to see the South Scottsdale Hipster Bro in an unspoiled setting You'll hate it if: you have a phobia of beards and displays of overt, aggressive masculinity"}
{"text":"The pros:  There's live music sometimes and the location is great. I like that it has its own parking lot. Parking could get annoying in Scottsdale.   The cons:  If you're into wine, red or white. There are only 2 options. The red is a grenache blend. Not sure about the white. The pretzel was bland and somewhat hard. The cheese dip was okay. The prices are comparable to most other restaurants and I'm not sure the quality is comparable.    I was excited when this place opened because I thought, great something like Lux in CenPho, a coffee house that serves wine. Lux is def bigger. I guess it is nice sometimes to get away from the crowd and be somewhere not so packed. Def a good place to hang out or meet for a quick \"get to know you\" date. You know, where you don't want to invest in dinner but you want to have a glass of wine and your date doesn't drink."}
{"text":"We decided to stop by for a drink after dinner since our friend recommended this place. It was decorated like something out of a dreamy Pinterest board.  PROS: Great live music Tasty coffee Cute decorations Patio seating  CONS: Service was very underwhelming - she didn't say hi to us and just waited for us to order. My mangorito wasn't spectacular, it was cheap but didn't taste like anything  We didn't try any of the food since we just came for dinner. Maybe next time, we 'll stop in for a few bites. We noticed people on the patio playing board games but we were just enjoying the great weather and people watching,"}
{"text":"This place is great for work or to have a casual business meeting. Great staff and great atmosphere."}
{"text":"YAY to the local business movement!  So glad we checked in here instead of the mega java conglomerate across the street.  Super friendly guys, nice patio, love that they're dog friendly.  I personally am not a super huge coffee fan (love the smell, not crazy about the taste), but I give them 2 thumbs up for their wonderfully friendly service.  Will go back next time I'm in the area."}
{"text":"Not bad, first barista was completely rude and gave me a horrible drink. Skinny guy with dark hair. He hardly even looked at me while taking my order. I was so disappointed. After only taking one sip I took my drink up to the front because I wasn't rude enough to dump a full drink in their small trash cans. Another barista helped me out and gave me a MUCH better drink and was so kind. Tasted way better afterwards. He was like a blondish guy with a beard, very nice and helped me with my horrible beverage. Idk if I'd come back, the Arcadia location is better but it's not bad."}
{"text":"Visited this place for the first time couple days ago with my friends. I love the design and coffee was really tasty!! Will come back again!!!"}
{"text":"Service is less than adequate. Food comes out in stages. Get ready to serve yourself. Waitress is horrible.    Although, music  by J. Strickland was great. Not only does he sing but he serves our country in the military !!"}
{"text":"Cool, unique, trendy place. Live music was great on a Thursday night. Low Hanging Fruit drink was very good! Would definitely go back if I lived here!"}
{"text":"Great atmosphere, friendly staff and best vanilla latte and iced dirty chai you'll find in town. I also really love their breakfast sandwich with bacon, delicious and you get what you pay for! Nice live music on weekends too :)"}
{"text":"Hippe vobe in this kitchy spot. Good bfast sammies, strait up coffee. Make it a regular spot."}
{"text":"If you're in Scottsdale for a day, you need to hit this spot for breakfast! The breakfast sandwich is TO DIE FOR and the atmosphere is gently hipster. I love it."}
{"text":"Awesome. Awesome. Awesome. Came in, ordered an orange juice and say at the window to work. It was next to the speaker - one of the only seats open. Was a little loud and I was thinking I wouldn't be able to focus with it loud in my ear. But the music they played was great and lively but not distracting. Later I ordered the BLT with a side salad. Omg. So good. Haven't tried the coffee yet. But the atmospheres great. Wifi is good, plug ins for power, and the service is good. Will be back."}
{"text":"Second time here and it's fantastic. Perfect place for a more low key Friday night as the staff is super sweet, it's not crazy busy and there's great live music.  Making this a weekly stop for sure"}
{"text":"I went to Sip today for a work meeting and it was SO good!! The outdoor patio was so nice and perfect for some coffee and work!  I ordered the Pesto Breakfast Sandwich-it was to die for!  The everything bagel was the best part:)  This place was awesome and I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"The only reason I don't give Sip 5 stars is that the parking lot is so small that sometimes you have to park across the street and walk, which is a bummer. But other than that, this place is great!! The staff is really wonderful and friendly. I love how there are many different types of seating arrangements, some good for meetings, others for working on your computer, and others for just hanging with friends. They have great cold brew and a fantastic beer selection."}
{"text":"Love this place!  Sip is one of those places that is always filled (and often packed) with people studying, working, congregating, reading, meeting, or otherwise doing the things that people do in coffee shops.    When I first came here, I didn't realize that their food menu was so extensive.  The drinks are truly fantastic... and like it's sister location in Arcadia, large espresso drinks are quads, which means four shots of espresso!  That makes the caffeine-addict in me quite happy, since I almost always order my drinks that way anyway... so no upcharge to do that here!  I most often opt for the cafe mocha latte... and it is perfect.  EVERY TIME.  Consistency is not overrated... and is actually the biggest factor that separates the successful restaurants from the not-so-successful restaurants.    On my sixth or seventh visit, I realized coffee alone was not going to get me through a focused work session, so I ordered some food.... the breakfast sandwich with bacon to be exact.  Let's just stop right there and reflect for a minute.  I had been here some a half dozen times or so and had never ordered this incredibly incredible sandwich before... WHY OH WHY?!?  It is SO GOOD!  I had wasted six or seven days of my life by not eating this amazing sandwich before this visit.    If you have not yet been to a Sip location, then get over there and enjoy this local staple of the Phoenix area today!  *****FIVE STARS*****"}
{"text":"Great coffee shop!! Altogether really great atmosphere to hang out or work from. Coffee is real good and they have great beer! Worked out of there for 3 days straight."}
{"text":"This place is beyond cute... the decor is spot on with the mix of vintage pieces, mismatched furniture, and 'hipster' -y decor. I only had a latte here, but it was a good coffee. They use Cartel, but they do a good job foaming the milk to the point where it is very rich and creamy. I would come back for coffee. They also have many beers available (very nice), so I would like to come back to try that. It might not be the best place to hang out and get work done as it is very loud, but it would be a fun place to hang out at with friends. Check this place out!  PS Love the bathrooms - chalkboard walls FTW! PPS Pulling in to the lot of this place is a little difficult if you're coming from the south and don't know where it is.... it is right at the point where Scottsdale diverts into Scottsdale and Goldwater.... you can turn in from either street, but Goldwater would probably be easier (since it's on the right then)."}
{"text":"Beer and coffee together, how could it be better than this? Whenever I travel, I always look for independent coffee places/local brew type establishments. This was two for the price of one. Very cool decor, comfortable, staff is ridiculously friendly, but not in an overbearing way at all.   They work with Cartel Coffee, which I had earlier in the day in downtown Phoenix and I can attest to the fact that it's really good stuff, even for the coffee snobs among us.  I chose from the fairly extensive beer menu and really combined the coffee and beer idea with Cartel's coffee stout (not sure that's the exact name, but you get the point). It was a perfect way to spend a late afternoon in Scottsdale... and it's nicely tucked away from the craziness of Old Town Scottsdale.   I can't wait to come back."}
{"text":"Get the Cold Brew Get the Cold Brew it's the best. Best little indie Coffee shop since Jamaican Blue. They have live music too on certain days"}
{"text":"No. This is not how it works. Being modern/hip style including great live music experince with poor menu with not great tastes combine with poor hospitality is not the way how it should be. Good looking place, but missing sincerity."}
{"text":"Already planning another visit here. Love this spot. Super friendly and helpful staff, comfortable, well done decor, amazing selection of coffee, craft beer, cocktails, pastries AND food. We were overwhelmed with options so this is most definitely a place you need to return to again and again. The patio is lovely and it looks right out onto Scottsdale and Goldwater.  They will be hosting morning yoga here soon. Try the Kevlar coffee. It's fantastic. Oh - and the Bavarian soft pretzel - delicious. OH! crumb cake - amazing! Vanilla latte - best around. Please check this place out and spread the word."}
{"text":"Great place to grab a coffee or beer, or both... And/Or a snack. Breakfast is great. I love the idea of all the happy themed activities (open mic night, rock and bingo) but have yet to check them out. The morning/afternoon coffee vibe is relaxing and mellow. Not sure how it is in the evenings, but can't wait to check it out. Overall, this place has a similar atmosphere to the original orange table, which I really liked before it changed owners. I realize you have to pay more for local, but the only thing keeping me from going with five stars for SIP is that I think the prices are slightly inflated only because they are selling local products. I'm ok with that in general, but at some point there's a limit to how much one can reasonably charge for a fairly common item - like a bagel and cream cheese.  Check it out, it's worth a stop, and the coffee easily rivals corporate coffee across the street."}
{"text":"We stopped in for coffee & had an amazing chai tea iced coffee & some delicious avocado toast! This was so good that we are going back for more today!  It's also dog friendly which is a huge plus because we have a puppy! The service was great! Cute little hidden gem! They also sell craft beer! My husband enjoyed his Firestone!"}
{"text":"I absolutely love this place and cannot wait to go back! The atmosphere is so laid back and the style is so rustic chic without being forced. The service is wonderful, everyone is so friendly, cool and helpful! Absolutely loved it!"}
{"text":"Ordered a hot whole milk latte.  When I got it, it was only lukewarm.  I drank it anyways since it's hot out.  It was good, just not hot.  Had it been Seattle weather I would have had to send it back.  The shop is pretty nice and inviting even though it's definitely hipster Mecca.  A girl was playing her guitar and singing, made for a relaxing environment."}
{"text":"Initially, I was very excited to hear about this craft/coffee spot walking distance from my office. Unfortunately, there is very little value here. I was charged $9++ for a 7oz. pour of Modern Times Triton Project. Don't get me wrong, it's a great beer but competitive craft spots are happily charging half that. I won't be back."}
{"text":"A really great place to hang out or do work. They have local beers on tap, coffee drinks, and pastries. Everything I have had has been good there but the atmosphere is what makes this place. It very inviting yet hip or trendy. So you are comfortable but feel like you are somewhere cool. They also have bands or singers that play there at night. Its just a fun concept all around. Go check it out!"}
{"text":"Extremely cool and hip interior. Perfect for a quiet study spot or a nice drink with a friend. Quick and friendly service too!"}
{"text":"I'm in search of great places to spend the work day. I came around 10:00 and sat on the west patio. I started off with a latte. It was pretty. They have all cartel coffee, which I'm honest, doesn't mean anything to me. I'm normally a Starbucks girl. There's nice ambient music playing and lots of light chatter from other patrons. I was able to take calls and didn't feel like I was at a library. I had the Kale salad with chicken for lunch. Ask them to go easy on the dressing, or get it on the side.  It was delicious otherwise. I'll probably come back here. Super convenient location; great atmosphere; good food."}
{"text":"Great place to meet up with friends for a good cup of coffee. A little too loud inside on a weekend afternoon for working or reading though. I'm guessing this place would be even more awesome when the weather is cool. So much patio space!"}
{"text":"Scottsdale needed this place badly - or perhaps I needed this place badly since moving from Phoenix to Scottsdale! Little dose of hipster, lovely tastes for a foodie, laid back vibe, chill employees. These are the things you find all over CenPho, but a rare breed East of 68th street. I plan on spending many weekend afternoons here drinking day beers. The decor and open layout make for a very inviting atmosphere that begs for both happy hour banter and solo study time.   The menu is small and simple, but everything looks and sounds amazing. The kale salad was light and refreshing without being overly doused in dressing. I would however recommend more chickpeas as there were only about 10 in total. My hubs loved the hummus sandwich. It came with chips and slaw, and while I typically love vinegar based cabbage slaws like this, this one was average. We both indulged in the peanut butter cookies which definitely satisfied our sweet craving. I can't wait to try that cinnamon coffee cake with a big cup of coffee soon.   The beer. Whoa. What a selection! I enjoyed a Lil Sumpin' Wild on tap which never ceases to amaze my mouth. I hope they start a loyalty punch card soon or some kind of beer club, because I'd be all over that. They do have a couple of wines by the glass, so fear not - all are welcome, including canines. The patio is dog friendly, so we of course brought our pups who loved the attention. With such a terrific concept and execution overall, I have high hopes that this place will thrive and pull in a fun crowd!"}
{"text":"Cute place. Had a chai tea and I was great!  Reason it wouldn't be a 5 star: I cut knee my knee on the tables. Tables are unstable and has nails coming out of it. Needs to update them or at least get a new table if they want to keep the theme of the shop."}
{"text":"Simple and relaxed atmosphere. Coffee good..not great..breakfast was ok..the muscian with brunch was a nice touch."}
{"text":"Thoroughly enjoyed my first visit to Sip. The environment is hip and very relaxing. Didn't try the food or coffee, which I will come back to do soon but did enjoy having one of their beers on tap. Also, the staff was awesome and very welcoming. They didn't have high chairs for my little one, but offered to go get one at one of the businesses next door.  Looking forward to my next visit there"}
{"text":"I love Sip more each time I go.. which has only been twice haha. Anyway, this place is great. What more could you ask for with beer, tea, and coffee! The atmosphere is relaxed. A good mix between people working on laptops and groups just sitting and hanging out. The prices are fair as well. I plan on frequenting Sip often when I move closer in a few months."}
{"text":"Nice ambience, good drinks and drafts, and also bring in some good live music weekends. Pleased how South Scottsdale is coming of its own. Need to keep the standard high when it comes to coffee, beer, and happy hour."}
{"text":"Stellar combination of craft beer taps and coffee house offerings, with a mellow atmosphere that hits the sport for consuming from either end of the spectrum, or both together in my case.  Pretzel was moist and chewy, though the accompaniments were undersized in portion I thought.  Prices are within normal range.  Parking was minimal in the lot, but ample parking on Bishop during the daytime.   Hope they expand to a larger range of food options, even if some are low-prep options.  Just more choices in general for food are needed, I think."}
{"text":"5 star joint...nothing less. Met a group of ladies tonight to socialize, have a dragon-something beer from Tucon, and hummus.  Yum!"}
{"text":"Come on, it can't get any better! The coffee is perfect and if you want great beer also! You can start and end you day at the same place ! And they know how to make a true macchiato!!  We call their red eye coffee the special because it will get you morning started right!!"}
{"text":"First timer. Cute place. There was a musician playing today, rather loud for a small place. Might want to tune it down, having to tell orders and chat w friends is hard. Great musician though. I ordered the breakfast sandwich, not bad but not great. Slightly bland. My friend got the frittata and she thought it was slightly salty from the bacon but was okay. Ordered you quack as a cocktail, for 10 it was rather small and not as strong. Pricey for bland and small. I enjoyed atmosphere. I'll be back again, never give up after one time. Tamale was fire! So one great thing."}
{"text":"So happy my son introduced us to this place. Best of all worlds - outdoor dog-friendly patio, great coffee & tea selection, beer and pretzels from next door, and live music on a sunny afternoon. What more can you ask for? Service is friendly, and this spot just hit the spot. Great vibe."}
{"text":"Been here several times & haven't had a bad experience. Ambience is wonderful, wide variety of craft beer, & the retro furnishings make it unique! Nothing bad to say about the coffee, nor the pricing.  Dude below must be seeking vengeance on the \"Scottsdale pretender owner\" (aka, the owner). I saw him today & found no DB air radiating around him - & if he wants to chase girls into the parking lot, let him! What else is a single late 20's/early 30's man supposed to do? Colin is a hater...perhaps he was denied a job here at some point. Or maybe he just woke up on the wrong side of the bed!"}
{"text":"Awesome coffee. Really impressed with its old school feel. Kind of like a hang out. However if you want to play some old time games this will be the place to go. I hear the beer is impressive with some live music. Makes for a good time"}
{"text":"This place is legit and hip. Coffee AND beer?! Win! Live music. Good food. Great patio seating. Plus it's located in a great spot near the heart of Old Town with a small parking lot of its own. What more could you ask for?   This is a great spot to come to during the day if you need to get work done but want a cool environment to get inspired. Often in the evenings they have live music. Baristas are knowledgable and make all their coffee drinks from scratch. Food is fresh. Decent prices.   Love this spot! Nuff said."}
{"text":"I visited Sip while in town with my friends. The concept of a coffee shop and a bar is like my ultimate heaven. We came in for coffee and the guy behind the bar noticed our team bride pins we had on and offered us a round of shots! We later found out that he owns the place. Everyone is super friendly and helpful. The overall atmosphere of the place is laid back. The perfect place for a coffee date or a study session. My friend had the espresso martini and it was super strong, which is of course really good! Perfect balance of vodka and espresso. The iced macchiato and cold brew were strong and just what we needed. I wish we had a place like this back in Florida."}
{"text":"Great and easy coffee shop. The staff is kind, and the coffee is strong. Whether I get a hot or cold coffee it's always delicious. If you order a hot coffee ask for their fun cups. You're welcome!   Great patio, cozy indoor space and wonderful music."}
{"text":"I have been here a couple of times with my wife for an afternoon beer.  Its a little slice of Phoenix in Old Town Scottsdale... cool vibe, down to earth staff, amazing remodel of the original building, etc.  I wish it great success!"}
{"text":"Much smaller than anticipated, but there is ample seating, both indoor and out. I was really excited about the customer service because of the review. Definitely felt a bit timid walking into a new coffee shop, in a new area, so I was put off by the cashier acting perturbed by my presence. I mean she was pleasant to the people behind me, which I believe were her friends. Totally made me feel a bit more out of place.The guy who made my coffee was friendly. Not sure I'd come back due to my initial experience.   Air conditioning works. Free wi-fi. Good amount of outlets. Small parking lot. Unimpressive service. I won't be back."}
