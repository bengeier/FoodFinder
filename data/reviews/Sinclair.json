{"text":"I really enjoyed eating at this restaurant. The portions seemed a bit small at first, but I was nicely full by the end of the night. The food was very good and flavorful. Service was super attentive and friendly. I would definitely recommend this restaurant for a fancy night out."}
{"text":"Food is fine, but this place is vastly overpriced. Dinner is $40 per person. There were only 3 parties present, but our dinner was served really slowly. It took two hours with all of the (small, mediocre) courses, with changes of silverware and plates, etc. They try to upsell you on everything. It's very intentional."}
{"text":"The sinclair restaurant is in the St Sulpice hotel at the Vieux montreal.
It is one of those restaurants where you can go several times for brunch or lunch and never get bored. Also, it s a perfect place to organise events.
 
The decor is modern and neat. The tables are all white. The chairs are nice and comfortable. 
I do recommend the terrace when it is sunny. The greenery makes you forget that you in the heart of downtown. It is usually open during summer. 

The service is impeccable, professional and fast. I have nothing to add here.
We had grilled salmon , duck sandwich, and a burger. The presentation is very nice. The food is served on big blue plates. 
For desert, we had the chocolate mousse. 

Their orange juice is freshly squeezed. The coffee was good and their mini croissant are from Premiere Moisson. 

Overall, that place puts you in a very good mood. You will also spend a great time there."}
{"text":"Agréablement surpris! La bouffe était excellente et le service également. Les accords mets et vins proposés étaient parfaits. Nous avons adoré ma conjointe et moi!"}
{"text":"While the food is quite mediocre, the large, shady outdoor patio is beautiful---a perfect setting for a lazy weekend brunch. They have a three-course menu for $25...the dessert that comes with it is fairly abysmal but the rest isn't bad (I had mushroom arancini to start and a piece of trout with lentils as my main course). Mostly, it's just a really nice place to sit outdoors and have a bite. The service is decent. I'll probably be back at some point for a drink because the atmosphere is so chill. Only in the summer though. The indoor restaurant is plastered with not-very-good art that really detracts from the decor."}
{"text":"Awesome quiet beautiful location in the heart of old Montreal. I had a latte here which was good and I enjoyed it while sitting on their terrase.  I can't comment on their food as I didn't eat here!"}
{"text":"The outside patio was nice. The service was anemic, needed to remind waiter of few times just to get pepper, while he hung out talking to colleagues. the food was ok. There are so many other options in the area"}
{"text":"Un peu coûteux mais magnifique terrasse"}
{"text":"This is a nice restaurant but by no means the best. If they worked a little bit on the quality of some of the dishes, they would be absolutely excellent. Some of their dishes are amazing, so it is totally possible. 

My family and I stayed at this hotel so we ate breakfast here a few times. The breakfasts were pretty average. The first day I got oatmeal, which was great but oatmeal is sort of hard to mess up. My husband and father got crepes and enjoyed them but felt something was lacking. My mother got yogurt both times and it was fine; again kind of hard to mess up. The next morning I ordered a vegetable omelette. They brought me an omelette with meat which I didn't know was the case until I bit into it. I spit it right out, being a vegetarian, and they made me a new one. It was fine, but very greasy. My husband ordered eggs Benedict and what came was something that looked like eggs Benedict but had a weird white flavorless sauce. Kind of odd. 

My family ate here on Christmas Eve. There was a special menu that was made for this occasion. My husband and I each had the spicy cream of carrot soup for a starter. It was amazing! Rich in flavor, creamy, a hint of spice. My mom ordered a veggie plate and said it was nothing special. My dad ordered a meat started and just described it as odd. There was not a vegetarian option for an entree but they made me mushroom risotto with black truffle shavings on top. It was out of this world amazing. I don't know why they don't have it on the regular menu. Best dish of the night for sure, as said by everyone at the table. My husband ordered the hanger steak and said it was a bit flavorless and came with this odd parsnip mash. My parents ordered the cod with pumpkin sauce and a hazelnut sauce. The fish was SWIMMING in sauce. If the chef had just drizzled one sauce under the fish and one sauce on top, it would have completely transformed the dish. The sauce overpowered the flavor of the fish and made it a little unappetizing. 

The desserts were interesting. We shared the four choices. The chocolate ones were the favorites. The rest were a bit lacking in flavor. 

Service was pretty good; not the best. But to be fair, the place was packed for the holiday. Mostly the bar just got very backed up. Overall, if they just do a little work on the menu and dishes, I think this could be a 5 star restaurant."}
{"text":"Great dinner and desert! Very expensive if you add wine!!"}
{"text":"Christmas eve dinner...cocktails were awful...service non existent...and steaks inedible.  Some of the dishes were good (shredded skate, lamb chops) but overall disappointing.   Stopped in next night for aperitif (hard to mess that up!) and bartender was rude.  Oh well."}
{"text":"We went here for Christmas dinner. Before anyone says anything, I know. People who go out for Christmas must be hated by their families, right? Well, it may just be the other way around, first off. Anyhow....my husband and I understand it's Christmas and most people don't want to be working on that day. We get it. However, when we walked up to the host and said, \"We have reservations for 5:30,\" and he said, \"Tonight? Oh, we don't have anything available,\" when we were the ONLY people there, didn't start off well at all. When I reiterated, \"We have reservations...McCormack at 5:30. On Open Table....\" he was like, \"Oh! Well, we aren't ready. Please sit at the bar first. Have something on me.\" Huh. Okay.

So we sat at the bar. The bartender was definitely frazzled...looked like she was still cleaning up from the brunch shift. Okay. No problem. I asked if she could make an extra dirty martini. She looked at me and said, \"I'll have to go downstairs for olive juice.\" Um...okay? Again, I realize it's Christmas, so I say, \"No. I don't want to bother you. I'll just take a whiskey on the rocks. What do you have?\" She named several I'd never heard of but offered the bottle of one to sniff. Okay. We'll take two. Ridiculously smooth...Dullamore? (Not Tullamore...we know that one.) Anyhow...it was nice and then two other groups got seated while we still sat at the bar waiting. Huh. Well, I know it's a slower pace here so we were patient and finished our whiskey and then a different host sat us. 

Dinner tonight was a $50 prix fixe. Seemed decent to us. We selected appetizers and dinners. I had the foie gras...something I had heard Montreal was well known for. Ugh. It tasted like strong liverwurst. That was my fault. I should never have ordered it not sure if I'd like it. My husband had a salmon appetizer that he said was \"fishy and chewy\". Neither of us finished our appetizers, but again...probably our fault.

Salads came out...they were tiny little piles of grassy leaves with one slice of an orange, four cranberries, and a dollop of vinegar. Meh.

My husband had boeuf bourguignon..but with medallions of beef as well as pork...quite good. However, the beef had several, rather tough, chewy portions...sinewy...something one wouldn't expect from a restaurant like this. I had a risotto that was more like a bouillabaisse. It was good, but definitely needed some salt. 

Dessert was a molten chocolate cake...that came out like two little bear turds....no lie. And they tasted about as wonderful (or at least I think bear turds probably taste like this). They were flavorless, unsweetened globs of chocolate that I took one bite of and left. I NEVER leave chocolate. EVER. 

Okay....ALL of this could be tolerated because it was Christmas...no one wants to work on Christmas. I get it. The death knell came when I asked the waitress for our check. She asked, \"All on one?\" -____- Are you kidding me? We are a couple out for dinner on Christmas. Do you think this is a blind date?? Do you think that, because I'm older than my husband, we're going Dutch??? I became severely annoyed at this...but my husband said the girl was young, she doesn't know. We look at the bill. Our whiskeys \"on me\" (the host) were on our bill at $15 each. Really?? Okay. I calm down. I get it. Probably not your best servers on tonight. We pay and go to get our coats from the coat check. No one has time to look at us. (Mind you, the restaurant still has several open tables...) I counted to thirty with a $2 tip and my coat check ticket in my hand. I then put my scarf and gloves on and went to the coat rack and retrieved our coats myself. We walked out with no one batting an eye. 

Honestly? The food was okay. Not worth the $50, though. I enjoyed my entire night, even with the lackluster food, until the unwitting comment from the young server. I'm sorry, but for the price and snootiness of the place, they need to train their help better. I'd skip this and try one of the many, MANY other places right around the area for dinner. Just a few blocks up is  McDonald's open 24 hours...that might be a better choice."}
{"text":"We stopped by Sinclair for a holiday meal as they had a pre-fixe menu. We only read a few reviews and thought it couldn't be too bad... how wrong we were.

Breakdown of 2/5 rating:
-Service: Even with reservation, it took 15 minutes to seat us. When we got to the dining area, there was plenty of seating, so not sure why we had to wait. The waiters were kind of standoffish. No one was friendly or approachable. Also, they couldn't remember where we left off in the menu. We were supposed to finish off the meal with tea or coffee, but after 20 minutes of no one stopping at our table, we had to stop a server and just ask for the check.
-Food: The low rating is really because of the food. Everything was so under-seasoned, we were pretty unhappy how much we were paying for our meals. It lacked even salt. By looking at the tables around us, it wasn't just our opinion-- several tables were using salt and pepper shakers. The mashed potatoes they served with the meal tasted like powder potato with chunks of real potatoes, and also lacked seasoning.

Overall, I would not recommend Sinclair to friends/family."}
{"text":"Lovely spot on St Paul in Old Montreal.  Perfect for client entertainment.  The food is very good.  The atmosphere is elegant.  Wine list is spot-on and the wait-staff, while a bit slow are nevertheless courteous and do a fine job overall.  I work down the street and I won't be a regular, but it's nice to have in the neighbourhood.  And if you're a tourist in Old Montreal...and you're confused...go here.  You won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"The ambiance is certainly upscale but the food is insulting for the price! We went there for lunch and it was a $25 prix fixe menu. It was HORRIBLE!!! What a joke!

The appetizer was either a salad or a soup. The soup was gritty and tasted awful. The bread was also unbearable to eat. 

Next, the main dish was a rose penne. It tasted like kids food! It was also undercooked and way too chewy. After a few bites, I gave up on it and hoped dessert would be better!

Well.. there WAS NO DESSERT!! I was too annoyed to even ask why there was no dessert as on the prix fixe menu it said dessert was included.

For 1 glass of wine (tasted like vinegar) and 2 prix fixe meals plus taxes and tip, we were out $90. Yes, almost $100 for lunch for 2.

Luckily, I found a nice sandwich place down the street (VERITAS CAFE MONTREAL) and had a wonderful sandwich and salad.

RIP OFF!!! Oh, and good luck finding parking under $20."}
{"text":"Not often do I give a 2 star to a spot. Thanks to the cockiness of the servers I was forced to do so. 

Went here for a holiday party. They had an area cordoned for us. 

When asked for warm bread the waiter said no we cannot give you warm bread. Food was ok. We got the gnocci which was tasty followed by steak which wad mediocre. What irked me was the non Chalant attitude of the main server.


It seemed like he was doing is a favor. End of the day you don't treat a 75 person crew like this. 

Sinclair please fix your people problem."}
{"text":"Enjoyed dinner at this lovely restaurant last night. Apparently it is Restaurant week in Montreal and so there was a special 'local' menu last night. See my pic of the menu. Remember that the U.S.$ is roughly $1.20 and so my three course prix-fixe with wine pairings was only $60. How come we can't get treats and prices like this in the U.S. I chose the foie gras, the filet mignonette pork with wild mushrooms and the delicious chocolate dessert (with a French port). All delicious plus the service was great. Recommended!!!"}
{"text":"Located in the lobby of the Le Saint-Sulpice, the Sinclair is a restaurant and bar within this boutique hotel.  We needed a light bite to eat and decided to order off their Lounge Menu while sitting next to the large fireplace in the lobby.  My wife and ordered up a bottle of wine along with the charcuterie and cheese plates.  The presentation was great and the food even better.  A wide array of artisan cheese and meats paired very nicely with our wine.  The bartender was the one taking care of us and made sure we had anything we needed.  Overall it was a perfect small meal while relaxing by the fire."}
{"text":"Ambiance: very upscale and sophisticated with silver cutlery and white aprons and white gloves. Very romantic and beautiful interior decor. It's a great place to take that special someone on a date

However, the Service was mediocre and so was the food. I had high expectations since theyre hotel is one of the nicest ones in old port montreal.
We waited very long to get our food on the table.
I was shocked to see that my entrée was sweet and would have been easily confused with the desert menu. I got lemon meringue as an appetizer. That doesn't really make sense. They said it was the appetizer of the day. The catch of the day was dry and overcooked

Overall, it's not the best resto I've been and I was very disappointed by the service and food. i don't recommend this place but if you're on a date it's definitely very romantic and they make sure the lights are all dimmed to enjoy quality time with that special someone. I will not return but it was enjoyable."}
{"text":"We stayed at hotel and ate a few breakfasts and one dinner here.  We also used the bar.  We loved the patio.  Such a lovely place in the height of Canadian summer. They had a good selection of wines by the glass; we tried many.   The service could be a bit harried since they did not always have as many staff as were needed.  Breakfast was good. I was very happy with having this lovely place to relax if we did not feel like leaving our rooms."}
{"text":"If only I can give this place negative stars. Beautiful place, horrendous food. I went during summer for brunch and the whole menu was one false representation after another. They advertised kumquats yet they gave me chunks of orange. They said Nutella on the French toast which was probably 6 months old yet the drizzled it with nesquik. I won't go on and on cause they're not worth any other effort.  Disaster. Offensive.  What a waste."}
{"text":"Quelle déception ! 

J'étais venue au Sinclair il y a plus d 'un an et lui avais donné 4 étoiles. Le menu, le service, les saveurs et même le prix m'avaient confortés dans mon choix. J'avais trouvé cette place digne d'intérêt : déco baroque, lumière tamisée, ambiance intime, cuisine ouverte, belle carte de vins et un service discret mais très pro.

Le Sinclair a depuis changé de propriétaire et a perdu tout ce qui faisait son charme, à mon grand regret.

La carte ne propose plus de cuisine Québécoise revisitée. Le menu est classique ; la nourriture est toujours bonne, mais les prix ont tellement grimpé ! 

Le service reste très courtois mais pousse à la consommation (j'aimerais ne pas être harcelée sur mon choix de vin AVANT de regarder la carte, et qu'on n'insiste pas lorsque je fais le choix de ne PAS prendre de menu mais plutôt un plat).

Bref, sans avoir connu le Sinclair avant je ne serais pas spontanément venue dans ce restaurant. Et parce que j'y suis allée avant et que j'avais vraiment aimé, je suis désolée de ne mettre que 2 étoiles...

Il y a beaucoup d'autres belles places dans le vieux Montréal pour une note aussi élevée."}
{"text":"Très bonne table, la formule à 20$ pour le lunch est généreuse, les plats sont très bien, vraiment, j'y retournerai. Hélàs, pas vu la liste de vins. J'ai hâte de voir la terrasse sur le toit, paraît-il."}
{"text":"4 etoiles pour le service de pains + beurre et croissants au brunch ca fait du bien quand on attends les assietes. Bon service, grand local, jardin l'été, bonne bouffe."}
