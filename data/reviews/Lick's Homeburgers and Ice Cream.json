{"text":"My favorite Licks to go to! They have a great veggie burger and fries. The staff is super nice and its always clean and spacious"}
{"text":"First time going to a Licks in years since they closed the location at McCowan and 401. I wouldn't take a date here but for a decent meal with plenty space to sit down this hits the spot. Not sure if the promo is permanent but they had a 2.99 cheeseburger on their window so we got a few =) those burgers aren't massive but at that price it's a great deal. I'd come back again."}
{"text":"My cousin bet me that I could take down one of their Hulk Burgers. Well. Let's just say I won that bet. Then I bet her that I could take down an order of poutine. Won that bet too. Let's just say the burger was better than the walrus meat they serve at McDonalds. Is it the best burger in the area? No. You can walk across the street to Kelsey's or Shoeless Joe's and get a better burger but if you do want to try a 16 oz burger to say you did it or to bet someone you can, then go to Lick's."}
{"text":"I love Lick's. The one close to me has been closed for a while but it's worth driving to Toronto!! Best burgers around."}
{"text":"There was a time, long ago, when I considered the Lick's Homeburger to be THE burger of choice. Since then, the burger industry has grown tremendously, with all kinds of gourmet and designer burger joints popping up all over. The prices have also grown tremendously!

It's been many years since I've been to Lick's. I didn't even know they were still in business but the route to my new job takes me past this location so I had to check it out.

There was only one employee and four other diners when I arrived but another employee arrived just after I placed my order. Good timing. It got busy very shortly after.

I ordered the Homeburger combo with onion rings and pop, plus I added cheese. I had it dressed with lettuce, tomatoes, onions, and Guk (their house-made special sauce), just the way I used to order it. At under ten dollars, it was a bargain, compared to all the newer, trendier places.

The burger patty was a nice chunk of meat that looked hand-made but there was something about the texture that I couldn't quite put my finger on. Filler? Flavourwise, it was good, as good as I remember. The onion rings were thin and crispy but nothing outstanding about it.

I love burgers and I've found a lot of the newer burger joints overrated and overpriced. There is still a place for Lick's in the market. The burgers are still good, made and dressed to order, and are a great value."}
{"text":"I just wanted to update since I went back yesterday.

1. Still no singing. This time, at all. Sad. I miss when walking into a Lick's was like being transported back in time. Oh well...

2. The burger tasted...different. Better. Way better. There wasn't that weird spice/aftertaste that I remembered. It was too huge to eat, but I really enjoyed it. The fries were much much better than I remembered as well. They are the type of fry that NEEDS to be well-done, though. The onion rings were yummy too.

3. I went for their $1 Homeburger deal that I saw quickly as I drove past. Homeburgers for $1 from 2-5 during the week....IF you buy a large drink and a large fries...2 of these meals was almost $20. I'm afraid of seeing what the price would have been WITHOUT the deal....I should've just gotten the regular combos, but even still...they would've been around $20 as well. It's just too much."}
{"text":"When I think of fast food I'm thinking: cheap and fast as I'm sure most of us do. Frankly, this place just did not deliver. 

Pros: 
- Almost 15 diff. toppings to choose from (exotic ones like: zucchini relish and mango chutney, which btw are both great)
- Burger was big, but too big for me

Cons: 
- The interior is too colourful and childish for me
- 5 dollars for a burger?  Y'no.
- Almost a 10 min wait? (There's a Tim Hortons beside them... jus' sayin')
- Staff with attitude? (Can't really blame them... I mean it's Lick's)

Overall:  There are thousands of other fast food places in that area that I'd rather go to. Sorry LICKS! and what kind of name is Licks? -raises eyebrow-"}
{"text":"Been going to various licks for a while. This one is kinda run down.

Walked in, and the staff were not too enthusiastic. I know, that shouldn't be a criteria, but anyone else remember the days when you walk into a licks and the staff would cheer/welcome you, and even sing when making burgers? Make Licks Great Again! (lol, had too).

The burger and fries were good, nothing special, pretty standard. Grab food, eat. But probably wouldn't stay there for the atmosphere or go out of my way."}
