{"text":"Overpriced for mediocre food, slowest service on the planet. Luckily we met there so I could take the kids home while my husband waited another 20
minutes for the check. Sadly aren't a lot of restaurant choices in the area so that's what keeps them in business, but suggest making the drive elsewhere--you'll get better food and better service."}
{"text":"Don't waste your time at this place. Me and my girlfriend came here last weekend and a bartender (Mike was his name) was continually hitting on my girlfriend, right in front of me. She was extremely uncomfortable. We watched him do the same to every girl in the bar... it was repulsive. They were over serving everyone in there and the drinks we got were WAY TOO STRONG. This place is poorly managed for letting their bartenders over pour and steal money out of the OWNERS POCKET... pathetic. The food was mediocre and over priced... over $10 for a burger that tasted like a fast food joint.

Most importantly, a COP WAS SITTING IN THE PARKING LOT when we left - just waiting to give people DUIs - coupled with the over pouring and repulsive actions of the bartender, we'll never be here again. I will ensure nobody I know ever spends a penny at this place as well - do the same... there are plenty of legitimate bars and restaurants in this area that deserve your business... this isn't one of them."}
{"text":"The food was really bad.  Me and my husband ordered Ban Ban Shrimp, cheicken tender, prime rib and Calzoine.  The Ban Ban shrimp, all we can eat was thick batter, chicken tender were tasted like made from frozen. The prime rib (12oz $16.99) was overcook and the meat was not fresh. My husband ordered Calzoine and the filling was just watery. Very disappointed. :("}
{"text":"Went there with family and friends on New Year's Eve at 6:00 pm. We had 15 people in our party. The place was pretty busy so they seated us in the banquet room and there were others seated there as well. The service was excellent. We had two servers that were very attentive. Our meals came very quickly and the food was very good. The only thing missing was some good Italian bread. Never went to an Italian restaurant that did not serve bread! They were  large portions at a reasonable price. The decor needs a little attention. There was red tape along the edge of the carpets as we walked back the long hall to get to our seats. Not sure if they are remodeling or what. Overall it was a good experience. Sometimes we go there in the summer and sit on the deck and listen to live music while enjoying beer and pizza. Great place!! Would recommend it!!"}
{"text":"Pugliano's had been a staple as I was working with a customer company nearby for the better part of 2 years. Good daily specials, always fish & seafood options to chose from. Very friendly servers. But to this day, I get back to Pugliano's for their Buffalo Wings. They are the best. Meaty, hearty, rich in sauce, not too hot, chunky blue cheese sauce on the side. Granted, you can't argue about taste, but I challenge any TV-advertised big chain wings to match up against Pugliano's offer. The others are not even in the same league!"}
{"text":"I don't know about this place. I've gone there and the food has been outstanding. Seriously great food. I've also gone back and the food was awful...almost unedible.  Same with the service...seen both sides of that coin. Not to mention, I've been to the bar area when my feet would actually stick to the floor - very nasty.

Realistically, this place is bi-polar. I wish I could lean one way or another, but it's just not there.  

Fair price....nice selection...just no consistency."}
{"text":"I don't get all the negative reviews about this place.  I guess if you get a bad night of service that could do it, but I personally love Pugs. It's close by so I am there often when I want to stay local.  I've eaten here a ton of times and can't remember ever having a bad meal. The menu has a great variety, everything from salads, entrees, subs, pizza...pretty much you name it.  They offer a long list of daily specials each day that includes some different, unique options, and usually a great offering of fresh fish specials.  This is not a high end restaurant...it's a casual neighborhood place with a nice atmosphere and a menu consisting of a lot of your basics...prime rib on weekends, pastas, steaks, your typical chicken dishes, etc, but it's been consistently good in my experience. I rarely order chicken as an entree when I'm out, since it's so easy to make at home, but if I do order it, this is the only place....their chicken Romano is by far the best I've ever had.  So crispy on the outside. If you're a chicken orderer...I highly recommend it.  They offer a nice selection of apps, and people love the fried zuch.  The bar area is great, lots of bar seats and tables if you prefer.  Yes, as so many have complained about, the bar is smoking.  It does not bother me and I don't find it smokey in there.  But if bothers you the non smoking dining room is an option.  They have a nice selection of beers both on tap and bottled.  They get seasonal selections in as well.  Full menu can be ordered in the bar.  Most of the bartenders are great, except for one in my opinion.  The blonde chick that works the day shift on weekdays could be friendlier.  She's usually still there when I arrive for happy hour, and she's very non-friendly to women.  She's all nice and fine to the old man regulars that sit there all day as I'm sure she likes their tips, but guess what honey...if you're nice and friendly to me I'd tip you well also.  She's not very welcoming to those that aren't her regulars.  So, disregarding her as the one bad point of this review, I'll still give it 5 stars.  I had one bad experience with a take out order...they have a great wing selection and I ordered my usual kind, brought them home and they were so well done and over cooked I could barely eat them.  Now this was once in probably 15 times ordering them, so...well...we all have a bad night once in awhile."}
{"text":"Puglianos is my go to place. Great atmosphere with consistently good food, people are great and Gary the owner is there to please. Can't wait to go back!!!"}
{"text":"For the best case of diarrhea you'll ever have stop in you will  crap nothing but hot dog water for days"}
{"text":"Will not be returning. The quality of the food has gone down extremely but then again so has the staff. Waitresses look like they should be bar tending at a biker bar not serving food at a family restaurant. Not to mention they are always outside smoking!!!! Disgusting. Oh and the soap and paper towel dispenser in the ladies room is broken! Awesome!"}
{"text":"the service is poor ,slow and incompetent .the food is average at best .hostesses texting to few wait staff and long wait for food"}
{"text":"Had the Easter Buffet this afternoon and it was VERY good. Had reservations for 15 and we were promptly seated even tho we were 20 minutes early. Our waitress was quick to get our drinks then it was on to the food. Prime rib,ham and leg of lamb were on the carving table and all were great. Prime rib was probably the best I've had. There were four different types of pasta,baked fish,potatoes and veggies. Oh ya and a huge salad bar that I didn't even bother with but my family all said it was good as well. Definitely recommend!"}
{"text":"I have been to Pugliano's a few times.  You will get a below average meal whether you order pizza, pasta, or a sandwich.  I can understand grabbing a beer to enjoy on the deck; however don't pay to eat here.

Edited:  2 to 1 Star."}
{"text":"I came with a larger group for a birthday. They were accommodating for a large group, but I would definitely recommend putting in reservations.  The service was efficient and the staff was nice enough.  I got the chicken parmesan and it was a huge portion for me.  The sauce was just ok and I have definitely had better.  I most likely would not choose to go to the restaurant again because i wasn't a fan of the sauce or I would definitely try something else without sauce."}
{"text":"We skipped appetizers tonight but I ordered the Tour of Italy consisting of chix Parm, fettuccine alfredo, lasagna, a meatball and 2 pieces of sausage. It was good but not great. No bread with a pasta dish at the price of $19.99. The salad was minuscule and quite frankly a joke. 
The wife got a Pittsburgh sammy which she said was very good. 
The kid scarfed on a pepperoni pizza and I stole a piece, it was okay at best. 
The desserts were good but not great at $6 a piece. Tiramisu, chocolate cake and a banana cake that didn't taste much like banana creme. A solid 3 but that's it."}
{"text":"Going downhill fast.  
Order a dozen of wings you only get 10.  Wednesday wing night isn't wing night anymore.  No more specials.  
Employees are rude to customers."}
{"text":"Stuffed chicken breast in cream sauce, pasta Nicole, tuna salad, all great meals. Good selection of beer, friendly wait staff, entree's just under $20. All lead to a very nice evening which we are determined to repeat often. The only downside is the location of the restroom - (we ate on the deck). This place offers live entertainment on Wednesdays, including some jazz acts on occasion. I really appreciate that they support live music."}
{"text":"Decent sized outdoor area.  Extremely choppy interior, both bar and restaurant which are separated by an exterior/interior doorway.  We come for trivia, definitely not for their stellar service or vast beer selections which they have neither.  

So in the past few months that we have been coming I have observed that they host trivia on what is probably the worst night to do so for a bar.  That would be Friday.  A few times we have just left or received texts from our friends that there was nowhere to sit so don't bother coming.  I like the Friday night trivia myself.  It's nice to relax and not have to dread the next morning work day, but the bar is already stocked full of usual weekend warriors and doesn't need the help from pulling the trivia crowd.  

The space.  Well first time there for trivia it had to be a scorching 5 degrees outside and they had a huge missing ceiling tile right above our table that blew freezing cold air down my neck the whole time.  I shivered for two hours never shedding my coat.  Why they couldn't have [At least!] temporarily patched it with cardboard is beyond me.  When asked about this gaping hole, the server simply apologized, but did disclose it had been like that for over a day.  A DAY!  We are in the midst of a winter blast think that might have been a priority?  NAH.  

Next the service, spotty with a chance of clouds and possibly a short service window.  If you get the servers attention order.  Order right away and order two. Or a pitcher.  What not to order?  Well fish for one.  Definitely don't do that.  Our trivia buds usually order some bar apps to snack on but I can't go on their recommendation of good food, seeing how they consume food plastered in buckets of ranch.   

So...Trivia is fun.  I will keep going for that.  And the outdoor area should be opened soon, which will hopefully make the atmosphere much more enjoyable."}
{"text":"Stopped in for pizza and cold ones with a large group, including kids.  They accommodated us promptly and seated us in the non-smoking dining room.  I like that they have separate spots to dine for smokers and non-smokers as it seemingly keeps everyone happy. 

As for the service, we had a friendly waiter who was attentive, yet not bothersome throughout the meal and managed to meet our table demands with the wide variety of food and beverages we selected.  

As for the food, the pizza was pretty good as were some of the other foods we sampled...fried goat cheese and calzones.  

In short, this is a good stop for families who want some decent Italian fare for a good value.  If you're on the Golden Mile, give it a try."}
{"text":"This place has really gone downhill and not worth it for the prices. Ordered a 6 inch sub for the lunch special and now I regret tipping in a sense because I saw it after the fact/take out. Never again! (Yes I took a bite because I was so hungry before it occurred to me to take a photo.) I didn't major in math but that's not 6 inches."}
{"text":"My very first review. This is the only restaurant that has ever compelled me to write one. I'll only be commenting on the take out from the middle pizza shop area. I have NOT sat in their restaurant and I don't want anyone to misinterpret my review as one for the bar or restaurant. 

First things first. The pizza is great. The pizza has the sloppy authentic feel to it and is flavorful. If you are looking for clean cut, hold with one hand type pizza this is not it. The pepperoni is the star. The pepperoni has a little more spice to it than your run of the mill pizza shop and is piled on generously.

The food comes at a cost: the customer service. I've ordered take out from here roughly 10 times and just thinking of dealing with the employees makes me angry. I'm writing this review because I considered ordering from there for lunch today and it angered me.

The two highlights that tipped me over the edge (after other smaller infractions):

I call ahead and order a large pizza, half pepperoni. I give my name and they tell me 15 mins. So far so good. I show up in 20 mins looking for my pizza and the guy looks at me, sees me see that zero pizzas are in the oven or on top of the oven (waiting to be picked up), and immediately starts haphazardly throwing together my pizza. I know he screwed up. He knows I know he screwed up but he chooses to ignore it and tell me \"5 mins\" anyway. I stand around and wait for my pizza to be done. I get home and it looks a mess just as I would suspect a pizza made like that to look like.

I swear I won't go back. But I try one more time:

I order an item off of their menu called the \"plain steak and cheese\". The sandwich is just steak and cheese and is $2 cheaper than the \"original steak sub which comes with your usual vegetables. I also order that same large pizza with half pepperoni. Surely they can't mess this up again.

I show up to pick up my order but this time I am prepared. I'm going to leave with the food I ordered, prepared correctly, and in a timely fashion. I was wrong.

I asked for my steak and cheese and pizza and they start to ring me up. I see my pizza box waiting for pickup so I assume everything is ok. Being cautious I say before I sign this and put any type of tip of like to see my food. I even say that I have had a very low success rate of getting my food right. She asks for the steak and cheese, a guy hands it to her, she hands it to me and I open it. In all of my disbelief I am shocked to see it has all of the things I did not want (cannot eat) on it. So I say \" this is not what I ordered, steak and cheese, plain steak and cheese. It's even advertised on your menu as plain steak and cheese\". The guy says I'll have one for you in one moment and \"finds\" me one in roughly 3 mins. I'm not sure how this happened but I was happy to be able to leave at this point. I now take my check and STILL give a tip on principle. After returning home I look at the receipt to find I was charged for the more expensive sandwich. 

Sounds like minor issues but I promise you that other things have happened in addition to these and they have got me to the point where I feel they don't care at all about customers who want to give them money. 

If you want take out from here please do not expect any type of customer service or you will be disappointed."}
{"text":"Fish sandwich was bland mediocre at best . The service was poor. No refills until the very end of the meal. Found myself chewing on ice cubes by the end of my meal. Server did not seem happy to be there. Will not be returning."}
{"text":"We have eaten at Pugliano's at lest 10 times over the last 2 years. I never bothered to write a review but I think one is due.
Overall we really enjoy eating here in the back dining room. In the center there is a take out section and counter.  Up front is the bar and TVs but to our dislike there is much smoking there and we feel it is bad for our health in the bar. 
However but back in the dining room it's a different story. It is fairly nice and clean with lot's of people in there always. You will see couples, families and groups,  enjoying some kind of food. To be clear, there is a full bar menu from the dining room and you can order cocktails and wine with your dinner.
The food ranges from pizza and other Italian choices ,plus seafood, prime rib and many other choices. 
For apps we like the wedding soup and the hot stuffed peppers; these two are my favorites. For dinner my wife almost always gets the prime rib and she is never disappointed. She likes a creamy horseradish sauce as an accompaniment.  I usually order some type of pasta with seafood, with my favorite being the salmon Ala vodka with bow-tie pasta, which is always great.
In summary Pugliano's is definitely one of our favorite local area restaurants. In it's class of restaurant I give it 4 stars."}
{"text":"Pretty standard bar/grill type food. The pizza and wings are really good, beyond that everything else I've had has been average. Most items are frozen/deep fried and either lack flavor, or are so heavily seasoned it becomes inedible. Not sure if they've since changed, but the bar is SUPER smoky."}
{"text":"Driving down the icy highway, I was reminded how much I missed the cold. Snow covered trees fancied the white winter wonderland as far as the eye could see. 

Warm tea and a moderately effective heater kept me warm in the car during the \"what's for lunch\" banter. As we passed various establishments, we noticed a slew of \"for lease\" and \"closed\" signs.  
It was evident that  this horrid economy was taking it's toll, especially on the local joints. 

Luckily, Pugliano's was open for business and ready for a native Californian.  Compared to the other chains on the main highway, this was the most promising, viable option. Complete with a snow covered outdoor patio, wood paneling, and a warm fireplace, this joint demonstrated lots of charm.  I overheard someone mention that during the summer, the outdoor patio is great escape from the workplace. 

After looking at the smoked salmon and grilled chicken salads, I ordered based on a suggestion.  It was the Greek Salad that had the most rave reviews.  Served with mixed greens, fresh vegetables, red onion, roasted red peppers, Kalamata olives, feta cheese, and feta fatty dressing, this $8.99, salad was very filling.  Although a little pricey, the greens were good (I ordered the dressing on the side)  Pugliano's serves it all, and with the cold weather, I couldn't help but remain glued to the fireplace.

If you don't want the standard Quizno's, Subway, or \"for lease\" signs, then this is a great, business lunch option."}
{"text":"This place is a nightmare. We stopped here a few weeks back and I've been dying to leave my thoughts here for other yelp users so they know to avoid this place at all costs.

For starters, we saw an extremely loud, blatantly drunk individual the minute we walked in. We later found out this was owner of this bar. I cant believe that an owner would be this belligerent in his own bar.

Next, the bartenders were only taking drink orders from the owner and regulars. After awhile, we watched the regulars even walking out because all they were doing was talking to the owner.

The owner went back to the kitchen at one point, could barely walk, and starts screaming at the top of his lungs at the cooks.

We ordered food, even after that, figuring it would be decent since they were just scolded (lol), we were dead wrong. Chicken parmesan tasted like it was in a freezer for 6 months. The wings were cold, no surprise after waiting for 45 minutes with about 10 people in the bar, none of them eating by the way. The fries were terrible and the celery was literally rotten and brown.

 After another hour, we decided to try another bar because this place was awful. 

I saw in another post about a police officer in the parking lot, we experienced the same. There was a uniform officer marking back windows to pull over later.

I was here a few times in the past and with what started out as maybe a three star bar at best, has drastically decreased in quality. Each time worse than the last. We will never go here again, and I hope the drunk owner reads this and realizes his actions lost a multi million dollar earner as a customer... one who enjoys keep money in the local community. I will be spending my money everywhere else in plum... never here."}
{"text":"I was apprehensive about this place because of all the bad reviews, but I'm glad I stopped by and checked it out for myself.

Pugliano's offers your standard neighborhood bar/restaurant fare, with a focus on Italian dishes, steak, and sandwiches. I wouldn't go out of my way to eat there, but the food is tasty and far better than what you'd get at any of the the plethora of chain restaurants in the Monroeville/Murrysville area.

The bar offers a good selection of beer, wine, and cocktails, and each time I've had a cocktail they've been well made without skimping on the liquor.

Service is okay - a bit slow at times, but the servers are very friendly. My fianceé visited with a few friends, and her server remembered her when we came in weeks later."}
{"text":"We just had a surprise party for my son at Puglianos.  The food was delicious, the service was outstanding.  I recommend everyone have their event here!  I cannot say enough good things about both the food, the accommodations and especially the servers!  Thank you!"}
{"text":"I'm really glad Pugliano's is where it is.  It's not far from where I work, and it is a great place to stop for a beer or two with my friends in that area after I'm done.  

It has two sections, the bar and the dining room.  Any food from the menu can also be consumed at the bar.  This is how they get my money, because their food is irresistible.

The bartenders are very friendly, and will strike up a conversation with you about anything.  The one bartender is pretty funny.  The atmosphere is good.  It gets a little loud, but you can still hear the person you're talking to.  The beer is not very expensive, though they usually have something that doesn't interest me at all on special.  I never drink a lot there, though, because I inevitably have to drive somewhere after I'm done.

The food is a step above, but doesn't cost much more than your average Italian meal.  Whoever formulates their entrees is pretty good at what he or she does.  I can't remember the name of the one dish I ate that had me singing praises for weeks, but it was a pasta dish with bits of lamb in it, olives, and a balsamic reduction sauce.  If you see anything like that on the menu, GET IT.  It was unbelievably good.  It seems as if it's hard to go wrong with the menu, though.

Downsides? The parking lot can be a bit insane.  For whatever reason, every time I go there, there's some terrible driver making my parking lot experience really frustrating.  Also the location of the men's room in the bar section with its door right next to the kitchen makes me afraid I'll run someone over on the way out of the bathroom.  I almost wandered into the kitchen one time on accident.  But I think that's my fault, not theirs.

Pugliano's comes with my recommendation."}
{"text":"One star because they permit smoking in the bar area.  How can you operate an eating establishment in 2015 when you allow people to smoke?  

Sorry but the place does have potential."}
{"text":"My brother works near by and eats here a lot.  He constantly raves about how good the food is and I definitely wanted to go.  Seems like the restaurant is divided into multiple sections with a patio, bar area, banquet room and dining room in the back.  Definitely bigger than it looks from the outside.  

Both of my visits were on a Saturday.  Both times the service was very slow.  Very slow.  I mean, snail crawling through super glue slow.  My brother insists that this is not Monday-Friday service, but even he was visibly annoyed.  

My food was good.  My first visit I had a Ruben which was better than average.  The fries were fine, no complaints.  My second visit I had the Big G, which was an Italian version on a cheesesteak.  Again, very good but a bit spicier than I expected.  Nothing extraordinary, but both very good and reasonably priced.  

Large menu full if various Italian options which I would like to try.  I think perhaps the menu is a bit too large.  But if they can manage the quality and consistency, why not?  

Then it came time for my check and I had utilized a Groupon during my second visit.  Minds were blown.  You would think I asked them to perform advanced calculus.  In the end, 64 minutes later for a couple of sandwiches, it all ended well.  

I will definitely go back when I have a few hours to kill."}
{"text":"We moved to Plum 2 years ago and were thrilled to have this restaurant so close. I'd have to say I have been disappointed for the past 3 visits. Tonight I tried to order the prime rib sandwich from the special menu and they were out. Chose another dinner and waited. The server came out 20 minutes later and told us they were also out of the pork chops. At that point we cut our losses and went to Subway. If you can't keep food in stock then shorten the menu...."}
{"text":"Really wish the bar wasn't smoking since it is the nicest sports bar environment in the area (it reminds me of Sharkys in Latrobe). We ordered an Italian sampler and it was average. I really liked the fried goat cheese and aoili dipping sauce but unfortunately i got pretty sick after eating here. That being said it is a nice looking bar and I will give it another chance."}
{"text":"I visited Pugliano's prior to a work meeting. With little breakfast in my belly, I was glad for a warm meal. I visited on a Friday and there were plenty of lunch specials.

Given it was during Lent (and boy do I love me a fish sandwich!), I chose the cod sandwich for my meal. When it arrived, the fish was overcooked to the point where I couldn't take a bite because it was so tough. This is fish, people! If it's too tough to eat there is a major problem.

Overall the restaurant was fine, but looked a little outdated. The seating was very tight and I kept getting bumped up a chair behind me or the moving aside for a waitress to walk through.

I'm glad I got some lunch in me, but I won't be back."}
{"text":"The dine-in service is poor. They have gotten my take-out orders wrong countless times. The food is overpriced and bland. The only reason I ever went to Pug's was for their pizza. Which as of today seems to have changed for the worse. The pizza I ordered today was bland and tasted like a generic, mass-produced pizza. Gone is their good crust. They used to use a large, spicy pepperoni which is also gone. The only other item on the menu that had any worth was the beefy cheese which has also been reduced to a barely 6-inch long sandwich with a handful of overcooked meat and bad cheese for an outrageous $9.99. I will never be ordering any food from Pug's again.

I hesitated to write a bad review, but I have had SO many negative experiences at this restaurant that I will not be going back again."}
{"text":"This place is Awesome - went in here with my brother Matt. He seemed to know a lot of people, so I immediately got this idea that it's one of those real Quality places where everyone knows everyone - but- the big difference to here and other places like it is ----------- --------- --------- They welcome new people in just like everyone else does. 

it's the culture of the place that creates that - talked to some of the locals - all good people was my impression. I ordered the surf and turf from Eric, our cool barkeep. After a couple beers, decided to try the wine - why not right, at a place they prob serve mostly beer and guess what - it was good. I had 2 different pinot noirs and they were both delicious - started with really good wedding soup - I'm a broth lover and the broth had been made well with tasty mini-meatballs - and then to the Entrée - with the all lump crab meat -crab cake and deliciously tender filet mignon that had that slight grill flavor that I LOVE. 

Unbelievably Great Meal at a place I would not have expected. I feel like I lucked out or something it was so good and everyone was so cool. It was the perfect Pittsburgh experience I was looking for with my infamous brother."}
{"text":"Puglianos is one of the best resteraunts in plum .  Their pasta and salads are the best.   I order the chicken salads usually, however this week I tried something new.  I don't remember the name but is was a pasta dish. It was stuffed tortellini with a red cream sauce.  I loved it.  Puglianos is our favorite place to eat when we want to stay local.  I would definitely reccommend!"}
{"text":"Recently moved within a 5 minute drive to here. It's our go to take out when we don't feel like cooking. We ate in a few times as well. Service isn't amazing but it's mediocre and totally tolerable. Everyone we have encountered from service to take out is always pleasant. Everything I have had from here has been delicious from salads to wings to pizza to entrees. The menu is huge and there are so many things I still need to try. Prices are very reasonable as well. I will definitely be going back here time and time again."}
{"text":"Started our Pugliano's adventure with a somewhat snarky exchange between hostess and waitress.  Both absolutely ignored the fact that we were two feet away.

Once resolved there was an invisible veil of negativity lifted and the service (same waitress) was flawless, prompt and friendly.

Starting with the house Sangria (white).  Not awesome.  A water glass of wine + seltzer + an orange slice does not a sangria make.  

Appetizers of stuffed banana peppers and the most fabulous looking zucchini erased the sangria-pout.  Dinners were equally fab, everything from kisses to salmon - loved them all.

Desserts were beautiful and sweet, removing the ding on the opening flavor-that-need-not-be-mentioned-again!

We've been here several times and from the food is terrific, regardless the dish!"}
{"text":"No complaints I must say. This place was packed on a Friday night. They have two separate sections, a bar side and a restaurant side. 

We sat in the restaurant close to the fireplace although it wasn't active. I ordered their Kelly pie which is a pizza topped with all kinds of veggies. White sauce, spinach, mushrooms, roasted red peppers and a few other toppings.

Husband ordered half rack of ribs and the kids ordered a sausage pizza and cheese ravioli. Everyone enjoyed their food. The sausage pizza was great even the crust. Cheese ravioli was perfectly cooked. My nephew enjoyed his ravioli with grated parm and couldn't get enough. We considered eating dessert but we so full we had no room. Our waiter Rodger was very good. Brought our food out in a timely manner and checked on us to make sure everything was good.

I think next time I will try to go when it isn't so busy, maybe a Tuesday Or Wednesday."}
{"text":"The restaurant service was great as was the food! The main dining room was filled & busy, and although we didn't have reservations we only waited 10 minutes. The lasagna was ridiculously huge and delicious...the noodles tasted homemade. The manicotti and cannelloni were equally good. Artichoke dip was a great appetizer...pipin hot and generous. As for dessert we went with our friendly waitress' recommendation of the 7 layers of dreamy mousse pie....yummy!

The only negative....down the hall, indoor smoking is still allowed in their full bar."}
{"text":"I haven't had the opportunity to try all of the entrees yet, but I've eaten here for lunch on the patio. Service was good, and the salmon salad was excellent. My only negative is that smoking is allowed in the outside area."}
{"text":"Very disappointing . Margarita had no taste of tequila tasted like ice water... food was tasteless. We came for dinner and left after appetizers. We go out to dinner every week, decided to try this restaurant . We won't be back."}
{"text":"The parking lot and multiple entrances are difficult to understand. The actual restaurant, non-bar area was really tucked into this narrow building! 

I liked the dipping oils that came with the free bread. Zesty! We took the in-laws here on a cold, cold Feb night and they enjoyed it. The food was good-tasting and the portions were big. I like the extensive and varied selections on their menu. The location is the number one reason I chose this place as it's close to my work and my home. Service was okay, not particularly memorable, but the prices were too high for the noisy, crowded, confusing ambiance. I probably see myself going in the future just because it's the only Italian sit-down restaurant on Golden Mile Highway."}
{"text":"Very good food and service.   Never disappoints.  Just wish the bar area was non smoking."}
{"text":"My family and I have done two substantial take out orders in the last couple of months and have been disappointed. On the first order, I was lucky enough to bite into a rubber band that was baked into my calzone, I guess that's better than a hair .  Other aspects of our order were incorrect as well.  Just yesterday, I was opposed, but my wife decided to do another large takeout order and again we were all disappointed (shame on us). Won't be ordering from there again. I'm not a nitpicking guy, but when I spend almost a hundred dollars on each order I expect the order to at least be correct. Even if I'm not a fan of the taste, at least give us what we ordered. Fortunately for us, there are several other similar places to take our business"}
{"text":"For the last few months we have been coming here for their trivia night on Friday nights.  We have had a good time.  We have just been in the bar area but they have a outside patio that is covered as well.  That should be nice and welcomed when it gets warmer out because on Trivia night it gets pretty busy in here.  There is a restaurant and a banquet room too in the back.  The first time we came here we had to sit underneath a hole in the ceiling.  Hole or vent I'm not sure what it was but it was blowing freezing air on us.  That was very uncomfortable.  The next week that we came they did fix it and it felt a lot better in there.

 We haven't tried any food here yet but our friends who we came with have.  They got basic bar food but that's just not for us.  It looked good but nothing worth ordering ourselves.  They told us the fish sandwiches weren't that good so we didn't  try their fish either during Lent.  They have a decent amount of beer on tap but we just keep it light usually and order a pitcher of Miller Lite that is cheap and still allows us to have a good time at Trivia.  Also key in winning!  

 It's a bar with a restaurant.  We probably wouldn't come here to eat dinner any time but for a few drinks while watching a game maybe?  They do have a nice size bar but it isn't too inviting.  The tables that we sit at are ok but nothing to clean and inviting either.  The service has been pretty good and the trivia is great.  Regardless if you come here for some Trivia on a Friday night you will have some fun and enjoy yourself."}
{"text":"The service at Pugliano's was absolutely horrible. We arrived at lunch time - not many people in the restaurant area, yet we waited over an half hour for our food. An employee greeted us and we should have turned around and left at the moment. She was abrupt and rude. She continued that way throughout the service. She asked my mom if she wanted \"blackened chicken.\" Without even giving her a chance to speak, she raised her voice. \"I said, do you want blackened chicken?\" Her tone was rude and haughty. She rushed us through our meal and brought our check before we were halfway finished eating. The entire experience was uncomfortable and the food was okay, but I'd prefer Olive Garden. Same prices, better service."}
{"text":"1st time visitor. Pretty cool place inside, it's huge. Was there on a Saturday night at 5. Ordered a club sandwich which was made with thick toasted Italian bread. Tons of meats and cheese and lettuce etc and it was tasty . I'm a club fan and this was super. Baked potato was made just right. Crab cakes had 2 huge cakes that looked like 99%crab. Was told they were some of the top crab cakes in the city. Chicken salad with fries etc looked fresh made and the person loved it as well."}
