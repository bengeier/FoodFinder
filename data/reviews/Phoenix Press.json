{"text":"Excellent selection of coffees.  Plus homemade sodas for a $1.  Shop is run by people dedicated to making Phoenix a better place."}
{"text":"Excellent coffee - choose drip or french press and choose from a variety of local roasts. I recommend the egg sandwich - simple and tasty - the best flavor in the eggs,  a great bread and cheese. 

Small - but has wifi. Community oriented. I'd love to see some outside seating though! :)"}
{"text":"Great choices for coffee and preparation! Staff was enthusiastic and knowlegable. We need this place . There is live, local entertainment next door. Vegan, organic donuts from bakery behind. Yummmm."}
{"text":"No finer people in the world to have a cup of coffee with. The owner/operators are like instant family. Go in, sit down, enjoy life and feel the spirit of a place that is truly loved. Come as a stranger leave as family."}
