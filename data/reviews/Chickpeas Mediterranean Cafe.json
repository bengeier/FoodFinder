{"text":"Excellent resturant. Great variety of tasty and healthy dishes. I have been in Chickpeas restaurant in the past 7 months many times both for lunch and dinner. Some times with friends and relatives. We will go back whenever we have the opportunity. The restaurant is clean, very friendly atmosphere, excellent food and prices are very reasonable. Recently, they revised their menu. Excellent selection of tasty foods. We have been there with freinds and relatives, they love to go back there too; they really have enjoyed it. This resturant has a great menu, Pizzas, Mediterranean, and Persian dishes, as well as fresh pastries and bread that they bake every few hours. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"The food is good, but don't expect friendly or even helpful service, I stopped in for lunch, looking at the giant lunch menu board behind the register I picked the ground beef kabob plate special for $7.99 , the photo shows this dish with two kabob strips, I asked the cashier if I could get one strip of chicken kabob for one beef since the chicken plate is the same price, the cashier said no and that in order to do that I would have to order off of a different menu, my wife had ordered the chicken and said we could exchange one strip of beef for chicken amongst ourselves since her order comes with two strips of chicken kabob as the photo of the order shows, when we got our order to our surprise both of our lunch specials came with only one strip of kabob! The Cashier did not take the time or courtesy to explain to me when I ordered that the lunch special comes with one strip of kabob and to get a second one I could have paid a mere two dollars more, the only thing the cashier said was to mix and match I'd have to order off the standard menu, when I asked the cashier if I could pay the additional charge in order to get the second strip of meat as the price of $9.99 he said NO, you have to order another new order?! I was disappointed and it was not like the place was busy, the restaurant was empty around noon , the food was good but disappointed with the service and lack of care for the customer"}
{"text":"Had dinner at Chickpeas this evening.  The food was fabulous. Can't wait to go back again.  Is now one of my favorite places to eat.  Would highly recommend it."}
{"text":"My husband has raved about how the chicken shwarms at Chickpeas is so good.  Just left the place, I didn't have the Shwarma but did enjoy my order of the lamb bowl. The dressing used for the salad is the bomb! The lamb could have been a little more tender and little less grisssel. And the portions were more than enough."}
{"text":"I have been here multiple times and am always pleased. Food is great tasting, always fresh, and good portions. Service is great and servers are always polite and friendly.  Very reasonable prices too."}
{"text":"I'm from Cali and have had kabob many times- but I was definitely impressed with our meal. I came with my husband and kids and everyone ate up. We ordered the koobideh and chicken kabob, rice and kashk e bademjoon. My husband also got a mezza plate- all was excellent. Fresh food, clean and welcoming environment, and great portion size and prices- We'll definitely be back when we come to town again!"}
{"text":"Cooked with heart, that why the food taste so good Recommend to try the chicken shawarma"}
{"text":"Best Mediterranean food I've ever had!! It's even too much for me to finish, I usually eat 3lbs of food as a meal lol"}
{"text":"Ive been here several times and the food is always delicious and customer service is excellent. I live across town but it's worth the drive to come here!! I strongly recommend coming here, everything on the menu is absolutely amazing."}
{"text":"Alex is a phenomenal chef who offers an incredible array of Mediterranean foods from many countries including Isreal. Chickpeas even offers chicken wings and gourmet pizzas!!!  They are constantly cleaning (I have watched him clean his knives after every use!) Even though they have take out deli, I can't wait until tomorrow to come back."}
{"text":"The food here is wonderful everything is really fresh and cooked to perfection. The people have fantastic attitude and treat you like they are family can't ask for too much more."}
{"text":"Very disappointed, what they show and what they serve is not the same. Showed picture of 2 stops of beef and safrone rice but they didn't driver when asked they said that it's only a picture not what they serve so with I could give no stars. Will never come here again and never will recommend I would stay away from here"}
{"text":"Value for money! Huge servings for reasonable price. One of the best Mediterranean places in Las Vegas. Clean and good service. Highly recommendable!"}
{"text":"Price was right especially for the generous portions they give. Food was good. A house sauce of some type would be nice for the meat plates since they are a bit plain."}
{"text":"AMAZING! If you are in the ar a a you must try this place. Food is presented exactly like the pictures. They make sure that everything you are eating or drinking is absolute quality. Thoroughly impressed for the price."}
{"text":"Simply delicious. Fresh ingredients. Friendly staff. I want to see more people in here and share this wonderful place with all of Vegas!"}
{"text":"One of the best places I recently ate! Big portions, very delicious and the staff is very nice especilly Kro, who always prepairs everything fast and with smile and exactly as you want it. Recommend!"}
{"text":"What a pleasant surprise this place was. The food was excellent.  The amount of food you get for the price is amazing. The staff was super friendly. Can't wait to come back and try something else."}
{"text":"YUMMY Mediterranean food and reasonable prices!  Great atmosphere and very friendly staff. The shawarma is delish!! Can get a full, fresh meal for under $10!  We will be back!  Hope to see many more of you here!!"}
{"text":"Chickpeas is a great spot for a Mediterranean meal - lunch or dinner! We keep coming back because of the personable customer service, great food quality, and the lovely atmosphere (outdoor patio is our favorite - it even has misters during the summer.) The prices are soo reasonable for the quality, flavors, and portions of the protein. My personal favorite, that I order everytime, is the Chicken Shawarma either as a sandwich (comes on pita bread with lettuce, veggies, hummus, and tzatziki yogurt sauce) or on the Greek salad - you cannot go wrong!"}
{"text":"It is one best Mediterranean cafe in Vegas. I had the beef barg kabob and chicken barg kabob it was so tender and nice. Also if you et a chance try shirazi salad"}
{"text":"Love this place. We come here at least two or three times out of the week. We just tried the meat lovers pizza and this is the first pizza that  my family and I ate and didn't lrave us feeling sick from all the cheese and grease after.  The pizza left us satisfied and full . We will definitely order it again."}
{"text":"I love there food, sooooooo delicious!!! They the best baklava in town and my Salmon salad is the BEST. I eat here often and the food is consistently on point. Thank you Alex for always making my experience second to none,  so Awesome!!!!!!"}
{"text":"Another great meal at Chickpeas!  Tried the new Zaffron Chicken--super good. And of course the tabouli salad is always perfect.  Generous portions make for tasty leftovers. Can't wait to be in that area again for more."}
{"text":"I was looking for Persian food since a while. Finally found this place. Love the food so much. So yummy and great service."}
{"text":"Perfect Mediterranean food! Coming from the NY/NJ area I can say that the food here really matches up well. Very affordable and trust me you get your money's worth. The kabobs are so tender they melt in your mouth. You will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"I will give them 2 stars because the cashier girl was nice. If I can critique solely on the food I would give them a 1 star. I'm all about trying new places and this time unfortunately I was not happy with the food. Portion size of the plate was about 90% rice and salad and 3 little pieces of meat. I got the lunch special beef barg and it looked like a rice salad. Was not impressed by the flavor. Sorry but I've found better places in Vegas that serve Mediterranean/ Armenian/ Iranian food."}
{"text":"just had a bbq chicken pizza which 10inch, it is taste good with portion of chicken. For more people 18inch is better. I maybe try regular cheese pizza next time cuz i am a halal eater!"}
{"text":"Just opened recently. I love k-bobs so, I thought I would check it out. It is a well decorated place with both indoor and outdoor seating. VERY CLEAN. There is a beautiful oven in the corner.  Anyway,  the food was excellent and the service fast and easy. 5 stars. I eat out daily and I will be a regular."}
{"text":"Was there for first time last Friday after work. The food was delicious for good reasonable price. Meet the chief Krasi very nice and he explained to me and my wife all what we want to know, so we made the right choice what to eat. The food came quick and very good prepared. Now me and my wife eat almost every day here"}
{"text":"Had raw pieces of chicken in my shawarma bowl. Rice was completely mushy, my wife was equally disappointed and could barely eat the beef. This is one of the few times Yelp has drastically let me down. In no way do they deserve a rating above 1 star. Avoid at all costs."}
{"text":"This place is amazing!  Real silverware for lunch!  Generous and delicious lunch specials!  I wish we had one in Miami!  I'm sure you can't find more healthier and tastier food in all of Vegas for the same price!"}
{"text":"Pleasantly surprised!!! We ordered delivery through bitesquad. I chose the place only due to my \"go-to\" place closing at 9pm. However. Chickpeas was open until midnight. The food was delicious and tasted homemade.  We had the Ghorneh Sabzi, Tazitki, and lentil soup. All were a hit. None of the items were over salted, which I usually find at casual/quick Mediterranean or Persian restaurants.  I cannot comment on the atmosphere, as we had delivery. But this is my new \"go-to\" for Persian delivery. Great find!!"}
{"text":"I want the Gheymeh and Ghormeh stews back!  I love their food. It comes in big plates with free house salad and really cheap price. I am not happy anymore because they removed Gheyme and Ghormeh stews from their menu."}
{"text":"I order from there first time everything was delicious hummus was awesome  They can improve on the pizza and adding little more flavor to the meat , it had flavor but it could use a little more flavor"}
{"text":"Fantastic food. Great service. We were all impressed with the quality of food.  The salad was great.  Their section of kabobs was good and they actually tasted great.  Will definitely try it again while in Vegas."}
{"text":"This place is amazing! Wonderful healthy options. Great ownership. I have special food needs and this place worked for me. Plenty of no sugar and no flour options!"}
{"text":"This cozy cafe has a vast selection of fine tasting food that looks like you can eat it right from the pictures in the cafe. I have frequented many Mediterranean cafe's, but this one by far is one of the best. Upon receiving my order of the chicken koobideh, I could not believe the flavor and the tenderness of the chicken, some of the best I have ever had. Their customer service is great as well as great tasting food at realistic prices. \"I'll Be Back!\""}
{"text":"Food is very fresh, flavorful and healthy.  The owner is so nice. Ill be returning regularly."}
{"text":"I would like to start by saying the food is outstanding. The food was fresh ,served hot, and very fast.i ordered the chicken shawarma plate.the portions are hearty.now you know there had to be at least one issue.the young man that took my order and brought it out to me had really dirty nails.he was done taking my order when he stuck his finger in his ear and began to scratch his ear hole.yummy! By the time I got home I had thought about what had just happened. I decided to try a bite of chicken and we all know how rice tastes so there was no need to try that.i ended up throwing the hole plate away in fear of what was in his nails (not to mention in his ear) I will try again but not if he has dirty nails again."}
{"text":"Hands down the best Hummus in town. We go every Saturday to get a large order of Hummus so we have a supply all week. Along with great Hummus their staff and service has always been kind and spot on."}
{"text":"The lady that work in that place knows pretty much nothing on her menu and barely spoke english . I've ordered #27 beef lula ( ground meat ) and beef kabob with rice and salad . In the menu the price was 14.95 she charged 16.95 . When I asked Why's that she couldn't answer . Told me the price are changed . This is unacceptable  . The meat was a lil dry , the salad was good . Bottom line is don't think I'll come back"}
{"text":"I was looking forward to finding a good chicken shawarma sandwich in Vegas and I decided to give this place a try. Let's just say I'm disappointed once again. The chicken was full of fat and I couldn't chew it. How do you eat a chicken sandwich when u can chew the chicken? Although, the office did have them cater their meeting, and the hummus, baba ganoush, rice, chicken, lamb and beef kabobs were amazing."}
{"text":"Love the ground combo platter!!! Hopefully you'll get a chance to try the baklava and cucumber water fresh!!!"}
{"text":"WOW! So glad I stopped in. Almost drove by this place and was not disappointed at all. So good, so fresh and perfectly healthy.   The place is fairly new from what I can tell but the staff was wonderful and attentive. Most importantly SHAWARMA WAS BOMB. Had a (*huge*) bowl (comes w rice and salad) half chicken and beef. Think I'm in super like with chicken but obsessed with the beef. All that for $8 and change. I'm terrified how big the plate size must be  Also: the cucumber dip   This place is not to be missed! Check out the pics. Great for takeout or sit in. Looks like they also do breakfast, pizza, and kabobs  can't wait to have a cappuccino and to bring a friend next time.  I'll definitely be back!!!!"}
{"text":"When I try new places, like most people, I'm a little hesitant.  This Mediterranean Cafe is in a location that is probably a tough sell for a small businesses but I would suggest giving it a try just once.  It's always clean and organized.  The food is rich with veggies and flavorful.  All the traditional foods are there and the prices are incredible. Huge portions!!!!"}
{"text":"I tried their kabob mix i paid almost $12 i only got rice and tomato. No pita bread no soda. Chicken had some flavor. The beef was burnt and dry. I liked their patio dining area. But the inside corner area is very uncomfortable to sit and eat. You almost feel like you are going to hit your head. No customer service at all. No one asked me how I was doing if I needed anything."}
{"text":"I like everything about this place. Delicious, presentation on real plates and silverware, great music, prices, informal, welcoming atmosphere but not in your face, cucumber water on the house self serve which is surprisingly delicious and refreshing, owner sits doing his work with his guests or behind the counter, reasonable wait for each dish custom made--- all the good qualities of faster food without the factory line push. As the terminator said,\"I'll be back.\""}
{"text":"My friend took us here and for the whole week we visited this place at least 3 more times!!! The people are friendly, place is clean and food is awesome. Things to order:  Eggplant mint dip (make sure it's warm) Hummus Kuku sabzi (Persian vegetables and egg dish) Falafel Beef Rice is nicely cooked no oil at all  Napoleon pastry   Super tasty and healthy"}
{"text":"Very flavorful!! I love the atmosphere the owner is a doll. Checked on patrons as they ate. As I waited for my meal he even offered me to taste test some of the food that I never tried without me even asking! My new fave place"}
{"text":"The place is awful!! Never ever ever ever go there. They brought half of the order and when they were finished they brought the rest half! There is no management here! And the lettuce in salad is not washed at all! JUST AUWFUL!      !      !"}
{"text":"I LOVE THIS PLACE!!! The food portions are quite big they will custom make your order on just about anything you want!!! I get the Mazzo plate & they custom make it to what I want!!! Great food clean place & friendly service!!! They always have cucumber water with lemons and its fresh and refreshing!!!"}
{"text":"Just ordered delivery and was pleasantly surprised! Best falafel I've ever had! It was crunchy on the outside and soft on the inside with tons of flavor. I ordered the sandwich so it came in this bread that was similar to ciabatta. The hummus is also so good here!"}
{"text":"Last night my wife and I went to Chickpeas Mediterranean Cafe for dinner. The food was excellent and service was great!!!"}
{"text":"Weed is legal in Las Vegas now and the reason why I'm completely stoned from potent doobs and dabs of rick Simpson oil, but its economics the reason I'm in a random strip mall tucked away from the strip. The schmancy hotel casino's laundry service is so expensive I couldn't fathom paying $5 to wash a single pair of underwear even if I happened to be rich as fuck... Anyway, I jumped on yelp and another doob and Lyft later I'm at the Coin laundry grooving to Micheal Jackson mixing a lethal baking soda/bleach mix for the tightie-whiteys. Was gonna kill the 20 min wash time with another doob so I started to walk around the strip mall, passing some random flooring place so weird bar Asian barbecue which almost tempted me but then I saw these words...   CHICKPEAS.   Fuck yeah the best decision I made this day while barely functioning. Creamy hummus warm pita...  Served by cuties I was in heaven. College football playing...This is THE hangout spot when guys running errands and his girl and her family's is back at home and he literally has a 20 minute why cycle before he has to get back in dry the whites. Or just some random dude like me in Vegas for a few nights with dirty underwear."}
{"text":"Very nice place the Shawarma was delicious very healthy servings the salmon sandwiches are awesome I feel like I have just tap this resource more to come later"}
{"text":"My first visit was when I met Alex. I came here feeling really hungry after my morning workout. I couldn't decide what to order because everything on the menu looks delicious. It's good knowing that Alex and the people who work here are friendly and courteous. It just shows how much they care for their customers. I finally chose the Koobideh Ground Chicken Kabob. I like how the chicken is so tender and flavorful. It came with a good amount of basmati rice, one grilled tomato, and a nice crisp salad with sliced tomatoes, cucumbers and red beets. I especially love their savory homemade dressing. Since then I have tried another item like their Chicken Schawarma plate, serve with a generous portion of marinated chicken, basmati rice, sliced tomatoes and cucumbers. But I always seem to have a particular favorite when I come here. The Koobideh Ground Chicken Kabob will forever be my #1 choice."}
{"text":"Decided to try a new Mediterranean restaurant and stumbled upon this one on yelp. We ordered for delivery which was free which is a nice perk. One of my co -workers got the falafel salad and she loved it and said the veggies where fresh and the falafel was good and not dry.   I had the wings with rice which was also very good and the serving size was very generous. We got a free side of hummus for ordering through yelp and the hummus was good. We will definitely be ordering from this location for work again as the food is delicious and the delivery is free."}
{"text":"After a long Memorial Day in pool I felt like having a cheat day!  Yes my cheat days seem healthy to most...but we eat oil free so this was a cheat day.  We ordered a huge delivery and it was A-Ok.  Huge portions, fresh food and overall yummy tastes.  Hummus was on the oily side but it was creamy and not toooo much garlic. Don't get me wrong I love garlic, but too much in hummus can cause indigestion.  The falafel would be best not delivered but eaten fresh on site. Yes its the green kind but it seemed hand formed inside of the machine ball or tool ball way.  The tabouli salad was super yummy to me, lots of green onion, which was different.   The baba was not as smoky as other places. Hubs normally does not like it but he tried this and liked it!  Ikra was yum, hubs didn't like the smoky flavor of it but I did!  All and all I would rank it in my top three of Vegas. Hubs said its better than Amena...but I beg to differ. Amena will always have me heart!"}
{"text":", my favorite restaurant I will take all my friends there and my beautiful family we enjoy your kabobs and your Middle Eastern food keep it up we love you"}
{"text":"Im from Los Angeles where Persian food is good. This place wouldn't last in LA. Cheap Basmati and cheap quality meat. 3 stars because I did not get food poisoning. I'll visit LA when I need my Persian fix."}
{"text":"New Mediterranean spot near my store! The food is so tasty and authentic! I have a middle eastern background so I know good Mediterranean food when I taste it! This place is good and a little pricey but worth it because the food is good. The people are nice. The restaurant is family owned (I'm pretty sure) which is nice to support local family business!"}
{"text":"I'm a pretty big guy that love to eat health. The portions were so large I took it home and made several meals. Great place! Great price plus the food is amazing...NICE!"}
{"text":"First time here... Ordered a beef wrap and it was SOOOOO delicious the meat was so tasty well seasoned... And their prices are affordable and it's easy to locate corner of jones and w flamingo... They also do delivery with NO minimum haven't tried doing delivery yet... But for sure I'll be back to try the other ones^__^ it's a must try so far one of the good Mediterranean place..."}
{"text":"Loved the food! Biig portion and very delicious. Totally willing to visit again! Thank you!"}
{"text":"Great food!  The mini pita breads, meat and all of the veggies were excellent. Unfortunately, I have to give two stars because I placed an order for delivery and it arrived 30 minutes late.  I had a staff of 10 folks on their lunch break just looking at me wondering where their food was for 30 minutes."}
{"text":"The hummus and the pizza were good.  Both salads we ordered were badly cut with really big pieces of herbs and stuff and it didn't taste fresh, the quinoa salad seemed to be from yesterday."}
{"text":"Best Mediterranean restaurant in town!!! Food is absolutely delicious, portions are big, staff very nice and attentive, place is very clean and chic! I highly recommend this place to anyone for an unforgettable culinary experience!"}
{"text":"Great restaurant . Food was delicious , I was attended by a young tall beatiful lady her costumer service was the greatest she was very helpful. I will definitely go back ."}
{"text":"This place is great! The people are super nice and want to make the patron happy. The food is amazing, I just kad the beef fillet kabob and I will not spend tons of money at a steak house again. Bang for buck one of the best places I've found!"}
{"text":"Drove by hungry and saw this place. Looks nice inside and decided to try. I had a mixed beef and chicken shawarma plate. The meat tasted great as did the salad. It had a Moroccan kinda flavor in there. It was a really generous size for the price of $8.95. I would def come here again if I'm in the area!"}
{"text":"I love Mediterranean good and have been to so many different ones here in vegas. I am also not very picky....but this food was horrible! The chicken was all fat. I was going to pick off chicken next day and just eat the salad and it tasted nasty. Ended up throwing it all away. Will stick with Sharma plus"}
{"text":"Very fresh food.  Greek salad with beef was terrific.   Hummus very fresh along with pita bread."}
{"text":"This place is consistent, clean and right on time!!! Every week me and my family have dinner here and we are alway pleased with the service and food!!! This is a must stop for your love of mediterranean food"}
{"text":"The food is absolutely delicious. Ive been twice and would definitely go again. Id just have to check my food first. The first time I went in, I to had drive back there because they left out one of my items. The second time I ordered 3 lamb shwarma plates for delivery, thanked and tipped the driver,  open my food, its all beef.  I know the difference between lamb and beef. I was a little disappointed being as though lamb is what I wanted and it does cost a little more than the beef. I would definately go again because it is good food with generous portions."}
{"text":"This is grrrreat food. Their salads are great. Their hummus is great. Everything is FRESH and delicious. Their falafels are wonderful. Their home made pitas are wonderful. Yum! And their prices are great. I come here a lot."}
{"text":"I have to start off by saying the food is good, but I ordered through yelp and ordered the \"smoked salmon artisan pizza\" which has is normally creme fraish and smoked salmon on top of a pizza crust just as their picture was listed on the app.....well, I got a pizza with cooked salmon and cheese with peppers definitely not what i ordered,  so to be helpful I called in to let chickpeas  know so at least  the next person ordering would not have the same issue, and I was told on the phone \"that's how we make it here\" I said that's not smoked salmon you are advertising it's something it isn't  and then she goes on by saying \"well we don't know how to make it and we weren't told how to make it and what to use the owner hasn't  let us know\" and she mentioned someone else just before me  and complained as well. Just made me not as inclined to ever order from them, or Call in the order instead of Yelp or another service Just kind of deceiving and no trying to resolve the matter."}
{"text":"I am really happy I finally tried this place. The food is delicious the portions are huge. I really love their salad and salad dressing. Very excited to see they are opening on South Rainbow closer to my house. I will definitely be a regular customer."}
{"text":"Picked this place because of the \"great\" reviews and wanted some good Persian kabobs. Really wish I didn't waste my money here.  The food was not as good as the reviews say and the service was horrible. First off, the salad wasn't bad tasting but it was more of an Asian flavor than middle eastern, so it didn't really go well with the kabobs.  Second I asked for the kabobs well done, not burned, well done. The guy looked at me like I was nuts. One side was not cooked and the other side was burned. I also asked to have the tomato well and that wasn't cooked through either. If you ask to have your food cooked well done, there shouldn't be any attitude about it, especially when you're a paying customer.  I would advice the owner to make sure his employees not give attitude to customers and for them to learn how to cook food properly.  Would not recommend this restaurant to people who are looking for authentic Persian food. If you don't care and want generic middle eastern food this is your spot!"}
{"text":"This place is LEGIT!!!  Good food and great service...what more do you need!?  Ok...the atmosphere is cool too. Certainly a hidden gem worth checking out."}
{"text":"Stopped in for a quick lunch.  Far exceeded my expectations.  The portions are huge, the seasonings are distinct and flavorful and everything is fresh!  Definitely a stop when I am in the area."}
{"text":"First time here ground beef very good. I will come back again! Amazing service. Also the house salad was very n great customer service"}
{"text":"This place used to be very good. Last time we ordered I had the lamb chops and kabob. It was overcooked. Not enough bread, none came with my $26 entre. Shish Kabob House next time. More affordable too."}
{"text":"Ive been living in Las Vegas for 9 months and there is no place I love going to eat on a weekly basis more than this amazing restaurant. The food is amazing and the staff is friendly and always willing to assist their customers with a smile and knowledge of their menu. Their generous portions will never leave you wanting for more. I recommend this place to anyone who loves Mediterranean and Persian food or to anyone wanting to try something new."}
{"text":"Addendum:  Was in town and just had to visit this place again. Just like the last time, great service and food and doesn't disappoint.  I ordered a greek salad on the side and the feta cheese was so fresh, moist and yummy! Which was probably fresh and UNpasteurized which unfortunately I cannot have right now. So went back inside (was sitting at the outside patio) and asked the employees. They said it should but seemed to question it themselves. As I sat back outside, one of the employees came back and said to be on the safe side, I probably shouldn't eat it and was happy to bring it back and make me a brand new one without the feta. That was awesome how careful and sweet they were. Can't wait to come back and eat it with the feta cheese next time when I finally can!  Note: Salad was yummy but not the traditional greek flavor which is more vinegary & garlicky. Instead it does have more of an asian soy saucy flavor. Still really yummy but then again, I'm asian so it prob taste yummier to me then to some people.  --------------  Was craving Mediterranean and decided to give this place a try and so glad I did! For the price you pay the portion itself is unbelievable. Most other places are pretty generic in portions and cost. The plate was $10 here so i assumed it was like most other places and my goodness the plate was enough to feed 2 people! (See pictures)  We ordered the ground beef and chicken skewer mix plate which comes with a side bowl of salad. The meat was flavorful and tender. Not dry at all. The salad was also a generous portion and their dressing was delicious! Simple yet flavorful. The rice I will have to say is the only thing that could be a little better. It wasn't flavored enough or shall I say enough butter like a lot of places do but in exchange, its much healthier that way. So I don't mind. We also ordered the chicken shawarma plate and it was charred perfectly. They have their own tahini sauce recipe that atop the shawarma plate. By itself, it tasted a bit plain and bitter with a nutty twist to it but the sauce goes with the chicken wonderfully! I even asked for extra sauce on the side.  They also make pizza too (and they have a huge pizza oven as well) which is out of ordinary but since I didn't order any can't rate much on that. Maybe next time.  Service: They were great. It think its a family owned operation. It does take a little time to prep your food but thats with most Mediterranean style restaurants and they were all working hard. I did hope they would have warned me how big their portions were so we could've ordered differently.   Ambiance: A little small shop with a little outdoor patio seating area thats pretty nice. Parking is plenty thats in a plaza. I will totally come back again!!"}
{"text":"Great lunch spot! Service could not be friendlier! Lunch menu is well priced and portions are large. We were not expecting salads before our lunch, so that was a nice plus. A few of us went there for lunch today and we each ordered something different. All dishes were great. Tasty food, good quality and big portions."}
{"text":"The food is great and it is one of the best Persian food we ever had. Nice environment, food is always fresh. Great prices and friendly services."}
{"text":"Their service is horrible. They gave fliers to people on the street to come here while they couldn't handle even a portion of them. The brought half of our order. I checked after 20 minutes realized they had forgotten the rest of our order. They even refuse to apologize for not bringing your food after an hour!  These are aside from the sticky tea mug (check out the picture) and below average food quality.  My suggestion: don't think about going to this place!"}
{"text":"I have been here twice and both times the food was great. I have tried the vegetarian meals and the cooked animal carcasses. Every time I have gone their food has been flavorful and they have decent prices!"}
{"text":"First time ordering from here for catered food and let me tell you. I requested the food be delivered by 5pm to a hotel suite for a surprise bday dinner for a family member and i received a call at 4:58pm saying he was downstairs in the lobby ready with all the food i ordered. Talk about punctual! the tandori, and beef and chicken kabobs were all tender and tasty and all the dips were flavorful! Definitely eating here again, thank you for your wonderful service and on-time delivery!"}
{"text":"Have had lunch and I love their menu. Great taste!! Place is clean, casual but most of all the customer service is very good!"}
{"text":"Officially open September 1st, Chickpeas is the newest Mediterranean spot in Vegas. Food is fresh and flavorful, and there's covered patio seating.  Menu has all the usual favorites: shwarma, tabouli, hummus, pita. Meats are available as plates, sandwiches, or (allegedly) on salads. They also offer breakfast.  I was thrilled to see Oliviet (Russian potato salad) on the menu! Unfortunately they were out of it on my most recent visit. Menu has no clear appetizers section- cashier had some difficulty adding a small order of falafel, as the menu only offers it as a plate or sandwich. Ordering \"Greek salad with chicken shwarma\" got me a side salad and a shwarma wrap, which isn't what I had in mind (salad topped with meat).  Ordering issues and new-opening kinks aside, the space is clean and organized. The falafel is soft and flavorful inside, but could be a bit crisper on the outside. It came with an ample portion of tahini sauce. The greek salad was tasty (heads up that it's pre-dressed) and the veggies were fresh. The shwarma wrap was nicely seasoned, and had a good amount of tomatoes and red onion, and a generous portion of meat. Unfortunately, the pita itself was falling apart before we were halfway though, which got messy."}
{"text":"I love this place. Taste ,value, and friendliness is great. Beverages drive the economical world, but I prefer water and they always have some chilled cucumber water available."}
{"text":"Great food and service!! Highly recommend the lentil soup!! They even gave us special bread."}
{"text":"The food is great. Very friendly staff. The lamb kabobs were out of this world. Highly recommended. Wish I was living close to come here more often."}
{"text":"Really bad service at this place. I came in during lunchtime, and it was completely empty, but fully staffed with 4 people.  I ordered their lunch special salad with salmon (simple, right?)  I watched them fill a catering order, fill up the display case, clean, chit chat, and do things in the back, while I waited literally 20 MINUTES for my salad.   Plus, they seemed so disoriented and lethargic trying to put together one catering order!!!  Since I was the only person sitting in there waiting to eat, you'd think they'd throw together the lettuce and salmon in a relatively timely manner. I even had to check on the salad!   The food: The salad was ok. Dressing was bland. They give you a big piece of salmon, but it's covered with a thick minced garlic paste. I would never go back here, and I don't recommend it.   I honestly don't understand how this place an average of 4 stars. What a dive."}
{"text":"Placed an order from postmates and it's my first time trying this place and I love it! I ordered their mixed plate and the meat is juicy and seasoned perfectly. Only thing is they forgot my pita pocket bread in my order!"}
{"text":"This place opened in my neighborhood around September and I finally decided to give it a try . When I was in the Army in Germany , we would go to Crete , Greece every year for training and would eat lots of Greek / Mediterranean food especially the Lamb Gyros . My son and I usually go to Gyro Tyme for those , but they close early and we work late .   I came in at 7:30 pm to place order to go . There was one guy waiting for his order . I ordered the Chicken Soltani Kabob plate and a Lamb Shawarma Sandwich . There were two ladies working to counter and later I saw another lady come from the back . One must have been new because you could tell she needed lots of help . Two men came in after me and sat down after ordering , then another man who came by himself , then another for a takeout . The two men got their bowl , then the one man got his plate and the lady looked at me and said mine was almost done . They then gave the other his takeout . 30 minutes and I finally got my food . When I got home , my son and I shared the food .   The rice was very good , the chicken barg was good but not the ground chicken , and then the lamb . The lamb was overcooked and tough and I mean tough . The pita was very thick also . It came with a salad with the plate and fries with the sandwich . Total was $29.09 which was a little much and we didn't even eat much of the sandwich , just threw it away and ate the chicken and rice . Needless to say we won't be coming back which is unfortunate since it is so near to us . If I ever do go back I will just get the Chicken Barg Kabob bowl ."}
{"text":"To expensive , and small portion (  Chill cheese Sandwich.  Half of what other restaurants make."}
{"text":"Great food! We visited the restaurant in April and have been meaning to post something since we were favorably impressed. At first, we were a little put off by the prices that seemed higher than in our neck of the woods (on the other side of the 15). However, we were pleasantly surprised by the ample portions and the very fresh taste. We ordered the kabob plate and really enjoyed them and the salad was amazing. We definitely left feeling like we had enough food after sharing one meal. We also enjoyed sitting out on the patio (the music was a little loud for us inside)."}
{"text":"Got the beef schwarma plate, portion was huge and everything was delicious, the beef, rice and salad, love all of the Persian spices... Will be back"}
{"text":"After hearing such great things about Chickpeas, I decided to order lunch for myself and a couple of people at work.   First, I can say there is no such thing as a SMALL at chickpeas.  Their servings size is great because - well - who doesn't love GREAT hummus?  And it was GREAT.  Perfect blend of chickpeas, tahini, lemon and garlic.   I really wanted a Mazza lunch platter and 2 kebobs but found out from the web site I could not order that.  I was bummed so I ordered a Greek Salad with chicken and the Mazza and shared.  More than enough food for 3-4 people.   The only thing they can maybe take away from me is I would love the option of a Mazza with 2 kebobs."}
{"text":"Very nice place. Babaganush is a blast. Fast and friendly service. Easy to find and park."}
{"text":"Delicious falafel wrap. Bigger portion than I expected. I will be back for sure. The owner or whoever helped me was really nice and helpful."}
{"text":"Pretty good the kabobs don't give much variety but the service is friendly and food is good and definitely a lot for the price you pay didn't give it a 5 because it took a long time to get the food and the lack of variety in some of the dishes which is kinda me being picky I guess but I recommend this place if you want your bang for your and the shawarma is probably the best dish you get a salad rice and the choice of meat so you don't get tired of just the meat and rice not to mention the plate/bowl portions are huge."}
{"text":"Food is pretty good.   I have been there 3 times and all 3 times the service was terrible.  They aren't very friendly either."}
{"text":"I eat here almost everyday for lunch on the lovely patio with my dog, this place is amazing."}
{"text":"After seeing their flyer and procrastinating every day since I finally decided to try it and I'm absolutely in love with this place. Their food is delicious and I love the ambience and their music. I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Always a grear experience. Most of my busienss meeting are at this place. Love the food and people."}
{"text":"Awesome Persian restaurant in my neighborhood.  Very fresh and authentic! Come here for a healthy bite to eat!  Excellent salads, kubideh, and kabobs"}
{"text":"So decided to come check out the lunch special here at Chickpeas Mediterranean Cafe. I loved mediterranean food plus never been so bonus review material. I ended up getting the ground chicken kabob special. Talk about getting thrown for loop when I got my food. I was thinking chicken on skewer. Or for the most part all the times I have had Mediterranean food that use to. The cut of chicken may vary but it looks like chicken. Not that this kabob does not have chicken. IT does just grounded up mixed with have no idea. It form like long stick length just like kabob (no skewer deal with....plus). Odd. The flavor be honest not that bad. It nice moist, taste like chicken, and just different approach. The salad that comes with it refreshing basic salad greens tossed with house dressing. I like the fact it hearty with cucumbers, red onions, and couple nice roasted roma tomato. The rice pilaf is cooked perfect. It just plain rice not seasoned just fyi. The amount of food you get for lunch special it awesome deal! I know for under ten dollars even with drink walked out full.   The inside is much nicer then the outside or that little shopping mall. The tables and chairs are really nice. Not what I expect of small restaurant in small shopping mall. They have nice little outdoor patio with plants around and nice outdoor weather great spot for lunch or dinner. Inside they have one nice widescreen that can watch your favorite game or am sure you can ask change the channel. The kitchen is open kitchen so if want entertainment while waiting right there. They even deliver but do charge $3-5 depending on the miles away.   Not sure if was the owner but one of the guys in the back handed out samples of two different hummus. One was yellow and the other red. Not sure if they plan on putting it on the menu or could have been on the menu. Honestly just had my focus on the lunch specials. lol!! It was nice of the guy hand out little dixie cup samples. The yellow not fan but the red was really good. Hopefully the next time go back they have it on the menu. The whole staff was awesome. The gentlemen took my order to the guy handed out the sample and ask make sure give him feedback. I love that about small business owners. They appreciate customer feedback!!! Worth star by itself!"}
{"text":"I ordered delivery, It arrived after 70 minutes  (On the phone they didn't told me they have high volume of orders) Ok well I'm ok with the long wait but the food arrived cold and the falafel was so dry and it was the worst I ever had :( they put a sauce on it I waist they had it on the side and not all over the falafel... The beef kabob was ok The chicken kabob was not ready on the inside I had to throw it... I hate to leave this review but I really had a bad experience here...I won't order again"}
{"text":"I ordered delivery from them, they gave me the wrong sandwich. I called up and told them and they said they changed the sandwich and hung up on me. Didn't reimburse me or correct it. I Ordered the lamb sandwich which came on a tortilla and got a beef gyro on a pita bread no lamb insight. So I call my bank and have them take the charge off as they didn't want to help and gave me the wrong services.  I then start getting random charges on my bank card not from me. I had to give the lady my credit card info over the phone to order my food delivery. My bank account is a new account, hasn't had any charges on it and they blessed it with it's first one...   Do I need to say more about this place? Please don't order from them any delivery, go in store instead or use a food service so you don't get a wrong order and they don't get your card info."}
{"text":"Everything here is fresh and delicious! I've had the kabob plates, falafel, and salad, each one top quality! Support this business :)"}
{"text":"Cute place-easy to access and plenty of parking cuz the strip mall used to be an Albertson's that has since been closed. Portions are huge! An order would easily satisfy two people.  Everything was fresh made to order and while you are waiting while they cook your order, you're given a lovely house salad filled with tomatoes and cucumbers lately drizzled with olive oil and sesame oil (?)...yummy! Recommend this cute corner for lunch or dinner. Either way-you'll have leftovers to enjoy later."}
{"text":"Great service! Owner and workers were very friendly. I asked for a hot tea and they gave it for free   We got hummus, chicken soltani kabob and lentil soup. They were all good and big portion."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I really enjoy quality mid east food and this place is probably one of the best.Clean, Good Service, generous portion, price ok, we will definetly be back often for this delicious lamb we had!"}
{"text":"Love this place! Came here to eat with my mom and the employee was helpful with guiding us on what to order. They also have an outdoor seating that is great!"}
{"text":"So good!  The portions are amazing, the \"secret oil\" was awesomely addictive. I would seriously out it on everything. The meat was grilled perfectly, the rice was not dry, every flavor complimented the other. Service was fabulous. We will be visiting again."}
{"text":"Food: Love the ground chicken and steak combo. Comes with charred tomato, side salad and rice. If you order delivery that's over $10 you get free small hummus and pita bread! Their pita bread is so thick and fluffy.   Delivery: always fast and food comes before set delivery time. I have ordered delivery twice and both drivers were extremely nice. Food arrives warm and still fresh. Also free delivery!!   Overall I highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"Great food, generous portions, and very friendly staff. The food came out piping hot and fresh. This was my first time here, but I certainly plan on coming back."}
{"text":"The food was good although 14$ for a kabob plate with only one portion of protein is a bit much. As for the desserts; this is not a napoleon cake."}
{"text":"The chicken shawarma Greek salad for lunch. It's HUGE! And totally delicious! Customer service was on point! Zero complaints from me. Very close to where I work, I will be back!"}
{"text":"Just placed an order on uber eats for the tabouli salad with chicken. They don't offer the option of the shirazi sales with meat but the salad is the same base price as the tabouli salad. So I asked if they could give me some of the shirazi with my chicken. They did not respond and just completed my order without caring at all about that request."}
{"text":"Had lunch here for the first time today.   They have a different range of dishes than other Mediterranean restaurants in the neighborhood.  The tabouli with the addition of chicken shawarma was very tasty.  They brought warm pita to the table as well.  It looks like it is a family run joint, which I like to support.   I will be back."}
{"text":"Excellent restaurant in a run down shopping center, hidden somewhat. Great food and nice people if inexperienced service, family owned. Ordered breakfast: Denver omelette, pancakes, chicken schwarma platter, Turkish coffee and fatoush salad with beef schwarma. Very traditional and healthy. Roast potatoes are wonderful."}
{"text":"Never had Mediterranean food before and this place had very good food. Alex gave me and my sister great service! We are definitely gonna go back again soon!"}
{"text":"I ordered the following:  1 Mazza platter  2 chicken barg lunch special   The falafel in the platter was very good as well as the hummus. I have had better baba ghanoush; but taste is subjective. The bread is very tasty as well and is similar to Lebanese bread or pita.    For the lunch special the portion size is well worth the money. The rice is good and the chicken is very tender and well flavored. The lunch special also comes with a standard side salad. I just wish a different vinaigrette was offered besides balsamic. Perhaps a pomegranate molasses dressing would be a bit more tasty and compliment the chicken.   Overall, chickpeas is worth trying. I will be back to try their koobideh."}
{"text":"I love this place!! The hummus is so fresh and tasty. Most of everything I've tried is delicious and flavorful! The also cater and do a great presentation!! I highly recommend it!"}
{"text":"My first time here.  Ordered the falafel plate, huge serving!  Salad was very fresh, crunchy cukes and lettuce, firm but juicy tomatoes.  Love beets, too!  Falafel was gritty outside and soft inside.  Found out why the inside had a green color just by asking.  Nice! Guessed what that flavor was in the salad dressing!  Decidedly Asian!  Their cucumber water in a jar was the perfect antidote for today's 104 degree heat.  I was given the wrong directions so there was some frustration getting to the right corner.  Cost them one star.  Patio was inviting, have to try when temps cool down.  Will be back!"}
{"text":"We had a dinner after our convention prepared by Chick Pea. It was a great spread of items. The salad and dressing were excellent. The meats, rice, grilled tomatoes and humis, tziki sauce and bread were mouthwatering. Come check them out.  Great food"}
{"text":"WAOW NOMS  I've never had shawarma. 5/7 perfect score. Super clean everything. Food was on point. Super friendly service. Kind of slow but it seemed like lunch rush and they were working a catering project. ¯\_(?)_/¯ will be back"}
{"text":"Didn't really live up to the hype on here. The ordering for delivery process was a hot mess. The dude was so willing to give me anything I wanted that he must of not realized I didn't know what there was to give. This review is based on a delivery so it might differ is we were in house. The food took about an hour (not complaining) but what we received was less than ideal. I got the falafel sandwich combo. The fries were dreadful and my goal was to put them In the sandwich but they went straight to the trash, they were both soggy and some how mushed ( I really hate mashed potatoes) the falafel were dry as hell and tasted almost too much of cinnamon. There were four huge balls but it was so much to get threw I gave up after 1/4 of the way, basic veggies were throne inside and not even seasoned. This was one of the weirded falafel sandwich I've ever had, also tasted like they had been sitting, not freshly fried, no crisp just mush.  My friend got the beef shawarma sandwich, he just ate the mashed potato fries, but when he took a bite of the sandwich he spat it out and claimed it was all gristle. I don't like looking at other people's chewed up food but it seemed like there was no beef on his sandwich but just fat, he got all the veggies on the side and took some olive oil and balsamic and made a salad. Smart man, all in all I couldn't recommend eating at this place to go and probably won't go back but maybe if I'm desperate?"}
{"text":"Okay--  best falafel I've ever eaten.  Hands down.  The fresh pita bread is fantastic.  I'm in love with the lamb.  Is it too much to want it for every meal??"}
{"text":"Terrible experience in delivery. They didn't send me a salad I ordered and then didn't kniw how to refund. Took me 15 minutes to try and get an answer. Still don't know if I'll get the refund. Can't tell you about the food yet, order wasn't right so I haven't been able to eat it"}
{"text":"Unbelievably great value delicious food friendly service I would highly recommend this to those looking for vegan- vegetarian friendly food in Las Vegas"}
{"text":"Had the beef,  number 25, simply perfect.  The rice is done so well,  and I've had a lot of rice being half Filipino.  The sauce supplied at the table is great to go with the food option,  reminds me of some kind of soy sauce,  but better. The manager welcomed me and helped me kindly with my food options,  definitely can recommend this place."}
{"text":"Fresh food and very generous portion. One of the best Mediterranean food place around the area"}
{"text":"Delicious food. And my husband ordered take out for his staff. The orange hummus was delicious as was the rice and chicken kabob and the salad. Can't wait to try shawarma and cucumber dip."}
{"text":"This was my first time eating a ground chicken kabob and it was absolutely delicious! I had my meal there and they served me their house salad to start. If you like tangy light dressing, this dressing is for you! I want a bottle of it to take home! Once my kabob came out, I was shocked to see how much food was it n the plate. The kabobs were juicy and flavorful. There was yellow and white rice...I'm Asian so I'm used up the heavy starchy calories rice, but this was so good, I'd like to eat more. Finally...I don't usually eat tomatoes in general, and having them grilled to be eaten doesn't really appeal to me either, but I figured I'd try! And man...I'm glad I did! I took a piece of the tomato, a piece of my kabob, and a little rice and it made for the perfect combo! Now...all they need to do is have a location in Henderson and I should be set! I'd go there all the time!"}
{"text":"I ordered the beef kabob plate for lunch and an iced coffee. The photo of the iced coffee was an iced coffee mixed with milk I assumed it would be like that but when I received my iced coffee it was just black coffee with ice. I think they should change the picture. The food was okay,The hummus was super yummy!  Also I received a lot of condiments but nothing was labeled. I would have liked to know what it was.  I ended up pouring  milk on my plate thinking it was sauce. This place might be better to eat at then to order from."}
{"text":"I haven't ordered bad delivery in Las Vegas in a very long time. This was outstandingly bad. I covered enough of the menu with my order to know I would be out of my mind to ever try this place again. We'll start with the worst first.   Lamb shank: straight to the trash you go. The lamb tasted very old, rubbery, dry and gamey. To make the dish even worse, they included rice that was seasoned so heavily it was like someone mowed a lawn and dumped it in their rice cooker. (How can a restaurant screw up rice?!?!)  Chicken Wing Kabob: the menu said it was \"marinated\"... I have strong doubts. There was little flavor and the meat was very overcooked. Far below average, do not recommend.   Lamb Pizza: I picked off the lamb after my encounter with the lamb shank and just ate the cheese and bread. It was acceptable.   Greek Salad: So close to passable. The vegetables were fresh unfortunately, they didn't peel off the outer layer of the onion so I got to take out the skin before eating. Maybe they got busy?  After tasting kabob, salad, lamb and pizza I have to give this restaurant two stars. They did well on the bread and the staff was friendly, but a good meal is more than cheese and bread. Hopefully they can improve the dishes or change the chef."}
{"text":"Love the food here, the prices, the portions.  This is a great restaurant!  Can you please tell me when you stop airing Fox News, as my husband swore he'd never return after seeing it on your TV.  And I'd really, really, really like to return.  Thanks!"}
{"text":"Restaurant is cute and has a modern design. Customer service is great. We tried the shawarma plate - lots of food for a reasonable price. The food was a little bland though. They also service breakfast, definitely want to come back and try something else out."}
{"text":"This place is AWFUL, i had their Shawarma it was dry and inedible. the pita bread was stale and hard (I was afraid it was moldy)  I took my order to go, and threw it in the trash."}
{"text":"Fantastic experience   I love a good Mediterranean restaurant and this establishment does NOT disappoint. To start the location is easy to access and has ample parking. The menu is very easy to order from and there is something for everyone. The staff is super friendly and makes the counter order service feel like an experience from start to finish.  The beef is tender, the rice is full of flavor, and the hot tea is phenomenal!  This is a must try restaurant and worth the drive if it is not a close to you."}
{"text":"It was very delicious, the staff was extremely kind. The salad that comes with the dinner plates is DELICIOUS you MUST try the house made balsamic vinegar with it as well as their red pepper hot sauce with their meats. You can tell the meat was great quality and you can watch it being made with care right when you're ordering! I truly enjoyed this meal !"}
{"text":"They give you a MASSIVE amount of food when you order the shawarma plate (enough that I either split it with someone or get a box to go)... it's delicious and only $10. Cheap, friendly, and delicious"}
{"text":"Pretty big portions. Not too expensive, and it's worth the coin. Good eats.  Friendly staff."}
{"text":"We have eaten at Chickpeas before, enjoying the cafe itself. Tonight we wanted to take food out as we have a guest from out of town. I was shown the family platter: kebabs, rice, salad, hummus, and pita bread are included.  I went to pick up my bag, and said, \"Thanks so much!\" The staff said: \"Wait: you have another bag!!\" Well, how crazy was that: I had two bags of platters to carry. It seemed enough for a small wedding!  We had great fresh bread, hummus, mixed kebabs of beef and chicken, roasted tomatoes, fresh salad and rice.  For $35. we have sufficient food for two meals each for 3 people!!"}
{"text":"Mazza platter and lentil soup, delivered quickly and it was so much food!  I can also say that it was packaged and prepared nicely, the food is beautiful and seasoned well. I like the spices in the lentil soup and the salads are fresh. Falafel has a crispy outside and tender inside.  I promise I'm picky, but I definitely recommend!"}
{"text":"This place is excellent! The food is fresh, delicious, with ample portions and ridiculously affordable prices. The only drawback is that sometimes the place is too cold to dine in so we get take out. Highly recommended"}
{"text":"Wow! Definitely the BEST Mediterranean food I've had in Vegas, and I have really tried a lot of places! I got the Lamb Barg and Sultani Kabob, my husband got the Salmon with Sabzi Polo and we shared a plate. Best lamb in town! Small place on the corner of Flamingo and Jones with a nice outside sitting area. Fresh baked bread on site and falafels are made from chickpeas and Lima beans that are not from cans. I am so pleased with this food, good portion size...can definitely take home leftovers."}
{"text":"We went here by chance when the Shish Kabob House was too busy to seat us. It is a few blocks away. This is more of a fast food place than a sit down restaurant. They do a big carry-out business. The prices are reasonable and the portions are too big. We ordered 2 lamb shawarma plates, the meat was plentiful but burned. The cook was too busy taking orders and talking to customers to pay attention to the food. The tabouli salad was a big disappointment. There was hardly any tabouli, it was all parsley. We ordered a medium and it was enormous. No one ate more than a few bites. The cook made a mistake on our friends order and he didn't get his food until everyone else was finished. They have some great lunch specials. I would still give this place another chance but order something else."}
{"text":"Ordered delivery Sunday evening , lamb shawarma was cold and the pita bread was dry..Very disappointing wouldn't order again"}
{"text":"I tried this place for the first time last week. The chicken was great however they give you way too much rice and not enough chicken and the price is to high. I would go back when I have when I win the California Lotto..lol"}
{"text":"I order the family platter all the time it's delicious and great for 4-5 people. I'm so pleased with this place order is on point every time I ordered. However, I ordered the wrong thing and they were so sweet even though it was my fault they worked with me and fixed it. Also, they have yummy Curry hummus that comes for free with the family platter. This restaurant is awesome, and I order from them every weekend for us family of 4. Chickpeas restaurant is appreciated I will add photos next time I order."}
{"text":"Super healthy food, very generous portions. Lovely atmosphere with cool air in the summer and a gorgeous patio if the weather is nice. Friendly staff and owner is awesome =) love coming here for lunch."}
{"text":"Mediterranean food is not cheap, so don't come looking for a five dollar value meal. Having said that it is affordable . For example chicken shawarma sandwich is $6.95 What sets this place above the rest for me is the customer service. Friendly and polite. When the barista was gone and I wanted a cappuccino they offered me plain brewed coffee for free. Then when the barista returned I got the cappuccino also for free. I ordered a tzatziki dip with pita . When I finished the pita and still had more dip left they offered more free pita. Then before I left the manager or owner came and asked if I would like to try a vegetarian dish called Kuku. Wow. All this service . I will gladly be back"}
{"text":"This place was so good & their food was freshly made. Their salad was one of the best I've had in a long time.  I love that the dining area was casual and open !"}
{"text":"2.5 Stars...  Walking in and choosing a place to sit, I couldn't help but notice that it is fairly unkept in here. Tables were a bit dirty and chairs were scattered about.   The service was friendly but didn't seem to be familiar with the menu. As for the food, I ordered the chicken and beef kabobs- $18 for two kabobs, plain white rice (where's the flavored rice?!) and grilled tomatoes. The flavors were OK.   I don't think I would come back though...."}
{"text":"Awesome service!! Good suggestion from the hispanic girl at the cashier!! Food is big portions!! OMG very good lamb . I will comeback for sure, the place is very clean and nice ambient"}
{"text":"Pros:  -Menu is easy to read  -The guy that took the order was really nice  -Very clean facility  Cons:  -Took a long time to get our food  -Chicken was bland  -Lamb was way too salty  -Salad and hummus were also very bland"}
{"text":"So... I have always ordered from Shawarma House, more so due to proximity and convenience than anything else. Fast forward to Black Friday, Shawarma House chose to close on this day; I wanted kabobs, so now here we are... given the distance between Chickpeas Café and my house, (11.5 miles), you'll understand why I was hesitant. There is little worse than cold lamb chops made to travel 30 minutes while their hummus compatriot does the opposite and gets too warm to be trustworthy. I was SO pleasantly surprised! Not only were our lamb chops and kofte delicious, they were cooked to temp per our request, and made it to my house hot and perfect. What we got for my hard earned bucks was well worth it, and the hummus was outstanding! Just the right amount of tahini, lemon, and garlic; simply yummy! AND our delivery guy was sweet, respectful, and very, very professional. Chickpeas is a win all the way, we will be back   Just one note... A little extra Pita bread is always a good thing"}
{"text":"Pizza from here is legit. Needed something good for the family and this place nailed it. Cant beat Extra rice, bread and humus. Healthy portions make every one happy."}
{"text":"The menu is a bit abbreviated but the quality of the food here is excellent. In addition, the portions are decent for the price.  The interior is very clean and the layout is very modern. Service is friendly and the smells and sights when you enter are very enticing.  I ordered to-go during my visit but would definitely be interested in returning and dining in."}
{"text":"I tried this place last time I was in Vegas It's small inside but nice. The outdoor area needs some updating but it was clean inside the food was good and the employees were nice"}
{"text":"Awesome deal on this beautiful plant based meal! Healthy and fresh! I couldn't eat it all! The helpful and kind staff rounded out the experience. I will be back!"}
{"text":"Had the ground chicken kabob dish. It was hard to eat it all. It had no flavor and it wasn't cooked all the way. I had to throw half of it away couldn't keep it down.  I have to try something else if I ever decide to go back."}
{"text":"This place was great!!! Best falafel I've ever had and that's saying something since I'm a vegetarian and try it everywhere! Beautiful and clean inside as well. Would definitely recommend it! All 3 of us had something different and it was all very good!!!"}
{"text":"Great little find in Spring Valley.  I've driven past hundreds of times and finally decided to stop in for lunch. Very comfortable environment, nice patio and plenty of parking.  Friendly staff and quick, efficient service.  Enjoyed a very good Falafel sandwich and perhaps the best Baba Ganoush on the planet . . . do not miss it! Backlava is also outstanding.   Certainly seems as though just about everything is made in house . . . and it shows. Good portion sizes and very reasonably priced.  Lots of vegetarian options as well.  No beer & wine . . . a bit of in an issue for me.  But they said that I could bring my own next time. Looking forward to returning soon!"}
{"text":"As most Mediterranean joints go now days in Las Vegas, Chickpeas is a deli counter \"fast food\" experience but the food is extremely fresh and prepared right in front of you over hot coals and by a friendly staff who take pride in the food they provide.  I selected the beef kabob and the chicken combo plate to take home. Everything was perfect and the simplicity of the dishes made it that much more enjoyable. This is a great option for anyone looking for a good kabob fix, or any other Mediterranean classic."}
{"text":"The hummus and pita bread is incredible. Plus the dressing on the table will change your life."}
{"text":"If you're hungry, this is a great place to go. Not only is their menu got a lot of choices, but their portion sizes are gigantic. Literally, the chicken schwarma bowl my gf got was three meals worth of food. The food itself is decent. Not the tastiest but also not bland. I tried a beef kabob which was okay. It really begged for more variety, but it is a relatively simple plate. It still came with a huge mound of rice.   The chicken schwarma was tasty when mixed with sauce and rice. They have very tender chicken but I'm not a huge fan of the rice style, but that might just be me.  The staff was friendly, but the service was honestly a bit slow. While the fresh salad was a good way to hold me over, I was getting a little impatient by the time we got our food. I'd say it was a good 15 minutes after the salads.  Prices here are very good for the amount of food received. I'll definitely be back to try some of the more premium kabobs."}
{"text":"Horrible food, old rice from few days old. The owner seems like he doesn't give a care about what's going on in his restaurant. Avoid going to this place and try other Halal restaurants. This place is just Terrible, second time was even the worst experience. Avoid at all costs. They have a receptionist that cannot even understand English and messes up the order. She is using the same gloves to give silver ware, food, bread, and with same gloves taking cash and taking payment and working the grill and handling uncooked meat!!"}
{"text":"Another great meal at Chickpeas!  Delicious Salmon and Green Rice dish and Falafel plate! Their salad was excellent and the prices are very reasonable! Don't miss this place; what a great meal!"}
{"text":"Food was ok. But I'm writing about the delivery. Holy cow! Took 1 hour to deliver 4 blocks. When she got here, asked if I needed change( I presume for a tip) good thing I didn't, got back to to room and a quarter of the order was missing . Cmon. Called back immediately and was hung up on the first time. Called back a second time and was told they are sending the driver back with the rest of the order. Fast forward 30min and the rest of the order still not here. I called back and asked for a refund on the items we did not receive. Not fun with 2 hungry kids at a hotel with no RESTERAUNT ."}
{"text":"This place AMAZING! Excellent food, great decor and even better service. Met the owner and he is truly interested in having repeat customers. I had the mixed plate chicken and beef kabob with the rice and salad. I will definitely be back with friends!"}
{"text":"Great Mediterranean food. Lively music, personable manager. They make their own bread, 3 kinds! Nice staff."}
{"text":"The store was clean, the food was great and the staff was excellent.  I look forward to coming back and trying more of the menu."}
{"text":"Authentic middle eastern restaurant. Good quality food and they even have sour yogurt here!!"}
{"text":"Awesome place for post workout meal or even just anything time of day at all. The only thing I would hope they include is the nutrition facts this could be great for athletes to come by and check out.  I'll give this five stars when they appear on my fitness pal."}
{"text":"I am sick of shshikabob house.  Their meat is getting smaller and smaller everytime  I go there and the service for delivery  is not getting  any better  I decided to try a new Mediterranean  place called chickpeas. Very nice inside and everyone is very friendly. The portion is so big  it  made me laugh. The salad comes with my falafel(7.95) is bigger than normal dinner salad I order at a regular restaurants. Their own house dressing is delicious. I ordered falafel. Perfectly  cooked. Crispy outside and soft inside. I would recommen this place. Oh and the coffee  is very good as well if you like strong coffee."}
{"text":"I love coming to this place because the service is top notch and they have great vegan options. The environment is super chill and relaxed and the employees all deliver a high level of service. They also have a big Vizio T.V. with live sports. I'm looking forward for the outside hookah lounge to open to enjoy some good times and great food with friends. Shout out also to the manager Alex for creating a great environment and for having a world class crew!"}
{"text":"I must say that was a great experience their food is awesome their customer service is 1 million us know how to treat customers right away I didn't ask for much but they gave me so much food was unbelievable I would DEFINITELY well recommend them to my friends and family this is my second time coming the last two days to the restaurant it's awesome"}
{"text":"My husband and I have frequented Chickpeas about once a week for the past couple of months. Here is fresh, honest, tasty food that is exceptionally well priced. Our favorites include the Mezza plate and lamb Barq platter. And the pita is made on the premises. It's  definitely one of Vegas' best secrets!!!!!"}
{"text":"Awesome. We came in late at 8:30pm. Even at the end of the day. Salad was still fresh and crisp. Food came fast. Owner was hands on. I respect that. Prices are reasonable."}
{"text":"The food here was so good! The portions were huge, so bring your appetite. The baba ghanoush was absolutely delicious. The Greek salad was gigantic. Everything was so fresh and delicious. The lamb was really tasty. The service was great too. I wish there was one closer to my side of town, but I'll definitely be back here. Did I mention the baklava???"}
{"text":"Place is super cute and the food was great! Bummed that they ran out of the burger meat so I wasn't able to get that. I ordered the hummus, lentil soup, and falafel wrap. They informed me that they are also out of falafel. I was thinking of scratching the whole order but someone from the back came and said they'll be able to make more but it'll take a bit, I was totally fine with that. Overall very friendly staff and great business. I will be coming back for that burger!"}
{"text":"Had really high hopes after reading the reviews. The smell in the restaurant was enticing. After returning and opening up the packages, the portions are extremely large. I'm assuming that's why people give such high marks on the reviews. After reading that the pizza is the most highly rated item on the menu, I should've known. The hummus, chicken shawarma, tzaziki, and tahini all lack flavor and seasoning. The shawarma is cooked to a leathery complexion with the consistency of a well worn shoe sole. The flavor doesn't come across as being anywhere near authentic. The pita is flat and chewy. The tzaziki tastes like plain yogurt. The hummus tasted like there was little to no seasoning in it. If a Mediterranean restaurant that names itself after hummus' main ingredient, it should be delicious, if not servicable. The falafel was tasty and the lentil soup was decent, so there's that. If you want Greek food that is always dependable and delicious, The Fat Greek is just one street over."}
{"text":"$7.95 lunch specials with a lot of salmon options? Damn, can't really beat that. Quick service and friendly as can be too. New go to lunch place when my coworkers are not down for Chinatown."}
{"text":"This is probably the worst \"shawarma\" place in Las Vegas The meat was old and seemed to have been cooked a couple of days before. Will never go back there again....period"}
{"text":"This place is fantastic. Squeaky clean kitchen, dining area and bathrooms. Food was fresh and hot. Had the ground chicken kabobs and it did not disappoint. Salad dressing was perfect: not too tangy and not too sweet. Good value for the price."}
{"text":"Nice place with friendly stuf. Big choice of food and good choice of vegeterian and vegan choicea. They have kabab but i didn't try. I had vegeterian sandwich and salad wich was very tasty and my husband had chicken with rice but it come with salad inside. Chicken was huge he couldn't finish it. I am giving a for star because of the desert. I took baklava which was price around 3-4 $ and there is no walnuts in baklava just cinamon. It was so weird. They put a little bit of pictacio on the top but mainly you can taste cinamon which was so weird. Baklav with cinamon???? But everything else was nice. Friendly stuff and they also have outside seating"}
{"text":"This is another hidden gem in Vegas! I am not sure if this is a family run business or not... but it feels like it is in the Best Way! They are all so friendly and welcoming that you want to come back for that reason alone. But don't worry their food is also amazing and cooked right in front of you. It doesn't matter if you're a Mediterranean junkie or its your first time ever experiencing these delightful dishes, they take the time to explain everything to you. One of the nicest things they do, that 99% of restaurants don't do, is serve you a complimentary drink and or salad while you're waiting. They do this even when you order  takeout. Top Notch Customer Service! Its a small, brand new restaurant, on the corner of a strip mall. Their meets aren't dry or overcooked! They're moist and flavorful. Their rice is always cooked to perfection and even the vegetables seem larger and fresher then most restaurants! Can't find a single thing to say bad about the place. The only thing I wish they had was an outdoor fireplace or pit. It would be nice to be able to sit out on their patio when it's cold."}
{"text":"Very very very testy and delicious food , all types all kinds of food and drinks , the staff all are great and  wry polite especially the supervisor Alex, the most exiting food is the Iraqi bred ( Samoon Hajary) , i have been here in LV for the last three days suffering to find any resultant with Halal ratable food but unfortunately nothing , this is the only restaurant really i love , i will keep eating in this restaurant for ever also im recommend everyone to try any type of food here.  Thanks to all the team especially Alex , in addition of all that they have free Wifi and free parking ,  Thanks again and Regards, KC"}
{"text":"As a Vegas local I highly recommend this restaurant!!! This place has some of the best Mediterranean food We've had in town and also great portions and value.    Super delicious, you can tell that they put love in their product.    Yummy!!!"}
{"text":"This is by far my favorite Mediterranean restaurant. Excellent food, very fresh and very good service. People are friendly and cheerful."}
{"text":"Stumbled on this place as I was driving on Jones, and I'm glad I did! Food was fresh, hot, and delicious! It didn't take them long at all to get the food out. Had the shawarma plate and the Tabuli salad... It was all fresh and very reasonably priced for the amount of food you get! I do wish they had the garlic sauce for the chicken that other Mediterranean places have, that's really the only draw back."}
{"text":"This was our first time trying this place out and we were pleasantly surprised.!! The portions were huge and the food was so clean and tasty :) We will surely be back again."}
{"text":"Vegetarian dishes I had seemed just ok. restaurant environment was open and pretty nice, and selection was very good. I had falafel salad, hummus, and dolme. Dolme was good, falafel was different but not unpleasant, salad was bland. I did not enjoy the hummus, and some of the bread was a bit stale."}
{"text":"We were in town for a convention and I had Alex / Chickpeas supply our event with a couple of their substantial app plates.  Superb quality and customer support.  We had a hang-up (entirely my fault) on where in our huge hotel Alex needed to drop off the food.  He was in the right place / entrance, per my instructions, but I couldn't find it from within the hotel!  It was eventually sorted out, and again the food was excellent.  Super fresh and flavorful.  Alex, thank you again!"}
{"text":"Have been coming here for awhile during lunch breaks.  Great lunch menu for very reasonable prices, good food, and friendly staff.     Surprised at some of the recent bad reviews.  Don't listen to the naysayers - Give em' a try."}
{"text":"Good food,  good decor,  very clean and comfortable environment.  Would recommend for something quick'ish was hoping for some hummus with my dish for the price but,  not an issue."}
{"text":"Went to a fairly late lunch there and in their defense their they were probably busy. Decent service and nice staff.  The food was mediocre - I got the beef shawarma sandwich and by sandwich i mean in a wrap. I literally had to dig for the beef. it was 98% salad 2% meat. and their salad was bland, limp and tasteless. I even deconstructed and poured tzatziki all over it. didn't help.  My lunch date had the Lamb Shawarma. He let me try the rice which i thought was the best of what we ordered.  The portion on the plate was large again mostly the salad and the rice though you could see his lamb.   Phat Phriendly:  Inside comfortable seating. They have a lovely patio that comes with a HUGE honking warning sign - Furniture only holds up to 200lbs. Sit at your own risk. guess that cleared that up. I couldn't help but stare as there was a cute guy with a very cute dog on the patio. looked like the dog weighed 200lbs.   We'll try something else there going by my 3 times rule - maybe the babaganoush since everyone here seems to like it."}
{"text":"Food was amazing. Fast, friendly, and comfortable restaurant. This is a must go if you at all enjoy Mediterranean food.   Owner is friendly and the service was wonderful.   Thanks do a great value for the price."}
{"text":"This was place was da absolute BOMB!!! From the customer service to the chefs.  The food was healthy snd the best we've tasted here in Vegas.  We're def coming back!!!  Love this place."}
{"text":"Order on UberEats and all of our orders got mixed up and one order was completely wrong. Food was ok. Overpriced for what we received."}
{"text":"Our large family was really hungry and driving by, and we stopped here because it was close and had good reviews. Yelpers are not always to be trusted in their reviews, but this place deserves the high marks.  We had the tabouli, shirazi, cucumber salads, baba ganouj, hummus, tzatziki, kash-k-bademjan, as part of two Mazza plates.   This was followed by several kabob dishes that we shared: ground beef, ground chicken, chicken  breast, and filet of beef kabob.  All dishes were freshly prepared on the grill in front of our eyes. We ate heartily, and took home leftovers, as portions are large. The meats were all tender and juicy, even the chicken breast.  Starters all are made in house and fresh (we asked). Recipes are simple and authentic. Nothing tastes pre-made or frozen here. We didn't try the pizza, but they have a legit wood stone oven like I've seen in some high end restaurants.  The place is kept clean, not like the dingy middle eastern places I'm used to. The menu is displayed on large monitors, iPad based payment system that is modern.  I think Chick peas is worth the drive even if you don't live on this side of town because they use fresh, high quality ingredients at a budget price. We'll be back."}
{"text":"My friend recommended this place so my wife & I decided to try it. Place was casual & prices reasonable compared to the other kabob places we go to. Ordered our fave, chicken & beef \"lule\" combo & a side oh hummus. Was recommended by \"Alex\" who took our order when we couldn't decide if to try the Gyro or the lule plate. Food came in fast starting w/ the salad, then hummus w/ pita bread. Have tried hummus in different restaurants before but this one was good. Salad was big portion & their \"own family secret\" dressing blended well with our taste buds. Then came the main dish & wow! Big portions indeed! The meat was juicy & tender & really good. We got excited & texted pics to our adult kids who loves dining out like us & told them to check it out! Alex came over to check on us & mentioned that 2nd location opening in 2-3 weeks which is closer to where we live. In fact, was so satisfied that we plan to take the family & some close friends to celebrate my wife's birthday dinner at the new location (hopefully opened by then). Nice to have a good place to eat & really enjoy good medittarenean cuisine. Cant wait to try their other delicacies"}
{"text":"HUGE HUGE HUGE Portions.  We ordered the Mazza Plate for I think $6 and this could have fed two people easily.  Bread was fresh and warm.  This seems to be a place people order more frequently for delivery and take-out."}
{"text":"I don't eat pizza everywhere and I have to say this pizza was really good! They have a lot of good food here, I wish I could have a little bit of everything! I will stop by again to try their meats, they look delicious."}
{"text":"Best Mediterranean in Vegas! Food was amazing, service is friendly, great looking decor and the prices are more than reasonable. Fantastic!"}
{"text":"Gotta love this place!! Great food  Chicken skewers are my favorite.   The place is really clean and great service. Plus well priced"}
{"text":"To be totally honest, I have been craving Mediterranean food for two weeks. I finally got to this place, which drew me in with a flyer. The lunch specials are huge portions. My family enjoyed the ground chicken more than the beef, but, they are both delish.  The hummus is yummy, too. We added in the spicy oil and it knocked the flavor out of the park. I will be back for this. They have special water, too. My daughter and sister loved it."}
{"text":"Great food ..great service ... very accomodating .. we were a party of 10 we tried most of the dishes  .. everyone was happy with the food .. specially Rack of Lamb was excellent."}
{"text":"I've updated my review because I don't want this incredible place to be downgraded just because it lacks atmosphere.  It does, since it's a counter-order place with some tables, but the quality and quantity of what you get is simply beyond compare.  On our last visit, it seemed that the prices had been lowered.  That, and the absence of diners on a Saturday night, make me think that you'd better get there soon if you want to try it.    Hubby wanted the barley soup he had last time, but they were out of it, so he got lentil instead.  Loved it.    We ordered the mezze platter to start, and could not believe what we got for $6:  good-sized portions of hummus, babaganoush, and tzatziki, along with two falafel, tomato and cucumber salad, tons of olives, and two large stuffed grape leaves.  If we had stopped there, we would have been fine.  We did stop mid-way, because we also had ordered a ground mixed kabob, which came with salad and enough rice to feed all of Monaco.  They brought us two salads, each huge, and with tomatoes that were actually red!  Everything was fresh and delicious.  We took home so much food that we had dinner for two the next night.  That's when we had the grape leaves.  I never could stand them before, but these were incredible.  Before finishing this review, I checked the menu online.  They haven't updated the prices, but they are indeed lower than what they are now.  Don't wait!"}
{"text":"Very clean and modernized restaurant. The food is amazing, and would definitely come back here again. Also, I recommend this place to anyone!"}
{"text":"This is the second time I've ordered from Chickpeas. Very great tasty Mediterranean Food. I typically order the catering for office events. The food is always really fresh and is a crowd pleaser.  They have a lot of options and for vegetarians as well.  This time around I ordered the Baklava for dessert.  So fresh and delicious.  Only reason for 4 stars vs 5 is that they were here 30 minutes early.  Thank goodness we have warmers :) I highly recommend this place 110%."}
{"text":"This restaurant food is so delicious, tasty and fresh. Can't say enough about it. Their food ingredients are really fresh and full of flavor. The staff is friendly and professional. If you really want to have good, big and yamy meal this is the perfect. They have outside tables do you can enjoy the fresh air. Can't say enough about salad addressing it is AMAZING. Im trying to purchase it and I asked the owner to ship it to my address in Pittsburgh and he welcome it. Great team great food and great experience. Definitely worth to visit again."}
{"text":"Great place on my way home for authentic Persian food. Ghormeh Sabzi was good. The chunks of beef were cooked well, seared on the outside and tender in the middle. It was an excellent portion size for the price accompanied by a large plate of saffron rice and a salad. I have a few more dishes in mind to have here.   My original dish I had planned to order was Ghaimeh Bademjan. I was, however, told it was no longer available."}
{"text":"By far the best chicken shawarma I've had in a long time. The chicken wasn't dry and was very flavorful. I love their basmati rice, and I really like their hummus.   They don't skimp you on anything. I spend $15 on chicken shawarma and an iced tea, and this will feed me for the next 2 days. Two people can easily share a single plate.   The only thing is temperature. Although I did get my food delivered, I wish it was a little warm, and the same thing with the pita bread. I needed to heat up everything. I personally like my pita's thinner, but it's a bit difficult to heat up pita bread. So I wish they would have warmed it or wrapped it in foil or something.   Delivery is fast if you don't feel like going in, but they will definitely see me more often!"}
{"text":"Amazing tasting food. The aroma in the place makes you even more hungry when you walk into this place. The owner is extremely thankful for his guests because he tries to remember everyone that comes through this place. I luv the ground beef and the rice is made with luv."}
{"text":"This is a fast, casual restaurant where my wife and I each ordered 2 skewers of grilled ground lamb that were accompanied by Basmati rice, a grilled tomato and salad.  Sounded good to us, but the execution left much to be desired.  The lamb was dry and under seasoned, the Basmati rice plain with the exception of a topping of chopped carrots, the pita was dry and the salad overdressed, but who am I to quibble?"}
{"text":"A friend recommended Chickpeas and I am so glad she did. There were 3 of us in our party. We had the Mazza Plate, Falafel Salad and a Gyro...everything was amazing! This was by far the BEST pita bread I've ever had! All of the food is prepared fresh on site and the staff is very courteous and efficient. We went to the W. Flamingo and Jones location. There is also a new location at Rainbow and Sunset that is closer to our home so we plan on being regulars. FANTASTIC FOOD!!!"}
{"text":"Delivery took more than an hour, messy sandwich and soggy fries with spilled fruit punch or some red fluid on them. Not edible!"}
{"text":"This is my favorite place to eat when I want something fresh and delicious,  my daughter loves it as well. We come here on our mommy daughter days and they help me with her meals cause she has so many allergies.  I love this place."}
{"text":"Wow this food is insane ! I ordered breakfast sandwich and it came out in the Giant foil baking dish and I got free garlicky hummus with my order.The barley soup probably I can eat everyday.Their chicken and rice platter was insane and cucumbers were fresh and crunchy full of juice.They added some dried berries on the rice which was already good and chicken was marinated in yogurt and  other spices  it was earthy and balanced food.Portions are giant except for the soup."}
{"text":"Friends and I were craving kabob and when we typed it on yelped this popped and what caught our eye of course what the five star rating.  When you walk inside, very beautiful, clean and modernize restaurant. Everything from the ceiling to the floors was very well decorated. Their menu is on tv screens and very easy to read and prices was decent.  I ordered the number 27 which was the Beef Filet Soltani Kabob. Whoa when the food arrived I was amazed of how much they serve you. It was totally worth every penny. They also gave us a side of their bread and every bite of our meal was perfect. The presentation of every of our meal was excellent.  We will be coming back again! Thank you to their friendly staff and quick service."}
{"text":"First time here and the food is amazing. Even though we were full we still couldn't help ourselves to keep eating a bit more! Definitely will come back."}
{"text":"Excellent new restaurant! Place is spotless clean and the food is delicious! Ive eaten here every week since the place opened in early Sept, 2015 and I keep coming back for more. I strongly recommend the schwarma plates and kebabs. Meat is always well marinated and tasty. Great quality food in an awesome casual atmosphere. I'll continue eating lunch here!"}
{"text":"Really delicious meats. Large portions!! A plate can serve 2. I even split a bowl with my mom and we had leftovers!  Tried the steak and chicken shawarma. Both really good. Have a nice charcoal flavor and perfect texture. Nice and moist.  The salad is so refreshing.   The free water up front is flavored with fresh cucumber of I remember correctly.   Overall good value."}
{"text":"Went to Chickpeas yesterday because I was craving Mid-East food.  The place is clean.  The food is fresh.  The service is good.  Why only three stars?  The food is very bland.  The hummus was OK, but the ground chicken kebob was meh.  Very little flavor.  So unless I really have a hankering for hummus I probably won't be back."}
{"text":"Amazing Persian food at a very reasonable price!  Was just what I was looking for; a bit of the taste of home in Las Vegas. Will definitely treat the whole family next time I am in town. Great job!"}
{"text":"Oh. My. Goodness. This place is delicious. Very large portions so come hungry. We had a little of everything- lentil soup, dolmas, a sampler plate called the Mazza plate, chicken barg, AND a slice of cake. Absolutely amazing. Very friendly staff and warm atmosphere."}
{"text":"What a little hidden gem we stumbled across. Delicious and fresh food. Great lunch specials."}
{"text":"Mmmmmmm!!!!! Chad, the cashier and griller, was personable, sweet, and engaging. He definitely enhanced the experience. Chad alone gets 5 stars!! Nothing makes the experience better than to have a genuinely friendly person right from The start of your visit!   I got the chicken shawarma plate. Large portion and rich in taste. I felt bad because I saw Chad throw butter on the grill so I asked him to remake the chicken for me. And he gladly did it without one ounce of hesitation or remark. He did it with a happy smile. I will say that the food, even after the remake, didnt taste as clean as other places I've tried. But that's just my preference! I want to come back and try their other menu items because everything is made in house!   They even have an array of hot sauces; sriracha, tapatio etc...love that just because it caters to everyone.   I do wish that the plate came with pita bread. And chicken could taste a bit cleaner. Other than that, GO CHAD!"}
{"text":"We ordered delivery from here last night and the food was not good. Medium salad looked small and for the whole meal being $40 (not including drinks for two people) I would have expected better food. My lamb kabob was black! We asked for well done; that doesn't mean I want black food. Only thing I ate was the rice. Shish Kabob on Flamingo is SO much better and I would recommend eating here instead. Wont be ordering from Chickpeas again."}
{"text":"This place was awful. We ordered two Beef Filet Saltani Kabab Plates, the Mazza plate and a side of fries. The kebabs were dry without any flavor, the beef filets were just awful they werent seasoned at all and it did not taste like filet minion, it tasted like old meat that had been sitting in the refrigerator and they heated it up and delivered it to us. The rice was good. The only thing in the Mazza plate that was good was the Tzaki sauce, everything else was tastless and bland. The fries were all burned, it was like they put the leftover scraps at the bottom of the frying pan in a plate and gave it to us. Overall, the place was just horrible! Not to mention the piece of metal like thing my husband found in his plate of Beef Filet Saltani Kabab. What kind of a place leaves a piece of scrapped metal in a customers food?? We called and they reinbursed our money for just hubbys plate since mine did not have that metal thing in it,  at least i did not notice it. Anyways if you are looking for a good mediterranean restaurant with great kebabs, appetizers and just great food then go to shish kebab house! They are the best in town. We should have just ordered from them again rather than trying this place."}
{"text":"A friend and I just had lunch....one word...DEEEELicious....a MUST go to place...The food was incredible...we will be back....YUM!"}
{"text":"Cold chicken, and warm hummus.   Seriously. I ordered a delivery from this place, and I was stoked to see they had no delivery fees, and the food arrived extremely quickly.   That's why receiving cold chicken was so perplexing.. Had it been sitting there already? Receiving cold chicken in a manner that fast, was akin to going into a bathroom nobody has been in, but the toilet seat is mysteriously warm.     What's up with that?  Also, the hummus was warmer than the chicken, and was also extremely oily. Luckily I didn't order it, but they felt the need to throw some in. At first I thought it was a nice little bonus or gift, but after getting it, it's obvious they can't sell the stuff.   Finally after an ordeal, they refunded 25% of my check.. yay.     UPDATE: I see the owner responded with an explanation of the cold chicken that at least makes sense. I will give this place another chance in the future, because it does seem like a lot of others are very happy with it."}
{"text":"I live in california and went to NV. Searched in the net for Persian food and found this place. We had a great experience and ate ground mix which was the great food that I have eaten ever. Also the the guy who is in the front he knows spanish and farsi , was very nice and generous. We ordered small pizza to go , he gave us large one by chance and we wanted to pay but he said it doesn't need to pay. The other persian guy who works in the restaurant also very sweet and have a nice nice to customers. We really enjoy food and ambient. We really recommend to come here especially people who.look forward persian food or mediterranean food"}
{"text":"We stopped in to Chickpeas early on Saturday, for a light snack before disc golfing.  The inside is simple, and clean, although a bit confusing...with the counter set up, it has the feel of a fast food joint, but the tables and chairs, and actual plates/silverwear give it a sit down restaurant feel.    We ordered the shawarma: falafel for me, chicken for my fella.    It came with a small, light salad;  lettuce, cucumbers, and tomato tossed in a super light dressing:  This was good.  I don't even like cucumbers and tomato, and I enjoyed this.    The sharwarma sandwich wraps are enormous! So much for eating light!!    The falafel was absolutely perfect.  Seasoned well, not greasy, very flavorful.  The pita was great too! Can I mention the chicken wrap?  Because it is FULL of chicken.  Unlike other places that skimp on meat, and fill the pita with lettuce, etc, this was CHICKEN.  And its GOOD chicken too.  Tender, juicy, cooked really well...A+!!  So, if the experience was so good, why not 5 stars?  Well, service was polite, but I think we confused her...when ordering the shawarma sandwich, we wanted everything (hummus, tahini, garlic sauce, and the onions/lettuce, etc) except baba ganoush.   We didn't get any hummus, or tahini, or garlic sauce at all on the wrap.   It was still delicious, but we both REALLY wanted those things on the wrap.    We'll be trying it again, for sure...I thought I saw that they deliver, so that definitely might have to happen!!  All in all, it was a great first experience...just next time remember my hummus!"}
{"text":"YAAAAAAS  I am a spoiled California coast girl, raised on the melting pot of all things food in LA, so when I came across this place I braced to be disappointed.  Persian food? In Vegas? No way this will be close to authentic, much less good.   I AM HAPPILY WRONG.   Everyone here not only is happy to serve you and do their job well, the pride in their culture comes out in their food. Perfectly proportioned seasoning in every dish, giant servings, and well-informed servers who clearly want you to enjoy yourself.   Whether it's takeout/delivery or dining in, this place is a must for me at least once a week. Don't miss out on the delicious!"}
{"text":"I had a delivery for a small party.  The delivery was on time and hot. Food was great and more than enough.  Recommend this place absolutely!"}
{"text":"Terrible food. Lamb was so dry and bland. The sauces were awful. The chicken was acceptable but only because the lamb was so terrible. The salads were drowning. Worst of all we ordered delivery and it was 35 mins late with no apology or explanation. Would not recommend and will never go back."}
{"text":"Third time here, it's been great but tonight it's terrible. Food took a long time, and then it was cold. Huge pet peeve when it takes a long time... Soggy cucumber salad... The pie and Mazza platter was huge and  great but not worth the $ for the meal as a whole.... Back to Parsleys I go! Or some other place I haven't tried yet...."}
{"text":"Simply Fantastic.  We were holidaying in Vegas and stumbled upon this place.  We had shawarma - lamb (sliced), beef (ground) and chicken (sliced).  Delicious at a reasonable price.  We returned two days later and along with a re-select of the shawarmas we had  tobuleh and humus.  We were very pleased.  The owner and staff are friendly and courteous and the service is fast.  The ambience and layout are good and the neat and clean cooking area have state of the art grilling and cooking equipment.  Next time in Vegas - we will certainly revisit."}
{"text":"This is one of the best Mediterranean restaurants in town. Prime location near the Las Vegas strip, Service is always very nice, knowledgeable and friendly, Alex really stands out, he made us feel like family. The food is outstanding!! Everything from the Greek salad to the pita bread makes you feel at home, everything is as fresh as can be, any choice of meat kabob is amazing. Food so fresh made right in front of you, always make sure to end the meal with their amazing house made Baklava... great Restutant overall!!"}
{"text":"I was staying Planet Hollywood and try this restaurant for lunch. Clean place, fresh ingredients. Salad very fresh. I ordered barg kabob, my wife chicken barg. Rice good but cold. Barg kabob meat was cold too. Very dry. Chicken was okay. I really like to give 4 star but i have to be fair."}
{"text":"I wanted something quick to eat and this was the best thing within the area so my friend and I decided to give it a try.  Its a fast and casual restaurant where you go up to the counter to pay first and then they'll bring the food out to you. The place isn't too big but there's also patio seats outside. The place was pretty clean, also - which is always a good sign.   As soon as we walked in the girl with glasses at the counter sort of just looked at us really quick and just went back to talking to a co-worker. -_- We didn't get a hello or anything. Made our way to the counter to order and all she says is \"What can I get you?\" Yeah, hello to you too. I'm fine, thanks.   She looked like she hated her job more than life itself. I ignored it because I was starving and just wanted some food.   Ordered the ground beef kabob for dine in. I was hoping to avoid anymore contact with the girl at the counter but she brought out our food. I was hoping she would be a little nicer this time but nope! \"Here.\" And then she threw our plates down on the table. \"Need anything else?\"   It came out pretty quickly and I was amazed at the portions. It filled me up pretty well and had nice flavor to it.   Overall, the food here is pretty good...too bad the service is shit. It disappoints me to write such a bad review based on one person - as I've seen other people that have had better service from other employees. Would I ever come back? If I was in the area and craving Mediterranean food, then yes."}
{"text":"It was typical Mediterranean food. Seasoned kabobs, rice, salad, pocketed vegetables. I would give 5 stars if they would marinate their meats and keep them juicier but all in all the food was ok."}
{"text":"Ordered from this place a few days ago and was not disappointed. Prices are pretty decent since you do get quite a bit of food. My husband and I both ordered the shawarma he had lamb, I did the chicken.... they were HUGE. It literally was two meals for the both of us.   We also ordered the original hummus. So delicious. And it came with warm pita bread. We definitely will order from this place again. They offered free delivery as well off of the doordash app :)"}
{"text":"Just ate at Chickpeas! It was yum! I loved the chicken sandwich. It is large enough to share! The restaurant is very clean and pretty. The owner was very helpful and gave us great advice. And I also loved the baklava!"}
{"text":"Been here 3 different times and all 3 times we may as well have gone to 3 different restaurants that served similar items, but not quite the same.  I am a fan of consistency when it comes to a restaurant because then you know what to expect, unfortunately that is not the case here.  1st time had the Caesar Salad w/ Chicken Shawarma it was very good, nice flavors and huge portion.  2nd time had the Caesar Salad w/ Chicken Shawarma, it was ok, not great but not bad, huge portion.  3rd time had the same exact thing, this time the chicken was fatty, salad was very watery and it just didn't seem at all the same as the previous 2 times.  I don't know that we'll be returning considering the # of options we have the nearby area for food.  If they were to push the flavor and consistency a little more it would get at least a 4 star for the pricing and portions.  Until then, we'll stick with 3."}
{"text":"I wish I had more stars to give. I would give them a million stars. The homemade bread is my favorite thing on this planet. The salad dressing is to die for. The chicken barg and ground chicken kabob was insane. I will be coming back weekly. I can't wait to try everything on the menu. Did I mention the bread?"}
{"text":"I tried this place based on their yelp reviews and I must say this place is amazing. As a cook who used to work in a mediterranean restaurant, I'm pretty picky but I gave this place a try since I live a block away. The seasoning on the meats is exceptional. I had the lamb shawarma, beef kabobs and some hummus. Everything was delicious, the shawarma was the best I've had in my life and the rice was perfectly cooked. Aside from tasting amazing, the portions are very generous. You can easily split one entree between two people. I highly recommend this place, I will definitely be coming back. Best shawarma in Las Vegas."}
{"text":"I'm reviewing the take-out/delivery menu. Beware. Falafel salad was disappointing with little to no Middle Eastern inspiration and dry, dense chickpeas. Salmon salad was equally lackluster. Best to stick with the kabobs and rice."}
{"text":"Great food, good service and right across the street from the office!"}
{"text":"The food is sooo good an the family is really nice a great place to come get good cooking sitting here there verry busy an that is a good thing come try if u like gyro or kabobs so good"}
{"text":"First time I have ever ordered from Chickpeas and I chose this place because we had a vegan in our lunch meeting and he chose.  Ordering on line for 7 people was easy. Had to order 5 days in advance because my of schedule.  Order was delivered early and the food was fantastic! Large quantities, reasonable prices. I had the salmon and quinoa salad and it was filled with layers of flavors.  I will definitely be going here more often especially when we have a diverse bunch of eaters. There is something for everyone's tastes and food restrictions."}
{"text":"This was gross.  I came based on the stellar reviews. The chicken tasted like frozen pre-cooked chicken because it did not have the consistency of chicken.  I didn't think hummus could ever taste bad because who could mess up hummus, right? Wrong. You're much better off buying store bought hummus."}
{"text":"I ordered online and order was confirmed. I paid in full, waited more than 30 minutes and after that got message that my order canceled and I will not get a food. Not good, guys."}
{"text":"Sadly my most recent experience with Chickpeas wasn't near as enjoyable as my prior one. The falafel I ordered did not taste fresh, nor did it have the texture of fresh falafel--it tasted like something that came out of a package as opposed to something that was made in-house. Very disappointing. The shawarma was also not as tasty as it was last time; the lamb had a bit of an odd taste to it, the chicken was more palatable. But both also tasted too salty, once again like they were not using fresh ingredients. I'll give them 3 as an average of the initial 5 star experience and this 1 star experience, but I will probably look to other restaurants, particularly for falafel."}
{"text":"Wow! All I have to say! Amazing food, great staff and the portions are very generous! This is my new spot! The owner even was there greeting and putting a special touch to the experience. A must try cafe with such a vast menu! With all the other Mediterranean and Persian venues to choose from this one has all the values I look for! Keep it up guys!"}
{"text":"Great quality. Great owner. Great to have some authentic Persian food in Vegas! There may be a slight wait as each kabob is made to order but the wait is sure worth while. I'd say this place is great for lunch or dinner. I got it to go and was very impressed with the portion size. They even gave me a free small salad while I was waiting!"}
{"text":"I don't know why this place is so highly rated,  I feel kinda ripped off. I ate the beef schwarma sandwich, and it was really sparse on flavor and ingredients. The beef was really grisly and reminded me of Robertos. There was also the beef barg , the single kebab was only edible. The rice was overcooked and bland. The beef barg plate was $13.95 and in comparison to shish kebab house it's way expensive. I would definitely save my money and go to Shish kebab house instead."}
{"text":"So good! Portions are massive and the food is delicious! Babaganoush was amazing.  There's something wrong with the soda and tea fountains, but other than that I really can't say a bad word about this place."}
{"text":"Food was delicious!!! Had it at a work catered event, great portions and everything was fresh!!!"}
{"text":"I did a yell search and came across this gem. A day of wedding dress shopping and we were starved. 4 girls and one prego so we were hungry.  I couldn't have asked for a better experience. The gentleman behind the register asked if we'd been here before, and then explained everything after we said no. We ended up staying an hour and half. Thankyou for amazing fresh food and great service."}
{"text":"I love this place , the food is amazing  Excellent restaurant, but It was only one server who  was rude to her co workers , she was screaming at them front of the customers to clean the tables I was so disappointed  I could not believe what just happened , of her rudeness ."}
{"text":"Ordered through yelp, easy menu to navigate, timely and FREE delivery, and yummy food. This place did great!"}
{"text":"Placed an order on Eat24hours for the first time and I must say I am truly impressed. Ordered the lamb shawarma plates and got a hummus with bread free. The meat is spiced and grilled to perfection and the seasoning is AMAZING! My girlfriend ordered a latte and it tasted like the ones you can get in Italy. I must say we were both impressed and will order again."}
{"text":"Fist time ordering and we loved it! So fresh... portions are very generous! I ordered a rack of lamb and served me and my husband and it would have been good for a third person. We'll definitely go again."}
{"text":"Really wanted to like this place but was very disappointed. Service was awkward to non-existent. I ordered the maza platter and the lamb kabobs. It took twenty two minutes to serve the maza platter. Keep in mind this is a cold appetizer platter, everything is already prepared all they had to do was plate it! There was no other patrons ahead of me and only two tables came in after me. Everything on the platter was bland except the tabouli which was just okay. The humus lacked tahini, garlic, lemon, salt I have had better off the supermarket shelf. The mazza platter does not come with pita bread instead it came with something resembling cold mini pizzas, useless for eating the items on the maza platter. About ten minutes latter the kabobs showed up. They were tough and also had no flavor and also were not served with bread. The people at the table next to me, who were having issues of their own, said \"if you want bread you have to ask for it\" seriously? Chickpeas has the distinction of being the first Mediterranean/Middle Eastern restaurant in the world out of the 70 or 80 that I have eaten at that did not serve me pita bread with maza or kabobs. With all the great Middle Eastern restaurant choices we have in this town I can not find any reason to return to this place."}
{"text":"Love the foodespecially the Mazza plate best for vegans... Everything here is excellent"}
{"text":"In one word \"outstanding!!\" Both the food and staff!  I could name everything we had and it was a lot, but I'm sure every item in this establishment is excellent!!  A must visit when in the Las Vegas area!!  Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Excellent salmon with Eastern style rice.  Reasonable prices, friendly staff and a cozy outdoor patio.  Will definitely be back."}
