{"text":"New favorite! The coffee and espresso drinks are top notch, and the food will wow you. Great atmosphere, old-time train station charm."}
{"text":"This place is so cool, hidden behind the train. All the coffee drinks are great. The breakfast ham/egg sandwich is crazy good."}
{"text":"This is a beautiful space and a great concept, but there are kinks that need to be worked out service-wise and the seating is incredibly awkward. 

I ordered 12 oz chai and was told in-house is only available in 8 oz. I understand wanting to cut back on waste, but why have it on the menu if I can't order it? They were also out of the food item I ordered and told me it would be 20 minutes to make it so I went with a bowl of soup. Somehow that also ended up taking 20 minutes to get out to the table, so what gives? 

Next, we attempted to find a place to sit. Nearly every seat was taken by someone on a laptop nursing a cup of coffee, yet somehow they took up an incredible amount of space. We sat at the awkward communal table looking at the backs of everyone's computer screens. Not very warm, inviting, or relaxing. I couldn't comfortably eat because there are so many seats in such a small space. I felt like I had to glue my elbows to my sides. 

Had there been more space to eat and better communication about what was actually available to order (like a menu board that can be changed rather than a printed menu), I think my experience would have been a lot more pleasant. 

The minestrone and the chai latte were both really good, but the overall experience was overshadowed by the straight up awkward vibe in there and it just wasn't enough to bring me back any time soon."}
{"text":"Great space and decent coffee drinks! This is the only place serving Counter Culture in town so I'm glad to support them. Really unique location, but unfortunately a bit difficult to find."}
{"text":"Have been back a few times and feel pretty much the same as I did with original review.  Looking forward to the weather being nice and being able to eat outside.  

Last week I tried the waffle.  It was interesting!  Tasted a bit like the sourdough pancakes the SO makes, but covered in a kind of caramel?  Undercooked, but not in a bad way?  Hard to describe; the sourdough/caramel was an interesting combo.  I won't be running back for another tomorrow, but will probably try one again in a few months."}
{"text":"This is a new place in town and everything is great there, the food, the service and the atmosphere. I tried the chai latte with whole milk and the banana bread, both were delicious."}
{"text":"Very awkward interior. The space has potential but is not utilized properly. The community table in the middle of the floor is cramped! People waiting for food and drinks look confused and uncomfortable. 
The service was not great. They forgot to make the drink I ordered, and when I checked in about it they said they had given it to someone else. If so, why didn't they make another for me right away instead of waiting for me to complain? Food was okay but not worth the hassle. Will not come again. Staff were friendly but definitely not on their game."}
{"text":"Nestled in an old train station, Porter Coffee is both nostalgic and progressive. Great place to catch up with friends or study for those midterms. Food selections are great for sandwich lovers. Espresso was good enough to drink on its own. Great local catch!"}
{"text":"Wouldn't serve me decaffeinated coffee without making me pay extra. I left extremely angry at this ableist bullshit."}
{"text":"I was disappointed. I had heard a lot of hype about Porter so I decided to give it a try. The coffee was good and reasonably priced, as were the rest of the drinks, but the rest of the food was ridiculous. The avocado toast was expensive and not good. It tasted weirdly of sesame or soy sauce, but not in a way that worked. It was also incredibly salty. For $7, expected MUCH more. Pros were that the service was friendly, the food came fast, and space was unique (but also awkward). My friend got a chai which was strongly cinnamon-y and left a strange aftertaste. The sandwiches looked good but I'm sure they were also egregiously overpriced."}
{"text":"Four Words: Breakfast Sandwich plus everything.

My favorite sandwich is an egg sandwich so believe me when I say that this one is my favorite of all time. Not one of my favorites, but MY FAVORITE. The ham is perfection and the brioche roll is buttery. I also ordered the avocado toast. It should not be missed. I ordered it as a  side to the breakfast sandwich because if you only order the sandwich, you'll end up ordering another one; add a little something to help that temptation.

Be patient. There are typically only 2 people working (cashier and barista). They make everything in front of you. Seating is limited in the cafe, so be prepare to take your sandwich with you. Coffee was excellent. A new favorite find in Mad-Town!"}
{"text":"Great coffee, breakfast was delicious, place was clean. Don't get to Madison much, but next time I come, I will surely be back. Nice to have a place to eat I can count on!"}
{"text":"My husband has been trying to get me out here for some time, and I finally got to go on a date with him. We went at 8:30 am for breakfast, and I fell in love with the location, atmosphere and setting right away.

Though it was breakfast time, I couldn't resist the soup and sandwich option - the vegan version of the marinated veggie sandwich, on toasted Madison Sourdough multigrain bread, with a cup of vegan mushroom soup. (They also have pastries from Lazy Jane's that were hard to resist.)

I wouldn't have changed a thing about the meal or my drink: an almond milk \"flat white.\" Never had a better coffee. That means out of THOUSANDS OF COFFEES this one is at the TOP of the heap. Yeah. Let that sink in.

The sandwich is light and lemony, and I can't picture it being any better with a big blop of mayo and cheese. It would have been flat white ceiling paint on the Mona Lisa. The soup had a good dose of black pepper and I loved it. 

Perfect experience. Will dream of until I can repeat it..."}
{"text":"I've never had food at Porter but I need to write a review because it deserves it and I've been coming here for coffee and the charm and the atmosphere in the mornings. Now that it's not freezing out, I see more patrons in here now, many working on their laptops in here as well. I don't like working in a small space and despite windows it's a little shadowy. The staff is always great. The coffee is good. I usually get an almond milk latte. The place is just happiness. When I walk by it I can't help but smile too."}
{"text":"Dang!!  I'm in my 50s, I went to undergrad in Madison, I'm a Deadhead, I've eaten literally hundreds of veggie sandwiches in my life thus far, possibly thousands - HANDS DOWN the veggie sandwich at Porter with the marinated artichoke, salt roasted tomato, the whole damn thing, just YUM. We ordered food for a lunch meeting and there was one veggie sandwich left, warm and grilled, and I thought it was going to turn into Lord of the Flies in there.  Bravo!  Cannot WAIT to try the rest of the menu."}
{"text":"This is a small, cute place and it's hidden by the train tracks so a bit hard to find but very picturesque. The staff weren't too chatty (it wasn't very busy but they may not have been in the mood to say much), but their coffee was great. I got a breve cortado and it had perfect microfoam, plus they use Counter Culture which I didn't know distributed this far west, so I was very pleased! There aren't outlets on side tables so come prepared if you're going to do work, or just sit at the communal island in the middle. All in all, it's a bit out of the way so I likely won't come here too often, but it will be a welcome get away every once in a while."}
{"text":"Stopped by for breakfast today. We tried the breakfast sandwich, avocado toast, a latte, and a black coffee. Everything was very good. However, I don't think the sandwich warrants a close to $10 price tag. It was good but maybe not thaaaat good. 

Coffees were fine and toast was great. While I'd def return, I might look for a place slightly less expensive first!"}
{"text":"Great spot to grab some coffee or a casual lunch. The location/ambiance is what really makes Porter unique as it's hugged against the train tracks. I had the chai latte, flourless cookie, minestrone soup and roast beef sandwich. Everything tasted really fresh, but I wouldn't say anything was particularly a must have. I'll have to make a second visit for some black coffee to see how it holds up!"}
{"text":"Came to Madison and this was the first place I ate at. Service was great, food was amazing, and the coffee was incredible. Everything felt very fresh and very flavorful. Definitely a great place to stop by."}
{"text":"I hope the rest of the Washington Market unfolds as beautifully as Porter. This coffee shop is lovely. It's tucked away behind Motorless Motion, a bit off the beaten path at the moment, but I can picture the rest of the platform developing into a bustling public market. (Planned to be finished summer 2017!) 

I ordered the Avocado Toast with added n'duja and it was divine. The lemon zest and sea salt balance nicely with the creamy avocado. Yum!

The interior is charming, as is the service. A great addition. :)"}
{"text":"It's only coffee and at this coffee stop except that plus bad attitude. Horribly rude service.  Too many other options save your time and money and go to a place that values their customers"}
{"text":"I gave this a 2 only because of poor customer service on the part of one specific staff. Ben prepared fantastic food for us two days in a row - the avocado toast, either with or without an egg, is simply fantastic.

This morning, though, when I ordered a latte with light foam and it came out with about an inch and a half of foam, the customer service went wrong in a hurry.  When I saw how much foam there was,  I asked for some of it to be removed. Without looking up or saying anything to me, Corrine (not sure of the spelling, but it is pronounced 'core-in') took the drink from my hand and dumped out some of the latte, dribbling a bunch of it down the side. None of the foam came out of the cup, though. She then took a spoon and scooped some of the foam out of the cup and added more latte. I appreciated what she had done to make my drink the way I had asked for it of her in the first place. I told her \"thank you I appreciate that\"... No response. She didn't even look up or make eye contact. No apology, no smile, nothing. I repeated myself and said \"thank you\"... And, nothing. Not even a glance. 

It was her mistake in the first place, yet it did not matter that I, as the customer, appreciated her making it right - without calling her out on her own mistake.

So, the shop owner can thank her for a low rating when it would otherwise have been fantastic."}
{"text":"Great coffee and great atmosphere. My coworkers and I go and work from there. The coffee and food is great plus easy downtow parking!!"}
{"text":"Porter has a very unique location and interior.  We tried the breakfast sandwich and the porter pocket, which was like a hot pocket quiche.  Both were good, as was the drip coffee that we tried.  They also serve beer, wine, bakery items, and lunch.

The only downside is how very small the cafe is, and this is why I'm giving it 4 stars instead of 5.  There's not much seating inside the actual cafe, but there's additional seating inside the bike shop next door.  That seating area has a nice view of the train, which is cool, but it's really awkward to sit and eat among the merchandise and is quite cold.  The shop wasn't open yet when we went, but I imagine it would be even more awkward if people were trying to shop around you.  It's also quite cold there, but uncomfortably hot inside the cafe because of the open kitchen layout.  Because of this, it just isn't a very pleasurable or relaxing dining experience.  I don't think it really fits the vibe they're going for, either -- I wouldn't pay $7 for a glass of wine and $10+ for a delicious meal if I had to eat it sitting besides a clothing rack.  If you are taking your food to go, or you happen upon the cafe when it isn't very busy, then it's a nice place.  I'm hoping they can set up tables out on the platform when it's warmer out - then I would probably go back."}
{"text":"I love Porter! Yes, as other people have noted, the space is a bit small and awkward so visit on off hours and you will be rewarded. The space, smallness aside, is very cool. It's got that reclaimed wood vibe throughout and there are always great indie tunes playing. Available seating options include a few small tables for two,  a larger community table with bar stools or a short counter space. The offer up more seating options in the space between their shop and the bike shop too. We sat in there once and I'd rather just take my stuff to go than sit in there. It's a cold barren space without music. I wasn't a fan. This is definitely not a place to camp out and get work done but a fantastic spot to sip and nibble.

On to the awesomeness: the coffee is outstanding. Yes, again as others have noted, portions are small and about $1 more than other places but it's totally worth it. True espresso lovers won't be offended by the small size-that's what the real stuff is all about. If you are looking for a large heavily flavored/sugared up latte, go elsewhere. Want a top notch cortado? This is the place for you!

The have a nice variety of foods/treats. The Porter pocket was delicious and an absolute belly bomb. It's a delightful flaky pocket filled with eggs, bacon, swiss and leeks that didn't seem heavy while eating it but kept me full well past lunch time! I can't wait to be back again and again."}
{"text":"Went here during opening week!

As far as coffee goes -- they know their stuff. They knew where their espresso beans were from, the specific roast... And my cortado was perfect. A little pricy, but honestly not a problem if you value high quality coffee... really state of the art.

If you have trouble finding it: itis next to the train, underneath the roof there. Kinda hidden.

As far as coffee shops though -- more of a stop-in place. Very minimal seating (1 table, 1 wall bar), no where to sit and have a private conversation, which is a bummer. If someone asks if you \"want to get some coffee?\" I would not recommend here, for that reason."}
{"text":"I only knew of this places existence with a yelp search. I don't think anyone would stumble on it where it's located and tucked back in there, but heck, they were so busy around 12:30 yesterday for lunch that they seem to be doing alright business without being in a high traffic area! Super cute (but small) inside with a cool industrial type vibe. Lots of unique condiments, cooking oils, a few wines for sale. They had a fun collection of beer and I had a carbonated tea (never heard of this concept before!) which was delicious. My husband really loved his Cubano but thought there was too much of the mustard which overpowered it a bit. I got the turkey apple sandwich, and they were willing to put it on a bed of greens instead of bread for me. It was so good!! We topped it off with a flourless oatmeal chocolate chip cookie which was to die for. We will definitely come back! Would love to try a coffee drink."}
{"text":"I think Porter could be great - like 4, 5 star great. However- their service needs to improve.  Came in with some questions about coffee and the guy behind the counter was just rude. Sorry if when you explain a Cortado as espresso and some foam, that I then ask what's the difference between that and a macchiato. 
The latte was pricey for a 8oz coffee - with tip came out to be over 4 dollars.  Mind you, I am not one to know the countries and the beans, I'm more of it like it or don't like it - and I mostly like coffee drinks type of person. 
I've gotten their food in the past and has been happy but not thrilled about it. They used to have this kale/grits/egg/bacon thing and while DELICIOUS, was impossible to eat in the mason jar that they served it in (never mind also impossible to hold since it had to handle and the thing was very hot). It's no longer on the menu. 
Porter is the place I always think - oh that'd be nice, what a treat! And after I go, I end up disappointed.  Hoping it will get better over time."}
{"text":"I really think this place is great. They have several wonderful options for breakfast and their baked goods are unique to the location and fabulous. Especially the peanut butter cookies!

The breakfast Sandwich is out of this world. 100% recommended ANY TIME OF DAY.

They do not have a Nitro option but they have a very strong cold brew that gets my addiction, at the very least, tickled if not completely satisfied (I believe everyone should have a nitro option, for those truly affected).

They also sell an array of boutiquey items. not my thing but hey, its available. 

Kind of tucked away its a great space to work out of or meet someone for some quiet conversation before your day begins (I take all of my night time guests here for a morning cup of joe and a goodbye ; ))."}
{"text":"Such a nice hidden spot next to the train! Had an iced latte and the avocado toast - both were delicious. I loved the amount of avocado and the spices added a nice little kick. The only reason I give it 4 instead of 5 stars is because it feels a bit overpriced. $6.50 for one piece of toast was too much, but all in all great experience."}
{"text":"I don't know if it was the beautiful weather or the charm of the train depot, but I came away thinking that all was right with the world. Anytime an establishment can make you feel that way even for a little while is a win in my book. 

We came here on a Saturday morning looking for some food and caffeine. I ordered a bocadillo with prosciutto, and it came half wrapped in butcher paper. Prosciutto with a soft cheese on an ultra crusty bread - a little too hard on the crust as it tore up the roof of my mouth. The house made chai latte I ordered was deliciously spicy, and one of the better ones I've had around town. My boyfriend ordered the Porter pocket with scrambled eggs and bacon. The filling was hot and deliciously flaky. It was like a fancy hot pocket, but way tastier. 

While we sat on their covered patio, enjoying our food and caffeine, looking at the old train, I felt like I was on one of my trips to Europe, enjoying a crusty bread salami sandwich while waiting for the next train out of town. 

This place gets 4 stars, even though it's more like 3.5 because I think a couple of tweaks could make them better. I'd love to see an expanded menu with more non-sandwich offerings. I also found the bocadillo and porter pocket a bit overpriced, and it's a bit weird that in-house drinks only come in 8oz servings."}
{"text":"Service was excellent with a wonderful flat white and drip coffee. I had the avocado and n'duja toast and it was scrumptious. The Porter Pocket my fiancé had was quite good as well. 
This is a charming, tucked away coffee shop that we hope sticks around for a long time."}
{"text":"Porter is the best coffee shop in town! The coffee quality is exceptional. The lattes, flat whites and other fancy drinks are fabulous, but honestly, the best way to go is a simple drip. It's rich, it's steamy, and it packs plenty of caffeine! The ambiance is relaxed, with group seating and chill music. I love the food; ya can't go wrong... here's my ranking of what's good, from best to least-best (there is no worst!):
-the switchman (I think this was on special, but it's the BEST. Savory grits, eggs, kale... yum)
-avo toast with n'duja (so salty, so crunchy, so delish)
-prosciutto bocadillo (PROSCIUTTO IS BAE)
-Lazy Jane's lemon scone (sweet, moist, nom)
-breakfast sandwich (ham is amazing, get if ya love mustard)
-house savory scone (very filling)
-porter pocket (not as good as I expected)
-breakfast bocadillo (not a fan of cold egg omelette in a sandwich, BUT the arugula is off the chain)
Stop in with friends or solo to savor some wonderful drinks and foodz. You won't regret it."}
{"text":"Amazing find! By far the best avocado toast in Madison. The coffee and drinks are also really good. The bread tastes fresh and perfectly crunchy. 

What really makes this place is the location and the atmosphere. The cute locations by the train tracks adds to the quaintness of the place. I can't wait to seat and enjoy a cup of coffee and baked good here when it gets warm."}
{"text":"Tucked away in an old train depot, Porter turns out some fantastic coffee and eats.  I've stopped in a few times now and staff have always been welcoming and helpful.  During our last visit, we stopped in for a quick bite during brunch.  I opted for the breakfast sandwich and bloody mary while my girlfriend went with the pre-made caprese bocadillo.  My sandwich was on point-willow creek ham, pickled red onions, cheese, egg on a brioche bun that was out of this world.  My bloody, well that was a different story.  I can appreciate they make the mix homemade but I found it more on the bland side (although I asked for it spicy).  It's a coin flip whether I would have it again.  The bocadillo was solid and a great option for a grab and go customer.  Located right off the commuter path, I see myself hitting it up a lot this summer during bike rides or runs."}
{"text":"Porter saved my life. I just moved to an apartment across the street and AT&T could not get my internet to work. I've been camping out at Porter the last couple days waiting for the AT&T technician to come and fix my internet. No surprise, AT&T has not been reliable and the technician has been postponing my appointment. Luckily Porter here offers way better service and excellent food and coffee. 

I've had their breakfast sandwich, vegetable sandwich, and minestrone soup which have all been fresh and excellent. They also have pre-made salads which are very reasonably priced. The servers are incredibly kind and gracious. When AT&T sucks, thank sweet baby jesus Porter has free wifi! I'm looking forward to coming back even after my internet gets fixed."}
{"text":"The coffee was ok, but the food was not great at all.  This place only deserves 2 stars. First, they could only offer 4 food items from their menu.  One was a yogurt parfait.  When you only have 8 total it doesn't leave many options.  The breakfast sandwich was overpowered by the mustard and the turkey sandwich was overpowered by the chèvre.  Nobody in here besides me and the three workers and I waited 20 minutes for my food.  The seating is uncomfortable as well.  The main seating is a communal table with no backs in the chairs.  I won't be back to try this again."}
{"text":"Great food and grab and go sandwiches. The Counter Culture coffee is great as well. They do raclette services which i heard good things about."}
{"text":"Cozy and quaint space with a slightly awkward flow.  There's a large community high-top table in the middle of the room with short counters along two of the walls.  If you're not bothered by the line of people waiting to order on one side, the people waiting for their drinks on another side or the people that just picked up their order and are hovering around waiting for a stool, you can sit and chill as long as you want.  There's additional seating on the other side of the main wall, but I think it was a bit cold in there.  

Prices are higher and drinks are definitely on the small side.  I tried the chai tea latte - good, but small for $4.50.  They had a nice selection of baked goods and the donuts looked delicious, but were placed out in the open on top of the counter which seemed slightly germ-y to me.  They were out of the Pocket Porter, so my husband ordered the breakfast panini - I did not try it, but it looked like an average sandwich.  Porter is the perfect fit for this space and will compliment the future Washington Market nicely."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere, service, drinks and food. I came here during the summer and sat by the train car, enjoying my amazing avocado toast with egg. It was a truly amazing experience"}
{"text":"Love this place!!!! We got Cubano and avocado toast, taste delicious. Great coffee too. I also really like the decoration and atmosphere there."}
{"text":"Quaint coffee shop with tables for sipping your joe while surfing the net. They have a variety of food and drink items (including liquor and wine) to tempt you. I got a medium brewed coffee and it was pretty darn good. The size of the medium is really the size of a small, so do watch for that. I was a bit shocked at the small cup I was served. The prices are a little higher than other places nearby. The main entrance is kind of tucked in the back near the train cars, or you can cut through the adjacent bike shop to get into the cafe. I didn't get anything to eat and there were only a couple of baked items in the case to choose from. It looked like they had a listing of sandwiches available, so I may need to venture back at some point to try one. This is a nice addition to the area, as we only have Panera near by. And this coffee was way better than that at Panera."}
{"text":"Back for a summer try! A lot of new seating, both inside and out. It's Wednesday morning at 8:30 and plenty of space. Had a pour over and breakfast sandwich. Don't balk at the price of the sandwich. It's big, high quality and oh so worth it.  A runny yolk? I'm in love. I did pick some onions off because I wasn't  in to texture on my sandwich and they were pretty powerful. Personal preference.  It was a nice touch that it was beautifully paper wrapped. Keep doing it right,  Porter!"}
{"text":"Easily the best breakfast sandwich in town. The avocado toast, mozzarella bocadillo, and yogurt parfait are all awesome as well. I could see the prices putting some folks off, but I think the food is well worth it. This place is a must."}
{"text":"The breakfast sandwich is amazing and so is the yogurt parfait!!!

The staff always makes you feel like long time friends but friends that make delicious food and even better lattes"}
{"text":"Porter has good coffee. The food looks Instagram good, but doesn't taste as good as It looks. The prices are a bit much for What you get. Had the avocado on bread and it tasted meh. Had the leige waffle and it was too dense. The location is cool, since it looks like a scene from Harry Potter."}
{"text":"I really love the concept of Porter, but it seemed like they had a few kinks to work out when I stopped in for lunch on Monday. The food was great, the service was great, they were just out of a lot of items.

Normally, I can't help but order a coffee drink, even if it's late in the day, but I was distracted by the fact that Porter stocks Topo Chico, a sparkling water from Mexico, so I grabbed one of those and went up to order some food.

I settled on the soup and sandwich combo, but when I asked for the veggie sandwich, the cashier told me they were out. Bummer! I got the mozzarella panini instead, which was excellent. The soup was minestrone and also had great flavor. What bread was on that panini? It was out of this world. 

Adding the sandwich outage, the cashier told the guy behind me that they were out of baguette for one of the other items. The girl behind him ended up having to pay in cash because their credit card machine was down.

In addition to coffee and hot food, they have a little market with some very random merchandise. Everything from local honey, pizza flour, pickles, mustard, and sugar.

They also have beer and wine to enjoy there AND to go!!! It didn't mention that anywhere on their website, so I wanted to point that out.

Overall, I REALLY like the new place, especially considering how good the food was. Hopefully my next visit will be 5 stars!"}
{"text":"Love this place, it's an adorable hidden gem. Good coffee and the avocado toast was pretty good too. Music was great--as I was sitting there doing my work I didn't use my headphones because the music that was playing was exactly the music that I would have been playing myself (which never happens). 

I love the tall community island in the middle. I sometimes stand there and do my work, but I also like being able to sit down at an individual table both inside and outside."}
{"text":"If I were a coffee shop, I would be Porter. Unassuming, tucked away, and filled with delicious, and high-quality goodies.

I had a pour over ($3.50) and an avocado toast ($7) with n'duja, an Italian salumi spread, added (+$3). The toast, though unsurprisingly pricey at $10, was absolutely delicious. Crunchy, savory, creamy, tangy. My mouth is watering as I type this. I only wish there was more avocado as I feel Crescendo is more generous with their avocado for about the same baseline price. Overall, I do enjoy the taste and texture of Porter's toast more.

I'm happy that I live so close by as I've been eyeing Porter's other sandwiches, and I absolutely cannot wait to come back to try them."}
{"text":"Best place in Madison for REAL caffeine drinks. (Quad shot Iced Americano, nothing added, for me) For some reason, quality does depend on the Barista, but let's be honest.... still way better than other coffee shops in town. The chick that works the weekend is the best! She weighs out the grounds and it ends up being the smoothest, non bitter, espresso. 
I need to know her ways!!! 
Can I also mention that they have a rewards system that doesn't involve a million damn punch cards in my wallet????? Type in your phone number at the register and they'll keep track for you! 
I don't want to be friends with people that like punch cards."}
