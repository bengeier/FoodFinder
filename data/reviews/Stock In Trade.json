{"text":"Have tried the meats from this place a few times, and have always been pleased. Tonight a group of my friends tried one of their Supper Club nights (once a month, posted on their chalkboard) and had what is one of the most delicious meals of my life. BJ and Jason were so friendly and just fantastic hosts. Their food was incredible, and some pretty serious value for your dollar. I would highly recommend making a reservation for a supper club night, or swing by during the day for a reasonably priced and delicious sammich. Also really looking forward to the many butchery classes they offer. Love that a place like this has opened up on the Danforth."}
{"text":"My favourite butcher shop! Passionate staff and great meat. Interesting sandwiches that change regularly and are always made to order."}
{"text":"Sometimes I wonder if we're suppose to love it because it's \"ethical butcher meat\". Or that the staff is hipster friendly.  I bought two roast beef sandwiches and some chicken. The sandwiches were so chewy. With every bite a whole hunk would come out.  It was bland lacking in substance.  The chicken was ok. Nothing to rave about.  I'm sorry for this review. Tried u guys three times,  one sandwich that was a sausage was ok. But could have doubled up the meat. Very dry also."}
{"text":"What a gem! Just grabbed an amazing sandwich w my fianc√© this afternoon. He grabbed the schnitzel and I got fried chicken. Amazing flavours, so fresh, amazing bun. Grabbed some sausages, organic milk and cheese while here too. They also do meat pies! We'll be back for sure. Well done! Yum!!!"}
{"text":"This review is solely about their sandwiches. The sandwiches are big and loaded and sure to satisfy any appetite, but if there's a \"but\" it's that they seem to be constructed without much thought given to the act of actually eating a sandwich. They are tasty, to be sure, but you'll want to grab extra napkins, because you will absolutely be making a mess. 

They have started baking their own focaccia bread in house, and I'm sure it's fine as focaccia goes, but it's not great as sandwich bread. The sandwiches are a mess to eat. The bread is unyielding to the generous portions of meat, so things fall apart pretty quickly. Also their insistence on sliced grape tomatoes instead of their full-sized cousins, means that the little buggers shoot out of the sides with each bite, like a bar of soap from a slippery grip.

I'll be back because it's one of the few places in the immediate neighbourhood to get a quick lunch to-go that isn't Subway. I just wish the sandwiches were as great as they have the potential to be.

The rice bowls do not disappoint."}
{"text":"Was stoked to have a neighbourhood butcher/small business I could support in the community and a shop to establish a rapport with, but at best the staff is uninterested and distracted, and at worst they've been downright rude. The selection can be sparse and the prices are on the high side, which would be easier to overlook if the overall experience was better, or consistent."}
{"text":"The staff are exceptionally friendly and knowledgeable. Love their roast chicken & potatoes, great option when you don't have time to cook."}
{"text":"Best butcher, best meat and staff is super helpful. The only other butcher that compares is Cumbreas, which is great too but way more $$$"}
{"text":"Love this place. It's a hip little butcher shop. Everything seems to be local. Staff is super friendly. They have a wide array of custom sausages and the best bacon I've ever had. The actual 'block' is right in the front window so sometimes you can see them going to town.

They also do these little supper club events, which I am not foodie enough to participate in, but appreciate that they do it.

Plus they have these fantastic $7 sandwiches that are always amazing. I don't know why you'd go to Subway down the street when this is right here.

Dog gets a pig ear every time I go. Which is at least once a week. It's a nice alternative to Meat Dept. down by Broadview."}
{"text":"This is a local butcher with great staff. Not only are they friendly, but they are also quite helpful and accommodating. Their meat is fresh and local. It is a regular stop for me. I have also been having their salads regularly, including their take-out menu items."}
{"text":"I adore a good sandwich and here they do it right! Menu changes daily, good for those who like surprises.  No seating so purely take out. Nice clean store with no unpleasant odors. Fellow in the front carving up a carcass so vegans you'll definitely want to avoid this store. I felt that I stepped into a man cave kitchen.  

Hubby and I tried the following:

-Pork Pinbone (a type of cut) Steak Sandwich - this is the kind of sandwich you can really sink your teeth into: savoury, succulent with wonderful flavors in a delicious artisan roll that is sturdy enough to contain it all. Not a dainty finger sandwich, keep it in the wrapper and only expose what you're going to bite otherwise you might lose a tasty morsel of meat. Not for those dieting because they don't trim off the fat here.

-Crispy Beef Sandwich - Asian flavor profile, tasty.

-Butternut Squash and Lemongrass Soup - cashier/cook asked if I wanted him to \"finish it\" with some pork belly HECK YEAH! I don't say \"no\" to pork belly. Soup was thick and hearty with some heat to add even more interest.

-Maple Beans - the consistency of a chunky type of refried beans. Smoky with a touch of sweetness and a little kick of spice.

- a shot of bone broth $1- great depth of flavour and no, they don't skim off the fat. They boil the bones overnight and use this as a base for their soups.

Happy-go-lucky staff that are very engaging and a cook that will tweak the menu to accommodate your dietary wishes. Love it here!"}
{"text":"One of my favourite places to buy meats on the Danforth. The meat selection is great and the staff are really knowledgeable. Stock-in-Trade also makes their own sausages and sandwiches, which are amazing! Keep up the great work."}
{"text":"Stopped by to try the sandwiches with a few friends, and we all enjoyed it. We got the porchetta and pastrami sandwiches. Both cuts were fairly fatty, but in a good way. But if you don't like fat it might not be your thing. The only thing that would have made the porchetta sandwich better would be some pork crackling.

The sandwiches are done on half a baguette, and there aren't a bunch of frills, or sides, but well worth 6 dollars. If you are looking for an affordable lunch or dinner on The Danforth this is it.

I've been told they also have someone breaking down cuts of meats in the front window sometimes, though we were there near closing. We really appreciated that they were willing to make sandwiches for us so close to closing time.

This seems like a business worth supporting. A neighbourhood butcher like this is a beautiful thing."}
{"text":"This was my first time trying Stock in Trade. I have walked by many times and I just thought oh nice butcher shop. On Yelp I noticed that they have sandwiches. I decided to give it a go!

I had the fried chicken sandwich. WOW! It was amazing!  Two chicken breasts fried to crispy golden perfection with a lemony dressing. Topped with arugula and zucchini and salsa verde!  The flavours worked very well together. The bun was nice and fresh and even though it fell apart on me (I didn't mind!) I was licking my fingers when done. I will definitely be back to try the other things on the menu. They gave me a piece of their homemade pastrami to try and it was mouth watering. That will probably be my next Sandwich!  Go eat here it's well worth it!"}
{"text":"I tried Stock In Trade for the first time today after having an eye on it for quite some time. 
I just finished a pastrami sandwich ($10) and it was absolutely delicious. An employee recommended pastrami, I cannot say I have ever had a pastrami sandwich before, but this was the best one I have ever had, it was delicious, so much flavour I had to crack a beer with my lunch.  Cole slaw and pickles with an aioli, it was exactly what I was craving & I will definitely be back soon."}
{"text":"Love the staff here - always helpful and they never cease to surprise me with different prepared sausages and advice for cooking. The sandwiches are great! We plan on doing to the supper club thing soon."}
{"text":"A great neighborhood meat place. I don't know why it took me so long before I stepped into this place.  The guys here are hip ( also cool), knows their meat well and always delighted to give recommendations. 

Downside is, it is abit pricey compared to your typical butcher store. But the meat is fresh and definitely comparable to Sanagan butcher in Kensington. 

They also rotate their sandwiches weekly. All good and worthy of the thumbs up."}
{"text":"Stock In Trade might not be everyone's favourite sandwich shop, but they sure are my kind of butchers. I don't come here for anything else but the sandwiches, which are huge, loaded with meat and toppings, and very fresh.

They prepare everything out in the open, serving some sandwiches hot and some cold. I never know exactly what they're gonna have on the menu which is part of the fun for me. Located on the Danforth, I always look forward to a nice walk through this neighbourhood after devouring a satisfying sandwich. The dudes here are friendly, helpful and passionate about meat."}
{"text":"This place makes the best sandwiches I've ever had! The staff are super helpful and friendly and I learn something about sandwiches and meats every time I go there. They're always changing up their menu of sandwiches, and wings etc. so I need to keep going. The prices on the menu also include tax, which is nice."}
{"text":"perfect, perfect place. staff are hilarious and attentive, know their meat, always down to give cooking ideas & inspo. i literally commute 45 mins just to get my hands on those pork chops. long have i been a ribeye devotee, but these chops have easily moved to the top of this meat pyramid i call a diet."}
