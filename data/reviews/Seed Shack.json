{"text":"We went to try out this new restaurant for brunch today. Since neither of us were vegetarians we tried the Beyond burger and avocado toast with bacon.  My husband, who's a meat-lover, was not disappointed by the burger. The patty was juicy and the 'cashew cheese' was a nice touch. The sweet potato fries were not greasy and only lightly salted. The avocado toast was nice and thick, and the rice-paper bacon had real bacon taste and crunch. All the ingredients tastes fresh and we didn't have to wait too long for the food to come out. The restaurant is relaxed, I loved the decor and there's free wifi and electrical outlets at every booth seat for your devices. I look forward to coming back and trying other menu items."}
{"text":"Seed Shack is a fantastic place for vegan foods. We signed up for the special Christmas Eve dinner to try them out for the fist time. We were not disappointed. The food was excellent. We liked it so much we came in the very next week for breakfast. Seed Shack is a great East Valley vegan dining choice. I would highly recommend them."}
{"text":"My husband and I ate here 2 days in a row it was that good.  The vegan chili was outstanding,  tortilla soup was amazing. I love that the entire menu is vegan. Today I had an avacado smoothie with pea protein added.  This will be my new go to place.  Welcome to our neighborhood Seed Shack."}
{"text":"Absolutely loved this restaurant.  The food was great, the service was outstanding, and the environment was really relaxed.  I loved the little pillows on the benches that looked like slices of food.

I'm not in the neighborhood often, but I will definitely stop back by and try something else wonderful from the menu.  I had the beet burger and the golden milk on this last visit.

So glad they are in business!"}
{"text":"This is a cute and independent plant-based restaurant with tasty food and a warm and friendly staff. We had the cauliflower chickpea tacos, house- made black bean burger, sweet potato fries, and garlic and lentils and they all were delicious and satisfying. This restaurant is a nice and cozy addition to the valley's other great vegan places, with indoor and outdoor seating, and easy parking."}
{"text":"Loved this place! Wish it were closer to our house! Cauliflower chickpea tacos were super delicious and beautifully presented. Garlic lentils very nice. Large portion sizes. We will be back soon!"}
{"text":"I got my vegan Thanksgiving pre-ordered from Seed Shack and was very thankful during the whole meal. I didn't feel left out from the family dinner like I normally do. Plus it is so hard to find a genuinely GOOD vegan Mac & cheese and their whole menu is just great (as I've tried so far!). 
The owner, Jade, is such a dear and works way too hard to make this vegan restaurant a reality for all of us in the east valley. Definitely recommend. I'm very excited to try the oriental twist they're doing on the Impossible Burger!"}
{"text":"Golden milk was awesome! Also the cauliflower chickpea tacos are really special. You won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"My friends and I just tried The Impossible Burger.  It was absolutely delicious! We all agreed that it tasted like an authentic beef burger!  One friend responded \"That's it!  I'm sold.  I'll go vegan now!\"  
The location is a hidden and hard to miss...and the prices are a little high 
Great staff, great atmosphere, delicious food  A+"}
{"text":"Another vegan place. Good. Flavor of the food was much better than the offerings from other nearby vegan spots. Prices however were about the same and portions were a little small for the price. That's why 4 stars.
Upgrade to 5 stars. The jackfruit pita is awesome. Beyond burger decent but could be cooked a little more with more seasoning. 

Tips from the consumer: 
- Ditch the plastic to go bags!!! Hugely detrimental to the environment vs a paper bag customers can just throw I. Their compost. 
- use biodegradable plastic for forks, spoons, cups etc
- ditch the packets of ketchup and whatever other condiments. Also change brands. The stuff you are suing is mostly high fructose corn syrup and msg.  
- get gluten free buns for burgers and whatnot.

Bring back the rainbow bowl. Probably your best option. You just cut out your main gluten free dish

03/28/18
Raised to 4 stars because we go here so much but bring back the original recipe for the tofu bowl"}
{"text":"Came in late on a Friday and had my pup, they were kind enough to move a table and chairs outside for us. Great service! And the food was delicious."}
{"text":"I am in town visiting my mom and found this place on Yelp.  What a gem!!! I love this restaurant and so did my husband,  son and mother.  We ordered the truffle mac and cheese, chilli, two beyond burgers and the Buddha bowl.  Wow! Wow! Wow!  Plus... check out their Valentine's Day Special Event ;D"}
{"text":"Very very good food! Quality and consistency! You may have to wait a bit but it's soooo worth it!"}
{"text":"Love this place! Food was fresh, amazing, and affordable,  and the staff were friendly. Would definitely come back!"}
{"text":"I tried the potato tornado thing which was sooo good. Then the raw lettuce wraps which are very \"delicate\", but good. The dessert was bomb as well. I'll definitely be returning for more of the full menu stuff, but so far so good!"}
{"text":"Wow! I certainly enjoyed my vegan experience at Seed Shack. The Acai Seed Bowl is amazing!  My family and I enjoyed not only the food, but service so much that we dined here twice this weekend. Thank you Seed Shack!"}
{"text":"Food is so good! Service is great too! Food did not take long at all to come out either. Highly recommend for vegan option, however, overpriced."}
{"text":"Believe or not I ate all the food in the picture. I'll give a little review for each item below. But first the restaurant in general is cute w/ good music and the staff is nice. The location is slightly isolated so I hope they get more business.

The impossible burger: This burger was definitely unlike anything I've ever tried. A good way to put it is a Japanese take on the vegan burger. It tastes like a sushi roll and burger had a baby named peanut. 

The Bacon Mac and cheese: This was ok. The bacon was not bacon at all but maybe some weird bacon flavor cracker. On the other hand the macaroni was good but not great. It's just my opinion but I prefer al dente noodles and these were way past that.

The cauliflower tacos: These had a wonderful taste and I didn't read that they came with guacamole so that was a wonderful surprise. Sadly, there was very little cauliflower for each of the three tacos and it was mostly chickpeas.

All in all a good restaurant but I'm not sure if I would come back for the burger due to it being the most expensive item on the menu at 17$."}
{"text":"My first time here was a great experience! The girl at the counter was so friendly and patient with me. I recently discovered how amazing the Beyond Burger is and I was so excited to see they have it here! I got it with their homemade rice bacon (a little crunchy for my taste but that doesn't change how I feel about my experience!) - the Burger itself is HUGE! You have an option of regular potato or sweet potato fries so I just went with original and yuuuum!! Also, I only had to wait about ten minutes and my food was fresh & hot :)

I ended up leaving stuffed and with a peachy matcha smoothie in hand (also delicious!). I'm so happy that there is a vegan restaurant that is so close to home, I'll definitely be back and would recommend anyone and everyone to come here at least once!! :) Thank you for being so kind as well!!"}
{"text":"Delicious vegan food in a charming, welcoming setting. I had the chick pea cauliflower tacos. The they were delicious. I can't wait to come back."}
{"text":"I had the soup of the day with pita bread! Everything was fresh and flavorful. I will be back for more. The menu is very innovative and the owner is very welcoming. I'm so happy to have this great vegan restaurant in my backyard"}
{"text":"This is currently my favorite vegan restaurant. When I first arrived, they served cucumber water, which tastes like water with a slight hint of cucumber. It's actually pretty refreshing and not as weird as it sounds. There is a breakfast menu which is available all day long, which I find pleasing. As for my order, I tried the barbecue jackfruit pita with sweet potato fries. It was very tasty and I love the barbecue flavor it had. The fries are the best sweet potato fries I have ever ingested. Seriously, you must try them. I also had the coconut \"nice cream\" which had coconut shavings and chocolate chips on top. I could definitely taste the fresh coconut and the flavor is not watered-down at all like other coconut ice creams can be. As for the interior, there are small succulent plants on each table and colorful fruit-shaped pillows on the booth seats. There are even books to read. It's a nice environment with a positive atmosphere and I would definitely recommend Seed Shack to anyone who wants a healthy meal that also tastes amazing."}
{"text":"Cute restaurant with fantastic vegan food.  The bacon was so good I almost doubted it wasn't real and my Jack Russell kept begging to have me give her more.  I usually do not like the fake meats but this was an exception.  The only disadvantage would be it is too far from where I live."}
{"text":"I have to confess I am not a vegan, but decided to go to lunch here with the vegan side of the family. 
The food here was AMAZING! We all ordered something different for our lunch and then we all shared. 
We ordered buffalo cauliflower (if you like the sauce HOT then try this), chili ( lovely sweet and savory blend),
And the most fabulous  \"burger\" I have ever eaten.  I will definitely be ordering the beyond burger again!

We also indulged in a dessert, plantain and ice cream. The dessert was out of this world, I could live on this ice cream and probably loose a few pounds along the way."}
{"text":"Recently my girlfriend decided to become a vegetarian. We have been looking for new restaurants to eat at. We found Seed Shack and loved it. I ordered a burger and thought they'd brought me an actual beef burger patty by mistake only to find out it was all vegetables. This place is great and I don't have to feel like I killed a cow!! Great! I can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"We tried Seed Shack for the first time tonight. It was great. Clean, well lit and nicely decorated restaurant, pleasant peaceful music. The staff was very friendly and helpful. Prices are reasonable. My Wife and I loved the Macaroni and cheese. Everything is vegan, so the cheese was non-dairy. We also shared an order of Avocado toast which was also very good, served with a couple of slices of Bacon. I had the  Beyond Meat Beyond Burger, served with cheese and very good big french fries made in-house. You can also switch to Sweet Potato fries, which my Wife had with the Beet Burger. Everything was wonderful, we will make this a stop whenever we're in the area."}
{"text":"Quality healthy ingredients! Great for vegans and/or anyone else looking for a fresh meal. Quick service, cute decor, and fantastic staff. Beyond Beef burger tastes just like the real thing, while the beet burger will leave any plant based life-styler wanting more! Fries are amazing."}
{"text":"You know those restaurants that taste amazing while you're there, but then 5 minutes after eating you feel like garbage? Then you realize your meal was just a fried, salty, saucey mess. No wonder you feel that way! Well this place is the cure for that and had to be one of the best healthy options in the Mesa/Gilbert area. The entire menu is fantastic, well portioned, ant healthy! Seed shack is tucked away in a little shopping center but it's definitely worth going!"}
{"text":"This place is awesome! My husband and I are not vegetarian or vegan; we just enjoy trying different kinds of food. And this place was great - the food was delicious even for non-vegans! 

We got the beet burger and the rainbow tofu vermicelli. The tofu was deep fried to perfection, the noodles were really flavorful and had cabbage and carrot in it. The sweet potato fries were awesome - I highly recommend them. And the beet burger was very different, but very tasty as well with guacamole and hummus. 


If you're wanting something healthy, delicious and different, definitely check out this place."}
{"text":"Great food. Try the hummus and their burgers.  My husband is not vegan, but he couldn't stop talking about the food."}
{"text":"I ordered the hummus sampler and my friend got the avocado toast and we shared.  It was more than enough for us!!  And then we ordered the fried plantains that came with ice cream that wasn't ice cream!!  Frozen purple yams and coconut milk.   Amazing!!  Definitely like this place!!  After our meal and treat we did not feel the typical overstuffed which was refreshing!!   Off to get pedicures without gastric distress!!   Glad we came!!"}
{"text":"I Discovered this place and am very glad I did.  The food was excellent and the staff was very friendly.  Their menu is diverse with options for everyone.  I highly recommend this place to anyone looking for wholesome cuisine."}
{"text":"I was beyond excited to find a vegan restaurant in my neighborhood. The menu looked amazing, the decor was great , my server was so sweet and attentive. I ordered the beet burger. the sweet potato fries were awesome! However the beet burger was burnt on both sides and the bun was way too hard to even get your teeth through. My server was very sweet and she took it back offering something to replace it, so I asked for the soup of the day, a potato soup with onions and shredded carrot. When I received the soup it was cold- the potatoes were basically cut up french fries and the onions were raw, but the flavor of the broth was fairly good. Overall super disappointed, great idea- poor execution. I did also order a Thai tea which was really good with the coconut cream."}
{"text":"Very friendly and good food. A bit pricey for the portions but overall good!"}
{"text":"I decided to stop in during lunch and I'm glad I did.

The lady at the register greeted me and walked over to me as soon as I walked in the restaurant. 
the place was definitely clean and the music was relaxing, Definitely a laid back vide.

Their menu is not too crazy but there's enough to keep you happy and satisfied. It is a little on the pricy end but it's understandable for the type of food that they are providing. 

I ordered the Black Bean Burger and a Passion Fruit Green Tea (unsweetened) 

Omg let me tell you it tasted amazing. 
The black bean patty did not taste dry or brittle.
The lemon tahini was not over powering and mixed in very good with the whole thing. 
Omg The sweet potato fries were so good and I just wanted more and more. 
The drink in itself was yummy and very thirst quenching and I'm glad I went with it. Actually did not taste like it was unsweetened but oh well. Haha 

The only down side to this place is the cost but I mean it's kinda understandable. 

I would definitely recommend this place to people in the area. I'll be returning at some point to try out some other things on their menu. 
A+ guys

Oh also their to go box was very nicely backed in my opinion."}
{"text":"My S/O took me out for a date night at Seed Shack. Immediately upon walking in, I fell in love with the clean fresh vibe and bright decor. It's a small restaurant tucked into the back of a promenade. It's definitely difficult to find, but so worth the drive from the West Valley.

The staff consisted of two adults in their late 20s that were more than happy to explain the menu and what some of the menu items were. As a vegan of many years, I loved how understanding and aware they were. 

We shared the truffle mac & cheese, a beyond meat \"bacon cheeseburger\", and caramelized plantains with yam \"nice cream\". Everything had a men's, unique flavor and beautiful plating. We went on a weeknight and it was very quiet. I bet it's busier on the weekends. This place is relatively new and is definitely on the up and up. Excellent job!"}
{"text":"Awesome little spot.  The specialty burger was super tasty and the sweet potato fries were perfect!  The beet burger had good flavor but lacked consistency, very mushy.  Service is excellent, staff is very attentive."}
{"text":"I feel so lucky to have the Seed Shack so close to my home. I have visited several times and have been impressed with everything I've ordered. All of of the dishes are so flavorful, creative, healthy and delicious. That combination is rare! Some of my favorites are the beet burger with sweet potato fries, jackfruit pita with lentils and cauliflower chickpea tacos. Also, the ambiance and decor is great and the owner Jade is just the sweetest. It doesn't matter if you're an omnivore, vegetarian or vegan because I think anyone would enjoy their experience at Seed Shack."}
{"text":"Very cute restaurant at the end of a near-defunct strip mall.  Cuisine is Asian-vegan fusion and very good.  The fried zucchini with bulgur chili appetizer was solid, and the black bean burger was excellent--in fact, one of the best I've tried.  However, the fried tofu was sorta meh (albeit crispy), sort of like it needed to be marinated first.  Overall, I would rate this place a solid four stars for the food, but I have to dock one star for the steep price point.  $40 for two to eat lunch there while drinking tap water.  Two drinks with our meal would have put us well above $50.  So, three stars it is.  Friendly service and worth a try if you happen to be in the area."}
{"text":"This is a super cute little place. The decor is simple yet nice and inviting. The owner is very sweet and welcoming. 

The menu is completely vegan. I've never had a completely vegan meal, on purpose. I tried the avocado toast and the detox juice. The juice is slightly sweet but has a great earthy taste. Exactly what I'm looking for in a beer based juice. The avocado taste well, that was simply amazing. 9 grain bread, lightly toasted and covered with fresh mashed avocado, cherry tomatoes, almond feta and walnuts. It is served with two slices of vegan bacon as well. 

This was an impromptu stop as I was driving by but I will definitely come back."}
{"text":"I tried the Buffalo Cauliflower, PB&J Impossible Burger with sweet potato fries, & Thai Iced Tea. Hands down the best PB &J \"burger\" I've ever had! All the different flavors/textures brought something different to the table (cucumber, strawberry Sambal jelly, wonton crisp, & miso peanut butter).  I only ate half of it & I was so full. The flavors in this thing are amazing & you wouldn't even know it's not a \"real\" burger! Their  Thai Iced tea is probably the best I've ever had."}
{"text":"Amazing vegan place. What impressed me is that they serve you cucumber water and totally cools you down.

Ordered -
Jackfruit BBQ Pita - tasted super delicious. Jackfruit was fried, never had something like this before. Comes with a side of Couscous mix. 
Couscous is lil bland.
CBD infused Kombucha (prickly pear) - not so great but the ginger ones tasted amazing.

Price is lil higher compared to other vegan restaurants. Good ambience, less crowded. 
Would rate this place a 4.5."}
{"text":"THE BEST nice cream and fried plantains ever... had to come back again just for dessert!! Also their matcha is very good and pairs well with the nice cream and plantains!"}
{"text":"Fresh , vibrant , and guilt free , love seeing a new Alternative eatery with delicious solid menu items."}
{"text":"Home style cooking. Hip place. Friendly staff :)"}
{"text":"Delicious whole vegan food! Highly recommend the CBD infused Kombucha, hummus plate, and cauliflower tacos! I will be back!"}
{"text":"I came up to the Chandler area for some business and found this cool little place online. It inside the court is beautiful with a funky vibe. The owner herself and sister work the tables and the kitchen. The owner came out to offer us our menus and something to drink. The menu (of which I didn't take a pic since so many were already on here) is pretty straightforward. But the thing I didn't notice was the \"golden milk\", which she highly recommended. I ordered it. I was not disappointed. Golden milk is coconut milk that they add Turmeric, maple syrup, and a few spices. It was rich and creamy and delicious. No bitter taste at all!

I had a Buddha bowl-- which comes with ancient cooked grains, grilled asparagus and tomato with spinach. The grill taste was absolutely present and delicious. The only comment I have that is negative is... For 14 or $15, the portion size is quite small. My other half have a jackfruit \"BBQ\" pita. It was absolutely delicious. We also were able to change out the side for a salad. But they forgot to put any dressing on it. Ding number two! 

Still the food was really fresh and very tasty. I am grateful for yelp giving a 20% off coupon, because I do think the prices were a bit steep."}
{"text":"We are not vegan. That being said, this place rocks. The food is so thoughtfully made and flavorful. The owner is amazingly sweet. The pulled \"pork\" flatbread was amazing as well as the beyond burger. Would highly recommend this place even to those who are not vegan/vegetarian!"}
{"text":"It is in small corner near Fry's market. The hostess is nice and swift to get you table. The atmosphere is casual but intimate enough for family and date. The food is really good. Order the Beyond burger and it is amazing but I should ask less onion next time. Will be back for the Mac and cheese."}
{"text":"Try Seed Shack! It's off of Baseline and ValVista. They have THE BEST impossible burger I have had in the valley. Love their take on it. 

My review:
My wife and I have been here twice. The second time we brought our son. We tried the tornados, mac n cheese, cauliflower tacos, ginger carrot soup, beet burger, chicken sandwish, & the impossible burger. 

In short, it was all amazing. We actually went there twice, yesterday & back again today. 

The tornados are lightly battered and fried spiraled either potato or zucchini. Both were amazing. They had a nice seasoning too. 

The mac and cheese was light with crispy bacon bits. Very delicious. 

The cauliflower tacos with chickpeas were incredible. I have never eaten chickpeas that tasted so good. 

My wife had the soup today and loved it. It was creamy and tasty. 

I had the beet burger yesterday. It was hearty and full of beet flavor. If you love beets, you'll like it. My wife wasn't a fan, but she doesn't like earthy stuff like that. I loved it. 

Now... Their impossible burger was the best I have had yet. I've had a couple in the valley, and this one was way better. It was a miso-peanut butter, crispy wonton with a hint of spice jam. Holy hell. It was insane. The patty was cooked perfect. The combo of flavors was off the charts. 

The chicken sandwish did not disappoint either. It was insane and I would definitely get this again as well. 

Overall, all of their food was amazing. I am so excited my family has a wonderful place to go on the east valley. You gotta check it out. 

Oh yeah - we also had the golden milk. It was super delicious."}
{"text":"Best restaurant made Golden Milk, HANDs DOWN!!!
Also, the Purple Yam nice cream was super yummy and satisfying; sweet enough without the agave! Mmm mmm mmm!"}
{"text":"Not very conscious of gluten free orders and food was greasy. Not the \"healthy\" feeling that we went to this place for. There are MUCH better vegan places nearby. My husband and I came here to split a burger and ordered a gluten free bun. The waitress talked to us about it and confirmed that we were okay with $2 up charge. We said of course. Burger came with regular bun, but they didn't tell us. I didn't realize until after two bites."}
{"text":"Food Allergy and Vegan yay!! They have the beyond burger and tons of food variety. The staff is nice and compassionate. Thank you Seed Shack!"}
{"text":"The beyond burger was absolutely amazing. The sweet potato fries were good but a little undercooked and salty but not awful. It's nice to have a vegan restaurant so close. Customer service was excellent and very friendly. Loved the decor inside."}
{"text":"This cute restaurant offers many vegan options that taste delicious. Great customer service. Would recommend!!!"}
{"text":"Loved this place! I'm not vegetarian but this food was great. Very unique menu with a lot of good options, we got 4 different things and everything was delicious. Will definitely have to come back to try the rest!"}
{"text":"This little gen is a pleasant addition for anyone eating plant based or not! I tried the burger impossible which was the special of the day and it was delicious. Soy based burger with a crispy wonton. Topped with miso peanut butter and strawberry jelly. The cucumber made it extra yummy. My lunch came with sweet potato fries and a small lettuce salad. The potato's were on the soft side but I am guessing because they don't fry them. I will definitely return."}
{"text":"The food was outstanding!!! I ordered the Thai tea and curry lentil soup. My sister and i shared the hummus platter. Fresh and delicious food. 
I am coming back again and will recommend this place to everyone."}
{"text":"Had the house made black bean burger,  it was pretty delicious. Came with fresh,  homemade sweet potato fries, which I also enjoyed.  The mixed berry smoothie is yummy too. It's quaint & cozy with inviting decor. I would recommend eating here & also return to try something else because there were a couple of menu items that seem to be all the rage as far as reviews are concerned. Service was great as well although they weren't at all busy.  Look forward to trying it again."}
{"text":"Just outstanding taste! I am so happy there is an owner operated place here instead of a chain place. It is different, it is healthy! We will be back often!"}
{"text":"1. Had a fantastic lunch with my wife. Food and service were both excellent and the portion size was perfect. We had the Buddha Bowl and the BBQ Jackfruit Pita. Definitely coming back

2. Back again. Seed Shack never fails to serve delicious food with great service. Love this place."}
{"text":"This place is awesome! I had the chili, very good, flavorful. We got the buffalo cauliflower, also fabulous with a yummy avocado dip. My man got the beyond burger and sweet potato fries, also very tasty! Service and food were excellent. Chill place, clean and cute decor. A must for lunch. We will be back!"}
{"text":"This little gem of a place was so delicious!!!! I got the 'Beyond Burger' with sweet potato fries, and it was beyond delicious. They don't have gf buns yet, but the server said they were coming. I didn't miss it though, they gave me extra greens, and the light balsamic dressing and the sauce the put on the side was so yummy. It was also my first taste of cashew cheese, and it was really good. Portion size was just right.. even a few fries left on my plaFree WiFi, and lots of light.. definitely a place to chill and eat. Lots of smoothie and breakfast options served all day."}
{"text":"This place is sooo good! Probably the best Vegan place in Gilbert. Be careful though, because once you try it, you will be addicted. I went 3 times in one week  My favorite so far is the Cauliflower Tacos and the Fried Plantains.  My husband who is a definite meat lover, was surprised that the Beyond Burger was not real meat. He kept looking at it and asking if we were SURE it wasn't meat. Haha! I am also not Vegan, but Seed Shack really has some yummy food. I definitely will be back....maybe for lunch today"}
{"text":"This is a cute little place located in a strip of businesses connected to a Fry's. The atmosphere is calm, they had calming, peaceful instrumental music playing. There is ample seating, and cute fruit shaped pillows lining the booths on the wall. The menu features healthy vegetarian, vegan dishes, salads, amd smoothies. Our server was by right away after we sat down with 2 ice cold glasses of cucumber water. So refreshing! Upon reviewing the menu, I decided on the hummus sampler and a half-salad. Soon after ordering our food arrived, the hummus plate looked and tasted amazing. It featured three types of hummus, fresh veggies and pita bread. My salad was wonderful as well. A small bowl filled with lettuce, cucumber, tomatoes with oil and vinegar for dressing. Everything was so fresh and yummy. I had to bring some leftovers home as I couldn't eat everything! This place is great, and I will be back to taste other menu selections!"}
{"text":"Fantastic vegetarian restaurant!
We tried the beyond burger with sweet potato fries, the avocado toast, and the fried plantains with coconut nice cream. Everything was perfect!"}
{"text":"I love this place, I just wish they were open more hours/days. The east side needs more restaurants like this one. Good gluten free options."}
{"text":"Not many healthy eateries around but this one is worth a try.  Our service was excellent, food tasted great and the menu had a decent variety of plant based choices.  The buffalo cauliflower appetizer was something you could easily make at home but who wants to do that when you can come here and have an entire meal of other yummy items as well.  They are not visible from the street and are in the back of a commercial area but well worth the trip.  I know other reviews had some negative things to say about service but we did not encounter that at all."}
{"text":"Had one of the vegan burgers and was SUPER impressed! Everything was very fresh and delicious. Will definitely come back"}
{"text":"Never thought vegan food would taste so good!! Makes me feel like it's so easy to be healthy. 
I tried their \"bacon\" that's made out of rice paper and honestly it tastes better than real bacon! 
My boyfriend who loves to eat meat also enjoyed the food because how great the flavor is.
Also the avocado smoothie is the best! 
It's a family owned place and they are passionate about making healthy and flavorful food everyone could enjoy."}
{"text":"Food was good and the ladies were very patient explaining the menu to me since I'm newly vegan. I will be back to try other items!"}
{"text":"The impossible burger was delicious served with vegan cheese . Started with humas trio Finish the meal with chocolate hummus.. smooth with a terrific dark coco taste
Go and try.. looks like family owned to. Provide  them the support"}
{"text":"This is my first time here. It is tucked back in a shopping center that if you do not know it is here, you won't see it - so seek it out! This little vegan place is cute and comfortable and inviting. The owners are there and doing all the work - they need support to keep up this growing business. We had the Impossible Burger and OMG it was amazing. The Burger itself is not \"homemade\" by the restaurant but they created an epic flavoring for the burger to be topped with. I did not want it to end, I was sad when I took the last bite because it was over. The complimenting sweet potato fries were delicious too. This little place is not to be missed. You do not have to be \"vegan\" to enjoy this healthy alternative."}
{"text":"I've always heard great things about Seed Shack and I'm a HUGE fan of the beyond burger so I finally decided to come here with my wife and holy moly. Best beyond burger I've ever had. ANd they had gluten free buns available amazing. And the service is we incredible. If you ever have the chance PLEASE come support these amazing humans!"}
{"text":"My lunch was wonderful, And the presentation was fantastic. I can't wait to go back and try something else."}
{"text":"My wife is vegan.So that inspires me to find a good vegan restaurant for her.

Touch down we found one of the best.
Pretty impressed with the interior decor.
We ordered bean burger, mac and cheese and fries.
 We liked the burger a lot..with crunchy onion and vegetables in the middle.
The mac and cheese is to die for...I am not a fan of it but when i sampled one..I loved it.

The onlt con was we ordered buffalo cauliflower and it was raw..since they baked it.

Other than that for their reasonable pricing i would give 5 star."}
{"text":"Delicious vegan restaurant tucked away in a parking lot with no lights... we almost missed it! Glad we found Seed Shack, though, because it's amazing even if you're a meat eater. I recommend the Beyond Meat burger. The Mac and cheese is good, too. Lemonade is tasty. Kid loved it, too!"}
{"text":"The food was very good. We were very impressed with the food and the service here. I would recommend this place to anyone whether vegan or not. We will be coming back here for sure. The only negative was that the prices are a higher than I would like. If the prices were lower then we would be eating here a couple times a week for sure."}
{"text":"We ordered the beyond burger and rainbow tofu. Was really excited to try this spot, but man was I disappointed. The sweet potato and potato fries were oily, soggy, and half cooked. The tofu, far from crispy, under seasoned. The only decent thing was the beyond burger. Paid $46 for 3 meals, and I would have been better off going to chipotle. Would not go here again. Save your money!"}
{"text":"So unfortunately I have to give the Seed Shack 3 stars.
1 Star for the flavors
2 Nd Star for the great customer service
3 rd Star for the overall goodness
However the stars that were not received...  I really wanted to give them 5 stars, were not given because did not get my order correct I asked for everything on the side. Also the bread on my beyond burger (delicious burger) was burnt so bad I could not begin to eat it and my fries as well... I can't believe they even gave it to me. If I wasn't so far away I would have returned the food but to far to drive back. If I was to come to the area again I would return and check my food and have some conversation. My 3 stars still stand because they shouldn't have given it out looking like this. I will say again the flavors were delicious!!!"}
{"text":"Love the detox juice. Great little quite place for people who love yummy vegan food! Glad this place came to our neighborhood!"}
{"text":"Sweet and very helpful server! Great flavors and reaonable prices for a vegan spot. The music and ambiance are clean, chill, and good vibes. This spot is kind of hidden, but worth finding!"}
{"text":"Excellent food! Try the jackfruit entrée. It taste like pulled pork and is super delicious. Also the golden milk is something brand new to me and we delicious as well. If you want to eat healthy vegan this is a good spot check out"}
{"text":"So delicious! Went here with a friend, who got the vermicelli, and I got the beet burger. Both absolutely delicious, and the waitress was super sweet. Will definitely be going here again!"}
{"text":"Excellent food . Wonderful staff. Definitely in the restaurant rotation . Go see for yourself , you won't be disappointed ."}
{"text":"I cannot say enough about this place.
My husband booked the Valentine's dinner last night and O.M.G. ,how amazing everything was.
Dim lights with candles  , they gave us a warm infused tea tree oil towel to use ,as some food was finger food.
The food was amazing,with a delicate taste and plated like a gourmet restaurant;i believe whoever works in the kitchen knows their job and put heart and soul in it.
The ladies who were running the food were great, smiling and knowledgeable about food .
This is The Place to go,Vegan or not,for great food and great atmosphere. 
Finaly a real Vegan place in the valley .

5 stars are not enough for this place."}
{"text":"I dined with a friend who is vegan.  Neither of us had ever tried this restaurant so we had lunch.  She had the macaroni and \"cheese\" and I had the \"hamburger\".  I have not had such delicious food in a long time!  I am suspect of vegan burgers as they have been bland-but this was excellent-hand cut sweet potato fries and the cucumber water is simply wonderful and refreshing.  Dessert was fried plantains and every bite fantastic.  We had excellent service and I will be a frequent customer. This establishment could convince me to eat vegan forever!"}
{"text":"Ordered takeout & was not disappointed! Highly recommend the fried plantains! They were the best dessert I have ever had in my life. As my main meal I ordered the beet burger. Was pretty good however only came with one piece of bread so that sort of threw me off. Prices are very high too. Other than that, everything was amazing!"}
{"text":"The Beyond Burger was amazing! All the ingredients were fresh and tasty. The fries were perfectly seasoned as well.  A great dining experience.  I must come back for breakfast.  All Phoenix area vegans must check this place out. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"This place is awesome! Ordered many things off the menu and they were all delish! Very fresh and homemade! I am vegan and gluten free and this place is the bomb!!!! I highly recommend it. My new fave!!!"}
{"text":"This place is awesome. Beyond Meat burger with gluten free bun was the best I've had. I would recommend this place to any vegan.  I would also take non-vegans for the Beyond Meat burger.  Keep up the great work!!"}
{"text":"I love this place. The kids Mac and cheese is the best! I wasn't a fan of the truffle Mac and cheese though. The impossible burger was so yummy! The only reason I'm not giving a 5 Star is because of the truffle Mac and cheese and the buffalo cauliflower. It was basically just boiled cauliflower with hot sauce. Would highly recommend this place though! Can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"Finally!! Mesa gets an amazing vegan restaurant!
This quaint little spot is tucked back in val vista lakes near Fry's and is worth the drive from anywhere in the valley. The staff is friendly and helpful and I'm so happy I heard about this place. I've had the truffle Mac and cheese and the beyond burger with their house made cashew cheese. It's all good. Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Went here with my sister and mother in law for Mother's Day. Absolutely fabulous! The place was so clean and open. There were so many vegan options! Everyone was friendly and knowledgeable. The food and drinks were absolutely delicious!!!! I ordered the beyond burger, my girls ordered the Buddha bowl and the beat burger with the golden milk and Thai tea. Everything was amazing. We want to come back every week to try something new! Would absolutely recommend."}
{"text":"Location, location, location ... not going to lie, this is a tough spot to find. The forgotten end of sea of never ending strip malls. Once you're inside you'll find the restaurant is tropical themed with a few tables along the wall, a few more in the middle, and a \"specials\" board along the wall. 

The food is all vegan and very, very tasty. The only reason I knocked off a star is that the french fries were a bit soggy. When I order fries, I want them to be super crispy. We tried the impossible burger as well as the tacos and it was all super tasty. I would say the burger was the big winner, not necessarily because of the burger itself, but the flavors that the chef mixed together were amazing ... peanut butter, jelly, other stuff, it was delicious.

The service is great, the restaurant is small and you feel the love of the family that owns and runs it. 

Overall I would say it's worth a visit regardless of whether or not you're a vegan. I just wish it was a little closer to my home and that the prices were a smidgen less (certainly wouldn't' keep me from returning)"}
{"text":"Silver lining to having to drive across town for less than pleasant errands is finally getting to Seed Shack, who I had been following on Instagram for a while  I am never in Gilbert but, man, this was delicious! What an adorable, bright gem of a vegan eatery  I had the tofu vermicelli and it was the perfect combo of flavors and textures. Yummy! Clean, bright cheerful atmosphere and service."}
{"text":"Love this new restaurant. Staff are so welcoming and the menu is varied. Ingredients are fresh and we have eaten there three times and each time loved it. I don't have a favorite because each thing I've eaten so far has been so good - maybe a sneaking preference for the beet burger."}
{"text":"Very nice atmosphere. Very excited about the many plant based choices available and in the East Valley. $17 for a burger and to not toast the bun was the cause for 4 stars."}
{"text":"I love this place! It's the closest vegan restaurant to my house and the food here is delicious. I love the sweet potato toast"}
{"text":"I loved this place. I have decided I want to go back once a week to make sure I try everything on the menu. I had their Mac and \"cheese\" and I loved it. It was topped with a crispy topping which I was told was toasted seasoned rice paper .. unusual and delish. I also had the chickpea and cauliflower taco.... delish and gave me ideas for my own tacos. I had enough of both to bring home for my dinner!!! Heaven"}
{"text":"My husband and I was so excited to try this place and it did not disappoint! Located next to the lakes at Val Vista Lakes, this hidden gem should not be hidden. I hope everyone who wants to try some amazing healthy plant based food will stop by at least weekly! I know we are because it's right in our neighborhood. We tried the grilled cauliflower Tacos and the Tofu Veggie scramble along with the Peachy Macha and Creamy Avocado smoothies.  I couldn't resist the Fried Plaintain dessert which is to die for!!! Customer service is friendly and fast. The prices are right along with the restaurant standards for fresh healthy food. We left stuffed and happy customers and will be back again soon."}
