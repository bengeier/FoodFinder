{"text":"The server was super friendly and food was delicious . I had the breakfast special, great value ."}
{"text":"I eat here at least once per week. Mondays feature noodles, alternating between beef and chicken, Tuesdays: Perch, Thursdays: Prime rib, Fridays: AYCE Walleye. I love their potato soup. Their country fried steak dinner, sometimes the Wednesday dinner special is really great. Saturday lunch is sometimes roast pork with stuffing, mashed potatoes and another side. Saturday dinner is sometimes baby back ribs. Both are delicious. The Sunday lunch is pan-fried chicken with 3 sides. They have an assortment of homemade pies. But as the previous review says, they run out. Especially the ribs, the prime rib, and dessert. Nice wait staff, and pretty quick. But parking is somewhat limited and so is seating. But that's what being a diner is all about. Free refills on soft drinks. My favorite side is their macaroni salad. All the food tastes like homemade. Portions are very generous. I have never been disappointed!"}
{"text":"Great restaurant. The food is good and the staff is friendly. The place is very clean and the pie is good. I like the Hamburgers as they are good and they have good fries as well."}
{"text":"This place has a good selection of home-style cooking. I have tried multiple selections here and all have been decent to good. They run specials quite often, but are known for running out, since they have a good base of clientele. Unfortunately their healthier options are very limited, but the salad that you can order is pretty good sized and comes with a bit above average toppings, variety and amount. The main issue with this location is the parking situation and the total occupancy. But, the great thing about it is that it's right across from an awesome hidden gem of a cheesecake seller, Mystical Retreat Cheesecake, so you can settle for a slice while you wait and it will make you forget about the time waiting."}
{"text":"This has just the menu you'd expect in a small town but with the quality you want but rarely get. Their speciality is the fried pike and it was delicious. Even though it is not locally caught it still tasted very fresh and not at all fishy. The sides were the standard processed stuff (boxed mashed potatoes and canned green beans) but nothing is perfect."}
{"text":"We don't live nearby, about a 1 1/2 hr drive, but we're going today,We usually go a few times a year. It's a good place to eat some homestyle cooking at a great price after a nice drive! The cheesecake place across the road tops it off  just fine."}
{"text":"This place is great. All food is excellent home style cooking. Sometimes service is a little slow but it's worth it! Highly recommend the Paxton in bainbridge Ohio!!!"}
{"text":"Extremely tasty home cooked food. Finding \"down home\" food nowadays is such a rare occurrence, that it really is a treat when you stumble upon a restaurant such as this. I had the country fried steak, which was flavorful and left me looking forward to coming back. The prices were reasonable and the servers were friendly."}
